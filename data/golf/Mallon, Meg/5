 Q.   So Meg, just sum up I guess how you feel at 7 p.m. on Sunday.   
MEG MALLON:   Yeah, it's not the result that we wanted, obviously.   And we still felt like we had a chance to win it today, even when we had the rain delay.   
The team gathered around and we felt like they could turn around all their matches and win this.   So I just really appreciate the effort that they gave and they fought hard until the end.   
But, unfortunately, today was a European day, for us, but they played some great golf this week and really deserved the win.  
   
 Q.   Anything stand out to you this week?   Something, a player, something you would have changed, anything in your mind right now?  
MEG MALLON:   Not really.   I think that we, the way we played 16, 17 and 18, I think really is what made the difference.   It wasn't for lack of preparation, because we played this golf course quite a bit.   So it wasn't like it was a surprise for us, it was just a matter of who dropped the putts on those holes and unfortunately it was the Europeans.  
   
 Q.   What can you say about a player like Caroline Hedwall who went 5â€‘0, the first time, there's nothing you can do to stop that.   
MEG MALLON:   No, she played some great golf.   Obviously she may call this course her home now, because she really played some spectacular golf.   But what you're seeing is the future of the Solheim Cup, which is in really good hands.   And it is one competitive in any event.   And you're going to see a lot of these young players going at it for a long time.  
   
 Q.   What will you say to your friend Lotta Neumann, who you've known forever?  
MEG MALLON:   Yeah, you know what, I'm glad I talked her into being captain.   I knew that she would have the best experience of her life and I'm happy for her and I'm proud of her.
