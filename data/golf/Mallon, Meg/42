Q.  Meg, you and Kelly matched up well today.  Number 17 got you a kick in. 

MEG MALLON:   If the wind wasn't blowing that way, I think that would have gone in.  That's the way match play goes.  You always expect someone to hole it, and I almost did it.


Q.  Your team is matched very well today?

MEG MALLON:  Our game is incredibly different.  We've never played together in six Solheim cups.  I was excited because we're two kids from Michigan and we had a lot of fun, too.


Q.  That birdie on the front helped a lot, too?

MEG MALLON:  It did.  We hung in there, and that's what it's all about.


Q.  You got a half point and that's very about right now.
