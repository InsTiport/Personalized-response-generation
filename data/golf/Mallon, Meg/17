Q.  Meg, this is such a moment for you.  The all time point getter in Solheim Cup history.
MEG MALLON:  Whatever, my team is 6 and 3, that's all that matters.  I'm so proud of these guys today, this European team was playing great golf, and we had to play exceptional to beat them.  What a match.  It's going to get better and better every time we play.
Q.  You know that you were on the receiving end of this, and you know how Karen Stupples feels, in 1992 you were Karen Stupples.
MEG MALLON:  Yes, and Catrin Nilsmark beat me.  I'll never forget that feeling.  It was a tough way to feel, but what a great feeling this was.  It's unbelievable to play for your country and play in front of these fans, and this has just been amazing this week.
Q.  Who was the 13th member of the Solheim Cup team?
MEG MALLON:   The fans were unbelievable.  What Rosie Jones did for us in the first few days, and Nancy Lopez's guidance, Christina Kim's enthusiasm, we had an incredible team.
Q.  Congratulations.
