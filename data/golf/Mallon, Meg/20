Q.  Pretty impressive stuff.  It was an important thing the way things changed this morning.

MEG MALLON:  I'm going to take the saddle and spurs off and let Rosie have a rest.  This was unbelievable golf today.
Q.  14 was pretty impressive there as well.

MEG MALLON:  That 14, it was key for us to do that.  We knew 15 would be a tough hole for us.  It turned out great.  Rosie played awesome today.
Q.  Rosie, five birdies for the first six holes.

ROSIE JONES:  I quit counting, but it was just    I was reading it really well, the greens today, and I had a really good feel.

I started to get a little sloppy on the back side but Meg was right there and we're glad to take the point.
Q.  How things changed so dramatically in the foursome matches, what were your thoughts?

ROSIE JONES:  I didn't really know when we went out on the first two holes that we had lost those matches or tied them up.  It was a little disappointing, but we're stressing staying strong right now and getting better as we go.
Q.  Congratulations.

MEG MALLON:  Thanks a lot.

ROSIE JONES:  Thanks.
