Q.  There's a lot of activity down here.  Really excited American team.  These two players, you were absolutely dynamite on that Back 9.

Tell us what went on inside your body, particularly coming down 18.

MEG MALLON:  I don't know what went on in my body, but I want some of that in me tomorrow.  I needed it.  Rosie helped me all day today, both of us started clicking on 14 and 15.  That was the best match I've been a part of.
Q.  The excitement of the last hole, Rosie was vintage Jones.

ROSIE JONES:  That's got to be the best putt I've ever made.  I got a good line because she was only a foot from me on the same line, same place.  I changed it just a little bit.  I went straight at it.  Meg played great on the back side.  It was perfect, unbelievable.

MEG MALLON:  It was just a perfect match.  They played great, too.

ROSIE JONES:  It's what it's all about.
Q.  Congratulations, and we've still got good golf to watch.

MEG MALLON:  Hopefully the Buckeyes will do as well as we did
