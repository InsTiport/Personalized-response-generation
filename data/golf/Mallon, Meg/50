 NEAL REID:  Let's go over your score card real quick.
MEG MALLON:   No. 6, I hit a pitching wedge to let's call it 15 feet, and made that for birdie.
No. 7, I hit a 7-wood to 5 feet and made that for birdie.
Then we go all the way to 14.  14, I got really lucky, I tried to punch a 5-iron just to left side of the green, and it went high left and hit it and it rolled right down and almost went it, knocked it about 12 feet by and I made that for birdie.
Then 16, bad drive, hit it in the bunker, tough hole to do that on.  I got a little break and hit a cart over there and came back towards the green, but still had a tough pitch shot there.  I was actually happy to make bogey on that hole.
17, that was a bad bogey.  Hit the wrong club there, hit it long, a tough little downhill pitch shot and didn't execute it very well. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   I left myself probably a good 15, 16 feet there.
I hit a 5-iron.  Too much.  And that is that.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   16, I hit my drive and it was left-to-right wind and I cut it a little too much and actually it hit the fairway side, kicked right, and hit the top of the bunker and rolled back in, a bunker off the tee, and tried to hit a 5-iron high up in the air and ended up cutting too much.  And I think I hit a golf cart over there or something over there on 16, but it knocked it back left, fortunately.  So there is a good bogey.  That was a good bogey there, I guess.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   Well, I was off of that fringe, so I think there was six behind the hole, so probably 18, 20 feet.

Q.  (Inaudible.) Blue-haired lady?
MEG MALLON:   I couldn't see where it was going.  And my caddie yelled Fore.  It was the only one that yelled fore, and I couldn't believe when I saw where it was.  There was a lot of people around that cart.  And fortunately, it didn't hit anybody.  I don't want to do that again this year, I've done that before and it's a horrible feeling.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   It was a weird day, because I hit some really good golf shots and didn't execute on the putts and then had a couple of breaks and made those birdies, like on 14. 
I'm going into 15, hit a great wedge shot in there about four or five feet and I feel I'm going to go to nine under and just overread the break.  Se Ri hit a putt behind me and I was drooling over this putt because her went right and I knew exactly where to hit it, right outside the left edge, and it just stayed right down the line there.  So I don't go to nine, and I make my mistakes on 16 and 17, and I came right back.  You can't do that stuff and win a golf tournament. I have to minimize those a little bit better.
It was a left-to-right wind.  All day I was fighting a cut and coming over it a little bit.  And any time I had a left-to-right wind today, I just really fought it.  And that's what happened on 16 and I ended up making a mistake on it.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   I'm Irish.  It has to come out once in a while, otherwise we fall apart if we don't let it go.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:  Well, I've made mistakes in a lot of golf tournaments.  I won the Open and made two doubles.  When it's a tight-packed leaderboard like this and people -- Rachel Teske shoots 6 under.  Someone is going to do that.  That's what I mean.  You can't give too many back because there is going to be somebody around you that's going to shoot a low number.  That's what I feel like when I'm out there playing.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   I guess the intimidation is the fact that she's on a roll.  She's won ten events and you know that she's not going to make many mistakes, as I said yesterday.  That's what comes out.  I don't know if it's intimidating.  It's just a fact.  That's what you face when you go out and play, when there is a player playing like that.  My generation has seen it.  Even 16 years on tour, I've seen it from the Super 6 that played in the '80s and early '90s, same thing, when one of those guys were on the leaderboard, it was the same situation. 
I've been through the generation of greats and how they handle it when they're on a roll, and it's pretty impressive.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   If I make a lot of birdies, like yesterday.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   Juli and I are very good friends.  Actually, I knew when I saw the pairings that day, I knew what was going to happen.  I knew if Juli was playing with Shani Waugh, She would be very comfortable.  Annika was playing behind her and that's Juli's field.  When you put her in a match-play situation, she loves it.  She won the amateur there before.  I wasn't surprised, but it sure was excite to go watch her do it.  It was great golf.  And Annika didn't lay down either.  Both sides were playing great.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   I was just happy for Juli.  Juli and I have the same teacher so I know how she -- she works so hard and she was fighting with her golf swing before that week and she was very upset with how she was playing, so I was personally just happy for her, because of the way she just fights through her struggles like that and comes back and can win a U.S. Open.  It's inspiring.  When you're someone that's three or four years younger than her and know that you don't die at 40.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   They gave me a hat.  I'm actually promoing the Ohio State/Michigan game on Saturday.  Someone figured it out for me.  If we play in less than four hours I could possibly catch the last ten minutes of the game.  Wouldn't that be fun? 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   Well, I'm staying at home.  Actually, I am going to tape the game.  I'm looking forward to watching it.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   It's not going to happen.  Every year they've played and I've been in this tournament -- all day today, the marshals, "Go Buckeyes," there's so many Ohio State games out here.  So it's impossible not to know what the score is out here tomorrow. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   I haven't seen Kelly yet, but I saw the article.  I'll give her a call, see what she wants to do.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   I don't know when this cold snap is supposed to happen.  I thought it was supposed to happen this afternoon.  I thought it was going to be like 49 degrees tomorrow morning.  We're playing early, at 9 or 10 o'clock.  Tomorrow.  Have you heard that? 
Actually, I need to go out and hit balls because I need to get rid of this over-the-top thing I've got going.  I need to hit the ball better tomorrow, like I did yesterday.  I only hit 12 greens today.  That's just not enough to make the birdies I need to make. 
I was encouraged by some shots.  My wedge shots were super today.  I hit a lot of close shots with my wedges, but my driver wasn't as solid.  I need to find the greens a little more tomorrow.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   A little bit, especially when it's a left-to-right wind, and that's a bad combination. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
MEG MALLON:   I hope it switches.  There are some holes with that wind I don't like.
