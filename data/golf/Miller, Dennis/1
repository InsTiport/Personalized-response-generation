 Q.   You want to enjoy a lot of sleep, but the scores aren't what you want, but it's also a tough test?  
DENNIS MILLER:   You've got to realize that it is hard.   And you're playing the best players in the world.   I'm a club professional.   And the things‑‑ every shot requires full concentration.   It requires your full attention and you can really look silly out there on just about any hole.  
   
 Q.   When do you have to get back to work?  
DENNIS MILLER:   I've got the National Club Pro next week, and after that I'll be back full force.   I'm sure there will be a lot of work waiting for me on my desk.  
   
 Q.   Talk about that whole experience from qualifying to playing in The Open, how is it for you?  
DENNIS MILLER:   Sure.   The moment we qualified it was‑‑ The Golf Channel decides to kind of broadcast the longest day in golf.   And coincidentally they had one camera in Columbus and it captured my ball hanging on the lip and ultimately going in.   
And from there it's just been a whirlwind.   I can't tell you all the outpouring of support I've received from my family and friends and everyone back in Youngstown.
