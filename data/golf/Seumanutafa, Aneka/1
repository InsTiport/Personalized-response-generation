Q. Just talk us through your round a little bit.
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA:   My round?  I was hitting a lot of fairways today.  That's kind of the key for this golf course.  You get in the rough, it's hard to get out of.  A couple times I was in the rough.  But my home course is the same as this, so I've had a lot of practice with that.  With my mom on the bag, pretty relaxing day today.  To be honest, the first tee shot, that was kind of nerve-racking.  I'm not going to lie.  But after that it was just fine, just me and my mom.
Q. Have you played much this summer given everything?
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA:   No, I only played one tournament before this, it was the North and South Women's.  That's pretty much it.
Q. To be kind of back at this, the premier event of the summer, after not playing as much as usual, just talk us through where you're at in your game.
ANEKA SEUMANUTAFA:   Yeah, I felt good coming into this tournament.  I've been working a lot with my coach, with my swing, because at the North and South Women's I was kind of out of whack, but I've been putting in the work and been practicing every single day for this tournament.  I have the honor to play at home, so yeah.
