 Q. This is your first Senior PGA Championship. Did you do anything special to prepare for it?
 VICTOR TORTORICI: I did try to work a little bit harder back at the club for the last few weeks, but it's the end of the season, so it was hard. But I did my best to get here. It was really interesting because I was an alternate, so, you know, I was not sure if I was even going to get in. 

 Q. It must have been exciting to get the call. When did you get the call?
 VICTOR TORTORICI: I found out Monday, no, Tuesday at five o'clock. 

 Q. Changed your plans then?
 VICTOR TORTORICI: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. 

 Q. What do you think of the course?
 VICTOR TORTORICI: The course is great. The course is great. I wish I played a little better, but the course is great, the course was beautiful, it was right there, I mean if you played well you could play well and some guys did. 

 Q. What did it feel like on the first tee?
 VICTOR TORTORICI: Oh, I was definitely nervous. I certainly had the jitters. But making a four on the 10th hole I was really happy with that. 
 And I did really well on the back nine, I was only 2-over at the turn, but it was bad coming in.
