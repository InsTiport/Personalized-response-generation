 Q.  Seems like you picked up with where you left of last year a little bit.  Do you feel comfortable every time you step on the tee out here?  
KATIE BURNETT: Yeah.  I just kind of feel like I'm at home a little bit with my brother living here.  I have family, and, you know, just come chill the week before.   
The golf course, I mean, we don't play on bermuda a whole lot and I'm from bermuda, so I think I read the greens pretty well out here.  I'm also from the coast at home, so the wind doesn't really bother me.   
Also, you don't really have to hit your tee shots that well out here to have a shot at the greens.  I'm just really comfortable all around out here.   
 Q.  Does that kind of free you up, do you think, to be able to swing without having to worry if the ball is going to end up in a bad position all the time?  
KATIE BURNETT: Yeah, I mean, I would say actually my tee shots today were pretty bad, but every time I had some sort of shot into the green, and I hit my irons really well today, so that -- you know, you don't have to hit it great out here to play well, basically.   
 Q.  Who all do you have here watching today?  Your brother, but is that the big group of people over there with you?  
KATIE BURNETT: Yeah.  So my brother, my sister-in-law, my dad and my step mom, and then two of their friends.   
 Q.  Got you.  So what do you plan on doing to continue this play?  
KATIE BURNETT: I'm going to go work on my tee shots so hopefully I can have a few more balls in the fairway, which will make it a little bit easier to give myself a chance at birdie.   
Other than that, I think everything else in my game is pretty solid.
