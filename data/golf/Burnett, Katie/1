Q. How exciting or settling was it to birdie the first two out of the gate today?
KATIE BURNETT: It was nice.  I hit a couple good shots in there, and I made two really good putts.  I'm staying in housing this week, and my housing lady was right there on the first two holes cheering for me, so it was nice.
Q. Did the rain yesterday kind of really allow you to fire at things today?
KATIE BURNETT: Yeah, the greens were a little softer today.  I figured the scores would be lower, on the lower side, because you could -- you weren't getting much release of the ball, so you could go at them.
Q. Is this one of your best starts of the season?
KATIE BURNETT: I think so, yeah, maybe.
Q. How good does it feel to get off to a bogey-free start on Thursday?
KATIE BURNETT: Good.  I've been struggling the past couple weeks, so I kind of -- after I missed the cut last week, kind of refocused on playing my own game and being an athlete, trying to play free without any doubt or worry about what I'm doing, and it worked well today.
Q. Just talk about your expectations for the U.S. Open next week, going into it.
KATIE BURNETT: With the U.S. Open you don't have too many expectations other than it's going to be difficult, so just trying to get out there and prepare as best you can.  I don't really think you ever necessarily play well at a U.S. Open, you just kind of survive the U.S. Open.  Who can survive it at the end of the week is usually who wins.  You know, it's great this week to come out here and play and try and play free and see how that goes and then see if I can do the same thing next week in tougher conditions.
