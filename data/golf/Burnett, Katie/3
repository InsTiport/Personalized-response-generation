 Q.  Not the celebration ending you wanted...  
KATIE BURNETT: You know, just stayed patient and tried not to focus on what everybody else was doing and focused on my process.   
You know, I don't think I gave it away by any means.  That's something, you know, last year I struggled in the final rounds, especially when I had been playing well.   
So to have played well today was really good for me.   
 Q.  How far down did you have to dig to perform like you did today?  
KATIE BURNETT: I had a lot of things to fall back on.  I had a good finish here a couple years ago.  You don't necessarily need to hit it great.  Like you said, I didn't hit it great really all week, but I still scored.   
Again today I didn't hit it that great but still made some putts coming in.  Could have made a few more, but that's how golf goes.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
KATIE BURNETT: You know, it means everything is heading in the right direction and that my coach and I, during the off-season, and my fitness coach, we were all working in the right direction and making progress basically to play better.   
 Q.  When you think about the round did it feel like 70 would do it?  
KATIE BURNETT: Coming into today knowing the wind wasn't going to blow as bad I knew somebody was doing to shoot 7, 8-under.   
I just tried it basically focus on what I can control, and I can't control what other people are going to shoot.   
Yeah, I don't necessarily feel like I lost the tournament.  I feel like Minjee just won it.  8-under, I mean, that's pretty solid.
