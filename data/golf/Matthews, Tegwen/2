Q.   Not much else going well for you, but what a courageous performance in the last match finishing?
    TEGWEN MATTHEWS:   Hugely courageous, and nothing less than I would expect from Bronte and Annabel quite honestly.

Q.   On 16, she said she fancied the putt, but who on earth fancies a 30‑foot slider; right? 
    TEGWEN MATTHEWS:   Only someone like Bronte.   If she can see it, you know that she's got it, yeah, she can. 
    So yes, that was an awesome putt.   It put the momentum back into our favor and got our tails up, and they played the last hole very well.   Annabel, nice and solid into the center of the green, very good putt. 
    That is a great win.   That is a magnificent win from being 3‑down. 

Q.   Not much else going right for you and you're in a huge hole as you start the afternoon. 
    TEGWEN MATTHEWS:   Yeah, I think it's more than not much going right for us.   Give absolute full credit to the USA team.   They are playing very attacking golf.   They are sticking an awful lot of shots within six‑foot of the pin, and then holing the putts, as well. 
    So there was a lot of good golf out there, a lot of birdies, and as I said ‑‑ my hashtag is #needmorebirdies.
