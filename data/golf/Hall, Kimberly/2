 Q.  Kind of talk about your round.  You had a phenomenal round and you're currently in second, and were it not for Shi Hyun Ahn's hole-in-one, you'd probably be in the lead. 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Well, good for her hole-in-one.  All right. 
 I was just really relaxed, we got some good numbers, and when I had good numbers I went at the flag and just tried to stay patient all day.  Jody is really good at making me feel good about whatever stick I've got in my hand.  It was really fun, really relaxed today. 

 Q.  Who was your caddie today? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Jody Keepers. 

 Q.  It looked like that could have been anything, that you could have been 10, 11. 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  I had a couple of putts that lipped out on the front nine -- well, the back nine, which was our front nine.  I had a couple putts that lipped out, but I birdied 17 and 18 with some close shots.  You know, you give some, get some. 

 Q.  It's just that you were hitting it seems like everything stiff for the longest time, and then just a couple holes -- 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah, a couple holes I was trying to cut one on in there on -- what hole was that? 

 Q.  4? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  4 maybe or 5, I was trying to hit a little cut, and I just double-crossed it.  Actually made a good chip there, but it did not break like I thought it would.  Yeah, I felt like even when I made bogey, I hit the shots I wanted to hit, it just didn't go in. 

 Q.  Do you find yourself a stronger player on some of these tighter golf courses because obviously a 68 or 67 is pretty good out here. 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah, I actually prefer the tighter golf courses because I'm not a long ball hitter, so when the girls can just bomb it all over the place and hit wedges in and I'm still hitting a 7-iron -- I love playing the tighter golf courses.  Sometimes when you just have to work the ball a little bit, you know, I really enjoy those kind of courses. 

 Q.  How well does this course set up for you and where are some highlights, some strengths of yours that the course plays to? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Like I said, I like to work the ball a little bit, and there are several holes where we have to hit 3-woods and 5-woods and stuff off the tee.  I think it's good because it makes you hit a lot of different shots.  We have a lot of different clubs in our hands, anything from hybrid clubs to -- we have a 200-yard par 3, but then we have a couple holes where we're hitting gap wedges in.  So I think it's really fair for everyone. 

 Q.  No. 7, that's where everybody had like a -- 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah, we were all right in there. 

 Q.  You had the longest one at six feet? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah, I was away.  I was at five feet.  I was like, I guess I'll putt first.  Dawn almost dunked it.  That would have been cool. 

 Q.  How close were you on 17 and 18 would you say? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  17 I was about three feet, and 18 about the same, about four feet. 

 Q.  What did you hit in on those, do you remember? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  17 I hit a 6-iron, and 18 I hit a gripped-down rescue club. 

 Q.  How far from? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  What were we, 165 maybe, into a little breeze. 

 Q.  And on 17? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  151, I think. 

 Q.  And then on that one where you hit one to about a foot, No. 3, was that -- 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Par 5? 

 Q.  Yeah. 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  I hit a gripped down 9-iron. 

 Q.  To how close? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  It was like tap-in. 

 Q.  Eight inches, ten inches? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah. 

 Q.  What about the birdie on No. 10? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  The first hole? 

 Q.  Yeah. 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  I hit a good shot in there.  I was probably about eight feet right of the hole, made a good putt. 

 Q.  What did you hit in? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  A sand wedge. 

 Q.  And you said you had a 6-iron from 151 to three feet on 17? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yes. 

 Q.  And the gripped rescue to four feet on 18.  No. 2? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  No. 2?  Oh, I hit a pitching wedge from 103, pitching wedge, and I hit it to about 10, 12 feet. 

 Q.  And the bogey on 4? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Three putts. 

 Q.  From how far? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  About 50 feet. 

 Q.  What did you use off the tee? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  6-iron. 

 Q.  And then 5? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  I had 164 to the hole, and I hit a 5-iron left of the green. 

 Q.  And you chipped on? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  And I chipped on and missed my putt. 

 Q.  How far was it? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  It was about a five-footer. 

 Q.  And then your birdie on 7? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  I hit a 9-iron to about four feet. 

 Q.  Tell me about the final stretch there for you.  Last I heard you were kind of heating it up there coming down the stretch. 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  I was.  I had gone birdie-birdie on 2 and 3 after we made the turn, and then bogeyed 4 and bogeyed 5.  Just, you know, I hit good shots, but my one on 4 kind of rolled out way left, and then I pulled the one on 5 a little bit. 
 But then I've been hitting the ball really good all day so just tried not to let it rattle me and tried to do some good things coming in, and I had a couple birdie chances coming in, and I made a couple. 

 Q.  A great score, 7-under obviously, but how good is that just today with the conditions and everything? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  This morning was tough.  It was cold and windy.  It's a little warmer now and I don't think the wind is quite as strong.  But, I mean, I think the scores are going to be good today.  There's a lot of really accessible pins and the greens are soft enough where you can really go at them. 

 Q.  So you were a rookie last year? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yes. 

 Q.  And you went back to Q-school? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yes, I went back to Q-school this last fall. 

 Q.  And now you have full status? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yes. 

 Q.  That's got to be easier? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah, it's a lot better.  Actually Q-school did a lot for my confidence because I played well there and really relaxed, and it was good to show myself that I could do it.  It felt easy this time around instead of trying to struggle for it. 
 And it makes the planning the schedule a lot easier (laughing), being able to know that you're in the tournament instead of Monday qualifying.  I definitely know what that's like. 

 Q.  How many Monday qualifiers did you have to do last year? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Well, I made it into 11 tournaments, but I tried to Monday qualify for all the rest. 

 Q.  All of them? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah, so however many left on the schedule there were. 

 Q.  Your number of tournaments minus 11? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah, I think there's probably like 23 events or something like that, so I must have tried to Monday like 13 times or something. 

 Q.  That Monday qualifying is like -- 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  It's tough.  It's such a crapshoot sometimes because you can't -- I like to play like really steady kind of golf, you know, and there you've got to really kind of go after it. 

 Q.  Because you've got to get hot one round or -- 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yep, usually. 

 Q.  Sometimes two but mostly one? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  All of them are one.  They're all one day, one round, two spots, always. 

 Q.  And you usually have 40 people out for two spots? 
 KIMBERLY HALL:  Yeah, and this week we had 60 something.
