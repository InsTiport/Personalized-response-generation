  Q. Great playing today.  How would you sum up your round 2 in this year's U.S. Women's Open?
 MINYOUNG2 LEE:  My initial shots weren't that great, but I wasn't able to get as close to the green as I would like.  But overall not many mistakes, and I was able to make par.
 Q. Looking ahead to the final 36 holes, how excited are you to make the cut and how excited are you for the weekend?
 MINYOUNG2 LEE:  My initial goal when I got here was to make the cut, and now since I've achieved that goal, now it's making it to the top 10.  My strategy before was more laid back and more defense.  Now it's more aggressive tactic from here on out.
 Q. You played two different golf courses the first two days.  How different were these two golf courses, and what does it mean to now be able to focus your attention on solely Cypress for the weekend?
 MINYOUNG2 LEE:  This is the first ever experience.  It was definitely double the workload because it was two different courses, but now since it's narrowed down to one, I think it will be a lighter workload from here on out.
