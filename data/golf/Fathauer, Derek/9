 Q.   Overall thoughts on your round today?   Nice round, a lot of the people in the afternoon had some toughness with the firmness of the golf course.   Talk a little about how it played this afternoon?  
DEREK FATHAUER:   It was still firm.   Maybe the wind died down a little bit.   But it was still windy but greens were firm.   I just made some good saves, those 3‑, 4‑footers that you've got to make out here.  
   
 Q.   What's the important part of your game around this track the way it's playing right now?  
DEREK FATHAUER:   Hitting it in the fairway.   That's it.   Making putts.   
   
 Q.   What's your strategy going into the next few days?   
DEREK FATHAUER:   Just keep doing what I'm doing.   Stick to the game plan.
