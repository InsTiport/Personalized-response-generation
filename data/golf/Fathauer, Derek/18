   CRAIG SMITH:  Derek Fathauer, thanks and congratulations.  Looks like you were in a little bit of a hurry out there.  Your first match was easy and your second match was also pretty one sided.  Are you playing that well?  Go through some of the stuff. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I'm playing pretty solid but this morning I was pretty much given a lot of holes.  He wasn't hitting it very well.  And this afternoon just about the same thing.  He was hitting it a little better, but I just played pretty solid. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  You beat the College Player of the Year and the medalist here this week and I guess maybe it is your turn. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Maybe.  Which one was the College Player of the Year? 
 CRAIG SMITH:  That would be Kirk. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Who? 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Kirk. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Oh. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  We'll go through some of your pluses and minuses.  What did you do so well to get done so quickly. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I made a few putts and just played solid. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  We can't let you get away with that. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Didn't make a lot of mistakes.  Hit the fairway, hit the greens and made some putts. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Okay.  When you were coming in it was, my gosh, it's Derek, and they're twins and, you know, you're stepping out of the twins category now you're making a mark for your self. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  My brother's still pretty good.  He just had a bad week.  So. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Questions? 

 Q.  Can you talk about how you felt about your game coming into the week?  Did you anticipate being able to move along into match play and play as well as you've been doing? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Yeah, I expected to do good.  I played pretty well at the Public Links this year and I played the Scratch Players Tournament earlier this week and I didn't play very well, but I played pretty solid. 
 So I expected good things. 

 Q.  How much did the experience that you had at the Public Links getting to the semi-finals, how much has that helped you being here and getting into match play here and then in your matches, because you don't play match play that much? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I think it helped a lot.  Just you stay patient and just hang in there and I had a lot of long days at the Public Links, so this today seemed pretty short. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Does it help to have not been behind, would you have been a little less confident if you were having to comeback or are you playing so well that you're trusting everything you're doing. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I'm trusting what I'm doing. 
 I birdied the first hole both rounds today and went 1-up.  And just played solid.  Nothing special.  And just let them make the mistakes. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  That first hole, what are you doing on the first hole?  Driver or? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I'm hitting driver. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  And then? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  First round I hit the tree and hit it like sixty yards, so I'm kind of nervous with the driver on the first hole, but there's nothing else to hit. 

 Q.  This last year you had such a great year college-wise, how are you different golfer perhaps than you were say a year ago now? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I think just the experience and just being there.  I played in big tournaments and it just helps to have been there before. 

 Q.  Just feel more comfortable? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Yeah, a lot more comfortable.  Not up here, though. 
 (Laughter.). 
 CRAIG SMITH:  This is the toughest part of the week, isn't it. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Yeah. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Are you thinking ahead yet or can't you do that? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  No, I learned you can't. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  How did you learn that?  The hard way? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Yeah the hard way. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Where?  Public Links. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Yeah.  Semi-finals.  And. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Stretch it out a little. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I think I was 2-up with like four to go or something is and blew it. 
 I mean, I hit a couple bad shots, but I was also thinking about getting to the finals, win the tournament, play in the Masters.  But you just can't think about that this week. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  What are you doing to not do that?  Do you catch yourself at times? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  No.  I got a good caddie to talk to.  And keep my mind off that kind of stuff.  We don't usually talk about golf when we're out there. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  What do you talk about? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Anything. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  But haircuts, right? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  No haircuts. 
 (Laughter.) 
 CRAIG SMITH:  So when, if -- I mean, that was a note you put in your business, at least I get, they're going to recognize me anyway. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I guess so.  Everyone has this week. 

 Q.  Has your brother left or is he still here? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  He's right behind you.  So he's still here. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Do you want to ask any hard questions? 
 (Laughter.) 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Who is the better golfer?  You or your brother? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  This week I guess it's me. 
 (Laughter.)  We're about the same, I would say. 

 Q.  I couldn't see you on the other side of the green, but what was the lie like on your chip in there? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  On the par-3? 

 Q.  Yeah. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  It wasn't very good.  I just kind of hit at it and tried to just pop it up and get it on the green.  And it went in. 

 Q.  Was Jason's lie actually better? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  I didn't really look at it.  But he was further up the hill, so it seemed like a little easier shot. 

 Q.  What did you hit into that hole? 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  A 6-iron. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Did you find it a little bit different today that they moved some of the tees up and sort of challenged you to go for some of the holes. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Like 7? 
 CRAIG SMITH:  7.  Yeah. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  A little bit.  I was still going for it from the back tee.  And it didn't seem any different than the first round.  I just hadn't seen a couple of the, that par 3 hole 1, I think it is.  And 14, I hadn't seen those holes this morning.  But it was the same as this morning.  A little windier. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  We'll let you go do the easy stuff.  Winning.  This is harder for you, isn't it. 
 DEREK FATHAUER:  Yeah.  You guys should know that.
