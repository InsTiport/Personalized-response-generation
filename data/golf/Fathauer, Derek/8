Q. Seven birdies, you had 4 in a row there.  What was going right with you?
DEREK FATHAUER: The putter.  I feel like I made everything.  I don't know.  I'd like to see my putting stats for today but felt like everything went in, at least the last 9, 10 holes or so.
Q. You had a missed cut last week so coming in over here --
DEREK FATHAUER: I played good last week the first two days.  There was one hole that got me.  I made a quad and a double on the same hole for two days.  I played that hole 6-over and I shot 6-over so I would have made the cut if I could have just parred the one hole but --
Q. It's your first time here so on this course, how do you feel it suits your game?
DEREK FATHAUER: I started to drive it a little better and these greens are so pure that I'd like to think I'm a pretty good putter so I mean get it on the green and see what I can do.  Today was pretty special on the greens.  That's why I am where I am right now.
Q. Got a stacked leaderboard, five shots behind Jason Day but going into the weekend, some weather coming tomorrow.  What will be the game plan for Saturday?
DEREK FATHAUER: Just keep doing what I'm doing, not try to force anything, maybe just -- the greens are going to get firmer and the course is going to get tougher.  Maybe play a little more conservative but I'm not sure, it's my first time here, kind of go with the flow, I guess.
Q. You're making it look easy out there.  Thank you.
DEREK FATHAUER: Thanks a lot.
