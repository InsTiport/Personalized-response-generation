 Q.  32 points through three rounds, a really good finish those last six holes.  Just get some comments on your round?  
DEREK FATHAUER: Yeah, actually, I don't know, I just kind of held it together on the last few holes, but definitely wasn't my best golf.  Sort of didn't really have a good feel of where the ball was going, just sort of hit it in the right spots, and I got lucky on that par-5 to hit it so close and have pretty much a tap-in eagle.  But that's the way it goes, I guess.  You get rewarded for taking some risks, and that was a risky shot I hit on that hole, and I was just trying to get it near the green and ended up like, whatever, two feet away.   
 Q.  Which club did you hit in?  
DEREK FATHAUER: I hit 4-iron.   
 Q.  Possibly in the last group tomorrow; will that change your mindset?  
DEREK FATHAUER: No, they've got the split tees and threesomes.  It's just everybody is going to be teeing off at the same time, which is kind of good for -- I mean, you'd rather tee off at the same time than way late in the afternoon, so it might work in my favor a little bit.   
 Q.  You said risky; why was the shot on 18 risky?  
DEREK FATHAUER: Oh, it wasn't 18, it was 13.   
 Q.  That was the eagle?  
DEREK FATHAUER: Yeah, it was in the rough, and I had to hook it around the trees.  I didn't really have any other shot to hit, and just ended up perfect.
