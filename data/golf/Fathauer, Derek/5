Q. 67 today, was that what you were looking for, even to try to go a little deeper to put pressure on the leaders?
DEREK FATHAUER: I thought I did pretty good.  Didn't play the back nine as well as I should have but I played a solid round of golf and pretty pleased with it.
Q. Running by three right now, good result at the end for you?
DEREK FATHAUER: Yeah, good start to the season.  Finished 15th last week and third this week, so good start.
Q. Was there a thought that you could put some pressure on the leaders early on, knowing that the lead was four to start off?
DEREK FATHAUER: I didn't see it.  I didn't see the leaderboard until the back nine and Justin was playing pretty good.  So just kind of stuck with what I was doing.  Unfortunately made a bogey on the par 3 and didn't make any kind of birdies.  But all in all, solid day.
Q. So a lot to take forward to next week and the rest of the season?
DEREK FATHAUER: Yeah, yeah, for sure.  I'll learn a lot from this this week.  It will be a good year for me.  Pretty excited.
