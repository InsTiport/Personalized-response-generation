Q. I know you had a couple birdies, four or five bogeys on the back nine coming back in, can you describe a little bit about how the round went today?
DEREK FATHAUER: What would you say, TJ?
(Laughter.)  Some ups and downs.
Q. But 8-under, you're in contention for tomorrow.  How do you feel about your chances?
DEREK FATHAUER: You said we're 8 back or something?  Yeah, I guess I just try to go make a check, you know, so.
Q. Do you think the delays in terms of the weather have had any impact at all in terms of play today or anything?
DEREK FATHAUER: Not today.  I don't think there was any delays today.
Q. But just during the course of the week.
DEREK FATHAUER: Everybody had to do it, so.
