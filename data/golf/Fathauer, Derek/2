Q. 14 points today; excellent round.  Just get some comments.
DEREK FATHAUER: Kind of bogeyed one of -- I hit great shots on the first few holes and lost a point after three holes.  Hit the pin on the par-3 for a hole-in-one and ended up making bogey.  I didn't think the day was going to turn around like that, and then after the delay, came out and missed a real short putt and then managed to birdie the last, so it was kind of up-and-down day.  It was really good in the middle, but the end of the round -- or the start and the end were pretty dicey.
Q. You finished seventh here two years ago, obviously a format that you seem to enjoy.
DEREK FATHAUER: Yeah, I think I make quite a few birdies, but I usually make quite a few bogeys, too, so that works in my favor here.  Hopefully I'll keep those bogeys off the card.
Q. Currently inside the Top 125.  Comment a little bit about your goals here with just a couple weeks left in the season.
DEREK FATHAUER: I've had a strange year.  Got off to a really good start and then just been lost kind of the whole year.  Just want to finish it off here, and not really too concerned where I end up.  I just want to be safe at the end of the year and then go rethink everything and come back and be ready for the fall.
Q. Thoughts going into the weekend right up there?
DEREK FATHAUER: Whatever, try to get some of my money back from the casino.
