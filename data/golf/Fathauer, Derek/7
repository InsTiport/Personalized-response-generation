 Q.  Well, Derek, good start to the week.  I would say you go off to a bogey-free round, lot of birdies.  
 Got to feel good about that.   
DEREK FATHAUER: Got off to a good start today.  Say last four, five weeks I got off to slow starts, 3 and 4-over par on the front-9 the last couple of weeks.  It was nice to be under par early and just kind of improve that.   
 Q.  Did you do anything different to maybe change the routine a little bit, to jump start it a little bit sooner?  
DEREK FATHAUER: Played a little more aggressive today.  Not off the tee.  Hitting more at the pins instead of playing conservative.  I kind of -- I'm safe into the 1st Round of the FedEx and I just needed to be aggressive and shot up the rankings.   
 Q.  Last I looked you hit 14 of 17 greens.  I didn't see what you finished up at 18.  You threw it at some pins today and it off.  
DEREK FATHAUER: Yeah.  These greens are so good here.  You just got to get it on the greens and make it from anywhere.   
 Q.  Good start to the week.  Good luck tomorrow.  
DEREK FATHAUER: Thank you.
