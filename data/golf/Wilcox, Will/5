Q.   Well played out there.   Especially that up‑and‑down there at 18 for a 67.   Pretty good here at Spyglass?
WILL WILCOX:   Yeah, this is one of the courses that I was looking at the start of the week that you got to hang on.   The fairways were really narrow.   But the one on 18th wind switched on me and I hit a gap wedge almost 150 yards.   That was the only one I messed up all day.

Q.   Back to back 5‑under par rounds.   What's been the key for you this week?
WILL WILCOX:   I got a nice swing tip from Rick Smith at the start of the week and my putting has gotten a lot better.   I've been, I don't even think I was in the top 180 last year, so I'm rolling it a lot better.   I think I had around 30 both rounds.   Which for me is huge.

Q.   You're playing competitor Scott Pinckney not as successful as you were going 11‑over.   How tough is that to stay focused when he's playing bad?
WILL WILCOX:   Oh, he's a world‑class player.   I have known him for a while and I mean we were just doing our own thing.   It's whatever.   You don't even really notice it.   I was just hanging out and he was really respectful and everything the whole time, so we were just hanging out.
