 Q.   Just get some comments on the day if we can.   
WILL WILCOX:   Yeah.   I didn't hit it my best, but I still finished top 10.   I mean, it's huge for me personally, professionally, and everything is great.   I'm as happy as I can be.   I made a bunch of clutch par putts on the back nine.   Shoot, pretty proud; 1â€‘over isn't that bad.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the experience and what you'll take from this.   
WILL WILCOX:   More money than I've ever gotten in a check.   Yeah, top 10 on the PGA TOUR my third event.   That's kind of special, I think.   I don't know, a milestone for me in my career.   I was amazing getting to play with some Georgia boys, buddies, and yeah, it was a dream come true out there.
