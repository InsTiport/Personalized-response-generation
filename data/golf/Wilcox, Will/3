Q. Kind of assess your round.
WILL WILCOX: I can't of believe I shot 3-under.  I deserved 80.  I haven't been in many final groups and I was nervous and hit a lot of bad shots.  Made some good putts to keep it within striking distance.
I guess I'm going to need to figure out how to hit the ball again tomorrow.  Today was a big struggle, so I guess there is something to be said for getting it in at 3-under.
Q. In a weird way does that give you some confidence?  As much as you think you struggled you're sticking right there with the leaders.
WILL WILCOX: Yeah, it was weird.  All day it was like, I still can't believe I'm in double digits.  It was just a weird, weird day.  Just couldn't get it.  Missed a lot of fairways and greens.  I normally do both of those well.
Hopefully tomorrow I can figure it out.
Q. Couple shots that kind of typify the round maybe...
WILL WILCOX: The struggle.
Q. Yeah, the struggle, breaks that didn't go your way.
WILL WILCOX: No, absolutely not.  I got some good breaks.  Every time I missed green the lie was decent.  You know, I just hope I can figure it out.
I'm a little tired, so just going to hit balls in the morning.  Hopefully I can just find the swing that I had in the first two days, because it was the easiest thing I've ever done.
Today was so difficult.
Q. Sightlines have anything to do with it?
WILL WILCOX: No, no.  I enjoy everything about this golf course.  I just hit some bad shots.  Just was weird.
