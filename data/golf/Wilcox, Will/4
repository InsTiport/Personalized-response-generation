Q. First nine a little up and down, but it looked like the second nine got it going there.WILL WILCOX: Yeah, yeah, settled in.  I was really nervous.  I call it a Friday Freak Out.  I'm always nervous at the start of Friday. Had a tough second hole today.  You know, kind of settled into it and figured out my swing.  I made a couple really bad swings, but I think we're good now.Q. Even with the couple mishaps there, tee to green liked like you played pretty solid.WILL WILCOX: Yeah, yeah, on the back I started figuring it out.  I know I am hitting it well, so when I hit that really bad one off 11, you know, kind of sent me into a little spell.  But I figured it out.  Fortunately I get to play the weekend.Q. Going into the weekend, what's the plan moving forward now?  Just two strokes off the lead now.WILL WILCOX: Do the same thing.  I really like this golf course.  With me it's usually putting.  Missed the last two cuts by one, so I am just relieved to make a cut.  See what happens. You know, I'm in one of the last couple groups, so it's pretty cool.  Be the second time I'm in the last few pairings on Saturday.  Just a learning experience.
