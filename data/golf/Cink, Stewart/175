Q.  Some thoughts on your first match.
STEWART CINK:  Both of our styles, even though no one won, no one lost, and it had the ingredients of a great match all the way.
Q.  How does it feel playing out there with all that excitement?
STEWART CINK:  It's exciting.  They are definitely supporting their team, and should be.  And I think probably the best sound for our team is going to be no sound at all.  I noticed when we do something good, there's not a whole lot of noise going on out there, and it's nice to see a lot of people quiet.
Q.  Can you see any American supporters out there for you?
STEWART CINK:  Yeah, there's plenty of support for us, but they are way outnumbered by the Europeans for geographic reasons.

We'll fight hard and it's still really early in these things.  A one point difference after the first session, it's almost minuscule.
