JOAN V.T. ALEXANDER:  Thank you for joining us. 
STEWART CINK: Yeah.  Overall it was a pretty average day except for numbers 1 through 4 where I piled up 8 points.  But I was pretty pleased.  I had a lot of chances for some birdies and I really didn't get myself into too much trouble. 
JOAN V.T. ALEXANDER:  Questions. 
Q.   Talk about the conditions.
STEWART CINK: There's a lot of swirling wind.  Coming from sea level we have a tough time judging the distance here.  You have to -- it's not just a straight 10% like everyone says.  You tee off at 7:54 like I did today in the morning and it's not going 10%.  Then sometimes when it's hot in the afternoon it goes more than that.  You have to really get a feel for the temperature and the way the ball goes through the air.  Then you add the wind in there.  The wind affects the ball totally different than anywhere else.  You hit a shot straight into the wind, the ball just sails straight through because it's so thin.  So yo have to really guess and hitting your shot the right distance is challenging when it's blowing. 

Q.   Certain holes -- No. 7 for a little while, seemed like nobody was getting  close there.  Certain holes that it was really bothersome?
STEWART CINK: On the 7th hole no one was getting close because that was the only hard green all day.  There's  three or four greens that were really firm in the early days this week and I don't know if they watered them, or I don't know what happened, but the firm greens suddenly became soft, and until you got to 7 and then you could hear the ball laying on the green all the way from the tee on 7.  So that probably had something to do with that.  By the time we got around to 7 the wind started to lay down some.  It was really blowing hard for us on the back nine, the opening nine. 

Q.   Did you have kind of a point total in mind when you started the first round here?
STEWART CINK: No.  I never do that.  That would be like trying to say, well, I want to go out here today and shoot 68.  You don't ever do that.  You just keep on trying to press forward as much as you can.  When birdies are worth twice as much as bogeys cost you, you have just have to keep on going.  Pars really even though they are zero points in effect they cost you something.

Q.   You said the wind affects the ball differently here. 
STEWART CINK: The ball goes straight through the wind.  Even if it's straight in your face, it just goes right through the wind.  It's really, it's strange standing up over a shot and have 180 yards straight into the wind and know you can hit a 7-iron and get it there.  Sea level is a 4-iron.   Because the air is so thin it just doesn't affect the ball so much.  Also crosswind doesn't curve it as much.  You have to resist the temptation to add a lot of club for wind. 

Q.   Can you talk about your group - I think you kind of struggled on the No. 8 hole.  Minus 7 for the three of you, like a train wreck....
STEWART CINK: Yeah, sort of a train wreck.  I think it was coincidental.  Just that we all happened to mess up the hole at the same time.  Difficult pin placement but easy hole.  Most players would be able to reach it in 2 if they hit the fairway.  Phil hit it in the gunch, and I don't know if he missed, but he took two shots to get it back into the rough.  And I laid my ball up right behind the tree there and really surprised me, I didn't really think I was in trouble.  Then I fatted my third shot trying to go over the tree.  And Notah was right in front of the green in 2.  He hit it over, hit it over again and before I knew it, he was in his pocket and I was the only one playing.  I hit first off No. 9 after making a bogey there. 

Q.   I remember a couple of years ago you told us you played as a kid -- you were living in Nebraska at the time or what was that story?
STEWART CINK: Close.  My dad grew up in Nebraska.  I have never played there.  But no, I have always enjoyed playing altitudes.  I won the BUY.COM, (inaudible) used to be called the Nike Tour.  I won that (inaudible) I won the Mexican Open twice, that's 9000 feet, and I just always have been very comfortable playing when you have to figure out the yardages.  I don't know why that is, but I played some golf in Vail before.  I just always enjoyed it.   I like the mountains.  I love just being in the mountains and my dad grew up in Nebraska and moved to (inaudible) (the mountains) when he was young, so it's in my blood.  I couldn't get it out of it even if I wanted to. 
JOAN V.T. ALEXANDER:  But you have done well.
STEWART CINK: I have had some success.  I never really played great in this tournament.  I have had a couple good early rounds but never really finished really high.  But Riverdale Dunes I won there and Mexico City, two pretty good wins there.  I got a pretty high batting average in high elevation.
