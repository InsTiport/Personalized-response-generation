 Q.  Four straight Ryder Cup or Presidents Cups opponents moves you into the semifinals.  What's been the key to your play? 
 STEWART CINK:  I think overall my putting has been what's kept me in and on top of most of these matches the whole way.  I've been a little inconsistent.  I've had some really good moments driving the ball and some really weak moments like yesterday. 
 But my putting has been solid all week.  We came through today.  I won the stretch of holes I've been winning in the middle of the round. 

 Q.  You've got to love this match play right here, because you let him get a little bit close, but put the hammer down when you had to? 
 STEWART CINK:  That's what it's all about.  I played pretty solidly today.  I drove the ball probably as well as I have in a long time today.  I hit a lot of good irons and made some putts.  It's just a good recipe for match play.  It's hard to compete against someone when they're doing that. 

 Q.  Was it a little bit different starting this morning with the overcast sky?  It seemed like the ball wasn't going quite as far.  And then when the sun came out everything dried up? 
 STEWART CINK:  Yeah, you had to adjust a little bit on your yardage.  Really that's the only difference it made.  It wasn't real windy or anything.  But there was definitely a little more club taken early in the round. 

 Q.  You've got a bit of time between the next match.  Are you going to eat and relax or grab something and swing some clubs? 
 STEWART CINK:  I've got 50 minutes, so I don't exactly have a lot of time.  I'll probably hit a few balls before I go, but I'm not going to go through my full warmup. 
 First things first, though, I've got to eat something.
