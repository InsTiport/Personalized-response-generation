Q. You came in this week at 81st, knowing that you had to have a great week.  How satisfying is to now be projected at 57 and on to BMW?
STEWART CINK: It's really satisfying.  This tournament on its own is a big deal to me, and I wanted to play well here for a lot of reasons, but certainly that's one of the reasons.  And to get that part of the goal accomplished -- you know, I've been on the other side of that result a lot of times, too, and it doesn't feel good at all.  It does feel really good to putt that together.
Q. Given the situation with your family, with Lisa, of course, that's got to be doubly special.
STEWART CINK: Yeah, we were just talking about it for a moment this morning.  Just talking about we've been through a lot this last year, year and a half.  I've been able to sort of rely on golf and escape to golf, and golf's been great to me for a long time.  It's not failed me this last bit of time, and it's just -- I'm honored and privileged to be able to play this game and compete at this level against these young people.  It's a lot of fun to compete out there, and when you have a good week like this -- no, I'm not going to win, but still, it's a pretty solid week and it's something that I can build on.
