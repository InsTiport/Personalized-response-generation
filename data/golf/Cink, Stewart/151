 Q.  You hit the chip shots. 
 ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, I put him in some difficult positions off the tee and that was unfortunate and he put me in good positions to get up-and-down and that's all we were trying to do.  I leaned on him a lot and fortunately we were able to come through. 

 Q.  The concession at 18, were you expecting to putt? 
 STEWART CINK:  You always expect to have to putt, and especially to win the match, but I didn't think it was right to make them, you know, have to putt out theirs, and that was a good show of sportsmanship from both sides. 

 Q.  You were just telling each other, you can't believe you won, is that right? 
 STEWART CINK:  Our record in team match play or team golf period has not exactly been stellar.  That's the first good thing good we've done I think in history.  We're real pleased to get one on the good side. 

 Q.  Zach, I followed you on Saturday at East Lake, you get up-and-down out of the bunker for par.  I followed you Sunday at East Lake, you're up-and-down out of the 18th for par.  Now that I've seen you after THE TOUR Championship -- 
 ZACH JOHNSON:  Pretty straightforward shot fortunately, would have liked to have had a birdie opportunity but my tee shot went a little wayward.  I feel fortunate, Rory and Trevor played well and we're just happy we did something good for the team.
