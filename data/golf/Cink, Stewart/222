STEWART CINK:  Today was a pretty solid day, not exceptional, but it was the kind of round that you need when you're in contention to move you up a little bit and at least keep you within reach of the leaders.
Q.  It'll be a tight race tomorrow.
STEWART CINK:  It'll be a tight race because the golf course is yielding lots of birdies.  The greens are soft and smooth, and when you have conditions like these, with these guys, the players are so good, they'll just eat up any course.

It should be a really nice horse race tomorrow.
Q.  A lot of players have said that they understand that everybody is playing for 2nd tomorrow.  Do you go in with that mindset or do you go in with the mindset that Jose can be caught?
STEWART CINK:  I came back from nine shots to win a tournament this year, so I won't go in with the mindset of trying to finish 2nd at all.  Weird things happen to guys that are leading the tournament on Saturday night.  I hate to put it on anybody, but it happens.

Out here when you're in the race for 2nd, you know, you don't want to finish 2nd.  If you try hard and you push, you never know what's going to happen with the leader.
