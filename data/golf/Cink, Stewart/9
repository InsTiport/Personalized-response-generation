 Q.  Just tell us about your day and why it was so good.  
STEWART CINK: It didn't feel all that great, to be honest.  I took advantage of a few holes early.  I got under par pretty early, and it was a somewhat of a lackluster day from about the fourth hole, which was 13, all the way around to the clubhouse.  I only made one more birdie, only made one more bogey, couple of good saves, and I left a few out there.   
I think the scores could be pretty low.  I think it's no surprise with the softness of the greens that the scores could be fairly low, but you need to play from the fairway.   
It's challenging to hit the ball from close to the hole and make birdies from the rough here.   
 Q.  10th hole is taking names today, hardly any birdies.  How did you play at that hole, and why is that hole playing tough today?  
STEWART CINK: It's playing tough because it's a 500-plus yard par 4 and it's designed to be a par 5 green.  That's why it's playing tough.  It's going to play tough every day.  It's imperative to hit the fairway.  I hit a great drive off there.  That was my first drive of the day, and just smoked it down there and still had 209 in, which is almost unheard of.   
It's just a shallow green back to front.  It's not very wide.  So your distance control has to be perfect, and therefore you just need to be coming in from the fairway from that kind of distance.   
 Q.  It wasn't tough to make because of the pin position.  It's just tough because it's a big drive.  
STEWART CINK: It's tough because it's a tough hole.  And today's pin was tough too, but there won't be any easy pins on that hole.  Every pin will be punishing.  You just have to hit two really good shots from the tee and the fairway and give yourself a chance to make birdie.  That's really the way to play the hole.  It's just the kind of hole you want to get through.   
 Q.  You went and practiced putting.  Was there something a little amiss?  
STEWART CINK: Not really anything majorly amiss.  I always like to close the round out with a little bit of putting kind of like a buffer to sort of transition the mind from competing to relaxing.  I found that, when it's really hot, it's not really advantageous to go and hit a whole bunch of balls, not at my age.  I've done that for 22 years, and I never really learned one thing, except not to do it.   
So I like to putt a little bit.  If the short game area was a little closer, I'd probably go out and hit a few bunker shots or something like that because I didn't hit any today.   
 Q.  Overall good start?  
STEWART CINK: Yeah, it feels pretty good.  It wasn't that great of a round today.  I managed myself around pretty well and made some good par saves.  It could be better.  This course is going to really reward ball hitting.  A lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  You're going to have realistic looks at birdies on a lot of holes.  You can score from this course if you play from the fairway.   
 Q.  Bad weather coming into this event.  How many practice rounds did you play?  Did you get out there much?  
STEWART CINK: I played the front nine on Monday, and that's it.  I played the back nine -- two or three holes on the back nine with all the rain on Tuesday, and I played the entire back nine yesterday.  So I played basically the course one time.  I played in '08.  I don't remember much about '08, but I did play then, for what it's worth.
