 Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  Well it's playing a lot more through the air than you normally you play it on the ground here.  Today you're not getting much roll.  You're just hitting it in the air, a lot of guys are hitting a lot of drivers.  I didn't hit that many.  I hit a lot of 3-woods.  And the greens are soft.  It's just this course does not really show much of its teeth.

Q.  Do you prefer that to what you've seen here in the (inaudible)?
STEWART CINK:   I would much rather play hard and fast here.  I love the course no matter what, but it definitely identifies who is the best player with the wind and the heat and the hard fairways. 

Q.  And so given the conditions, are you pleased with where you stand at this?
STEWART CINK:  Yeah, because this morning the scoring wasn't all that low.  I was surprised I thought someone would shoot 7- or 8-under.  But to be under par and have a chance now I am playing well.

Q.  Do you think we'll see a completely different golf course tomorrow?
STEWART CINK:  You might see a little different wind.  It's too wet to dry out that fast.  But maybe Saturday though.
