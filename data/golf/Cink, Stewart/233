Q.  7-under 65 today, thanks for joining us.  Fourth top finish in your last (inaudible) starts and you've already matched last year, and it's only the end of April, I'd say you're off to a pretty good start.  You must must be happy with the way you're playing.
STEWART CINK:  I am happy.

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  I'd like to end up in the winner's circle, but I'll be patient, I'm not going to press.  I'm having a good time playing right now, and a lot more fun on the golf course and a lot more peace of mind than I was having last year or the year before (inaudible).

Q.  Only one bogey, eight birdies today, I'd say you had a good time today?
STEWART CINK:  I did have a great time today.  I had a good group.  I played with my good buddy, Michael Clark and the Ryder Cup captain, Curtis, so (inaudible) lifetime during the round.  It was fun.  You get to talk in between your shots and it keeps your mind off it and keeps you from getting all wrapped up.

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  Yes, the morning rounds here are fairly easy if you hit the ball well.  The course plays very short now, this time of the year (inaudible) the course dries out and it gets hot.  Not that rough, really.  If you hit the ball in the right area, you'll have probably a good chance to birdie.

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  Well, yeah, I've worked pretty hard on it, actually.  (Inaudible)  I just really learned to deny that and not be so afraid of making mistakes.  That's what was really holding me back last year, I think, and from now on I feel like you have to allow yourself to make mistakes.

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  (Inaudible) I didn't really  -- I played very quickly all the way through, almost had a fairway, when I did that I was 10 feet off, I gave up a lot of birdie opportunities on both nines.  (Inaudible) for every hole.  We're going to have to continue to give yourself opportunities because it's really hard around the course (inaudible).

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  That's one reason you practice hard because you know you're going to have a shot if you play aggressive (inaudible) or that lagging behind the others, then I might feel different, but that's the reason you go to the practice range and chipping green and practice green so you're ready when you're faced with that type of shot.

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  Not that difficult of course today.  A lot of talent out here, and the weather is favorable, and the greens are very slow this year, they are actually (inaudible).  They are not terribly hard, but they have to be soft in the morning.  In the afternoon they will be hard. 

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  I would expect the course to stand up a little bit and tomorrow they will come back down and tomorrow afternoon, they will drift back up again.  They always do that Thursday and Friday, it doesn't matter where you play.

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  Same thing they've been doing.  (Inaudible) the thing is that this grass, the greens, if they let them dry out too much the greens would die.  They have to be careful of that.

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  I bogeyed number 1, my fifth hole, I played the back first, and I made bogey, and I was in the middle of the fairway with the sand wedge to the green, and I felt like I was  -- (inaudible) felt like I'm playing a lot better than 2-under par for ten holes in this course, so from there on out I felt like I really  -- i don't know if something clicked.  Nothing changed, my swing or putting stroke or attitude or whatever, but that might have been a point where a year ago I might have pressed a little and started trying to create birdies or eagles, but with my attitude as good as it is, I just let it happen, five birdies in the next eight holes.

Q. (Inaudible).
STEWART CINK:  12, that's an easy hole today.  I hit a nine-iron.  15, I hit a driver down the fairway, 4-iron to the green, hit the bunker, made a pretty good bunker shot, about 3 feet.  16, difficult hole there, I hit the fairway 5-iron about 30 feet, then I played number 1, hit the green with a sand wedge, up and down (inaudible).  2, I (inaudible) 30 feet, 2-putted.  (Inaudible) 4, I hit a wedge about 5 feet; 6, I hit the fairway, laid up, hit a sand wedge 5 feet; and 9 I hit a 9-iron.

Q.  Thank you.
