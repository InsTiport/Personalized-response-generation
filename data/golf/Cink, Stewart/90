   STEWART CINK: It's great for golf. I don't know if it's great for me or not because I'll be 43 and I might be over the hill by then. But it's exciting. I think that when a sport gains Olympic status, it gets a lot more attention, and national sports institutes tend to pay a lot more attention, so it will only do good for the game of golf.   
  
  Q. As far as when you were growing up watching the Olympics, what would it have meant to you to be a part of a sport that's part of the Olympic Programme?   
 STEWART CINK: Well, I see the Olympics as the pinnacle of all the sports that are involved. You know, many other sports, it's such a do-or-die situation in the Olympics, where you wait so long, there's your chance and it comes and goes so quickly and the pressure is so intense.   
 To perform under that kind of pressure has always been sort of the dream come true for any athlete.
