Q.  At any time early in the round once it became obvious you were playing for second, were you ever thinking it might be really important to finish 18 -- nothing like getting ahead before a rain out?

STEWART CINK:   I was telling my caddie before on the front nine, I was laughing with my caddie on Thursday, playing with somebody like that, you are almost guaranteed for a twosome on the back, and I told my caddie we would be playing a twosome on the back.


Q.  What hole?

STEWART CINK:   No. 7.


Q.  You were joking? 

STEWART CINK:   Yeah, I'm joking.  I was also joking around with my caddie on 18 when I asked Tiger to move his mark, I was thinking I might purposely not remind him -- (Laughter.) And then go back and say, oh, wait, could you move it backÃ   -- after we signed the cards though.  We did a lot of joking around out there.  What else can you do?  It was mind-boggling watching the way he played.


Q.  Seems like it look a little pressure off everybody --

STEWART CINK:   Maybe so.  Really, being sick like that, it was impressive that he played well but it doesn't affect golf as much.  It's more difficult or for him to be out here and move around just going from shot to shot getting there and dealing with the fact that he's in front of all of these people feeling like crap.  Didn't affect him too much.  That third tee was probably where he looked the worst, the second par three.
