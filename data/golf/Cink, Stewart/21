 Q.   Just talk about all the starting and stopping ‑‑ you've been through it before.   
STEWART CINK:   These days, yeah, we've been through them but they are pretty unusual still.   You know, I think about a golf course like this, it's not really physically all that demanding.   It's flat and it's going to be wet but that's not a big deal.   
But it's a mental grind.   It is, it's a mental grind.   If you get it going a little sideways out there, I'm sure it will be windy again tomorrow, too.   This course can really work on you mentally and that takes its toll over 36 holes in one day.  
   
 Q.   With ball‑in‑hand, will that change the golf course with the rain?   
STEWART CINK:   I don't think it will change all that much except the rough will be more difficult.   The fairways were already very soft, and we were already getting great lies.   That part of it, around the greens you're going to get a perfect lie, even like a more desirable lie than you had today.   
The golf course itself, it's still going to be about hitting the ball in play.   You have to hit it in the fairway out here and not make the big numbers.
