Q.  Just talk about your play today and how you feel going into tomorrow.
STEWART CINK:  Well, I feel like I'm playing pretty well.  I'm in control for the most part, you know, and I'm managing myself when I miss; that's pretty good.  Putting's good.

You know, I feel like I've got a lot of momentum after last week, even though we didn't win.  I played pretty well and I'm really looking forward to the challenge this week and going out there and mixing it up.  You know, Tiger's well ahead.
Q.  Tiger talked during his press conference that he still feels like he has to make a lot of birdies, that 15 under is going to be nowhere near.
STEWART CINK:  I would say that's correct.  The course is yielding right now.  The greens are a great speed for putting.  You can be aggressive out here, and I think everybody in the field knows that.  And so you've probably seen a lot of putts made, I feel like I've made a lot, and just a lot of fun when you have greens as smooth as these and you just need to go ahead and just give it a roll.
