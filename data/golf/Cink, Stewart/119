  Q. Good playing today. Obviously nice to get a victory in the first round.   
 STEWART CINK: Yeah. It was a scrappy match. We both almost played exactly the same. We didn't hit that many fairways, but once we missed the fairways we did a good job from there of getting the ball in the hole. There was a few birdies out there and a lot of good par saves.   
 It's just typical match play. I was looking bleak, 1-down on 17 after missing the green, and then Richard missed the green from middle of the fairway and ended up making bogey and I won the hole. Then made a bomb on the first extra hole. I'm fortunate to be going through. I need to play a little bit better to keep on winning.  
  
  Q. Do you feel for your partner in that situation, when he's got a chance?  
 STEWART CINK: Well, you do feel for him. It's hard. Richard Sterne is a nice guy, too. We've known each other a little bit, and I like him. We talk a lot. Today was one of the more talkative matches I've ever played in because we were both chitchatting a little bit. That's pretty unusual. When you make a bomb, yeah, it feels great, but --  
  
  Q. How about going down extra holes? Did you say anything about, hey, we're holding up Tiger?  
 STEWART CINK: I just told everybody on the first tee there that he's waited eight months to play, he can wait two more minutes.  
  
  Q. Obviously you were in the final with him last year, so nice to maybe hopefully get back there?  
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, it would be great to get back there, and I have a feeling if I make the finals, I don't know how the brackets look, but I'd be playing Tiger because I think he's going to be there.
