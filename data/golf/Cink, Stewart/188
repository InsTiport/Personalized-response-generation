Q.  Just talk about the day a little bit, obviously the change in conditions, the difference.

ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, conditions were quite a factor.  I don't think it was that bad.  We had ball in hand in the fairway.  It was not easy, but at the same time it wasn't that difficult.
Q.  You guys started out pretty well.

ZACH JOHNSON:  We started out well.  We've been doing that every day, which is kind of our thing, but we just can't keep it going.  For whatever reason, I don't know, we lose momentum.  I mean, I lipped out six times today.  So I mean, you count those and give me half, and it's a different score.

We both made another bogey on a par 4 in the water that we thought the tee shot was pretty.  A couple bounces here or there it could have been that different.
Q.  There was a little excitement because the USA and Spain were playing together?

ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, that's always fun, we didn't get many claps, but they certainly did.  Granted, they played a little better, so that helps.  It's fine.  Sergio and Miguel are good guys, so they had a good following.
Q.  How hard was it?

STEWART CINK:  It wasn't hard really because we got a break.  There was a few spots of rain and some wind, but really the conditions weren't near as bad as they were supposed to be.

So we were    we just had a really hard time getting anything going.  We started off well and then I just    I think I did it to us because I missed about a 3 footer for birdie on a hole that was almost a par 3; was just an easy par 4 today for everybody that didn't drive right by the green.  I missed a short putt that would have kept some momentum going, and I missed it and it sort of stalled us.

We did birdie 17.  But we both hit really good drives on 18 and they both bounced left and rolled down in the water.  It's a narrow fairway, but we both hit good drives that ended up in the water and that really bummed us out big time.

Then we had some lipouts and some balls hanging on the edge.  I think we both started    really started trying to press and be perfect.  I started trying to take the team on my shoulders and Zach started trying to do the same thing and we just tied ourselves in a knot.  Not a good exhibition.  It wasn't ugly golf, it was just    it was just uninspired.  We just couldn't seem to get any real good momentum out thereafter the first    after that one missed putt.
Q.  For a while, you had a strong start and then you got into double figures, thought maybe it would be a good day?

STEWART CINK:  Well, we thought so, too.  It's a weird animal, team golf, because when you miss a short putt or when you have a hole like 18 where I made bogey, it really does seem to affect the momentum way more than it does when you're just playing on your own.  We miss putts and make bogeys all the time on our own, but when you do it in a team format, it seems like there is a momentum factor there.  It's really hard to quantify before you get into the round.  It really got us both    the first round and today.
