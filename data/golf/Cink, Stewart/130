 Q. Nice sweet 67 yesterday, where you did what you were supposed to do. Took advantage of the par-5s, very few mistakes. Today a little more excitement. You let a couple of short putts get away from you. 
 STEWART CINK: I am hitting the ball well. I did let a couple of putts go by. Out here it's tricky to read some of these greens. The ones that I missed, they're so flat that you're almost trying to pick up some break, and you're better off just sticking it in the hole. 

 Q. You have had so much success every place you've played this year, but to come back here where you've won before and to have a similar kind of run early on, does it give you any extra confidence going into the weekend?
 STEWART CINK: I think the confidence that I have is the two times I've won this, when I've come from behind by quite a bit, actually. So if anything, I know to be patient here, because anything can happen. 
 This course, it's giving up some birdies, but it's not an easy course. You can make bogey in a heartbeat here, just about any hole. I know to be patient and I've got 36 more holes.

 Q. Quick swing thought for me, you were working a lot today with going back in a practice swing. Tell me what you were up to then. 
 STEWART CINK: It's something that I've been working on really for the last three or four months. It's kind of coincided with me striking the ball better. I'm trying to make my swing as big as I can make it, my shoulder turn, my arc, everything, just make my swing as big and as patient and slow as I can make it. 
 I feel like when I do that, when I'm able to extend my shoulder turn and extend my arms and get the width, that I hit the ball more solidly. 

 Q. It's working, keep it up this weekend. 
 STEWART CINK: Thanks.
