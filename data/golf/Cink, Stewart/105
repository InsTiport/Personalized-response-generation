   STEWART CINK: Definitely experience plays a big part in low scoring. Watson, what can you say about his experience. It's second to very few. What you see is the weather is allowing some of the guys that may not be quite as long anymore, as the young kids, to attack the holes. And the golf course is set up where there's a lot of guys that have a lot of power that are laying back on some holes, because of the bunkers on both sides and you just don't trust the kicks.  
 So where I might be hitting a 2-iron out there to lay up short, some of those guys may be hitting a 3-wood or even taking driver, and Tom Watson is one of the best ball-strikers of all time. He's knows the way around here and I'm not surprised to see him up here.  
  
  Q. What do you think when you look up there and see him getting lower and lower?   
 STEWART CINK: It reminded me of the practise round a played with him at the Masters this year, when it was blowing about 30 miles an hour and it was cold. I didn't even want to be out there, and I don't think he missed a shot. He hit every shot down the fairway and every iron shot at the flag. It was very impressive for a guy that age to come out there on even a tougher golf course, Augusta National, and do that on a day like that. So it just made me think that he must have his ball-striking still in the same place it was then.
