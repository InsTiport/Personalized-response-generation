 Q.  Obviously 64 today, you played great.  What was working for you out there?  
STEWART CINK: Well, really, I just kept the ball, kept it in play on the holes where you really need to.  And the fairways I missed were holes where you can kind of get away with it.  I missed the fairway on a couple par-5s and/or one par-5.  But just seemed like, when I missed, it was in a reasonable place.  Sometimes when you hit the same shot it turns out bad and you get punished.   
But today was one of those days where I kind of took advantage of some pretty good shots and made a few putts and all facets of the game were working pretty well.   
 Q.  Thoughts overall on the golf course how it's playing?  
STEWART CINK: It's playing almost exactly the same as I remember from the last two years of being here.  We're not getting any roll.  So if you're doing your calculations and you're predicting your carry correctly, then you can really be aggressive.   
So, I've been doing a pretty good job of that this week.  I like playing here, it's fun.  It's a different kind of golf because of the heat and the fact the ball's just not going anywhere when it lands.  So it's almost like you're on the range hitting.  But every shot has definitely a lot of factors.
