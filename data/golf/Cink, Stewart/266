STEWART CINK:  Well, I am playing on the more difficult course of the four, but I think I haven't taken a lot at the averages.  But, I think this is probably the most difficult one.  So I feel pretty good out here even though I am going to have to do amazing tomorrow to win (inaudible). 
 

Q.  How easy is it to find birdies, especially on the last 18 holes when you are trying to win a championship?
 
STEWART CINK:  I am sorry.  I didn't hear that. 
 

Q.  How difficult is it to find birdies when you really know you need to get some when it is the last round?
 
STEWART CINK:  How easy is it to get birdies? 
 

Q.  I didn't hear him.  How difficult is it to get birdies knowing that you need them when it is the 18 last holes?
 
STEWART CINK:  (inaudible) There is a little added pressure.  You have to stay focused and remember that you have made enough birdies to get in that position, so (inaudible) can't force it.  
 
STEWART CINK:  I started on 10 and birdied the first par 5, No. 14.  Hit a sand wedge in there; made about made about a 10-footer.  Then I birdied 18.  I hit a 4-wood -- 7 fairway, 4-wood (inaudible) came out of the sand to about (inaudible) feet. 
 
STEWART CINK:  Four feet. 
 
STEWART CINK:  I hit a pitching wedge about two feet. 
 
STEWART CINK:  6, I was in the green (inaudible); had about a 10-footer for birdie.  (inaudible). 
 

Q.  Can you tell us about your off-season; how much you practiced and how much you played, how much you did other things, just a little synopsis of what you did?
 
STEWART CINK:  Okay, my season started at the JC Penney.  It was over about the 7th, 8th December and so I had a few weeks where I didn't play golf.  Took a vacation with my wife (inaudible) we (inaudible) I didn't get ready for the first tournament until about five days before I left.  For me it is good to get away from it for a while because it is a long year and you stay fresh.
