 Q.   Tough way to finish but still a good round and being back in the mix for Sunday.   
STEWART CINK:   Yeah, I was pretty pleased again today.   I played pretty similar to the way I have.   The course was not‑‑ I don't think it was giving it up quite as much, especially compared to yesterday morning, but yeah, I hate to finish that way.   I just threw away a couple shots there on the 18th hole.   Realistically I probably threw away one shot by making double.   I can't hang my head too much.   I made some putts today again, and I'm feeling pretty good, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Your confidence level going into tomorrow?   Do you feel like the game is there and ready to go?  
STEWART CINK:   Well, I don't know.   I'm hitting some nice shots, and I'm making some nice putts.   I feel like I'm thinking clearly out there, and I'm prepared.   I'll just see what tomorrow brings and go fight again, brave through more holes and just see what it adds up to.  
   
 Q.   We talked to some of the other guys when there's a logjam at the top here, it's even more just you against the course, you can't look at what other guys are doing.   
STEWART CINK:   You can't especially because you may be on a hole that's extremely difficult while the guy that's tied with you might be on a hole that's a driver, 6‑iron par‑5.   So the scores are just almost irrelevant out there until you actually finish and you sign your scorecard.
