 Q. You expected kind of perhaps a slow start coming back, but actually wouldn't you say this was a good start? 
 STEWART CINK: Well, I didn't expect a slow start, first of all. I was excited to get back out here and play. This course holds so many good memories for me over the years that I expected to come back out here and play well. Actually, coming off the round I'm a little disappointed because I thought I played a little bit better than what I got, than the score, especially finishing with bogeys on two of the last three. 

 Q. Everybody has been bogeying two of these last couple holes. What's going on? Is the course changing? 
 STEWART CINK: Well, the wind picked up a little bit out there the last hour, hour and a half, and the tougher holes are playing into the wind, 15, 16 and 18. Even though 16 is a par-5, if you drive it in the rough there it becomes a really demanding hole to make par on. That's what happened to me, I missed all the greens and just failed to convert some up-and-downs.

 Q. Some of the guys are saying the fairways are getting firm, so you have to be careful on the fairways as the afternoon groups go out. 
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, the golf course really is firming up quite a bit, and these fairways are already quite a bit narrow. As you know with the slopes, if you're not coming into the fairway with the right curve on the ball, it's going into the rough. The rough isn't the deepest rough we've played all year, it's medium, but you just have to be able to be in the fairway to be able to control your ball coming into the greens, or you're going to make some bogeys.

 Q. Is this a perfect course for a tune up for next week?
 STEWART CINK: It is. If there's a course on the TOUR that would make a major feel like a respite the week after, then this would be it.
