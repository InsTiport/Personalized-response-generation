  Q. There's probably no such thing as a comfortable win, but you've got to be happy with the way that finished.   
 STEWART CINK:  No, it was not a comfortable win at all because I was down through 8.  I was 1-down.  And then on the 8th hole, Miguel showed his first -- he opened the door just a little bit for me.  He missed a five-footer for par.  I had already bogeyed the hole, so he kind of let me go there with a halve.  Then I birdied the next hole, then eagled the next hole.  I won the next three holes, and then I went 2-up.  So I went from 1-down to 2-up.  But the real key was the par-3 where he stiffed it and I made about a 20-footer.   
  
  Q.  Match play is a different animal I'm sure, but when a player does that, when he misses a five-footer for par and you're struggling a little bit through eight holes, is that something like, okay, now let's make something happen?   
 STEWART CINK:  You just feel -- I expected to be 2-down after that, and then he kind of gave me a little bit of an opportunity.  I almost felt like I had won a hole because I felt like I was 2-down, and then suddenly I find myself 1-down, so I almost got a little bit of momentum and I hit it close for a gimme on the next hole.   
 The momentum just kind of flipped right there.  I felt it.  I'm sure he probably felt it a little bit, too.  Every swing of the club, every putt, momentum seems to change a little bit.  It's just a very interesting format.   
  
  Q.  Is this a good match play course?   
 STEWART CINK:  I'm very fond of this course.  It's a good match play course.  There's a lot of little spots around the green where you can find yourself in all kinds of awkward locations, and it takes a lot of imagination.  It's just a really good match play course.  I'm growing fonder and fonder of it.
