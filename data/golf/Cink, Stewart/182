Q. Exactly the start you needed, Stewart?
STEWART CINK:  I think so.  I really played well, and I think I probably could have got a couple more birdies out there, but any time you're in the 60s at a major, it doesn't matter where you are, you're pretty happy, and I'm happy with the round.  It was a good start, solid.  I saw a lot of things in my game today that I think I need to see the rest of the week to go on a big run.
Q.  Such as?
STEWART CINK:  Well, I drove it really well early, and this golf course you need to drive it pretty well to make birdies.  It's not going to be a par shooter's dream out here like a U.S. Open.  There's going to be birdies made.  So you need to have the frame of mind where you're going to be aggressive and try to get what you can get instead of just trying to tread water.

Driving the ball well is important.  I made a couple of adjustments to my game today in my swing that a couple of years ago I might not have been able to make, just little changes, but I had the confidence to go ahead and make.

Sometimes the game    it's played by human beings and we're not perfect, so we have to adjust sometimes.
Q.  Do you just need not to think about Ryder Cup?
STEWART CINK:  I'm not really having that hard a time with the Ryder Cup deal because I've got nothing to lose.  I mean, I'm in the position where moving down a couple spots to me really doesn't do much for me.  It doesn't hurt me much.  All I can do is move up.  If you're not inside the Top 10, then you're basically not on the map.  I've got a chance to move up on the map, but I don't have any down side.  I'm just playing to play.  I feel probably more calm about the Ryder Cup this time than I have about the last two or three races coming down the stretch.
