STEWART CINK:  I wish I hadn't bogeyed it, but I'm going to be the only guy to make bogey on that hole.  I played really well.  Yesterday I didn't play very well at all.  I didn't feel like I was myself out there.

I think myself showed back up today, and I made a lot of good shots and I was proud of myself.
Q.  Do you realize you tied the course record with your 29 on the front?
STEWART CINK:  I didn't realize that.  We don't look at too many records, but as far as my own personal records, I can't remember playing nine holes any better than that.  I don't think I missed a shot, and I didn't miss many putts, either.
Q.  7 under, you're three shots off the lead?
STEWART CINK:  Yeah, it's still early.  I just hope I haven't gotten all my birdies off in one round because I birdied half the holes out there today.  Hopefully there's still a lot left in my tank.
Q.  It's only the second time you've ever played this tournament.  Why?
STEWART CINK:  Well, it's pretty easy to explain that.  It's usually the 4th of July weekend, and for my family, we're usually all together on the 4th of July.  Unfortunately this tournament has always been the victim of that.  But this year with the 4th being on Tuesday, I felt like I could make it up here after the 4th and get here in time to play and prepare.

I love the golf course.  It's one of the best courses on Tour, and the tournament staff has been really friendly and they always do a great job.  I think I'll be back here.
Q.  Did you feel for Phil out there having a tough round?
STEWART CINK:  Not really because he's had plenty of good rounds (laughter).  No, that was not the Phil Mickelson that you'll probably see tomorrow.  Phil just struggled from the very beginning, made some bogeys early, and it happens.  This is a tough course and it's tough to get yourself out of a hole.
