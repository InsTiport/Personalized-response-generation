  Q.  What can you pick up from the way Tiger handles himself?   
 STEWART CINK:  Whether he's two shots behind or wherever he is, he's always the same.  There's a lesson to be learned from that.   
  
  Q.  You've played with him a couple times.  How would you judge this round or how he played the last two days compared to what you've seen in the past?   
 STEWART CINK:  I'd say this is the best I've seen him play.  The last couple days, off the tee, the control he had was just really very impressive.  The Tiger that we saw a year and two years ago, hitting it sort of all over the place, kind of like I hit it today, I think that's a thing of the past.  He's got it geared down and he came out and played really well.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 STEWART CINK:  Yeah, he plays very smart, hits the right shot.  He very rarely puts himself into position where he's going to make worse than the occasional bogey.  Most of the time he's going to make a lot of birdies.   
  
  Q.  As a member of the policy board I'm sure you're kept up to speed, what's your reaction to what's going on at Westchester this year?   
 STEWART CINK:  Well, first of all, we were already prepared to be moving that tournament around the metro area, and when the FedExCup Playoffs falls and the tournament moved from -- I think it was in June before to late August, that's a time when the club membership uses the club a lot, and the club put a lot of limitations on what we could do to set up the tournament at that course, and it made life difficult for Barclays.  So that's one side of it.
