   STEWART CINK: I'm glad to get the event underway, and now it's time for the serious matter to get started. I love playing with Chad. He and I go way back. We are close to the same age and have a lot in common, so just looking forward to it, yeah.   
  
  Q. Does this course lend itself to aggressive style of play, got to score low numbers and got to be conservative; is that accurate?  
 STEWART CINK: Not always. There's some yellow lights out there. Some of the pins can be tucked and probably will be. Some of the distances, you've got some long holes. You've got some 500-yard par 4s. If you hit the fairway, you can be pretty aggressive most of the time but there's going to be some yellow lights where you need to play smart, too.  
  
  Q. Being one of the veterans, have you been able to draw on your past Ryder Cup experience and have you been able to impart that to the rookies of this team?  
 STEWART CINK: I have tried to. There's some new answers with the formats that I think catch people off-guard the first time they play. It has nothing to do with how these guys play golf they definitely are solid players that don't need to be taught anything. But sometimes the nuances can throw you off a bit and I just tried to prepare them a little bit for what to expect.  
  
  Q. Just opportunity to meet Ali today what, did that mean to you?  
 STEWART CINK: JUST the fact that Muhammad Ali would take time out of what he's doing to come out here to some golf tournament and see us hit the ball, that really is pretty moving to me considering his health and all of the directions he's put in to come out here and decide on his own that he wanted to be with the American Ryder Cup Team and meet us all and meet the captain is very moving.
