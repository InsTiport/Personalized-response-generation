Q.   Talk about your day.  Good one so far.
STEWART CINK:  I was playing really well out there.  I hit a lot of fairways, and with these conditions, the rain really changed the course since yesterday.  It's playing vulnerable.

Lift, clean and place, no wind, soft greens.  If you can make a few putts and keep it in play, you're probably going to shoot a decent score.
Q.   Is it playing long, though?
STEWART CINK:  Not really.  It's playing longer, but if you're hitting the ball pretty well, it's just nice to see it go through the air and not be affected by the wind because yesterday when I played in my practice round it was blowing like crazy.  It felt harder than Whistling Straits.
Q.   You played well here, but is it a coincidence that you're playing really well after getting a Ryder Cup berth?  Do you have more confidence or are you feeling better about your game because of that?
STEWART CINK:  Well, it didn't hurt but I don't think it really had any effect.  I'm obviously glad I've been picked and it's nice to start out in this tournament right after that, but it really is more of an indication of the way I've been playing for the last couple months than just one pick.
