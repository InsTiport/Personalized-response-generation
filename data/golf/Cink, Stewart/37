  STEWART CINK:   Well, I don't know.   I was into my own thing.   I didn't see many of the other scores except for D.A. Points in my group, much it was a good day for ball striking.   Almost identical to yesterday.   Very good decision-making out there.   Me and my caddy, Matt Hall, really worked out picking out good lines and committing to those, and, you know, it was just a really good, positive kind of day where there's a lot of trouble on this course and you can get a little scared, but we stayed very positive and it work, it worked really well.

Q.   How about the momentum going into Saturday?
STEWART CINK:   Yeah.   I've been threatening to put a round like this together for quite awhile.   I've been striking the ball really well and just haven't really taken advantage of a lot of opportunities, and today early on a few putts went in and it's amazing how much bigger the hole looks when a few go in early.   All day it just felt really, really nice and calm out there.

Q.   How do you feel about going into the weekend?
STEWART CINK:   Yeah, I feel good about the way I'm playing.   I need to just keep doing the same things.   I'm not going to be changing a lot.   The wind direction is supposed to be almost the same every day.   If we can just avoid some storms, it will be great. 
I'm excited to be in position to maybe, you know, make a charge or, you know, within shouting distance of the lead anyway, going into a weekend or into a last round, it would be -- that's why we play the game.

Q.   Did the wind lie down a little?
STEWART CINK:   I don't think so.   It blew.   I guarantee you out on 18 -- it never blew really hard, but it blew the right amount really for a good test and you had to be definitely on your -- you had to be attentive out there.
