Q.
It's never easy out here, but it must be a good win to beat a player like Tom Lehman.
STEWART CINK:  Yeah, I respect Tom quite a bit, he's played so well for a long time.  Neither of us started out well today.  I played well after about    I made a par putt to tie the hole about a 12 footer that kind of got the juices flowing a little bit.

And I played really well there from    I think that was on 5    through about 12.  I played really well, made a lot of birdies and really built a lead.  And then I had a chance to go 4 up with six to play, and missed about a 5 footer for birdie.  I didn't miss the 5 footer for par on the next hole.

So I went from being possibly 4 up to 2 up and then made another bogey down a few more holes later.

So match play is a strange animal.  I felt like I was in total control, and then I felt like I had no control.  You hate to lose to a player making bogey on the last hole.  It's a tough hole, and I made par there.  I'm pleased to go on.
Q.  Is it nice to get a win in this format against the Ryder Cup captain?
STEWART CINK:  Yeah.  I told my caddie last night I was hosed either way, because if I beat him I'd hurt his feelings and he wouldn't want to take me.  And if I didn't beat him, he wouldn't pick me because he'd think I didn't play well in the match.  Either way I just    no, probably Tom won't even remember this match.
Q.  On a day like today is it nice to get right back out here this afternoon, or do you kind of wish you could go back and relax and play tomorrow?
STEWART CINK:  I guess it's good to keep going, either way.  You lose, you can get home earlier; if you win, you've won two matches in a day instead of just one.  This is good.  We're all warmed up and the golf course is drying out every moment.  It's going to be a fun afternoon.
