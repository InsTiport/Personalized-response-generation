  Q.  Regarding course change from yesterday.   

 STEWART CINK:  The biggest change is the wind being down.  Although, it's still a factor, but a lot less.   

 They put some water on the greens so they're not quite as fast.   
  
  Q.  How about the pin placements?   

 STEWART CINK:  There are some unusual ones.  Sure, there are some you would expect, but after 12 years there are some unusuals.   

 I was baffled by 17.  I've never seen it there.  It was kind of right in the middle, with nothing around it to tell the break.   

 There are some birdies out there to be made.   

 When the weather is dry, the course is as tough as it says.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the committee members and the course set-up.   

 STEWART CINK:  I think they are a sharp bunch of individuals.  I think they want to see birdies and keep the patrons happy.  I don't think they like this over par business.  They want to make it exciting for the patrons.   

 Playing the course today you felt like something more was going to happen.  The pins on 13 and 15 are in position for some eagles.
