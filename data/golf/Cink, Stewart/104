   STEWART CINK: You know, it's funny over here. The weather dictates what your score is, but you feel like you play -- I felt like I played the same every day. I hit the ball well. I've kept it in play, avoided the bunkers for the most part.   
 But, you know, shot 4-under the first day and then I shot over par both days. A little bit of wind gets up and it gets a lot trickier.   
 Yeah, today it was a good day. It could have been better. I had a couple of hiccups out there where I made a bad swing on 5 and it cost me a shot and then I missed about a two-footer on 7, it cost me a bogey there on that par-5 after being in the bunker off the tee. It wasn't a day where I felt like I got everything out of it, but I think there's still hope.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, I mean apart from Tom Watson there's a lack of experience up on the leaderboard in front of me in majors. I've got experience in majors, I just haven't won any. I think tomorrow I'm just going to come out here and try to attack the course a little bit, do the same thing I've been doing and just keep my composure. That's really all you can do. The golf course is so difficult, you can't really alter your strategy based on where you are.
