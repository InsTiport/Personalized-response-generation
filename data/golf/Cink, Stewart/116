  Q. Successful so far in this tournament, maybe not the finish today you wanted against Ogilvy, but he sure got hot at the right time?  
 STEWART CINK: He did. He played very solidly. Really all day. His game is such a simple game, but with power. He doesn't really do anything really that fancy, but when he does get out of position, his short game is one of the top-5 out here on TOUR and it's tough to beat him when he's on and he played really well today.   
  
  Q. People maybe don't value his short game as they should. He hit some good shots off some bad lies out there.   
 STEWART CINK: He did. There's a lot of shots out here where you really have to take a lot of risk on to get the ball close from around the greens. And whenever he was faced with one of those he did a good job of getting it close.   
 And he made a few putts too. He played very solidly, I would be very surprised if he doesn't win tomorrow.   
  
  Q. You're playing on Sunday at this event, that's still a pretty good job, I would think.   
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, I definitely, you know, I didn't have anything to look back on to be real happy about before this year. And I took off three weeks and sort of cleansed my mind and worked really hard on my short game and it's paid off.   
 I definitely felt a lot more confident and felt like I had a little bit more of a swagger here this week and my results showed it.   
 I would have loved to have gotten to the finals and gotten a chance to avenge last year's loss, but either way, you know, to get down to the semis here you've done pretty good.  
  
  Q. Still got a chance to win on Sunday, right?  
 STEWART CINK: Still got a chance to win.
