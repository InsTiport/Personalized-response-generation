Q. Just talk about your round today.
STEWART CINK: Stewart Cink.  It was -- you know, after yesterday's round with Tiger, it felt like a practice round, even though you're playing the final round of a Major with a top-10 player in the world and the group in front of Tiger.  It was still pretty intense out there.  The heat was big.  You know, I had some focus -- you know, moments where I kind of fell asleep a bit, missed some really short putts, which is unfortunate and uncharacteristic.
But overall, I was really proud of the way I hung in there.  I handled myself really well and kept pressing, and I'm going to come up short here, but it was a really good, solid week for me overall.
