Q.   What was it like to tee off five minutes after the big three?
STEWART CINK:   Well, that didn't really have much of an impact on our play early on, but what did was the cold and we were the first players in this year's Masters.   Every hole, whoever hit first was like, the first guy to hit into that tee.   The first guy to hole out.   The first birdie, all that.   So it just kind of felt a little bit strange out there.   And being a twosome our pace was very relaxed.   Tomorrow we're going to have do the same.

Q.   You were really warm until 14 and 15, what happened?
STEWART CINK:   Well, 14 I just made a mistake from the fairway, and I hit it left and the pin was left.   You just can't be there.   I just hit a bad iron shot and got myself in a place I shouldn't be.
My third shot, my chip hung up on the fringe, and had that big downhill drive and couldn't get it anywhere near the hole.   I only hit one shot bad. 
And then 15 I was in the right trees and my chip out, my punch out, hit a tree limb and came back ten yards over my head.   So I had to redo that shot.   I made a good up and down for par there from about a hundred yards.

Q.   What about your read on 17?
STEWART CINK:   17 was a really nice shot.   Good look the birdie from just behind the hole, but not really that much downhill, about nine feet, maybe.   And I hit right where I wanted to.   It didn't break as much as you thought.   It stayed out there.

Q.   18?
STEWART CINK:   18 I hit a poor tee shot a little bit left.   And hit a magnolia tree, you can only advance it maybe a hundred yards.   And did pretty well to give myself a real good look at par, I hit a wedge up there.   I had 119, on my third shot, and hit it about ten feet but didn't make it.

Q.   Do you feel good about the round?
STEWART CINK:   It was a pretty good round.   I think what I did the best out there is I stayed very much in the present and hit the shots for what they were, and that was just making swings.
If you get caught up in controlling where your ball goes, there's a lot that can go wrong.   And you can kind of get overwhelmed.   I did a pretty good job of that today.   Would I like to have driven a little bit better?   Yeah.   Put myself in a little bit better attack position coming into the greens.
All in all, it's not a bad round.

Q.   Stewart, not to belabor the point, but there's not too many people in your generation who can say they teed off after Gary, Jack and Arnie at the Masters.   I know you're in your groove.   But did you take a moment to see what they were doing?
STEWART CINK:   I didn't, because I was kind of getting ready for my round.   I did say hi to all three of them.   I walked to the putting green and they walked in after the shot.   I got to speak to them.   They offered me quick words of encouragement, which is nice.

Q.   You don't see that at Yankee Stadium, or any other sport.   When you're talking about the history and tradition of what makes the Masters special, is that it, right there?
STEWART CINK:   It is, that's part of it.   There's so many things, but that's definitely part of it, to be able to‑‑ I think I hit first off the first tee, too, so I was the first ball struck after those guys hit it.   That was cool.   Just to be around them in any way is neat.   But to actually hit a shot, and knock it past them, that was cool.

Q.   Considering the rain on Monday, no golf course changes more from Monday to Thursday.   Did the conditions change?   Did they move along like you thought they were?
STEWART CINK:   Well, I can't really see initially, because I didn't play one hole yesterday, except the par‑3.   It changed a lot from Monday‑‑ I mean Tuesday.
But overall this wasn't that wet Tuesday.   I don't believe they got the rain they anticipated getting.   It was under an inch. 

Q.   On Monday?
STEWART CINK:   Yeah.   I don't know the weather report, but I came from Atlanta, and I saw what was happening there in the morning, and I drove over here and saw what was happening over here, and it was a lot lighter.
The course drained well, it was already quite playable on Tuesday.   And then today we're still not getting very much roll on the fairways, but that almost never happens here, you don't get that much roll, not anymore.   And the greens, once we got rid of the dew out there, they were very fast, very fast.   It was a lot of fun on some of those pin putts out there today.
