 Q. Your thoughts on Round 1? 
 STEWART CINK: It was good day for scoring really. Until the rain came, it was playing as easy as it could possibly play out here. I took advantage of it. 
 I didn't really hit the ball great, but I did hit some good irons and I made some good putts. I hit into the hazard off 9 and had to take a five, but that's a tough hole.

 Q. This is a tough hole to finish on. You got to know that. Obviously, you with a tough finishing stretch today with 7, 8 and 9. Is there a distinct advantage to your draw, or everybody's got to play every hole?
 STEWART CINK: I think the advantage or disadvantage will be determined by what this rain does the rest of the day. If it keeps doing this -- the course plays about, probably an average of 30 yards longer per hole when it's raining like this. 
 And we didn't have much to deal with today at all in the way of wind or rain until the last hole or two. And now that this has started it feels like a persistent one, and this afternoon may be very difficult.

 Q. At least you have a place you could probably stay and sit around an watch. Talk about playing at home. A lot of guys don't like playing on their home course because of the other demands. What do you think about it?
 STEWART CINK: I'm in that camp as well. There was a time when I really, really enjoyed playing this one because it's in my backyard and all, and I still enjoy that part of it. But there's more going on now than there use to be when I'm playing and it's distraction. 
 But also at the same time I kind of enjoy the challenge that that moves on to. I have to do a little bit more to stay focus and it's good practice for big tournaments like majors when there's other distractions.

 Q. Stewart, thanks. Good luck this week. 
 STEWART CINK: Thanks. 

 Q. Stewart Cink, missed that beginning and the end of the round. In between though, the six birdies, talk about scoring opportunities. 
 STEWART CINK: It was out there today. There was very little wind and the greens are very smooth. I mean you can make putts on these greens. And this afternoon with this rain coming I think the scoring will be a little more difficult so we definitely got a good break.

 Q. The rain didn't begin in earnest until you were just about finishing your round. Just how much longer will the course be as a result of what we expect to be a pretty steady downpour?
 STEWART CINK: If you take away the Par 3s, all the Par 4s play 30 yards longer basically in this rain. That means finishing on the front nine is extremely difficult with 7, 8 and 9 all brutal holes lengthwise. 
 It's just a lot more difficult to play, you know, when the rain's coming down. You got a lot more to deal with. You got drops of water all over the place and it's just something they'll have to contend this with afternoon.

 Q. You had some near-misses this year and just plain weird DQ withdrawal situation about the now changed bunker-to-bunker rule in New Orleans, but you kept your head up. What's working well in your game? What's working well in your attitude?
 STEWART CINK: My attitude is always there. My game is-- I've been working pretty hard on it and doing some good things, it's paying off and it's enjoyable. It's easy to have a good attitude when you are doing a lot of things well. 
 I have been playing pretty well. I haven't been driving perfectly or making every putt or getting up and down from everywhere, but I've just been, overall just hanging in there. And it's sort of an intangible type thing. And I've been very pleased. I'd love to have a win and I'd like to maybe bat a couple of the wins the rest of the year but so far I've played really well and I can't complain.

 Q. This time of year, just with The U.S. Open on the horizon you start to think about managing your game and peaking at just the right time?
 STEWART CINK: I think this time of year you start thinking about maybe slowing it down a bit until you hit that U.S. Open, British Open stretch and maybe play sparingly and just keep the rust off but not over do. 
 We're coming off stressful tournaments, The Masters, The Players, only those tournaments really -- they wear on you, especially if you're in contingent in those tournaments. Mentally it takes a lot out of you. So I think it's good time of the year to actually refresh. 
 Playing here at home it gives me a chance to play in the tournament and sort of relax a little bit.

 Q. And tuck your kids into bed at night. Excellent. Thank you.
