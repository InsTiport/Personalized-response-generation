  Q. Talk a little bit about your round today.   
 STEWART CINK: Well, today was frustrating because I hit the ball really well all day, and I gave myself a lot of chances, and I just -- I did not capitalize. I threw away a lot of opportunities out there, and today was -- this is spoiling the field, this weather. The greens weren't even -- I don't think they prepared them as fast as they usually do.   
 It was a day for scoring out there. I didn't take advantage of it, and I hit the ball really well. Frustrating day overall, but it's not over. If I had shot 77 today, you know, I'd be a little more upset. But with being even par, even par is not the end of the world out here.
