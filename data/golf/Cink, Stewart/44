   STEWART CINK: It just punished me today and I deserved it. 

 Q. What did you hit on 17?
 STEWART CINK: 5-iron. 

 Q. And you said it went in the drink?
 STEWART CINK: Yeah. Bad shots all day. 

 Q. How much of it was the course and how much of it was --
 STEWART CINK: No, it wasn't the course. The course is hard but the course is hard for everybody. And there are still guys that are shooting some decent scores. I played horrible. 
 I mean, since Friday at Bridgestone, I've been playing very poorly, and it's really disappointing because I was playing very well before that. Just really quite difficult to say, you know, when you play a major right here in your backyard and you have high hopes to come out here and do this; embarrassing and just unpleasant.

 Q. That said, you shoot a 69 yesterday but do you feel you sort of --
 STEWART CINK: Yesterday I played pretty well. I executed the things I worked on and practiced pretty well. And I had some confidence coming out today, but even on the range, I just didn't have -- I couldn't find much. I just, you know, all it took was one or two bad shots on the golf course and I was fragile and weak out there, and it showed.
