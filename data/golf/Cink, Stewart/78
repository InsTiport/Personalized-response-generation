  Q. (No microphone.)  
 STEWART CINK: No, I just hit some bad shots. The wind was blowing all day. Actually got a lot easier on the back nine after we got through about 11. But just bad shots caught up with me. You can't hide out here.   
  
  Q. Did you get that scary shot on 15?  
 STEWART CINK: I don't know what happened on 15. I hit it in the right trees and that pine straw, I had to chip straight out. I had like 160 to the hole for the third shot and I hit a nice shot, but it was misjudged and it hit and landed and went back there.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, some.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 STEWART CINK: It was distasteful. That was probably the most appropriate word for it, for what they did. And I don't know if they get a lot of satisfaction out of that, if they're pranksters or jokesters then good for them.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised about the low numbers today?  
 STEWART CINK: A little surprised because of the wind, but the greens stayed pretty soft. They were receptive out there today again, so if you could control the flight of it, you could get it to stop on the green.   
 So to that end, no, it wasn't surprising. But wind blew pretty hard and it almost blew so hard that it wasn't tricky to figure out. It just was, there was no swirling at all it was just a blowing hard wind out there.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, pretty much. It's just that this golf course the line between heroics and disaster is so fine that if you end up on the wrong side, you just, you don't even come up for air. It adds up in a hurry.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 STEWART CINK: Well it was straight into you, but then it was right around that time when the rain was coming down. So the wind sort of stopped there for about 10 or 15 minutes and when I hit my second shot on that hole, we, I say we, we were playing for that wind and it just died.   
 So I hit it over the green there. Which is, you cannot hit it over the green on that hole. Actually hit one of my better shots and it just went too far and I had nothing.   
 When you get adjusted to the wind and then it dies, that's when it becomes tricky out here because you don't know what to trust. If you're already not trusting what you're doing with your golf game that day, if you're not, then it just really becomes difficult to hit shots.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 STEWART CINK: It's just easy to become tentative and defensive out there. The golf course is so tough and you got, that's why the wind that swirls make it's so tough here because it's just a fine line between good and bad. A foot or two here or there and you're in trouble.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 STEWART CINK: No, because this is the type of day when Tom Watson is going to be able to compete at a place like Augusta National against the best players in the world. Windy, experience pays off, and that's exactly his kind of game. He hits the ball very solid, not very high, not very far, but if you hit the ball solidly and you can control it in the air, then it doesn't matter if you're hitting a 4-iron or a 9-iron, you can play here.   
  
  Q. Surprised by this leaderboard?  
 STEWART CINK: Surprised to see Tiger Woods on the leaderboard? Boy, have we gone a long way down.   
 (Laughter.) No. Not surprised.
