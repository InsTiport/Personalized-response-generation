  Q.  Well played, just a phenomenally great round of golf you played today and, you're here by yourself and you're the man.   
 STEWART CINK:  Yeah, but when you're by yourself and you've won, that means you didn't win your match early, and I'm happy to do it.  In match play you don't want to keep playing golf when you're ahead.   
 So I'm happy to be the one to clinch the point for the U.S. Team.  We came into this week with a little score to settle up in the international golf arena, and I think we showed everybody that we can play again.
