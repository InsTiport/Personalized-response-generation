Q.  5-under par, a nice start to the season?

STEWART CINK:  Yeah, thank you.  It was a good start.  I played pretty solid, made a few mistakes.  Overall, I was pretty happy.  I don't feel very bad, I feel good after the first round of the year.
Q.  How was your putting today?

STEWART CINK:  It came out fine.  I got a new putter in the bag, a new Nike putter.  I felt pretty solid, it felt like the ball was rolling the way I was hoping it would.
Q.  Can you talk about the course conditions today?

STEWART CINK:  Well, the ball is rolling more now.  It's drying out.  It's getting back to the Kapalua that we are used to seeing.  The greens are probably always going to be the story here.  It's always challenging.  The grain and the slope are doing different things, and you've got some that will just stifle you.  I was able to get it around the hole sometimes, and luckily a few went in.

Q.
Here we go and you're off at 5-under, pretty good start to the season?

JONATHAN KAYE:  Yeah, it was good playing with Vijay today.  He dragged me a long with him.  My game is a little rickety.  I putted all right, I only had one bogey and I look forward to tomorrow.
Q.  He had a heck of a run going mid-round?

JONATHAN KAYE:  Yeah, he always plays good.  He always plays good when he plays with everybody.

But in the past, we've both probably fed off each other pretty nice, a nice pairing for me and I look forward to it.
Q.  What do you think over the next three days, a tough course to read the greens?

JONATHAN KAYE:  It just depends on the wind, and, you know, all the other variables.

Today, the course has got more grass on it than I've ever seen.  Of course, I haven't seen it that much, but compared to last year, the greens are a little slower, a little fuller.  Kind of hard to judge your speed out there.
