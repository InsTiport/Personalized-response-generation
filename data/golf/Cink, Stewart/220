STEWART CINK:   I was happy with the play I played  and happy with the way I scrambled.  I found a way through and I am happy with the way I scored.  Fortunately I just started a little too far back.
Q.  What's it like playing a course like this chasing guys like Daly, Tiger and Vijay watching them drop birdie after birdie?
STEWART CINK:   When you start after six shots behind and you look up one of the guys in front of you is 5 under through five, it's a little demoralizing out there.  I played with Jeff Sluman today, we started off really nicely, a couple birdies early but just ran into a streak of pars and on this course, par is not always great.
Q.  Top 10 finish gives you a help in Ryder Cup standings.
STEWART CINK:   I was trying to focus on the Buick Open, and the Ryder Cup is one of those things that you play really well, it will take care of itself.  At least the way in my mind, it's not good for me to go out and say:  I have to try to play good to make the team.  I'll focus on The INTERNATIONAL and then the PGA after that.
Q.  On 17, how much does a gallery like this affect a tournament?
STEWART CINK:   It probably doesn't really affect play that much.  The one thing you do not want to do there is do something stupid like miss a one foot putt or something like that. Everybody is a little careful there on the tap ins there.
