  Q. How does it feel to be a part of a group that everybody plays a part in every year if they win a major here in the PGA Championship the first couple of days?  
 STEWART CINK: You mean the group with the spoilers? Yeah, it was great. It was cool. In fact, walking off the last green I spoke to Lucas's caddie. We're all good friends. And I spoke to him and said: Lucas, why don't we step back here for a second and have a ceremonial pairing.   
 He had made bogey, so he met me with an expletive. (Laughter). It was fun. Those guys are good to play with. There's a lot of confidence in the group and the crowd is very supportive. It was really fun.  
  
  Q. You know what it's like now to be a major champion playing at a major. And you look at a guy like Lucas Glover who has gone through, I guess, a few weeks earlier than you. What do you think of the way he's handled himself here the last four, five weeks?  
 STEWART CINK: I think it's very admirable. But he's played a lot. He had a schedule set. He wins the U.S. Open. A lot of guys would have said: Hold on now, I need to reel it back in a little bit but not Lucas Glover. He honored every commitment he made. That's a sure sign that there's a lot of character under that outfit that he's got on.
