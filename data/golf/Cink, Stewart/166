  Q.  Stewart, 3 and 2 over Jeev Milka Singh.  Talk me through the match.   
 STEWART CINK:  Well, I lost the first hole right off the bat to go 1-down.  I was pretty focused most of the way, all the way, really.  Not too many shots that I felt like I was lazy on.   
 It was -- we both played fairly well.  I made a few more birdies.  He probably wishes he could have a few shots over around the greens that he didn't capitalize on.   
 All in all, I was pleased with the way I played.  To come away with a win, it doesn't matter who you're playing, whether it's No. 1 or No. 64, you're always pleased in this tournament.   
  
  Q.  What was the key of the match do you think?   
 STEWART CINK:  There's no question it was the eighth hole.  I had just birdied 7 to go 2-up and then hit an indifferent shot on the par 3, and Jeev hit it in there about four feet.  I was on the fringe off the collar there, and I made about a 25-footer and he missed his.  Instead of going 1-up I went 3-up.  I felt like I was in pretty good control after that.   
 But match play you have to be careful not to get too overconfident because you have to play the whole way.  You just can't let up at all.  At the end of the match I felt like I let up just a little bit.  I wasn't quite as crisp on my decision making and my commitment out there.  I hit a few shots that could have put somebody else in the match if they were on top of their game.  I learned a lesson from that.   
  
  Q.  Finally, you're depriving the public of a Singh-Singh match-up in round three.  Are you aware of that?   
 STEWART CINK:  I didn't really think too much about it but I was aware of it.  I think it was The Golf Channel I heard say something about if both guys win their first two matches they could play each other.  I guess I apologize to everyone (laughter).
