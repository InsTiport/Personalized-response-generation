STEWART CINK:  Three or four rounds, played pretty well and then I played good today with Corey.  It's up to them and I've done everything I can do now, aside from qualify.  So it's in their hands.
Q.  When would it mean to get that captain's pick?
STEWART CINK:  Well, it would mean a lot.  It would definitely be the satisfaction of a huge goal of mine to make the team this year because of the fact that I've played on four of the last five teams, international competition and I really don't want to miss any.

So I feel like I can help the team, and if I'm picked, I'll be honored and I'll try to represent the U.S. as best I can.
Q.  Do you know how you would even find out, would a call be made to you tonight, or would it be more of a tomorrow morning thing?
STEWART CINK:  Just going on what happened last time with Hal Sutton, I got a call on Sunday afternoon about the same time I LANDED into Atlanta, which is home.  He said, "Let's do it."

I would assume that Tom will call everybody who is in the mix for picks and say yeah or nay.  So I expect a call tonight one way or the other.
Q.  Can you talk about Corey's game?  Tom says Corey is still in the mix for a captain's pick.
STEWART CINK:  I tell you, Corey Pavin gets a lot out of his golf game.  He's a grinder, has a great short game and a lot of imagination and he hits some shots that you're standing there going, "How did he think of that?"  His imagination is just beyond most of ours, so it's fun to watch him play and I would not be surprised if Tom was highly considering Corey.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  I would like to play with Corey because we're friends and I hope I get to spend a week with him in about a month or so.  But I don't really think it matters.  These guys have seen what I have to offer in my golf game and I've seen their offerings.  So just one round is not really going to make or break my chances of getting on the team.
Q.  How much was it on your mind these last couple days?
STEWART CINK:  You know, it really wasn't that much on my mind.  I felt like I was in a position where I had very little to lose, other than, you know, I wanted to qualify with a Top 10 finish here and I really wanted to be in contention because this is a pretty big tournament, and I shot myself out of it on Friday.

And I really didn't feel like I had a lot to worry about.  Once my scores weren't going to qualify me in the Top 10, then it really doesn't    it's not really a one round or a weekend at the PGA type thing to see who qualifies.  It's a two year process.  Luckily I got enough points to get myself up close to the rarefied air of the Top 10, but not quite.  I'll have to rely on somebody else to decide if I belong in there or not.
Q.  Have you had any discussions with Tom?
STEWART CINK:  We talked a good bit about the Ryder Cup but not about me participating in the Ryder Cup.  He knows I've got some experience in it and he's bounced a few ideas off me.  He and I have gone back and forth talking about stuff that's happened in the past and what's been good and what's not been so good.

So yeah, there's been a lot of talk but nothing specific.  I would never put him in a position to have to respond to any kind of questions or anything like that.
Q.  Does it work in your favor being a captain's pick once already, or do you think that might hurt you?
STEWART CINK:  Well, I got picked last time and we lost by one of the heaviest margins ever.  So I don't think that helps.  Not that it was all my fault, but I didn't exactly play great at the Ryder Cup last time.
Q.  Do you think your Presidents Cup record helps?
STEWART CINK:  It might.  You know, once you play in a bunch of them, you even out the wins and the losses.  I had a great first Presidents Cup and since then I've been right around .500 and maybe even below it in competition.  So I've    but one thing do I have is I've been there, and I know what it's going to be like to step on the first tee at The K Club, and there's a lot of people that aren't quite able to feel that yet.
Q.  Do you think the experience comes into play given the fact he could have in the Top 10 four rookies?
STEWART CINK:  Again, that's one of those speculating cap questions you'll have to ask Tom Lehman.  I think if I was the captain I would probably want to have at least a good mix of some experience and some new talents on the team.

But Tom is definitely going about things a little bit differently than guys in the past.  So you know, I wouldn't    nothing is going to surprise me what he does in his picks.  He's got a lot of open options.
Q.  Will you sit by the phone rest of the day or what does the rest of the day look like?
STEWART CINK:  Well, luckily my cell phone sits in my pocket, so I don't have to sit on anything.  He's got my number.
Q.  Inaudible?
STEWART CINK:  Right now the one thing I bring is I'm playing pretty well.  I'm having some good results and I'm hitting a lot of good shots.  I'm seeing shots and I'm producing them.  I'm really very disappointed, I can't stress that enough, how I've played yesterday and Friday to really give myself no chance to win here.  I really played well last time it was here and I felt great on the golf course and just shot myself in the foot.

But I think I'm playing well and I'm playing the kind of golf that would make a good team member I think, grinding it out.  I'm grinding in all my putts and I'm never giving up on my shots.  And me and my caddie have a good thing going right now.  I've been with him for about nine years.  I feel like I'm playing okay and I think I'm ready to win a tournament.  If that tournament happens to be the Ryder Cup, then I'll be happy with that.
