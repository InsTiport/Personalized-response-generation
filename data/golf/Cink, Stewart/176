Q.  What are your thoughts on the first round?
STEWART CINK:  Well, I'm really happy to be playing with J.J.  We've been anticipating it since we came together over here on our practise trip.  We get along well, really well, and have a lot in common and games are complementary to each other, very similar.
Q.  What are your thoughts on playing another rookie with Paul Casey and Robert Karlsson?
STEWART CINK:  I like playing with the younger players, I do.  I've been out there a few more times than J.J. has.  It's always fun to be able to lead.  That's a part of golf that we really don't ever get to experience except for in these deals.
Q.  How do you think you're going to be the leader?
STEWART CINK:  Not through anything like golf strategy, but he's going to be nervous.  I'm going to be nervous, too.  It's a nerve wracking experience.  We'll be nervous.  But I think I can help J.J. calm himself down a little bit, and just I'll remind him of a few things along the way of what got him here.

He's playing great.  J.J. is playing about as good as anybody on our team right now.  I'm sure there's going to be a lot of good golf played.
