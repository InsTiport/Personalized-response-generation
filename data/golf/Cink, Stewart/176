Q.
Stewart, these matches are grinding right down to the wire.  You tried not to let it get away from you and do the best you can and if you grind it out for a halve, that's the way this day has been.  Just your observations.
STEWART CINK:  It has been a very close day.  I don't think any match has finished yet more than 3&2.  So the teams are really evenly matched, as everyone probably expected.  And all of the matches are going down to the wire so it puts extra importance on trying to win a hole or two and then holding onto it.  It's tough to do because the firepower on both sides is really pretty impressive.
Q.  Does this team tonight go back to the team room and say, look, we good this far, we're not feeling that bad?
STEWART CINK:  I think today the reason that we didn't come out with two points more than their team is because our putts just weren't falling.  Generally, not many people on our team made anything outside of, you know, six or seven feet it seemed like.

I think tomorrow we're going to have to come out here and hopefully things are going to turn.  We're not going to force it.  Two points is not a huge deficit at this point in the game.  We'll come out with a different mindset.
Q.  Any difference between you in the morning and in the afternoon?  How is your feeling about your game?
STEWART CINK:  I played almost exactly the same, both morning and afternoon.  Felt pretty good all the way, and you know, I haven't won yet, but I haven't lost, either.
