 Q. A very tough day today out there. 4-under is a great score. 
 STEWART CINK: Thank you. Yeah, it was a difficult day. There was the wind was coming from all over the place and it was blowing pretty hard at time. It would gust really strong and then it would lay down. And you just -- not only did you have to hit the ball solid and make the right decision but you also had to catch the wind at the right moment. 
 And, overall, even par, I didn't feel like I gained a lot of ground, but in the end it looks like I may have.

 Q. It seemed like it was so tough to score out there. A lot of trouble getting the ball on the green?
 STEWART CINK: It was tough to putt because the wind was moving the ball around a little bit. With the speed of the greens you're already, there's already some level of indecision and then the wind just adds more. So it was tough to be very aggressive on the greens.

 Q. Were you surprised at the number of players dropping scores today?
 STEWART CINK: I wasn't because when you couple the Masters pressure and some of the difficult pin placements and the wind, just about anything can happen. It's a very difficult golf course when the wind's blowing like this.

 Q. A quick quote on the leader, Trevor, he could be the first South African since Gary Player to win. 
 STEWART CINK: It looks like he's on his way. He's played well all week and he's shown that he can handle the lead in tournaments from start to finish and he's done it this week and I think that he'll make a good champion. 

 Q. Happy with your play this week?
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, I think I learned a few things. I'm closer than ever probably to competing for the green jacket and it's hard to know that I have to wait 51 weeks to give it another shot, but I think I'll be back.
