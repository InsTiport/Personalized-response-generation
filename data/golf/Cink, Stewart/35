Q.   Just overall comments about the week.   We talked to you a lot this week.   You were feeling pretty good.   Put yourself in great position.   Kind of general overall comments about the week.
STEWART CINK:   I'm excited about my overall play.   You know, I would have liked -- I would like to be a little bit more -- well, I don't know how to say it, but I was a little tentative out there on the front-9 today on the putting.   I hit it -- I had to scrap about the first four -- four holes and made some good saves for pars, but then I really felt very comfortable with my ball striking once we got to 5 for some reason.   I kind of rediscovered something and calmed down. 
Then I couldn't make any birdie putts.   5, 6, 7, 8, 9 I had some really good chances on the holes and didn't make a one.   That part of the golf course really cost me.   And then when I finally got my act together and made birdies on 11, 12 and then 15 after the delay, there was just a couple too many guys ahead of me and I just, you know, I would have to make some serious heroics on the last couple holes and wasn't able to do it.

Q.   Was there something specific you kind of discovered that clicked?
STEWART CINK:   Mechanically, I don't need to go into the details, but mechanically I was just a little, I think, anxious on the range and on the first few holes.   I was just, you know, probably a little bit of lack of being there recently in that situation and the wind was blowing and there was a lot of difficult shots early on. 
So, once I got to 5, I don't know where it clicked or what, but on 5 I just kind of regained a little bit of calmness and got back to what we're doing, doing what we're doing all week and the last couple of months and get going and, you know, I motivated myself and played pretty good golf after that.   Just wasn't quite enough.

Q.   Lastly, talking about the motivation, what do you take moving forward from here with the game?
STEWART CINK:   Little bits and pieces of being in contention and performing fairly well under the gun when time is expiring.   When you're not in that position for awhile, you kind of forget what it feels like when the juices really flow and sometimes you kind of tend to think that you wonder if I could do it again. 
And so here, Humana, even at Tampa a few weeks ago, I got within a couple strokes with a few holes to play, and, you know, it's good to see some performance during those stages when you're nervous and excited and amped up and still see some good shots some good putts.   All in all, just about sort of relearning being in that position.
