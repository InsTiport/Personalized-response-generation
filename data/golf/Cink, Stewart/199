Q.
Chris has really been playing some good golf.  He hasn't played well on the West Coast, but he has this week?
STEWART CINK:  He plays the kind of game that you need to have success in this tournament this week.  He hits the ball in the fairway.  I think he only missed one fairway all day.  And I missed about three and maybe four, and that was the difference.  The holes where I was out of the fairway were just    you're fighting to tie those holes, instead of having a chance to win.  And it really came down to that.
Q.  On 17 it looked pretty much like a hole out there on your third shot to keep the match going.
STEWART CINK:  Yeah, I figured I would, because leaving the match up to a guy like Chris DiMarco, three putt is not the ideal scenario, uphill.  But that was just kind of the way my day was.  I didn't play quite as well today as I have earlier in the matches.

But I can't be too disappointed.  Losing stinks, but at least I chose the quarterfinals to lose instead of the first round.
