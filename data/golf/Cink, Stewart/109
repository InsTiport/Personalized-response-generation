   STEWART CINK: They both have this ability to focus in on the task. You know, the golf shot in front of them, whether it's on Wednesday for a charity fun day, I guess, or whether it's on Sunday of a major championship. They both just lock in. It's like a radar lock on the shot and what they have to do. It's challenging for Jack.   
 To hit these fairways like this, he had to hit a good drive to get to the fairway, and he hit everything. Pretty impressive. I guess he missed one on the 13th.   
 Just seeing him lock in is very reminiscent of what you see Tiger do when he needs to lock in.   
  
  Q. Did you ever imagine the last couple of years you'd get to play with Jack and Tiger at the same time?   
 STEWART CINK: I can't say I ever thought about that. But, no, it never crossed my mind as something that I would be doing at some point. I really didn't think I was going to be doing it here until Anthony Kim pulled out. And then I got in. So I was the beneficiary of him deciding not to play. Cool day. I really enjoyed it.   
  
  Q. As a golf fan, what does it mean to you to play with Tiger and Jack?   
 STEWART CINK: Well, as a golf fan, some of my favorite memories from golf are from those two guys. Jack winning the Masters was sort of like the big thing that got me into golf. I really wasn't a big follower of pro golf until Jack's win at the Masters in '86.   
 And then when Tiger won the Masters in '97, it was my first Masters. To see him do that, the golf fan in me really thought that was pretty much -- it blew me away. Those two guys represent the bulk of my memories as a golf fan. To get to play with them and see it up close. I've seen Tiger a lot more than Jack. It was pretty neat.   
  
  Q. As a golf professional, anything surprise you anymore that these guys do?   
 STEWART CINK: Well, yeah.
