 Q. Stewart, two years ago at Royal Montreal you secured the win for the Americans and today you scored the first point in singles; must be very satisfying for you?
 STEWART CINK: It is very satisfying. To come back yesterday afternoon where I really played horrible, and to come out and play more like myself, it feels great and I'm just proud to earn a point. 

 Q. What turned around specifically? Your ball-striking was phenomenal. Was there something that clicked for you? 
 STEWART CINK: I think yesterday afternoon, the two rounds in one day, and add that up with all my matches going to the 18th hole and being real nail-biters, I think I just ran out of gas yesterday and I just needed some rest. 
 I came out today and just forgot about that and went back to doing what I was doing and I hit the ball very well today. 
 It feels great. I told the captains yesterday that I wanted to go out early because I wanted to go ahead and erase yesterday afternoon's bad round out as quickly as I could, and I've liked my positions in the past in these events going out early. And so I got my wish. That maybe puts a little more pressure to get that early point, but it felt good to go out and play my normal game again and make a ton of birdies. 

 Q. You play a lot more good golf than you did playing bad golf this week, you didn't see anything out of it the first couple of days, but today getting that bad round out had to feel great. 
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, you know, you can say that I might have won some matches with the way I played the first couple of rounds, but you know, we played against some guys that just played their butts off, too. It did feel really good today, really satisfying to go out and have the fruits of your labor turn into a point instead of a halve or a loss.
