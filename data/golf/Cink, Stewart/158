   STEWART CINK:  I just love playing here, something about this place.  It's pretty obvious, I guess, why everybody loves playing here.  The golf course is in really nice shape and it's a challenge.  It definitely weeds out the players who are really playing well from the ones who are not.  You can struggle around here. 

 Q.  You're in that group, but there's a lot of guys in that group right now.  It's going to be an interesting Saturday finish here. 
 STEWART CINK:  Yeah, it'll be a tight one tomorrow, I'm sure.  The way the course has played this week, there's been very little wind.  The ball has been rolling pretty good on the fairways, but the greens have been really receptive.  Overall I think it's been a recipe for the lowest score average that we've seen in quite a while, and that leads to a tightly-bunched leaderboard, so it'll be an exciting day, I think, for the fans. 

 Q.  With all of your great memories here and good finishes here, is this your time tomorrow?  Do you feel like you've got something going that you need to capitalize on tomorrow? 
 STEWART CINK:  You'll have to ask me that tomorrow after the round.  Today was my day, but tomorrow, who knows?  The way the game of golf is, I feel like I'm thinking pretty well on the course and I'm staying pretty patient, which are two things you have to do around here.  So I'm looking forward to the challenge. 

 Q.  65, why was it your day?  What do you get going out there? 
 STEWART CINK:  You know, every day through seven holes I've been at least 3-under, and the first two days I just gave them back.  I finished -- I think I was 4-under through 7 the first day and finished 3, and I hadn't made a birdie past No. 7 yet in the tournament until today.  That was one of my goals actually, keep the accelerator pressed down and not to rest at all.  I really felt good on my putting on the back nine today and made some nice putts, a good par save on 16, threw in a three-putt for par on 15, so that was disappointed.  But overall I felt really good on the putting and knocked in a good little birdie on the last hole there, and it moved me up a little bit more. 

 Q.  A lot of guys talk about a course fits their eye.  Does it have to fit your eye to play well? 
 STEWART CINK:  Well, it makes it a lot easier if it fits your eye.  I think that's a vague phrase, too.  I think if you play well here year after year, then it fits your eye a little bit more.  I know when I first started playing in the Memorial back in the mid-'90s, I thought it was one of the most difficult courses I had ever played.  The bunkers were really deep, the pin placements were tucked, and I wasn't used to that type of golf.  It took me a couple years to get comfortable playing here to where I felt like I didn't have to aim at every pin placement, I didn't have to attack so much.  I could take my time and pick my choices on being aggressive, and it led to steadily higher finishes in the tournament until now I feel like I've got -- not a great track record, having never won this tournament, but I feel like I'm pretty comfortable on the golf course, and I know what to expect out of it. 

 Q.  How different is the mindset when you go into a Sunday in a position like you're going to be in one of the last groups, especially at this point? 
 STEWART CINK:  Well, that's what you -- that's the challenge tomorrow is that you try to take the mindset exactly how it is on the third round or the first round for that matter.  You know, the golf ball doesn't know any different and your clubs sure don't know any different.  For me, I'll be challenged to go out there tomorrow and stay in the present and take it one shot at a time.  I know that's a boring old clich√© in golf, but it really pays the bills, too.  That will be my focus for tomorrow, just to stay in the moment.
