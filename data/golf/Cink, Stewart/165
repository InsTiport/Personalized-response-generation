  Q.  On the course conditions.   

 STEWART CINK:  It wasn't very easy again.  It was almost like a bonus round today.  (Yesterday he didn't think he'd be here.) Cold doesn't bother me.   
  
  Q.  Greens.   

 STEWART CINK:  Totally changed character from first hole to the last hole.  By the end of the day there were barely any pitch marks.  When the wind picks up, you almost close your eyes.  It's baffling on 11 and 12.  It (wind) changes direction.   
  
  Q.  Easter.   

 STEWART CINK:  It matters to me because I'm a Christian.  My daughter's birthday is tomorrow.  It's a big day.  Masters Sunday, Easter and 10th birthday.  It was colder today.   
  
  Q.  Reference to the back pin location.   

 STEWART CINK:  It's not easier because you have to judge the shelf on the green.   

 The first hole may have been a little easier (back pin.)   
  Q.  Easter.   

 STEWART CINK:  If nothing else, it helps me stay calm.  No one will be unscathed here.  You fee like you're throwing away a lot of shots, when you really aren't.   

 Thought they watered the greens overnight.  Huge pitch marks.  A lot slower.  They were a lot slower until the latter part of the back nine.
