  Q. Nice round today.   
 STEWART CINK: Thanks.  
  
  Q. What do you think it takes going into tomorrow when you look at the scoreboard and you're six shots back?  
 STEWART CINK: Well, I think for someone in my position, probably I'll need to have the golf course set up with birdies in mind like they typically do on Sundays and also some pretty nervous leaders (laughter), and I need to play aggressively and hopefully just pick them off as they come.   
 Really all you can do is just try to do your best and see where you end up around 14 or 15 and then you just kind of go for broke. Hopefully I'll be in that position where I have to decide.   
  
  Q. It looks like you'll be playing with Tiger. What is that going to be like on Sunday at The Masters?   
 STEWART CINK: I don't know if I've ever played with him on Sunday here before, but I've played with him plenty of times here, and this year I've played with him a few times on Sunday.   
 He's good to play with. I've always enjoyed it, and I always say if you're playing with him on the weekend, you're doing something right.  
  
  Q. What's going right for you this week?  
 STEWART CINK: I've been striking the ball real well all week. I feel like my rhythm has been really good, and I've been playing the right shot most of the time. I haven't -- with a few exceptions, I haven't really made mistakes with my judgment, and that's one of the hardest things to do around here is to judge everything just right.  
  
  Q. How much of a support system do you have going around here, being a guy who lives in Atlanta?   
 STEWART CINK: Well, every hole out here I hear the Georgia Tech calls and the state of Georgia calls, not the University of Georgia really. But I feel a lot of support, and I think that people that live around here and live in Atlanta would love to see somebody from their town win.  
  
  Q. What kind of Georgia Tech calls do you hear?  
 STEWART CINK: I just hear a lot of "Go Jackets." There's more Tech fans than I thought.  
  
  Q. And what does the sand save at the last do for your confidence overnight?  
 STEWART CINK: Well, you know, it doesn't hurt, for sure. It wasn't that difficult of a shot to get it within six or seven feet of the hole, but it was a hard shot to get within a foot. I played it well, and you could easily fat it and leave it right there on the lip and have it come back right to where your shot was. I was happy to get up-and-down with a par there, and luckily the second shot didn't cost me.  
  
  Q. You're optimistic about tomorrow?  
 STEWART CINK: Why not? I'm kind of in a position where I have nothing to lose. I've been out here long enough where I'm not playing to try to finish 10th or 4th or 11th or anything like that, I'm just trying to see how high I can get up on the leaderboard, and if it goes the other way, it goes the other way.
