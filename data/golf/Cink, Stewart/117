 Q. Obviously, a couple of day marathons, lots of holes, I don't know if it's the most played, but you must be worn out. 
 STEWART CINK: Well, yeah, I'm tired, but when you're that close in your matches, 1-up and 1-down, you never were more than one hole separated, today or yesterday, the adrenaline's always right there. So you don't really feel tired until after you get back to the hotel, maybe relax a little bit. 
 So I don't feel it right now. But I need to conserve my energy, because this thing, as I know from last year, goes on for a long time. 

 Q. Have you seen the bracket? Who have you got next round?
 STEWART CINK: I got Mickelson.

 Q. Well that's got to be a pretty good match, there's going to be a lot of interest in that. 
 STEWART CINK: Well, I don't think I've ever played him in a match, but obviously with his game and what he's done, he just won last week, he's doing a lot of things right. 
 He has the ability to play really bad for a little while and then just play as well as anybody in the world. So who knows what's going to happen, I just hope I have a decent game of my own tomorrow.

 Q. You just have to keep paying attention all the time. 
 STEWART CINK: Yeah.
