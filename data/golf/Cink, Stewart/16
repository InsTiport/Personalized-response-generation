Q. Stewart, hearing the news about Jay passing away.  Just talk a little bit what he meant to that tournament and then also to you guys as players.
STEWART CINK: Well, I think, first of all, he positioned Travelers as a leader in the sponsorship arena on the PGA TOUR because Travelers really brands that tournament very, very well and Jay was a huge part of that.
I know he was a huge proponent of getting involved in golf on the PGA TOUR.  We really certainly appreciate that.  But I got to play golf with Jay and I know he was enthusiastic about playing golf and about being a part of golf and about spreading the values of golf and using Travelers and making it such a good relationship.
So, I'm really saddened to hear the news today.
Q. The fact that they had the dinner this year that raised 1.1 million and I think he gave millions of his own money to ALS research, it's a cruel disease.  He fought hard, though.
STEWART CINK: He did.  When guys like Jay are really visible in the public -- and we're going through our own battle right now at our house, we know a lot about battling and visibility and it's really hard to hear but I know what kind heart Jay had and it was a really good heart and I was proud to say that I knew him and proud to say that he was associated with the PGA TOUR.
