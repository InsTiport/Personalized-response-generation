  STEWART CINK:   Mostly a solid round except for the first tee ball was horrendous.   I hit a big old hook off the tee and it went in the pond.   Made bogey there.   The rest of the round was very clean and lot of good -- lot of really good shots from the fairway and then capitalized on the par-5s.  
   
 Q.   What was happening today?  
STEWART CINK:   You know, every day is a little bit different.   You just come out here with a good attitude and positive thoughts and try to just do what you've worked on.   Some days it works out great and other days you go back to the drawing board and reprogram.   Days like today felt really good.   I really didn't get myself into a lot of trouble.   I think I had a pretty good score.  
   
 Q.   Coming in this afternoon, do you think they'll get finished?  
STEWART CINK:   It's nice to get your rounds finished without delays.   Delays today will affect us tomorrow.   So I hope that the weather moves around us or it doesn't appear to have, and I'm sure the fans would also like that.
