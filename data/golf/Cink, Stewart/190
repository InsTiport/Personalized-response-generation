Q.  We are here with the United States Team, Zach Johnson and Stewart Cink.  Guys, obviously tough day, the conditions, talk about the alternate shot format?

STEWART CINK:  That's tough already, and then you have a little bit more wind and cooler temperatures and some rain mixed in; the scoring is usually not very low in this format.

But you look at Team Argentina and they just blitzed this place.  And I don't know if they played a different set of tees than we did or what, but they made it look easy.
Q.  Is this the first time you've actually played alternate shot in competition?  Obviously you don't play a lot of that back in the States, was this the first time for you?

ZACH JOHNSON:  Yes, it was and I love it.  We practiced with it nine holes this week, and I just think it's fun.  You don't want to pay too much attention to    I'm saying you don't really want to put too much pressure on yourself.  You still have to play within yourself and hit your own shots, rather than worry about what they are going to do next or where to put them, which sometimes I probably should have thought more of.  But anyway, I enjoyed it.
Q.  You brought your wives over, Lisa and Kim, what are they doing here?  Obviously it's a beautiful area; what are the wives doing this week?

STEWART CINK:  Took them about two hours to finish berating us after yesterday, after all of the mistakes we made.  Between watching us play this tournament and then giving us the business after the round's over, that's pretty much a full day.
