  Q. How did it feel out there?  
 STEWART CINK: It was the hottest it's been so far this week, especially the first six holes were really hot because it was so humid and no breeze at all. And the course really hasn't changed since yesterday. It's been kind of the same. I think this course will stay pretty much the same all week. But I'm pretty happy being under par. It's a tough course.  
  
  Q. There's no surprises out there as far as what you expect?   
 STEWART CINK: Well, I think the only surprise was a lot of the tees were moved around. Some of the tees were moved up quite a bit, so you had to think a little bit about your line off the tee and maybe what club to hit. Some holes that -- overall, other than that there weren't any surprises.  
  
  Q. How would you characterize the final four holes?   
 STEWART CINK: Well, we play some pretty tough stretches on finishing holes, but the one thing about here is that the 17th hole is like the breather hole now. It used to be like one of the hardest par-3s I've ever seen, and it's a 200-yard carry over water with a wall in front of the green. Just relative to the other holes, though, 16 and 18 are just bears, and 15, of course, everyone knows that's 260 with water right there, too, so there's no let-up from 14 in.  
  
  Q. Kind of a tough stretch in the middle part of your first nine. How did you get things turned around?  
 STEWART CINK: I just kept plugging. Today was a pretty decent round out there. By no means was it really where I wanted to end up. But overall I was proud of myself the way I hung in there. But yeah, I guess I'm trending the right way.  
  
  Q. Could you describe the final four holes?   
 STEWART CINK: Well, they're just brutal. There's no let-up. They're long, and you've got to hit the fairways. If you don't hit the fairways you're swimming upstream. And they're not very wide. Very demanding stretch.  
  
  Q. What did you hit off 15 today?  
 STEWART CINK: 3-iron.  
  
  Q. Did you hit the green?  
 STEWART CINK: I hit the green. I was about 25 feet.  
  
  Q. Knowing you have those final four holes coming up, is there any part of you that tries to press a little bit harder on kind of the first part of the nine?  
 STEWART CINK: No, because if you start trying to -- if you start emphasizing other holes, those opportunities, they're just going to bite you. Even the easy holes out here are going to be -- there's going to be bogeys and doubles on them. It's just not an easy golf course anywhere, but then 14 through 18 are a little bit more severe. But you can't focus on -- you can't try to emphasize any other holes.  
  
  Q. What's the odometer?  
 STEWART CINK: From my house? Eight.  
  
  Q. Could be anywhere from like 15 minutes to an hour and a half?  
 STEWART CINK: On most days it's about 30 minutes. Today there was no traffic.   
  
  Q. Other than the added length, how is this course playing compared to years past for you?  
 STEWART CINK: Well, the added length is inconsequential compared to the change in the grass on the greens. That's the biggest change. The greens just are not soft like they used to be. They're relatively soft today, but the way they were back in 2001, there's nothing like that. They were bentgrass then and they were soft and they had to keep them alive, and now the grass is just thriving. It's got tons of root structure and anything coming in with no spin or out of the rough is just going to roll right through the back edge.  
  
  Q. Can you go through your birdies real quick?  
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, 10 starting off the day out of the fairway bunker hit it about six feet with an 8-iron.   
 12, I plugged my tee ball in a fairway bunker and had to just chip it basically 20 yards down the fairway and hit 5-iron about three feet, birdie there.   
 And then I didn't -- I don't think I made another birdie until No. 4. I hit a 5-iron about eight feet.   
 5, I two-putted, driver, 3-wood from 40 feet.   
 And 6, I hit a wedge.
