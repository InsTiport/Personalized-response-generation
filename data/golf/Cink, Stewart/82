   STEWART CINK: You have a match play tournament like this, you have people from all over the world, you see a lot more of the Sean O'Hairs and Zach Johnson and Luke Donalds of the world than you do have other parts of the globe.
 But everybody plays well and you just have to buckle down and focus on what you're doing, and you kind of forget about the social aspect.

 Q. When you see some of the big names, what runs through your mind when you're playing?
 STEWART CINK: No, you don't even pay one bit of attention. This is not the Big Dance. This is 1 through 1 A. Everybody is so close and even in this field that there's no George Mason in this thing. 18 holes is not enough really to separate, you know, the pedigree of golfers. 

 Q. That was a brawl out there today, wasn't it?
 STEWART CINK: It was a battle. We knew it would be. Sean is a real feisty competitor. And he's a great player. He's got a lot of skills. He just never is going to back down. I knew it was going to be a tough fight. 
 I played similar to the way I did yesterday. I didn't have everything going on the front nine, but I played much better on the back. And it was enough. 

 Q. You told me the other day you need a little luck in this format. You made your own luck, especially on the backside?
 STEWART CINK: Absolutely. I wouldn't say that the par saves I made were the turning point, especially the one on 7 and the one on 10, I wouldn't call it a turning point, it was just keeping me in the fight. It kept me within shouting distance, at least, because I was 2-down. 
 But, yeah, sometimes you do that and it works away on your opponent a little bit. And I made a couple of birdies after that and got some confidence and played really well the last seven or eight holes. 

 Q. Well, done, you're in the final 16.
