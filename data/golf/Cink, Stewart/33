Q.  Talk about the day.  You got off to a good start.
STEWART CINK:  Yeah, it was a good start, 2-under through
the first nine is good.  But then I just hit a couple of crooked
tee balls on the last nine, where hitting the bunker two times and
it went straight sideways, and a couple shots from the rough that
I couldn't control and made some bogeys.
It wasn't anything -- I'm not looking back saying, why
did I do that?  You're going to make some bogeys.  The golf course
is playing easy and it's playing tough at the same time.  If you
miss the fairways, you've got a lot of work to do because of the
guessing that has to happen with all the roll you're getting,
especially from the rough with a flier.  You almost have no idea
how far you're going to hit it.
And the greens were picking up speed.  I couldn't believe
how fast they were toward the end of the day.  I three-putted on
14, I had about a 35, 40-foot putt and I hit it 15 feet past.  And
everything on the back nine was just racing past the hole.  So in
the afternoon I don't think they're going to get any slower.
Q.  Is the breeze just enough to make you have to think about
it and dry the greens?
STEWART CINK:  It's the perfect amount of breeze, really.
I was walking up the 17th hole thinking, I don't know if I've ever
had this much fun playing a course in a tournament that meant so
much.  It's so much fun out there.  Every shot is like a chess
match.  It's exactly what links ought to be, really.
The wind is up about maybe 10 miles an hour, but it's
just enough to make you think about your club selection and your
trajectories and your curves.  It's beautiful.  The course is
absolutely perfect.
