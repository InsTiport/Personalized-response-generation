Q.  Stewart, why don't we talk about your birdies, get that out of the way?  

STEWART CINK:  Okay.  I got off to a good start today.  I hit it close on two, about three feet.  


Q.  What club did you hit? 

STEWART CINK:  L wedge.  Number three I hit an eight iron about ten feet.  Four, I hit -- I was in the rough off the tee, and I had a chip.  Let's see, where was I?  Right of the green.  I chipped in from right of the green just out of the fairway, little fairway area.  Six I hit a sand wedge to about 12 feet.  And 15 I think is the only other birdie I made.  15, I drove it up there about just a couple yards off the edge of the green, had an easy chip and chipped it about a foot from the hole.  


Q.  How far was the chip? 

STEWART CINK:  The chip was only about 20 feet.  The pin was on the front right and I was on the front right. 


Q.  Has the course played any differently this year than over last year? 

STEWART CINK:  Night and day difference.  Last year we had rain and winds in the first two days.  This year the rain and wind came early and now the course is soft and the winds died down.  It's nice and warm.  Perfect scoring conditions.  Last year I remember it being pretty difficult the first two days, windy, cool rain.  This year, night and day.  Last year on the weekend I remember it being more like this.  


Q.  The way the weather has been, you think the players' expectations over the next two days will be that the course is going to still be soft? 

STEWART CINK:  Definitely.  I think everyone has an attacking mentality right now and they know if you don't make birdies and you don't shoot about four or five under, you're going to get passed.  Everyone knows you'll have to do at least that to stay where you are.  


Q.  It wouldn't surprise you to see some kind of super-low score at the end of four days, breaking the record?  

STEWART CINK:  No I said it earlier in the week.  When I saw it raining Tuesday I said the tournament record was probably going to say bye-bye.  It's looking like that's going to happen.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's better than 15 under, not at all.  I think you've seen some low rounds today, and if it doesn't dry out a lot, the low rounds are going to continue.  


Q.  How are you playing the last year? 

STEWART CINK:  Compared to last year, I think I probably played a little better the first two days than I did last year.  It's hard to say.  It's a year difference, but tee to green I've been great this week so far, I haven't missed many fairways at all.  I putted for a lot of birdies.  Actually I've not made much, to be eight under, I've not made that many putts.  


Q.  Stewart, as the defending champ here, are the people with you, have you noticed out there?  

STEWART CINK:  I noticed the comments from the crowd.  I've noticed that everyone recognizes me and they remember last year, and I've had a lot of positive things said.  


Q.  You haven't got close to the hill on 17, have you? 

STEWART CINK:  No.  No, I'd rather hit it in the water.  


Q.  Then you'd be in the fairway for the second shot?  

STEWART CINK:  Yeah. 

Q.  Where have you been yesterday? 

STEWART CINK:  17 yesterday I hit in the fairway  and I hit a five iron on the green, made birdie.  I hit in the left rough, not that big rough, just off the fairway.  Hit a seven iron 15 feet, two putt.  I played it more like it's designed to play.  


Q.  How many bogies yesterday?  

STEWART CINK:  I bogied number ten my first hole. 


Q.  You bogied your first hole and not since? 

STEWART CINK:  Yeah.  35 par or better, not bad.  


Q.  Okay.  Anymore questions for Stewart?  Thank you.  

STEWART CINK:  Thanks.
