 Q. Ran into the 5 and 4 machine in Paul Casey?
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, I was trying my best all day to try to avoid being a victim to that four again to him. 
 He played really well today and I didn't play as well as I did the first three matches. That explains the score.

 Q. What about the conditions out there?
 STEWART CINK: In match play the conditions don't really affect me, because it's just you against the other guy. It was definitely colder and quite a bit breezier. But everyone has to deal with the same thing and it's really not that much of a factor.

 Q. You said you didn't play as well, was there something in particular?
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, definitely. I let a few shots go around the greens, some putts -- I missed a couple of putts that were good putts that didn't go in the hole and I tried to make the putts rather than trying to go through my normal routine. Once you get out of your normal routine, that's not the kind of mentality you want to be in, especially when you're a few holes down.

 Q. You mentioned when you were four down you learned something about that, did that come back into your head today?
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, certainly, I tried to draw on the other day when I came back. And I felt like I was playing well, but I just -- when I put myself in position to make a putt to either win or tie a hole, I wasn't able to convert them.
