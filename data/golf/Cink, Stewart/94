 Q. How did you mess up your back?
 STEWART CINK: I messed it up yesterday on the range. I just have been so perturbed with myself the way I've been playing this week and last week that I've been working a little bit harder and trying to do things like fix my posture, and I think yesterday I overdid it with my posture, and my back sort of rebelled today. I woke up with some soreness and tried to get it ironed out. 

 Q. You said on 6 you saw an electronic leaderboard that tells you your projected ranking?
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, normally I would never look at those projected things. It's subjective to what everybody else is doing. So there's no point in looking at that and seeing where you stand at the moment because you don't know what the other players are doing. Two guys may have tap-ins for birdie somewhere and they haven't putted in yet. 
 So I saw it and it got in my head a little bit, and I wish I hadn't seen it because that's not really what I needed to have in my mind at that moment.

 Q. You said you were just trying to play the best you could, but do you have a number --
 STEWART CINK: No.

 Q. You didn't have a number in mind?
 STEWART CINK: There's no number. There's no such thing as a number on this course because it's a new place. For all intents and purposes it's a new track. We don't know how it's going to react. We don't know the pins. The golf course is playing pretty tough today. So to come out with some kind of a number in mind would have been pointless.

 Q. Thumbs up at the whole concept of having to be Top 30 to make it? Is that more stress than it needs to be, or do you like the drama?
 STEWART CINK: It's certainly stressful if you're in with these other guys that are fighting it out. It needs to be; that's what makes our sport compelling. There's leader stress, there's cut stress, there's who's going to make the TOUR Championship, who's going to make The Presidents Cup and the Ryder Cup. There's all kinds of stress at different levels. You have to sort of experience that and deal with it to be professional and be successful.

 Q. What would you go to the TOUR Championship hopeful of doing, outside of winning the tournament, FedEx related? 
 STEWART CINK: Well, I mean, the planets will have to align for me to probably win the whole thing at this point. But I would like to just go in there and try to win in front of my home crowd. That would be great, and improve my record. I don't have a great record there.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEWART CINK: It broke left to right early and then it kind of straightened out. It was actually not a very hard putt to make. It was just the situation, that I needed to make one. It had to go in pretty much.

 Q. Can you compare it to Turnberry, the pressure?
 STEWART CINK: No, the physical characteristics of the putt were the same. It was downhill, and I needed to make it. Actually I felt a little bit more nervous coming in here than I did there because there I felt like I had nothing to lose and everything to gain, and here I felt like I had everything to lose.

 Q. I know that you say you don't look at the projections, but did you know that you had dropped below 30 going into this round?
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, I did know that. I glanced at the board now and then, and I don't ignore them and I don't stare at them, but I did see that I was 33rd starting the day. I saw that. 

 Q. Did you do some work with Chris on your back? Does he have any idea?
 STEWART CINK: Yeah, this morning we worked on it a little bit. It got me a little bit late starting. But it's just something that's not going to go away for a few days probably. I don't know what I did to it exactly.
