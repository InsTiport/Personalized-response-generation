 STEWART CINK:  I had the tees in mind back from a few years ago from my college days.  I was relying on that.  I feel like I'm able to play.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  I lost about 35 pounds. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  I just stopped eating like a pig.  I just decided to stop being such a pig. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK: You hate to finish with a bogey and especially with a bogey at 18.  You hate to finish with two in a row.  So it was nice to get that one to go. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  It was a little wet out there at times.  We had to deal with some rain and the umbrellas were out part of the way but really the course was more receptive today.  Less wind.  I don't feel -- I felt as -- I don't feel like I played as well today as I did yesterday.  But anything under par here you feel good about. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  I don't know.  I really wasn't out here in the morning so I don't know how windy it was.  But it all evens out.  And the guys that are going out this afternoon had their umbrellas out and some of those holes played a little longer with the rain. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  I wouldn't say I found anything.  I just settled down and I was able to -- I hit the ball really well all day.  I lipped out some birdies.  And I just couldn't get many putts to fall today.  And I think really the only difference today was that I didn't make any bombs and I missed a couple fairways and it cost me. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  I feel great.  I feel like I'm in control off the tee again and I haven't felt that way in a little while.  So it feels good to stand up on the tee and look at some targets and see my ball headed that way.  And I feel a lot of confidence off the tee and I'm hitting the ball close to the hole from the fairway.  So I just need to get my putter going.  And I haven't really heated it up yet.  But maybe this weekend it will get warm. 

Q.  This is a place with the wider fairways so you can get the confidence going off the tee.  It's just open.  And is that a positive mindset?
STEWART CINK:  Not only the wider fairways but also the fact that the fairways are set up for a certain type of shot.  And a lot of times you have some bunkers out there where you want to move the ball off of or just really nice looks off the tee.  And I feel comfortable teeing off with my ball here.  And I think that has a lot to do with it. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  Well, 10-under is leading right now so if the weather, if it stays wet, I believe it's supposed to stay wet, then anywhere 17- to 18-under par.  Somebody will go out there and light it up.  The greens are in beautiful shape and everybody is going to have some birdie putts.  I felt like I was 3-under par just by virtue of hitting the ball great.  And giving myself a lot of short birdie putts.  And then I missed the fairway on 17 and I didn't hit a very good fairway bunker shot.  I shorted the green and that was really a tough place to be.  I bogeyed there and I felt like I needed to make a par on 18.

Q.  You said 17 or 18-under will win.  Do you feel like you can do that?
STEWART CINK:  I feel like I can do it.  All I need to do is get my putter warmed up and stay warm and relaxed and give myself a chance.  I feel like I'm hitting the ball well enough to do it. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEWART CINK:  I don't want to sound too bold about that.  But I just feel like I've been a consistent player.  But I'm tired of being labeled as a consistent player.  I want to be a guy that can win.  I've only won two tournaments out here and I feel like I've had my share, my chance to win more.

Q.  What is your favorite post-round snack?  What would you like?  Does it make any difference to you?
STEWART CINK:  I like those little frozen Snickers.  I'm really a big sweet tooth.
