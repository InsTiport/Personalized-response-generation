JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Thank you, Stewart for joining us for a few minutes.  Excellent round today of 65, 10-under for the tournament.  Give us a couple comments about your round and we'll go into questions.
STEWART CINK:   Well, I played today like I've been playing for a few months now.  Been putting the ball in play off the tee and really confident off the tee and putting well, too, so that's a good combination, really, no matter where you go.  I just really didn't play mistake-free.  I 3-putted the hole and bogeyed on the front nine.  I left a few par 5 opportunities out there, so it was a good round mixed in with a little bit of bad but I'm not complaining at all. 

Q.  You're the leader now, but it's just like a roller coaster ride, you're the leader now and then the next five minutes, you're not the leader; does that bother you or do you really care?
STEWART CINK:   Not at this time.  You don't worry about who is in the lead till Sunday and then you start to think about it some.  The first two days you're early/late or late/early.  I think 10-under par will be around the lead.  I don't think it will be in the lead but I don't expect anyone to shoot a whole lot lower than that this afternoon.  I've put myself in position where I can catch whoever goes a little bit lower than that.

Q.  How much does winning this in the past figure into your confidence level coming here?
STEWART CINK:   Well, it doesn't hurt.  You have to be pretty comfortable coming back here after winning here.  It's been three years now but I still feel really good on these greens and off the tees, everything looks really good to my eye.  There's a lot of confidence just from those things.  And then knowing that you've actually completed the task here in the past and drawing from those memories, it also adds confidence. 

Q.  Has the restoration made any difference from 2000 until playing now? 
STEWART CINK:   You know, it really has not made that much difference.  It's one of the best restoration jobs I've ever seen done on any course.  They did such a great job, mainly because they didn't change anything.  They restored the 14th back to it's original design and made it a little longer and they added a tee box on 3 and as far as I remember that might be all.  Everything else is the same.  The greens are just as good as ever.  It's challenging, just like always, and they really did a great job.

Q.  How are you playing now, this year, compared to the way you were playing in 2000 when you came in here; do you recall?
STEWART CINK:   Gosh, that's a long time ago.  I don't really recall how it was played.  I remember I played in the Masters the week before that year and I remember playing pretty well but not scoring well and I remember playing with Tiger Woods three straight days that year.  His caddie told me that he thought I was playing really well and I was due for a win.  I remember that.  And I won the next tournament, so I guess; no, matter what Tiger says on TV about him.  (Laughter.)
I really don't remember my stretch of tournaments coming into that 2000 year.  I must have been playing okay. 

Q.  You've had several good finishes this year; do you feel like you're due any week or do you push yourself in that direction?
STEWART CINK:   I don't feel like I'm due because being  -- you know, I don't really see it in that light.  What I think is that I'm doing things in my game that I really am proud of right now.  It's something that I've tried to work towards for the last two or three years and I really have played poorly for the last two years now, up until last two or three months.  I'm pretty much ecstatic to be hitting the ball where I want to and putting the ball well. 
I don't really feel like I'm necessarily due to win but I feel like I'm able to win.  That's the way I like to see it.

Q.  What's the difference? 
STEWART CINK:   Well, I've really  -- I went through a stretch where I was just playing with a lot of fear and very tentative.  Part of that probably had to do with making my first Ryder Cup team and having that delay for a whole year.  That was on our minds a little bit. 
Then some other  -- there's a lot of stuff that I was dealing with, but instead of just trying to push all that away, I really took a look at it and examined myself and I learned a lot about myself over the last six or seven months and it's helped me play quite a bit.  A lot more piece of mind and I'm able to see golf for what it really is, and that's a golf ball.  The ball doesn't care.  The ball doesn't care who you are or what you are. 
It's just been a lot easier for me to play and have a good time out on the course.

Q.  Sounds like maturity to me. 
STEWART CINK:   You could say it's maturity. 
I'm getting old out here.  I used to be one of the youngest players and now there's probably 50 guys that are younger than me playing this tour now.  It probably is a little bit of maturity, but for me personally, I know what it was and I know what I've worked on and how hard I've worked to try to overcome some of these things.  I'm just going to keep it kind of personal. 
It's been something that I've really been proud of looking straight in the eye and overcoming some of the problems I was having, and I just feel like learning this much about myself has given me a chance to perform more or near my potential and it's showing here this week.

Q.  It sounds like you really don't want to talk about it but can you give us a general idea of what you're talking about? 
STEWART CINK:   I'm not going to be too specific because you guys don't have time for me to sit here and tell you everything. 
What it basically is, it's the way fear creeps into your head when you're playing golf and the way that fear affects your confidence level.  It's more than just golf but it's just your personality and your confidence in life.  That's really the core of it. 
A lot of people out here on TOUR that help guys from a mental standpoint would say take your fearful thoughts and your anxieties and shut them away and let your pre-shot routine take over the place in your mind where those bad thoughts were.  Instead of going in that direction I've gone a step further and tried to figure out where all of it is coming from.  So that's basically what I've been doing and I'm still working on it.  It's not something that you have broken and it's fixed, but it's a long road of improvement and understanding. 

Q.  Were there times while you were going through this where, I don't know, you didn't want to step out on the golf course and play golf? 
STEWART CINK:   Well, a year ago, I used to come to tournaments, and I was playing poorly, I was putting poorly, driving the ball all over the place.  It's really a miracle that I finished 73 on the Money List last year because I was just playing pretty bad. 
Would I come to the golf tournaments and I would actually dread Thursdays.  Dread Thursdays, because I had to go out there and go through all this stuff.  And now, I look forward to Thursdays to the point where I don't even think there's a point  -- it's just the night and day difference. 

Q.  Do you have a psychological coach or anything like that? 
STEWART CINK:   Yeah, I work with Bob Rotella and I also work with Preston Waddington, he's a  -- I don't know what he is.  He's a helper.  (Laughter.)
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:   Can we go through your round.  You started on 1. 
STEWART CINK:   My round, we're going to have to spend a lot of time talking about it because I had a lot of happenings. 
I hit it close on 1, about four feet with a wedge. 
Hit an 8-iron on 3 about ten feet.
Missed green on 4.  Chipped it about five feet and missed it.
5, I hit it near the green, just a little pitch up the green about three feet and made that. 
6, I hit the fairway bunker about ten feet and made that.
7, I almost aced it, hit a 6-iron about a foot. 
9, I hit a sand wedge about 15 feet. 
11 was really a key one because I made a great up-and-down for par, from over the right bunker.  I had no green to work with.  I hit it about four feet.  That was good for momentum.
Gave all that back on 14, 3-putting from about 40, 50 feet. 
Made a good save on 15 from short of the green, about a 5-footer for par there.
Another good save on 16 from left of the green which is the place you don't want to be in.
And 17, I hit a 9-iron about six feet.
18, 7-iron about ten feet. 

Q.  I wanted to know, you said the last two or three months you've felt your game starting to improve.  Was there a point in that time where dealing with these issues of fear that you suddenly said, wow, this is  -- that you kind of saw the light and things started to change and you felt like your uphill battle was maybe a little flatter from that point? 
STEWART CINK:   Good question.  And yes, there was definitely a moment. 
In Tucson this year, I was playing pretty well.  I don't know what place, but I was in good shape for a good finish.  I wasn't really in contention to win the tournament, but I came out on Sunday, which is the kind of situation that I would be in last year at this point and really just felt very fragile and vulnerable to make mistakes and really just shaky in general. 
I came out there and I was like 7-under through  -- well, I shot 6-under.  I played a great round.  Never really got nervous.  Put myself in the top 5 or six, I think I finished.  So I got up there for a good finish, which I haven't had very many of that year. 
That was the point where I realized that putting this stuff into play on the golf course in pressure situations is actually something I can do.  And ever since then, whenever I've been in a position for that type of an occurrence, I've really relied on it. 
I'm not saying that I will be perfect, but not hanging on the result of every shot so much, it just makes me so much more comfortable playing.  I realize now that 73 or 47 is not the end of my world.  My wife is not going to lock me out of the house and last year it almost got that bad where I felt like I had to control everything because I just wasn't able to allow myself to shoot over par. 

Q.  Did what happened in the U.S. Open a couple of years back, was that a point when you were in the middle of the fear, did that cause the fear?
STEWART CINK:   Well, that's something that I've talked about a lot.  That actually was more of a result of my feelings, playing well and then kind of screwing up there in the middle of all the limelight, that was more of a result of the fears I was having then, something that caused it.  It came from before that, something that's pretty deeply rooted and, in fact, I have not been able to find out if anything happened on the golf course specifically that might have caused it.  That was more of the result of it.  It didn't help it very much. 

Q.  You mentioned the Ryder Cup.  Did that add to the tension?  That's obviously a different thing, and guys talk about the pressure there; did you see that out there?  Did that sort of feed what you were fighting? 
STEWART CINK:   Yeah, I felt like I was  -- well, I was struggling with being in front of everybody and making mistakes and just feeling like a vulnerable, weak player, basically. 
And so I felt like from the time they postponed the Ryder Cup, that was a year of basically being in the spotlight, which is not what I needed, at all. 
I was just not looking forward to playing in the Ryder Cup at all because I was playing poorly.  That's the ultimate stage in golf.  To be honest, I was kind of scared of playing it. 
When I got over there and actually realized that, hey, there's 12 guys on each team that are going to be going through just as much fear, probably, as I am, and I realized it's just golf.  The feeling leading up to it was actually a lot worse than the nervousness once I teed it up. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:   Thank you, Stewart, for joining us.
