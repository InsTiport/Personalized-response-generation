 Q.  Emmett, how were you hitting them out there today? 
 EMMETT SMITH:  Not bad.  Not bad for my second time playing this year.  It's all good. 

 Q.  Learn anything from Brandt out there? 
 EMMETT SMITH:  I learned he can turn it on when he wants to.  The guy has a great game.  He was Rookie of the Year last year, and obviously he has the tools to make it. 

 Q.  You rolled that 10-, 12-footer in on 14, that was pretty nice. 
 EMMETT SMITH:  Yeah, that was a good one.  I needed that one big-time. 

 Q.  So overall a pretty good day, enjoyed yourself out there? 
 EMMETT SMITH:  Overall had a good day.  Signed a lot of autographs, took a lot of photos, got heckled quite a bit. 

 Q.  So you've got bigger business coming up this weekend.  Looking forward to the Super Bowl this week? 
 EMMETT SMITH:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking forward to watching the game.  I'm really looking forward to having the party around the game, you know what I'm saying?  I'm going to enjoy the game like a fan now for a change, so it's all good.  I'm going to do my little deal with ESPN on Sunday morning, do the Sunday Morning Countdown, and we'll go from there. 

 Q.  Any predictions?  Have you given one out yet? 
 EMMETT SMITH:  You know, I'll save that for on the air because they're going to ask me the same question, so I'll save it for then. 

 Q.  Fair enough.  No prediction, but thoughts on the game? 
 EMMETT SMITH:  I think it should be a good game.  You have the Giants' defense that's pretty solid, and obviously New England is one of the best teams I've ever seen.  Should be a great match-up. 

 Q.  How would your Cowboys' team stack up against those Patriots? 
 EMMETT SMITH:  Obviously not well.  They lost to them earlier in the season. 

 Q.  No, your Cowboys team? 
 EMMETT SMITH:  Come on, please, that's not even a question.
