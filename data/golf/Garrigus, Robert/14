Q.   Seven birdies, an eagle, a few bogeys in there.   How was your day? 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   It was a roller coaster.   I felt like I hit it great all day.   I was struggling with little distances in the morning.   First shot went way over the green, second one was way short, so we were kind of struggling a little bit.   But rolled some putts in.   I've been working with the Stockton boys and my coach Jim Ahern, and kind of picking what I like out of their style and taking mine into effect, too, and starting to roll some in.   It's nice to see, and very pleased with the way things went today.

Q.   With the breeze down, how does this golf course play?   Much easier?
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, it's way easier.   When you're not thinking about hitting it into the rain forest every time you're on the tee box because the wind is blowing 40 miles an hour, it makes it a little easier.   I hit the ball very well today, struck my irons well, and finally got the distances dialed up, and almost won a car on 15.   I don't know how it didn't go in, but we're having fun out there, and it's nice to be in MÃ©xico and playing well, that's for sure.

Q.   What exactly are you working on with the Stocktons?
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   It was everything.   I changed everything.   I changed my short game and I changed my putting stroke completely.   In the first two weeks out here in San Jose, Napa there, and Vegas, I was so confused on what I was doing, and I felt mechanical, and when I get mechanical, I'm MC Hammering for sure because there's no way I'm making putts.   I kind of started getting the feel back into it, not thinking so much, and just everything that I worked on is kind of grinded in now, and the hands being a little higher, a little more loft in the putting, getting a little more forward press, it's working this week.   You just never know when your time is going to come.   You wish you could play well every year at the Masters and win, but it's nice to have a good round come slap me in the face.

Q.   Nice to be at a place that's very relaxed before the break?
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Absolutely.   My whole family is here.   We've pretty much been at the beach every day.   Just the whole atmosphere of this tournament, they treat us so good.   Being on the beach with the boys, kind of putting everything into perspective makes a big difference. 

Q.   After a slow start, Robert Garrigus able to really turn things around.   How did you attack the course and get it to 6‑under? 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   You know, it was putting.   I hit a couple really good shots on the par‑5s.   I think I made an eagle on, I don't know, 11 or 12, whatever the par‑5 is on the back after missing a one‑footer, went through my routine and hit a spike mark and bounced off line.   I kind of dealt with that and went eagle‑birdie‑birdie after that.   Almost made a hole‑in‑one on 15.   Almost got that car.   It was kind of fun.   The crowd actually gave it a little ooh and ahh which was nice, I hadn't heard that all day.   It was fun to get off to a good start.   I rolled it well today and hit it well, so it was nice.

Q.   John Huh actually knocked it in and won a car today. 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Oh, nice.

Q.   How different a feel does it have this week?   I know it's the final event of 2014, a little different for guys as they get ready to unwind with the break. 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, I spent two weeks in the mountains hunting for elk and deer, I think it was about 15 days ago or so, and kind of put a lot of things in perspective for this tournament.   It's not the end of the world.   It is a game, and we go out and play it and hopefully have fun, and that's what I'm doing this week, and that's going to be my perspective for the rest of the week.
