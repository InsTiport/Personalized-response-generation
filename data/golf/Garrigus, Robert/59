  Q. Talk about your round today.   
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah, it was a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun with Sergio today. We kind of got off to a little bit of a slow start there. Even though I birdied the first hole, I felt like I needed to get something going. I hit a good 6-iron on the par-5 and made some great up-and-downs on 7, 8 and 9. Those kept the round going and then I made a lot of good swings on the backside. I just didn't capitalize on a lot of the putts.   
 But all in all it was a good day. I shot 3-under on Saturday in the U.S. Open and didn't pick up any ground. It was kind of fun.  
  
  Q. Would you be surprised to hear this is the lowest scoring round in the U.S. Open in 20 years or more?  
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: No, I wouldn't be surprised at all. The golf course was gettable. The rough is thick enough if you hit a bad shot, you're going to pay the price. I'll tell you what, everything was receptive, the greens were perfect. My balls were rolling perfect all day. I was really impressed how the USGA held it together. It was great. But, yeah, there were some low scores shot today. And I saw why out there. Everything was soft and the greens were perfect.
