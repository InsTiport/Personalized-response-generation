LAURY LIVSEY:  We'd like to welcome Robert Garrigus into the interview room.  You shot a 4 under 68, and you're right there.
ROBERT GARRIGUS:  Yeah.  It's going to be fun tomorrow.  I've never been in this position out here.  I did it a couple times on the Nationwide Tour.  This is a different stage, but you've just got to go out and do the same things.
Q.  Do you just really go out and play the same round, whether it's Thursday, whether it's tomorrow, whether it's at a Nationwide Tour or a Masters?
ROBERT GARRIGUS:  I've played in a major; I played in the U.S. Open in 2004 at Shinnecock.  You go out and you play golf.  That's what we do.  This is our job, and you kind of    a couple times today I was kind of looking at the board, and I got kind of pumped up on a couple holes, and I knew I was going to if I got in that position.

But that's what I live for.  That's what we're out here for is to get in position to win.  You know, whether you do good or you do bad, you're there, and it's a great experience.
Q.  With as many guys on the board having not won, what do you think that will be like tomorrow?  Will that have any effect on what goes on?
ROBERT GARRIGUS:  Not really.  I think everybody is playing well at the top of the board.  I mean, we're making putts, we're hitting good shots, and that's what everybody wants to see and that's hopefully what we can do tomorrow.  I don't think it's going to have a whole    a ton of effect on tomorrow just because it's a good golf course, the greens are soft, you can throw it at the flag, and whoever can hold    just keep their nerves together.  Like Greg said earlier, he said whoever is going to make the putts.  Whoever can make the putt at the right time usually gets the job done.  Hopefully that's me tomorrow.
LAURY LIVSEY:  Robert, thanks.  Appreciate you coming in.
