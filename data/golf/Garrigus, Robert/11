 Q. I know you're disappointed with the bogey on the last, but still a good start to the tournament. Get some comments?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah, it was a good start to the tournament, like you said. I just got fooled with the wind there and the chip was fast or whatever. 18 was a little frustrating, number nine. Had a good day, hit it well. Hit a lot of fairways, hit a bunch of greens, got a couple good breaks and some bad ones. But all in all, 12 points, pretty good.   
It's been a tough year, and I need to keep going. So hopefully 12 points on the way to 50 points. That's my goal this week.  
   
 Q. Bogeys, where, and did you just mis‑hit balls?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS: No, both my bogeys were on good shots, I thought. One was a 9 iron from 178 yards, I flew it 190, which is going to happen out here. It's Reno. I kind of joked that it's like playing on the moon‑‑ the ball never comes down and you can't breathe. So it happened to me on the one long and I thought the shot on 18 or No. 9, my 18th hole was playing like 115. It was more like 120. Just got fooled a little bit. It was a good day just to‑‑ I didn't really make many bad swings. That was good. Just need to keep putting well.  
   
 Q. Did you like the format, being able to be aggressive out there?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS: Absolutely. I was telling my caddie, Brent, we had four looks at eagle today and all of them went six, seven feet past. I'm like I'm not leaving one of these short this week; it's too important.   
I had to hit it really well, hit the par 5s in two. But ran it by them. It was a fun day and hopefully it continues tomorrow.
