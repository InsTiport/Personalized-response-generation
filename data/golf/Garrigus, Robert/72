 Q. Battle all day. Kind of an up-and-down round. 
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah.

 Q. I know it's not the way you want to finish, but you're going to be right there going into tomorrow. 
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah. It was fun today. I like being in contention, and I like feeling the nerves, and getting out there trying to do it. 
 18 I should have backed off. I heard something right in the middle of my back swing and just jerked it off the tee. And actually I hit a great shot onto the green, and then the putt, I don't know, it was bouncy down there. Whatever. Like you said, I'm right there, one shot back. Good round tomorrow will get it done and I'm looking forward to it.

 Q. Any difference in the golf course? A couple guys said the wind was a little tricky today. Anything different from the first two days?
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: The wind was tricky today. It was gusting, like on 17, it switched right in my face right as soon as I hit, and I would have been 10 feet for eagle and instead I had a 25-footer for birdie. 
 Made it a few strokes hard today. It was nice to see Graham get out there and shoot 62. It was out there. I went out there, I really didn't feel great today. Like you said, I was just kind of battling, but you know, it was tricky today and hopefully tomorrow it'll be the same. It'll be fun. 

 Q. Any thoughts going into tomorrow? Anything, can you draw from earlier in the year in Memphis or anything or are you just going to go out and play golf?
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: Well, you just gotta go play golf. I can draw from Memphis. I can say I've been there. I've had the lead going into the last 18 holes, so I know what that's going to feel like. Some guys that are out there don't. So I'm looking forward to that, and it should be fun.
