 Q.   You played great all week, obviously didn't come out on the best end in the afternoon today, but just some comments overall.   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, it was a great week.   I didn't make many good golf swings this afternoon.   I think I put so much energy into that first match mentally, I kind of lost focus this afternoon, which I can learn from, and that's a good thing.   And I still had a chance with making all those bad swings and hitting it in the bushes three or four times.   If I kept it in the fairway in the afternoon, I would have been fine, but I kept hitting it in the darned desert.   
It was disappointing to lose the match, but all in all, it was a great week.   Another top 5 in front of the stage that I wanted it in front of.   It's not in Puerto Rico or MÃ©xico, this is a World Golf Championships, and it's all good things.   I played well, Matt played well, we had a good time today, and that's about it.   
   
 Q.   All week you've commented on your confidence level, how it's really right where you want it to be, and you still sound as if it's right there.   Do you take that confidence level moving forward?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Absolutely.   There's nothing to be upset or worried about with the afternoon match where I had 20 minutes to turn around and barely get something to eat and come out and‑‑ I had a little thing happen with my wrist on No.1, and it was bothering me the rest of the day, but that's no excuse.  
   
 Q.   Which wrist?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   My left wrist.   It locked up on me on the first hole and I hit it way right.   Still had a chance, but it was just unfortunate that I didn't swing it well in the afternoon.   I wish I would have, but I felt like I hung in there, hit a phenomenal bunker shot on 11, and then bought a couple holes there.   But confidence is sky high, it's through the roof, so looking forward to the next few weeks.
