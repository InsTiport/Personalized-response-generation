 Q. Got things going on early on your back nine. Couple bogeys coming in, but still in the middle of it going into tomorrow. 
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah, you know, I love this golf course. I've always played well here. I was in the lead Saturday and Sunday last year, so I'm comfortable at this place. 
 Again I did have a short eagle putt to get to 9-under and just missed it. It's a fun course; ball goes forever and you can't breathe. It's a lot of fun walking up and down these hills. 

 Q. Just saw your scorecard. Three birdies on the par-5s I know that's kind of your M.O. Does that play into your wheelhouse, especially with the thin air?
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: Absolutely. I can hit 3-wood off the tees on the par-5s and still get to them in two - and some of 'em are 600 yards. 
 It's a lot fun being able to hit it this far. I know I hit it far already, but it's extra special when you can hit a tee shot 400 yards and you don't really have to do much.
 So it's a lot of fun out here and the greens are fairly good, so I'm looking forward to the weekend. 

 Q. You able to draw on last year's experience at all going into the weekend, especially now having gotten that win at Disney?
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: Absolutely. I don't think I'm going to be as jittery as I was last year. I think I wasn't as confident on the weekend last year as I should've been, especially with my putting. 
 I'm not going to worry about hitting it three, four feet by the hole, because I'm going to be trying to make everything in, and hopefully going and getting 'em.
