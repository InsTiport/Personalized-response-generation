 Q.   Good way to end the round.   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, two birdies, just lost by a shot and missed a bunch of putts on the front, and that was the difference.   It's another runner‑up finish this year.   I think that's number four.   Piling up the cash.   Just need to get a win.   Hopefully the next two weeks will pan out for me.  
   
 Q.   Can you reflect on your week so far and what you think of this tournament?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   It's a phenomenal tournament.   We've had a lot of fun, I shot 21‑under par and didn't win the golf tournament.   That's unfortunate.   But the people are great, the town was great.   It was a little warm, but it was nice today.   It was a definite treat.  
   
 Q.   Were you watching the leaderboard today?   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   I looked on 13 and 14 to see what Nick was doing.   He was running away from us, so I kind of turned up the jets a little bit and didn't get as many as I needed to, but I birdied the last two holes, birdied three of the last four, five of the last seven.   It's disappointing, but whatever.  
   
 Q.   This event is official PGA TOUR money next year.   Do you think that will attract more players to come here?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   I believe so.   This is a great tournament, a great opportunity for people to get World Ranking points and come over here and play some golf.   It's beautiful.  
   
 Q.   What will you take away from this week?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   I shot 21‑under par, shot 5‑under with the lead on Sunday and did not win, and we got clipped by a buzz saw today.   Nick Watney tore it up, and that's the way it goes.
