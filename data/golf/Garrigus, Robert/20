Q.   How did the course play? 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   It was tough, especially towards the end there.   The greens got really bumpy, really bumpy.   I missed a couple putts, short ones, and I hit them right where I wanted to at the right speed.   Very pleased with the round and the golf course is going to be good for them tomorrow morning when they come back out after the restart, so I think might have got a little break there.   I was hitting the golf ball well and the golf course is firm and fast and that's what we love.

Q.   Kind of a rough way to end the round.   How do you feel about going into the weekend? 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Not really.   I birdied the last hole.   That's the only one I care about.   The other two I hit good tee shots, except the one on 8, got a little squirrely.   That's the way golf is, I hit it crooked sometimes and have to deal with it.   Not a big deal.   Got a good birdie on 9 there.   Had a perfect number with a sand wedge in my hand and stuffed it in there and made birdie, so I'm looking forward to the weekend.
