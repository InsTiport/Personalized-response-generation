Q.   What was the key for you today?
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   You know, for some reason I felt very refreshed.   I played in Malaysia and China.   Got a lot of rest the last couple days.   It's been sleeping and hanging out with the family. 
So I don't know.   I didn't hit many balls this week.   I just kind of showed up this morning and I started striking it.   So it was a lot of fun today.

Q.   Did you have some doubts coming back from Malaysia to turn it around this quickly?
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah.   I didn't think I'd have a lot of energy, but I got a lot of good rest.   I did some fishing and relaxed and kept my mind off of golf.   It really helped. 
I really maybe hit one bad shot today, and I had to strike it well because the wind was blowing pretty good there the past probably 12 holes or so.   And it was cold, very cold.   But I birdied the first two holes out of the gate, and I didn't expect that at all.
But you know, the course played tough today.

Q.   You always play well here.   I mean this is a place you love to play. 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah.   I think it's the fishing.   It really just relaxes me.   I don't think about golf until I tee it up on Thursday, and I tell you what, I wish more places were like this, for sure.

Q.   Are you going fishing today?
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   I might.   I don't know.   I might go back and rest.   I woke up at 4:00 this morning.   I'm still over in Asia apparently.   Didn't need a wakeâ€‘up call.   I usually do when it's 5:00.   I'd like to go fishing.   I might do it somewhere else than the golf course, though.

Q.   Robert, thanks.   Keep it going. 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Thanks.   Appreciate it.
