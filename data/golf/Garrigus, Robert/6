Q. Strong finish for you.
ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah, it was a bit dicey last night.  I don't know if it was playable.  Coming out this morning there was no wind and it was, it is wet, it's going to be wet all week.
But made a good birdie on 7 and 8 there was a really good birdie.
So I hit a 4-iron out of the rough from 180 yards on 9 and just laced it at the flag and made a good par there.  So it was a good finish to the day.
Q. Was fog a problem?  We had some groups held in place out here.  Was fog a problem for you?
ROBERT GARRIGUS: Not really.  I'm a feel guy and if I kind of know where I'm hitting it anyways, I could feel it off the face.  We really couldn't see much on the 9th there.
8 was okay.  I could still see the flag.
But it was coming in waves.  It was all right, just wait a couple minutes and you could see the flag and just hit it.
Q. Headed over to Pebble Beach now, maybe a calm day, ball in hand, I would suspect that with receptive greens, that you're anxious to get over there.
ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah.  I'm not so anxious to putt on those receptive greens because of the spike marks and the footprints, but -- and I'm accepting that.  So it's going to be a good day regardless, get to play Pebble Beach, get to play golf for a living, it's a good deal, so I'm looking forward to it.
