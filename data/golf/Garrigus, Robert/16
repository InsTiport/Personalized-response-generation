 Q.     Robert, we said at the beginning of the day a quick start would be great, it wasn't imperative.   How much behind the 8-ball did you get in out of the gate?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, it was.   I know what I'm not going to be doing next year is fishing.   I'm going to bring a damn chain saw out to the place and cut a few trees down.   I kept hitting it behind them all day.   
You know, just didn't -- I just didn't get any breaks.   That bad break on 3 and ended up making double.   
I was missing some putts, wasn't starting it on line.   The wind was kind of affecting me a little bit.   
You know, I stopped doing all that and then kind of got back into the tournament there and then started rolling them in.   So, that gives me a lot of confidence.   It's my first Top-5 since, you know, last year at the Match Play.   So, all good things going out of this.   Got some bad breaks today and it was unfortunate but I'm playing well.   I'm doing the right things and, you know, I'm looking forward to next week.
