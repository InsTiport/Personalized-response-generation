  ROBERT GARRIGUS:   It was really difficult, especially starting out.   I got the round started off, hit it in the rough with a mud ball and kind of made about a 20-footer for par and I was like all right, usually some of the good days start with a long par putt and ended up birdieing every par 5 out there today.   
Hit two massive shots on No. 5.   I hit the driver and 7 wood over the green there and the wind was swirling.   It was tough out there.   I'm glad I got it in 2-under.  
   
 Q.   You've had some success on this golf course.   
How much does that knowledge help you in conditions like this?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   You know, it's huge because I know where to miss it.   I'm aware, you know, where not to hit it and I feel like on this golf course all the tee shots set-up, shape well for my golf swing and the ball I'm hitting right now so I'm very confident going into the next few days and hopefully keeps blowing.   It was a lot of fun today.
