Q.   What a great way to start this tournament.   Back nine there you make the birdie on the last hole, the 9th, the last hole of your day, and the eagle on 7, that's a great way to play. 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, I absolutely striped it all day.   I could have shot 10‑ or 11‑under today if I had made some putts.   I was hitting it really close all day. 
I didn't get frustrated; I just kept hitting it.   The greens got a little bumpy because they were soft.   I don't think that the rain helped at all last night.   But, overall, I think the course conditions are pretty good.   I'm very confident right now and hitting it really well, so it was a lot of fun today.

Q.   Describe the eagle at 7.   That had to be a thrill here in the first round. 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, I hit it in the fairway bunker, and I had 212 hole, and it was a perfect cut 5‑iron.   I had a perfect lie in there.   I could have hit driver out of there.   I hit a perfect high draw, held the wind, landed ten feet short, rolled it two feet past, made the two‑footer and got the heck out of there.

Q.   When you play so well in the first round like this, how excited are you to get right back out there and get back out and attack the course again tomorrow? 
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   It would be nice if I was teeing off in the morning, but I'm going to have to wait until tomorrow afternoon.   I'll probably be in 10th place by the time I tee off.   So it's nice to get a good start and feel the vibe and put some heat on myself the next few days.   That's when I play my best.   I'm looking forward to it.
