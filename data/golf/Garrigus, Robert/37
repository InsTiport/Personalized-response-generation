 Q.   You must be happy that you're leading the tournament?   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, I don't know.   I must have been tired or something from the past couple days.   Didn't really have my golf swing that much today.   I hit some bad shots, hit some bad putts, but sucked it up coming down there in the last.   
Birdied the last three holes getting into the last group.   Now I can see what's going to happen tomorrow.   It's going to be a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   After the opening start, what would you tell yourself today?   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   I always remain patient.   I never get panicked.   I never get too upset or too overjoyed.   I just told myself there are so many birdie holes on this golf course.   Even coming down the stretch I made some really good golf swings.   I made a good golf swing on 16, 17, 18, and made some great shots in there.   It was nice to end the day that way.  
   
 Q.   Was there one turning point for you?   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   The putt on 16 was pretty big.   I hadn't really made much.   I kind of three‑putted the other par‑3, and I needed to get one to go in to get some momentum.   Once that happens for me, I usually start making putts, and that was a big putt.  
   
 Q.   The way you came back today, are you feeling confident for the last day?   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Absolutely.   Just a few bad swings and a few bad putts.   Other than that, I'm confident for tomorrow and ready to go.  
   
 Q.   What would you do differently for tomorrow?   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Nothing.   Just go out and fire at flags and see what happens.
