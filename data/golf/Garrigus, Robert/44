 Q.   Robert, another good solid round where you gave yourself a million chances.   Is it 11‑under with a smile on your face, or are you thinking, I could be 16?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, it's definitely 11‑under and I can be at 16.   But it's just two days.   The greens got a little bit bumpy.   Made a bad stroke on 8, and 6 there I stuck it in there‑‑ or 5, rather.  
Gosh, I'm striping it.   Just I don't know.   I hit that putt on 9 there kind of right center.   It broke right, so don't know if it hit a footprint or whatever.   I'm hitting it so good.   
I'm looking forward to this weekend.   If I keep hitting it like this up and get a couple putts to go in, it's going to be a lot fun.  
   
 Q.   You're hitting it really well.   It's set up right now for a guy like you.   Pretty soft, isn't it?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, it is soft.   Fairways are a little firm and kind of a little inconsistent with the bounces.   The one I planned to get back there spin, and the one that I plan to fly and spin back, they don't.   I got to get it figured out and it'll be a lot of fun this weekend.   
   
 Q.   You got good as good a feeling about your game as you have in a while?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, absolutely.   I finished fourth at congressional and didn't make any putts there.   Just striped it around there and finished in the top 5.   
And today, gosh, I could have shot 10 yesterday; I could have shot 10 today, too.   It's just stupid how close I'm hitting it with all my clubs.   5‑irons, 4 irons, doesn't matter what I was hitting, it was close.  
Keep doing that and make a couple putts on the weekend and it could get scary.   
   
 Q.   Scary fun.   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Absolutely.   
   
 Q.   Good luck to you.   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Thank you.
