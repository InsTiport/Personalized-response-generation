 Q. If you could, just tell me about your round today, obviously different conditions, a little tougher, how did it go out there for you?
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: It was great. I started off -- actually, the first five holes, I had a par putt outside of four feet on every hole and I made like a 25-footer for par on 3. And I'm like, man, if I could just make one birdie, I could get the day going. 
 And I made a nice birdie on 7 and then made one on 8, and then made a nice -- a very nice birdie on 9. I hit it like 390 on 9 and hit a wedge -- I've never hit lob-wedge in there before. I hit lob-wedge in there to like 15 feet and made birdie.
 Then turned around into the wind, and on 11, made a bad swing, made a bad decision with the club and made bogey, a 25-footer for bogey there, too. So I hit a perfect drive on 12 and hit it in the water and made par and then 3-putted 14, kind of lost my concentration. But you know, it was a great day. Birdied 17 and 18. 
 I love this golf course. I can hit it anywhere, really, if I just keep it out of the sauce, it ends up really good for me because I can have short clubs in.

 Q. Do you think with the conditions toughening up a little bit today, do you think scores are going to come back a little bit? 
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: They should. And it looks like in the bottom part of the field they are going to come back. But I see somebody is 10-under. The greens are so perfect this morning, if you hit a putt where you're supposed to, it was going in. I think 10 or 12 is probably going to be leading by the end of the day and if the wind picks up, I think it will probably stay at 10.
