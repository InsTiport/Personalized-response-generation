 Q.   What a nice round of golf and what a nice way to finish off, you had a great look at eagle on the last hole?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, we read it to flatten out a little bit and just kept breaking.   Was perfect speed, it would have dived right in if I hit it a little higher.   It was a good day.   A little mud ball on 16, kind of hit a little too far right and didn't get it up‑and‑down, but all in all it was a great day and good last two days.  
   
 Q.   A good ball‑striking round for you, 15 greens out there with 29 putts.   
ROBERT GARRIGUS:   Yeah, and that adds up nicely when you can get in the 20 tees and hit that many greens.   I was striking it well.   I probably had the worst range session of my life this morning, so I figured you know, what the heck I'll probably go out and stripe it and I did.   Just works out sometimes that way and I'm glad it did.  
I was here a couple years ago and had a scare with dehydration, had to go to the hospital and I made sure I stayed hydrated today, kind of waiting for the drug testers to come get me because I know they are here this week.   You know, they didn't come get me, so that was nice, and ready to play tomorrow.
