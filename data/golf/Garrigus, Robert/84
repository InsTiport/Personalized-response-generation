 Q. Tough couple of days for you, but hole-in-one, can you talk about that on No. 13?
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah, that was one of the only highlights of the week for me. We're standing on the tee box waiting for the group in front of us, I was joking around trying to Chuck stuff in the garbage I'm not really paying attention, get up, slapped an 8-iron right at it and ended up going in; it was kind of a shock, didn't expect it to go in. It was the first one on the PGA TOUR can couldn't have happened at a better place. 
 It was No. 9 for me. I've had a bunch go in in my life, but none cooler than that.

 Q. Talk about the hole location today. 
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: That was I pretty nasty hole location on the front right real estate with the wind coming in, the wind seemed to die when I hit the shot and it was going right at it, tracked the whole way, lined it three or four feet short and popped in the hole.

 Q. As far as obviously not the two days you expected but maybe talk about the conditions and your week. 
 ROBERT GARRIGUS: The conditions are extremely tough, and I have a very hard time reading these greens. And you know, I'm not a big bermudagrass guy. I like poa annua and bent, so I knew it was going to be a tough week for me. 
 The conditions are extremely difficult, and you miss the green on the wrong side, you're making five regardless, if you hit a good chip or not, because they are rolling off the other sides. The greens are small and fast and tough and it's a good test. I just didn't play well.
