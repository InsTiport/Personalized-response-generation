 Q.  Robert, nice finish to the tournament.  Just get some thoughts on your final round.  
ROBERT GARRIGUS: Yeah, final round was great.  I was hitting it great.  Didn't miss any of my spots really all day, maybe one on the par-3 on 5 there.   
Struck the ball really well.  Hit some good putts.  Wish I could have gotten a couple more there coming in to make them nervous but I really can't say enough about how well I hit it and my caddy kept me in there all day.  I was sick all week, had a huge fever on Saturday, almost withdrew from the tournament.   
I almost didn't play on Saturday morning and shoot 9-under on the week out here was a blessing.   
 Q.  What is it about that sometimes when a golfer is sick seems to bring out even better play?  
ROBERT GARRIGUS: I never played well when I was sick.  For whatever reason this week I was so sick that I could have cared less about my golf and I think that's what held me up.  It's kind of funny how it works but, you know, I'm glad my head is clear now.  Finally I can get on an airplane and not have a sinus headache.   
 Q.  You missed a couple cuts in a row.  You're really starting to build some momentum the last three tournaments.  
ROBERT GARRIGUS: Hundred percent.  I switched to a new Cure putter in New Orleans and really started seeing the fruits of that in Charlotte.  I finished -- first time I finished in the Top 30 in a couple years seemed like last week which really gave me some confidence and this week I don't know what I'm going to finish but whatever it is, it was a great week and had so much fun, you know, just playing well finally.
