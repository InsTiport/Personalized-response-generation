Q. A little bit of a rough finish but you still accomplished your goal for the week getting to BMW.  Your thoughts on advancing?
HARRY HIGGS:   Sure, yeah.  I played darn near 71 really good holes.  That wedge shot was made infinitely harder with all the rain.  But yeah, happy to move on and try to get in a position again to finish better next time for sure.
Q. As you move on to Chicago, just your thoughts on where your game is at right now?
HARRY HIGGS:   It's good, yeah.  I mean, I finished darned near probably close to the Top-10 this week.  When you do that, things are good.  Just keep holing a few more putts.  I hit a lot of good putts on the back nine, and maybe was just off on reads and they didn't fall and that's the way it is, but I gave myself plenty of chances throughout the week.
Q. What do you think about, you have a really low score for the week, but yet, the leader doubles what your number is.
HARRY HIGGS:   Sure.  I don't have a whole lot of thoughts on it.  He's doubled my score.  You know, it's unbelievable golf.  Friday, Saturday and Sunday, basically the leaderboard, you just check and look how much more under par he is and you just laugh.
My goal today was to go out and try to win the B Flight because the A Flight was taken care of.  It's unbelievable.  I didn't see, 28-, 29-, 30-under, whatever he gets to.  I didn't see that.  More power to him.  That's pretty amazing.
