Q. Course is playing tough out there today.  How would you assess your round?
PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   To be honest with you, it was a similar game than the last two rounds, just I had fewer putts in.  I took like so many lip out and all that, so obviously no birdies.
And then it's longer because the ball doesn't roll and then pin positions were tough, tricky sometimes, and it was kind of a different course with the different wind direction and a bit wet.
Q. Playing in your first U.S. Women's Open.  How has it been just the entire week and your experience so far?
PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   It's been a great experience.  Yeah, I'm really frustrated of today's round because I wanted to do like something better, I guess, but I've been enjoying it lot so far.
Q. What's it going to take tomorrow to maybe get up there near the top of the leaderboard and have a strong finish?
PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   I would say putting.  Putting is key.  I had two many three-putts and I missed the momentum.  So it's be there when there are momentums and get birdies when you get the chance, when you're close to the pin, and then just like have -- like two-putts very far from the hole are like a good advantage.
