Q. (No Microphone.)
PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   It was super wet and the course was longer and pin positions were really, really tough.  I really struggled getting the speed of the greens and reading the greens.  I made my day on two holes.  So it's kind of very, very frustrating, but it's golf.
Q. How would you rate your week overall and just your experience this week?
PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   It's very tough to talk about it, because like it was a very frustrating day.  But like with some, like with a step back, I would say that it's a great week.  I made my first cut in a major, so it's really positive and there are so many positive things on my game, behavior and all that.  But for now like I'm kind of stuck on those three holes.
Q. What's next for you?  Do you have any tournaments until the spring season?
PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   I'm leaving on Friday for the Palmer Cup.  So that's the last one this year.
