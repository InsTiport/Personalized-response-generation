  Q. How were the greens today compared to yesterday?
 PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   They were definitely tougher. The wind was blowing a little bit more, and especially with the cold, the cold made it way more difficult. The wind allowed us to have like, some shorter holes, but at the same time, when the wind was in the back, it was kind of hard to stop the ball on the green. So it's definitely a tougher round than yesterday.
 Q. How do you feel after your round today?
 PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   It was a very good round, very bad finish. So a little bit frustrated about that because it's always about the finish, so I kind of messed up on that. But a very, very good round in these conditions. Managed to stay very patient and had a couple birdie occasions that I did not make, but I holed some.
 So on 16 holes, it was pretty good, then started being a little bit worse, I would say.
 Q. Are you going to go to the range?  Anything right now you're going to work on?
 PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   I'm definitely going to practice for sure.  I'd say the biggest work is my putting because my putting is right now very irregular, I would say. Like I don't really know what I'm doing, how the ball is rolling, how I'm striking it, and because the greens are so perfect, it's hard to see where the ball is actually going out of the putter because I often have like a little mark in front of my ball where I have to roll on. On these greens, since it's like perfect, it's hard to have something and figure out if it was a good or a bad putt.
 So the only feedback I have is the roll, and the ball is not rolling really good. So I definitely have to work on my putting.
 Q. Talk about your excitement to play at Augusta National.
 PAULINE ROUSSIN-BOUCHARD:   I'm very excited. It's going to be an amazing day, an amazing two days. Yes, I'm super excited.
