 Q.   Good playing this week.   
JASON DAY:   Yeah, it was nice.   I hit a lot of greens out there.   I think I hit 17 greens.   I was trying to hit 18 greens, give myself opportunities for birdie out there.   I had a lot of fun playing with Jim this week and I'm looking forward to playing again in a couple weeks at the Match Play but very happy with how the week went.   
   
 Q.   A little bit of a down year by Jason Day standards last year, looking to turn it around this year and have a good year?  
JASON DAY:   Yeah, definitely.   I feel like the prior ties are kind of straighter onto golf.   Last year was a little tough for me obviously with things going on off the course but really focused on what I need to do this year and hopefully a good year this year.
