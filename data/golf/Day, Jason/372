 Q.   Extremely difficult conditions to play in.   You told us yesterday when you came off the course how emotionally draining it was.   Was that a factor today?  
JASON DAY:   Definitely.   Just wasn't quite sharp, not as sharp as yesterday.   I played great golf yesterday and just came out this morning a little flat and made a lot of mental errors out there and just pretty much gave the game to Kuch.   
Yeah, a little disappointed.   We've had a long week, and it's been, like I said, mentally and physically grinding.   But I've got one more match to go, and I'm just going to try to get some sleep in and see if I can come out firing in the next round.  
   
 Q.   Looks like Ian Poulter will be the opponent.   How do you lift yourself to play him?  
JASON DAY:   Well, it's just good experience regardless of how the match goes.   It's going to be good to see what he does in match play, and maybe I can take this experience and put it further to maybe the Presidents Cup and see how it goes.   
   
 Q.   Three major champions you've beaten this week already and a chance to beat Ian this afternoon, as well.   That will give you a lot of confidence going forward?  
JASON DAY:   Yeah, I think the whole week in itself is a positive week for myself.   I played good golf against great golfers, and I've got one more match to go against probably one of the most feared match play players.
