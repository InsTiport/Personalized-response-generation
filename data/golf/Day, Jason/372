Q.   Took a little bit of extra time, but nonetheless, here you are.   Just a few comments about the match today. 
JASON DAY:   I think Russell only missed one green today, which was very, very frustrating on my side, because he hit it great, so that means you have to make birdie.   I just did enough today to win.   He was very clutch on 18 to actually hole the putt and get it back to all square.   And fortunately I hit a nice tight one into the 19th hole, and he missed his birdie putt and I holed one, which was nice.

Q.   You said you did just enough to get the match won, but how is your confidence?
JASON DAY:   You know, I'm driving the ball really, really nicely.   I could tighten up the irons just a little bit, but I feel like overall my game is pretty solid right now.   I've just got to try and get some rest tonight and get into tomorrow's round.   I know we're going to play 36, so it's going to be mentally grinding and physically grinding tomorrow, so just got to make sure that I rest up as much as I can.
