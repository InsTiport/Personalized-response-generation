 Q.  What experiences do you draw in your golfing career to prepare you for what's on tap?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Not really sure to be honest.  We grow up playing junior golf, a lot of junior teams, so it's nice to be in a team atmosphere.  It's nice to have guys that are behind you picking you up, and you don't get that in golf very often.  Excited to get out there and hit the first tee shot and let's go.   
 Q.  Alongside Jason Day who has been here before, has had a remarkable 2015.  What do you learn from him in terms of preparation that you can hopefully apply here?  
JASON DAY: I think today I've just got to slip in his jet-stream a little bit, just hang on a little bit.  He's playing great.  I've just got to keep my end of the bargain up, and keep playing well also, and hopefully we get off to a good start and see what happens.
