Q.   Tell us about today and how it went. 
JASON DAY:   I had a bug in my eye on 15, it actually flew into my eye, and I was struggling with that, and I saw the medic and they got me some saline, and I had it looked at on the 17th, in between the 16th green and the 17th tee.   It was bugging me quite a bit, really red, but made a soft bogey on 15. 
Obviously I hit it in the water on 14, made a putt there for bogey and soft on 15, but other than that the game was solid all day, which was nice.   I'm happy with how everything went. 

Q.   You're still in great position going into the weekend. 
JASON DAY:   Yeah.   It's tough conditions for the guys this afternoon.   We obviously got lucky with the draw, and I think it's going to be tough over the next few days as well.   I think it's going to blow as well. 
Obviously you have to stay patient, especially around here, because it is a tough golf course to play on.   Just really looking forward to playing and competing in the next two rounds. 

Q.   Patience is your strong suit, isn't it? 
JASON DAY:   I hope so.   I hope so!   I was trying to stay as patient as I can over the last two days, and it worked out great, so hopefully I can take that into the next two days. 

Q.   Having had success here before, does that give you confidence going into the mix? 
JASON DAY:   Yeah, I feel comfortable on the course here and I just‑‑ I just want to obviously stay as patient as I can, give every shot 100% and we'll see how it goes at the end of the week. 

Q. Thank you so much.
