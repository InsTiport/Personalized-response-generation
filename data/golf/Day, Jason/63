 Q. 75, 71, 69, so you get a 66 tomorrow and ‑‑  
JASON DAY: Well a little bit less than that. It would be nice. That's the goal to go out and shoot as well as I can. Obviously these guys are going to probably most likely tear up the back side, just hoping for a little bit more weather conditions to make it a little bit tougher, but, yeah, I played some good golf today, I left a few, I actually left five in the jaw today, I was saying earlier, so it could have been at least five better if I got those to the hole. But to be able to shoot in the 60s on a Saturday you're moving in the right direction, which is nice.  
   
 Q. If you did post a number, the pressure on Sunday at Augusta that can do anything to the leaders as well.   
JASON DAY: Yeah, you obviously over the last three to five years, you've seen some pretty crazy things happen, so if you can get in there and shoot like a 7‑ or 8‑under tomorrow and post something and as long as the lead doesn't get too far away today, you never know how that goes, especially on the back side with 11, 12 and coming home with 15 and 17 and 18. So I mean it can be definitely a good thing if you go out and post early. But right now looking at the week I'm a little disappointed with how I started. Obviously I didn't start too well, so that kind of got me on the back foot quick. So I just have to kind of focus on just doing the same things as I have done the last two days and hopefully give myself the opportunities and take them.  
   
 Q. What's it going to take to channel your best golf at Augusta in your best round tomorrow?  
JASON DAY: I think it's going to be a lot more attitude tomorrow than anything. The first two days, well actually the first day was just kind of struggling with the attitude, like I was really frustrated out there, just because things weren't happening. Then today was a lot better. I was a lot more calm out there and I drove it well and hit a lot of quality iron shots and I think if I can just come in and enjoy the day I think that will help a lot.   
   
 Q. What's helped change that attitude? I remember last year Ellie gave you a talking to.   
JASON DAY: Yeah, she gave me a talking to at the streetlight. She was about to beat me up there. Yeah, but it was, I don't know, I just, I know that, if I look at it, anger is not going to help, to a certain degree‑‑ sometimes it does help, but most of the time it doesn't help. So I just got to go and try and focus and pull or do the best job I can and get myself in position. It's all about position at this golf course. I got off to a great start today and just unfortunately couldn't get things going on the back side, so hopefully get some stuff going on the back side tomorrow, on the front side tomorrow and get stuff going on the back side. That would be a good job.  
   
 Q. Can I ask you, was it Tuesday when you played with Leishman, did you see anything in him that gave you sort of a feeling that he was going to go pretty well this week?  
JASON DAY: No, not really, he's played well here beforehand, but Leish is quietly confident in himself, which is good to see. He's a typical Aussie where he's just like kind of quiet and humble, and ‑‑ well yeah, but, no, it‑‑ yeah, he's got a game that, I mean he's got kind of a cut throat game. I played amateur golf with him and for him to post a scores that he did with Tiger around, with a lot of people around, I mean that just goes to show how mentally tough he is. And I, I didn't see, I mean he acts the same way every other week if you play a practice round with him, so I didn't see anything stand out. It's just obviously he got off to a cracking start and he kept rolling with it.  
   
 Q. He's had some great results in Majors, obviously the 2015 British Open and here five years ago. Does he sort of look ready to break that barrier, the Major barrier to you?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I think he's definitely starting to win a lot more, get himself into contention. That's the biggest thing is if you get your self in contention a lot, even if you don't finish it off, sooner or later you're going to do it. So he's starting to win a lot more tournaments on the PGA TOUR, starting to win a lot more around the world, and then also starting to get himself into contention. So once that, once all those things start to happen, then it's only a matter it of time before it actually ends up falling your way and you end up winning.   
   
 Q. Rickie was speculating on Twitter yesterday what a regular hacker, like a 15 handicapper would shoot.   
JASON DAY: Out here?   
   
 Q. Under tournament conditions, on a tough day like yesterday.  
JASON DAY: What he did say they would shoot?  
   
 Q. 88.   
JASON DAY: Yeah, that's about right. I mean, what do you play off?   
   
 Q. 16.   
JASON DAY: Yeah, that's about right.   
   
 Q. From the tips? Tournament conditions.   
JASON DAY: For a 15? Like you're playing well if you‑‑ well, if you're playing well and everything's going your way, you would probably be in the 90s. Mid to high 90s. But I think most of the time ‑‑ I mean, like you got to understand that like you're dealing with weather conditions, you're dealing with fast, hard conditions and if the greens are rolling at a 14, good luck, I mean it's really, really hard. It's really hard. It's hard for us. I shot 75 and I feel like I played all right.
