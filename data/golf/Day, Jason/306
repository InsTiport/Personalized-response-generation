Q.   You've got your A short game, but maybe your B long game.   Are you going to try to find something overnight?
JASON DAY:   I mean I felt like‑‑ I know exactly how every amateur feels out there today, because I did it today.   I had no idea where I was going with my driver. 
I said earlier, once you start losing confidence with the driver, it slowly goes down the bag, and luckily I had my short game today.   It was nice to save myself a lot.   I missed a lot of greens.   It's just tough when you're missing fairways, especially in Bermuda grass, it's hard to get any sort of spin, hard to judge if it's going to be a fly or not a fly.   It's just a lot more difficult to give yourself opportunities on the greens, to give yourself chances to make birdies and I just didn't do that enough today.

Q.   Shows a lot about your game though that you were able to scratch out even par and you'll start three back tomorrow with a chance to win?
JASON DAY:   Yeah.   I mean, I'm not going to stop until‑‑ I wasn't going to give up today.   That's what I'm going to say.   You can obviously see how I was grinding it out there.   I was stressing over pretty much every shot. 
But you know, I'm three back.   I'm still in it.   I've gotta play the best golf of my life tomorrow to beat 'em.   They're playing some great golf, Billy and Rory.   But this is a tough golf course.   Hopefully we can get some nice weather and get this tournament in.

Q.   Are you excited for that challenge, though, one round to go in the season?
JASON DAY:   Yeah, I'm excited, but I'm like kind of weary because I have no idea where my long game is.   So if it's going to be something like that again tomorrow, it obviously is going to be a lot more stressful because you're trying to compete and win the FedExCup. 
It's difficult when you're just not hitting fairways.   I feel like I'm due because I've had three poor days of hitting.   The short game's been great, so I feel like I'm due to hit it good.

Q.   Today was the first time you were sort of under any real adversity without cold.   Like the first two days you sort of were still playing well.   Did you notice the difference when things were a little tougher today?
JASON DAY:   It just felt the same.   Frustration and all that other stuff, the emotions that run through your body, yeah, it felt the same.   But you know, sometimes it's good to have a caddy there that you've known for a while, just to talk to and really kind of keep you down, you know, just not get too worked up. 
But to have Jase out there was kind of like I said before, it's a blessing in disguise.   He doesn't know it.   I'm saying things to myself, and he's just laughing at me because I'm saying these things, and that kind of takes the pressure off a little bit.

Q.   On the tee today, do you think your subconscious is saying because of your back, I need to hold back just maybe a little bit?
JASON DAY:   Nah, nah.   I've got a good trainer.   We've worked for a week now just to make sure that it's trying to finally get to pain free. 
And there's ‑‑

Q.   (No microphone)?
JASON DAY:   Yeah.   I'm not worried about it, not at all.   I mean I've got more stress worrying about my thumb than the back, so we can get that straight.
But it's out of my head.   I gotta try and win a tournament and that's it. 

Q.   I mean, do you think the mindset tomorrow is, okay, last round, I get through 18, I don't have to worry about these things for a while?
JASON DAY:   Yeah.   I mean, it's something that I have to take care of, obviously, in the offseason. 
But you know, I've got one round to go for this year's schedule.   You know, I'm looking forward to the challenge, and hopefully, you know, I can come out firing, start hitting some more fairways and really not even think about anything other than trying to win the trophy.   Thanks.
