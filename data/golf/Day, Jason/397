 Q. Slow start for both of you guys, but you hung in there. Comments on the day?
 JASON DAY: Yeah, obviously we got off to a slow start, but very, very happy. I fought back and got it under par. Whenever you're shooting under par, you're kind of moving forward around here, which is nice. I feel like I'm in pretty good position for tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it.

 Q. You said yesterday that winning the TOUR Championship was more important to you than winning the FedExCup, but does one weigh on your mind a little more when you're out there?
 JASON DAY: Well, obviously the $10 million weighs on your mind, but the thing is you have to win first before you win the FedExCup. Right now I'm just trying to not focus on anything other than going back and relaxing tonight and then coming back over tomorrow and taking a step at a time.

 Q. How big were those two par-saving putts?
 JASON DAY: Oh, definitely. Hit a pretty solid shot down 17, just went in the bunker there. It was a pretty bad lie, so kind of hit it out to the left there on the fairway and hit a great putt. I hit a good chip shot and then hit a great putt.
 And then 18, hit a solid shot in the middle of the green, and it was weird, the shade -- it's funny how the shade, you look at it and it looks like it's going to be quicker, and it was very, very slow down there, I thought, and it's very tough to tell when there's a lot of shadows and shade and there's flags fluttering in the background.

 Q. Are you ready to go after it tomorrow?
 JASON DAY: You know, I'm just going to try and do the exact same. Whether it's winning this tournament or the next tournament, I've got to just keep everything the same and just take it a step at a time. I can't get ahead of myself. Once I do that, I'm going to seriously make mental errors, and I just don't want to do that.
