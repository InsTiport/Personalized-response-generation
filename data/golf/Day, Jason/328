 Q.   5â€‘under the last two days.   Keeps getting better and better this week?  
JASON DAY:   Yeah, just slowly building.   I feel like it's coming around nicely.   The hitting from tee to green is not bad at all.   Obviously I made a couple of mistakes, just a double bogey and the bogey on the last hole, I thought the bogey on the last hole was a little unlucky with how my stance was.   Normally they feed down to the bottom. But it was kind of on the side of the hill there, obviously, unfortunately to go there and bogey.   
But everything's kind of trending in the right direction.   I feel good about my game.   I just gotta tighten up the putting a little bit and hopefully hole a few more putts tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   And the thumb is feeling good?  
JASON DAY:   No issues with the thumb at all.   So I've been going at it pretty hard for the last two weeks.   And it feels good.   No issues.  
   
 Q.   What's it like playing here, close to where you live?  
JASON DAY:   Oh, I mean, obviously this is my home course.   So it's just good to have family and friends out to watch me play golf.   But I've had good pairing the last three days.   So hopefully I'll get another good pairing tomorrow and I'll go play well.  
   
 Q.   What's your schedule the next week?  
JASON DAY:   I'm going to take off next week.   I just didn't want to jump like straight into it and play a bunch in a row, because I didn't want to kind of overdo the thumb.   
But I'm going to go down to Pinehurst on Thursday and practice Friday, Saturday, Sunday, take the first part of the week off and really try and relax and get ready for the Open.
