 Q.  Tough conditions out there today.  How would you assess your round?  
JASON DAY: You know what, there's a couple of putts there that if I just hit a little bit firmer would have gone in, and I missed an easy one on 2 for a birdie, so it could have easily been a 69 today, but to be honest, it was playing pretty difficult.  I mean now it's probably around 40 degrees or so and it's whipping in there pretty good, so I'm just happy to be done.  I know that there's going to be a lot of work to do tomorrow, but I think we're going to get some pretty tough conditions.  The same conditions that we have had today, tomorrow.   
 Q.  That being said, what's your mindset heading into tomorrow?  What do you need to really do well?  
JASON DAY: I don't have to do anything crazy tomorrow to I think win the tournament, I would say.  I mean, I know that in the final group, playing with those guys playing, I know I can get out early, hopefully post a number, something that's significantly in the 60s.  Like it would be nice to shoot around 67, 68, try and put a little bit of pressure on those guys.  But it's going to be tough tomorrow.  I know that even though it's soft conditions and they're easier fairways to hit and the greens are softer and you can roll some putts in, it's still playing very difficult.  So I just got to, just not even worry about anything else, other than just trying to hit the best shot I can.
