 Q.  Talk about what's going on outside.  
JASON DAY: Yeah, there was trouble lurking there for a second, and then right around 15th horn blew and I was kind of glad that we're in.  Obviously it's a mess out there, and so I'm just trying to get some rest tonight and go into tomorrow.   
 Q.  I heard the decision is to come back at 7:00 tomorrow and I think that's a wise decision, don't you?  
JASON DAY: Definitely.  Yeah, I mean, with all the lightning that is in the area, we only have like an hour or so of daylight left, so I mean obviously it's a good idea to come back tomorrow.   
 Q.  Well, it's quite dark and I really think that judging where it's landing now, Rickie Fowler made the comment it's too dark to play right now.  
JASON DAY: Yeah, it was tough to kind of judge the distance, especially with wedges where you needed to land it.  It was hard to read putts out there.   
But, for me, I just somehow got through it, which is fantastic, so I have a putt on 15 to get to 10.  We'll see how it goes tomorrow.  We've got some scoring holes and some tough ones to finish on, but I'm real happy to be done.
