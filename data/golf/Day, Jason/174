Q. You're a major champion; what's the significance of this victory here now, now THE PLAYERS Champion?
JASON DAY: It's such a big accomplishment for me in my career.  To be able to finally win as No. 1 in the world and then to go wire to wire was very special.  I'm glad I don't have to play the course again.
Q. How much did you have to grind out there early on today during this final round?
JASON DAY: Yeah, it was tough.  I know that it was easy to lose a little bit of focus on the front side, especially with a four-shot lead, and then I just kept on telling myself, just keep yourself in it and give yourself opportunities on the back side, and I played really solid golf on the back side, and very pleased to walk away the champion.
Q. As you say, wire to wire.  Another 54-hole lead converted.  For you what's the secret to you now becoming such an accomplished front-runner out here?
JASON DAY: Just a number of things.  I've always told the media, told everyone before that just sticking to the process and working hard and then obviously learning from the failures that you have along the way.  You always must learn, and I'm just glad to convert another one.  I'm looking forward to plenty more of those, but right now I'm just trying to soak up as much as I can.
