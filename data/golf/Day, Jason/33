Q. Did it feel tough to get anything going on the front nine?
JASON DAY: Yeah, it was just hard to get any sort of -- I mean if you're missing greens then obviously it's hard to get any sort of momentum going.  It was nice to be able to come back and birdie the second hole, but to be honest I played the par-5s poorly.  I shot even par and they're all gettable, and if I would have birdied all four I would have been tied with Rory, but unfortunately I just wasn't good enough today and he was.  So I feel motivated going into next week, knowing that my game is in a half decent spot.
But, yeah, it's -- obviously watching Rory and how he played, tremendous drive down the 18th hole and then a nice second shot in there.  But, yeah, it's definitely disappointing sometimes to see or get a front row seat on a guy winning and it's more disappointing for me.  Obviously I'm very happy for Rory; he played, he's played some tremendous golf over the last few months and he's very deserving of it, so it was nice to see that and I'm positive with how things are going.
Q. Specifically about Rory, he was wobbling a little bit early and what did you see in him as he kind of got things together a little bit?
JASON DAY: Well you just have to get through that kind of that first -- I mean 2 and 4, it's kind of like he made a poor error on 4.  I don't know what kind of lie he had over there, but it seemed like it came out pretty heavy and unfortunately just kind of pulled it.  There was a few shots out there that could have gone either way.  Like the shot on 10, if that would have been left, that would have been further left on the green, that probably would have rolled off and would have been a tough up-and-down but luckily enough it stayed up and he had a good opportunity at birdie.
But the birdie on 9 kind of I think evened him out a little bit and then he knew that with downwind on 11, downwind on 16, there's those gettable holes, and obviously what a great shot on 15 out of the sand from a pretty much a long way back.  I'm not sure what club he hit.  I had 7-iron, and I was about 20 yards in front of him and for him to hit it up there about 13 feet away was pretty impressive.
Q. He's had some issues kind of like final round issues and he's been close, what does it show you when he kind of takes, seizes control like that?
JASON DAY: I know that like everyone wants to talk about -- I mean it's hard to win, it's very difficult to kind of close.  I know that he played well down in Mexico, shooting 67 is a good score, anywhere in the 60s you're doing a good job.  Unfortunately, some of the other ones where he's in the last group he just didn't quite get anything going and I'm assuming, I didn't watch any of it, but I'm assuming he probably hit it pretty good and just didn't capitalize on the opportunities.  At the start of the season when I was looking at his setup just on TV he just looked a lot more relaxed and you could tell that he was, just his demeanor was, it was a lot different compared to last year, and it was just a matter of time, it was going to happen.
Q. What was it about the front nine that everybody had difficulty with today?
JASON DAY: Well, it's just the wind in out of the left on 5, in out of the left on 7.  That opening tee shot is not easy, it's a long hole.  So with all that said there's two opportunities, two to three opportunities, 2, 4 and 9, if you can get away with getting some birdies out of that and just parring the rest that's all you can ask for.
Q. When you have a player like Rory and you've been in this position where you've been close so many times how difficult is it to stay patient?
JASON DAY: It's more so everyone else trying to be impatient for you.  Deep down inside you know that you've had good, he's had great finishes, second place here and a lot of Top-5's, and then finally capitalize on it and won.  But it's just, deep down inside you know that you want to do it, sometimes you can get in your own way and want it too much, but that wasn't a factor here, that wasn't him.  He knew that he was playing some good golf and it was just a matter of time for him to be able to take those opportunities and he obviously did it on a grand stage like he did today.
