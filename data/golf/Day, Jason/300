 Q.  Here with Jason Day.  Jason, you had a chance, you hit a beautiful second shot into 18 that released just a little bit too much.  And then the lie was horrific.  JASON DAY: Yeah, there was no way I was going to get 2-iron there, so obviously take the penalty out of play and I hit my 3-wood and I really tried to go for that back right bunker, because anything in the rough is obviously difficult to stop downhill. So, I just missed the bunker and just got a horrific lie off the back.  I got a little lucky with it staying up. I'm just glad I'm in at 9.  So we'll see how it goes.  Obviously there's a few guys out there playing still.   Q.  Well it's tough, we started out with the Farmers Insurance Open and we ended up with the Farmers Insurance U.S. Open this week.  JASON DAY: Yeah, it was a difficult, difficult course.  Both sides played pretty difficult.  But we had great weather, which perfect for the greens and the firmness of the greens were very, very difficult as well and if you're not driving it straight, it's very difficult to make any birdies and try and get the momentum rolling your way.  So I'm just glad I got it in.   Q.  What are you going to do between now and a potential playoff?  JASON DAY: I think I'm just go to the locker room real quick, have a look and around and see how the guys go and maybe come up and warm-up a little bit if need be.
