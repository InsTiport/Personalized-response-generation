JASON DAY: It didn't stop raining the whole time.  It was just tough because, by the end of everything, it was wet.  My whole bag is wet.  The clubs are wet.  It was a tough finish actually.  With a little bit of wind and some rain and being cold, 17 is playing tough.  18 is difficult, obviously.   
Yeah, I know, I wish I could have the last four holes back, but it is what it is.  Hopefully, the lead doesn't get too far out.  Get some nice weather tomorrow.  Even if it's windy, as long as it's not wet, you know, try and get myself back into it.   
 Q.  When was the last time you played a left-handed bunker shot?  
JASON DAY: Well, the left-handed chip is what brought on the bunker, but just joking around really.  My thought was like, if I could just get it somewhere just short, if I could get it on the green, great.  If I could just get it somewhere short, that's not too bad, then I could just -- the worry was going long and having that chip coming back up the hill.   
So a little bit disappointed actually to walk off with a bogey in the end because I gave myself a good chip at it and hit a poor putt.
