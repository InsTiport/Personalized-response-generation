Q.   Jason, a third round which took over 17 hours to complete, how would you assess your play?
    JASON DAY:   Long time.   It was good.   I actually hit the ball great today.
    You know what, I had a lot of straight putts, which I think are very, very difficult to read on greens like this, especially when there's been a lot of footprints on there.   Greens are a little softer, the ball starts bouncing around.   So it's a premium on, you know, obviously getting it started on the right line.
    Sometimes it's harder to read straight putts than curved putts because you know exactly what they're going to do.

Q.   Obviously the situation on the golf course means you're going to go out and play aggressively.   How do you decide how aggressively?
    JASON DAY:   Just gotta go out there and try to shoot as low as I can.   The more opportunities you give yourself on the greens, the more likely you're going to have more birdies.
    But you know, you have to be aggressive out there because of how soft it is.   You can obviously tell by the third‑round scores that there was a lot of guys under par, and it's only going to be deeper, especially with the fourth round and everything starting to heat up.

Q.   Some of your challengers are way ahead of you on the golf course, in terms of an hour, 40 minutes ahead of you.   How do you approach that situation?
    JASON DAY:   I've got‑‑ you know, once they're done, I've got more opportunities coming in.   So that's the way you gotta look at it.

Q.   Wish you luck.
