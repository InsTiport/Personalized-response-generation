 Q. Nice round, 6-under. Just a couple keys to the round. 
 JASON DAY: A couple of keys, I drove it pretty straight and I hit greens, but the putting -- I putted really good today, so that's pretty much what held it together. I had a lot of good up-and-downs, and I just went out there and made a lot of birdies, which was good.

 Q. It's got to feel good to get the round done. It was obviously a long day yesterday. Talk about the conditions of the course and how that favored probably really throwing some darts. 
 JASON DAY: Exactly right. The greens are really soft right now, so are the fairways. It's a little bit sluggy out there on the fairways in some parts, but it's dried out pretty good since yesterday. 
 But it's like target golf out there right now. It's not spinning too much, and you're just throwing darts at the pin, which is good.

 Q. You're obviously in a great position. It's a totally different day. It's like two different worlds, beautiful, sunny skies today. Are you going to change the approach at all?
 JASON DAY: No, I'm just going to go out and play. Obviously everyone has got a game plan to suit this course. I'm just going to go out there and try and birdie the par-5s and grab a couple birdies coming in.
