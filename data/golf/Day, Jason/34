 Q. How different these two days, how weird is golf sometimes?  
JASON DAY: Golf is very strange, even though yesterday I was disappointed and discouraged after the round knowing that I could have‑‑ I let the lead slip away even more than what I should have.   
15 was obviously disappointing yesterday. But it was kind of similar to what I had today. It was just kind of slowly building, building, building. And seemed like little momentum steps, and obviously doubling the last, the 15th hole, and then birdieing the last hole was just not what I wanted. And today I just had one bogey on the card, but I just played really solid coming in. And I missed ‑‑ from 11 to 14 I missed some crucial putts, just burnt on the edge, and I wish they would have gone in because I think it would have really given this really a good scare.   
I don't know how it's going to go. The guys are at 12‑under, they're going down 15 now. And I played 7‑under yesterday. I shot 5‑under today. So yeah, we'll see.   
   
 Q. And you started on the back nine. You went into another gear, you actually thought you had a chance of winning then?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I just wanted to see how it went. And obviously coming off yesterday like I said I was disappointed and got through the front side in 2‑under. And then I didn't really start taking notice of the leaderboard until the backside. If I can shoot 4‑under on the backside, that may give it a sniff. And I shot 3‑under in the end. But just played very, very solid tee to green. Putted well and I'm very pleased with how things went.
