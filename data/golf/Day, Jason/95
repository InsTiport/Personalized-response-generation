 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY: Got to wear the right pants and right shoe combo with it.  If you wear golf shoes with these pants, they don't look that great.  So they look all right with these shoes.  I'm happy with them.   
They look good on TV.  I just watched it on replay.  You know what, all day today was -- it was kind of back and forth, but I think I had four birdies and one bogey -- I'm sorry, four birdies and three bogeys.  I think that's what it was.  Was that right?   
Yeah, I think, you know, it's really hard because for the most part I hit most irons going up to 15.  And then you pull driver out and it feels foreign, to a sense, that you just haven't pulled out driver for a while.  And I was talking to Zach about it, almost you feel like you're kind of out of momentum because you haven't hit a driver for most of the round.  And I hit three poor drives, going up 15, 16, 17.  Got myself out of position on all those holes, and didn't play well.  Those are the holes where you can kind of get some back.  And unfortunately didn't get them back.  But I made a good putt on 18, which was a nice way to finish.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY: You know, every time I come over here the ground is so hard.  They need to get out and water it a little bit (laughing).  It's so hard, and then once again I'm always in the wispy stuff.  It's not very good on the wrist when you're hitting it out of the hay.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY: No, it was great out there.  Very lucky, you know, with the draw today.  Not too sure how things are going to progress tomorrow for us.  I think it's going to be pretty poor the whole day.  But that's The Open Championship.   
But I thought the conditions this afternoon were great.  It was a little breezy for the most part.  But the sun came out and it was an enjoyable walk out there, really.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY: Kind of anything tough, really.  I feel like I play better in worse weather.  But saying that, I really don't want to walk around in the rain tomorrow in 35-miles-an-hour wind and the cold.  But if I have to, I have to.  That's just what you have to do to try to win The Open Championship.   
And once again, I think that currently we are on the better side of the draw, compared to this morning.  And that's the luck of the draw sometimes.  We've just got to wake up tomorrow and see how it comes.  You've just got to wake up every single day and try to battle not only the golf course but the elements and try to beat the course.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY: It's early days, you know.  Getting back to the last question, the weather is a big factor when it comes to scoring.  And if we have what it's supposed to get tomorrow, it's going to be a very, very difficult task to shoot anything under par.  I think it may blow from what we had in the practise rounds, and I think that's a tougher wind to play in because a lot of the longer par-4s play into the wind and make it a very difficult task to try to par those.   
The main goal is to try to get yourself in contention come Sunday.  So there's still a lot of golf to be played.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I do.  Just got to be patient with myself.  And understand that it's been a while since I've been in a position to contend other than the Byron Nelson this year.  It's been pretty dry.  But for the most part very pleased with how things went out there today.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY: Yeah.  It was good, yeah.  It felt good all the way leading up to -- not all the way, but through the mid part of my round I felt great.  I started seeing the shots come out exactly the way I wanted to.  And that's really good things because I've been working very hard at home trying to make sure that what I see out there and how I hit it -- it won't come out perfect every single time, but during the middle part of my round I started gaining a lot of confidence.  And obviously it helps hitting fairways, too.  I feel good about my game, I've just got to be patient and let things unfold.  Thanks.
