Q. After that really hot start on the front nine, you ended up with 69.  What's your takeaway from day one?
JASON DAY: It's under par.  That's all I can really take from it.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just been a bit delayed, so glad to get it in and get some sleep tonight and get back to it tomorrow.
Q. How tough is it to get restarted when you're sitting in the rain room for four hours and you have to get loose again and you're in the middle of a round?
JASON DAY: Well, it's just the waiting part.  Obviously the weather hovering above us just wouldn't go away.  It had just been a very long wait, and you just want to get in and finish.  I had two holes left.  Yeah, I mean, clearly a little frustrated, but looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. After taking a week off, how close do you think you are to getting back in form?
JASON DAY: Well, I've just got to manage myself out there.  Obviously this is going to be bit of a tough week with these double start rounds.  Some guys are going out to play 27 holes tomorrow, or some guys have got to play 36.  With that said, I might be able to sneak in nine holes and play 27 on Saturday, but I've just got to stay positive, keep moving forward, and see how it goes from there.
