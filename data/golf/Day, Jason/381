Q.   (Away from mic.)
JASON DAY:   Yeah, just two bad swings.   That's it.   A little upset right now but trying not to say anything stupid.   Just two bad swings, really.   Bad stroke on 18. 
I'm going to hit it short on 18 from now on, short of that water from now on.   I don't care if it's blowing 100 miles an hour; I'm going to hit it short. 

Q.   (Away from mic.)
JASON DAY:   Really should be hitting a cut against that, especially with the left or right, you should be hitting a cut against it, and it went in the water.   Not a good day, bad swing at the wrong time.   Frustrating. 

Q.   On this course you have to be feeling pretty good about what you did.   (Away from mic.)
JASON DAY:   No, no, definitely‑‑ I played well the whole day.   Obviously the double on 18, but I played really, really solid golf.   I hit it nicely. 
I think it's very positive going into the next three days.   It's not where I want to be, but it's under par and it's in the right direction. 
We'll see how the weather obviously goes the next three days, but it's only going to get tougher with the heat.   I'm in a good spot, I just got to be positive and stay with it.
