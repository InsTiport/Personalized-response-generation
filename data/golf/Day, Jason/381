  JASON DAY:   I think obviously the only blemish was obviously the missed greened on 18, but I thought I was going to shoot 59 today just the way things were going.   
I was hitting it good; I was putting it good, too.   Just didn't capitalize on the opportunities I had on the back nine.  
   
 Q.   You had a three‑foot birdie putt on the 10th green that would have tied you for the lead and it just snapped off to the left‑hand side.   
JASON DAY:   Yeah, I can think about all the putts that I missed today.   During the first three rounds I missed a ton as well.  
I'm very excited the way I played over the last two days, even the last four days.   But I'm looking forward to McGladrey's.   You know, I feel like I'm going to win soon.  
   
 Q.   Absolutely.   So you were thinking of the 59 and the win out here.   You probably had to shoot something in the 50s.   Did you think about that?  
JASON DAY:   Probably 58 I'm guessing that I had to shoot.   We picked 24, and the right now it's 24.   Yeah, I was thinking 58 to try and at least have a sniff at it.
