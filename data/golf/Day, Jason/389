 Q. Just talk about a bit of emotion at the end, great back and forth, probably a great atmosphere. 
 JASON DAY: It was fun. Obviously they had a 2-up lead early and then we got it back through 10 and 11. They got another 2-up lead and then you know, got a birdie back on the par 5 there, and unfortunately on the 16th, but I made a bomb on 17. I was so excited. I was pumped for it. Hunter just walked in and did it so easily. And you just -- he just stood up there and he had to make the putt. And he did, which was good for him.

 Q. Good afternoon though for the team as a whole. 
 JASON DAY: We hope we can pull something through and maybe hopefully win that one. You know, hopefully -- we just need to get some rest. I think we are all tired after today. We are all wet, tired, and we just need to get some rest and then coming into tomorrow's round and just let things happen. We just have to play our own game. I think if we can just play our own game and keep the ball in front of us, I think we might have a chance of winning this. But the American Team are very, very tough. They have got a lot of good players on their side. 

 Q. Talk about the difference of conditions from yesterday to today. Night and day, right? 
 JASON DAY: And that's just Melbourne golf. That's just what it is. Ever since -- I've grown up in Australia, before I came down and played Melbourne golf, sand belt golf courses, is that the weather can change so quick. You know, four seasons in one day pretty much. It's amazing. 
 But that's just how it is, and that just goes to show how good of a golf course this really is, is that you can play it in all different conditions and it's still fun to play.
