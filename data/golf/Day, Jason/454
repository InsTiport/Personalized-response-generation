  Q. Jason, couple thoughts about the round, I guess.  
 JASON DAY: You know, played great overall. Hit a lot of greens on the back-9, which was the front-9, and I holed a lot of good putts but a couple bogies, 2, 3-putts on the front-9, but overall pretty good.  
  
  Q. Jason, the silent 5-under par 65 today, got you in a good spot.  
 JASON DAY: Yeah. It's in a great spot. I'm not too sure how I'm sitting on the leaderboard, but starting the day at even par and finished at 5-under. It's great to move forward.  
  
  Q. What's the key to solving the puzzle here at TPC Southwind?  
 JASON DAY: Well, I guess I played really well today, just hit a lot of fairways and hit a lot of greens. Gave myself a lot of opportunities. But if you can put yourself in a right positions off the tee, you can get in the right place on the green as well.  
 I think today, like with the wind, you know, it's down a little bit this morning. Normally it's blowing from 10 to 15 miles an hour and kind of switches sometimes on you. It was good out there today. I think if the wind picks up this afternoon, might play a little bit tougher out there.  
  
  Q. These greens look to be pretty speedy. You have to respect them.  
 JASON DAY: Yes. Obviously coming off Memorial last week, it feels like ten times slower. You do have to still respect them going downhill, down grain. They are very quick. It's coming back from Memorial kind of helped a little bit.  
  
  Q. Jason, solid round. Keep it up over the weekend.
