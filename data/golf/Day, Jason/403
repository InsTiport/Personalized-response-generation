   JASON DAY: The greens are firm. They've got -- I think they have the SubAir system here, so if it rains, they can suck all that moisture out pretty quick. But other than that, the rough isn't too long, but it's Bermuda, so it sinks straight to the ground and you can get some bad lies. But overall the course is playing very good.  
  
  Q. Seemed like it was just an ideal day for scoring.   
 JASON DAY: Yeah, there were some tough pins out there, but there were some accessible pins. The PGA TOUR set it up really, I think, fair. If they do this over the next few days, I'm not too sure what's going to win.   
  
  Q. Is there any sort of competition going on between you and Sendo?  
 JASON DAY: No, no, not really. It's just like I'm going to go out and play my game. In the end I have to try and do the best I can.
