  JASON DAY:   Yeah, it was very, very tough out there.   There was a lot of wind and a lot of sand, and I don't really wear sunglasses, and I haven't worn sunglasses for a long, long time, and I actually went into the pro shop this morning and bought some because I've never played in this kind of dust before.   So it was interesting.   It was a new experience for me.  
   
 Q.   It gets into every crevice, doesn't it?  
JASON DAY:   It does.   My hair feels like they're dreadlocks by the time I get off the course.   No wonder they give me so much shampoo and conditioner at the hotel.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
JASON DAY:   Exactly.   I just tried to clean it up.   I look about 20 years younger and I feel lighter now, which is good.  
   
 Q.   Of course, the other change from last week.   Didn't get on particularly well in Abu Dhabi.   
JASON DAY:   No.   
   
 Q.   You weren't firing.   
JASON DAY:   Yeah.   I had a month and a half off and was kind of a little rusty.   Obviously the first tournament back is a little rusty just trying to get back into the swing of things.   I actually played well last week.   I just didn't score as well as I'd like to.   
And today was a very, very solid round, I hit a lot of good quality shots out there, and I chipped and putted well, too, which was nice.  
   
 Q.   Is there something to do with having to be so concentrated as well, because you know you're penalized here?  
JASON DAY:   That's the thing.   The conditions out there were so tough that you can't switch off.   If you switch off, then you make a mental error and you make a mistake, and then the momentum goes and you start going backwards if you can't get the momentum rolling your way.   
So today was more of a grind, and that's kind of what I like.   I like to kind of grind it out a little bit, and you know, I just played good golf today which was nice.  
   
 Q.   To wrap it up, as someone who's played well, give me an appreciation of that leading score from Gonzalo Fdez‑CastaÃ±o.   
JASON DAY:   Yeah, and he was only a few groups in front of me, which was very, very amazing, in conditions this afternoon.   
I'm not too sure how it was this morning for the guys, but I'm guessing it was a lot tougher this afternoon, and from what I hear, I think the morning guys are going to get a lot of the wind tomorrow afternoon, so hopefully we can get out there before the wind tomorrow, but that's highly doubtful.
