Q.   Pretty impressive, coming in a little under the radar, and could have been a lot lower. 
JASON DAY:   Yeah, I had a couple 3â€‘putts out there.   I felt like I played good. I've been doing my work obviously to try and turn my golf game around a little bit.   I did some good work last week and did some really good prep coming into this week. 
So, you know, it was a good start.   I'm just hoping the weather holds the next few days.   It definitely holds if you hit good shots.   That's why the scores are the way they are right now.   I'm really pleased with how I played today.

Q.   Talk about the golf course. 
JASON DAY: Like I said, there's opportunities out there.   You still have to golf your ball and if you're not playing well, then it's definitely going to be a challenge.   That's why I love playing the PGA Championship.   Just you have to, it challenges all parts of your game, and if you're not quite on top of things, you're going to struggle. 
Like I said, I got off to a good start and I'm happy where I'm at.
