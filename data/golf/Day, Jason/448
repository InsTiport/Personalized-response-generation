  Q. A couple comments on the round?  
 JASON DAY: Just a couple of mental mistakes, but overall I hit the ball really well. I missed the green on the last and got up-and-down, which was nice. I only had one three-putt on 10, and that was a bogey, and that was the only bogey of the day, which was obviously nice. If I can keep those bogeys to a minimum, I think that will be really, really nice around here because it's a very tough course. It's firm and fast out there, so it's only going to get tougher over the next few days.  
  
  Q. Is there anything that fits your eye as far as this golf course?  
 JASON DAY: You know, there's a lot of drivers out there, and I think if you can -- the rough is pretty brutal out there. If you can hit it pretty high and long, you can get down far enough where you can have a wedge in so it's not as -- not like you're coming in there with a 7-iron and have to land it like 20, 30 short of the green and run it up. You know, the course, it suits my eye, but it's still early on in the week.  
  
  Q. Are you hitting a lot of wedges?  
 JASON DAY: I was hitting a fair amount of wedges. I'm not too sure, maybe I think eight wedges, wedge shots into the green.
