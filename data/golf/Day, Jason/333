  JASON DAY:   I just wasn't quite as sharp as I'd like today.   I had a 4‑putt on 10.   I felt like I didn't play that bad.   Just the putter wasn't very good.   I have to see how it goes tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY:   It did.   It really did.   Well, it's kind of hard to prep for greens like this.   They're fast, as fast as they can get.   
I came in here last Monday.   I should be prepared for it.   But I just wasn't‑‑ didn't have the best stuff today.   I can only just look at things and see what I can do to improve and go on from there.  
   
 Q.   A couple of guys have bogeyed 16, 17 and 18 with similar scores.   Does it make you better that you kind of stabled out?  
JASON DAY:   Well, I'm not going to quit until the week's done.   I still feel like I've got a fighting chance.   And I think the leader is at 4‑under.   I'm only at 3‑over right now.   And I definitely have a lot of golf to be played.   We'll see how it goes.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY:   No, no trouble.   Everything felt great.   I've just got to kind of work out the kinks with the putter.   One of the main reasons I didn't putt that great, usually I couldn't quite see the ball going in the hole, and it was a bit of a struggle seeing my lines.   That's just golf.   Some days you have it.   Some days you don't.   I've got to keep working on it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY:   I feel great.   I felt good to start with.   I got a bit‑‑ it was a terrible drive on 8, I made bogey there.   It can happen pretty quick around here if you let it happen.   So you've got to make sure you're on top of things.   The stretch through 9 through Amen Corner is pretty difficult.   You can rack up a number there.  
I just have to look at what I did today and try and improve on it tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY:   Well, I've just got to be patient.   It totally depends on how they set the course up.   I feel like today's pins were pretty difficult, with how the greens were this afternoon, they were bouncing pretty hard.   The greens were rolling pretty quick.   I think in Major events like this you definitely have to be more patient than aggressive.
