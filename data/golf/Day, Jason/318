  JASON DAY: It's difficult to see what kind of the cut was.  Obviously teeing off this morning.  I knew I had to birdie one of the two par 5s coming in.  It was difficult to birdie 17 with how much wind there was coming from behind.  To even get something to stop, you had to be on the right side of the fairway to even attack the pin.  That was obviously crucial on the last hole to make it.Q. (Inaudible.)JASON DAY: I think I made a bit of a ^  of it yesterday.  It was still tough conditions blowing 10 to 15 miles an hour, but it was gusting out there 20-plus.  One to two clubs, at least.  And it was very difficult, but Friday normally, yeah, everyone kind of comes back, just to cut line.  And then at a major championship and with how the conditions are, it's a pretty tough finish.  Even though it's a par 5, you've got a lot of out of bounds to the right.  And most guys will probably go out left. I feel good about how I played today.  Obviously a lot better than yesterday, but we'll see how it goes, because the course is playing difficult out there with how windy it is.  But I'm still sticking around.Q. (Inaudible.)JASON DAY: Yeah, I feel like I've got a question mark over my head right now.  It's difficult.  It's something that you have to learn and experience in tournament play.  You can come over and play social rounds and get used to the course this way.  But it's nothing like playing in a tournament on links golf.  It's very fun.  It's challenging and fun.  It's very frustrating, but there's some luck involved with -- you have to really know your game plan and stick to your game plan out there.  And obviously it can change in a heartbeat.  You get certain winds.  I hit a lot more drivers today than I hit yesterday.  Just only because I was hitting it better today. But I've got two more days.  I still have to be patient out there.  It's very difficult to try and attack and be aggressive with these pin locations.  I've just got to try to give myself a lot more opportunities on the greens and hopefully putt a lot better.Q. (Inaudible.)JASON DAY: It wasn't the thumb, it was the wrist.  I took a practice swing on 5 and something popped in my left side and it was like kind of a tingling sensation through my hand, and it went straight up to my elbow.  And kind of bugged me for the rest of the day.  And I've got a strap today obviously.  And I went to see the guys in the Tour van, and they helped me out last night.  I was asking about anti-inflammatories, as well.  But it's not like the other injuries I've had.  I've had wrist injuries before.  And it just didn't feel like it was -- like it was a harm to me.  So I just wanted to get through the round and see the guys, see how it went. And today it was only one shot where it felt bad.Q. (Inaudible.)JASON DAY: It was on a practice swing.  It was on a tee.  It was early in the round, though.Q. That must have given you a pretty good scare yesterday?JASON DAY: Yeah, it's funny because you come over here and you just -- it's very firm here.  The ground is very firm.  And then you hit in the long stuff and you're kind of gouging out of it.  It's funny, because I had the exact same problem last year, but it was in my right side.  So every time I come here I know that I have to -- my forearm is kind of loosened up.  Once they tighten up, something pops in my wrist and goes up my elbow.  So that's kind of one thing that I need to make sure or hit more fairways, that's probably a good idea.  Hit more fairways.Q. (Inaudible.)JASON DAY: No, no, no.  Yesterday I just tried to forget about it.  And then today I hit it much better today.Q. (Inaudible.)JASON DAY: We're getting some rain tomorrow, they're calling I think five to 10 miles an hour winds.  I think it's a lie.  We had five to ten mile an hour winds supposedly on Thursday, and it got pretty gusty out there.  With rain and wind it will be tough tomorrow and I'm not too sure what Sunday is looking like.  It's going to be sunny, but I don't know how much wind there's going to be. You take what you can get.  And right now hopefully I stay where I'm at or improve.  I'm not too sure how it's going to be out there.  But I definitely have a shot at it.  I've just got to keep myself in there and just gut it out.
