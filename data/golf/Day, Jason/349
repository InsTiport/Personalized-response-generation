  JASON DAY:   We hit it great off the tee and we were giving ourselves a lot of opportunities for birdies, but just good to get the win.   
   
 Q.   All the times you have played here‑‑ in all the dozens of tournaments you played ‑‑  
JASON DAY:   Out of all of them I can't remember how many times‑‑ it was good to remember how muchit does break.   And Graham ‑‑ holing putts for me, we just read a good line and I hit the putt, and it was on a perfect line.   
   
 Q.   How far was the putt on‑‑  
JASON DAY:   It was a least two, two and a half feet of break.   It was pretty big.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you step up for big moments like that?   
JASON DAY:   I love it.   It's exciting.   Ever since I was a little kid, I always wanted to hit the big, clutch putts and it was great to have that chance to hit that putt.   
   
 Q.   Did you get a read off Graham's putt for par on the last?   
JASON DAY:   What happened was we wanted to make sure he got the par and I could just make a run at it and it was perfect.
