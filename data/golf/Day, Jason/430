  Q. Obviously a great round, never broke 70 here before.   
 JASON DAY: Yeah, shattered.   
  
  Q. Shattered that today. Just what went right?  
 JASON DAY: You know, the last two days I've actually hit it better than what the stats show. I missed greens and missed fairways but only a couple of yards off the fairway or on the fringe of the greens.   
 But, you know, today I just had everything going well. I hit the driver okay, but my irons were great to the greens and putted well. That's the big thing is I putted better today than I did the last two days.  
  
  Q. 7-under, who knows what the lead is going to be at the end of the day, obviously got to make you feel good heading into tomorrow, regardless of where the lead is?  
 JASON DAY: Yeah, I think wherever the lead is, I'm going to try to shoot for that. I'm very happy with how I played today, because I felt like it's been coming closer and closer. I'm just glad I holed the putts today.
