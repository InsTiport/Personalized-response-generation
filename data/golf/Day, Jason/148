Q. It's always nice to finish with an eagle.  Tell me about the 19-footer.
JASON DAY: Yeah, really just I felt good about it, just thinking about what I did yesterday.  It was a right-to-left putt.  You know what, I was just thinking about how funny this game is, to be able to miss a 5-foot putt on 16 for birdie and then hole a 19 -foot putt on the last for eagle.  It's just a strange game.
But yeah, it felt good.  Obviously to be able to go out and shoot 69 this morning is a pretty decent score I think, and hopefully that shoots me up a little bit and I can get a couple more hours of sleep tomorrow.
Q. A little bit better off the tee.  You missed six fairways and only missed six greens.
JASON DAY: That's nice.  I definitely kept the ball out in front of me today.  It was easier obviously today teeing off early.  Greens were a lot more receptive.  The fairways were a lot more receptive, as well, so they weren't bouncing into the rough or they weren't bouncing into the rough over the greens.
When things are kind of receptive but still firm, you can obviously attack a few more pin locations.  I felt good.  I was actually swinging the club well off the tee.  Gave myself the opportunities and made a couple bogeys but for the most part kept in front of me.
Q. Tell me some holes we should be aware of, the hole location on 12, right on top of the bunker looks difficult.
JASON DAY: The one on 12, the pin location on 13 is very difficult if you are going for it in two.  Obviously the water runs 45, so you have to make sure you hit a good one shot if you are going for it in two.
For the most part, everything is out in front of you.  There are a few pin locations on the front side, especially with this wind picking up now, I think with the par 3, the first par 3, which is I think four, just over.  If you leave yourself short there, it's a very difficult up-and-down.  But the saving grace there is you've got the wind there.
But for the most part, everything is kind of out in front of you.
Q. The read on that putt today --
JASON DAY: I half-winded up I think.  My usual thing is where I go from behind the ball and then I go behind the cup and look from the side, behind the ball and the side and that was about it and just went and hit it.
I was just saying earlier that it's just a funny game.  I didn't -- hit a shot from 235 yards on 13, hit it on the green  and then turn around on the next hole and miss the green with a 9-iron.  Miss a putt from five feet on 16 for birdie and hole a putt from 19 feet on the last for eagle.  It's just a strange old game.
But very, very boring 65 today, which I like that stress-free kind of stuff.  I think tomorrow's round is very important for me to play well, especially going into next week's last major championship.  Hopefully it gives me a boost of confidence going to that week.
Q. Getting yourself ready for the PGA, how much of that did you do today?
JASON DAY: Obviously you've got to play well.  If you don't play well, then you are kind of going into next week's tournament going, where is the state of my game.  Today was a step in the right direction, being able to come back and shoot 69 after a poor round yesterday, and hopefully I can kind of improve on that tomorrow.  If I can improve on that tomorrow, I should feel pretty good about my game going into next week.
Q. Were you aware of getting as close to DJ as you can --
JASON DAY: Not right now, because I can't control what he does, unfortunately.  I wish I could (laughter).  Yeah, I can't control what he does.  I mean, it's definitely on me for what I did yesterday.  I played great Thursday.  Played good today.  Obviously the second round kind of shot me out of the tournament right now.  But you never know what happens tomorrow.
Like I said, I really want a good round tomorrow just to try to get the confidence in the right direction.  If I can't win this week, I'd much rather win next week.
