Q.   Congratulations on a grueling day and a grueling match. 
JASON DAY:   I mean, I won three holes straight, and we were kind of laughing and giggling out there for the first nine, and once we turned the corner on 10, everything got real serious.   He obviously made a couple of good clutch pars on 16 and 17.
