JASON DAY: Obviously I've got a lot of work ahead of me, but I was a lot better today, which was nice.  Hit a lot of better quality shots.   
Yeah, drove it good.  Hit a lot of good iron shots and made a lot of birdies.  When I was out of position, got myself back in.  Nice eagle on 7.  And I played good.   
 Q.  What was the course setup like today?  
JASON DAY: I think you'll see a lot more low scores in the early part of the round, early part of the morning, I think.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's definitely out there if you get yourself on the fairway and put yourself on the greens.   
But as the day goes along, the poa annua starts to grow, and there's a lot of traffic that goes along the greens, so the greens won't be as smooth.  And the greens will firm out a little bit more.   
I don't think it's going to be too windy.  So I think there's definitely scores to be had out there for the guys, but obviously it just gets a little tireder as the weekend goes along.   
 Q.  You wanted to play well here.  Does this do better today, a day like this?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I think it was just -- I always -- I guess I just always struggle just trying to get off to a good start here.  And I seem to play okay on the weekend, but I think I just give myself a little bit too much pressure coming out.  And unfortunately I wish I could control that a little bit better.  I think I just need to relax a little bit more, but still understand that I need to go out and execute the shots.   
The way I played today was totally different than the first two days.  I need more of that going forward when I come back every year.   
 Q.  Does it surprise you, given your success --  
JASON DAY: I think it's out there.  I just haven't been able to put four good rounds together here.  That's the hardest thing for me.  I'll either have two and a half, three rounds that are really solid and then have one really bad one.  So I just need to be able to string the four rounds together and if I can do that I'll be in contention.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JASON DAY: I'll probably get there Friday, Friday night.  And then probably play nine holes Sunday.  And probably do the same -- it's a long walk around there.  I've been there once, but I didn't play.  I was over doing a Lexus outing.  I was on the par-3 hitting shots.  But really beautiful-looking course.   
It's going to be interesting to see the whole golf course because I haven't seen it yet.  But I heard it can play very long and windy out there.  I'm very keen to get out there and play some holes just to see what the feel is like.  I typically like U.S. Open golf courses.  I like being up in Wisconsin.  The last major that I won was obviously at Whistling Straits, so hopefully some good memories from that going forward.   
 Q.  Did you have a good reception today?  
JASON DAY: I got announced out of Columbus, Ohio.  That was a first.  Usually it's Brisbane, Australia, but obviously Columbus is my home.  It was nice to be announced out there and obviously everyone yelled, Go Cavs, because of Thursday's round.   
Hoping for a good game coming up here, Sunday.   
 Q.  Is your game ready for a major?  
JASON DAY: I think it's rounding out nicely.  It's hard to tell.  Guys that were -- you look at DJ, he was coming off firing and then something happened to him in Augusta and just hasn't quite got back to it.  But he'll come around.   
And then there's guys like Kim who has missed six straight cuts and wins the PLAYERS.  Golf short game is really finicky when it comes to stuff like that.   
But I think that my form is coming around nicely.  Obviously got on the back end of Byron and playing well today, and hopefully I can play well tomorrow, that will give me a good boost going into the off week, so I can train and practice a little bit harder and make sure I get some rest before heading to the U.S. Open.   
 Q.  That was the first time ever someone's announced you at the start --  
JASON DAY: Yeah.  The other one was we kind of -- we conned one of the starters to announce me out of Awesomeville, Australia, but there's no Awesomeville, Australia (laughter).  It was at Pebble, we conned him into saying it.  That was a first.   
It was good to be announced out of Columbus.  It's my home, and the people are great.  I've had a lot of support out here this week and looking forward to tomorrow.
