JASON DAY: Everyone want to talk about the shot on 5.
Q. On Shot Link it says shot hit to unknown.  Does that pretty much sum it up?
JASON DAY: It was in the unknown.  I got off to a good start today, but man, I just -- it's one of those swings, it kind of just got away from me a little bit.
But, I mean, like I said before, I wish I could say that I was a machine and I can hit it straight down the gut every single time, 315 yards.  But unfortunately, as humans we're going to make some errors.
There was two swings I would love to have take back today.  That was on 5 and 16.  So, I could possibly get away with hitting 3-wood down 16, but not hitting 3-wood down 5, it's just too long of a hole there today.  But it didn't really worry me too much, I made mistakes before.  To make triple was pretty disappointing, but it's early on in the tournament, so I can't dwell on that.
Q. You're still under par at the end of the day.
JASON DAY: Yeah, and that's it.  I just -- I'm just trying to play the best I can to keep it under par.  It was a good save on the last hole to keep myself under par.  So that's a nice momentum going into tomorrow's round.
Q. I guess your luck was due to be a little off given that it did bounce off a tree and jump over that fence.  So that didn't help.
JASON DAY: No, that didn't help.  But once again, things happen.  It's just unfortunate that it happened that way, but I can't, I can't think about it.  It's done.  I just got to focus on trying to shoot a low score tomorrow and move on from there.
So if I can do that, that's how the best players in the world do it and if I can do that, hopefully I'm close to the lead by Sunday.
Q. Given how you started, how surprised were you by that tee shot and secondly, did it, maybe not rattle you, but does it kind of throw you off a little bit?
JASON DAY: I know 5 and 6 are very difficult holes.  Getting off to a great start, I never thought I would get off to a good start like that, even just barely missing the putt on 4.  It didn't really rattle me because I stood up there and hit the drive nice down the -- still in the right rough, but I still a good drive and I didn't expect it to kind of squirt right on me on the second shot.
So, I know this course is very difficult.  I didn't expect to see Henrik shoot 7-under.  He was 8-under and he could possibly have gone lower, but I didn't see that.  But it is Thursday, and we still have three more rounds to go and it's a long way to the finish line.  So, I just got to keep kind of checking the boxes and keep moving forward and not get too far in front of myself and just keep moving forward trying to make as many birdies as I can.
Q. It's a chip away at a golf course though, isn't it?  It's not like you can come out and do what he did today.
JASON DAY: It's one of those golf courses that you need to be driving it straight, because if you're hitting it out of the rough, it's very difficult to hit it next to the pin.  The greens aren't setup to -- especially with this length of rough, greens aren't setup to get it anywhere close to pin locations like that.
So, if you hit it, if you're driving it straight, it definitely helps the opportunity of getting a lot more birdie chances.  I felt like I hit the ball okay today, pretty solid.  But overall, it's something where I just got to kind of improve on for tomorrow.
