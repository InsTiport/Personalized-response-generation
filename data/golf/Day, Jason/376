Q.   What a beautiful ball‑striking day for you, 16 greens including that one at the 17th, tell me about the deuce you dropped?
JASON DAY:   Yeah, just turned a little too much in the wind, was on the second half of the green and up and over.   It was kind of like going into a putt‑putt course and putt them over, actually sat on a good line, went down and rolled in the cup nicely.   Unfortunately didn't get the birdie on the last hole but overall very, very happy with how I've played.

Q.   You've played well here in the past?
JASON DAY:   Yeah, I finished sixth here the first year I played and hopefully I can keep playing well for tomorrow. 

Q.   How was it playing with Coach Harbaugh? 
JASON DAY:   It was great.   He's a really, really good guy.   Obviously watching him on TV, you think he's really intense.   Really fun‑loving guy.   We've had a lot of fun the last three days, and we goat to play another day tomorrow, which is great, and I'm looking forward to it.
