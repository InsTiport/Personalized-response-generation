 Q. Remarkable golf, Jason. 
 JASON DAY: Thanks.

 Q. If you could just talk about or put this tournament in perspective. 
 JASON DAY: Obviously it's my first U.S. Open. Very excited that I finished second. I'm not going to go home and cry because I got whooped. 
 But Rory, you can't beat a guy that's gone out and played as well as he has this week. He just didn't miss a beat, played phenomenal golf, and I played really, really solid golf over the weekend, which I really wanted to do, and I'm very, very happy to finish second, which is nice.

 Q. Robert Garrigus was in here and saying that you can bet your boots that Olympic isn't going to be set up like this. The USGA may put a smiling face on, but perhaps this is not what they expected out of this golf course. 
 JASON DAY: Well, the weather, you know, obviously didn't help with how soft the greens and the fairways were. But besides Rory, I finished 8-under, and the rest, obviously it was a little easier U.S. Open than in the past. But they're going to set it up tough. 
 But I think the USGA did a really well-done job out there. The crowds were in it, and I think everyone just had a really good time. Obviously I was playing in the group in front of Rory, and you just hear so many fans just yelling out his name. I think that's good for the game, that obviously there's a lot of birdies flying out there, which is nice.

 Q. A lot of 20-somethings are out there right now making headlines in this sport, winning major championships. If you could talk a little bit about as far as you're concerned the dawn of a new generation of players from many continents that are able to come out and vie for major championships?
 JASON DAY: Yeah, obviously if you go around to each country, each country has their own rising star coming up. This is the start of it, and obviously Rory is leading it, and there's a bunch of other great golfers out there that obviously we need to work a little harder to get to the level of Rory. But you're right, we really are going to start a new generation, and it's really fun. I think it's great for golf. 

 Q. Before the tournament if someone with a crystal ball had said to you you're going to shoot 8-under par at the U.S. Open but that you'd lose by eight strokes, what would you have said to that crystal ball wielder?
 JASON DAY: I would have said you're nuts. Definitely I would have said you're nuts. Obviously coming to a U.S. Open that I've never played before, I was thinking that 4-under was going to win it, and what is it, 16- or 17-under? 16 ended up winning it? It's just phenomenal golf. He lapped the field, and for such a young age, how mature he is. Golf right now is in a really, really good spot where Rory McIlroy is right now.

 Q. If somebody such as Rory with the personality that he has, let's say he does become the next sort of dominant golfer, considering him and what you know about him, is he a great ambassador for the sport?
 JASON DAY: Definitely. Definitely. With all that's gone on over his career, he's had so much success in a short period of time, he's very, very level-headed. I think that's the team that he has around him is keeping him very level-headed. He's a very humble kid. He is a very -- if we wanted an ambassador for golf for the next generation, he'd be one of the guys, definitely.
