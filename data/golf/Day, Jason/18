  Q. Just a few comments on the final round.
 JASON DAY:   It was good.  I played solid for the most part all week.  Today was a good stepping-stone into next week.  I know that we're going to have a bit of a different course next week in regards to how hard the course will probably be, if the weather commits, obviously.
 But I'm excited about the game because I had -- I finished 11-under, 5-under today, 11-under total, and hit seven balls in the water.  I had two or three three-putts out there.  You take those mistakes out, and you're probably right up near the lead somewhere.
 Q. Talk about the golf course; throughout the course of the week did you see it getting closer to what you expect next week?
 JASON DAY:   Today it was, yeah.  Obviously the length wasn't quite there in regards to some of the holes, like 14 was up, some of the other holes were up a little bit.  But for the most part the greens started getting a little bit firmer and they started getting a little bit faster.  They felt a foot or two feet maybe faster than the last couple days, and obviously that's due to the fact that we had a lot of wind the last two days.
 It's nice to be able to play today to try and get a feel for how it's going to be next Thursday.
 Q. If you could just take this week out of it, I know it's a home game, this would be your preference, but if there was any TOUR course you could play in back-to-back weeks, what would it be?
 JASON DAY:   In back-to-back weeks?
 Q. And take this one out --
 JASON DAY:   It would probably have to be somewhere like Pebble, I think, because I play good there and it's actually quite beautiful there, so it would probably have to be Pebble week, even though sometimes the weather can be a little bit iffy.  So yeah, that would be it.
 Q. You had said earlier in the week that you were working on your attitude, staying positive.  How did you progress with that this week?
 JASON DAY:   It was a lot better, yeah.  But sometimes you just -- it's funny, when you're going through a bit of a rough patch, you start to blame other things other than yourself, and sometimes you've just got to have a hard look at yourself and understand the attitude isn't helping the game out at all, so you may as well just try and fix that, and that's obviously the first thing that you try and do.  The attitude was a lot better.
 I felt like I was just trying to play the victim role a little bit too much especially because I haven't played that great coming back after the break and then a bunch of missed cuts, and my body is sore.  I just don't want to play that role.  I want to take it for what it is and just get on with it.
 Q. How much of a turning point do you think today and this week could be?
 JASON DAY:   Yeah, I'm actually -- I'm the most excited I have been in a long time with my putting.  Usually I've been -- I'm in the top 10 putting every year, and this year I've been 171st, so when you're -- when there's that big of a margin between where you usually are, there's a lot of opportunities that are missed, and today was a nice indication of where my putting is actually starting to progress into.  I've been working very, very hard.  I've been trying to bust my butt really over kind of the last two months to try and get ready for this.  I feel things looking forward.
 Q. Where did you spend most of the break?
 JASON DAY:   I've been here in Westerville, so I've just been home.  We didn't leave for the first, gosh, two months.  We didn't really leave the house at all.  Well, I know I didn't leave the house for the first month and a half.  It was nice to be able to have the facility at the house where I could get out, even though when I first came back there was still snow on the ground so it was a little bit cold, but now we're into some nice warm weather.
 Q. How much were you able to play this course --
 JASON DAY:   I played nine holes before Tuesday's practice round.
 Q. That's it?
 JASON DAY:   Yeah, that's it.
 Q. A little off topic, the fact that you guys did have that long break, obviously fewer tournaments, does that put more pressure on you?  Do you have to fight that urge and say, we only have X number instead of the normal allotment?
 JASON DAY:   I think it's the opposite actually.  That's why you see a lot of names that usually probably aren't there that are up there playing well.  They have a free year in regards to they don't have to worry about keeping their card because they've got a card through to the end of next season.  There's no fans out here.  I think the fans add a lot more pressure to the actual event.  So I'm missing the fans.  There's guys out here that are just kind of free-wheeling it because of those two factors.
 I think it's a good indication on how the scores have been because you look at the last few tournaments and they've been 4-under, 4-under and 5-under on the cut line.  A lot of good golf is being played.  Well, unless we're just seeing a new breed of golfers that have come off quarantine and are playing really good.  But I think that's the case.
 Q. Thinking about the leaderboard, it's all young guys.  Do you feel like an old guy out here sometimes?
 JASON DAY:   Yeah, I do.  I used to be the young guy.  Yeah, I'm 33.  I was just explaining to BG out there that this is my 13th season on the TOUR and I feel like I've been here for a while.  But there's a lot of familiar faces still and then there's a lot of new faces that I don't know and I haven't met before, so it's surprising to see the number of faces that are out here, especially young guys.
