Q. Jason Day answering a lot of questions about his health, considering last time we saw you in competition you walked off the golf course.  How impressive was that number today for you?
JASON DAY: Like I said, every now and then, it hurt on the drive.  Mostly on the drive this morning, obviously, because you're trying to go a little bit harder.  I'm grateful, obviously, to be one back currently after the first day is nice.  Yeah, some of the drives out there today hurt, just at the top of the transition.  Once you go forward with the hips and crunches down, and it just hurts a bit.  I feel like everything's coming around the corner.
It would have been a perfect world for me to have two weeks off, just to really kind of rest and get into it.  But like I said a minute ago, these guys aren't going to be sympathetic to me now.  So I've got to suck it up and play the best golf we can because after this week, I can rest as much as I can.
Q. How much does this trophy mean to you?
JASON DAY: It's huge, really big to me, not only to win the FedExCup, but hopefully, if I do win the tournament, that will possibly bring home player of the year as well.  I can't get too far ahead of myself.  If I start thinking about that stuff, I get sidetracked and start making mental errors, and it costs me the lead, and I'm back to what I did last year and finish second to Jordan.
I'd like to give Dustin a good run for it.  To be honest, to be able to put my name on the FEDEX trophy is one of my goals in my golf career.  This is starting to become a very big thing for all of us to be able to become a FEDEX champion is huge.
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, what do you think you need to improve on?
JASON DAY: Not too much.  Obviously, just kind of get a massage tonight and really try to work out the inflammation in my back, and then, you know, hit a few fairways.  I think that's pretty good.  I feel like I'm striking it pretty well.  I'm pretty pleased with how everything is progressing.  I've got to just slowly chip away at it and be patient with myself.  This week is all about patience.
Obviously, the scores hopefully won't run away too far.  But once again, I've got to keep pushing forward and see where I am by Sunday.
