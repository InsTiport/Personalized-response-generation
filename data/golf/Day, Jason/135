Q. You really had it going there early, obviously gave a few back but you're still in contention.
JASON DAY: It was good.  I had it going great and I felt -- what's the course record, and obviously it can turn pretty quick, especially if you're out of position.  The one on 8, definitely a poor shot.
The tee shot on 9 was poor.
And then you miss a few anywhere on 10, I think the only good place to miss it is the bunker.  If you miss in the rough, there's no way of holding that green, and then you're trying to save yourself.
Yeah, I mean, it was a little difficult out there but I felt like I ground it out pretty good.  I know Patrick is up there, and I'm currently four back.  Just got to try to get it under par and slowly chip away at it.
Q. It's turning into like that U.S. Open-feel, isn't it, and that's where you generally excel.
JASON DAY: Yeah, just go grind it out.  There was a couple times today where it was hot and sticky and you're just grinding it out.  You're just like, I don't know if I can grind it out anymore.  If you get past today, you'll come out tomorrow, hopefully everything will be better.  Get some good rest tonight and get into it tomorrow.
I'm really looking forward to the weekend.  I feel like I'm really close.  I mean, the driving hasn't been spot on but I know the reps that I've done prior to this hopefully will catch up to my game and I'll start driving it a little bit better.
The touch feels pretty good.  I feel like I'm rolling the ball pretty well.  I've just got to give myself the opportunities.  Once again, if you don't get yourself in the fairways, you're not going to give yourself the opportunities.
Q. Will you change your approach on the weekend as far as being aggressive with the driver off the tee or stick with it?
JASON DAY: Well, sometimes you can't not -- you have to hit driver.  You're looking at 9 and 10; 11, you can ease off a little, but 12, they are holes that you have to hit driver.
If you're hitting 3-wood, 2-iron, you probably won't even make the fairway on 10, and you're leaving yourself so far in with firm greens that are going to be bouncy.  It's just a disadvantage to not hit driver on some holes.
But I don't think it will change too much.  I feel like I've just got to get out there and just I think get a little bit more sharp with the mental side of things and hopefully from there, give myself a chance on Sunday.
Q. What are your thoughts on 18, the way you played it coming in, as far as off the tee?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I hit 3-iron yesterday.  I hit 4-iron today.  Some guys, Adam and Dustin hit driver.  Dustin unfortunately made bogey.  That's the thing, you can get some sticky lies out here; the rough is so thick.  You get it on the fairway, gave myself a good opportunity.  Hit it to 11 feet and unfortunately just missed the putt.  You've got to go with what you feel like you can get off the fairway, and unfortunately that was a 4-iron for me today.
Q. How much had you heard about this place before and has it lived up to it?
JASON DAY: Well, I played back in I think 2012.  It's just a brutal course.  I was talking to Scotty actually back when he played the U.S. Open I think 2001 or 2002.  He was talking about the fifth hole.  And he goes, there was probably only two guys in the field that could actually cut the bunker on the right.  Now most of the field can do that.
So just goes to show what technology has done for us.  But also, with that said, I mean, you look at the scores, it's only going to get tougher on the weekend.  Everything is going to get a lot more condensed.  I don't really see it going too much lower than what it is.  I still think single digits is a pretty good score.  But we'll see how it goes.
