 Q.  This course can really get you if you're not careful, right?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I think you have to be very precise with the second shots.  Once you get yourself in the fairway with the southwest wind that stretch is very, very difficult.   
 Q.  This is your 9th start here.  You are a member here at Muirfield Village.  The best finish you've ever had, though.  How happy are you with your game as you head into the second major of the year?  
JASON DAY: I made it on the cut.  And whatever I'm at right now, I'm very pleased with it.   
 Q.  Your coach and caddie said you are very close to winning and very soon.  Well done this week and we look forward to seeing you the rest of the season.
