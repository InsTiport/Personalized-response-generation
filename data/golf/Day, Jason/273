  JASON DAYQ. Can I get a couple comments just on the way down?  How was your round today?JASON DAY: Not bad considering I -- I had a lot of in between clubs and started feeling a lot better after the 12th hole.  That was a plus.  I think I hit 13 greens and just didn't capitalize at all on the stuff that I had.  It's unfortunate because I felt like I gave myself enough opportunities. Couple of putts, 11 and 12, go in and it's a different story, I feel different and opportunities come down the line.  If you don't hole those, it doesn't go your way.Q. How do you feel today sickness wise?JASON DAY: After 12 I felt much better.  I'm just glad that I got it in on the weekend.
