 Q. You're 1 off the lead? 
 JASON DAY: I've played great the last two days, few mistakes the last couple of days and just going to go out there and do exactly what I've done the last couple of days. Just try to hit a lot of fairways, hit some greens, a lot of opportunities for birdies, and if I do make mistakes, hopefully it's in the right spot. 

 Q. That kinda works everywhere, doesn't it? 
 JASON DAY: It does. 

 Q. I heard you were sick; you almost pulled out of the tournament? 
 JASON DAY: Yeah, started with a cold and then turned into bronchitis, and then the swine flu after that, and now I have a sinus infection. I'm actually on meds, and they're pretty heavy duty stuff, and they do make me a little sick at times, but everything is starting to come back. 

 Q. Finally got a diagnoses, and they're treating it, and you come out and shoot 9-under. 
 JASON DAY: Hopefully I can keep that play going on through the weekend. 

 Q. What do you have to do this weekend? You haven't been in the hunt this year; it's got to be exciting to be right there. 
 JASON DAY: Yeah, it's exciting. I haven't played as well as I would have liked to this year, and my main goal tomorrow is to stay patient and just try and get myself into some good opportunities. 

 Q. Seems like a day of patience out there. 
 JASON DAY: It was a pretty long day, actually. We weren't catching the guys ahead of us, some holes we caught them but the guys behind us weren't catching us either, so it was a very long day, especially with the heat. I don't know how hot it got, but it felt hot out there, so I stayed patient out there. I'm very happy about that, gave myself some opportunities and holed a lot of good putts and saved par to keep the momentum going in my direction. 

 Q. You're in a great position for the weekend. 
 JASON DAY: Yeah, I'm 1 shot back, and I'm not too sure how far the lead will go over the next two days, just depending on how they set up the course. But like I said, the goal tomorrow and the next day is to stay patient and try and give myself a chance to make the birdies. 

 Q. You haven't been in this position for a while so are you nervous out there today? 
 JASON DAY: No, not really, I think the more you try and focus on the shot, the more you try and focus on what you need to do, you know, that takes everything away. 
 I'm sure I'm going to be nervous over the weekend, I'm sure, if I'm in the hunt. But I'm just going to try to play my game. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JASON DAY: Yeah I hit driver bunker in the left rough and then had 183 -- 193 --

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JASON DAY: Yeah, 193 yards to the front and I hit -- I knew I had a flyer out of there, and I hit the 7-iron out of there, and I got lucky, kicked up and around to the left and had a 20-foot putt and drained that, which was nice. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JASON DAY: No, not really. I didn't want to move -- I looked at the scoreboard and I thought 6-under is a top-10 right now; I'm just going to try to shoot for that, if anything. 
 If I get anything better than that, that's great but I was just trying to stay as patient as I could out there and not try and make stupid hits and take myself out of the tournament so I had to play my way back in.
