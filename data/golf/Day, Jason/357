Q.  Your assessment on your play today?  Rough start and finish --
JASON DAY:  I think I played well.  Like you said, I just
had a difficult start and finish.  That's just golf.  And it's
going to happen.  Especially in links golf when there's a bit of
luck with bounces and whatnot out here.  Once you're trying to
land it 25, 35, 45 yards short of the hole or the green, and
you're trying to run them up, sometimes you get a little bit
unlucky and leave yourself in bad positions.
But I'm looking forward to the next three days.
Q.  There's a lot of talk with the weather back in '02.
Today quite opposite of that?
JASON DAY:  Yeah.  I think the easterly wind is going to
come in the next few days and kind of cool it down a little bit.
But by the looks of it, it looks pretty nice.  And the last two
Opens that I played we had some bad weather.  Royal St. Georges
and St. Andrews, wind delay, and then we had a lot of rain at
Royal St. Georges.  So just excited to play links golf in the sun.
Q.  How is the course playing?
JASON DAY:  Yeah, I think the bounce is very critical.
Lag putting is very critical, as well.  Because it's very tough to
get any kind of shots near the holes.  There are some accessible
pins out there, but it's really tricky, because you just have to
carry some slopes.  If you're short, then they're going to roll
back down; if you're long, they're going to bounce through.  So
it's very crucial to get the right bounces out here.
Q.  A double on the last, what mindset -- will you go out on
the range?
JASON DAY:  No, my wrist is cactus right now.  So I'm not
going to do any practice.  I'm going to try and rest up as much as
possible and get into it tomorrow, and slowly chip away at it and
hopefully with this easterly wind it makes it a little tougher for
everyone, and hopefully it brings back the field a little bit.
But we've got so many good players in the field, it's going to be
tough to get back.  But just really get some good rest tonight and
get into it tomorrow.



I putted a few from 30 feet, 15 foot past.
So --
Q.  (Inaudible.) Are you taking --
JASON DAY:  I'm taking nothing out of that, it was just a
lot of rubbish.  Yeah, I just felt like I was going to hit it left
all day and I was fighting that.  And it was just a struggle.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY:  Me, I'm not going to do a lot now, to be
honest.  I think my rest has run.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY:  Yeah, well, I've had my morning round, which
is going to be the easier round, because it's drying out this
afternoon.  Yeah, it's unfortunate, but it's golf.
Q.  Your match tomorrow?
JASON DAY:  Yeah, I'll be going for everything tomorrow.
8-under somewhere, but --
Q.  (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY:  Thanks, okay.
