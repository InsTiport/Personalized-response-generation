JASON DAY: I was trying to just land a little bit short and let it go down the hill.  Either way, if I went straight at it or I did that, I would have hit it 12 foot past.  I may to try and make it more exciting.
I'm very pleased to get past Rory, it was a very, very tough match today.
Q. You were standing over that putt, how would you measure your confidence level when you are standing over big putts?
JASON DAY: I was nervous.  I was really, really nervous.  It was great to feel those things.  I'm going to take that experience that I had today against Rory into the future and into the tournaments that we play against each other.  But it was a hard match today to try and beat him.  I'm looking forward to the final.
It's great to be able to have a shot at winning this tournament.  I would have been a little bit disappointed going through all the stuff and not having a chance of winning.
