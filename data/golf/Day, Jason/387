 Q. Obviously a tough day, but just talk about the experience overall for the week, what's it been like for you, being a local? 
 JASON DAY: It's a dish experience. The American guys are tough opponents. They do it every single year. For me this is my first experience and I know now certain things that I won't do in another couple years. 
 It's been a hard work. It's good for a change, not just to think about yourself but think about others. And as long as I gave it 100 percent, I was happy with that. Obviously it was a tough day for me out there, bogeyed the first six holes or something. 
 Yeah, I'm just looking forward to it. Obviously it's fun when things come down to -- it's getting close. There's a lot of work for us to do, and we just need to keep our heads down and keep moving forward. 

 Q. When you went to the first tee this morning, was there any noticeable difference with it being a team event than like you would for a regular tournament?
 JASON DAY: There is a lot of pressure to try and perform for your team because you don't want to let them down. 
 You know, today I just got out of the blocks, I just putted very poorly. Hunter just played great golf today.
