 Q.  Tough round the front nine, but you really fought your way back, four birdies in the last six holes?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, well, I mean, it was kind of a tough one for me out there.  Obviously, like you said, it got off to a bad start.  It was just a mistake after mistake on the front side for me and unfortunately, that's sometimes how it goes.  To be honest, I just kept on making silly errors and mistakes out there and unfortunately, I got behind the eight ball.   
But, you know what, I think with how I played on the back side, I feel good about going into tomorrow and trying to build momentum for next week's tournament.  But if I can go out there and shoot a low one tomorrow, that will do wonders for the confidence.  And just always got to stay positive with the process that I'm trying to get back to winning form and we'll see how it goes.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow, going to have some nice weather and it should be good.
