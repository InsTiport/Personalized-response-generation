  Q. Good way to start the playoffs and the tournament?  
 JASON DAY: No, it was a good day. Bogey-free which was nice. It's good to get off to a good start obviously in the first tournament.  
 So hopefully I can keep moving forward it would be nice.  
  
  Q. How has your health been? Have you been fighting a few sinus deals?  
 JASON DAY: I've been fighting it all year but over the past two weeks -- sorry, the last week coming into this week -- I've been feeling pretty good. Feels like I'm 100 percent but I'm not going to try and overdo it.  
  
  Q. How is the course playing? I know the conditions this morning are probably pretty good with it being wet?  
 JASON DAY: Obviously we got -- I prefer -- we got to mark it and clean it and place it, which was nice. But as long as you hit the fairway you could set yourself up for some good opportunities.
