Q. How would you rate the performance as the week went along?
JASON DAY: Yeah, it's kind of funny that I'm walking off a little bit disappointed about the round today.  The last four holes kind of just played even par was a little disappointing with two par-5s.
But kind of started the same way last year.  Hoping to kind of sneak a top-10 here, but probably doesn't look like it.  But I think overall it's pretty solid start to having three months off.  To get out here and shoot 15-under was pretty nice.  I'm not too disappointed about it.  I'm looking forward to getting back at it at Torrey.
Q. With that layoff what do you take from here?  Your schedule now start getting a little more consistent playing competitively?
JASON DAY: Yeah, just trying to get back into the swing of things with being sharp.  And I'm talking about just not missing greens with wedges and not 3-putting from 20, 30 feet, just little things like that.
Having soft bogeys, that's kind of the stuff that holds you back.  So I made a lot of silly errors out there and I gave away a lot of easy birdies out there this week.  So try and tidy that up for the upcoming tournaments.
But my next stop is Torrey which is a very difficult golf course.  Obviously the South Course is tough, but North Course you can kind of take advantage of.  So I got to get back to the drawing board, kind of get back on to what needs to happen for me to win that tournament.
