Q. Couple of comments so you can go.  Go ahead and tell us about your day and how you feel.JASON DAY: I didn't feel that great coming out early, and then felt like -- I felt pretty groggy on the front nine just from the drugs that I had in my system, then kind of flushed that out on the back nine. But then it kind of came back -- the vertigo came back a little bit on the 13th tee box, and then felt nauseous all day.  I started shaking on 16 tee box and then just tried to get it in, really.  Just wanted to get it in.Q. Amazing round of golf you just played.  Can you even -- I would imagine that you thought you might not have gotten through?JASON DAY: Last year I didn't play the round after I had vertigo and this one was worse.  I think the goal was just to go through today and see how it goes.
