Q. Talk about that last hole.
JASON DAY: I hooked my 2-iron to the bunker, and then I had to lay up and just didn't really hit a good third shot.  So I actually drove it pretty good today with my driver.  Every time I hit an iron I kept on missing everything left.  So that's usually not the miss I've been having lately, so it kind of caught me off guard.  It was kind of hard to trust the swing from there.  But, you know, it's 2-over par on a pretty easy day out there.
But the next three days are going to be pretty difficult.  So got a lot of work to do.  But hopefully by the end of the day I'm not too far behind.  I can just slowly inch my way back into the tournament.
Q. So it's a long day, were you shooting them (inaudible).
JASON DAY: I was missing it both ways I'm pretty certain.  Yeah, it's more so the irons that I've been struggling with.  Obviously when you're confident with your swing, you can get up there and hit different shots.  Right now I'm trying to hit a certain shot and it's coming out the opposite.  So there is obviously a little bit of a -- more of a mental issue there with not trusting the swing as much.  I think if I can work that out -- I mean, I don't think it's anything other than just got to get out there and just try to hit the shots, and hopefully it comes together over the next few days.
Q. The weather is set to change tomorrow.  How tough will it be to bring it back?
JASON DAY: It depends.  I'm already missing greens anyways.  So I've been trying to save myself.  And if I'm going to miss greens, I'm going to miss greens on hard days, and if I can just grind myself out and make pars, it would be great.  If I can hit a little bit better tomorrow, that would be fantastic.  Hit a few more greens, hole a few more putts.  I think I only made two birdies today, so that's pretty low on a day like this where we have no wind and the course is very gettable.
So I think if I'm patient and I just start hitting the correct shots and give myself the opportunities, I can get myself back in the tournament.
Q. What happened on 8 and what were your options for your second shot?
JASON DAY: 8, Danny Willett hit 9-iron just short of the pin there.  And I had wedge in my hand and I hit it and kind of turned it over just a little bit, and it kind of surprised me it went that far.  It just went a long way.  Obviously I'm not trying to go on the top of the hill there.  It's a tough hole anyways if you miss the green, and I wanted to miss it in between the two bunkers on the left side.  Once I did that it was a pretty simple up-and-down, as long as I could get there.
Q. Do the benign conditions make it more frustrating that there was time to score out there?
JASON DAY: It is, but you still can't understatement links golf and the bounces that you get out here.  You've still got to hit good shots and play well.  Obviously, it is a little frustrating, but I think if I can just understand that the next few days are going to be very difficult, the scores are probably going to start coming back.  If I can just play good, solid golf and get the ball in front of me, I think I can inch my way back in.
