  JASON DAY: I gave myself chances out there.  A couple of holes I wish I would have liked some shots back, but that's just part and parcel of playing.  Could have had some shots back early in my tournament, as well, but you know, I read the putt on 18, just to do what I expected it to do.  I hit a good putt.  All I wanted to do was put a good stroke on it.  I didn't want to blast it way past the hole and hit it through the break, so I just wanted to hit my normal putt and try and hole it.  Unfortunately I thought it was a little bit faster, and it just pulled up short.Q. (Inaudible.)JASON DAY: Yeah, I've been working very hard to try and accomplish my first major, and you know, it's a little frustrating with how it finished.  But I've been in contention at major championships a lot now, and it just shows I'm doing the right things, and I can't look at it as a negative.  I'm just a little frustrated because I just walked off the course about five minutes ago.  Give it time so I can just sit down and look at what the positives were and move on from there and just try and get better.Q. One of those positives was you got rid of your big mistakes.JASON DAY: Yeah, I went bogey-free again today.  I think I only had three bogeys for the week.  Today was playing very difficult coming home, and it was tough to get it close to the pins.  You know, I just -- the biggest thing for me was just trying to stay as patient as possible and hopefully give myself an opportunity coming down the back side, but it is what it is.Q. You talked last night about walking up the 18th with maybe a chance to have a putt to win The Open.  The fact that didn't happen, it's nothing to beat yourself up about, is it?JASON DAY: No, I did the right things.  I really did the right things to give myself the opportunity at getting into the playoff and having a shot at winning my first major, but I played really good golf this week, and I can't be disappointed by it.  It was just tough to get the ball close to the pins today.  I don't know, it's just something that I really want to do is I really want to have that shot at immortality.  It'll soon come my way.  I've just got to be patient with it.
