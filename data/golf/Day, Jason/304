 Q.  7-under 65 in round two.  You have to be pretty pleased with that.  JASON DAY: Yeah, I had to come back and play the 18th hole on the South Course this morning and I gave myself a good opportunity at making birdie and I ended up with par.  So that was a little frustrating with the position that I was.  Shooting 1-over on that side. Then, obviously, coming over to the North side, which is the easier side, and shooting 7-under, which was great.  Definitely it helps.  That's the side that you need to capitalize on and really kind of shoot yourself up the leaderboard, because the South is very, very difficult.   Q.  Everybody said these are the perfect conditions to be playing in today.  Would you have rather had these conditions yesterday?  JASON DAY: You know what, I was talking to Dustin and Justin out there, kind of thinking what would have been harder, today playing, obviously, the South Course or it would have been easier playing the South Course, maybe.  It just is what it is. Unfortunately, we had some bad weather yesterday, but I'm just glad I turned it around and shot 7-under today.   Q.  Do you think that 7-under is going to catapult you into the weekend?  JASON DAY: Well, I think I'm tied for 7th right now, so.   Q.  But I mean as far as playability and the way you're playing.  JASON DAY: It's tough because obviously there's a lot more opportunities on the North Course and you start missing some fairways on the South Course and leaving yourself 30 to 40 foot putts, it's tough to get any kind of momentum rolling your way. Obviously, over the weekend it tightens up a little bit, but it's going to be a tough weekend, we're going to have some good weather so the golf should be exciting.
