START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT








Q. A little bit of a roll last night, you I know you probably wanted to keep going.  But a pretty good start this morning, too, it was cold?
JASON DAY: No, it was good.  Obviously, starting off the day wasn't the greatest start, but coming back with two birdies after that was nice.  And then it was cold, it was hard to feel your hands and didn't quite get the ball on the club face the way I wanted to.  But with the weather getting a little warmer it should be a little bit easier.
Q. A 4 a.m. wake up, a little early, wasn't it?
JASON DAY: 4:30.  But you know what I'm glad I got out here, just to see how the conditions are.  Obviously, we're going to go to Pebble this afternoon, but it's nice though with sunshine and looking forward to the next two days.
Q. Boldest move of the day has got to be the white pants, man, it's a little muddy out there.
JASON DAY: Well, I thought that it's going to be nice weather, I may as well get the white pants.  We get 'em for free anyway, it's all good, mate.
