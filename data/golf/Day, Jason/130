 Q.  We haven't seen you compete on the PGA TOUR since September.  Were there some emotions on the first tee?  
JASON DAY: No, no, it was all right.  It's good to be here.  Obviously the way everything finished last year was a little bit disappointing.   
I understand that I need to make sure that I need to take care of myself.  Obviously out here longevity is obviously key with career, and I had to do the right thing and take some time off.   
But standing on the tee, I was a little nervous.  I haven't stood on a tee for three months.  It's a long time.   
 Q.  How would you assess your play today?  
JASON DAY: It was actually all right.  Just didn't putt that great.  I mean, I had two 3-putts, and that was pretty much it.  I had one poor -- 11 was a poor shot into the green and obviously didn't get up-and-down.   
It was pretty solid.  I think I hit a lot of fairways.  Hit a lot of greens.  I'd like to obviously tighten it up over the next few days with regards to proximity, but after having three months, I think 3-under is pretty good.
