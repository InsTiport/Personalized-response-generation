Q. Talk us through your round a bit.
JASON DAY:   I need to hit it a little bit straighter with the driver to give myself a few more opportunities.  I felt like overall I played some solid golf, made a poor double bogey on 3, just kind of had nowhere -- kind of hit a poor shot out to the right and then made a mess of it.
I think overall it was just a little bit indifferent.  I'm not angry, I'm not mad about it either or happy about it, so overall we've still got three days left, so we've got to just focus on that.
Q. Quite a few red numbers.  Does that surprise you?
JASON DAY:   Not really, not with the conditions we have right now.  Yeah, it's interesting, obviously the good players are playing really well right now, and that's why they're at the top of the leaderboard, especially with Thomas and Reed.  They're playing some good golf.
I've just got to focus on my game because I think with the weather we've got coming in, I definitely think over par is still going to win this.  I've just got to focus on that.
Q. Can you walk us through the 3rd hole?
JASON DAY:   4-iron, just kind of half scrapped it out to the right, was in the rough on kind of the downslope of the bunker, but it was just outside, and then kind of just went straight underneath it, left myself in the rough again over the bunker.  It was a tough lie, going back into the grain, going back towards you, and I hit it, and it came out left, went down the hill, nearly holed the fourth shot, but that's the way it is.
Q. What's the game plan for tomorrow?
JASON DAY:   I'll see how the guys go in the morning.  Obviously I think ball is not going to go as far, wind is going to be up, conditions are going to be tougher.  It's just try and stay as patient as possible really.
