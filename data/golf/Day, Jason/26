 Q.  Jason, just some thoughts on the week overall.  
JASON DAY: Good.  Had a lot of fun.  The fans were fantastic here.  Travelers does a phenomenal job with this tournament.  Glad we had some nice sun on the weekend.  Seemed like it was going to be a very tight finish for the crowd, but obviously unfortunately Keegan (indiscernible) on 17 and Chez birdieing 17.  So walking down the last hole with a 4-shot lead.   
But I think overall everything is in a positive spot right now.   
 Q.  Next few weeks going forward, what's the plan?  
JASON DAY: Just get back and practice.  I need to improve the putting.  Even though I hit a lot of good, quality putts, just not quite happy with it.   
I hit 88% of greens this week.   
 Q.  Pretty strong.  
JASON DAY: Which is very strong.  Shot 1-under today and hit 17 greens.  The only mistake I made was on the par-3 and I miss hit it and pulled up short in the water.   
There are a lot of positives coming from this week and I feel really good about my game.  Very, very motivated to go back and practice this coming week and get ready for the 3M.   
 Q.  Talk about this.  
JASON DAY: Yeah, the clubhouse last year was a little bit smaller than what it is right now.  This is a fantastic addition that they've made this year.  Just seems like the tournament is getting better and better each and every year.  We had a great field this year.  The fans are out here again, and obviously brand new clubhouse is spectacular.   
 Q.  Will you be back again?  
JASON DAY: I don't know.  We'll see.  That's a long ways away.   
 Q.  A year is a long way?  
JASON DAY: I enjoy coming back here every time I play.
