  Q. How tough was it out there?
 JASON DAY:   Yeah, it was obviously difficult.  I mean, I felt like we had three pretty difficult days.  Obviously Thursday was a lot tamer.  But the scoring opportunities on Thursday -- there was a lot more opportunities, I should say.
 Today the guys are going to have an enjoyable one out there today (laughing).  It's really firm, and the greens are quick, and they've got some bounce to them, too, which is nice.  The wind is kind of switching around a little bit out there today, so it's gone from like a northerly to an easterly and it's going back and forth, so it's really difficult to kind of judge what the ball is going to do in the air.  You've got to stay committed.
 Q. What's the toughest stretch?
 JASON DAY:   Walking to the first tee.  You have to play the 18 holes.
 I would say you've got to get through the first kind of five holes.  If you get through those first five holes even par that will at least set you up to get something on like maybe 6 and 9 for birdie, and then you go through kind of 10, 11 and 12, and then starting kind of 14 on, if you can get through that stretch even par, then you're --
 Q. I walked with you at Whistling Straits and the atmosphere out there was just electric.  How different will it be without fans for Matt and Bryson in that final group?
 JASON DAY:   It won't be too different for Matt because he hasn't had much experience in major championships, and I'm not saying that as in -- because he's more of a rookie, and that's more understandable.  I think he's only played maybe one year or so and then we went straight into quarantine and now we're getting used to not having fans, whereas Bryson has played a little bit in front of fans.  But if there's ever a major championship where you want something to be quiet, it's here in New York, because as you know, the fans can be pretty loud.  Whether that's a positive or a negative, how you look at it is totally up to you.  It's interesting, it's very, very quiet for a New York tournament.
