 Q.  Good solid round for a shot at this title on Sunday.  Talking putting, straight into it, 25 today.  How much did that keep you in the tournament?  
JASON DAY: Well, you know what, strangely enough, obviously I hit it off the map today.  But to be honest, I felt like I actually played okay with everything else other than the driver.   
The putter did save me a lot of strokes.  Could have well been in the 80s today if I didn't have anything going.   
 Q.  20-some yesterday and 25 today; how does this feel right now?  
JASON DAY: I'm just trying to find myself -- I'm trying to get myself on the putting green, that's all I'm asking, get myself an opportunity.  I gave myself a chance for birdie and I feel like I've got a chance at holing those putts.  Fortunately it went in.   
 Q.  You touched on it yesterday, you don't feel good with the driver right now.  Something you want to sharpen up for tomorrow --  
JASON DAY: You know, what to be honest, it's obviously going both ways.  It's more going left than right.  When I stand over it, I have no clue where it's going.   
But the hardest thing is to actually -- when you're struggling to commit to a line or to commit to a shot, that's when you have a two-way miss, and unfortunately I just wasn't able to commit because of not knowing where it was going, and try to did the best job I could.   
I think if I can get it on the golf course somewhere tomorrow, might have a chance to win this tomorrow.
