 Q. A bit of a tough week, but nice way to finish at Augusta?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, a couple of birdies was good. Yeah, obviously kind of a touch and go week for me this week. I'm looking forward to coming back next year. It's always a pleasure to come here. It was a fun week.   
I'm really looking forward to seeing how it unfolds this afternoon with guys and seeing how they play, because it's definitely there on the backside. I think they can shoot a low one on the backside. With that said, no lead is obviously ever guaranteed around a joint like this. I'm happy.   
   
 Q. Who's your pick?  
JASON DAY: I picked Fowler at the start of the day. But Sergio is looking pretty good right now. I have to stay with my horse. He's my teammate at the Desert Classic in a couple of weeks, so I'm going with Fowler.   
   
 Q. What was the toughest thing for you this afternoon?  
JASON DAY: I think obviously I was coming in and the greens started getting really firm, really fast. So just from the front side to the back side the greens obviously changed a lot. And being able to gauge how much it's going to bounce and being receptive on the greens and seeing how much change of pace there is from front to back, obviously due to the sun and wind we had a little bit. The hardest thing is obviously to get yourself in position. The next step is just capitalizing on those opportunities. But it's an exciting day, I can tell you that much.
