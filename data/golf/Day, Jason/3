Q. First of all, happy birthday.
JASON DAY: Thanks. 

Q. Look, I know you probably feel like you could have done better, but you did rescue a round there today. 
JASON DAY: Yeah, I got off to a tough startââ it wasn't really tough. I threeâputted 5 and then made a very easy bogey on 7, just kind of missed the fairway there. From there on, I kind ofââ I don't know how to explain it. I scored well, but I didn't score well in the same sentence. There's a lot of putts that could have gone my way that unfortunately just missed, but happy to get out of it at 2 under.

Q. Do you feel like you get sort of jazzed up when you make five in seven holes, and then you come to 15 thinking three? 
JASON DAY: Yeah, unfortunately, that was just a mental error. I had 218 to the pin, and my 4 iron goes 228 at 80 degrees. It just felt like it cooled down a little bit. The wind was kind of back into the face just ever so slightly. It wasn't much, but it was enough to like make you feel just a little bit off. It's 250 yards to the back of the green. I should have hit 3 iron instead of 4. 
Unfortunately, took that gamble. Sometimes it just doesn't work out. I should have learned that from, I think, last year or the year before that, especially with the soft conditions. Just knock it off the back and you chip down the green. 
It's not that intimidating right now because of how slow the greens were playing out there. Obviously, I know that the greens will speed up over the weekend, but, yeah, that was a little bit disappointing. You've just got to forget about it and push on.

Q. Do you feel like you're in a spot where you can make a run at this tomorrow? 
JASON DAY: I mean, yeah, the big thing is to just kind of assess where the rest of the field is. I know Paul's come in at 7 under, but there's a bunch of great golfers just teeing off now that can take it. The greens are starting to dry out a little bit. It will get a little bit bumpy this afternoon. 
I think tomorrow we'll try to get at least nine holes in and then (inaudible).

Q. With the sun coming out the rest of the week, it should definitely speed up. Do you look forward to that? 
JASON DAY: Yeah. It kind of messed with my feel a little bit. That's why I threeâputted 5. Usually that pin location, if you're down to the right, it's slow up the hill, and then it just falls away very quickly, and I just didn't get any of that. So it kind of messed up my feel, and then you slowly get used to it. 
So hopefully, things speed up a little bit and get back to that fastââ you know, what we're used to, you know what I mean?

Q. It's your birthday today. What do you do this afternoon to celebrate? 
JASON DAY: I'm going to go to the pro shop and buy some clothes, I think. I'll probably try and see if there's a nice sweater in there or something like that because it's nice and warm out.
