Q. When you saw the morning round scores, did that change your strategy going into this and did the course play to what you saw this morning?
JASON DAY: Yeah, it was definitely it looked a lot easier, definitely looked like it was yielding a lot more birdies out there.  And the hard thing is to like not get wrapped up in it, because you can go out there and try and overplay the golf course.  So today I just wanted to try and be patient.  I'm 1-under, currently on the 9th green, so if I can come back tomorrow with softer conditions, I think that I'll be able to try to get some more birdies out there.
