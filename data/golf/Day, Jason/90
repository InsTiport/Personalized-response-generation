JASON DAY: I drove it much better.  I hit a lot of good iron shots and I holed putts.  It's a lot more fun today.  I'm just saying that a lot of people with a lot of smiles walking off today -- a golf course like today.  Not like yesterday.  Or not like what I was yesterday.  I honestly thought I missed the cut, that's why I stormed off.  And I was like, this is going to be my third one in a row, and not the direction that I want to go into, especially the WGC and the PGA.  But I got lucky and I got myself into the cut line and got off to a pretty solid start today and finished off strong.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think this is a good formula to see, maybe the first 62 in a major championship.  Par 3s, there's a couple of par 3 tees are up.  The 5th hole, the par 4 is up.  I hit 3-wood there today.  The conditions are perfect.  I mean the greens are rolling pure.  They're slow, so you can be aggressive.  And then when the greens are receptive the fairways are receptive, you can be very, very, very aggressive, and within reason.
But the pin placements aren't too crazy.  You get yourself in the right positions, you can hole a lot of putts.  And I think I left four in the heart today that would have got me to 9 if I holed those.  So I definitely think there's a good opportunity to shoot 62 out there today.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: Until -- only like a couple of people at tee 16 or something.  I think it was like 9:00 at night or so.  I was sitting there watching it and decided to watch, because he was going back and forth, back and forth.  And it wasn't so much that I was angry at thinking I'm missing the cut.  It was more so I was angry with I was even par with three holes to go.  And I came home in a coffin.
So it was just obviously -- I was honestly thinking I could birdie 17, par 16, birdie 17, par 18, get it to 1-under par and I'm right there.  I come into a golf course such as today, you can get something going pretty quickly and then you throw your name up there.  You've won some tournaments in the past and people know that you've finished off strong.  Hopefully that gives them a little bit of incentive to push on or pull back little bit.
So I was more angry of how I finished yesterday just because kind of shot myself in the foot.  And you can't do that in major championships, especially when you're trying to win a tournament.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: No, I mean, it was kind of hard because I sat there on 16, I hit kind of an average drive just down the right-hand side but I had a clean lie.  Wind was down off the left and I'm thinking, okay, this is a perfect 54, and I hit it and came out with nothing.  It rolled up the slope and came back down in the bunker.  And for some reason bunkers over here, you tend to have one foot out of the bunker.
And from there, you know, the next hole I plugged a drive.  And 18 happened.  I wasn't quite thinking -- my agent actually said a good analogy, it's like the war in the fog.  So with everything going around you, you're trying to think straight but you can't think straight because there's so much going on.  And unfortunately I just didn't quite have my head switched on the last three holes.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: I hope so.  I hope so.  That would be nice if I could shoot that one.  Right now I'm very happy with how I played today.  I think if I can do that and play the way I did today going into tomorrow, there's definitely a chance of shooting 61.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: So I was quiet in the car.  Then I watched a movie.  And then I ate some food and then I went and got some ice cream.  And after I ate some ice cream, I became a lot happier.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: It was The Expendables 2, so it was a bit of action.  I was supposed to go to the gym yesterday.  I'm glad I didn't because I probably would have squatted 500 pounds, I was that angry.  We're in a great position in life.  To be able to play at Royal Birkdale in a major championship is -- we're very gifted.  We're very blessed in a sense to be here.  Sometimes we get in a position that makes us very angry and I'm thinking I'm missing the cut because of my poor play coming in, and fortunately I'm here today and talking to you guys.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: Yeah, well, I think it was -- my wife was saying, "Just go out there and just play.  You've got nothing to lose now, obviously.  You're dead last, anyway.  No matter what you're trying to prove."  It was great to get out there and shoot the score I did.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: Probably the last two cuts I missed.  I missed Travelers and I missed U.S. Open, too.  It's not fun going home early on the weekend, especially when you come across the pond because you don't know what you're doing trying to change flights and all that stuff.  You shouldn't ever think about it.  The biggest thing is you can't think about stuff like that.  You have to come into a week like this, try and prepare the best you can.
Saying that, I get angry all the time.  Even though I don't look angry on the course, I'm stewing inside.  And I feel like I handle it a little bit better than most - instead of throwing a club, I hold it.
I appreciate it.  Thanks.
