Q. You just keep rolling along.
JASON DAY: Yeah, I mean, a little -- it's just not fun obviously stopping and starting.  Came out not as sharp as I was this morning and made some good saves, holed a good putt at 9 to keep the round going and then again on 12.
Then holed a nice one on 13 and hit a great shot into 14.
But fortunately, and unfortunately, right now it's the weather.  Most of the weather is done and we got good weather for the weekend, but, yeah, I was almost ready to pull the trigger on hitting the shot into 15, but I'm just hoping that we can come back tomorrow and the greens can be soft and I can hopefully hit a nice tight one there.
Q. Who decided not to play, all of you or --
JASON DAY: Well, yeah, I think that just going off what we had the last couple days, the greens have been pretty soft and receptive in the morning and just that number is just with a little bit of downwind it's not quite -- I need a shot where I can stop it pretty quick.
I need to take something off a 52 degree wedge.  But, yeah, I think Gracey started first and then I went and then I think Jordan went after that.
Q. You had a chance to put a bigger gap on them in the morning if you can grab a few more birdies coming in?
JASON DAY: Yeah, there's definitely an opportunity on 15, 16 as well.  We're going to have a northwest wind it always starts northwest and then kind of switches back to southwest, south, southeast.
So, 16's obviously going to play downwind.  At seven miles an hour from what I just checked.
And then obviously 17 and 18 are going to play into the wind.  So that will be a little bit tougher, but hopefully I can hit some good solid shots coming in and at least try to get a couple more birdies would be nice.
Q. Is there an advantage for you on 13 to go third after seeing two putts go down that hill?
JASON DAY: Yes, definitely.  To be honest, it was getting to that point where it was getting a little bit too dark.  I couldn't quite see how much -- I could see the down slope, but I couldn't really get the feel of how much slope there was.
So Gracey hit his and then Jordan hit a great putt there as well and once I saw their balls rolling, I could gauge how hard I needed to hit the putt and then, obviously, from there I got it on a nice line and hit the putt.
Q. How much confidence do you have, there's quite a bit of golf left to play, but considering how well you played.
JASON DAY: I feel good about my game, but I think the biggest thing for me is just to really try and focus on just trying to extend the lead.
I'm not saying I've got a boatload of confidence, I feel good about how I'm going about my game, but I just got to understand that this is like a Major and especially with 16, 17 and 18, anything can happen there.  So I got to make sure that I'm switched on when I come through that stretch.
Q. Have you become more comfortable playing here in the past year or so?
JASON DAY: I think so.  But it's still, it's still nerve wracking and it's still hard as ever.  You still are trying to hit the quality shots.
And even so, I'm at 14-under par, I've got a good lead going on, I just can't sit back, I need to keep pushing forward.  And the moment that I start, that I lose a little bit of focus and make a few mental errors and mistakes, that's when I let the field back in.  And I just can't afford to do that.
Q. Isn't that the difference?  In the past, you mentioned 14-under at the start of this week as your number.
JASON DAY: Yeah, no.
Q. When you get there and sort of tread water a bit, whereas now you do exactly what you said and try to keep going?
JASON DAY: Yeah, and with that said, I'm not trying to attack every pin location, I'm not trying to go out there and shoot low scores every single day, but I'm just being patient with myself.  If I make a par on a par-5, then it doesn't matter, it's a par, I can get on to the next hole and try and make a birdie then.  And that's kind of the way I'm thinking about it is, I just got to be patient with myself, don't get too angry, if it is an easy birdie hole, if you make par on it, just keeping keep moving on and make birdies somewhere else.  Because I feel I'm rolling the ball well enough to be able to hole pretty much anything.  That's the way I feel now.
