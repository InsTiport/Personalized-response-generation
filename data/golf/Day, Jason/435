 Q. Tell us about the day. 
 JASON DAY: It was a long day. I got off to -- after five holes, I had two birdies and two bogeys, and I bogeyed the last hole which is a little frustrating. I hit it well this morning, and I knew that if I could bring that the swing into today's round, I could just hole a few more putts and I could get my day going. 
 I played very well tee-to-green I thought, and I rolled in a few nice putts. I left a few out there, but with any good round, you're going to leave a few out there, so I'm happy about it. 
 I was playing my game and I just got off to a great start. It's just golf. Sometimes you can get off to a really bad start and come home strong. I got off to a great start. I fell asleep in the middle there, and I was still playing really good golf, and lipped out a few times for birdie, but I'm glad I got a birdie on 16 and 17 just to finish off the round nicely. 

 Q. Glad to be done --
 JASON DAY: Yes, I am. I've left the puppies there for at least eight hours today by themselves; so I'm sure there's going to be a big smell and some stains, so hopefully not. 

 Q. When you left on Thursday, you had a headache and you needed to rest. I mean, how has the health been?
 JASON DAY: Today, started on 8, on the 8th hole through to, I want to say, 14, I felt really bad out there. 
 The feeling is this -- this is what I feel when you're coming down and you're in the hunt to win a tournament and your hands are shaking a little bit, and you feel a little light-headed; that's what I felt like out there. 
 I wasn't nervous at all out there. I felt like I was playing pretty well. It was just a health thing I think. I try to drink as much water and I try to eat as much as I could. I'm just glad I got through those holes, which was nice.

 Q. Do you know when it's coming that you're going to have to bear down even more? 
 JASON DAY: Yeah, I don't know when it's coming, but I know when it starts, I have to focus twice as hard to hit the shots that I need to. 
 And you know, I'm just hoping that I can get 100 percent healthy, so I just feel somewhat good out there. 
 Feels really good, I can tell you that much. I'm just trying to play it as a normal tournament. I know it's a major and you can obviously feel it's a different tournament out here. But I'm just trying to handle myself just as any normal tournament and just trying to stick to my routine and trying to stick to my game plan and hopefully it will come through tomorrow. 

 Q. Second major this year? 
 JASON DAY: It's my second one. This is No. 2. I'm having fun. I'm just enjoying myself and I'm just trying to be very disciplined and trying to stay patient out there. I think that's what you need to do in majors. So hopefully over the next day or so. 

 Q. Seems like the training wheels are coming off quick out here now. 
 JASON DAY: You just have to look at the young kids coming up. Before you would see a lot of the guys, come out of college, give them a couple of years and they start playing well. Now there's 19-, 17-year-olds out here that are playing very, very well. 
 It's the kind of course that you can come out and do well if you are hitting the ball really well. It's a ball-striking course and there's a lot of really good ball-strikers out there. 

 Q. Goals for the year? 
 JASON DAY: You know, there's a few more goals that I would like to achieve. I would like to get inside the Top-50 by the end of this year. I have a few certain money goals that I wanted to get to, and obviously one of my goals was to win. 
 So after the win, I had to reassess everything and start over again, because you know, once you win, the biggest thing on your goal list, it's easy to just, you know, kind of relax and sit down. That was the best time for me to reassess everything and redo my goals and try and move forward. 

 Q. Did you expect to be in the position you are now? 
 JASON DAY: Someone asked me this question at the start of the week, and I said I would be lying to you if I said I was. This is my second major, and I'm just soaking in the experience right now. 
 You know, there's a lot of guys out there that have major experience, but like I said, I'm just going to try and treat it as just a normal tournament and just try and go out there and just play my own game and not worry about, you know, the leaderboard, and hopefully, I can do that tomorrow and be somewhere around the lead. 

 Q. Did you catch a glimpse of Elkington's score today and what he's done? He's 8-under now.
 JASON DAY: Really? 

 Q. It's not all young guys. 
 JASON DAY: Wow, I did not know that. 

 Q. A couple dinosaurs. 
 JASON DAY: Yeah, there you go. (Laughter) It's a good mix this week, which is nice. 

 Q. What do you know about him? You're so young. 
 JASON DAY: I don't know. When did he come over to college? What year was that? Yeah, I was born in '87. So no disrespect, he's obviously done a lot in his career. He won the PGA, ten career PGA TOUR wins -- anyone that's won a major and has ten PGA TOUR career wins is doing something right. It's good to see him back up there. 

 Q. Did you see on TV when he won? 
 JASON DAY: I was eight. I think I was watching Sesame Street. 

 Q. Or Caddyshack?
 JASON DAY: I love that movie.

 Q. When you were coming up, when you were younger, what was your expectations and what were your dreams about getting into this position, like Sunday, you're in the running at a major. Did you dream about that sort of stuff?
 JASON DAY: I dreamt about winning, being the first Australian to win the Masters. That's the biggest thing. I think every Australian is probably want be to the first Australian to win the Masters. 
 But to be in this position today, I never dreamt I would be here, especially where I came up and what I had to go through to get to where I am today, I'm very thankful to how everything panned out in my life. 
 And how, you know, I was in boarding school when I read a book about Tiger Woods and that pretty much changed my whole life. You never know, I could have been back home checking out groceries back home. I'm happy where I am today and I've got no complaints I'm happy with everything. 

 Q. Do you have pictures of anyone growing up? 
 JASON DAY: I tell you, there was one magazine, a Golf Digest magazine that had all the old school swings, and my favorite swing, ever, was Nick Faldo's swing. And it had all the greats, Ernie Els and Nick Faldo and all that stuff and I had the pictures of their swing sequences on my wall. 

 Q. All of the old school guys. 
 JASON DAY: The 40-year-olds. (Laughter).
