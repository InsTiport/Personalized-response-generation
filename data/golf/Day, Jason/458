   NELSON SILVERIO: Thanks for spending a few minutes with us today. Currently tied for the lead going into the weekend. Just give us some thoughts on the round.  
 JASON DAY: I played pretty solid on my Back 9. Got off to a little bit of a shaky start, missed a few greens with a 9-iron and 8-iron and a wedge and didn't get up-and-down, and came back pretty strong, actually, on my Back 9, which was the front nine. Birdied all of the par-5s -- birdied three of the par-5s and eagled one as well, so that kind of saved me.   
 I holed a lot of good 15, 20-foot putts out there and kept myself out of trouble.  
 NELSON SILVERIO: You had some good support out there. How has Puerto Rico treated you so far?   
 JASON DAY: It's been great. I love it down here. It's been good. The gnats weren't too good to me out there, just this afternoon, but the course is in great condition, and the facilities here, and obviously the resort is great, so I'm very happy with where I'm staying right now.  
 NELSON SILVERIO: Questions?   
  
  Q. Some of the other players have been talking about some adjustments they've had to make to deal with the rain and the winds. What have you had to do today to kind of deal with the weather?  
 JASON DAY: I guess it's not more of an adjustment. I just -- you know, I've adjusted to some of the flies out of the rough, obviously. I give myself about 10 to 15 yards extra if I'm hitting flies out of the rough.   
 But the winds, they can switch and swirl around, but we just played it pretty much 10 to 15 all day, and I've been actually hitting it a little bit longer down here than I have been, so it's just about five yards longer than my normal clubs have been going, so it's not much adjustment. Just trying to keep it in play and hole some putts.  
  
  Q. Is the back better than the front, and also were you happy with your putting today?  
 JASON DAY: Yeah. I'm very confident with my game right now. I worked really hard in the weeks that I've had off, and it's just great to be in the position that I am now.   
 Obviously it's the first time I've been in this position going into the weekend, and I'm just going to soak it up and try to get some strength out of it and just play my game. If I can go out there and just play my game and get my shots high and try to hole some putts we'll see how it goes at the end of the week.   
  
  Q. Any strategy for tomorrow?  
 JASON DAY: Same for tomorrow. Just pretty much playing exactly the way I've been playing. It's been going great. I've just gotta hit some fairways, hit greens and hole some putts.   
 I haven't been too aggressive out there. I've been hitting it to the side of the pins, and that's been working out great. I'm striking the ball really well, and I'm very happy with that, and my putt is rolling very good. Speed of my putt has been great. So I've gotta go out there and just try to do exactly what I've been doing the last two days, and if it happens, it happens and if it doesn't, it doesn't. I'm very happy with where I am at right now.  
  
  Q. How many tournaments have you participated?  
 JASON DAY: This year? This is my fourth one this year. So I played Buick, Pebble and Mayakoba. This is my fourth one. So I'm looking for some more.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible question).  
 JASON DAY: No, I don't. Actually I've got 126 to 150. I'm in the conditional category. Pretty much I've gotta win to get full status. So hopefully this week. (Laughs).  
 NELSON SILVERIO: All right, Jason, thanks a lot.
