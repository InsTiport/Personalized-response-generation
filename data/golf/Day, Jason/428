   DOUG MILNE: We'll like to welcome Jason day after a successful first match, 3 and 2 win for you. Nice going.
 Just a few general comments about the round, the day, the course, and then we'll take a few questions.
 JASON DAY: Yeah, I cannot remember what I did out there today, so I wish I had -- yeah, I won. I wish I had that little paper in front of me so I knew exactly what I did.
 There was a little bit of a wind out there today. Actually it was blowing from the southwest and kind of switched to southeast, southwest all day. It was gusting a little bit. But the course played relatively shorter than normal. The fairways were running and the greens were pretty firm. So it was just all about just placing your ball in the right positions out there today and then obviously capitalizing when you could.
 DOUG MILNE: Before we take questions, I just wanted to ask you, obviously a Presidents Cup year, and you're currently, I think, 11th in the standings. 
 JASON DAY: Yeah. 
 DOUG MILNE: How much is is that on your mind, especially at tournaments like this? 
 JASON DAY: It's, you know, I'd like to play The Presidents Cup, especially it being down in Royal Melbourne in Australia, and just to play in front of the local crowd would be a fantastic honor to play there. Right now I'm not focus on that at all. If I can focus on what I'm doing right now, and I play well, it will take care of itself. So right now I'm just trying to focus on what I do in the present. 

 Q. Circling back to what I was teasing you about on the range this morning, could you sort of elaborate about your match play experience, Ryan Palmer hadn't played in 20 years, and he won his match today, so apparently whatever the secret is you guys figured it out?
 JASON DAY: Yeah, I haven't played match play since I was an amateur, so that's going back since I was 18, so five years.
 I've always been a pretty good solid match play player, but it's obviously different as a professional. I had a tough match. We were going back and forth. And then I won three straight holes, which made it a little easier out there today. But it's just different strategy. I made him putt in a one and a half foot putt on the first hole, just to, you know, say, I'm not going to give you any of those. Just to know that, you know, it's going to be a hard match to play. 
 There's no nice guys out here, you're friends with them, but it's me versus the guy I'm playing against. And at the end of the day I'm going to shake his hand and say congratulations if he wins, or if I win I'm going to be very happy. It's competing. It feels like it's a Sunday out there and you've got to do what you need to do to win. 

 Q. You mentioned the three-hole run, it came after on 10 where you put your drive into the rubbish. Must have been good to come back from that, just let it go, you picked up halfway down the fairway. To be able to come back from that hole and put a run on?
 JASON DAY: Yeah, that's probably one of the biggest things I've been working on, after hitting it into the stuff on the right on 10, just to get over the shot. The shot's gone. There's no need to, you know, worry about what just happened or worry about what's going to happen. I think I did well today just trying to stay, you know, in the present and just trying to take it a shot at a time. And I went on a really nice run there and birdied 11, parred 12 and birdied 13, which was really, really nice. That kind of got my round going a little bit in the right direction. And capped it off with two solid birdies to beat him 3 and 2, which was nice.

 Q. 40-footer to finish, too, is not bad?
 JASON DAY: No, it was good. You know what, it was kind of going a little quick, too, so I'm glad it hit the hole. 

 Q. We noticed right off the bat on the first hole when he hit it into trouble and you switched from 3-wood to an iron?
 JASON DAY: Yep.

 Q. Was that a match play decision, I guess?
 JASON DAY: Yes, obviously I didn't hit the 3-iron too great. I left myself like 220 yards to the hole. But then I came back and hit a great, solid shot into the first hole. And it only had to go a foot and it would have been down the bottom of that hill, inside six feet. So it was a good shot. So just doing that, you know, like obviously he hit into the trash. I hit my iron down the middle. If I hit on the green, if I hit a good one, that putts pressure on to him to hit a good shot, as well. He knew that I was up there close to the hole and he pulled his left, so if he didn't get up-and-down I would have probably gone 1-up. 
 But just little things like that, if someone hits it in the rubbish, you've just got to, you know, take the risk versus reward. If you want to go for it and hit driver, you can. But if you want to layup and try to put some pressure on him, then that's it.

 Q. You mentioned making the short putt to start. Were there any other kind of match play mind games going on the rest of the way?
 JASON DAY: I think just to show that it was all upbeat, but I made the choice to walk in front of him all the time, to be in front of him, just to show him that I was there, show him that I'm still around, instead of walking behind him and him being in front. So it was a little bit of a tactic to say, I'm still here, I'm still going to fight and I'm going to try and win as good as I could. 
 DOUG MILNE: Thanks for your time.
