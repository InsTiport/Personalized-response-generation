  Q. Can you just kind of walk us through 16 and just kind of, were those your binoculars, do you keep those in the bag?
 JASON DAY:   No, no.  Mike came over and he, I don't know where he got the rules official to come over and he, I don't know where he got the binoculars it from, but it was actually the forever that came in and zoomed in on it and I've got the ball well I don't have the ball but like I could see the Tour B XS on the logo on the side and I'm like, That's it, that's perfect.
 So a little unfortunate that it got stuck up, it was literally in a nest, so I think the mama birdie's going to come back and find another egg there, so it's unfortunate, but it is what it is.
 Q. Can you talk about, you know, playing this event after the last two years, not getting to play and what it means to you to be back and also playing pretty well?
 JASON DAY:   Yeah, it was -- yeah it's always nice to be able to come to Florida, play, especially at Arnie's place.  This is a very special place to me.  I used to live here when I first came over here to America, I mean like only five minutes down the road, so to be able to be here, I know the last few years haven't been, haven't panned out the right way, but my body's feeling tremendous and I feel good about where I'm at, so I just got to keep pushing along.
 Q. I'm sure you're standing on that 16th tee thinking of 3 and you walk off with 7.  What kind of gut punch is that and can you talk about kind of fighting back?
 JASON DAY:   It was more of a gut punch on 18 than 16.  So to go double, par double and then just realize -- I know that there was opportunities outs here, especially on the front side because Rory went low yesterday, there was a number of guys that went low, so there's definitely two par-5s that you can get birdie chances at and then there's some opportunities elsewhere, but you just got to kind of go, Okay, new nine, like just relax, don't do anything silly.  So you just got to keep pushing along.
 Q. In all the golf you've played, have you had one stick in a tree?
 JASON DAY:   No, that's a first time.  Yeah, that's the first time.  So -- and first time to sit -- I mean because it was just like one of these trees here, so it's like there's nothing for it to hold up, other than a nest.  So it's unfortunate but I'm glad we found it in the end.
