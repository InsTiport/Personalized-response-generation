 Q.  Just a little bit of a strange day for you.  You are moving on to the fourth round.  Comments about that?  
JASON DAY: It's obviously something that you don't want to -- you see someone go out like that, when you are playing a match play event and it's a heated battle and competition, you want to try and -- look, I'll take it.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing for me.   
It's definitely a good thing for me to be able to get some more rest and try and rest my back and get some good therapy going on my back.  If I can make it all the way through Sunday that means I'm playing 72 holes on the weekend, which is a lot of golf.   
Unfortunately, Paul didn't feel that great.  It happened to him last year, as well, against Rory.  These things pop up and unfortunately just got to --   
 Q.  Anything you are working on?  
JASON DAY: I wasn't really pleased with how I putted yesterday.  The speed was off.   
Today, similar thing, I 3-putted 2.  These putts are relatively easy with the speed and my speed is way off.  Started thinking about speed out there.  Once you start thinking about it then you may as well not have a go at it.  I just wanted to go and make sure that I got the drills going again that usually get my speed back to normal and did a few of those and made sure that I stayed wary of my back and bending over.  It feels pretty good.  So hopefully it responds well for tomorrow.
