 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
JASON DAY:   I was too lazy to actually get my shoes thrown over.   I either hit it in my bare feet or put my shoes on and have to take my shoes off.   I was like, we're going to be behind, way behind, so I may as well just hit it with no shoes on.   It was a great 4 there, a lucky 4.   
We both went back and forth, me and Rory.   Two holes later, he hit left and got up and down for par as well.   So one hole there.   
Little disappointing today with the putter.   Couple of loose drives but just didn't capitalize on the opportunities that I had out there.   I'm going to try and work it out this evening to see if I can get anything going tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What does the birdie on the last do for confidence?   
JASON DAY:   I mean, he made a good birdie there.   If I didn't make birdie, I was 4 back.   That's a very low number that I have to shoot tomorrow to try to beat him, whoever is close to him as well.   
It just makes things a lot easier with how things went.   It was a just a poor bogey on 16, bad drive.   I was a little frustrated with the putting today, just didn't look like it was going to go in.   I didn't feel like it was going to go in, so I was a little uncomfortable out there.   To be able to knock that 6‑foot putt in there for birdie made things easier for me to not ‑‑ just gave me a boost of confidence knowing that I'm just three back rather than four back.  
   
 Q.   After the frustrations you've had this year, as recently as last week, does it feel good to be in contention?  
JASON DAY:   Yeah, I mean, there's some nerves in there at the start of the round.   If you haven't been there for a little bit, it's more nervous to be in contention.   Then say, for instance, Rory has won the last two tournaments that he's played in.  
Obviously I'm trying to get back on my feet right now.   With all the frustrations, with injuries, withdrawing last week, I wasn't the greatest preparation coming to this event.   I worked pretty hard over the last week, bar the vertigo, I'm in contention right now.   Got one day left.   We'll see how it goes.   I'm still positive with how I'm playing.   I feel like I'm playing pretty good golf.   I shot 65 yesterday, so it's definitely out there.   
Hopefully they set the course up reasonably well out there tomorrow.   Hopefully we can go low.
