JASON DAY: Hitting more fairways, give myself more opportunities on the green.   
You miss fairways here, you can't get it close to the pin.  So, and you can't rely on putting it -- it, it's hard to hole the putts from 50 feet away.  So I got to hit the fairways so that's the plan.   
 Q.  If it becomes apparent early that it's an eight shot difference at all to Henrik or Jordan or whatever --  
JASON DAY: Then Sunday rounds are different, too, than the other three other rounds, because there's a lot more pressure.   
After tomorrow, there's no more days.  So it's -- there's a lot more pressure on tomorrow's round.   
So, if I can get off to a good start and hit it a lot better off the tee, a lot straighter, that would be nice.  Give myself a lot more opportunities.  At least -- if I get to four or five on the front nine that would be nice.   
 Q.  Obviously, I don't know if you know the scenarios or whatever, but you'll stay at No. 1 if Henrik wins.  If Jordan wins, then you need to get to the top-5?  
JASON DAY: Well, I'm not worrying about that.  Not worrying about that right now.   
I just want to try and -- because I played good to get there.  I know that it's going to be a lot of change between the three of us, and I just got to go out and try and play the best I can tomorrow.   
It would be great to hold on to it, but right now I'm just going to focus on playing good golf.   
 Q.  This is your first situation being in this situation where you win you can win it all.  Is there any kind of different kind of pressure that you feel?  
JASON DAY: No, not really.  It's just I haven't been close to the lead at all.  Henrik got off to a great start.   
I was 1-under, six back, then didn't play that great in the second round, played okay today.   
But these guys are just -- they're good, so it's -- once again, it's tough to advance yourself when you're not driving it straight here.  Unfortunately, that's just how it's happened.   
 Q.  You will get a chance to go out earlier than them and maybe get that hot start?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, if I can get that hot start because it's still going to be difficult.   
So, it's going to be wet and if these guys start missing a few fairways and then it's hard to get close to the green or get it up around there and they don't hole the putts, obviously things can happen.
