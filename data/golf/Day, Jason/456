   MARK STEVENS: We'd like to welcome Jason Day to the media room. If you would kind of go through your round today, and obviously the finish at 18, and then we'll take a few questions.   
 JASON DAY: I got off to a pretty rough start. I double-bogeyed the second par-5, and you can't make those mistakes on par-5s. And pretty much that cost me the tournament.   
 And I started hitting it really well coming on the Back 9, and I was playing really good, and I felt good about my game. And I knew that putt on the par-5 at 15 would come back to get me. I missed that short one, and you just can't miss those in pressure situations.   
 I'm disappointed that I couldn't finish it off, but I'm very happy with myself that I actually put myself into contention, and I held my head up, and I nearly won the tournament.   
 So I know there's going to be plenty more wins coming my way as long as I work hard and keep moving forward, but that 18th hole I just hit a drive down the middle, hit the 5-iron just right in the bunker and hit a great bunker shot.   
 I thought it was going to roll down a little bit more than that, and I just missed it low side on the left, and I didn't think it was going to break that much. Looked like it was going in the whole way, and just missed it down the low side.  
 Overall I'm very happy, though.  
 MARK STEVENS: Please raise your hand if you have questions and use the microphone.  
  
  Q. Congratulations.   
 JASON DAY: Thank you.  
  
  Q. That final putt, did you just misread it a bit? It just missed the hole.   
 JASON DAY: I read it to go a little right-to-left. I didn't think it was going to go that much to the left. I hit a great putt.   
 I tell you what, my whole body was shaking over that putt, and you know, it's the third time I've ever been in this position on the PGA TOUR.   
 I've been in this position before on the NATIONWIDE Tour, but it's totally different from the NATIONWIDE to the PGA TOUR, and I just missed it low, so I hit a great putt. So I'm very happy with it.  
  
  Q. Can you talk a little bit about your partner's play today?  
 JASON DAY: Yeah. Michael Bradley, I met him in '06. We played a tournament together, and we've been really good buddies from then, and I'm very happy to see him win.  
 He's obviously got a two-year exemption now on the PGA TOUR, which he should because he's such a good player.   
 He's just a great guy to be around, very friendly with everyone. I'm very happy to see him play well and win a tournament. So you know, all the best to him, and hopefully we can have another showdown a little bit later.   
  
  Q. Tell us about the tournament, how you see the tournament. It was a good tournament for you and coming for the 2010.   
 JASON DAY: Yeah. The course is great. I really do like the course a lot, you know. You get your mixture of hard holes and easy holes, and the way they set up the course this week was very playable. The greens got really firm towards the end, but you had to play fast and that's what everyone else had. And the tournament itself was a great tournament, and the field with the people around, just wanted everyone to do well. I had a lot of support out there today from everyone, and it was really good.  
  
  Q. And it was quite windy and a little wet at the end. How did it affect you personally and all of the players at the end do you think?  
 JASON DAY: I think there were a few groups at the end that got affected by the rain and the wind.   
 You know, the wind got pretty heavy on the Back 9, and then it started to rain on 17, when we were on 17 tee. And it was only around for like five minutes, but the wind was the big thing there, and you know, you just have to play for it. We play in the wind pretty much every week out here, so you just have to play for it and try and do your best.  
 MARK STEVENS: Any last questions? Everybody good? Okay. Thank you, Jason, for coming in. Appreciate it.   
 JASON DAY: Thanks.
