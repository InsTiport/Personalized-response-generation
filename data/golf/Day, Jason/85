Q. Did you find something?
JASON DAY: Yeah, today is quite strange.  I was just explaining -- it's kind of ban that year, really.
I've had some really solid, stellar rounds and then had some pretty much awful rounds that you just don't expect that's going to come out of your game.  I told Col earlier this morning that I was like, this is going to be a tough one today.  I just knew it deep down, like I wasn't quite there, switched on mentally, even though I'm like trying to get myself into it.  It's hard, and 5-over through the front side.
Ended up turning it around the back side, which is nice.  Actually even though I shot 1-over, it's positive going forward.
Q. What were you thinking walking off the 10th green?
JASON DAY: Even after the double on 7, I just kept on telling myself, "It's all right.  Don't worry about it.  Don't do anything more stupid than what you're doing right now, and hopefully give yourself new opportunities."
And I knew the back side was a lot easier than the front side.  I just had to give myself fairway opportunities.  Get on the fairway.  I mean, I just wasn't doing any of that out there on the front side.  It's been quite a difficult year for me to find the fairway.  I've got some added distance back now, which is nice, and I took advantage of it, which was good.
You know, hit a nice wedge shot into 11.  Hit a good drive down 12, hit another good drive down 13, and then hit a great shot into the 15th hole.
So it was just -- it was really easy for me out there on the back side, and very, very difficult on the front side.  Hopefully the lead stays at six and I'm not too far behind.  I'm at even far, considering what I did on the front side today, not too bad.
Q. Is mental fatigue to be expected at this time of year?
JASON DAY: I don't have any mental fatigue.  I haven't played any golf -- I understand.  I understand.  We did just play a major championship two weeks ago.
But, I mean, I took a week off.  Sometimes I just go on a walkabout out there in my round, and I'm trying to control it, but I get distracted somehow.  I think if I can control that better -- don't get me wrong, I'm trying my hardest to shoot a good score.  I might just be getting in my own way.
Q. Dustin said the turnaround in his play is the result of him not doing anything last week, going to the Bahamas, spearfishing and not touching a golf club --
JASON DAY: That's what he does most weeks (laughter).
Q. Maybe you need to get -- that front side was so awful, you could stop worrying about --
JASON DAY: In a sense.  I understand what you're saying, trying to get away from it a little bit.  It's hard because it's a double-edged sword, really.  Because the way that confidence works in the game of golf is that you have the potential, you work at it; then you get the result and that feeds into the confidence.  So it's a quick upward spiral and it works exact opposite when you're playing poorly, too.
So you take some time off, you're playing bad, you've got no confidence, the results aren't happening, and you're not motivated to practice.  I haven't had the results that I have had in the past.  I've just got to keep working hard.
I'm not like Dustin Johnson.  I don't know how the guy does it.  He's just a very super-talented golfer that is able to do a little bit less work than most guys and get away it, because he's super long, and any sort of work that he does do, it happens on the golf course and works out for him.  I've always been a guy that had to work very, very hard to get to where I am, and I'm trying to do that right now.
