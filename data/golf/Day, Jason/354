Q.   We were just talking about you've got the right stuff.   You had a chance at the Masters, had a chance at the U.S. Open.   When you play places like this, does it kind of get your juices flowing a little bit more than perhaps your regular events? 
JASON DAY:   Every event is important, every other tournament we play during the year, but I've had good success around this course.   I played pretty well out there today.   Had a lot of point shots out there. 
Hopefully, over the next three days, I get a lot of hole shots.   Very happy with how I played.   Looking forward to the next few days.

Q.   What does it say about you're team, that 1 under and you're playing well and matched up together? 
JASON DAY:   It's a U.S. Open course, and I feel like it's playing just as long as a U.S. Open course.   Now, there's a few tees up today, but it was a tough old day. 
Wind was kind of swirling a little bit.   We're lucky we skirted the weather.   I think, we have to do better for the next three days, this course won't be too hard.

Q.   A lot of people were talking the last couple of days about you, and Leish and Scotty playing in the same group, three Australians.   Does it get old after a while playing in cool groups like that?   Or do you still enjoy seeing your name on a sheet alongside a guy who's a Masters champion? 
JASON DAY:   I really enjoy playing.   I played amateur golf with Leish, and I've known Scotty since I was 15.   All three of us go way back.   We really enjoy each other's company. 
I know that Scotty and Leish probably wanted to play a little bit better.   There's still three days left.   I think we're all going to enjoy tomorrow and getting into it.

Q.   You're a young man.   I don't know if 15 is way back, but thanks for the time.   I appreciate it.
