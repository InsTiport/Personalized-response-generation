  THE MODERATOR:   Jason Day, thanks so much for joining us today.   You finished at minus 3, minus 6 for the week.   Can you give us your thoughts on the round.
JASON DAY:   It's hot.   It's hot out there today.   I haven't played in heat like that for a while.   And I guess that's why they call it Hotlanta, eh? 
But you know what, it was enjoyable.   To not‑‑ to not have my real caddie on the bag is obviously a disappointment. 
But hopefully he's healing up.   But for me to do my own yardages and all that stuff reminds me of the old junior and amateur days.
And it's interesting.   It just feels different not having my guy on the bag.   But it's been an enjoyable 36 holes walking with Jason, and I'm looking forward to the next two rounds.

Q.   Your concentration ‑‑
JASON DAY:   I think it's a bit of both.   I really have to focus on making sure that the yardages are correct, when it's just yourself, when it's Colin and myself, then you kind of rely on each other because if you stuff up, you have someone to back up on you. 
But Jason's never really done a yardage in his life.   So I have to make sure that I'm focused at getting the yardages. 
It's been kind of a weird week.   Obviously withdrawing from last week, having the bad back and Colin not being able to carry because of his back and the weather, not having your normal caddie on the bag it's been a funny week.   But the commitment level is nice. 
I feel committed to the shot.   Kind of work something out a little bit on the back nine with my driving because obviously the driving was everywhere today on the front nine.   And worked out something on the back nine and kind of went with it, started driving it straight up.

Q.   Perhaps that's more impressive making an adjustment Colin is your coach as well sees those things runs you through them as you play?
JASON DAY:   Every now and then everyone, every player out there that has a caddie always plays the same, what did you see there, what did you feel.   I very rarely ask him out on the course because obviously I'm trying to get the ball in the hole.
But it was a, just a small change that I needed to make not get too far inside, make sure I'm more out ahead of myself and hit more on the ball.   It's pretty simple.
I've been swinging the golf club since I was six so I should kind of know something about the swing.   But once again played great over the last two days and looking forward to the opportunity over the next two days.

Q.   Considering last week the way you are now, could you shed some thoughts going into the weekend, how you feel, your approach?
JASON DAY:   Still not 100percent because I can still feel it.   But I mean that's just injuries.   I can still feel my thumb.   Playing injured‑‑ or playing with little niggling injuries it's definitely not the spot you want to be in.   But it's something where you just have to suck it up and play and try and fight for the win. 
And that's really what it boils down to is just if I want it enough.   I've got to want it more than the guy that's leading now and the guys that are chasing it.   If I can do it and focus and start to turn things around off the tee and give myself a lot more opportunities on the greens, then with the way I'm putting I feel like I can really push forward in this tournament.

Q.   Certainly no one's owed anything in this world but do you feel like after a season you've had it would be a nice little karma payback at least have a good finish?
JASON DAY:   Yeah.   It's been a frustrating year.   The body has not performed the way it's supposed to and golf wise it's been great.   This is my 15th event for the year and I've played pretty solid golf winning a bunch of top tens is nice but I'm always expecting more of myself. 
I set the bar so high that sometimes I get disappointed and frustrated with small things like a thumb or a back injury because it keeps you out of the game for a while.   And you see guys winning on TOUR each and every week, and you're out sitting on the couch or going through rehab, it's frustrating and motivating at the same time, because you know that if you're out there, you can compete and win especially with how I started this year. 
But with that said, I think in the offseason I've got to take a handle of my injuries and move forward and hopefully I don't have any problems in the future.

Q.   Jason, paint a picture for us, please, about how tough this elite field is to actually win this tournament, 29 players here.   Really elite field combined with the toughness of the course.   Paint that picture for us, please. 
JASON DAY:   It's not deep.   Obviously there's not a lot of players.   Normally we're playing anywhere between 100 and 150 players. 
So there's a lot more competition that way. 
But the class of the players that are playing this week are world class.   It's difficult to win tournaments, it really is.   The course, the 18th hole is a brutal par 3.   I hit 3‑iron into it today and obviously made the bogey, but it's a tough par 3 to finish on.   I think it would be great if they flipped the 9s and finished on the par 5 9th hole.   I think it will be a lot more exciting for the fans and a lot more exciting for the golfers as well.
But overall the course is always in immaculate condition when we come because there's only 30‑‑ 29 guys that are walking the golf course. 
It's phenomenal.   We typically have pretty good weather.   But I think the rough is at two and a quarter inches or so.   Like I said earlier, it's premium on hitting fairways.   If you don't hit the fairways, it's very, very difficult to give yourself opportunities on the greens and therefore score the way you want it to.

Q.   You mentioned the frustrations and all that, but what sort of‑‑ what does it say about you this is 15 events like you said and you are in position to potentially win not only this event but the entire season?   There's plenty of positives there obviously?
JASON DAY:   I think it goes two ways.   Obviously there's frustration with the body, but then again I've had a bit of time to prepare, mentally prepare, physically prepare the best I can for those tournaments.   Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, a few other guys played sort of limited schedule but they prepare mentally and physically for those tournaments. 
With myself, I've known where kind of where the body was at.   And to be able to choose my tournaments is obviously a good opportunity for me to prepare for those tournaments.   Really when you're inside the top 50, there's kind of a different sort of Tour because you're playing in the WGC events and the majors and you know there's a certain amount of tournaments that are big big tournaments that you know you need to perform and play well. 
My whole year is kind of geared around the majors and those big tournaments so that I can prepare and play the best I can in those tournaments. 
I've had to mentally focus a lot harder with the injuries on the golf course.   Sometimes you feel like you want to just pack it in and walk away and take the rest of the year off.   But I have an opportunity to win the FedExCup.   Like I had the opportunity to win four majors this year. 
I'm not going to stop until it's over and we'll see how it goes. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
