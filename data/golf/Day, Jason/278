  JASON DAY: I felt relatively good and felt strong after 12 holes.  I'm guessing I'll take some time off and get a handle on this.   Q.  With the golfing world sort of pulling for you, and I think the sporting world, as well, the situation that you chose to soldier on.  What effect did that have on your performance and physical condition?  So many people became fans and became attentive of you playing, how would that affect your play, knowing people were concerned, as well as the viewing audience, as well?  JASON DAY: I was taken by the fact that so many people supported me.  I really made a lot of Jason Day fans out there this week, even though it didn't end up the way I wanted it to end up.  I fought a good fight.  And I think everybody that watched the telecast knows that I never gave up.  It was a battle.
