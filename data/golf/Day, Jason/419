 Q. This is a lot of pressure out here. You looked like you were having a tremendous time. Were you feeling the heat?
 JASON DAY: I certainly was. I couldn't do any more than what I just did today, and me and Adam played wonderful golf out there, and Charl has played even better golf. He's obviously hit a good shot into 18 so he's got two putts for par, and we'll see how it goes.

 Q. Playing with Adam, did that make it a little easier for you today?
 JASON DAY: Yeah, it did. I've known Adam since I was 15, so it's obviously -- we've been good mates since then, and we just had a lot of fun today. It was really, really good to be in the hunt for the Masters, and obviously to be one of the first Aussies to win the Masters was special, too.
