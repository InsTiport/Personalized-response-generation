 Q.  Take us through your round and where you stand through two rounds?  
JASON DAY: I feel good.  I can't be disappointed with how I played.  I would have loved to get a couple back on that back side, but I think overall, it's good position going into the weekend.   
Bubba, he's got some good control with his ball, and he's going to be tough to catch but I think the weekend is going to be a challenge out there with how the weather is going to be.  It's going to make the fairways bounce and roll a little bit more and it's going to make the greens a little harder to hit if you miss the fairway.  Overall I think it's a good position.   
 Q.  Issues with the back today?  
JASON DAY: It's a little tight.  Which is understandable.  Just trying to manage that.  I'm trying to manage the recovery and rest, as well, but I'm not complaining.  I can still swing at the ball pretty hard and still hit the shots that I need to hit, but you know, my main concern tonight is just to get some rest and then just get into tomorrow's round and try and play the best I can.
