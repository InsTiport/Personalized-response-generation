 Q.  Four birdies.  You kind of woke up.  What happened?  
JASON DAY: I don't know.  I got off to a good start and then just I struggled just kind of putting on the greens today.  Hitting into the -- the whole day was tough -- but just on the greens was just really tough.  On the last hole I had an eight foot, seven inch putt for birdie and left it like a foot and a half short.  It was just only because of when I hit the putt a massive gust of breeze came.  I mean I don't really typically think I could leave those short, especially up the hill.  But so that was a toughest putt today was just trying to get, making sure you hit it on the right gust.  Because if you got the wrong gust you could make a fool of yourself.  So to be able to get in at 4-under was nice.  It was a good start to the week, so I just got to keep trying to keep that momentum.   
 Q.  It's great to see and a lot is going on, new baby in the family.  You've been very busy, I guess the whole family has been busy?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, we have.  I've actually got the family here.  I've actually got the whole crew here, which is very expensive, but it's good to have them on the road again.  My boy just out of school, so for us to enjoy, with all the miscarriage that Ellie went through and then the new baby, we're very blessed and it's been a nice little get away.  Obviously after the second half of last year wasn't the greatest for me and to be able to focus on something else with the baby coming into our arms now, it's nice to be able to change the priorities.   
 Q.  Lastly about golf.  What about this year?  What are the goals?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, obviously always to try and win a major.  No, I won twice last year, so if I can win three times and add a major, that would be very successful year, I think.  But I've just got to keep checking the boxes as my agent says.  As long as I can do that hopefully the results fall my way and the confidence starts to kick in and I can really start working in overdrive.  And hopefully if that all goes well, then my second major will come.  But I just got to be patient with it.
