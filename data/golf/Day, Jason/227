 Q.  Just not your day out there today?  
JASON DAY: No, I played terrible.  Just couldn't control my ball flight in the wind, and had it going both ways.  So I mean, when you have it going both ways, you just can't trust anything.  I flat-out played bad.   
It's all good.  I mean, we've still got some matches out there, so hopefully the boys can pull through.   
 Q.  And you powered at the end, you chipped in on 13, you made something of it looked like until the end.  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I was just trying to grind out as hard as I could.  I mean, I was just trying to push and push and push, because I know the guys needed my match.  Got a little unlucky with the lie on the 16th hole.  Zach hit a fantastic shot.  But yeah, for it to lip-out on the chip was a little harsh, but I shouldn't have been there in the first place.   
I'm just hoping the guys have a good one coming in.
