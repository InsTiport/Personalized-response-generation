Q.   What's the overriding sort of emotion right now?
JASON DAY:   There's obviously room for improvement.   There's room for improvement.   I feel like I hit it well enough to contend this week and just didn't capitalize on the greens.   The greens were very tricky and, obviously, just didn't putt very well. 

Q.   All things considered, it's still a reasonable week, since you haven't played for so long and not even a stroke play event since a long time. 
JASON DAY:   Yeah, it's just a good solid week to start off.   Obviously, it was a tough one to come back to, but, no, it's positive stuff going into next week's tournament as well. 
So I think that I did a lot of good things this week, I just got to look at what needs to be improved for next year and then go on from there.   It's playing tough for everyone out there.   I felt like I hit the ball great, but just, like I said, I didn't putt too well. 

Q.   Some people call it a changing of the guard with so many young golfers coming into this tournament this year and you being at the top of them.   What do you think about the younger generation and kind of taking over this year?
JASON DAY:   I think that it's in a good spot, golf is in a good spot right now.   Obviously you can look at Jordan Spieth who is playing so great right now.   Rory, obviously leading that way with the younger guys, former No. 1, and obviously trending in the right direction with how he's playing as well. 
But like you said, there's kind of a changing of the guard.   The older guys are not moving away, they're still playing great golf, but it seems like the younger guys are stepping up a lot more and playing great golf. 

Q.   Given usually that your putting is an absolute strength, how frustrating is it?   Do you feel like you could turn it around with a little more practice?   What is it?
JASON DAY:   No, the last two days wasn't too bad, I putted actually pretty good.   The first two days kind of let me down.   I obviously still had a 3‑putt here in the final round, but, you know what, I just have to keep working hard. 
Something like this week was a good thing for me.   Just to come out and play and get the competitive juices going again and really see what needs to improve, needs to be improved.
It just seems like I just need a little bit more hard work on the putting, short game, and should be good to go.

Q.   Even without the tree on the 17th, just struggling on the greens, do you think it was the pin positions?
JASON DAY:   Well, today that's a pretty tough one.   You get yourself just left of the pin, it's pretty quick going down hill.   So, no, I felt like I hit actually a really good one in there to about 12 feet and felt like I just barely touched it and it still got past the hole.   So in an hour, hour and a half or so, it's definitely going to be very, very quick. 

Q.   When you look back on this week, is it going to be sort of a frustrating week or does that mean that you've had a rough build‑up?
JASON DAY:   I feel a little disappointing is just the way I putted is probably more disappointing.   I think the biggest thing is to not look at it as frustrating, like being frustrated or disappointed, but what can I learn from it.   Because the only way to get better is just really learn from the experience of this week and not really think about it too much and go on from there.

Q.   More relating back, obviously, to the injuries. 
JASON DAY:   Well, you can't do anything about the thumb and all that other stuff, but obviously it's frustrating for me to not be able to kind of have some more competitive rounds under my belt before Augusta.   But it is what it is.   Some guys are hurt more than me and they can't play right now.   So I'm a happy guy, I'm playing right now and everything feels good.

Q.   Are you already thinking ahead to the U.S. Open?
JASON DAY:   You know what, I'm just, right now I'm just glad I got 72 holes in and I can play golf again.   I'm not really worried about the thumb, it felt good out there today. 
I'm playing next week and it's a good little course for me, I think.   Obviously it takes away driver. 
But definitely looking forward to the U.S. Open.   I went out there a couple years ago, just to see how the course is out there and I played nine holes.   The course looks great. 
So we'll see how it goes.   It's obviously difficult, different kind of grass.   It's that kind of Bermuda kind of grass, it obviously plays very difficult.   So, once again, I'm going to have to probably get in there pretty early and kind of feel around with some wedges and make sure that I get used to the grass there.   But I'm not looking too far forward.
