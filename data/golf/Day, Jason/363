Q.   Pretty amazing shot by Cabrera?
JASON DAY:   Yeah, obviously with Adam birdieing the last hole he needed to hit a good shot in there, and obviously that's setting himself up for a good chance of getting into a playoff.

Q.   You've come awfully close once again, struggled at 16 and 17.   Take us through the issues there. 
JASON DAY:   I mean, I came off a 3‑wood hole before that, so birdieing 13, 14 and 15 was really nice, and unfortunately bogeying 16 and 17 was obviously what I wanted to do.   You know, it was really tough.   Obviously I think pressure got to me a little bit, and unfortunately I bogeyed those‑‑ well, 16 and 17 and had a really good shot at birdieing 18, but very happy for Adam right now.   I hope he follows through and wins the thing.
