Q. You just couldn't quite get it going out there today. 
JASON DAY: Actually, you know what ‑‑ yeah, I mean on the par‑5s I couldn't get it going. I played the par‑5s 2‑over today, so that's obviously thoroughly disappointing with how things were going after the first two days. And unfortunately, yeah, I had it to 2‑under I was thinking, okay, if I can birdie 13‑‑ I ended up birdieing 12 and 14. Instead of birdieing the par‑5 I ended up ‑‑ from over the back ‑‑ I ended up parring that. That probably would have taken me to 10 if I could have at least had those three string of birdies.
And then I just was out of position all day with my driver. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it on the fairways and get myself back into position to give myself a legitimate chance to make a birdie, especially on the par‑5s. 
So a little disappointing with how things ended, but I think the wind is going to be up a little bit, hopefully, tomorrow and that gives us a little bit of a chance. But obviously yeah it's disappointing to finish the way I did. 

Q. Can you come here tomorrow with a plan for all‑out attack or is it too fine a line or you've got no choice?
JASON DAY: It just depends on what kind of weather we get. If there's weather overnight and it softens up the course then you can definitely be a little more aggressive. 
But there's just a fine line because some of these pin locations if you miss it in the wrong spots you're going backwards anyway. So sometimes it's easier to hole a 20‑footer than try and sneak something in there very close. 
I just got to play the par‑5s good tomorrow and kind of snag 1‑ or 2‑under on the par‑4s and hopefully birdie one of the par‑3s. If I can do that then I at least give myself a chance of trying to win the Tournament. 
It's just, like I said, today was just try and get your self into contention, I felt like I was managing it. Although I didn't have my best stuff, I felt like I was managing it pretty well until 15 and obviously I hit one in the water there and you just can't do that there, especially to that pin. 
So, yeah, I mean it is what it is, I just got to come out and try and be better tomorrow.
