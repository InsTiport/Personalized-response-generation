JASON DAY: Played good today.  Drove it very nicely and hit a lot of good iron shots.  I just didn't capitalize on the opportunities that I had out there and it's not disappointing.  It is what it is.  I haven't had the greatest -- I guess I haven't had the greatest putting display over the last three weeks that I've played.  I think that shows a little bit in the results.  But for the most part, I feel pretty good about where my head is at and looking forward to the next three days.  Hopefully we can skirt the weather and be able to get this thing in.
Q. (No microphone)?
JASON DAY: Yeah, granted, obviously the scoring conditions were pretty good this morning.  The greens were very receptive.  Obviously over the afternoon it's going to get hotter and make it a little bit tougher for the guys in the afternoon.
I'm pretty pleased.  I'm very excited about how I hit it today.  I hit a lot of good quality shots.  Hasn't been like that lately.  To be able to go out there and hit it exactly where I'm going and see the shot and what I need to do and actually execute it was exciting for me.  Really positive stuff going into the next three rounds.
Got to do a little bit of putting trying to straighten out a few of the little ones.  Try to change that focus from standing over the ball and thinking about what am I doing rather than get in there and try to hole the putt.
Q. (No microphone) did it maker tougher or were you pretty pleased?
JASON DAY: I'm pretty pleased, to be honest.  It's -- I think if I came out, you could be -- by Thursday, if you practice Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you could be pretty tired with how hot it was.  It was in the mid to high 90s.  You can get pretty drained pretty quickly.  I'm glad I took Monday, Tuesday off, even though I'm a little bit under the weather.  It was kind of a blessing really to come out yesterday, play 18 holes real quick and then get out of here.
Q. (No microphone)?
JASON DAY: Not really.  It's that's part of having a family, right.  Things aren't going to be perfect all the time.  I enjoy having my family on the road.  It's not the first time that the kids and myself and Ellie have been sick.  It's not going to be the last time.  It's speed bumps that you have got to try and slow down and get around.  Come out and execute.
Q. Would you describe your game plan as conservative this week?
JASON DAY: Yeah, yeah.  Well, it depends on what the weather is doing.  Obviously if we get the weather tomorrow then that will change it because everything will soften up.  I'm able to get away with more 3 woods and 3 irons.  Down 18, I hit 3-iron, 3-iron.  If hit it a little bit further left, it would have been middle of green, perfect.  Whereas you don't really need to take that -- if you don't need to take it on, you don't need to.  Hit driver, hit it left it's in the water.  You hit it way right, it's in the bunker, you are going to lay-up anyway.  So if I can get iron in my hand, get it down the middle, give myself an opportunity, that's a main goal.
It's probably a little bit more conservative than I usually am, just only because in major championships, I don't feel like the lead -- any given week on the PGA Tour, there's usually a guy, especially if the course is set up, there's a guy that gets to 7- or 8-under.  I think with a major championship, you have got to be patient, take your opportunities when you can and work yourself up to the lead come Sunday.  If you get off to a great start, great.  If not, kind of chip away at it.
Q. (No microphone)?
JASON DAY: Yeah, obviously I think -- I don't think Rory made a birdie today.  He actually hit it okay, he just didn't hole anything on the greens.  Phil had a tough trod on the front side and fought back very nicely on the back side.  That momentum kind of helped on the back side.
I feel like I was just trying to stay in my own world.  I can't really control what those guys are going to do.  Sometimes it does zap the energy out of the group when a couple of the guys aren't playing well.  You have got to get in your own world and stay there and focus on what you need to do.
Q. What it's like to (no microphone)?
JASON DAY: To be honest, I went to the Champions Dinner, that was exciting.  I don't want that to be the last one that I have.  It was pretty special to be able to go through that and have Ellie there.  I haven't been out on the golf course too much to soak it in.  The New Jersey fans are fantastic.  But once again, I'm here to do a job and try and win the tournament.  Yeah, I mean, I feel pretty good about it I'm not looking at it as defending.
Q. You mentioned the battle for world No. 1 (no microphone)?
JASON DAY: I know that the only way to stay at No. 1 or to get to No. 1 is win tournaments, finish well in big tournaments.  If I can keep focusing on the process, all the hard work that I've done before to get to this point, that's where I need to keep my focus at.  You have finishes that you don't like and you just got to keep plugging along, keep moving forward try to win as much as I can.  I've always said that winning takes care of everything.
