 Q.   Jason, really a fine round of golf.   I was really impressed that you were able to bounce back from a couple of lost strokes out there with a double bogey and bogey, and you were still able to finish strong?  
JASON DAY:   Yeah, those were really terrible shots if you look at them.   I mean, they're way off target.   Unfortunately, hitting two balls in the water on the second hole was obviously not what I had in the plans, but it was good to bounce back.   I knew after those holes that there was going to be a lot of opportunities coming in.   So I just needed to (Indiscernible).  
   
 Q.   You waited on the tee at 6 (No Microphone).   Did you adjust ball position, grip, alignment?   And then Jason went to the side and said would you quit being such an idiot and kind of chastised yourself and moved on?  
JASON DAY:   Yeah, it's just sometimes I get in my own way.   Sometimes I get to the ball and I should back away when I'm not feeling ready.   Sometimes you've just got to give yourself a little bit of a pump up.   I worked out today, so good position going into the next three days.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
JASON DAY:   It's going good.   Hopefully the weather tomorrow will be good.   It will be good to see the golf course dry out, and obviously when the weather comes in, it's no fun for anyone.   There is a lot of waiting around.   I'm just looking forward to the next three days and the golf course is playing very nicely.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone).  
JASON DAY:   I'm in Columbus, Ohio now, so my blood has changed.   I'm used to the cold weather.  
   
 Q.   So did you feel good about today?   
JASON DAY:   Yeah, it was good.   I got off to a fantastic start with the front nine.   Couple shots that I wish I could take back with two balls in the water on the second hole, but it happens.   You know, thinking about it, it's just way off target.   Nowhere near where I wanted to go.   It's unfortunate and disappointing, but it just happens sometimes that it works that way.   
But I'm glad I kind of gave myself a kick in the butt and came up strong with three birdies.  
   
 Q.   Talk about that.   After those two holes there on three and four, double bogey, bogey, bouncing back.   Just the mindset there, what do you say to yourself?   
JASON DAY:   You know, that there are plenty of holes.   Because it's easy to take yourself out of a tournament Thursday rather than keep yourself in it.   I just said there are plenty of opportunities.   I played the Pro‑Am yesterday, and it's always good to play the Pro‑Am just to see how the course is the day before.   It felt good.   The course is very receptive.   Still a little wet out there, but the PGA TOUR does a fantastic job giving us preferred lies out there with the incoming weather, so we have a lot of good lies out there and the course is very gettable.   So after those mishaps, I definitely thought I could get something.
