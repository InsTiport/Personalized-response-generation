Q. Your first FedEx win, how does that sound?
JASON DAY: That's great.  I'm really going to try and make this push for the FedExCup.  It's been a good summer for me.  I never expected to come out and play the way I did today.  Just very patient with myself.
It's been an amazing year for me.  Just the work and dedication I've put in over the years, it feels like it's finally paying off.  It's been a whirlwind kind of summer.
Q. What about the PGA?  Must be so difficult to come to a big championship like this and win once more after your first major.  Describe that.
JASON DAY: It feels good.  Never really got the chance to sit down last week and kind of, you know, go through what happened at the PGA.  To be able to come here and finish the way I did, I never really had the opportunity to finish that way and lead by that much coming in.
But it's a lot easier coming down the stretch in a major championship, I can tell you that.  I don't know what to say.  This week has been fantastic.
Q. Looking forward, with a little help by Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, in the next few weeks you can get to the pinnacle of the game, No. 1.  Is that on your mind?
JASON DAY: Right now, no.  It always is a goal of mine.  I can only control what I can control.  I can't control them.  Seeing Jordan and Rory are going to play next week, they'll most likely play well.  That means I'll have to play well, as well, just keep this momentum going.
