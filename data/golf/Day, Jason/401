 Q. What a nice opening round and what a nice birdie on your final hole, too. 
 JASON DAY: Yeah, you know, my game felt pretty good coming into this week. I had a good couple days off, obviously, after New Jersey got shortened. I got to go back to Ohio and just relax in some nice weather. I got in on Tuesday, did some good preparation, and came out today and hit the ball pretty good. I was very happy with how I played, and obviously good to finish off with a birdie, too. 

 Q. 14 greens, 28 putts. Tell me about the approach. I had you at 144 into the 9th. Used a little creativity there, landed it short of the green and rolled it up?
 JASON DAY: Yeah, it's funny, the greens have been bouncing five to seven paces. I knew it was going to be pretty tough if I landed that near the pin to kind of stop it somewhere close to it. So I just tried to land it just about three or four paces just short of the green, kind of run it up there and try and use that slope. It's funny, there's kind of like a ridge that runs across the right-hand side of that -- obviously just right of the pin, and if you just get on the left of it, you're pretty close, but I just got on the right of it and rolled a really nice putt down the hill.

 Q. 15th in the FedExCup standings. You've got to have your mind on $10 million. 
 JASON DAY: Right now just trying to focus on what I need to do. If it happens, it happens. Obviously I think $10 million is on everyone's mind that if you have a shot at winning the $10 million you're thinking about it. I'm not going to lie, I've thought about it a couple times and just looking forward to obviously coming back and playing tomorrow.
