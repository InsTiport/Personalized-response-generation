Q. Describe the way you feel right now.
JASON DAY: It's not too bad.  Yesterday it was definitely sore.  I had a pull.  It's a disk, when it gets inflamed the facet joints lock up, and then everything kind of goes into spasm and I can't really move.  And it's really difficult to play golf.
I did a lot of therapy yesterday and made sure I did prophyls every hour and felt pretty good.  I felt pretty good last night.  And came out today not really knowing if I was going to play or not.  I warmed up very nicely on the range and decided to give it a shot.  And I stretched pretty much on every hole.
Q. Jason, yesterday when we saw you after your victory on 16, you didn't know if you were going to play today.  You not only played, you have blown Thongchai Jaidee off the map, what was it, an eagle and five or six birdies?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I didn't really know if I was going to obviously play today.  It was kind of up in the air how I felt.  It's the same old things that usually happens to me when my back locks up like that, the facet joints, everything gets inflamed, the facet joints lock up and I can't really swing.  I got some good therapy last night.  And then doing my prophyls every hour and slept pretty good.  I woke up and I'm on a Dose Pack right now, which is the steroid to try to get the inflammation out.  A little pain, but for the most part pretty good.  I came out during the first hole and that was pretty good there.
Q. You set the tone for the day.  The way you played today was that the better you played at any stage last week?
JASON DAY: You know, it's pretty close to how I played second round of Bay Hill.  But today I drove it nice and hit a lot of good quality shots on the green and definitely saved myself when I needed to with the putts on the green.  But very, very happy.  I've got one more round until I get into the weekend.
