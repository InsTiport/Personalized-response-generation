 Q.   You've sent home the reining Masters champion.   How well did you play today?  
JASON DAY:   Yeah, it was just really steady golf.   Bubba gave me a couple early on and I just tried to hold that lead, and I tried to extend it.   I think I was 4‑under through 14 holes, so overall very, very happy with how I played.   Like I said before, it was just steady.  
   
 Q.   Graeme McDowell this afternoon, quite a competitor in match play.   Thoughts on that one?  
JASON DAY:   It's going to be tough.   I was just telling someone before I found out, if I have to play G‑Mac it's going to be mentally and physically tough.   I have to try and get back into the right frame of mind before I head back out to the course.   I know that we have a short stint before we head back out.
