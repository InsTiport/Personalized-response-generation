 Q. Overall how do you feel about your round today?
 JASON DAY: Very happy. The wind was very strong out there today, very, very strong. And by at least two or three clubs more. And I'm just happy with the way I am right now, I'm even par and hopefully I can get a couple back over the next few holes and try to put myself in position for the weekend.
