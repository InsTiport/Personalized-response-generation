 Q.  First of all, how are you feeling, how's the back?  
JASON DAY: It was a little tight this morning, with the cold weather.  But hopefully it warms up this afternoon.   
It feels good.  I hit it nice today, gave myself opportunities.   
 Q.  How is your game now compared to what it was when you were coming into the event?  
JASON DAY: You know what, I'm giving it a hundred percent every day.  And that's all I can ask for.   
I mean as far as coming off last week, I feel like it's right there.  If I can keep doing what I've been doing and giving myself chances I feel like I'll be going all the way through to Sunday.  Right now I've got another 18 to go.   
 Q.  That was another brilliant performance, 4-under, 4 birdies, an eagle.  
JASON DAY: It was good.  I played solid.  Like you said, had a couple sloppy bogeys, 13 and 15.  And you take those holes out I played great.   
I've got Brooks in the afternoon, that's going to be interesting.  We're both pretty long.  He seems to be playing really good golf, so it's going to be a tough one.   
 Q.  Your back was the focus after Day 1.  
JASON DAY: Yeah, it was a little tight this morning getting up.  Hopefully it can heat up and I can get the back a little loosened up.  I know that we're teeing off at 12:40, so it's coming up in a bit.  Get some therapy real quick and get back out.   
 Q.  Is there any concern knowing you've got to play 36 holes Saturday, 36 holes Sunday?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, you can definitely start thinking about it, and going, that's a lot of golf for my back.  Especially going at it, you're playing against the guy next to you, so you've got that extra little bit of adrenaline going through you, and you try to rip at it every hole.  Unfortunately sometimes it gets a little tough.  I'm trying to focus on trying to get through the day and see how it goes.
