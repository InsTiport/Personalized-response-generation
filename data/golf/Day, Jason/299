  b>Q. I call Torrey Pines South the A mental game.  It doesn't matter about your golf game if your head's not this in it.  I know it was a struggle early and you hung in there and good things happened late.JASON DAY: Yeah, gosh, you know, it was tough, it was a tough day.  Especially on the front nine. Didn't help to go along with hitting a looked like 10 year old boy in the head and he was bleeding pretty bad.  So I felt really, really bad about that.  I said to myself, you know what, at the time I just said, you can't quit now, you got to keep pushing forward, because even though that kind of rattled me a little bit, I just needed to finish strong and luckily enough I hit a great shot into 17 and I holed that shot out.  So to get it 1-under today, 7-under total, one more day to go, see how it goes.Q. We have all done it, I hit a lady at L.A. I'll never forget it.  It was a beautiful bouquet that we sent her.  Maybe you can get him a little Play Station or something.JASON DAY: Well, you know, I want to make sure that I get his details and hopefully send him something.  Just all the stuff that he needs.  I just felt really, really, really bad about it.  Obviously, we're not trying to hit it in the rough and we did call fore and just unfortunate it hit a 10 year old kid.Q. Go out there and have fun.  It's a little weird for you to be this way.  It's hurting you I can see it?JASON DAY: Yeah, it is.  I think about my son and it's tough, but got one more day left and get a good sleep in tonight and go out and try to win it tomorrow.Q. Battling your first 12 holes, 2-over par, your final six holes were 3-under par, highlighted by that eagle on 17.  How critical was the last third of your round to get you into this tournament?JASON DAY: You know what, it's just, it's a lot of a patience game out there.  Especially with how this course is, how tough it is around here now.  It feels like a U.S. Open.  Once again, I was playing a little average during the start of my round and then it helped a lot with hitting that second shot on to the par-5 and birdieing that hole, getting things kind of moving in my direction. Then obviously I hit the little kid out there today and that rattled me around a little bit and kind of just -- I didn't want to finish the way I thought I was going to finish.  So instead of kind of running away from it, you just run towards it and got lucky with a great shot into 17 and finished with an eagle there and a 1-under total today wasn't too bad with how I was playing at the start of the round.Q. A lot of players out here on the PGA TOUR, including your self as you say, you got to be patient.  For those sitting on the couch, what does that mean out there?JASON DAY: Oh, you could -- if you're not hitting fairways, the rough is so brutal that where the pins are tucked, you go to the hit it to 30, 40 feet.  If you miss a lot of fairways and you're hitting it to 30, 40 feet, it's very difficult to hole those putts.  So, it's just about just getting it on the green, maybe snagging a long putt here or there, and really trying to capitalize on the good drives off the tee which give you the shorter club in and an opportunity to get at the flags.  Because the pins are very difficult today.  The greens are very firm and fast.  So with a wedge they're still bouncing a good five to 10 yards.  So, it's very difficult.  It's a fun challenge.Q. You are going to be chasing the lead on Sunday, does that make it more difficult to be patient?JASON DAY: It's so tough because things out here can change in a heart beat.  I was 1-over par standing in the middle of the 17th fairway and I walk off that hole 1-under par.  So, it's going to be an exciting round tomorrow, not only for myself but for the guys that are trying to chase the lead.  I'm only two shots back, currently, and hopefully I can keep it going and we'll see how it goes.Q. A real battling round but you come out of it under par and left yourself in a good position without your best stuff.JASON DAY: Yeah, I just was driving it very poorly at the start of my round and kind of found something where I was just thinking, I was leaking a few right, in the back of my mind I just didn't know if my ball position was back in my stance, so I just kind of put it up a little bit further in my stance on the back side and started driving the ball wonderfully. I got something going in the last six holes, which was good, because it's very difficult to try and take, to shoot a really low score out here.  You got to be driving it well, got to be hitting your iron shots on point and then you got to be putting well.  This is a U.S. Open course and it kind of feels like that right now.  It's tough to have any opportunities on the greens if you're not driving it well.Q. How proud of yourself are you the way you rebounded after hitting the young kid?  That's a tough thing to go through for anybody.  But you responded very well.JASON DAY: Yeah, it was tough because I just obviously sitting there thinking about, is the kid all right and the poor little fella, you know, he was -- it's just hard.  Because we're not trying to hit it in the rough and that, and I felt I got rattled a little bit after that and I just, I didn't know what to say.  Obviously, it's tough when you hit someone, but for it to be a 10 year old kid and him to have a bleeding head and that, it's very difficult to see, but I just said to myself, just kind of do it for him, because I didn't want to finish poorly.  To hole the shot on 17, that was obviously a great boost to get back under par and get in 1-under.Q. How critical do you think that eagle is for you going forward into tomorrow?JASON DAY: Well, I just, it's good momentum obviously going into tomorrow's round and I'm glad that I found something with my swing late in the round. Once again, it's going to be a tough day out there, because we're going to have similar weather to what we had today and the green speeds and the firmness of the greens, are obviously going to be very fast and hard and obviously you're not looking to have a lot of low scores out there tomorrow, so it's kind of a -- you got to be patient and kind of grind it out, that kind of a day.  So that's kind of the stuff that I like.
