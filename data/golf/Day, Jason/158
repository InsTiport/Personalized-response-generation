Q. Obviously a difficult finish.  Give us some thoughts on your round.
JASON DAY: I played pretty good up until obviously the putt on 15.  I hit it a little bit hard through the break and that obviously cost me a bogey there.  16 is always a tough par-5 anyways if you don't get a good drive there.  It's really tough to get any sort of wedge in your hand and kind of made a mess of it.  I was just sitting there really thinking about -- especially on my third shot, I tried to hit it just left of the green.  You can't hit it -- if you're trying to hit a low punch cut around the corner, that's what I was trying to go for, and I hit a good shot, I just didn't hit it hard enough.  If I hit it long and left into the trees, then it's a difficult up-and-down, and it obviously brings out of bounds into play, too.
But yeah, to be honest, I played pretty good golf up until 16.  I really had two bad holes.  I mean, I had a couple bogeys, but really kind of one hole that derailed me, which was 16.
Yeah, I mean, it's obviously disappointing to not get the win here, but I feel like it's coming around nicely.  I'm playing some pretty good golf.  Played good golf after the opening round at the U.S. Open, came home pretty strong, and this week I've played pretty solid.  But obviously my goal is to try and win.  Every time I tee it up, I'm trying to win a golf tournament, and unfortunately just fell a little bit short.
Disappointed, but I've got to try and focus on what I did great this week, move on, and try and get better for the next one.
Q. How close did you get that third shot to the green, and was there any thought of just laying back 80 yards?
JASON DAY: Well, you lay back 80 yards, it's going to bounce through anyways.  It's really difficult.  You have to lay up perfect to a perfect number to get any sort of spin.  If you lay up too far, then you're coming in with kind of a half shot, and it's really hard to judge how much it's going to bounce when you're hitting a low punch on out of the rough.  You just don't know how far it's going to roll.
You know, that would have put me back, even if I didn't get up-and-down, it would have put me back maybe one.  It's no easy finish.  You've got an opportunity of birdieing 17, and 18 is obviously always a tough finish.
I thought I had the right play.  I think I was just trying to hit it up there, the left, get it just left of the bunker or just in the bunker there.  If I could do that, hole the putt or get up-and-down, and try and make a birdie coming home.  Sometimes you take those risks and it doesn't pay off.  So it happens, but I'm looking forward to the Open.
Q. I know you were missing fairways.  Was it a driver on 16 or did you --
JASON DAY: I hit 3-wood.
Q. Any consistent thing with missing the fairways in the back nine?
JASON DAY: Consistent?
Q. Did you see any consistent problem?
JASON DAY: Misses?
Q. Yeah, with the misses of the fairways.
JASON DAY: I'm trying to think.  I really didn't miss too many fairways on the back side other than --
Q. They said you missed your last six.
JASON DAY: Yeah, well, I mean, it was just -- it's just first cut.
Q. Will this motivate you going forward?  Will this be a motivating thing to go forward to Troon?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I think so.  You know, I'm looking forward to taking the first part of this week off and trying to get some practice in, trying to get some reps in.  Yeah, I think -- I've never seen Troon before, so I'm hoping when I get over there, I'll play Saturday, play Sunday, it suits my eye, and then I can play well around there because I think I'm really trending in the right direction here.  Been playing some good golf, and you can't win all of them.  Unfortunately you can't do that.  It's very hard to do that, and that's why we play this game.  All positive things.
Q. How aware were you that Dustin was charging?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I looked.  I saw he was 6-under through 14, and then he birdied 17 because you could hear the roar, and then 18, after the par-5, I watched him hit, and I think he was left or something like that.  He played good golf on the weekend.  You can't really do nothing but congratulate him because he played tremendous golf on the weekend.  Unfortunately I didn't do the best I could to try and beat him.
