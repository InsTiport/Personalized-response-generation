Q. How special is this?  You've got your family around you as you celebrate yet another match play title, and a second win in consecutive weeks.  You're on a roll, aren't you?
JASON DAY: It feels great to do this.  And, yeah, I just kept on rolling from last week.  And even with a sore back this week, obviously it gradually got better and better, but I'm just really, really pleased with how I played.
Q. I see the emotion in you now, and I understand this is very important to you.  You're living life dreams, and how hard you fought back on Wednesday.  Talk about how your back affected you the rest of the week, even though the scoreboard it looked like it?
JASON DAY: It's really tough.  A lot of people don't realize that I'm -- I get here two or three hours before my tee time, try and get therapy and I'm there like another hour after my rounds trying to get therapy and I'm in between rounds trying to get therapy.  It was a little tight later on in the week, but for the most part it really didn't affect me too much over the weekend.
Q. Take us through the performance in the final round.  The sloppy start with the bogey, but you had another six birdies through 14 holes.
JASON DAY: I really enjoy this golf course.  It was such a pleasure to play here.  I've never been here before.  And I've thoroughly enjoyed Austin.  But just set up so beautifully, it didn't matter where the wind was coming, because we had southerly and northerly winds.  And when you have the short game on, especially around here, you can definitely go low.  I've been working very hard on that short game and on the greens I just felt like I could hole anything.
Q. Put your mind forward, everyone was looking at you as a contender.  How confident are you feeling going towards the Masters?
JASON DAY: I feel good.  But once again, I can't get complacent with how I'm playing right now.  I can't focus on -- it would be great to win Augusta.  But I've got to make sure I get in and do the little things that count towards the big picture and that's my prep in getting ready for that week.  Rest and recovery next week is huge for me, because it has been a long week and a long two weeks.  But get down there Thursday and try and do the same old things, and hopefully pull out a win.
