Q. That was one of those famous fight-backs of yours, you really charged home to give yourself a chance going into the weekend.  Take us through that round.
JASON  DAY: Yeah, got it to 3-over pretty quick, especially after three holes.  You know, kind of frustrating, really, because it was like two different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  The unforced errors that I have been doing this year happened all on the front side, and then the unbelievable play on the back side, it's been mixed in.
You know, I look at the front side to the back side and I'm like, I mean, I absolutely look like an absolute chopper on the front side and on the back side I looked like one of the best players in the world.  I'm sitting there scratching my head because I wish I could just pinpoint it, but obviously just making some silly errors and unforced errors out there.
But the good thing about it is this course is actually quite difficult in regards that the scores, you know, it's only 6-under right now.  So two more days.
Q. And that's it, six back going into the weekend in any tournament, plenty of time and room.
JASON  DAY: That's the thing.  I think it gave me a lot of hope on the back side the way I played, knowing that I could play some really good golf.
It's actually quite positive to see that, even though I am six back going into the weekend.  But once again, I think if I can just slowly inch my way up and give myself into contention, hopefully I can start playing like I did on the back side today over the next two days.  It's there; I need to piece it together.
