 Q.  Saturday's moving day, you did a little moving today.  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I needed to.  The first two days were a little bit of a struggle for me.  It wasn't too bad the first day, I actually played half decent, just didn't hole anything.  Yesterday I just struggled on the front side and then came home strong to get inside the cut line, which was nice.  But get out early today before the wind kind of picks up -- it's starting to pick up now as you can see -- and I think 5-under today was good.  It's a good step in the right direction.  So another one tomorrow, you never know, if I can get something low I might give myself a shot at winning, depending on how the guys go.   
 Q.  You commented on the wind and the course.  Do you see the scores getting away this afternoon?  I think not.  Your thoughts?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I mean -- well the greens are getting -- they have got a little bit quicker over the last few days and the pin locations aren't too easy.  And if the breeze gets up -- I think it's supposed to get around nine or 10 miles an hour -- on a hard, firm course like this, when the fairways are rolling out, it's hard to hit the fairways with some wind.  And then from there, if you can't get in the fairway it's really difficult to hit the green.  So it was a premium on hitting fairways today.  If you can do that, give yourself the opportunities, I made life a little easier.  But once again, I was lucky enough to get out early and get the birdies when they came.
