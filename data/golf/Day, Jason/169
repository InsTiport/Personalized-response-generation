Q. Tough finish but still in contention.
JASON DAY: It was just a little bit unlucky on the lie, I think.  It shouldn't have stayed there in the first place, halfway up the hill.  It's already soft underneath it with a pitch mark behind.  Just hit a little bit fat with the chip, trying to make sure that I got underneath it to put a little spin on it, and then just obviously clipped a bit of the pitch mark that was already up.
If I -- I mean, at the start of the day, they said you're going to shoot a 68, I would have taken it, definitely.  I think I played pretty good.  I hit a lot better than I did yesterday, and there's a lot of positives going into tomorrow.
I did close the gap on that lead a little bit too, so that's a positive.  And I'm pretty sure we're going to have some tough conditions tomorrow.  If I can play some good golf tomorrow, that could shoot me back into contention and hopefully win the tournament.
Q. (No microphone)?
JASON DAY: No, definitely.  I hit a lot of good quality shots out there and gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Just missed the one on 17.  That surprised me that didn't break that much.  And then obviously the little mishap on 2 and 18.  But, I mean, it can happen.
I've still got one more day to go.  There's a lot of golf to be played tomorrow.  So hopefully, I can stay patient enough, try and see if I can give myself the opportunities again tomorrow and see how it goes.
Q. (Inaudible) do you have any idea what kind of numbers will win?
JASON DAY: I have no idea yet.  We'll see.  If it stays 14, usually, you don't have to -- especially around this kind of golf course, if the conditions are up or it's hard, you don't have to do too much.  Just be patient with yourself.  The par 5s are usually the ones that yield the birdies, and then if you can kind of get your way through some of the tougher holes, yeah.  But I won't know until the rest of the guys finish and see what I need to do.
Q. I was just going to ask, two tournaments, two golf courses in a row where you really have seemed determined to turn around your fortunes.  You had great success at THE PLAYERS, same with here, and now you're sort of doing it again.  What do you think it is?  Just will yourself to it?
JASON DAY: I'm just trying to prove myself that I can play around golf courses that I haven't typically played well in the past.  That's what I'm going to try and go with into tomorrow's round with that mentality that I can do it.  Hopefully, that's enough.
But once again, there's a lot of great golfers out there right now that are playing some good golf that are going to be tough to beat.  So we'll see how it goes.
I mean, I've won Bay Hill, and I didn't play good there.  I won PLAYERS, and I didn't play good there.  So hopefully, I can make it a trio and win this one tomorrow.  Thanks.  Cheers.
