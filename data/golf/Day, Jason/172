 Q.  Jason, how would you describe your week here?  You had high hopes you'd change your fortunes here.  
JASON DAY: It wasn't too bad.  I mean, it was the first round and the third round were nice.  And then second round was okay, didn't hit it that great.   
And then today was just all over the shop with regards to just wasn't that sharp out there.  Missing greens with wedges in the hand.  Just wasn't as sharp as I would have liked to have been.  Yeah, it is what it is.  You can't win them all.   
 Q.  Was the wind a struggle for you?  
JASON DAY: No.  It was fine.  I was going all right the whole front nine.  Went to the back -- well, I bogeyed 9.  That set off a run of 5s there that I didn't want.  And hit in the water twice today.  Just can't do that when you're trying to win a tournament.   
 Q.  Obviously, there are some positives (No microphone).  
JASON DAY: Yeah, it would have been nice to compete and play well here and get in contention, which for the most part I did, just didn't have a good Sunday.  But, you know, it's over now.   
I've got to start prepping for the U.S. Open obviously.  That's a big one that's coming up.  Try and get some rest, recovery this coming week the best I can.  I get there Friday, play 18 holes, and try and just slowly work my way around the golf course over the weekend and see how it goes.   
I've just got to tidy a few things up with the long game.  It's not that bad because, like I said, Thursday and Saturday, I hit it great.  I hit it off the tee was great.  Into the greens were fantastic.  Friday and today, it just wasn't sharp.  It is what it is.   
 Q.  So maybe one good range session away from getting back?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I think -- I just kept on leaking.  Like I don't like hitting cuts, and I just had that all week, especially with my longer stuff, my irons, my drivers, my woods.  I like hitting kind of big draws.  I couldn't stand up here and aim right and hit this big sweeping draw if I needed to, and I just kept standing straight and cutting off and really couldn't get anything going once that happened.   
Once you start missing fairways, it's tough to really try and make any score.   
 Q.  When you've had the success you've had obviously the last several months, are you able to shake off the final ten holes, like today, like easier maybe than you did a few years ago even?  
JASON DAY: Oh, yeah.  It's -- I mean, everyone was asking earlier this year when I wasn't winning, and I just said it's a process.  It's the same thing.  I've got to keep working hard because as long as -- I prepped for ten days coming into this tournament.  Usually I only prep for four or five days.  I do practice a lot, but come to go this event, I usually prep four or five days, but I kind of doubled that this time.   
You know what, I think, if it doesn't show up here this week, it's going to show up somewhere else.  As long as I just keep working hard, it's going to happen again.  I've just got to focus on getting the process right, and if I can do that, then hopefully the U.S. Open will time perfectly, and I can peak there and play well there.
