 Q.  Just thoughts on the week and what you take away from this week, from your two days playing with Adam?  
JASON DAY: It was good.  Just unfortunate that we bogeyed 16 and 17 today.  It was just kind of like a -- yeah, it was hard.  I mean, there's no excuses.  We did have the tougher side of the draw, but there's no excuses.  We just needed to come out and play well, and unfortunately I think we just didn't have the momentum going.   
 Q.  What's it like going back to Wells Fargo?  I know you've had a lot of success there.  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I'm going to go see family.  I'm going to go back up to Ohio, and then I'll head back down probably Sunday night or Monday, something like that maybe, and get into it.  I'm looking forward to going back to a golf course that I just really enjoy and have had a lot of success on, so we'll see how it goes.   
 Q.  Just thoughts on playing with Jason this week?  Obviously disappointed to miss the cut, but just takeaways from the week?  
ADAM SCOTT: Look, I think there's a positive for me to take away that I'm hitting the ball still very well, and ultimately the foursomes format can be tough.  I think a couple of extra missed greens from both Jason and I in that format made it -- made a couple bogeys appear that maybe shouldn't have because we weren't really out of position, but we missed greens from the fairway and then our short games were under pressure.  It's tough to get the rhythm going, and we were grinding hard and didn't quite get it going.  It wasn't anything horrible, and then ultimately under pressure coming down the last few.
