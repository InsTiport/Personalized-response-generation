 Q.  How would you round up your season?  
JASON DAY: I would say below average. Very disappointing that I didn't make the Tour Championship but it happens. Looking forward to taking some time off, though.   
 Q.  I'm sure you expect to be at the Presidents Cup. How are you going to work on your game?  
JASON DAY: It's such a long way away, I'm not really thinking about it, to be honest right now. I just need to contend of get some rest and focus on Korea and Japan, that's more -- that's more what I'm trying to worry about right now, those tournaments. If I can play well enough Ernie can pick me on the team.
