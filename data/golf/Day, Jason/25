Q. How do you feel you played today?
JASON DAY: I played okay.  I didn't drive it as well as I should have.  Kind of got myself out of position.  Got a little lucky on 18 to get myself a birdie there at the end.
But, yeah, I'm going to go work on putting.  I hit a lot of good iron shots.  I gave myself a lot of looks.  But just need to tidy up the driver.  You can't miss it where I missed it today.
Q. How did you feel the chemistry went today between you and Stevie?
JASON DAY: We worked very, very hard.  So we've been trying to stay on top of it.  And I feel like things are only going to get better.  I'm out there trying to hit the certain shots that he's calling for, and it seems like it's working pretty nice.  Granted, 60 to 65 degrees right now and not really much wind.  It will be a little tougher once the wind picks up.  But that's going to be tough for everyone, too.
Q. Do you feel like you did enough to keep yourself in it and not be too far back on the first day?
JASON DAY: This is one of those days you feel if you weren't disciplined enough, you could be hitting in the same spot I did but walk off with 1-, 2-, or 3-over par.  But I'm walking off with 1-under par.  I think it's a step in the right direction.  Rickie hit it phenomenally from tee to green.  He missed a few, but that's just how it goes.  There's three more rounds to go.
