Q. Encouraged by the last two days?
JASON DAY: Yeah, definitely encouraged.  The course played very difficult today.  I didn't see the -- I could see the 7-under, if you got yourself in position out of there.  But it's a difficult task because you have to position yourself correctly on the greens.
You take 9, for instance.  I hit my 8-iron -- if it was maybe a yard or so short it would have kind of gone down towards the pin.  And the same with 12.  If it was a yard or so short it would have gone down towards the pin.  And now you're struggling to make par.  You're just out of position -- it's a real razor thin, fine line between shooting a 65 and shooting a 73 here.
Q. How difficult was 16 and 17 playing today?
JASON DAY: It's hard because for some reason 16 always plays shorter than what the actual number is.  And regardless of where the wind is, it always plays shorter.  You'll see a lot of guys over the back.  You've probably seen that already this week.  That green is a lot firmer than the rest of the golf course, as well.  You want to try to take the lower club -- I mean the higher club and try to hit something higher, but then you've got to carry water.  If you don't contact with correctly.  I hit 7-iron and pulled it left and made a bogey.  But Stewart didn't quite catch his 8-iron and it pulled up until the water.  You've got to hit a really good shot.
Q. How ready are you for Erin Hills?
JASON DAY: I feel like I'm really close to putting everything together.  It's coming along.  I feel like I'm starting to see the lines way better on the putting green.  My chipping and touch around the greens and the bunker and the rough and even on the fairways is coming along nicely.  I chipped in three times this week.  The driving is pretty decent.  I've just got to put everything together.  The irons were a little sloppy today, but for the most part yesterday and the front nine was pretty good here today.  I've just got to piece that together.  If I can piece it together it will be less stressful out there for me and I'll get back to the form that I'm trying to get back to.
Q. When are you planning to get there?
JASON DAY: I've got a NetJets day that I've got to do tomorrow.  And take the rest of the week and go to the Cavs on Wednesday (laughter.)  Got to support the team.  Not second row, I'm sitting right in the front row.  The wife isn't coming (laughter).
So I've got -- I'm going to go see that and then Friday I'm going to head up to Erin Hills.  I will try to play nine holes Saturday and Sunday, take a little practice.  Take my time a little bit more so on the weekend just so I'm comfortable.  Because the elevation change, the green complexes and then the shaved off areas are very key for the short game and knowing where to hit it and not to hit it.  So I'll take a little bit more time on the weekend.
And then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, play nine holes, execute some sort of game plan.  If I need to change or tweak anything then do that.  And then try to rest up, because it is a very brutally long golf course.  It's the U.S. Open, it's going to be mentally and physically demanding.  You have to make sure you can get the best rest you can possibly get because the recovery is quick.
Q. Are you a quick study when you've never been to a place?
JASON DAY: The good thing is that hardly anyone, from the U.S. Amateur, maybe a handful of guys, maybe less, but everyone's kind of new to the golf course.  Kind of like Chambers Bay, to a certain degree.  I think when -- it's most likely kind of level playing field when stuff like that happens.  U.S. Open tries to eliminate the big numbers, get yourself in the fairways.  Get your birdies when you can.  Always try and stay positive, and never think you're out of it.  That's kind of the keys that you have to go into.  The emotional control that you have out there, the attitude that you bring into that tournament is key going forward.  All good stuff.
