Q. Just some comments on your match today.  Looked like in the middle stretch, it was tough.  Whenever you guys made a birdie, they did, as well.
JASON DAY: Well, I think we were a couple under through nine holes, and Jordan was 5-under on his own ball.  Overall I think they were 9-under, as well, and I think we were 5-under total.
But just, like I said, you can't argue with good play.  If they play better than you, then that's just how it is.  You've just got to try to do the best job you can, and today they played better than us and got the win.
But we've got good momentum going into tomorrow.  We're only one back, which is good.  It's been close.  This is probably the closest -- this is the closest that I've been ever since I've played The Presidents Cup, this is as close as I've been to going into Sunday matches.
Q. What's that feeling like for you?
JASON DAY: It's all positive stuff.  We are excited about it, and I think the guys are having fun.  We understand that there's still a lot of matches out there, so we've just got to keep playing and leave it all out on the golf course tomorrow and see how it goes.
Q. When you guys finished 15, what was the situation when you went to 16?  Did you want to play?
JASON DAY: Yeah, we wanted to play.  I'm sure they wanted to get it over and done with, but if it went to 17, I was like, well, keep going.  Because obviously we don't want to come back in the morning.  But it was the only real shot we had at trying to halve the match, because we had good momentum going, and unfortunately just ran out of daylight.
