 Q.  Three back, still a chance tomorrow?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, like I said, if I can find my golf ball, I might have a good chance at winning the tournament.  Today I just had no clue where it was going today.  Was missing both left and right.  The biggest thing for me was to try to commit to a golf shot.  I was standing over there going, just get it down there somewhere; instead of committing to a target, committing to a shot and hitting it.  The biggest unknown is, is it going to go right, is it going to go left, and you have that in the back of your head, I've been missing it all day, all day.   
When you're driving it on a string like I was the end of last year, and middle part of this year, as well, start of this year, all you're thinking about is getting up there and hitting as hard as you can and hitting at a target.   
Yeah, it's all exciting stuff like this.  I think if I can have a decent shot at hitting fairways tomorrow, I might give myself an opportunity.   
 Q.  How do you fix that overnight?  
JASON DAY: You know what, I'm tired, I think I walked like ten-plus miles just from where I was hitting it off the map.  Some holes, I didn't even see Adam.  I just met him up at the green and said, "How ya doing?"  It was just a struggle today.   
Tomorrow I've just got to grind it, do the best job I can, and try and commit to a shot.  That's the hardest thing is saying, committing to a shot, it sounds so easy.  But when you're standing over it and trying to hit a fairway and trying to hit a target, it's a lot harder than it is.   
I think if I can find the sync.  I feel like I'm just a little bit out of sync with my driver swing.  If I can sync up well tomorrow, get good confidence starting on the front side, hopefully I give myself an opportunity.   
 Q.  The fact that you can focus solely on this tournament and not The Ryder Cup, not getting to THE TOUR Championship; is that a benefit?  
JASON DAY: I'm in great position going into the next three events after this.  Obviously coming in this week at No. 1 on the FedExCup is good position.   
Right now I'm just trying -- I'm just trying to get to the hole with the least amount of strokes that I can, even though it looks like I'm just whacking away and doesn't look like much.  I'm just trying to focus on that.  The biggest thing for me is to really try and win this one.  I got off to a great start last year by winning The Barclays.  Gets you a boatload of points and gets you so far in front of the field, if I can do that, will get me in great position going into THE TOUR Champs.   
Right now I'm in such good position, I'm not focused on getting to THE TOUR Championship.  If I keep playing well, I'll be there anyways.  And guys on the cusp of getting in The Ryder Cup, that's obviously another good distraction to have.  So we'll see how it goes.   
 Q.  Do you still have to be encouraged by the fact that you were under par, on a tough day, when the course is keeping it close for the guys in the late groups?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, definitely.  I said yesterday, it was going to be tight.  It seems like 8-under could stay there for the lead after today.  It didn't move at all, which is nice for me.  I said at the start of the week, just got to keep close to the lead, if it stays there, I'm three shots back.  And if I can get on the fairway and give myself opportunities, who knows.  But until then, get some good rest.  I need it, especially after today's round.
