Q. They just wouldnt fall for you today would they Jason, all afternoon?
JASON DAY: Today was ‑‑ pretty much the whole week I was just out of position, for the most part. Kind of disappointing week, from tee to green. On the green was great when I gave myself the opportunity I felt like I could capitalize on, but today I didn't give myself the opportunity.

Q. Even those first few days when you said you were just trying to grind it out, you were still right in position today werent you?
JASON DAY: I was just trying to grind out as much as possible those three days and today there was definite score opportunities if you put your ball in position, and unfortunately I wasn't able to get my ball in position. When you do that, it's very difficult to try to score. 
At the end of the day Danny played fantastic to shoot‑‑ I think he shot 5‑under or something like that. 67, it's a terrific score around here, especially with how he's been playing lately, he definitely deserves to win. 

Q. What are your feelings, you feel you will win a green jacket?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I've just got to keep myself‑‑ although it was a disappointing week from tee to green, it wasn't that bad. I've just got to keep working hard. And then hopefully the hard work will pay off. But I'll look at what I did wrong this week and try and improve that in future tournaments here.
But it is what it is. I've got to keep fighting and keep trying to win as many as I can.

Q. It didnt really unfold --
JASON DAY: No, not really. The first few days were a good grind for me. But today from tee to green today wasn't that good. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. And then when you're out of position and you don't quite give yourself the opportunities, it's tough to get any sort of score going. It is what it is. I've just got to try to focus on what I need to do for next year. 

Q. Were you tired or anything?
JASON DAY: No, everything was just fine. I came out and I just didn't feel quite comfortable with my swing. And when you're not quite comfortable with your swing and obviously you start thinking about it rather than trying to just get up there and look at the target and hit at it. It's hard to kind of get anything going from there once you do that.

Q. What, if anything, what will you take from today?
JASON DAY: My short game was still going well, especially the putting. So I just need to tidy up the long game a little bit. And get it going for next week.

Q. When you saw the change on the leader board what was your reaction?
JASON DAY: I was on 15 and I was absolutely shocked when I saw Jordan go from 5 to 1. It's tough. It's tough to win major championships. So many things and emotions, so many things go through your mind. Sometimes you just don't feel comfortable on certain shots. And unfortunately he hit a bad shot and another bad shot. Right now it's unfortunate and I'm sure he's killing himself for it. But we all do it to ourselves. Hopefully he just learns from it and gets better. You go out and led for seven rounds at Augusta since last year. He's done a fantastic job. Once again, it's tough to finish at a major, but hopefully he learns from it and gets better and comes back stronger.

Q. In hindsight where did it get away from you today?
JASON DAY: I would say‑‑ the backside wasn't what I would like it to be. You can't get close to the pins and if you're not close to the pins you're aiming 20, 30 feet away from the pins to get it somewhat close. You've got to really hit your golf ball well around here to really get any sort of opportunity.

Q. 17 was frustrating yesterday?
JASON DAY: I just pulled it a little bit. I only pulled it about six feet. If it was further right, straight at the pin it would have been stone dead and it kind of just fell off.
No, I mean it's not too bad. To be honest, I wasn't really thinking about 17. The backside I just sort of gave up, actually.
