Q. Jason, finished at 6-under, just comments about how it went out there today?
JASON DAY: Yeah, didn't have the greatest front.  Yeah, it was a little bit tough.  I just try to restart on the back side and get things going that way.  I don't know how I play tee to green.  It must not have been too good.  But I was walking up 13, I said let's try and birdie 13, 14, 15, par 16, because I know how tough that was, and try to birdie 17, 18.  Close on 17 and 18, but it was nice to get back under par and moving forward for the weekend.
Q. Do you feel like you could make a big run starting tomorrow?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I'm just hoping that we get some nice weather.  It would be good for us and good for the fans to come out and enjoy some nice weather instead of having to deal with some thunderstorms.  But if that's the case, then things will soften up a little bit.  If they soften up, you can definitely start firing at pins, being a little bit more aggressive.
The greens are in tremendous shape, but also saying that on the other hand, once they do get a little softer, there is going to be some foot traffic around the holes.  It will be a lot tougher to hole putts.  I definitely think if I can give myself a lot more opportunities tomorrow, I think I can go low, because right now over the ball, over the putter, I feel pretty good.
Q. How would you assess your swing now compared to earlier in the year?  Are you feeling pretty good about it?
JASON DAY: I've gone through three sets of irons, unfortunately.  It's not the swing, and it's not even -- I guess the blade -- long story short.  The CG in the blade is two millimeters closer to the heel, so it really turns over very easily.  I like the blade that I actually jumped into right before Augusta.  I didn't see any of this, which was nice.  But unfortunately, it just wanted to go left.  When you start fighting it left, it bleeds into your driving, and that's not what I really wanted, so I changed back to these irons and driving a little bit which was nice.  Give myself some time and practice with these, trying to see it starting to left to right.  I think it will start to soften out that ball flight.  I'll be able to hit that soft one when I need to.
So it's more so just trying to get back to how I was playing beforehand, because I won with the old set 750s at Torrey, then I won with the blades at Wells Fargo, and now I've got a whole new set in the bag.  So fingers crossed, I'll get another win this week.
Q. Can you speak to the risk-reward nature of the golf course?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I mean, definitely it's exciting.  With how they changed 15 around, it really is neat because you've got pretty much starting from 10 through 18, 10 is a pretty difficult par-4.  I mean, you can get a birdie away if you can get a good one there.  But for the short par-3, you get a good drive on the next hole.  I mean, it kind of goes -- you know, if you are hitting it well, you can get things going pretty quick.
If you're not hitting it well and you're leaving yourself in bad positions off the tee, then it's very difficult to get it close to the hole.  So 15, 16, 17, 18, tremendous, tremendous finish.  I absolutely love it coming down that stretch.  So it should be exciting over the weekend if we get some nice weather and it starts to dry out.  15 is starting to play very firm.  I hit 4-iron there today, and I think, you know, if you get anything turning, it feeds off into the water.  So how that is playing, I think that's a perfect hole to sit if you're a fan and watch some golf.
I'm looking forward to the weekend.  I think it should be a lot of fun.
