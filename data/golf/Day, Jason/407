 Q. Just talk about the conditions if you can rehash that a little bit. 
 JASON DAY: Yeah, it was tough. It's just unfortunate that the weather didn't extend on. That's just Open golf. It's unpredictable with the bounces. Sometimes you get good bounces and sometimes you get good weather, and sometimes you get the exact opposite. You've just got to take the good with the bad and just look forward to tomorrow. 

 Q. Talk about the 8th hole. The wind was just howling into you, wasn't it?
 JASON DAY: Yeah, there was a moment where me and Bubba looked at each other and started laughing. The rain was coming down really hard. I was out there clubbing four to five club winds. I hit 2-iron from 180. On 4 it was 240 to get back out in the fairway, and I hit my drive 200 yards and absolutely smoked it. You know, there was a moment there where it was getting very, very strong, and you just can't do anything about it. It's just weather.

 Q. What did you say you hit your second shot into 4 with?
 JASON DAY: Well, I played it as a par-5 and I made 6. But I hit 2-iron just short, missed it to the right, and then chipped and two-putted. But yeah, it was tough. Although, you know, I expected to come in today and try and play well, and whatever happened, happened.
