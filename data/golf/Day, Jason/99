Q. At least you gave yourself a chance to be here for the weekend.
JASON DAY: Yeah, it was a bit of a struggle the last two days.  Yesterday we didn't really have anything going in the group yesterday.  All of us played pretty poorly.
And today watching Scotty play, he hit a lot of great shots.  It was pretty impressive to watch him play some golf.
I just really had no momentum.  Hoping to make the weekend.  I will try to shoot something very, very low on the weekend, give myself some good vibes going into the U.S. Open.
Obviously Jason is playing tremendous golf, 14 or so under.  So obviously that's a lot of work to catch up.  But by the looks of it, if you're hitting a lot of good shots and giving yourself the opportunities on the greens, it's definitely out there.
Obviously I've just -- if I can get to the weekend, that would be great.  Just to give myself a chance.
Q. What positives can you take from what you've done so far?
JASON DAY: If there's much positive -- I didn't hit a lot of good iron shots and my chipping and putting wasn't that sharp.  If I do have the weekend off that gives me some good rest going into the U.S. Open, which is a good thing.  And I get to actually do some work with the new trainer.  If I do have the weekend off, I can kind of get after it a little bit and make small adjustment changes for the swing going forward and hopefully that turns out to be more consistency through the whole bag and helps later on down the road.  But fingers crossed that I get to the weekend.
Q. Coming into the week, did you have a good feel about your game?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I did.  But obviously if you know my track record around here, it's not very good.  It's just tough.  I live here.  I usually plan out -- I usually plan out at the start of each year what tournaments I'm going to play and what courses I play well on.  This is typically one that if I wasn't living here I wouldn't play because I typically don't play well here.  But since I live here and I'm a member, you kind of have to.  You know what I mean?  I just -- I think it's more so changing the mindset going forward.
Q. Can you put your finger on why you've struggled?  How many times do you play here just recreationally?
JASON DAY: Wednesday was the first -- Wednesday, this week, was the first day I played actually 18 holes here.  It's not much.  I tend to practice a lot more.  It's just an awkward kind of -- it's awkward because it's a second shot golf course.  The greens are quick.  If you get yourself out of position on the golf course then you struggle to make par.  And you have to hit a lot of fairways here.
And to me you have a lot of 3-woods in your hands.  In the past I haven't typically liked my 3-wood as much as the rest of my clubs.  That's why I hit driver or 2-iron.  You get more drivers in your hands, you miss a few more fairways.  The rough is up at least three inches, so you can't get any sort of -- anything going.  And when you're birdieing and bogeying kind of on the trot, you just kind of pushing crap uphill, and unfortunately there's no good crap.
