 Q.  All 18 holes filled with plenty of drama some of that coming on the front nine.  What was your perspective of what would to Phil on the 7th hole and on the 8 tee?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, I mean, it's obviously a rule I'm not familiar with and not many people are.  I didn't realize you could lose two holes in one.  There you go.  You can apparently.  That was that.  Nothing much I can say about it.   
 Q.  What type of impact, if any, did you have as everyone was trying to digest what was happening?  
JASON DAY: Oh, I mean, it's just things happen.  Phil came up to me on the 7th fairway and said, I tee'd off with the wrong ball.  Yeah, he understood the rule to a certain point where he picked it up and took himself out of the hole.   
But it was just kind of a long process for those guys and for us as well.  We just had to focus on what we needed to do and try and get on the ball on the green and give ourselves a chance at birdies.   
Obviously it's just tough when things like that happen, and they happen.  Unfortunately it happened with Phil.  He was using a Titleist yesterday.  Unfortunately just had it in the bag.   
 Q.  What does this half point mean by days' end for you guys?  
JASON DAY: I mean, we were up early.  I mean, obviously 2-up going into the 8th hole, and then they clawed their way back and got up 1.   
For us to kind of pull back and get that half was good.  I mean, kind of a good momentum kick for us going into tomorrow's round.   
Obviously the start of the today's session we weren't looking too good, but now we kind of tied it up.   
 Q.  What does this session and the performance by the internationals mean for your team moving forward?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think it's going to be big for our team spirit going forward.  Obviously a tough start yesterday, but even halving our match is a plus for us today.  Of course we would've liked to have won, but to win a session is big.
