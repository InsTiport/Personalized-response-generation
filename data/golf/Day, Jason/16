JASON DAY: The way the greens were it can make you look like a pretty big fool out there sometimes and unfortunately I couldn't quite handle the, what the wind and the greens on the back side -- I had four 3-putts actually on the back side. So obviously, it was disappointing the way that I putted because I actually hit it actually pretty decent. So overall I'm happy about the week, but also I wish I would have given it more of a chance.
Q. And as for the entire week, how big of a step forward was it for you?
JASON DAY: No, it's a good positive step forward. I can't obviously sit back and be angry at it, obviously, due to the fact that I've been injured a good part of a year now and I haven't had a really good finish in a long time. So this is a good positive step in the right direction.
Q. How much do you enjoy playing at this tournament?
JASON DAY: I love it here. I top-5 a lot here, so hopefully next year can I win.
Q. With the omen of celebrities and amateurs, what's that like?
JASON DAY: It's cool. Larry Fitzgerald was just over there congratulating me on seeing me play well, and it seems like he wins this every week that he plays. But it's always fun to play with the celebs, seeing the celebs and obviously the amateurs as well. I think everyone has a really good time here and you couple that with good weather, it's a neat place to come and play. This is a beautiful area to be at it and it always makes me happy to come back.
Q. Is there anyone that you wanted to met or didn't meet that you had fun with this week?
JASON DAY: You know what, I've kind of met most guys, but it's been fun to catch up with some old friends, so I'm looking forward to coming back next year.
