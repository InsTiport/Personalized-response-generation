JASON DAY: I think the plus side was that I didn't actually have to go out.  Obviously if you get off to a bad start, you're thinking about it, and vice versa is if you get off to a good start, you're thinking about it, as well.
I haven't hit a golf shot today, so hopefully we can get it in over the next day or so.  It would be nice to get the 72 holes in.
Q. What's the plan moving forward?  Tomorrow is a question mark, too.
JASON DAY: That's what I heard.  Just be patient and really try to let it come and see what we can get out of it.  Obviously the rain is going to soften up the golf course, so you've got to be a little bit aggressive out there.  It should yield a few more birdies and if you can do that, but also stay patient with regards to the weather, just keep yourself mentally intact.  Because a lot of sitting around can get you kind of off base and if you don't stay on top of it, you can start playing some poor golf.  I just need to make sure I stay on top of it.
