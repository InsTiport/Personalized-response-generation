 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JASON DAY:   Played good, played nice.   With Louis having a sore back, he didn't look like he had a sore back out there with how well he played.   It's tough to play against a really good golfer, no expectations, just free wheel it and whatever happens, happens.   He's been playing well the whole week.   I've been playing well, as well.   Just glad get it in the house.  
   
 Q.   Playing 36 holes tomorrow.   Of course, the most important match stroke play is the one in the morning.   What did you learn from last year that ultimately will give you more success, at least into the finals?  
JASON DAY:   Well, I think last year I was mentally and physically done by Sunday with how the weather was.   We had a lot of snow, and I was wearing four layers, three layers on the bottom, two pairs of socks.   Everything I could find in my suitcase I was putting on.  
So this year is a different story.   I feel a lot fitter this year.   I'm ready to go out there and play 36 holes and the next big thing is just to get the mind right, knowing that I may be playing 36 holes, regardless.   I've just got to go out there and grind and find a way to win.
