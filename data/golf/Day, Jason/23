 Q.  Your 11th career start at this tournament. You made the cut in the previous 10. Six top-6 finishes. How can that past success help spearhead you on to what you're doing here the first couple days?  
JASON DAY: I feel very comfortable here. I obviously love the golf courses here. I've always played well at Monterey Peninsula. And Pebble's always been one of my favorite golf courses to play. This is a really neat experience, especially when we have nice weather like this. It's really pretty to go out and walk the fairways. But yeah, I've had good finishes here, so that obviously helps as well.   
 Q.  The putter is hot, especially on 18. What are you seeing differently maybe the past couple of days that you haven't in weeks and months past?  
JASON DAY: Oh, yeah, it's been, it feels like it's been awhile since I've had a good day of putting. But I think I went back from a black putter to the red putter and I can just see the lines a little bit better and that's given me a lot more confidence and all I have to do is just make sure I get the speeds rights and if do that I putt like I did today.   
 Q.  You've been very open about battling injuries, physically how do you stand right now as you look to achieve some big things in 2020?  
JASON DAY: Yeah, I mean it's always wake up with a few niggles here and there, but it's, yeah, you wake up with a little bit of pain, but it's okay, I've been working very, I've been very disciplined about the rehab, I had six, seven weeks of rehab before Torrey Pines and I'm trying to stay on top of that right now and for the most part I feel pretty good. It's cold, usually when it's cold my back doesn't really like to cooperate, but it's been, touch wood, been really nice.
