Q.   Tell us about your round today?
JASON DAY:   It was solid.   Not too sure what the stats were, I believe I hit a lot of greens which was nice, and had a good chip‑in on 11, which was also nice.   But I think overall, just a little sloppy after the rain delay.   Came out and just lost a few, but other than that, happy with how things were going.

Q.   Where were you with the drive on 18?
JASON DAY:   I was in the shadows.   Apparently got a little lucky and kept bouncing along.   Ended up having a good‑‑ well, it was a pretty decent drop from where I was and just tried to hook a little 52 around the trees and ended up nicely on the green. 

Q.   Nice putt? 
JASON DAY:   Yeah, it was a good putt.   I was surprised that it didn't break a little bit more, but overall, very happy with how I played today. 

Q.   Is there any change because of the weather? 
JASON DAY:   Any change?   Well, I mean, it's just the greens obviously got a little softer.   So it's a little bit more‑‑ the greens are kind of‑‑ they are very receptive right now.   So it's not surprising that guys are going low, but with that said, it's making the greens a lot more bumpy as you would say.   So as long as you can get a good speed off the putter, it really doesn't affect it too much. 
So just very happy with a 67 today. 

Q.   You really had your game in shape for the majors. 
JASON DAY:   Yeah, I played pretty poorly last week, and I worked very hard last week to get my game up to scratch.   I worked very hard Monday through Wednesday here.   You know, it's good to see that the hard work over the last week and a half is paying off for the first round.
