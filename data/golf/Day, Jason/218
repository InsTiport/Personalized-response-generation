 Q.  Is it hard to set goals after having such a great year?  
JASON DAY: You know what, I'm just trying to put in 100 percent effort each and every day.  Last year was the first year that I actually stopped writing down goals and setting goals, because I just said to myself, I'm going to stick to the process and give it 100 percent every day and ended up having a great year.   
Kind of the same.  I just can't panic if it doesn't happen straightaway.  Have to keep doing all the work and as long as you keep doing the work hopefully it falls my way.   
Some years are going to be great.  Some years are going to be not so great.  I feel like I'm doing the work, so it's not from lack of trying, lack of effort.  I think I've just got to keep at it, and know if I can keep doing that, I know it's going to turn around.   
 Q.  I know it was kind of an up-and-down day, tough golf course, but just talk about your round today.  
JASON DAY: Yeah, it wasn't that bad.  I mean, shooting even par is not a bad score around here.  Obviously anything even par or under, you're kind of moving forward a little bit.  Yeah, it was a little rough day with me and my short game.  Usually that's kind of the strength of my game, and yeah, kind of -- I had no idea what the putts were doing out there on the greens.  And on top of it, wasn't chipping it close enough to hole those putts.  Yeah, four bogeys is not what I wanted to have, especially the first round.   
 Q.  Seems like a lot of guys are making birdies here and there, but they are making bogeys here and there, too.  
JASON DAY: Well, it's easy to do.  You miss a fairway and then you catch a flyer out of the rough, or not a flyer, so that's the hard calculation part of it.  Then once you miss a green, then around the greens is very, very patchy.   
So you can get lucky and then you can get very, very unlucky and if you get unlucky, then it's really difficult to try and get any sort of control coming out of the rough.  If you don't chip it close, you're scratching your head.  That's kind of -- I guess my round is very similar to what a lot of the other guys are doing out there.  They are probably making a few more mistakes than me, the guys under that are par.  Just that kind of course.   
 Q.  You're the kind of player that stays in there.  You've got the experience and you're just right there.  You didn't shoot yourself out of it today.  
JASON DAY: This is the kind of course where you have to grind and I don't mind doing that.  I haven't played well here in the past, but I've got a different approach to the golf course this year and I feel good about my game.  Once again, you said that I haven't shot myself out of it, which is great.  I've just got to take it a round at a time and just slowly, ever so slightly, just move myself up the leaderboard and hopefully I'm there on Sunday.
