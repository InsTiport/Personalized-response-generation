Q. You've done it again.  What a wonderful round of golf.  No bogeys, eight birdies.  Your emotions after winning the first FedExCup Playoff?
JASON DAY: I really wanted to get off to a good start.  I came into this expecting to give it a good shot.  I really wanted to win this tournament.  To be able to be there at the end of the week, with what happened, fantastic.  But to get over the line and play great today...
Q. Your putter, you were just lighting it up with the putter.
JASON DAY: Yeah, the funny thing was I kept saying, Let's just keep putting the ball in the middle of the green, don't get too crazy.  I did get a little aggressive with the shot on 4.  Ended up getting up and down.  But I ended up walking off saying, Why are you being so silly going for pin positions when if you give yourself a 20-footer, you'll hole it?
Those putts you're not expecting to hole, some of them were tough, but they went in.  The momentum kept going.
The par putt on 13 kept it going.  Yeah, one of those things where getting near the hole, they just fall in.  Great way to finish.
Q. What does this tell the rest of the world about how good you are?
JASON DAY: You know what, I'm just trying to improve each and every week.  My goal is always trying to get to No. 1.  I have two guys ahead of me right now in Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy.  But I'm playing really good golf right now.  It just goes to show how good they're really playing, and they're that far in front of me.
I've got a lot of work to do.  It is the start of the FedExCup Playoffs for me.  I just want to do a good job.
Q. It's been a good two weeks.  What did you learn about yourself after winning today?
JASON DAY: That it's much better to win by a lot than just having it close.  You know, I felt like it was a bit of grind in the start of my round.  Then once I starting holing some major putts on the backside, that kind of opened up the gap.
Just to be able to get it in the house and finish it off with a birdie on 18 was great.
Q. How comfortable are you feeling right now and how much fun are you having?
JASON DAY: It's a lot of fun.  I did start hitting a few right, which is very strange.  The whole week I was hitting them with my drives; that came out of nowhere.  Kind of made me nervous coming in.
But I feel comfortable with myself.  I feel confident.  But, you know, it's the first in the FedExCup Playoffs.  I'm looking forward to next week, get some rest over the next couple days.
