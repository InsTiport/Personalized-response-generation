Q. Not the score you were looking to get but you battled back.JASON DAY: Yeah, the way we all started was pretty poorly.  I'm just glad I got back to where I am today at the end of the day, and I'll just slowly try to build on it from there.
Q. Did you notice a difference from the way the course was playing from the start of the round to the end?JASON DAY: You know, we started on the 10th hole, and on that back nine, if you hit -- the rough is very healthy out there.  If you're just a bit off-line, it's pretty penalizing out there.  I just tried to straighten it out a little bit on the front nine.  I played so much better, kind of got in a groove a little bit and came out strong.
Q. How are you feeling?  Thumb holding up?JASON DAY: Yeah, the thumb's fine.  Thumb feels good.  There's no issue with that.  I'm going to go do some practice this afternoon and kind of straighten things out a little bit.  Over the last couple weeks, it's just kind of been a little loose off the tee and into the greens, as well.  Just kind of fighting myself.  I think if I can kind of straighten that out a little bit, it will be good.
Q. Given that it's the first round and knowing that you've scored well here, how does that set up for the weekend?JASON DAY: Well, I think the way they have got it set up is pretty tough. We'll see how it goes at the end of the day.  I know that it's obviously not going to lead or anything like that, and I know there are guys that have played great already. I've just got to slowly kind of plod my way.  If they keep the course setup like this the way they have over the last few days, I've just got to keep at it and be patient with myself.
