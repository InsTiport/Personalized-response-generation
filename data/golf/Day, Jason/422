 Q. Talk about your start.
 JASON DAY: Came out of the blocks pretty quick which was nice. I had three birdies to start and then came back with bogey at 6 and 7. I was a little up-and-down today. 
 I felt like I didn't hit it differently compared to the last two day, I just didn't putt good enough, made a few more mental errors today, but I certainly didn't play myself out of the tournament today.

 Q. Talk about having a game plan and sticking to it. At what point tomorrow do you think that you can change that up?
 JASON DAY: Yeah, there's -- some of these pin positions are just so hard to capitalize on. 
 So obviously you have a game plan at the start of the day and you just need to stick to what -- obviously you need to putt and chip really well around here. And if the putts roll in tomorrow, that's great, if not, just got to give myself as many opportunities as I can tomorrow.
