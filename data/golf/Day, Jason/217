Q. 4-under 68, a good way to finish with a birdie on your last.  How would you assess the day?
JASON DAY: A little up-and-down, really.  It was just, wasn't the greatest 4-under that I ever shot.  It was just kind of a more of an ugly 4-under par.
Saved myself a lot with the short game.  And once again, I just for some reason just haven't been trusting the swing out there for me, especially with the short stuff.
And if you dig deep into the stats this week, you can tell that I've missed a lot of shots with my wedge in my hand and the scoring clubs have been pretty poor.  So, regardless of how things have panned out, I've actually kind of scrapped a score together, which is nice.
Hopefully the lead doesn't get too far away.
Q. A different rotation than last year, but very similar, a slow first round and trying to catch up.  How eerily similar to 2015?
JASON DAY: Yeah, it's definitely similar to 2015.  I'm hoping that I handle it like I did last year, tomorrow.
But all good stuff regardless of how I played the last few days.  I know that tomorrow is going to be a new day and you never know if I can get -- if I can tighten the stuff up that I've been kind of scrapping around and haven't been as tight as it should have been, if I can do that, then hopefully there's a really low score out there for me.
But it's going to be tough tomorrow.  Not too sure what the weather is going to hold for us, but the greens and the fairways are running out and it's fantastic weather, so we're looking forward to a good day.
