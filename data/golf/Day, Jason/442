 Q. Just some general comments on your round today. 
 JASON DAY: Yeah, basically I put myself into pretty good position for the weekend. I hit it very awful today, only five fairways, but at least my putting was there. Very happy that my short game was there, but I'll just try to keep things up for the weekend, hit some fairways to give myself some opportunities out there. I know that I can't keep shooting under par with the way I'm hitting it. 

 Q. Are you surprised scores aren't lower? 
 JASON DAY: It's surprising. You know, it's not a very -- if you hit it a little wide it can be tough, but if you're a straight hitter -- the greens are the toughest thing to hit. You've got to make sure you calculate the right bounce and roll. 
 I'm guessing that single digits is going to win over the weekend, so you just want to -- there's a lot of guys that are in play, guys that are even par could still win this thing. So still a little work to do. 

 Q. Having won a tournament now, how does that help you prepare?
 JASON DAY: Well, today was just like some of the rounds back at the Byron Nelson in Dallas. I just know that I need to work on a few things just to try and get it straightened out a little bit. I'm a lot more relaxed. If I go out there and do well and hopefully finish it off, then that's great. But as long as I give it 100 percent, I'm okay with that.
