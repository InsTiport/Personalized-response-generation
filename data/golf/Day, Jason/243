Q. Jason, tough day, I know.  Just get some comments on your round.
JASON DAY: There's no excuse for poor playing.  I just wish I had a little bit more energy.  Actually I hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.  I didn't have the stuff on the greens that I wanted to have.
Q. It has been a long run.  At some point do you feel like you're going on adrenaline and you kind of run out?
JASON DAY: Yeah, I'm just trying to keep pushing forward.  No matter what I did, if I hit a good drive I hit a poor second shot into the green and left myself a long put.  If I hit a nice shot into the green I left myself a good putt or good opportunity for birdie and I missed the putt.  I couldn't get any momentum.  It's unfortunate, but sometimes it happens like that.  But tomorrow is another day.  I'll get rested up and try to come in and shoot the lights out tomorrow.
Q. Going into tomorrow, is there anything you need to work on or is it more just getting a good night's sleep?
A. It's just rest.  Unfortunately I'd like to tell you -- I hit it kind of poor yesterday off the tee, went and worked on, I was hitting much better today.  I don't know how to explain but that's how I feel inside.  I'll try and rest up and come out tomorrow and take a walk.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JASON DAY: I just haven't stopped.  People don't realize that.  It doesn't stop, especially from PGA through that week off, I had no time to sleep.  And then on top of it going and winning the next week.  So it was just kind of nonstop.  And it's kind of been like that the whole summer.  This coming week is going to be good for me.  I'll just try and get as much rest as possible.
