Q. A great finishing round of 69.  Kevin Tway joins us at the SkyCam.  How are you feeling about your play in the final round?
KEVIN TWAY: It was good.  I got off to a good start.  I had a little hiccup, which was unfortunate.  Hung in there after that and pretty pleased with how I played.
Q. Only your fourth start on the PGA TOUR.  After a great start you tied the lead after this birdie.  How were you feeling out there?
KEVIN TWAY: I was feeling okay.  I knew the conditions were a little bit easier today so you could kind of attack and make some birdies.
Q. You've had success on the Web.com.  How much could you lean on that coming down the stretch as we look at 15, some great playing?
KEVIN TWAY: Yeah.  I've been in contention a few times last year on the Web.com.  You always use those experiences no matter what.  Winning is winning.
Q. So we now can change that stat for your new best stat, Top-3 finish on the PGA TOUR.  In terms of how that makes you feel going forward, you'll have time to reflect on this.  What about the rest of the season?
KEVIN TWAY: I've always known I was good, I just kind of get in my own way sometimes.
