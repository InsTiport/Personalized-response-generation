Q. 4-under, 66 today.  Was looking a lot lower than that, but the last few holes are playing difficult with the wind today.
KEVIN TWAY: Yeah, had it good through 13 holes.  Finish is pretty tough and I hit a couple loose shots as well.  Kind of sucks to finish bogey-bogey, but last holes are definitely tough.
Q. Good tournament here last year.  What did you learn here last year at this golf course?
KEVIN TWAY: Hitting the ball in the fairway is a big key.  This course kind of fits my eye so I love coming back here.  Just if I hit the ball in the fairway I got a lot of wedges, so try to capitalize on those.
Q. Talk about the last two holes.  Still right there.
KEVIN TWAY: Yeah, it's disappointing, but I didn't hit very good shots, so you're going to make bogeys.  I'll have some lunch and probably forget about it after that.
Q. Talk about 15.  Could've been dangerous for you but you had a nice save there.
KEVIN TWAY: Yeah, it was a good par save.  Got kind of lucky that the ball was where it was.  Big wind off the left and I just didn't hit it solid.
Yeah, couple loose shots in the end, but I'll try to figure it out on the range in a little bit.
Q. Do you have a number for tomorrow to be in the hunt at the end of the day?
KEVIN TWAY: No.  It's too early to tell.  I don't even think the leaders have played many holes.  Just try to hit the fairway and green because it's going to be windy.  That's about my only focus.
