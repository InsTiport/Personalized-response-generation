Q. What did you see on that hole-in-one?
KEVIN TWAY: I hit 5-iron.  I was trying to go a little left of the hole.  When I hit it, I was kind of like, oh, no, it's gone long.  But it was going right at it.  We couldn't really see anything.  We just heard the roars.
Q. How big of a lift is that for you, considering you're in that bubble group, 69, 70, 71?
KEVIN TWAY: Yeah, I mean, I'm not trying to think about it, but yeah, it is there.  It's always nice to make a hole-in-one.  They don't come very often.  So excited about that.
Q. How many have you made?
KEVIN TWAY: I made one in a tournament on the Web.com Tour.
Q. Your father had one; right?
KEVIN TWAY: He's had a lot on the TOUR.  I don't know how many but he's had a lot through the years.
Q. Were you ever around for them?
KEVIN TWAY: No, I can't say.
Q. What did you think of the golf course?
KEVIN TWAY: It's hard.  You've got to put the ball in the fairway and on the green and try to make a few birdies, but pars are good, too.
Q. How did you play 12?
KEVIN TWAY: I hit 2-iron off the tee, and then had 3-iron to the green.
Q. Did you play it short?
KEVIN TWAY: Yeah, I made bogey.  So may as well try something different tomorrow.
