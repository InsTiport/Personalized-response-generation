 Q.   To get off to a start like this at 6â€‘under, you must be pretty happy?   
KEVIN TWAY:   Yeah, I was happy.   I hit a lot of fairways and greens, which, if you hit the ball on the fairway, you can get at some pins and maybe some putts which is always nice.  
   
 Q.   This course is playing well, and everyone's raving about it.   What are your thoughts about the way the course is playing?   
KEVIN TWAY:   Yeah, it's playing good.   Everything is in great shape.   They got a lot of rain, so everything's real lush, and the rough's real long, so keeping the ball on the fairway is definitely what you need to do.  
   
 Q.   Mindset for the rest of the week?   How do you approach Friday and Saturday?   This is the first Friday, and now you have the rest of the week?  
KEVIN TWAY:   Just keep doing what I'm doing.   Trying to hit fairways and greens, and have good speed on my putts and hopefully a couple will fall.  
   
 Q.   Is one club one real strength of your round today?   
KEVIN TWAY:   I drove the ball well.   I think I only missed one fairway, which was the last one.   So when you put yourself on the fairway, the greens are pretty receptive so you can fire at the pins.  
   
 Q.   How would you say, everyone says the course is in good shape, but if you played here before, does it compare to other years?   
KEVIN TWAY:   I played in 2011.   It's probably in a little better shape now.   The greens are rolling good.   Everything's in good shape.  
   
 Q.   Going into Friday, just keep the same thing going?   
KEVIN TWAY:   Yeah, absolutely, fairways and greens.   I had good speed on my putts and just have some fun.
