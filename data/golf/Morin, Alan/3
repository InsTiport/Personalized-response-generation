Q.  How did the course play today? 

ALAN MORIN:   Course was fine.  I just didn't play very well.  I hit some good shots but then just turned right around and hit some bad shots.  Took too many bad shots.  I'm just very disappointed right now, because I was hitting the ball very well the whole week coming into this, practicing well, thinking well, going by my game plan during the practice rounds and just nothing went right today.  I mean, nothing went right. 


Q.  Any holes stick out in your mind, a little tougher than the others?

ALAN MORIN:   Not really.  I feel totally comfortable on this golf course.  I hit it straight enough.  Today I don't know; just nothing went right. 


Q.  Will you change anything for tomorrow?

ALAN MORIN:   No.  Same thing.  Worst round of my career today and just go out tomorrow and try to enjoy the day.
