 Q.  We've talked a little bit about it, but the consistency at the end of the year, it is safe to say it's been a rhythm thing to where you're just comfortable in everything you're doing and the results were showing?  
LIZ NAGEL: I think so. I have good thoughts swing-wise, on the greens, putting-wise. I think Paul and I, my caddie, are in a good rhythm.   
Yeah, just kind of one shot at a time. It's definitely a Marathon out here, so...   
 Q.  When you have the good thoughts, what's the biggest thing to make sure those don't go away? You're bound you have a shot or two you don't like here.  
LIZ NAGEL: Yeah, think if anybody knew the exact answer to that they'd be -- you know, that's the golden ticket.   
I think for me, just like staying patient and knowing that I'm not going to hit every shot perfect, so try to keep those thoughts always just fresh.   
Like right now. I hit it great today, but I am still going to go hit a couple balls just to make sure like I got my thoughts together type of thing.
