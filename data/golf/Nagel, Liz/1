 Q.  Always trying to shoot as low as you can, but how big are those days?  
LIZ NAGEL: No, that was big because it wasn't as easy as the first two days. I had to scramble a lot more.   
Made a lot of birdie putts for par. I made a great 10-footer there, a great 13-footer there. I mean, it's like, yeah.   
And that's big, too, because it's like moving forward I know that like I can make those putts when they're for birdie. And I had some birdie looks, but, you know, they're not obviously all going to go in. I made couple good putts when they counted, so it was good.   
 Q.  Any emphasis on tomorrow getting a good round in before you transition to a new course?  
LIZ NAGEL: No. I mean, I think they're all kind of the same. Looking forward to sunshine, though. That'll be nice.
