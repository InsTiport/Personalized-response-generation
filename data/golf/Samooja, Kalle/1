 Q.  7-under.  How did the round go for you today?  
KALLE SAMOOJA: I think I was hitting the ball quite solid all day.  A couple bad shots, of course, there in the middle of my round, but I made the chances I had.  When I came to 15, it was a perfect number for me and I hit a good shot and when it landed, I saw that it has a chance to go in, and so it disappeared.  So it was a nice moment there.   
Then, of course, had a few more holes to go.  So a step up from there.  Took a shot on 16 and 2-putted and good approach on 17, which got me to 7-under.  Actually a really good par on 18 from the bottom left fringe.  It was a nice round.   
 Q.  You see quite a few times on Tour when someone gets a hole-in-one, maybe the next couple of holes, trying to get the emotions back down.  To then go birdie, birdie, how did you manage to control your emotions after the 15th?  
KALLE SAMOOJA: Well, I wasn't too overwhelmed after the hole-in-one.  For us players, it's the same as making an eagle, hitting a wedge in, something like this.  Two shots off the scorecard, and you just need to move on.  There's a lot of golf to play.  So just try to forget it as quick as possible and move on.   
 Q.  What confidence out of the round today can you take into tomorrow and the rest of the week hopefully?  
KALLE SAMOOJA: I think overall how I played, and the game plan was good.  I had good numbers with my caddie.  The wind is not strong but it's hurting quite a lot, and also then helping quite a lot.  So to get the right yardage for the approach, that's I think the main key.  The greens are quite tricky to hit close, so you need to hit some good, accurate approach shots and that's what was the main focus basically for the whole week.  Hit really good iron shots and wedges.
