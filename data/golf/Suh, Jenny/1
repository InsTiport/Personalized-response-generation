  JENNY SUH:   I had a few tournaments leading up to Q‑school where I shot under par.   I talked to my fiancÃ© and my parents, big picture, you're playing so much better, just enjoy yourself.   
I'm 28 now, and leading into Q‑school I think he hinted towards engagement.   He's like, I don't know if this is going to be one of those years where you're crazy at Q‑school, but look at the big picture of life, and in the big picture of life this Q‑school won't really mean anything to you.   20 years down the road you'll have kids and everything.   So just look back and make sure you're able to smile and have fun.   
   
 Q.   You say that this isn't your first rodeo.   
JENNY SUH:   Well, I guess it's technically my third year with LPGA status.   In my first year in 2011 I was kind of outside the bubble, as well, where I was just trying to play my way in.   I think I made like two cuts, made a couple cuts coming in.   I got to like Wegmans, got to all the big tournaments, and it was basically like I had full status again.   
If I've learned anything, I've got to get reshuffled and play really well so I don't have to go back to Q‑school.   
   
 Q.   Shooting this kind of number is impressive enough, but on a day like today where it's gusting about 20, you have to really have good ball‑striking.   
JENNY SUH:   Well, the wind didn't really hit us like this until the back nine, which was my front nine.   But the front nine I believe I shot like 4‑under.   It's like, we're ahead of the game plan, let's just keep it going, take the opportunities as they come, let's not try to be crazy, just hit the ball in the fairway, hit the ball on the green and make a putt.  
   
 Q.   When exactly did you guys get engaged?  
JENNY SUH:   We got engaged on December 19th.   That was my parents' anniversary.   He was brave enough to do it in front of my parents, and he's still alive, so I guess they really like him.   
   
 Q.   How long exactly has Will caddied for you?  
JENNY SUH:   He's been caddying on and off for me since we started dating, which was like three and a half years now, and like I said yesterday, we got into some arguments out there about this shot, that shot.   He would respond back by saying, I'm not a caddie, I'm your fiancÃ©, you're not allowed to talk to me like that.   I'm like, you're right.   But it's kind of nice to have someone that keeps you in check out there.   Obviously if I had a normal caddie I would have talked to him and not said as many things as I said to Will and expressed how I'm feeling.   Will is better at reading me, and he can just bring me back down to the right level.   
   
 Q.   What's his full name?  
JENNY SUH:   William Britt.   He's been caddying on and off since we started dating.   It's not really his full time thing anymore.   I think I give him too many gray hairs to do that.   He's in real estate now in Florida, and of course I was like, I'd really like for you to come to the Bahamas with me to help me Monday qualify.   He's like, yeah, there's a casino.   I'm there.   I'll come with you.   I'm like, it's crazy you only come for the tournaments that have a casinos.   It's so weird.  
   
 Q.   What was your mindset about Monday qualifying?   When you decided to do that, what's the mindset?   
JENNY SUH:   You just go it like any other qualifier.   You know that you don't have a second day to back anything up, to fix any mistakes, so you just have to stay on your game, have to be patient.   Once you do find yourself in a trouble spot, don't try to be all heroic, just take that bogey and get out.   That's what a Monday qualifier is, and you just make as many birdies as possible.  
   
 Q.   Where do you guys live?  
JENNY SUH:   We live in the West Palm Beach/Jupiter area.  
   
 Q.   Did you grow up in that area?  
JENNY SUH:   No, we're both from Fairfax, Virginia.   We met before high school, because my team, they never qualified for regionals or states, so I would ask Will on the opposing team, can you come pick me up, and I would just sit on my doorstep just hoping that he would pick me up and I wouldn't get DQ'd for missing a tee time.  
   
 Q.   Asking about that Q‑school experience again, when you finish, you're so close to getting that full card, and you're in that tie position and you're in a playoff, what's the mentality when you don't earn that spot?   
JENNY SUH:   The mentality is it's golf.   I mean, I can't gripe about the fact that I missed the opportunity in a playoff or I missed it before by one shot.   That happens to everybody.   You can't be like, oh, if I would have made that putt I would have full status or if I made that putt I would have won the tournament.   Just coulda, woulda, shoulda.   I just left thinking, this is another year, we have a great opportunity.   If you would have told me going into Q‑school you're going to leave with status, not full status but some sort of status, I would have been like, oh, cool, that's great, that's awesome.   I just tried to leave happy.   You can't dwell on it too much.   It's just another tournament.   
   
 Q.   How many players for that last spot?   
JENNY SUH:   It was four players for two spots.   
   
 Q.   And what happened?   How many holes did you make it?   
JENNY SUH:   It was an aggregate like three‑hole playoff, missed like a short putt on my second hole.   Wasn't able to capitalize on the third hole for birdie.   It was like a reachable par‑5.   I just made pars all four holes because it extended into another hole, and girls made birdies.   That's just what happened.   Can't do anything about it.  
   
 Q.   So you had one person qualify after the three‑hole aggregate and then you went to sudden death for the other‑‑  
JENNY SUH:   And then one more qualifying, exactly.  
   
 Q.   How is Will doing on the tables?  
JENNY SUH:   I'm having better luck.   I'm having better luck out here.   Let's just keep it that way because sometimes he makes more money on the tables than I do at the tournament, so I'm like, this is a good sign.   I'll miss the cut, but it's okay, he'll get dinner.
