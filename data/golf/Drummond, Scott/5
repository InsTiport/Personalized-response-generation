SCOTT DRUMMOND: Absolutely delighted with the way I've played so far, I was solid rather than spectacular but that was what I wanted to do when I was going out, make sure I found the greens and make sure I was at least putting for a half.

The delay didn't affect me too much, I just took it easy with my practice, but I must admit I was surprised we went out at 10:50 A.M. The greenkeepers did a fantastic job to get the course playable after all the rain we had.

On the first tee I must admit I was very excited, more excited than nervous to be honest because it is great to have to the opportunity to play someone like Ernie and, of course, to play the way I did to give myself the chance to beat him. So far so good, I'll just have to try and do the same again this afternoon.

ERNIE ELS:  I wasn't happy with my iron play this morning. I just couldn't seem to get the yardage right on the second shots. That was the real problem, they were either coming up short or going long. It didn't help that I duck hooked my tee shot on the first. That's the way it started and didn't get much better after that.

Scott played well. He was very consistent and he is a tough opponent. I will have to do something about these mistakes with my iron shots but there is still a long way to go.
