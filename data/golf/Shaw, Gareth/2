 Q.   Give us your thoughts on what seemed to be a very nice second round here at The Irish Open?  
GARETH SHAW:   Yeah, delighted, great finish, three birdies in the last four.   With the wind getting up, it's looking ever more promising for me.  
   
 Q.   For the weekend you must be delighted?   
GARETH SHAW:   Obviously just got a call last week getting into the weekend; this week is a bonus for me.   I've been playing very solid all year, and again I played solid again today.   Hit a few ropey ones but held more putts today and that's probably the difference.  
   
 Q.   Before the tournament started you said making the cut was the real ambition; how do you reassess your goals?  
GARETH SHAW:   It's a bit early to reassess straightaway but I'm happy with it.   My game is solid, but it's all about the putting.   If I can hole some putts, you never know what can happen.  
   
 Q.   Lovely finish for you.   
GARETH SHAW:   Yeah, it is, because I was on the cut mark playing the last four holes, a stiff left‑to‑right breeze coming in there, and it's not my favourable wind, either.  
So I was very pleased how I handled it.   Hit some lovely putts and held a wedge shot into the last as well.  
   
 Q.   Were you thinking about the cut line?  
GARETH SHAW:   Of course you are.   I'm quite good when I'm on the cut mark of making the cuts; I don't know why, grind it out.   Again, today, it's more evidence that I can do that again and I'm delighted.  
   
 Q.   And this is your first full European Tour event, nice to play so well, I'll sure.   
GARETH SHAW:   Yeah, of course it is, home support, got my family here, girlfriend here, coach was down yesterday.   I've got all sorts of people and hopefully a few more will come down tomorrow and watch.
