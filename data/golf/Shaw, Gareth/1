 Q.   When you bogeyed the first two holes today, what was in your head?   
GARETH SHAW:   Par the next.   Got up the green and to putted.   Got off to a shaky stat, missed a short putt and then hit a great pitch shot and on 2, hit a poor wedge shot, spun it back off the green and missed another putt.   But steadied the ship and pitched in on 4 and that changed my outlook I suppose, my confidence, my belief, just momentum.   It really shifted momentum.  
   
 Q.   And you played the last 16 at 5‑under, which in these conditions, you must be very pleased with?  
GARETH SHAW:   Yeah, I'm delighted.   Obviously I eagled 13, is it, the driver I hit on the middle of the green there, I hit a good tee shot and held about a 45‑footer and that was a real bonus.   
It was the first long putt I held all week and going into those final five holes, the wind off the left, getting gusty, it steadied the ship and gave me a bit of breathing space, so delighted, absolutely.  
   
 Q.   Massive step for you in your career, prospect now if you can stay in the Top‑10, a place in France next week?  
GARETH SHAW:   Yeah, that was the goal I suppose going out.   After the first two holes, it was like, go on, just make it respectable and just kept going and going and it just got good.   Delighted how I handled myself, the crowd, first experience.   Yeah, absolutely buzzing.  
   
 Q.   Irish Open for the first time as a professional?   
GARETH SHAW:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   What's your feelings about playing in that now?  
GARETH SHAW:   Yeah, it's great.   It's great to be here.   It's where I'm working hard to get here and where I feel I belong and this is the case‑‑ the margins of where I'm playing on The Challenge Tour and the main tour, a few breaks here and there and a bit of luck along the way.   It's good incentive, you know.
