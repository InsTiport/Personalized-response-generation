 Q. Tell us how good that was. 
 PABLO MARTIN: I was really happy with the round, 4-under par with this wind, really happy with it. I've been playing really well, so it's always nice to start shooting under par. 

 Q. You said would you have a week off missing The European Open because your form had not been good; a lot of work in the meantime?
 PABLO MARTIN: Yeah, I worked on some really good stuff and just I think it's only the first day but overall I'm a lot happier and it's going to be good hopefully.

 Q. Did you figure out that something particular was wrong?
 PABLO MARTIN: Absolutely, when you're getting those kind of scores, it's probably more than one thing that happened that's wrong. I still have a lot to do, a lot of work to do, and you know, just keep improving and see how it goes.

 Q. And what was it that you worked on? 
 PABLO MARTIN: Everything, you know, from the swing, from my putting, to my head which was the biggest thing that I had to work on. 

 Q. So was it good to get out of tournament golf and refresh? 
 PABLO MARTIN: Yeah, I couldn't play any more tournaments the way I was doing. I only took one week off, but after this tournament, I'm going to have a few more weeks to work on things, and just keep improving. I'm not really expecting anything from this week, just try to play the bestic and try to fight every shot.

 Q. With this round off a 90-minute delay because of all the heavy rain that we had, how was it out there?
 PABLO MARTIN: It was good. I'm glad we had a 90-minute delay, because it gave me some time to wake me up. 
 The course is in really good shape after all the rain. It's unbelievable; I couldn't believe it's so good. And then this place, it's just amazing here. It's good for Scottish people, it rains a lot here, otherwise it would be like Spain, everything full of houses. But happy to be here.
