  Q. What was it like out there?  People describe it as heaven on earth.
 ERICA SHEPHERD:   It is absolutely heaven on earth.  The first three greens I was actually having to snap myself out of thinking this is a dream.  The weather was a little cold this morning and somehow when we tee off, it's just perfect, like not even cold.  Sun is out.  Beautiful day.  So when you're out here, it's just hard to think that it's real.  And the fact that it is and I am getting to compete at Augusta, it's really special.
 Q. Two years ago, seemed like the golf course itself elevated everyone.  Do you feel that way?
 ERICA SHEPHERD:   Absolutely.  That's why it's Augusta National and that's why the Masters is so special.  I think that you see the same thing with us playing here.  I think that the best player is going to win out here just because of how good the golf course is and how strong the field is.  Yeah, for sure.
 Q. You know a lot of the players; did you ever think as you travel around the country, this traveling road show, that this would be a stop?
 ERICA SHEPHERD:   Absolutely not.  I think that it's awesome for the girls in AJGA and in high school that they can have this to dream about and look forward to.
 Q. I have to ask, we are in Georgia, lots of conversation, Major League Baseball, you re-Tweeted Coach K when he talked about systemic racism, curious if these issues are important to you?
 ERICA SHEPHERD:   Yeah, it's absolutely important to me.  It always is.  But when you're competing tournament week, I try to stay off of social media, stay out of the outside-world stuff and keep my head down.  I'll look at that after this tournament, yeah.
