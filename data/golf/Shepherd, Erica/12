Q. Well done; you just closed out a match to move another round.  How did it go today?
ERICA SHEPHERD: I just hit the ball really solid.  I didn't make as many putts as I'd like to, but I just -- we were all square at the turn, and I just tried to keep my head on straight, and it worked out.
Q. What did you do well today?
ERICA SHEPHERD: My ball-striking was really good today.  I was just hitting everything solid and nothing can go that bad when you're hitting it solid.
Q. Did you hit a lot of greens?
ERICA SHEPHERD: I missed about three greens, I think, three or four, and then I had -- I got every one up-and-down.
Q. Obviously you're playing at -- well, everybody is good at this level, but you knew she was going to give you a good match coming in here, didn't you?
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, she's actually -- one of the tournaments I played in this spring, she won that tournament, so I knew she was a really solid player and I'd have to play my best.
Q. What do you have to do to be ready for this next match?
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, I've played with Yu-Sang a lot, and she's great.  I'll probably have to make some more putts, but just keep hitting greens and fairways, and I'll be fine.
