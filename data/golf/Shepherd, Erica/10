Q. Obviously this is a huge win; how do you feel about the way you played today?
ERICA SHEPHERD: Today I just really had to grind out there.  To start off, I didn't start off too hot --
Q. What do you mean you didn't start off too hot?
ERICA SHEPHERD: Well, I just wasn't hitting it good the first four holes and she was hitting it pretty close.  She wasn't making all her putts, but I was 1-down at one point, and then I hit it in the water two holes in a row, but I still made par, so that was like the entire turning point.
Q. So when you hit the water twice, what were you thinking?
ERICA SHEPHERD: I was just stupid.  One hole I tried to go for it.  It was a good shot.  It was like an inch short of being really good.  But then the next hole I hooked a 3-wood, and I've done that probably four times out here.
Q. What do you have to do to calm yourself down and keep moving?
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, I just kind of -- I actually used like my anger to make me hit good shots.  I never really calmed down.
Q. What did you do well today?  Obviously you had a little hiccup there, but what did you do well?
ERICA SHEPHERD: I just made all the putts that I had to make.  I had some like par putts to tie the holes on the holes I hit in the water, and I made those, and then just -- I just putted really solid.
Q. What do you have to do this afternoon?  Obviously you're kind of starting over again.  What do you have to do?
ERICA SHEPHERD: I'd say if I can just keep focused and not really pay any attention to anything what's going on around me and just make putts and hit the ball solid, I'll be fine.
