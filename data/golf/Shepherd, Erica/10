 Q.  Just talk a little bit about the match you just played and any highlights for each of you.  
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, it was a hard-fought match.  We had some good birdies, didn't make -- when you make bogeys during four-ball, that's not very good.  Then we got past that, and we had three birdies in a row, 8, 9 and 10, and the chip-in on 9, I think that was really the turning point where we knew we had good control of the match.   
 Q.  Any different approach when you're playing two matches in one day?  
MEGAN FURTNEY: Honestly, not really.  I think it helped a lot playing that second match, just already kind of having awareness of where the pins are and knowing how certain shots might roll off of different ridges, and to play those I think really helped us out a lot out there.   
 Q.  Anything with the weather?  Obviously you guys are used to it where you're from, but it's not what you expect out of Southern California.  
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, I mean, I definitely didn't prepare clothes-wise, but I think we're used to it.  Didn't feel too cold, and I think more mental toughness is what got us through the day.   
 Q.  What's the game plan for tomorrow?  
MEGAN FURTNEY: Go out and make some putts, make some good birdies, and hope for the best.   
 Q.  What about tonight?  
ERICA SHEPHERD: Tonight we're going to have our dads bring us back dinner and we're going to go to sleep.   
MEGAN FURTNEY: Maybe throw in some homework if we have some time.
