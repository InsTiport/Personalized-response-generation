Q. Was it a tough day?
ERICA SHEPHERD: It kind of was.  I started off -- front nine I was 2-down, wasn't really hitting it as solid as I had been, so I was kind of down, but then at the turn I kind of regrouped and won the first hole, and I was on a roll ever since.
Q. The rain came on the 15th hole and you got hammered pretty hard, but then you did something on 15 that maybe some people wouldn't expect, and that was --
ERICA SHEPHERD: So it started pouring at 15 and then I made a birdie on that hole.
Q. How long was your putt?
ERICA SHEPHERD: It was about 20 feet.
Q. So that gave you a little momentum.  At that point how did you stand?
ERICA SHEPHERD: So that putt made me go 2-up with three to play.
Q. And were you feeling really good about closing this thing out?
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, I was.  16, I mean, yeah, I love the last three holes, so I didn't really have any doubt.
Q. Tomorrow just what do you have to do to go into tomorrow's round?
ERICA SHEPHERD: Oh, I play one of my -- I girl I played on the Wyndham Cup with last week.  She's a really good player.  I think if I just keep on hitting it solid, and my putting has kept on getting better, so if it can keep on getting better, I'll be fine.
