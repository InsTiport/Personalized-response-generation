Q. How did the round go out there today?
ERICA SHEPHERD: It was good.  The front nine was super shaky.  I was way more nervous than I was expecting to be.  I don't think I've been that nervous since I played in the U.S. Open when I was 15, so I wasn't really expecting that, but as soon as I calmed down and got comfortable, made a lot of birdies and played a lot better.
Q. How was that first tee shot?
ERICA SHEPHERD: First tee shot was fine.  It was mainly on the greens where I was super nervous.  But yeah, I think it was a good course and good conditions today.
Q. How was the Chairman's dinner last night?
ERICA SHEPHERD: It was awesome.  We were at Augusta and it was like 6:00 PM.  There was nobody out there.  The sun was out, like just setting.  It didn't even feel real.  It was so cool.
Q. Are you excited to go on Friday?
ERICA SHEPHERD: I am, and hopefully Saturday.
