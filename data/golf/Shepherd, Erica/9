 Q.  What kind of was different for you guys today?  
ERICA SHEPHERD: We just didn't get the birdie putts falling like we had been.  I don't know, I just kind of ran out of juice as far as making the long birdie putts, so that was unfortunate.  The team we played will probably do good in the rest of this thing.   
 Q.  It's a long week in general, and you played late yesterday, then back on the range early this morning.  How were you feeling when you woke up as far as your stamina?  
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, physically I feel great.  I never really get tired playing golf.  I don't think that was an issue.  Maybe mentally but definitely not physically.   
 Q.  What's next for you?  
ERICA SHEPHERD: I have the Thunderbird and then straight to the U.S. Open.   
 Q.  How will you prep for the Women's Open?  
ERICA SHEPHERD: First I'm going to get through all my finals and get that off my mental plate, and then playing courses at longer distances, just trying to find the longest rough I can to chip out of and stuff.  Yeah, that'll get me ready.   
 Q.  You guys are exempt next year into this.  Will that be kind of on your radar?  
ERICA SHEPHERD: Yeah, for sure.
