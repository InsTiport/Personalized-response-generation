Q.  How was it finding out about the late start and all that?
RAYMOND FLOYD:  Well, it was early, and it was fine.  I haven't seen conditions like this, obviously.  I played late Thursday, I know the boys that played early Thursday had conditions like this.  They were very benign.  I think you might have been able to take advantage here this morning.  But I made all pars, so everything is fine.
Q.  How is the conditions this morning?
RAYMOND FLOYD:  Oh, they're beautiful.  Perfect.  Yeah.
