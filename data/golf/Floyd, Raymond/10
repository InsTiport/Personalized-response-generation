Q.
Talk about your round?
RAYMOND FLOYD:  Well, it was pretty good the first nine.  And then the back I 3 putted 10 and I made    I missed every putt literally from there in and didn't play as well either.
Q.  Did the course conditions play any affect?
RAYMOND FLOYD:  Yeah.  The greens were bumpier after all the play on them.

And it got windy and the pin positions were difficult.
Q.  How do you feel that the delay this morning affected anything at all?
RAYMOND FLOYD:  Well, it always has an effect, but you have to deal with those things.
