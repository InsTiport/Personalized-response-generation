 Q.  (Recording in progress.)  
RICKY CASTILLO: Well, I got to the job done.  It wasn't pretty.  I definitely didn't play to my standard as I did the last couple days.  I had a little bit more pressure than I did.   
So, I mean, I did get the job done, but didn't get it done the way I wanted to.  Definitely had more chances out there.  In the end, I'm still going on to tomorrow.   
 Q.  How long was your putt for birdie there on...  
RICKY CASTILLO: Probably about 20, 20 feet.   
 Q.  20 feet?  
RICKY CASTILLO: Yeah.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on moving forward then after today?  
RICKY CASTILLO: Just know that tomorrow we're back in the same position.  Starting on the same hole, or starting on the 1st hole we're all square.  It's not like I'm starting behind or ahead or anything like that.  It's just a brand new match.   
Just relax and refocus going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  Forgive me, how old are you?  
RICKY CASTILLO: 17.   
 Q.  And what grade are you going into?  
RICKY CASTILLO: I'm going to be a senior next year.   
 Q.  At what high school?  
RICKY CASTILLO: Valencia High School.   
 Q.  And do you have a history in this event?  
RICKY CASTILLO: Yes.  I played here last year and made it to the round of 16.   
 Q.  So big turning point at 13, 14 and got the match back to all square.  Tell me a little bit about those holes.  
RICKY CASTILLO: Yeah, just got two good up and downs and he made a couple bogeys and gave me a couple chances.   
Then on 16 I had 15 feet for birdie, two-putt to win the hole, and three-putted.   
And then kind of struggled on the last four or five holes coming in where I could have closed it.  I mean, I got the job done, but just not way I wanted to do it.   
 Q.  Past experience in this help you when you have to go to extra holes like that?  
RICKY CASTILLO: Yeah, definitely.  I went to extra holes last year.  It was only one hole last year, but it's just experience.  You know you're going to eventually go to extra holes.  You just got to keep knowing that you're still playing the same game; they're in the same position you are.   
So it's good.
