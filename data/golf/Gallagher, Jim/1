Q.   Can you tell me about your round today?
JIM GALLAGHER, JR.:   I played pretty good.   Yesterday I brought it back and finished terrible and today I felt like I needed to get it, my goal was to get it to 1‑under for the tournament.   Whatever that took.   And I got a little squirrely on, I guess 5, made a great bogey there. 
And then birdied a couple holes, three out of the next four holes.   So got on a pretty good roll.   Bogeyed 10.   And just made a good birdie at 11, in basically the best thing is I've been telling my daughter, she's playing college golf and they're at the NCAA's this week and I said when you get nervous you got to slow down.   And that anxiety comes in there and you just get kind of sped up. 
And I noticed that I bogeyed 14, I started to say, slow down, practice what you preach.   And I did get back right in there and play aggressive.   And then I finished with a great birdie on 18 and topped it off with 9‑under.   So I'm pretty proud of that and snuck right up there and have a chance on the weekend. 

Q.   What were the main differences between yesterday's round and today?
JIM GALLAGHER, JR.:   Just I didn't drive it that well yesterday.   I drove it a lot better today and I made some putts.   I made a couple long putts that I haven't been making, so that's probably the biggest difference.   And I stayed a lot more aggressive today. 
Yesterday I got to guiding it and not playing like I need to be playing.   The weather was better.   Yesterday was tough, we played that back nine first and we kind of got the bad end on that draw to start on that nine, because that's a little tougher nine.   But I brought it back and I let it get away and I was so mad, but it's okay.
