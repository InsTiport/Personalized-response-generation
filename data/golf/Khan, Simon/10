Q.   Great championship, you went so close, what is it about this place that you like? 
SIMON KHAN:   Just all loved the course.   Sort of fits my eye and different shots, and you know, when I'm playing well, that's my strength. 

Q.   Did you think when Manny mixed it up on 18 and pulled out a driver and got it down there a long way, did you think you should do the same?
SIMON KHAN:   I did hit driver in regulation, and you know, a cut driver for me, I don't mind hitting it just sort of   ‑‑   Marc Warren's one put me off a little bit.   I thought it was playing a bit shorter. 
I actually felt quite good over that second shot, because I thought I've got a longer yardage and it's perfect for a rescue and maybe just squared a little bit at the bottom and just come up short because I've been going long with rescue.

Q.   How disappointed are you? 
SIMON KHAN:   I'm disappointed, yeah.   I'm desperate to win this again, and last time it felt a bit surreal coming back that far back, and Luke having the bad last hole.   I wanted to prove to myself, as well, I've got it in me, and that's been the great thing today.   I've played great. 

Q.   What about the positives you can take out of this? 
SIMON KHAN:   Well, just like I say, after such a long layoff, to come back and lose in a playoff of this fantastic tournament, I can take a lot out of it definitely.   I'm delighted for Matteo.   He was great and he was great in the playoff.   I knew he would be a tough customer and he proved it. 
I would have loved to have won this tournament again, it's such a great event, and for the Tour and for the sponsors.   It's just amazing crowds today and the weather came out.   Yeah, I played great today. 
Didn't really miss a shot on my normal round and then on the playoff‑‑ funny, I've been struggling with the tee shot a little bit all week on 18.   Trying to sort of hit a cut driver and take some off it and then I sort of stuck with 3‑wood in the end.   I quite fancied that last shot because it was a perfect sort of number, if I hit a good, solid rescue, to pitch front part of the green, which is what you need to do on that hole. 
But yeah, I desperately wanted to win, and you know, and Matteo did, so it's just one of those things.   I've won in one playoff and lost one now, but I'm delighted for Matteo.   He's a great lad.   I think he'll go a long way.

Q.   2010 was the year you won it; you wrote off your chances when you finished a little earlier, but it was almost a similar scenario. 
SIMON KHAN:   Yeah, it really was dÃ©jÃ  vu.   I thought this is exactly the same, warming up on the range.   I felt great going into the playoff.   Just a shame that second shot didn't carry another couple of yards, and probably would be going back out to 18 again. 

Q.   I know that shot is going it live with you, but is it easier to bear knowing that you've gone this distance in a playoff against such a prodigious talent? 
SIMON KHAN:   Definitely.   Neither of us hit a bad shot there, so you know, I hit a couple of really good rescues right down the pin.   Obviously being a bit nearer, I felt I had to take some off him, and I thought the third extra hole, I had my chance there, but he held a great putt.   He stood up there and knocked it in when he knows I'm going to make four, so that was good. 
Just didn't happen for me, but I've just got to, it's just a start.   I just want to carry this on now, and I can't be‑‑ when I look back at it tomorrow, I'm sure I won't be too disappointed what I've done. 

Q.   Nicely up in the money and rankings; onwards and upwards. 
SIMON KHAN:   Definitely.   It's been a tough couple of years since probably winning the tournament.   I felt after the end of 2010, I just sort of maybe switched off a little bit and took it‑‑ you reach one of your main goals to win this tournament, which are always in my mind, and I've learnt from that and I don't want to make that mistake again and the focus is here to stay.
