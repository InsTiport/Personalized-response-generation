 Q.   Some excellent numbers on the scorecard.   Give us a sense of how you compiled them?  
SIMON KHAN:   Yeah, it was a solid round really.   I had a couple of bogeys, but I started well.   The wind was up early on.   We were playing the front nine so we were playing the right way around.   
Yeah, I played really nicely at the beginning.   Dropped one on the fifth hole but apart from that, the rest of the round was all very good.   Still plays tough, although the rough's not up this year.   If you miss fairways and the fairways are obviously firm, there's not much control into the greens.   Still a really good test.  
   
 Q.   You struggled with injury for quite some time.   Give us a sense of where you are with that.   
SIMON KHAN:   Still ongoing.   I'm not just saying that, it is really, yeah, sort of a lot of ice after the rounds on knees and shoulders and it's just been a really, really frustrating year.   I've had this knee done before and recovered a lot quicker than I did this time.  
The weather helps and the heat and sort of flattish course, so that all helps.   Yeah, it's gradually getting there.   It's just been a long process.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever considered it careerâ€‘threatening?   Is it the sort of thing where you think:   I might not overcome this?  
SIMON KHAN:   Shoulder certainly, shoulders are very temperamental if you get the surgery on them.   I'm just trying to manage that as best I can, and I'd rather not have the surgery; I'm 43 now.   Days like today, I still enjoy playing and love doing it, love trying to improve.   Yeah, I'm going to keep going.
