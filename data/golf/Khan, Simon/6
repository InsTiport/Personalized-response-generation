 Q.   Tight match all the way through, never more than one hole; is a halve a fair result do you think?   
SIMON KHAN:   It was a really tight game.   We knew it was going to be tough against the two Italian guys.   They are both so consistent and many holed some nice putts there.   Yeah, there's a point around the turn where, yeah, many holed a bunker shot on 9 and then I missed a short one on 10 for birdie, and that was sort of a bit of a turning point.   Then they got a head and we got a head and it really was moving around a bit.   
On the last there, we knew we needed a birdie.   Paul hit a great drive.   Disappointed with my wedge.   I was just trying to hold it in there a little and spun it off.   A little bit disappointed in the end, because felt we should have closed it out there really.   But you know, we played well, so that's the main thing.  
   
 Q.   Your first experience of Seve Trophy; how would you describe the experience overall, everything that's going on?   
SIMON KHAN:   It's been great, yeah, loving it, really enjoying it.   Paul is a really good partner, obviously experienced in The Ryder Cup so that helped today.   
I think if we had just holed a few more putts, it could have gone our way.   Paul hit the hole quite a few times, and I had a few chances I missed.   But no, great experience.   Sam's been great, and looking forward to the rest of the week.
