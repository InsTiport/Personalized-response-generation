  SIMON KHAN:   Not great, no.   It's been niggling and been there all week really, my hip and lower back.   But the physio has been good and I've obviously played quite well the first two days.   
Sam gave me a rest this morning and I just went down to the range to warm up for this afternoon, and after 20 balls, it just literally, it's the worst it's been.   
So you're in a situation where playing individually, it's a different story.   During the tournament, you obviously go and play and try and get around, but the main thing is the team and I'm devastated, I'm absolutely gutted because I know that of all the formats, foursomes, I love playing it, I always have.   I love the pressure of it and the fact that you've got to hit fairways and greens, so I'm unfortunately not going to be able to play this afternoon.  
But to speak to Sam, luckily I got a hold of him before he put the teams in, and, yeah, so go out and support the boys.  
   
 Q.   But you rest, you try to get some extra treatment and you'll be fine for singles?   
SIMON KHAN:   I hope so, yeah.   Yeah, I mean, like I say, yesterday, first day, I felt the best I've felt.   Yesterday I wasn't quite so good.   But I still felt I can play and it wasn't so good off the tee but I was still contributing and felt fine to play but the day‑‑ you've got to be honest with Sam and the team and that's the main thing.   Touch wood, I'll be all right for tomorrow, yeah.
