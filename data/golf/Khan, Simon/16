 Q. Simon, how enjoyable was that round?
 SIMON KHAN: Yeah, it was great. Didn't play that great on my front nine, the back nine, but really got it going on the front nine, and yeah, holed a sort of lob-wedge from 72 yards for a 2, and that helps. 

 Q. How about your season? 
 SIMON KHAN: On the whole, disappointing so far. Slow start as normal. And then played better during the summer, really, without really putting four round together and putting well, apart from the French Open. Got a new putter this week and that feels a bit better, rolling it quite well today.

 Q. Because of your exemption of winning the PGA, you are exempt through 2015, so in a way because you're not having a great season and the 115 is not there, is that almost a disadvantage?
 SIMON KHAN: People say after I won, that the pressure is off, but you need the pressure. That's why we play the game so you want to be in that position. 
 So yeah, I think towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year, kind of maybe switched off a bit mentally but I feel, you know, got my goals back on now and feel good for the rest of the year hopefully.

 Q. Give yourself a chance this week?
 SIMON KHAN: Yeah, hope so. Played well here before, couple of years ago, it was going really well after two days and I like the course, suits my eye and enjoy playing here.
