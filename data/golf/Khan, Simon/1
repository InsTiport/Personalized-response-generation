Q. Good round out there today, how was it for you?
SIMON KHAN: Yeah, I played really well today.  Starting out I felt conditions were possibly a bit tougher.  I mean, it died down, the wind but it's got back up now actually.  It's still scorable and you know the scoring is good.  You know you have to make birdies and go for it a bit.
I played great today and yeah, it didn't really do anything wrong.  Took advantage of a good shot into 17 and 3-iron and holed the putt for about 12-foot.  I played the front nine well, which is getting a little bit tougher.  The tee is up on 7 but made a good birdie there.  Hit it close there, about two foot.
A shame, had a good chance at the last to shoot 63 which would have been lovely, but all in all, delighted how I played.
Q. A bogey-free round, as well.  That must be another good thing?
SIMON KHAN: Yeah, it's always nice to do that.  There's not much rough but when you do hit it into the rough, sometimes you get a flyer and sometimes you don't.  It's quite hard to judge, especially when there's a bit more wind about.  I felt I did that well today.  I may be used a bit of experience out there, certain times, and to know when to hit the right shot and when not to go for it.  Yeah, really, really pleased.
Q. I know you said there's not much rough but did the rain last night have anything to do with it?
SIMON KHAN: No, I mean, the rain probably made it a little bit easier in places.  I know the greens are holding anyway but yeah, I think the rain, the course is in decent shape now, so it's fine.
