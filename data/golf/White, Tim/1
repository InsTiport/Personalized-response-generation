  Q. Talk about the course first of all.   
 TIM WHITE: The course is very wet. It's very wet. The ball's not going forward at all. Everything's pretty much, when you hit it off the tee, it's pretty much where it's going to stay. The greens are good, it's just wet. It's casual water everywhere.   
  
  Q. Give us an overview of your play today.   
 TIM WHITE: I really didn't hit it too bad. When I did hit a bad shot I got penalized. I had three double bogeys and shot 78. But other than that this is my first time at this and I'm pleased.  
  
  Q. So you're happy with it?  
 TIM WHITE: I am very happy.
