 Q. 68 out there with no wind. Tell me about the golf course. 
 TROY MATTESON: Right now it's scorable. A lot of guys are able to get shots in there close, and the greens aren't too terribly fast so you've got a chance to make some putts out there. But the golf course, this is ideal scoring conditions for this course, and you know, we probably won't see them again. I hope the next three days are like this.

 Q. Is this one of those in conditions like this you walk off and go, 4-under, okay, cool, I like where I'm at right now; or is it one where you walk off and go, 4-under, man, I could have shot 8?
 TROY MATTESON: For me I'll take under par on this track any time. It's that simple. 17 wasn't too hard today. Obviously there's not a 10-mile-an-hour wind. There's almost none. A lot of guys are going to hit it in there close, and it's a little less stressful. But when that wind kicks up, your finish is tough on this course.

 Q. When you get to that 17th tee, even when there's no wind and it's 124 yards, you're looking around going, man, why are people being quiet?
 TROY MATTESON: Yeah, actually that's what I thought coming up 16 today. I was like, man, they're not being rowdy over there or anything. Everyone is probably hitting it close today, and it's the hardest 124-yard shot in golf right now.

 Q. How long did that ball seem to hang in the air when you hit that shot?
 TROY MATTESON: I think it's still up there somewhere. That's for sure. When you let it go, you just hope you look up and you see that thing on the green.
