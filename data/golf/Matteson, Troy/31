  Q.  First time Masters participant.   
 TROY MATTESON:  Terrible.  Wasn't nervous.  Hit a lot of bad shots.  You do this on this golf course.  It's pretty painful.  I hit a lot of bad shots.  It's a bitter golf course.  It's going to make a tough week.   
 When you miss a shot you get severely penalized.  It does reward some good shots.   
 Have played the course before.  It's what is expected, maybe a little firmer.   
 Sometimes a good shot is good and a bad shot's bad.  That's Augusta.
