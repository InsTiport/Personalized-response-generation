 Q.  Congratulations, Saturday known as moving day.  You make a big move with a 5-under 65 to get it to 9-under for the tournament. 
 TROY MATTESON:  Yeah, that was a good round for me out here today.  Usually if I can get 2 or 3 I feel pretty good on this course, but any time you can get more than 4 you're doing really well out here, so I'm very proud of that. 

 Q.  It's not just the fact that you made birdies, no bogeys, no squares on that scoring sheet, nothing but circles. 
 TROY MATTESON:  I got away with a few out there today, and that's what you've got to do to play well out here.  You've got to get some up-and-downs, you've got to get some balls out from under the trees and make some pars, and that's the name of the game out here. 

 Q.  A classy birdie at the 18th, you splashed it out from that front bunker. 
 TROY MATTESON:  That worked out pretty good.  Usually nobody likes those long bunker shots, those long 30-yarders, but that one worked out pretty good. 

 Q.  How has the course changed from Thursday into the weekend? 
 TROY MATTESON:  I think it's starting to firm up a little bit.  I think you're seeing some longer drives out there.  The wind is a little bit more variable.  We're seeing different winds that we have in the last two years.  But I think as it dries out, it's going to be pretty interesting for tomorrow. 

 Q.  How has the Hawai'i experience been?  Anything fun this week? 
 TROY MATTESON:  For me coming to Hawai'i is always fun.  There's always stuff to do, great restaurants, there's great things to do around the hotel, and it's just -- we're really lucky that we get to start here in Hawai'i.
