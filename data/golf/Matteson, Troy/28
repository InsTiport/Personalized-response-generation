 Q.  Nice round.  10 is a decent number to be at. 
 TROY MATTESON:  I think so.  For me, and not playing for four weeks before this and having a back injury and this being my first tournament back, I'll take 10-under. 

 Q.  So what made it so good today? 
 TROY MATTESON:  You know, I just hit a lot of good quality shots today.  Made a few putts early, made a long putt on the back nine on the par 3, which really helped out because that ball was screaming by the hole.  And then just kept it together coming in.  I bogeyed the last, but I'll take it. 

 Q.  How much leaderboard watching do you do?  You were tied for second there for a while? 
 TROY MATTESON:  You know, I probably was at one point, but out here it's going to be a horse race.  You can't get too carried away looking at the scoreboard because it's a real horse race out here, and you've just got to keep going on your own game and just really focus on making a lot of birdies.  As you can see, I think I glanced there at the end, and Nathan is probably 16 or so, and I would expect him to go lower, even by the end of the day.  So it's going to take a low one tomorrow. 

 Q.  Do you like your chances? 
 TROY MATTESON:  I'll take it after not playing for four weeks.
