 Q. Throwing out birdies on 10 and 11 in your second round. Just on fire. 11, I don't know if you're supposed to make birdie there. 
 TROY MATTESON: Yeah. I don't think I've ever made birdie there, so it felt good to get one this morning. Of course, Tim and I both started out birdie, birdie this morning, so it was nice to be in a group where we made a bunch of birdies right off the bat. 
 And after that just kind of settled down for a little bit and didn't make really any mistakes, and then made a couple more on part of the front side. But it was a good day all in all. Real easy Friday for me. 

 Q. Tell me about the way the golf course is playing today after that deluge of rain in the first round. 
 TROY MATTESON: There are a few spots out there where you can take release on the fairways. There's not many. 
 The rough seems to be holding up pretty good, and the bunkers are holding up good and the greens are really holding up well. Actually I was surprised how good they were yesterday. The greens really drain well out here. 
 I think as the week goes on, if we can just not get a whole lot of rain, or not much more rain, it will be okay.

 Q. A solid round in good conditions, what do you see for the afternoon? We're supposed to get more rain. Will that make the golf course tougher?
 TROY MATTESON: I think just a little bit of rain right now is going to bring the conditions back to being just no release on the fairway. And it's still going to soften up those greens. 
 Right now it's saturated out there. So even the tiniest bit of rain is going to make it tough for the guys. 

 Q. Troy, good playing. Thanks much. 
 TROY MATTESON: Thank you.
