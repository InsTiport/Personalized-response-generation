   MARC VANDE BROEK: If a player doesn't end up on time, which was 12:00 in this case, the player loses the first hole. If the player comes five minutes late, then she loses the match. But we have to wait those five minutes. 
 So what she did is in between 12:00 and the five minutes is she conceded the match, so the match wasn't played and won by Europe (Indiscernible). So the rules say, if you're on time, and in the captain's agreement they use a local rule which is in the book, saying you can have five minutes but then you lose the hole. If you're over five minutes, you're disqualified. 

 Q. We'll clear it up right now. 
 MARC VANDE BROEK: Yeah, I explained that on the first tee very clear to the assistant captain and as well as to the European ones and the group of players on the tee. 
 The European player came on the tee before 12 o'clock, then it became 12, and I said to I think it was the assistant captain, I told her, well, we wait five minutes, if she's not showing up, then the match is not played because the player is not there at the tee, or she concedes the match within five minutes, which she did.

 Q. That's in the Solheim rules as well? 
 MARC VANDE BROEK: I think it's in the local rules. You can use the local rule. So you're given those five minutes. We have to have that local rule. We have that on Tour, the American Tour has that. But in the captain's agreement, that's mentioned as well.
