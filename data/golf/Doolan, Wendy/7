 WENDY DOOLAN: Well, you can see by the scores the conditions are tough. The course is
playing long; the wind is tricky. A lot of the longer holes are into the wind, too; so
that is also a little bit difficult. I think it was more difficult picking clubs today
because it really is swirling and amongst trees, things like that, it was hard to get the
right number into the green. 
 I was just trying to get it in the fairway and then doing my best to get it on the
green and give myself a chance with my putts. 
 Things have been coming together. Everything seems to be going pretty well at the
moment. I have been working hard on all parts of my game, and they all seem to be getting
a little bit better. Everything seems to be moving in the right direction at the moment. 
 I am just pretty much doing the same thing that I did last year. I am just hopefully
getting better at it. 
 Is this going to be the year? I have no determination in that. I am just doing my best
every week. 
 I think it is great for golf. I think it is great for men's and women's golf. There are
so many different countries competing on the same tours these days. And at the end of the
day, you want to compete against the best in the world, and the best in the world doesn't
always come from one country. I think everybody is competing to their highest level
because the best players get the opportunity to compete on this Tour.
