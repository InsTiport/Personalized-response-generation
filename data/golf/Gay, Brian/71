Q.  You've got one Top 10 this year at the Honda Classic.  Maybe talk about that week, which you did particularly well, you had four rounds in the 60s that week.  The conditions were low scoring kind of like this.  It sounds like it might be a good week for you this week as well.
BRIAN GAY: (Inaudible) Florida, obviously the Honda (inaudible), I've played this course a lot.  I played here in junior golf (inaudible).

Q.  Is this course well suited to your game?
BRIAN GAY: Actually, not really.  Most people think it's more of a big hitter course, par 5s (inaudible).

Q.  How would you explain it not being suited to you?
BRIAN GAY: You know, Nicholas courses, I like a lot of his courses, not being a long hitter you can still (inaudible) get a lot of birdie opportunities.

Q.  Not much difference since you shot the tournamentÃ ¹s two day total record two years ago?
BRIAN GAY: Similarities?  It's usually about the same here every year.  There is a couple where the greens get firm and dry and kind of brown.  There is some wet spots in the fairways, I had a few balls on the front nine this morning, in the if you hit a brown spot it runs 30 or 40 (inaudible).

BRIAN GAY: (Inaudible).

Q.  Anything else?  Thank you very much, Brian.
