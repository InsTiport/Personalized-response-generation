  Q. Brian, do you know you've already won twice here this week with your two kids?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah. We had a good time yesterday. It's good to see tonight how they ended up, but yeah, it was fun getting out there with them.  
  
  Q. I'm sure they're going to love it. Now, good start for you opening round, 67, -5. Anything in particular went really right that you thought was kind of the key to the round?  
 BRIAN GAY: Well, I birdied all the par-5s, which was good. It's always nice to do that. Drove the ball -- I hit a bunch of fairways. Didn't hit my irons particularly well, but really just birdied all the par-5s. And I hit a 5-iron for a tap in on one hole. So just one bogey.  
  
  Q. How about this time of the year? I know it's a great family week for you with the kids, but as far as focus, easier to focus knowing it's the last official event or a little bit harder?  
 BRIAN GAY: A little bit harder till you get out there, you know, and you try to get in your right mindset. But there's a few more distractions, a lot of stuff going on. We got family at the house, but it's not too bad once you get out there.  
  
  Q. A thought about Veteran's Day. You have a military background with your father and where you grew up. Give me a thought about what it means to you on a day like today to compete knowing your family and their influence on you.   
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah. I grew up an Army brat, and my dad served 22-odd years in the Army, and in Korea twice. So yeah, great to honor those guys.   
 They had a big deal at my girl's school. I wasn't able to go this morning. My wife went and checked it out, and she said it was really good.  
  
  Q. Well, listen, great start. Good luck the rest of the way?  
 BRIAN GAY: Thanks. Appreciate it.
