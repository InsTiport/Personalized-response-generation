 Q.   You played your way into contention.   Tell us what happened.   
BRIAN GAY:   That's the first ball I really putted from kind of in the short rough.   Just off the fringe there all week and I was trying to make it, and I just got a little too aggressive.   It looked a little more uphill to me up by the cup there.   
But the second birdie putt I would never hit over, I hit a perfect putt, just two balls out.   
   
 Q.   Were you at all aware of where you were on the leaderboard?   Did you watch the leaderboard at all?   Were you trying to play conservative or aggressive based upon what you saw happening?  
BRIAN GAY:   I was trying to stay aggressive.   I kind of had people chatting between holes telling me, oh, you're tied or whatever, but I never really looked.   
I was trying to stay aggressive.   I just got it above the hole a couple times back there up against the mountains.   I had some tough putts to make up there.
