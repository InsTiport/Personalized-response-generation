 Q.   3‑under 67 for 12‑under.   Your thoughts on today.  
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah.   Nice way to finish here.   I made two good putts on 16 and 17.   Played a pretty good Back 9.   Disappointed not to get a birdie there on 15, but it was a good solid week.  
   
 Q.   Now, you're the complete world traveller.   You're going to do four continents in four weeks.   How are you feeling?  
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah.   I've never done that before.   I'm still not sleeping great after two weeks in Asia, but looking forward to heading down to Mexico, go home for a day and then head down there.  
   
 Q.   Must be feeling good about your game then?  
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah, solid.   I finally had a good solid putting week.   Putting's my strength and it's been a bit of a struggle lately, so it's nice to see some putts go in.
