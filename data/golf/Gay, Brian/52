 Q. You get on a roll like you did today, does it disappoint you to have to stop?
 BRIAN GAY: No, I'm worn out. I'm ready to go home.

 Q. Talk about the 13th hole, par-3. I know you couldn't see it from the tee, but the crowd noise pretty much gave you an idea?
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, it looked like it maybe caught a piece of the hole and rolled right over the edge. It was a good cut 5-iron in there.

 Q. How is the putting? You're always one of the top putters around and coming up clutch again today. 
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, putting has come around this week. It's been a little bit of a struggle the last month or so. I haven't been making too much. But I rolled in a few today. 

 Q. A little disappointed you have to come out and play a couple holes tomorrow morning, too?
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, it would have been nice to finish but the fog kind of did us in today, so another early morning tomorrow. 

 Q. What are you looking forward to tomorrow? 
 BRIAN GAY: Just coming out and playing some more good golf. Just got to be patient out there. There's a lot of long par-4s and you've just got to be patient. 

 Q. As you pull yourself into contention like you did today, do you scoreboard watch, get an idea of where some of the other guys are and where you're sitting?
 BRIAN GAY: Not really. Sometimes I see them by accident, but I try not to really pay attention. It doesn't really matter at this point. You've just got to take care of business while you're out there.

 Q. Speaking of being tired, what will you do tonight besides sleep to reenergize yourself for tomorrow?
 BRIAN GAY: I'm just going to go lay down and watch the Gators play tonight and just chill out and try to get a little bit of rest.
