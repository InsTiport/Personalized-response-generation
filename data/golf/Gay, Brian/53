  Q. Can you just tell me about your round today and how the course is playing?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, pretty pleased. A good start. It's awful difficult golf course and I got off to a good start, got a couple under early and made a bunch of pars all day and bogey there at the end but pretty pleased.  
  
  Q. How difficult is it kind of stopping when you're kind of in a groove and then going back out there?  
 BRIAN GAY: It's tough. We get in and of course we were just about finished, we just had a hole left.   
 So it's tough to try to go back out and try to warm-up.  
  
  Q. Especially 18 is?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, that's not the one you want to come back to.   
  
  Q. What do you expect tomorrow, same conditions?  
 BRIAN GAY: I think the weather is supposed be to be good, so maybe it will be a little bit softer tomorrow morning and maybe I can get a little closer on the approach shots.
