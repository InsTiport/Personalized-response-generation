   NELSON SILVERIO:  A 67 today, seems like you were playing  a different course than everybody else, a low round.  Why don't you talk about conditions out there and just comment on your round in general.   
 BRIAN GAY:  He yeah, pretty happy with it.  It was obviously very windy, and just tried to make pars on the tough holes and try it take advantage of some of the easier ones.   
  
  Q.  What was it that was really working for you?  It seems like your irons were pretty spot on.   
 BRIAN GAY:  I drove it good, hit it good for the most part.  You know, got to keep it out of the bushes here is the big thing, keep it out of the hazards and the greens are so good, surface is perfect, so if you hit it on line, you'll make it.   
  
  Q.  Is that a continuation of yesterday for you?  Your score is pretty much right there but obviously today in he relation to the rest of field it's a lot better than everybody else.  Is it just a progression?   
 BRIAN GAY:  Yeah, I played pretty similar.  I made like seven birdies yesterday and had a couple 3-putts.  It was obviously harder to make birdies today.   
  
  Q.  What was the last tournament you led after 36 or right up there?  It's been a while.   
 BRIAN GAY:  I was close here last year after two rounds.  But I was right there at Tampa and I was right there at Memphis.   
  
  Q.  Did those experiences bode well for you for the weekend?   
 BRIAN GAY:  Yeah, I think the more you can put yourself in that position, the more you know how to handle it.   
  
  Q.  Any change to this place from last year to this year?   
 BRIAN GAY:  It's the same, it's great.   
 NELSON SILVERIO:  Thanks, Brian.
