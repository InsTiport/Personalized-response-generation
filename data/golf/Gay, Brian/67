BRIAN GAY:  I hit it off the tee and got over there in the hazard, took a drop, made a good 5.
Q.  It looked like you were thinking about not taking a drop and trying to play it.  You spent a lot of time looking.
BRIAN GAY:  Yeah, well, where I had to drop I was behind the tree and I had to hit a big hook with a left-to-right wind and I thought I could blast it down the fairway and get a clear shot, but I didn't think I should try it.

I was sinking in the mud and there were too many weeds in my backswing.
Q.  Obviously it was a very tough day for conditions and you had it to second alone there coming in.  Was it just the conditions that were making it so tough today?
BRIAN GAY:  Yeah, it was obviously very tough.  I hung in there pretty good and got to actually feeling somewhat comfortable on the back even though it was playing real difficult and I was hitting a lot of good shots.

I hit a bad 3-wood and a bad 4-wood and not the finish I wanted.
Q.  Still a pretty good week's work, though?
BRIAN GAY:  Yeah, no question.
