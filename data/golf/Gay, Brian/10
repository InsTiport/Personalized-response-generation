 Q.  Brian, four in a row to close for a 67.  Great round.  Great showing this week.  
BRIAN GAY: Yeah, thanks.  It was a good solid week.  I felt like the first couple of days I made kind of some stupid bogeys that I really shouldn't have made.  But I knew I was playing pretty good.   
And started today with a birdie, birdie start.  And then birdied the last four.  Caught a couple really good putts in the middle of the round that lipped out.  And just -- I was just right on the edge of having a really good round, but played pretty well.   
 Q.  You won here in 2009, had a lot of success at this course early.  Last few years not so much.  Is it anything that you found this week again here at Harbour Town?  
BRIAN GAY: No, I think the combination of being hurt and then having two surgeries and being out a year and a half and coming back, it's been tougher than I thought.  Kind of slow, and not playing every week.   
It's always good to come back somewhere where I've got some good memories.  I love this golf course.  It's my favorite golf course on Tour.  It's kind of the consensus of everybody.  They love this golf course.  It's really, really good.   
 Q.  A lot of positives to carry from this week the rest of the year.  Talk about your goals for the year.  
BRIAN GAY: Yeah, it feels good to finish it off today like that with four birdies in a row.  I'm looking to carry that into next week and got a week off after that.  But I'd love to get back in the winner's circle.
