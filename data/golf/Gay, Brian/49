 Q. Solid playing, four birdies, no bogeys. It's always nice to have a clean card and be 10-under par headed into the final round. 
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, another good round for me, a little less stress out there today without any bogeys, and I only had to make a couple saves. I had quite a few saves I had to make yesterday to keep my round going, so it was nice to kind of ease around there.

 Q. Help me out here because I'm recalling from memory but I think you have one bogey in the first round, one in the second, none in the third. You have two bogeys for 54 holes; that is brilliant ball-striking. 
 BRIAN GAY: Thanks, yeah. I've been keeping it in the fairway for the most part, which is a big key out here as thick as the rough is this year, so I've been driving it nicely.

 Q. You say keeping it in the fairway. You've hit 31 of 42 fairways. That's No. 1 in the tournament. 
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, thanks. I actually took a peek last night and saw that I was No. 1. I was a little surprised, but I guess I'm driving it good.

 Q. You look at people who have won this tournament, Phil Mickelson, J.B. Holmes. You do not hit the ball as far as those guys, and yet you have wonderful game management that allows you to be in contention. 
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, like I said, the rough is taller this year and they've pinched in a few holes, so it's not quite as much bombs away out here. You've still got to get it in play to score.

 Q. It was mentioned earlier how much the Mayakoba meant to you. You seem to be playing with a lot of confidence and very, very consistently. 
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, it definitely helped me have a great year last year and continued to play well after that win, and I've got off to a great start this year.
