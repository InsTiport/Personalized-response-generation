 Q.   Talk about 12, you had a good drive and I think it was 81 yards.   
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah, 82 or 83, right in the middle of the fairway, 82 or 83 yards, and just a little bit of a cut L‑wedge, and one hop, I think it one‑hopped in.   Couldn't see it from the fairway but landed just in front of the green.   When it hit the green, I said go in, and then they hollered.   Normally that never happens, you yell go in, and they never do.   But.  
   
 Q.   For a TOUR professional like yourself, how often does that happen during the course of the year, couple times a season usually?   Seems like guys make four or five a year and not make any the next year.   
BRIAN GAY:   I haven't had a hole‑in‑one in a long time but I did make‑‑ I wish I could remember.   Getting old; short‑term memory loss.   Holed out somewhere.   Holed out for an eagle, I can't remember.   
   
 Q.   Nice not to have to take your putter out of the bag?  
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah, it's a hole you want to birdie there, and it's nice for it to go in.   It's a good two for me.   I got off to a good start and hit it in the water at 7 and made double and made bogey at 8, so I was struggling.   
Birdie on 11 and hooked it on 12.   Got me to the weekend.
