  Q. Good win today. I would think you're pretty happy with getting through the first round here?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, absolutely. Match against Kenny, obviously everybody knows how good Kenny is. I haven't played match play since my amateur day. A little bit different for me.  
 Started out okay, a little rough patch in the middle, and then probably good the last seven or eight holes.  
  
  Q. How about the mentality since you haven't played this for some time, you kind of know you have to get off to a good start?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, I tried as much as I could just tried to play golf and not worry about what he's doing or how he's doing. But it's tough first time out in match play.  
  
  Q. How does the course setup for you?  
 BRIAN GAY: Not really good at all. It's a long range, brick hard. It's just like throwing a math equation in the fairway, trying to figure out what is uphill, downhill, where to land it, where is it going to release to. So it was a lot of work.  
  
  Q. Seemed like it worked well for you today. Any thoughts oncoming back tomorrow?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, got the first 1-under my belt. Felt maybe a little bit better out there on the golf course today, had some really good iron shots coming in to hang on.  
  
  Q. Any pivotal shot? Any one hole or one shot that was key to the match?  
 BRIAN GAY: Probably I laid it up in the bunker on 11. I had a pitching wedge to two feet. And he was next to hit, but he hit it in there four feet. And then hit a good shot on the par-3, but he missed it right of the green didn't get up-and-down, that kind of got me turned around a little bit.
