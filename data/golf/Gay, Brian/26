 Q. Do you have any idea what it's supposed to do yet?
 BRIAN GAY: No idea, whatsoever. I thought it was sliding right and it went left. A little left and then straight. But I struggled a little bit on the greens today, the putter didn't feel good. I made a couple of putts, but never really got it going.

 Q. It's always nice to get better, with the eagle, and feel like you can build some momentum?
 BRIAN GAY: Absolutely. I putted for eagle two par-5s in a row. I don't remember the last time I did that. I made a nice 15-footer for eagle on 5. Then I was 6-under and hit the pin on 13, almost flew in the cup but missed the cup. 

 Q. You had the Henley Brothers to deal with today?
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, it was pretty unbelievable. First week for Brent on Robert's bag and then I get paired with him. I got paired with him two years ago and here's Woody (Austin).

 Q. I believe that every time you guys get paired together, one of you guys wins the golf tournament. 
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, I think the last two times it happened. 

 Q. Final question: When you call the people that provide your clothing, what do you call those pants, what color do you call that?
 BRIAN GAY: Sligo green or lime. 

 Q. You look sharp. 
 BRIAN GAY: Thanks. 

 Q. Keep up the good work. 
 BRIAN GAY: Thanks.
