 Q.   Brian, good solid playing there for two days, 7‑under par, what's been the key this week?  
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah, I've hit the ball real nicely.   I think I've only missed three greens in two days, missed one green today and my only bogey was a 3‑putt.   
It was a lot tougher today, different wind direction and some really good pins out there, especially on the front.   It seems to be on which way the wind is coming from.  
   
 Q.   As you come into this week, I would think this would be a good golf course for you.   It's not overly long, but really keeping the ball in play and putting well is the key.   
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah, yeah, the greens are tough, like you said.   Actually the greens are perfect, but I happened to see that spot the Golf Channel put up the other night.   I think they're the toughest greens on TOUR, if not first or second in a bunch of categories.   
Greens are perfect.   Yeah, you gotta keep the ball in play off the tee here, and the fairways are soft, so the ball's not really going to run into trouble, so if you get it in the fairway, you're all right.  
   
 Q.   You've played on the TOUR long enough, you're going to have some up and down years.   What's been the problem this year and what have you sort of righted towards the end of the season?  
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah, it's been a bit of a long year.   I've made some swing changes and it's tough to try to play and do that.   And lately I haven't been that healthy.   But just keep working at it, you know, try to finish calm.  
   
 Q.   Well playing so far.   Good luck this weekend.   
BRIAN GAY:   Thank you.
