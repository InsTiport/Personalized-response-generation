  Q. How have you been playing, Brian?  
 BRIAN GAY: Late on Friday made a couple coming in to make the cut, and played better yesterday and even better today.   
  
  Q. On Friday you made the cut, was that the last hole?   
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, last one. I knew I had to make it and somehow I made it. I hadn't made one for two days and I made that one.   
  
  Q. Thanks, Brian.   
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Can you tell me how you played the fourth hole?   
 BRIAN GAY: It gave me fits this week.   
  
  Q. How do you go about playing that hole?   
 BRIAN GAY: I wanted to use a driver out there. I hit it in the left rough there because the right bunkers are no good, and the wind has been hard right to left, and the fairway slopes over toward with the haggard over there. Then, you know, with the pin on the right, you've got the wind today; it's over there by that bunker.   
  
  Q. What do you use for an approach?   
 BRIAN GAY: For me I would say 9-iron, 8-iron, 6-iron, maybe.   
  
  Q. One of the goals to the re-do was to make this course tougher. Is 4 a good example of that, maybe a tougher hole than it used to be?   
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, it's a little tighter, and I think they did a good job. The greens seem to have more movement in them now. It gets firm, the balls roll off into those catch areas and it's tough to get up and down, and the ball starts running away from the greens.
