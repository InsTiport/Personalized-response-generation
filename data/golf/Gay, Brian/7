Q. Except for an opening hole, great round for you.
BRIAN GAY: Yeah, with a breakfast ball I'm two better, right?  It was nice to make a five after shooting it over to the right there on the first hole.  And I played pretty solid, I made a couple good putts there right after that as well and made a few birdies in a row and just kind of hung around all day and got a couple more late.
Q. Talk about the back nine here and those final five holes and just how much fun they are to play, the opportunities they present.
BRIAN GAY: Yeah, 14 is probably the hardest hole and then 15, depending upon what you hit it's maybe, maybe not reachable.  16's always fun.  And I was able to knock it on and got on the front of the green on 17 today and 2-putted for birdie.
Q. Everything healthy?  Do you feel fully back?
BRIAN GAY: Yeah, I feel about as good as I can, but, no, after surgery everything's good.
