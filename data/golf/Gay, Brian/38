  Q. Brian, a match where you won two of the first three holes, but never seemed comfortable with it. It was back and forth the rest of the day?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, Zach is tough. We were pretty close there all day. I was lucky enough to get to have a good start, get a hole or two up on him early.  
  
  Q. You love playing par-3s, you won a couple of them today, and they were big holes for you, mainly because you kept the driver in your bag?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, well, I hit only one or two kind of my drivers, but one bad 3-wood on 14.  
 Yeah, I played the par-3s really good last year, and unfortunately the par-5s killed me.   
  
  Q. How about that shot at 18, though, when you needed one from 210 to hit it off the stick?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, 17 I would never have hit that one over. I hit it absolutely perfect, and somehow with the wind off to the right, it fell to the right and caught the ridge. Unbelievable putt there. 18, I took it right of it, wind out to the right.  
  
  Q. First time you've played in this event. Kimberly is having fun, are you having fun?  
 BRIAN GAY: It seems like a lot of work, but it is fun. I had fun out there today. It's the first time I've played match play since the Amateur.  
  
  Q. Is it all gravy from here? Do you feel I've won a couple or now do you get greedy?  
 BRIAN GAY: Now I think every day is a new match and a chance to move on. It's like starting over every time. So go get after it tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Keep having fun.
