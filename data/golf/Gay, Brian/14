Q.   Best round of the week so far, you had it going on the front nine? 
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah, I got off to terrible starts the first two days, and hitting good shots but just putted horrific the first few holes both the first two rounds, and I hit good shots again today and made the putts.

Q.   This is a golf course, it's a long golf course, but really I think the key is iron play and putting and that's something you're noted for. 
BRIAN GAY:   Yeah, it's pretty open off the tee so it's not a big deal driving the ball out here.   There are some long holes, but there's some scoring opportunities.   It's just getting in the right spot on the green to have a good look at it.

Q.   You've had so much success on bermudagreens.   What's the key for you putting these greens so well? 
BRIAN GAY:   Well, I was wondering the last two days.   Spend a little time opponent the putting green after the round yesterday.   I love bermuda, I grew up on it.   These are tough.   There's a lot of slope and wind and you can't tell up, down and everything around here.   They are tough to putt.

Q.   Is it your ability to read them or you have a great feel for them?
BRIAN GAY:   I'm comfortable on them.   Growing up on them, I'm just comfortable on bermuda and I guess I see it better, feel it better.
