  Q. Tell me about your round today.   
 BRIAN GAY: I hit the ball good today, didn't get any putts to drop. Had a three-putt early on No. 3, and I hit -- had a couple tap ins for birdie.   
 I made one, about a 16, 18-footer on 16. That was it. Just didn't make anything. Played good, though. Played better than I did the first two days, but didn't make any putts.  
  
  Q. And conditions of the course today?  
 BRIAN GAY: Good. A little bit DRIER. About the same, though.  
  
  Q. And any thoughts going into tomorrow with you guys, the race still relatively close with the top three?  
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah. Just go out and do the same stuff. Hopefully hole some putts tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Thanks, Brian.
