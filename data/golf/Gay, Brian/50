  Q. One shot out of the lead I thought you did a good job maintaining your composure when you went through a little rough patch on the back nine missing greens.   
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, it was tough. I hit a couple loose iron shots and a couple good ones that went through the green and made some good saves, and really had to hang in there, like you said.  
  
  Q. You kept the round together and then you convert a rare two after the 17th.   
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, I was fortunate to birdie that Thursday, as well, so it's been good to me.  
  
  Q. And now you're in position to win your second PGA TOUR event.   
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, like you said, I was able to hang in there in the middle part of the round and still stay in the golf tournament, so got a chance to go out there tomorrow and get it done.  
  
  Q. This is by far the best weather of the week and yet it's changing weather. Was it difficult to read the wind? Seemed to me the speed of the greens changed.   
 BRIAN GAY: Yeah, they were maybe a little bit faster than yesterday, but the hardest part about today was it was a completely new golf course for us.   
 We have not had this wind all week and it's been that Kona wind all week, so it was a whole new deal out there today.
