  Q. Talk about your day?  
 BRIAN GAY: Kind of like the first three days, I had it from three to five under all week but today I finally had that round -- my caddie said to me, we haven't had that run like everybody else this week and I finally strung a few together. I can't drive the greens and I can get up there in the fairway in front of the green, I hit it really close on 12 and 14, I had birdie putts there.   
 Early in the week, I think sometimes it can work the opposite, because you can put so much pressure. I didn't get as many as I should have early in the week but I got them today.   
 I don't think they are going to go backwards. The greens are soft and the wind is not blowing much now. They are going to keep making birdies.   
 I'm really pleased with the finish and was able to get on a little bit of a run there. Going back all week and finally got a run going.
