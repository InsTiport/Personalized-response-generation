Q.   7‑under round today, what was the difference for you? 
MINA HARIGAE:   I think just making the putts.   I've been hitting it pretty well all week, and last two rounds, I always had one bad hole but today I minimized everything. 

Q.   Wind is starting to pick up now and 7‑under looks like it's going to be the low round of the day.   How important was it for to you put that number up? 
MINA HARIGAE:   Very important.   The scores have been really low.   Without the wind it's a good course to get a lot of birdies so I'm really glad I was able to move up today.

Q.   You mentioned with the wind picking up, how much different does this course play when the wind is up? 
MINA HARIGAE:   You know, some holes, they are really tough, especially No.9.   Blowing left‑to‑right towards the water, the club difference, I'd say it's like three or four shots different. 

Q.   You had some success in Taiwan before, you had a Top‑5 last year.   I know it's a different course this year but what about Taiwan kind of suits your golf game? 
MINA HARIGAE:   You know, I think at the last course, it was really windy, so you had to hit good shots.   I do well at courses where it's tougher I guess.   I'm not the longest hitter in the world, so if it's a birdie‑fest I don't quite make as many as the top players do.   But I think when it gets tough, that's when I can grind things out.

Q.   What are some of the things you've been able to do this week in Taiwan staying downtown? 
MINA HARIGAE:   Eat a lot of great food, see a ton of stores.   I really like staying downtown.
