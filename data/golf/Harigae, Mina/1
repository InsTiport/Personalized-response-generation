  Q. Mina, nice 3-under, bogey-free to open up your play at the Kia Classic.  Take us through the round, especially how nice it was to not find a bogey.
 MINA HARIGAE:   Yeah, pretty solid out there today.  Didn't make a lot of mistakes.  I don't think I missed a green today, so that helped a lot.  I think what really helped was I put my new Gen4 0311Ps from PXG last week.  I played with it at the Symetra Tour last week in Arizona, so that was a really nice warmup.
 Had a lot of confidence going into this week.
 Q. I was going to say, you had a top 10 last week.  How nice was it when most people are probably just sitting at home and you're playing?
 MINA HARIGAE:   Yeah, it was nice because it was only 20 minutes from my house and I wanted to get more competitive rounds in before next week, so it was just all in all a good week.
 Q. How did that prepare you just mentally to kind of -- you kind of did something similar last year.  When we hit the pandemic you played on the Cactus Tour, won a couple times, and the results showed at the end of the year.  How can just the repetitions help you it seems?
 MINA HARIGAE:   That's exactly what I was trying to do.  I was trying to replicate that, just like I said, have more competitive rounds and get more confidence.  That's exactly what I did.
 I had a good weekend and gave me more confidence coming into this week there how.
 Q. How good it is to be back at Aviara?
 MINA HARIGAE:   It feels great.  I really missed it last year.  Just to be back in California playing I really missed it and it's great to be back.
 Q. Were the nines different at all with maybe a little wind on one versus less wind on the other today?
 MINA HARIGAE:   I think we got a pretty good draw.  We started on the back nine.  I would say that's probably the windier nine, so we got that out of the way.
 The front nine is a little more tree-lined so wasn't too bad, but you could definitely feel it out there.
 Q. What is the game plan heading into the next three days with the position you put yourself in?
 MINA HARIGAE:   Just more of the same.  Just keep on literally doing the same.  Try to hit all the greens again.  That helps a lot.  Rest a lot.  It's a really hilly course.  That's about it.
 Q. Is that about the most greens you've ever hit in a round probably competitively?
 MINA HARIGAE:   I think I've done it maybe a couple times.  But, yeah, it's not -- I don't do it all the time.
 Q. Doesn't happen every day.
 MINA HARIGAE:   Be nice it if it happened every day.  No, it was a good ball striking day.
