Q. Mina, playing solid all week.  I think in the top three right now.  How do you feel coming out of this week at Reynolds Lake Oconee?
MINA HARIGAE:   I mean, I feel great.  I was hitting it really well this week, my driver especially.  I think I only missed a couple fairways all week.
But, yeah, I wish I made a little more putts on the first day, but they came together the rest of the time.  It's been great.
Q. Being able to finish strong there, especially on the back nine, what has this week been like for you and what does it say about how comfortable you're feeling in your game?
MINA HARIGAE:   I'm definitely feeling more and more comfortable.  The last few tournaments ShopRite and KPMG I was always near, lurking.  So I had little bit of nerves but feel like I handled it a lot better.
It was good.
Q. I know you finished I think T6 and T13 in the last two tournaments.  What has been going right you think, so well, in your game over the last two tournaments and now this one?
MINA HARIGAE:   Just I think my game just is finally coming together.  I'm really comfortable my swing.  My PXG equipment has been working fantastic for me.
Just everything has been great.
Q. Now, it's a little difficult because we have three weeks before Tampa.  Will you step away before going back to Tampa or what is the plan with the three weeks now that we have a break?
MINA HARIGAE:   Right now I don't know if I'm in Tampa.  Does a top 10 get me into Tampa?
Q. I'm not sure?
MINA HARIGAE:   If I'm in Tampa I'll definitely take a few days off.  I usually do right after a tournament.  I'll start it ramp back up, work on my short game and putting.
