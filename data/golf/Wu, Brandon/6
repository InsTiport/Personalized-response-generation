Q. What was the approach today going into difficult course No. 2 here?
BRANDON WU: I mean, I feel like no lead is safe on this course, so I just maybe tried to pick a little more conservative targets but just stay aggressive to what I was trying to do and go out and try and play as well as I could.
Q. What do you think was on for your game this time around, today?
BRANDON WU: I hit my irons great today.  I hit a lot of greens, a lot of center of the greens, which was good.  I didn't end up making many putts, so no birdies today, but only two bogeys is not too bad out here.
Q. What's the plan for the rest of the day?
BRANDON WU: Probably get some rest.  I was definitely running out of gas towards the end.  It was hot.  The course is tough.  It's a grind.  I'll get some lunch, get some rest and get ready for tomorrow.
Q. Hard to believe that in a couple of times being in the U.S. Amateur that you haven't played it to match play, so now heading in maybe the co-medalist, what does that mean to you, and what's your mindset going into match play now?
BRANDON WU: Yeah, I'm really excited for match play.  We've gotten to play quite a bit, both at the national championship and at the Western Am last year, so I'm super excited to play that, and yeah, it's honestly a nice hump to get over.  It's like, having that on you, never played match play at U.S. Am is not great, so glad I finally conquered that.
