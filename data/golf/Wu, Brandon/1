Q. Just would love to hear about this week, playing so close to home, being local, about the whole experience.  How was it?
BRANDON WU:   I think it was so cool.  It was such a thrill to be able to get to hit the first tee shot, to stay at home for a U.S. Open.  Yeah, just kind of tried to soak it all in.  Obviously it's a tough golf course and I didn't have my best this week, but I mean, at the end of the day I think it's all smiles and just move forward and kind of enjoy these experiences.  They're pretty rare, and it's pretty special.
Q. What's next?
BRANDON WU:   A couple more events on the Korn Ferry to finish out this year, and yeah, get ready for next year.
