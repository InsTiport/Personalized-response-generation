   D.J. TRAHAN: A lot of wind today, the golf course obviously is only getting firmer and faster, so it's really tough to make birdies out there and even to make pars. So I'm very happy with 1-over. 
 Could have been better, but I guess on the other hand it maybe could have been worse.

 Q. How difficult is it to keep your patience and realize you're going to make bogeys and you're still in touch here? 
 D.J. TRAHAN: I think you have to. I think you just have to understand that there's not a lot of birdies to be made out there and that pars are good scores. 
 It is a Major Championship and it's going to be tough. So with that in mind you don't really attack, you just try and play smart and hopefully hit some good golf shots and go from there.

 Q. Talk a little bit about the Ryder Cup, is that in the back of your mind?
 D.J. TRAHAN: Absolutely. I want to make the team more than anything I ever wanted in my life, so obviously I'm thinking very much about that. 
 But when I'm out there playing I'm thinking about the task at hand. Right now when I'm done playing, obviously I think about that a little bit more. I'm obviously though it would be a tremendous honor to be a part of that.
