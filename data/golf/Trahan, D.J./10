 Q. Can you talk about what you think it would mean to the game of golf globally to be able to compete in the Olympics?
 D.J. TRAHAN: I think golf is definitely a great sport. Obviously it not being in the Olympics -- the Olympics is a big deal. It would be another tremendous lift for the game of golf to be a part of that. Certainly we should hope they vote for it. It would be a good thing for the game.

 Q. Now it doesn't have the history, but could you imagine some day the gold medal meaning almost like a major?
 D.J. TRAHAN: I don't think so, no. I don't think -- because obviously golf wasn't part of the Olympics. It's not part of the Olympics. So I think a major championship still means more to me than winning a gold medal in the Olympics. Obviously that would be wonderful to participate in it and to win a gold medal, but I don't think anything really compares to a major.

 Q. What do you think about 72 holes stroke play format?
 D.J. TRAHAN: I think that's the way it needs to be played. You can't play match play. There's too many countries. It just wouldn't work. Obviously you need to have a stroke play if golf is going to be played in the Olympics, really the only way to make it reasonable.
