  Q. 3-under has to make you happy?   
 D.J. TRAHAN: I'm very happy obviously. I really didn't have a hiccup on 11. I hit my first putt down there about four feet and I really had no chance on that putt unfortunately. I played great today, hit the ball well and really controlled the ball nicely in the wind.   
  
  Q. Is this one of the courses when you come out in the morning and see it blowing windy like this, do you say to yourself, all right, just going to have to chill today, or is it like that even if it's no wind?   
 D.J. TRAHAN: I think you always have a very conservative approach to this golf course. Par is a good score and winning score here is never very low. You just want to try to keep it in play and give yourself some opportunities. Obviously when you show up and it's blowing like it is right now, it adds a whole other factor to the equation. 3-under, I'm obviously extremely pleased with that.   
  
  Q. Standing on the 10th with the wind blowing into you, there had to be a point where you said, really, come on, the back tees going?  
 D.J. TRAHAN: Yeah, and they were back today, and 500 yards, that's an unbelievable par 4, especially when it's into you off the right like it is today. Had I hit a good drive there, it would have been a long iron in. Still, that's a tough drive any day when the wind is not long, never mind 25.
