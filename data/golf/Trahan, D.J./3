  Q. Sort of an interesting day.   
 D.J. TRAHAN: Yeah, well, they're always interesting when you're playing to keep your job. I made a great putt there on the last hole. Certainly 9, if -- you know, I had three birdies today. Two of 'em came on par-3s and the longest par-4 on the course, so it was almost an uncanny day.   
 Then I made just the one bogey. I blocked my drive right on 2 and had to take a drop, and hit a tree and ricocheted into the hazard.   
 So it was a crazy day, but it looks like I played just well enough just to hang in there.  
  
  Q. Didn't you make a key birdie down the stretch there?  
 D.J. TRAHAN: Not really. I mean, yeah, I birdied the last hole.   
  
  Q. Yeah. About how far?  
 D.J. TRAHAN: Oh, I had about 21 feet. I had driver, 4-iron in there, so it was a really big birdie. I don't know what par would have done. I really honestly don't know what difference that would have made, but birdie certainly didn't hurt me.   
 So I'm thrilled that I made that putt. What more could I ask for? My goal today was just to keep my card, and it looks like I was able to do that. It's been a long year, so I'm glad it's over.  
  
  Q. As fluid as things are out there on a day like today, what do you go out there trying to do?  
 D.J. TRAHAN: Oh, I mean, you just got to go out and play one shot at a time. It's no different than any day you step on the golf course. Doesn't matter if you're playing the final round of a major or the final round today to keep your card.   
 My mindset is always the same. You have a game plan, and you have to be decisive and just try and hit as many good shots as you can.
