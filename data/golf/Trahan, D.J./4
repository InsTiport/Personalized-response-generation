  Q. Great playing today. Obviously you gotta feel good. 36 holes under your belt. Just talk about how you're feeling going into the weekend.  
 D.J. TRAHAN: You know, I just started off slow the first 18. I played solid. I just didn't score, and then I really got going there on the second 18. I made a couple of really nice putts there early. I made about a 20-footer there on the first hole, and gees, I made about maybe a 14-footer on 3 and made a really nice one from probably 30 feet on 5.   
 Those were like -- well, especially 1 and 5 were nice little gifts, but all around played very, very solid there. To turn at 6-under, though, I was a little disappointed with my back nine because I really did play solid on the back nine. I missed it from five feet on 10 and hit it in there close on 12 to about 10 or 11 feet and missed that and then didn't birdie the par-5, 13. And I was right there in front of the green in two and didn't get that up-and-down.   
 So obviously some disappointment with the back nine, but it's hard to be disappointed shooting 8-under par. I played very well this afternoon and gave myself a lot of opportunities, and obviously I'd like to do the same thing the next couple of rounds.
