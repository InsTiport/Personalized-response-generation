 Q. Describe how the day went for you. 
 D. J. TRAHAN: My day wasn't bad. I just kind of felt like it was kind of a stale day out there. I just never really got anything going. I played steady golf and 3-under isn't bad, but when the guy you're playing with starts with the lead and shoots 8-under, obviously you can do a lot better than three.
 He played excellent. He certainly played a little better than I did. I feel like I definitely left a few out there, but that's golf. I certainly tried my best on every shot. So it just wasn't meant for me today as far as a low score was concerned.
 Crazier things have happened. All I can do is go out there, hopefully, tomorrow and shoot lights-out, and obviously that's what I'm going to try to do.

 Q. Do you think the weather plays to an advantage with it kind of throwing everybody a big curve, maybe somebody isn't able to just get comfortable?
 D. J. TRAHAN: I think so. I think if the weather is as bad as they say it's going to be tomorrow, it's pretty difficult for anybody to get comfortable. That opens the door for maybe someone, if they go out and shoot a great round, to have a chance to possibly catch him. Obviously with foul weather, sometimes that can stall a guy out. But Geoff's playing so solidly, it's hard to say. It's going to be difficult to catch him.
