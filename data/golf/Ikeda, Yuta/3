  Q. If you can talk about your round today.   
 YUTA IKEDA: The second round today, I made the turn really well and birdied 8 and 9 and got some momentum going and couldn't carry that on to the second nine. I was giving it my best, but just nothing was happening. Glad we got two more rounds so I can play a little better.   
  
  Q. How hard was it to play after what happened today?   
 YUTA IKEDA: Yes, it was very difficult.   
  
  Q. Were you able to find out about friends and family, other people back home?  
 YUTA IKEDA: The tough part; the cell phones still are not working in Japan. So I made many calls, but everyone I haven't been able to contact. It doesn't mean they are not accounted for. It just means I haven't been able to contact them to make sure they are okay.  
  
  Q. What do you remember about going to school in Sendai? Can you talk about the city a little bit?   
 YUTA IKEDA: It's tough. It's my second hometown. I was born and raised in Chiba, but I went to school in Sendai and to see what you had to see on TV was very difficult to take in.   
  
  Q. Were you trying to contact people during the round through your caddie or friends?   
 YUTA IKEDA: No, just playing golf.   
  
  Q. How worried are you still about your family and the people of Japan?   
 YUTA IKEDA: Of course. I'm very, very concerned.   
  
  Q. How did you find out about it this morning? Right when you woke up?  
 YUTA IKEDA: I got an e-mail from a friend in the middle of the night, and from that time on, then just watching TV and making phone calls.
