Q. How does it feel to enter such a big tournament for the first time?
YUTA IKEDA: This is so-called the first major, and I'm so excited to be here.  This is a course that everything is tested, and it is before the tournament, but I'm very excited, and I'll give it my best.
Q. Nobody ever managed to win it back-to-back; what do you think is the main reason it makes it so difficult that it never happened before so far?
YUTA IKEDA: My impression is that each hole has difficulties, and each hole is different, and probably you like one hole, the other one it's not so good, and then you have to keep that for four days, and then to keep that for the next year, which would be very difficult, and then on this very difficult course.  So I think that to keep that continuity to play the hole like four days, that integrity, it would be very, very tough, and that's why it's so hard to do back-to-back.
