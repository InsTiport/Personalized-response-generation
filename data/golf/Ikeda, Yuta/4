  First Round 67 (-5)

 CALVIN KOH: Good afternoon, thanks for coming today. Congratulations on your brilliant opening round. If you can start with an assessment of the round today. 
 YUTA IKEDA: I had two bogeys from the start, and I hit eagle at fourth and that gave me a good start and I had good golf. 
 CALVIN KOH: Playing alongside two Major winners; do you feel any pressure playing alongside them, especially with the crowds following you? 
 YUTA IKEDA: It was an honour to be in the same group with two Major winners. That gave me courage and that led me to good golf today. 

 Q. Could you please explain your eagle; go through it. 
 YUTA IKEDA: Second shot, 135 yards with 9-iron and 3-iron two yards from the cup and two bounces.

 Q. How exciting is it for you to be where you are on the leaderboard? 
 YUTA IKEDA: Although I'm at the top, it's still the first round. I have no feelings. 

 Q. Last year you are doing very well, but still behind Ishikawa. This year, you're also doing very well, but it seems like the focus is still with Ishikawa. So do you think you are just a little bit overshadowed by Ishikawa's brightness? 
 YUTA IKEDA: This year, still have four tournaments left and still some chances left, so I'll do my best. It is obvious to be focussed at Ishikawa, but I'm going to do my best. 

 Q. What do you think of the Asian field this week at HSBC?
 YUTA IKEDA: I have been to this tournament this year and the tournament itself is very good, but it's tough. 
 CALVIN KOH: Thank you for coming, we wish you the best of luck tomorrow.
