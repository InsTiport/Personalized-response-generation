  Q. (No microphone.)  
 YUTA IKEDA: I heard about it. I knew about it and I read about it a little bit, but when I played I tried to concentrate on my play. So I tried not to make that bother me.  
  
  Q. How did you hear about it? On TV, on the Internet or did somebody tell you?  
 YUTA IKEDA: The telephone and the people around me, they just told me.   
  
  Q. How difficult was it to concentrate? Was it worse for you like a month ago or in the fact that you're having to play on this big stage in terms of your concentration, which was more un-nerving? Coping with it a month ago or having to do it today?  
 YUTA IKEDA: I keep getting information and that's why that I don't -- I know it bothers me from time to time, but at the same time I try to concentrate on my play, that's what I try to do.   
  
  Q. Have you talked to your family or any friends at all?  
 YUTA IKEDA: I haven't talked to them yet because I was here when it happened already.   
  
  Q. Are all of them accounted for from the first earthquake?  
 YUTA IKEDA: My friends and everybody I knew was okay.   
  
  Q. Is your family here watching the Tournament or are they back there?  
 YUTA IKEDA: My mom's here.   
  
  Q. What would it mean for you to play well this week, to make the cut and do well? What would that mean to you and to the people back home?  
 YUTA IKEDA: The only thing I can do is to play well and show myself to the people in Japan and that's the only thing I can do at this point.
