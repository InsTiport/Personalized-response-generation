 Q.  Great playing out there today.  What's been the key for you so far this week?  
HIROSHI IWATA: My short game.  Short game was the key.   
 Q.  Is this type of golf course and the grass here that fits your game and makes your short game a little bit sharper here?  
HIROSHI IWATA: It's tough, but I think it's the view out here.  It's the view that helps me with the short game.   
 Q.  You shot 66 at Pebble when you played earlier this week, how comfortable are you on that golf course for tomorrow?  
HIROSHI IWATA: I don't know exactly, until tomorrow, but the fact that the Pebble Beach's greens are a little bit firmer, and it's all going to depend on the pin position, but we're going to have to see tomorrow.   
 Q.  Playing in the final group most likely tomorrow, how do you think you'll handle the pressure?  
HIROSHI IWATA: I haven't felt any nerves or I haven't felt any pressure quite yet, but whether it's going to be regardless of tonight or tomorrow morning, I just want to make sure I go out there and in a good mental condition.   
 Q.  What do you do to prepare yourself for playing in the final round?  A good chance you'll be playing with Phil Mickelson, there will be a lot of people out there.  What do you do to prepare yourself?  
HIROSHI IWATA: I've been here since last week, Sunday, so it's no different, it's another day tomorrow.  So I want to make sure that I keep everything the same, the same routine, the same everything, and just go out there and play.
