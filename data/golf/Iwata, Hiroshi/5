 Q.   How happy are you with how you played?   
HIROSHI IWATA:   The last one was a lucky birdie but overall I think I'm playing pretty good.   Not too excited, not overexcited.   The same as yesterday.   I'm just playing and focusing on my game.  
   
 Q.   Why aren't you excited?   You're in second place in a wonderful competition?  
HIROSHI IWATA:   Well, this is how I am.   I'm kind of grounded, not get too excited.   This is the kind of person I am, I'm sorry.   
   
 Q.   Don't apologise.   Does that help when you're in a big field like this with so many star players around on a hard golf course?   
HIROSHI IWATA:   Maybe tomorrow coming up the last few holes, I might get a little bit nervous, but so far I'm calm.   So I think I'm doing okay.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about your experience and how that experience will help tomorrow?  
HIROSHI IWATA:   I always try to focus one shot by one.   I'm kind of relatively short tempered, so I always focus not to get too angry at myself.   I believe I'm doing pretty good at that at the moment, so I just want to keep that going.   
   
 Q.   Shortâ€‘tempered; you get angry quickly?  
HIROSHI IWATA:   I'm pretty famous for that in Japan.
