MEL REID: Yeah, that's probably the best conditions you're going to get.  The wind hasn't really picked up.  I mean, it was maybe one to two clubs, but yeah, you're not going to get Kingsbarns much tamer than that, so it was important to take advantage of that this morning.
Q. You turned in 4-under par, a couple of bogeys on the back nine but bounced back with birdies straightaway; how important were they?
MEL REID: Yeah, I mean, I've hit one bad putt all day, which was on 16, I just looked up a little early, which I tend to do.  But yeah, I felt me and Kev have done a lot of good work the last few days, and I've felt like I've been striking it really well and been rolling my putts well.  Yeah, I've felt like -- looking at my season, you probably wouldn't think I'm having a good season, but I feel like I'm very, very close to doing something, and I'm just feeling very comfortable out there.
Q. Coming into this tournament, five missed cuts consecutively but not very true to the form you've been feeling.  How confident are you now after getting this first round under your belt?
MEL REID: Yeah, I've felt all right all season to be honest.  I've missed cuts by a shot.  You know, that's all I've been missing them by.  We know from last week in Scotland that the difference between missing a cut and contending is actually very, very small.  I've just had a couple of bad bounces here and there and it's just not gone my way.  Yeah, it was nice obviously to post a score there early, and hopefully this is my week to do something special.  That would be nice.
Q. How pleased are you with the round you put together?
MEL REID: Yeah, you're not going to get Kingsbarns much easier than that to be honest.  It was maybe one or two clubs out there at the most.  You know, it's important when it's like that to take advantage, especially in a tournament like this where on a links course you are going to get a bad break here and there with the weather and the contours of everything.  Yeah, I mean, it's important to shoot a good number.
Q. It's a course that you love here at Kingsbarns.  How much does it suit your game?
MEL REID: It does.  I mean, I was just telling Brittany Lang that I love the layout of it.  Greens are a little bit funky here and there for a links golf course, but I mean, the layout is superb, and the condition of it, I've never played it in bad condition.  I just feel like it really suits me on the tee, really suits my eye.
Q. How comfortable do you feel with your game right now and where you're at?
MEL REID: Yeah, I mean, you look at my season, I've had a win, but I've had I think six or seven missed cuts by a shot.  We saw last week in Scotland the difference between missing a cut and contending is very, very small, and I feel like I've been very, very close, it's just not quite happened for me.  I've spent a lot of time with Kev over the last few days, my coach, and maybe we found something.  I was struggling on the range yesterday, and I feel for the first time this season probably that I feel extremely comfortable with my swing, and I've put in a lot of hours to feel like that, and yeah, I just feel pretty good about this week.
Q. The weather is supposed to turn in the afternoon --
MEL REID: Hopefully, yeah.
Q. Do you go back and sit and watch it?
MEL REID: Yeah, of course you do.  I've had the wrong side of the draw so many times.  It all evens out at the end.  Yeah, I'm just going to go and have a nice casual lunch, and yeah, maybe do a workout this afternoon and just watch the weather come in hopefully.  Like I said, everyone gets the bad side of the draw at some point, and hopefully we've got the good side of the draw this time.
