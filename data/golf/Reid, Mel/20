Q. So, just thoughts on the match today?
MEL REID: I mean, it was incredible.  We're five into it, I mean seven and we're 3 down.  I think we were 10-under in the four-ball.  And it was -- you can't be good against everybody.  They just played phenomenal golf.
And, yeah, we had a tough task standing on 18.  We fought extremely hard like me and Carlota always do.  Kind of dream team is back.  And we always play really well together.  And, yeah, you can't be too disappointed when you play as well as that.
Q. Battling back how you guys did, after that early deficit, how much momentum does that give you two going into tomorrow's singles matches?
MEL REID: Of course, it does.  I think that Carlota has been a little bit deflated yesterday, and I feel like now she's back, and we have the old Carlota back.  And I think it's important that we played together today because we love playing together.  And I do feel that we are a bit of a dream team.  And people are going to have to play extremely well to beat us.  And that's good.
I feel now she's got a lot of energy going into tomorrow.  And she's feeling confident again, feeling a bit more comfortable.  And I think she's going to get some blue on the boards for us tomorrow.
