Q. Took you longer than you thought.  Was it worth the wait?
MEL REID:   I'm so emotional.  Like 100%, yeah.  I just want to call my dad to be honest.  Just after like Portland I wanted to redeem myself and just felt like I handed things a lot better today obviously.  Just a huge respect and thank you to Dez, my caddie.  He really pulled me through today.  I love the boy to death.  He's kind of our new roommate.  Thank you, bud.
Q. What will that call with your father be like?
MEL REID:   He's probably in the pub.  He's probably not coherent right now.  Hopefully he's watching it in the Black Swan.  Yeah, probably not coherent right now, so if he can just say a couple words that will be nice.
Q. Bogey at 17; not an 18.  (Wind)  was that as much a relief as anything else when that 6-iron came out of there?
MEL REID:   Yeah, it actually came out perfect.  We weer thinking between 5 and 6 but we knew being short was fine.  Obviously disappointed with 17, but we didn't want to do anything stupid.  Just spun a little bit more than we wanted it to.
Yeah, just relief.  Huge relief.
Q. (Regarding people with alcohol and water.)  (Wind interference.)
MEL REID:   No, thank you to everyone.  Thank you so much guys for coming out.  It makes it special when you got your mates here, and just all the messages I've had over the last few days, I do read them and I hugely appreciate it.
There is a lot more too it than just me.  I've got a whole team, friends.  My friends are like my family, so just everyone involved, everyone deserves a drink tonight.
