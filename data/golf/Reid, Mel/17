 Q.  Three birdies. Pretty good way to start off a round. You've got to feel pretty good right now.  
MEL REID: Yeah, didn't really know what to expect because obviously haven't played since Portland, so had a few kind of weeks no tournament play.   
Yeah, worked really hard the last couple weeks and, yeah, I mean, obviously a great started. Kind of hit it semi-close on the first, like close on the second, and close on the third.   
So three birdies, I was obviously very happy. It's a tough golf course. You can't really switch up. If you miss it on the wrong side of the greens you're really struggling to get up and down.   
Greens are pretty undulating and very, very tricky, so lots of greens this week and you're going to do well.   
 Q.  Been working on anything in particular?  
MEL REID: Just the same old stuff. Just trying to get, yeah, trying to find out the magic ingredient.   
Yeah, I just worked extremely hard. I had to go back to England last week, so I knew I was going to have three or four days of kind of not practicing, so I kind of tried to fit it all ten days prior.   
Yeah, no, happy with the 69 to kind of start off this week.
