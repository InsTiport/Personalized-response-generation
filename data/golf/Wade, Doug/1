 Q.   Could you talk about your trip after the club pro?  
DOUG WADE:   It's been a big month, I've had a couple of big events at my club, we had a baby and we moved.   Didn't get a whole lot of preparation until last week and played about four or five times before I got down here.   Got down here Sunday night and then played three practice rounds.   
Just do the best you can, but it was a lot of fun out there.   
   
 Q.   So the rain didn't mess you up too much for your practice rounds?  
DOUG WADE:   No.   Ended up, just stayed a few extra hours normally than I would have.   
   
 Q.   What are some of your highlights?   
DOUG WADE:   One of the highlights, I have about 30 family friends down here, so having them out there was a lot of fun.   I birdied 17, the par3, in front of a big audience, which was really cool.   The lowlights were just the beginning of the round.   
I was a lot more nervous than I thought I would be, hit a drive in there on 11 and it was compounded with a really bad break, and I just got frazzled, made a terrible 8 on 11, and that‑‑ you know, it took me a while to get out of that funk to be honest with you.   
   
 Q.   How was your first tee shot and meeting some of the pros out here?   
DOUG WADE:   Well, I played with two great guys.   I hit a pretty good tee shot.   I was very nervous but it was pretty cool.
