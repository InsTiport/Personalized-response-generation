PAUL ROVNAK:  Kris, great round today, 5 birdies, no bogeys and early clubhouse leader.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  It's nice for me to not have to talk about any bogeys.  That's very rare for me.
PAUL ROVNAK:  What was working for you today?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  I just putted better.  I've really struggled with my putting the last couple of weeks and just rolled it better today.
PAUL ROVNAK:  We'll take questions.
Q.  I was going through your performance chart for the year and this might be your first chance to make some money in a few months.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  Yes, it just hasn't been a good year.  I felt very healthy at the beginning of the year.  I felt like I was going to finally have a year where my back was feeling good.  It was good for about three tournaments.  And then it actually felt good    I took like five weeks off in the middle of the summer and came back to Canada and it felt good.  In Portland it felt good.  And my putter was just terrible so I missed both those cuts, which was frustrating because I know when my back is good I need to take advantage of it.

I went home for about four days and worked on it a little bit with my husband.  It felt better today.  I rolled it well.
Q.  What was the course like?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  Well, it's playing a little longer than it has in previous years.  It's a little softer so we're not getting quite as much roll.  But it was good.  Of course I was playing early, so the greens are rolling a little bit better.  I'm sure it won't be that way tomorrow afternoon.
Q.  Did you take advantage of the lift, clean and place on any of those three holes?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  The first fairway I missed was No. 1, so I didn't get to there.  It helped on the other two holes.
Q.  Does this change anything mentality wise going into tomorrow?  Obviously there are a lot of golfers out there and who knows whether you'll be sitting in the lead.  Posting the number you did, does it change anything for you going forward?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  Not really.  It just feels good to me to have a round under my belt.  I didn't have any bogeys and I putted better.  I feel like I've hit it well the last couple of weeks.  Actually, I didn't hit it as well as I did the last couple of weeks, but when that putter is working, it makes a big difference.
Q.  (No microphone.)
KRIS TSCHETTER:  A little bit, but we just came from Portland, so it's hard to say anything is fast after being there.  Those greens are about the fastest we play all year.
Q.  It said in the book that you had hip surgery in '01.  Is that what is giving you back problems?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  '01, '02, and '03.
Q.  Three years in a row?
KRIS TSCHETTER: Yes.
Q.  What was the problem?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  I just had some tears in there.  And my hips are actually better.  My back has been volatile for the last ten years probably.  Every golfer has back problems.  That probably contributes to it a little bit.
Q.  You've had two kids, too?
KRIS TSCHETTER: Yes, I have got two kids.
Q.  You mentioned the back being volatile for about ten years.  It looked like from the record book in the mid '90s you were right there knocking on the door of being a really good player.  Have the health problems cost you?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  Yes, I think that's been part of it, and I think I've always sort of struggled with my putting.  It's really hard to play this game when you're not healthy.  But I think that being said, I think everyone plays it    no one plays it at 100 percent.  Everyone has a nagging problem here and there.  If you don't, that would be the exception , I think.
Q.  What in particular has been wrong with your back, or how did you injure it?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  Just more wear and tear.  I'm really loose jointed so my back    it takes a lot more effort for me to do everything because really my muscles are the only things that really keep me in place, I guess.  So what happens is it gets locked up and stops moving and it makes it hard to get through the ball.
Q.  So how much do you spend stretching every morning?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  Well, actually, I'm fairly flexible, so I actually have the opposite problem of most people.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Let's go over your scorecard.  Start with the birdie on 11.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  I made about a 20 footer there.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do you remember what you hit in?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  Let me think about that.  I have such a bad memory.  What did I hit in there?
PAUL ROVNAK:  11 is the par 5.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  I actually tried to hit 3 wood up on the green and missed it a little bit left.  I actually had a hard pitch.  I had to try to pitch it into the hill and just missed the hill and it went over the green, so I actually made it from the fringe.
PAUL ROVNAK:  So 20 feet from the fringe, you think?
KRIS TSCHETTER: Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Birdie on 13, the par 4.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  13, I made about a 3 footer.  I normally write this stuff down and I didn't today, because I have such a bad memory.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do you remember what you hit for your second shot there?
KRIS TSCHETTER:  I hit    I think I just had a sand wedge there.
PAUL ROVNAK:  And then on 17, the par 3.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  I'm sorry.  13, I hit a 7 iron.
PAUL ROVNAK:  17, the par 3.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  I hit a wedge to six feet and made it.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 1, the par 4.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  No. 1, I hit a wedge about 15 feet past and made it.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 2.
KRIS TSCHETTER:  I hit a sand wedge about four feet and made it.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you.
