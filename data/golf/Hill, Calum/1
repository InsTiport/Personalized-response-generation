  STEVE TODD:   It's been a long trip but nice way to finish it there.
 CALUM HILL:   Yeah, I think I got the most out of my score today.  There were some funky shots going on there.
 STEVE TODD:   Tell us about the round in general.  It looked windier but just talk us through what happened.
 CALUM HILL:   Yeah, it was pretty tough.  The wind was kind of strong and an awkward direction.  Played really nicely on the front nine.  Holed a lot of very important putts.  Just a few par saves and made a couple birdies and through the front, that was great.
 Played 10 and 11 okay.  Obviously made a nice putt on 11 and then had a stretch of just poor golf shots probably for the next four or five holes.  Then played the last two, which are pumping downwind, so there's less required finesse, I guess.
 Q. Tell us through 18, what happened.
 CALUM HILL:   Drive down the fairway.  Had I think 261 to the flag and hit a very good 4-iron and it landed on the upslope perfect and went to 20 feet.  Then managed to make a 20-footer.
 Q. After what went on and what you spoke about the other day and hopefully you will finish third but how good a result is that, third, after what went on prior to this week?
 CALUM HILL:   Yeah, pretty good.  I mean, from probably not playing to getting in, I'd take that at the beginning.
 Q. You've obviously had wins, but given the quality of the field, is that probably your best performance as a pro?
 CALUM HILL:   No, I'll take the wins over this.  Obviously I think competing with the likes of the field this week and doing pretty well is obviously a good achievement.
