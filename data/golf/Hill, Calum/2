  Q. So can you take me through your round today and how you felt going in today?
 CALUM HILL:   Yeah, it was all right.  It was a bit uncertain whether it was going to rain or not, so kind of weather-wise it was a bit strange.
 We certainly got the best end of it.  Massively got the best end of it over the last two days.
 Q. Yeah, for sure.
 CALUM HILL:   And then managed to take advantage of it a little, I guess.
 Q. And how do you feel about going into the weekend?  Are you confident?
 CALUM HILL:   Yeah, I should be all right.  I kind of dobbed it about a little bit more today.  I hit it better yesterday.  But then I still had plenty of chances, they just didn't -- didn't hole that well from 12 feet.  And then so, yeah, score could have been a bit better, but it was good.
 Q. And what are you going to do tonight to prepare?
 CALUM HILL:   I don't know, same as always, get some food, I guess, maybe a bit of gym and sleep.
 Q. Have fun.  Thank you.
