 Q. You told me before the round started you were probably going to fun and learn something; did you have fun and what did you learn?
 JEFF KLAUK: I did. I really enjoyed myself. I felt totally comfortable out there, which I thought I would. 
 You know, I played well. Just couldn't really get any momentum going, but made some nice putts for par, and unfortunately didn't make any for birdie. Still kept a respectable score.

 Q. The curve is supposed to take longer than this once you get out here. You are not supposed to make every cut right off the bat and then finish with a Top-5 inside of ten events. You've a little ahead of schedule. 
 JEFF KLAUK: Yeah, knowing these guys and having grown up around the TOUR, is huge. I know all everybody at the TOUR, I know a lot of the media and it just makes a big difference.

 Q. No surprises then; any situation you've been in or watched other people. 
 JEFF KLAUK: Absolutely. It's where I have always wanted to be, and a lot of fun.

 Q. Are you going to Puerto Rico?
 JEFF KLAUK: I am.
