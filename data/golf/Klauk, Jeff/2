  Q. Jeff Klauk, 3-under 69, good playing, good start to the tournament. Just talk about your round.   
 JEFF KLAUK: Yeah. It was very windy, and actually for the first few, like 10 holes it was pretty tough, I mean with the fog and the mist.   
 Normally when you play this golf course it's a little warmer, the last times I've been here at least. But the round went good, the ball wasn't traveling very far at all. (Indiscernible).   
  
  Q. Just maybe talk about your year. You've had a really good year out here.   
 JEFF KLAUK: Yeah. I've played well, and you know, being on the Nationwide Tour for so many years really prepared me well for this, the adjustment. You know, also growing up around the PGA TOUR, and you know, having known a lot of these guys before this year made the transition a lot easier.   
  
  Q. Okay. Good stuff.
