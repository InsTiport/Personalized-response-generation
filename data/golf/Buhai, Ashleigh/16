 Q.  How was your golf today?  
ASHLEIGH BUHAI: It was quite a frustrating day.  I felt like I actually hit a lot of shots like I wanted to, but the conditions just got really tough, especially on the back nine.  The greens firmed up a lot.   
I know I didn't hit bad shots, so I can't be too disappointed.  Just going to keep doing what I was doing.   
 Q.  You had been playing so well this week.  What is the strength in your golf?  
ASHLEIGH BUHAI: This week, I've been putting very good.  I got a feeling back that I had when I played well during the middle of the year.  I made a lot of good par saves, which got my rounds going the last two days.  But I've also been hitting it very well, as well.   
Today it was just very difficult to hit it close to the pins to try to make birdies.   
 Q.  Only one day left.  What do you need to play this course?  
ASHLEIGH BUHAI: Well, I think tomorrow, obviously I've got to shoot under par to have a chance to win.  Shanshan is playing very well.  Both of us I think found it tough out there today.  If the conditions are like they are today, even level par tomorrow might get the job done.  But there's a lot of golf left and just have to play the course as it comes.   
 Q.  What is your expectation for tomorrow?  
ASHLEIGH BUHAI: Two shots behind is okay.  I'm happy with that spot.  Tomorrow obviously got to try to go for the win, but it's difficult to be aggressive, especially in the greens stay firm.  I think it will be more about staying patient, and if the wind stays the way it is, par will be a pretty good score.
