  Q. Ashleigh, what a great round.  What worked for you the most this week?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   I feel like I found a little something on the range on Thursday when I played my late nine holes, and I've kind of been hitting it good but not making the putts.
 My back nine yesterday I found a little something, and I think I went 3-under on my back nine yesterday.  I took that into today and finally made a few putts.
 Q. And you played the Walmart as well as ANA Inspiration.  Where do you think your game is compared to earlier on since we came back from the pandemic?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   Well, I feel like I've been building.  Had a really good British Open.  Finished 11th there.  Walmart I was a bit tired.  Again, just been struggling with pace and getting the ball to the hole.
 Yeah, found a little something yesterday, and that's what's the difference.  I'm hitting it as good as I have been, it's just about making a few putts.
 Q. This week we were supposed to have four days of play but got narrowed down to three.  What did you do on that day off?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   I just chilled.  You know, I didn't stress.  I'm pretty laid back as it is.  I been coming here probably eight or nine years so we know the course.  The fact that it played so soft, you could just fire at the pins.  That way it made the fairways a little wider, so you just stand up and hit it and what you see is what you get.
 Q. Yeah.  A lot of players said they chilled, watched Netflix, or ate a lot of good food because Portland is known for their food.  Have you tried any of the really good local eateries around here?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   No, we've just been in an airbnb.  My husband caddies out here, so at least we were together.  We've cooked every night.  We watched U.S. Open golf the first two days in the morning, which is great with them be on the east coast.
 Yeah, just pretty relaxed, and it's been nice to just chill out.
 Q. How do you feel right now as leaders -- and your part of the leaders -- but as more come in, right now do you feel like you're in a really good spot?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   Yeah, I'm in a good spot.  I'm really happy with the way I played.  It's playing soft so birdies are out there.
 We'll just have to wait and see what happens.
 Q. And lastly, you family is overseas, correct?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   Yes, all in South Africa.
 Q. So any words of encouragement and love sent your way?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   Yeah, well hopefully they get to watch this.  We don't always get the golf over there, but I think they do, and if they are, Hello everybody.  I hope everybody is well in South Africa.
