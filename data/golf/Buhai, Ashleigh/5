  Q. Great playing today, 2-under for the championship.  How would you sum up your second day here at the U.S. Women's Open?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   You know, second day, first nine I played really steady, very solid golf, and then kind of got off to a good start on the back nine, birdied my tenth hole, which was the 1st, and then hit a few suspect iron shots, but I scrambled well and then finished strong.  Made a birdie on my 17th, which was 8, and I lipped out for birdie on the 9th, which was my No. 18.  I was just proud of how I hung in there to make those up-and-downs to keep me in it and to finish 2-under.
 Q. Now through 36 holes, both courses played.  Just how different are Cypress and Jackrabbit?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   Yeah, very different, and obviously conditions today we got lucky.  We were expecting worse.  So obviously Jackrabbit is I feel more target golf.  Greens are a bit smaller and there's a lot of long putts, whereas on Cypress obviously it plays a little bit longer.  Glad to have gotten the two courses done now and we get on to the weekend.
 Q. Looking ahead to the weekend, 2-under par very much in this championship.  How do you mentally prepare for round 3 and round 4?
 ASHLEIGH BUHAI:   Just keep doing what I'm doing and try to do a little bit better every day.  I didn't play great last week in Dallas, and it kind of scarred me a little bit, but I dug dip this week, did some video work with my coach, and we just have kept it simple, and I'm feeling a little bit more comfortable every day, so I'm hoping that's going to continue.
