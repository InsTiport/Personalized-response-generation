Q. Career low day for you; what was working well?
ASHLEY BUHAI: I hit the ball really solid.  I made a bogey on my first hole, and after that I hit 17 greens in a row.  I just kind of favored to the side of the pin that you had to, and I rolled in a few 15-footers.  I was cautious at some times, and then I knew when I could be aggressive.  Overall, good ball-striking, and you have to roll in the putts.
Q. You know you've got to stay aggressive the way the scores are this week.  Do you have to change your mindset a little bit?
ASHLEY BUHAI: Not really, because I started off, and I mean, I had birdie chances just about on every hole after the first hole, and I missed a few and I was still even, and then I just had to stay patient.  I knew I was hitting good shots, and then I birdied 7, 8 and 9, and that kind of got me going, and then made four birdies on the back.  Yeah, it was good fun.
Q. It's your first time playing in the final group on Sunday on the LPGA.  Any nerves going into tomorrow?
ASHLEY BUHAI: Yeah, there's always going to be nerves when you're trying to win a golf tournament or in a final group no matter where you're playing.  But I've known Katherine for a long time, so I think it'll be good for us being in familiar company, and I think we have a similar game.  So yeah, I look forward to it.
Q. You are the closest pursuing to Katherine Kirk.  Can you envision closing the gap and passing her tomorrow?
ASHLEY BUHAI: Obviously Katherine is playing really well.  I saw I got within one at one stage, and then I looked again, and she was back to three ahead.  She obviously made a lot of birdies, and I felt I made as many as I could, and tomorrow will be fun between the two of us.
Q. You've won a couple of times on the LET and you won earlier this year on the Sunshine Tour; how much will you lean on those experiences as you try to get it done out here on the LPGA?
ASHLEY BUHAI: Obviously the stage out here in a lot bigger, but winning is a feeling, and you've just got to take the same process going forward.  I've never been in the final group, but it'll be fun.  I know Katherine very well.
Q. Are you the kind of person that relishes being on the big stage and welcomes the challenge?
ASHLEY BUHAI: I do.  When I get my foot in the door like I have in the past, I love being in the mix and playing in front of people.  It's always good fun.
