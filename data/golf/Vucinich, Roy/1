 Q. Now this was 12th straight Senior PGA Championship. What do you feel about that is? What does that mean to you?
 ROY VUCINICH: That means that I'm playing fairly consistent golf over the years and being able to qualify for this is, no question, it gets me pretty pumped.

 Q. Over those 12 years do you have a favorite course that sticks out or a favorite tournament?
 ROY VUCINICH: No, probably where I finished my best, at Firestone, where I finished fourth in the tournament. So that obviously is my best finish in the tournament in the Senior PGA Championship. 
 But I enjoyed Ridgewood as well, but Firestone is probably No. 1.

 Q. Do you have any plans coming up here for?
 ROY VUCINICH: Try to qualify for the U. S. Senior Open. I will play local tournaments in Pittsburgh and then just keep practicing and working at it.
