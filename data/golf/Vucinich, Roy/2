 Q. This is your 12th straight championship. What does it mean for you as a club pro, to be, to represent your club and your profession in an event of this magnitude?
 ROY VUCINICH: I think being here, I always look forward to playing here and it's great for all the years that I've been playing here and participating and showing that my game's decent enough to be here and to play here. But that's pretty much it, yeah. 

 Q. You're just from across the border there in Pittsburgh, have you ever played here before?
 ROY VUCINICH: First time I've been here.

 Q. And it looked like from your scorecard that you didn't, couldn't ever really get anything going today. 
 ROY VUCINICH: Didn't get anything going, didn't hit enough fairways, I hit it in the rough a lot of times, and didn't putt very well and I finished poorly. I made the bogey, bogey, triple bogey there. And 79 or, you know, 74 or 75 would have been okay, but 79 is not very good out there today.
