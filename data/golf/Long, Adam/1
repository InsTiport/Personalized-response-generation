  Q. Just a few comments about the match.
 ADAM LONG:   It was a fun one.  I mean, it was nice to have a lead at the beginning, but playing against somebody like Kevin Na, he's not going to just give it to you.  Had to keep the pedal down a bit and I gave that one back on 14, which frustrated me, and then he makes an eagle on 16 there, and it's like, wow, all right, we're going to keep going.
 I like my position there coming down the end, but nice to finish off with a 1Â½.
 Q. What did you hit, and how good did that feel?
 ADAM LONG:   9-iron.  It felt great.  It was a pretty good number for me, just kind of take a little off a 9 and get one in there tight.  I hadn't been hitting my irons all that great, so it was nice to see one that was struck properly.
