 Q.  Another great round for you today.  Entering this tournament did you fathom, yeah, I'm going to shoot 63 twice in the first three days?  
ADAM LONG: Honestly a little bit.  I had some pretty good hopes, I guess, because I played well in my practice rounds and made a lot of birdies and felt pretty good leading up to Thursday, so I would have been surprised had I not had a good start.  But yeah, it's three awesome golf courses and you hit fairways and greens and you can make a lot of putts because these greens on all three courses are just perfect.  So you can make them from all over.   
 Q.  As a PGA TOUR rookie any experience with these courses beyond the practice rounds?  
ADAM LONG: I played here for Q-School in 2011, so, yeah, it's been a bit.  I think a junior tournament too before that.  But been here a few times, but it's a great place to play golf and, yeah, I've had good mojo here and hope to keep it going.   
 Q.  Tomorrow, not sure what the final parings are going to end up being yet, but it looks like you'll be in one of the final parings, to be sure.  Does that give you any nerves, what does that make you feel to be in one of those final groups for the first time on the PGA TOUR?  
ADAM LONG: Yeah, it will be fun, it will be exciting, it will be a challenge, it will be tough, and just try to focus on my, what I can do to have the best day I can have and try not to get too distracted by some of the other stuff going on around me and try to just mind my own game.
