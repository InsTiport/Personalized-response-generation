Q. 8-under, 62. If we can get some comments on an excellent day.
ADAM LONG: Yeah, just kind of cruise control early honestly. I hit a lot of fairways and greens and made enough putts to keep me in it. Apparently I lost by three today, so still some work to do.
Q. You had the fourth round of 62 or lower just today. At least the fourth round. Why is this course yielding very low scores today?
ADAM LONG: Honestly it's in such perfect condition. Greens are just firm enough and they're rolling so great. The fairways are same thing. You're getting enough roll out of the fairways with balls rolling out a little bit further.
Temperature is absolutely perfect. To be honest, the conditions are just setting up for it.
Q. After seeing what's happened the last two days, do you have an overall number at the end of the week that you have to get to to have a chance to win?
ADAM LONG: Not really. I mean, I think we're supposed to get some weather tomorrow maybe. You never know how that will affect things and conditions and everything. Just keep trying to make birdies. I mean, you're playing against the best players in the world here this week. You've got to keep the pedal down and keep making birdies.
