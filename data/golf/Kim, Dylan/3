 Q.  So back-to-back birdies there to close things out and get yourself to 5-under.  How were you playing today, clearly well, but how did you feel?  
DYLAN KIM: I didn't feel quite as well on the front nine, but on the back nine I hit it really well.  I hit a bunch of greens in a row really close.  I was hitting it very well on the back nine.   
 Q.  Can you tell me about your birdies, any one that particularly stood out to you or a moment where you felt strong?  
DYLAN KIM: On the last couple holes I hit a 3-wood up close and a couple wedges really close, so it was nice to get a couple birdies on the last two holes.   
 Q.  What were your expectations coming in?  We all know the story of your hip and the comeback; what were your expectations coming in?  Were you thinking about playing this well?  
DYLAN KIM: I was hoping to.  I was hoping to.  But of course it's always important to make the first cut, so I'm glad I did that.   
 Q.  How is your hip feeling?  
DYLAN KIM: It's feeling good, I have my Motrin, and it's feeling good right now.   
 Q.  Is this your first competition since then?  
DYLAN KIM: It's my first major one.  I did play the qualifier for this, but that's been the only one since September of last year.   
 Q.  And rehab's going well and you're doing good?  
DYLAN KIM: I am, yes.   
 Q.  That's the best news.  Great round today.  
DYLAN KIM: Thank you.
