 Q.  You were down early in your match, battled back.  How are you feeling with maybe the first big comeback win of the championship for you?  
DYLAN KIM: I'm feeling really good because I know that I kept my composure pretty well, and I came back from a deficit.  So it's a good feeling.   
 Q.  How were you playing out there today?  
DYLAN KIM: I hit the ball really well.  I hit the ball really well.  The putting was a bit of a struggle, but I did make a good last putt at the end to end the match, so it was good.   
 Q.  And first two-match day; are you pacing yourself through the day?  
DYLAN KIM: I am, yeah.  I'm going to take Motrin again with lunch.  So just try to stay loose, try not to sit too much and get too stiff.
