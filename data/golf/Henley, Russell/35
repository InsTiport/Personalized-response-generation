 Q.  Sixteen pars, two birdies, that sounds like a really good round in a major championship?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: It was great.  I hit the ball really well off the tee.  I probably could have gotten more out of it.  But no bogeys in the first round, I'm just going to take it and keep it.   
 Q.  Talking to John Senden, he said he thought conditions changed a little bit.  The wind kicked up.  It was hard to figure out the second nine, because you played the back nine first and then made the turn.  Did you feel the same thing with the winds?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: I think the greens got a lot firmer on the back, which was my -- the real front nine.  Definitely the wind was hard to judge.  I felt like sometimes it would knock it down and sometimes it wouldn't touch it as much.  It's hard to know the exact direction.   
I felt like I judged it prey well, though, and hit it on the correct side of the hole and obviously made a ton of pars.   
 Q.  We like to find out from you guys what you think of the course setup.  Fair test today?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: I thought it was.  I think definitely it was harder in the afternoon with the greens firming up.  Got a little bit -- I'm not going to say baked out, but just a little bit firmer.  The first hop was bouncing out a little bit than my first couple of holes.  Just playing for that was tough.  But I think it's a great setup, very fair.  If you hit a good shot there, you get rewarded.
