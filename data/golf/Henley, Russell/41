  RUSSELL HENLEY:   I enjoyed the day.   I didn't put a lot of pressure on myself to do anything crazy, I just tried to pick good targets and trust that I was hitting the right club and just accept whatever happened.   
   
 Q.   What did you learn from last year going into this year?  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Well, I learned a lot my first year.   But last year I played really well the first two days and just kind of got it‑‑ not awful on the weekend, but finished around 30th.  
I think all the times I've played it, combined, have helped me realize like where I can and can't hit it.   I know that seems like a clichÃ© answer.   But it's so important to hit it in the right spots.   I feel like I can give myself a chance to save par if I know that.  
Almost the more you play the comfortable you are with it, it doesn't mean there's still not pressure and still not a major, and still not hard.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the first round and your nerves.  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, this year the nerves were not as bad as the first two years, I don't know why.   I just felt a little more comfortable.   Definitely had some nerves, but I was actually able to feel like I was in control of my body, when in the past I felt like everything was just flying around crazy.  
So I felt a lot more comfortable today than I have in the past.   And just tried to keep a good attitude.   
   
 Q.   Is this the round you were hoping for in terms of your expectations?  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I definitely wasn't expecting to shoot any particular round.   I was trying not to.   I think anytime you can shoot under par out here it's a good score, it means you're doing a lot of things right.  
So I have a lot of confidence from last week.   I hit the ball really well last week and it showed up on the stats.   And I think when I struggle with my ball‑striking ‑‑ hopefully it won't be in the future.   I just took confidence from last week and rolled with it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, well, it showed progress last fall in the playoffs, started working with him and for a little while there had a couple of things I wanted to change.   And once I got comfortable with those I finished second up in Boston, finished 12th Tour Championship, almost won in Hyundai and Maui.   I've had a couple of good tournaments since I worked with him and he's helped me tremendously.
