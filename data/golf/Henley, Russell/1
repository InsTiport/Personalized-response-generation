Q. 6-under 65.  Nice round.  Just get some comments if we can.
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, I had a really hot first nine, which is the back nine.  A lot of birdie opportunities on that side with the par-5s, drivable par-4.  So took advantage of those.
And then front nine, I didn't really hit it that bad.  It's just a little harder, you know, one less par-5, and finish with a 3-putt.  So kind of disappointing finish, but I'm really happy how my game feels and it was fun to get out there for a little bit.
Q. Take us a through the eagle on 13.
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, I just hit a little cut drive down there and it was a little downwind at the time, and hit a hybrid on.  I got a nice bounce and just tried to get about a 30-footer close and somehow went in.
