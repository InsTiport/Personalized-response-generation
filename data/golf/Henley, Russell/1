  Q. (No Microphone.)
 RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, feel like I hit my driver a little bit better than yesterday.  I feel like I putted nicely, had some nice par saves, played pretty steady.  I had a nice birdie on 11.  Hit it close, put some pressure on him.  And I ended up winning the hole and that was a big putt in the match, as I look back on it I went from 1-up and then all of a sudden I was 3-up.  So overall I feel pretty good about my game.  And it's always tough to win matches.  I think it's just my second win in the two times I've been here with this course.  So just thankful for the win.
