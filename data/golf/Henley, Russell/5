Q. Russell, let's start with the second shot on 18.  How good did that look?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   It was right where I wanted to hit it.  Trying it hit up the middle of the green.  Landed on the front of the green.  I think I landed it a foot on, so that was really nice.  That's a tricky hole or tricky second shot in there when you hit the fairway.  And I've hit also a lot of bad shots on that hole, too, so it was nice to hit one to a foot and get in with a 3.
Q. You're sixth straight round on Tour sub-70.  What's been clicking in your game?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Been making more putts.  I feel confident on the greens, and I've been hitting it pretty much the same for a while, pretty consistently.  So I just holed a few more putts I think and that gives me a little momentum.
Q. Coming in where you are in the FedExCup standings, does it maybe allow you to maybe be freed up a little bit more to try to make those birdies?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I think so.  This is my fifth in a row, and I've tried to play the last few just so I can maybe the Top-125 and guarantee my good status for next year.
So for a while there I wasn't in the top 125.  So now that I'm in the Playoffs, you know I'm just trying to compete the best that I can, so we'll see what happens.
