Q.   You posted that beautiful number with a double bogey on your card, when you made the turn at 6â€‘under.   What clicked for you on that back nine?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Well, I hit a really bad tee shot on 7 and that's my tendency when I'm playing bad is to hit my driver a little off line. 
But Casey told me to keep swinging hard and being aggressive and don't get tentative just because we had that one bad swing. 
I always feel pretty confident with my putter, hopefully I can keep feeling comfortable and confident the rest of the week.   But I felt really comfortable with the putter and rolling in some pretty good par saves. 

Q.   You mentioned the word "comfort," this is your second PLAYERS, you made the cut last year, how much more comfortable are you here in this championship compared to last season?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I think I have my life a little bit more in perspective than last year.   I thought that this was like the biggest thing going, but I feel like I'm just trying to enjoy the opportunity.   It's beautiful weather down here and getting to play with some guys, a great group, and I got a lot of great people around mere.

Q.   With that perspective is that what why you've had success this year?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I'm getting more and more comfortable out here and realizing what works for me and what doesn't work.   A lot of these older guys, the guys you see playing really consistently they have figured out what works for them and they just kind of stick with it.   I'm still figuring out what mine is. 

Q.   Well played.   Nine birdies on this golf course. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I putted really well, made some long par saves, and the putter kept my round going and just felt pretty comfortable today. 

Q.   I've gotten to see you play a lot of golf, saw you win at Sony, at the Honda, couple of things always impress me about your game, one, you can absorb a double bogey, you made one today at the 7th.   You made one down the stretch at Honda and still you come back and post a good number.   That is really impressive to me. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, it's not easy.   It's definitely frustrating to make dumb mistake and make bad swings.   As much work as everybody puts in out here, whenever you hit one as off line, as we do, sometimes it can be frustrating.   I think I have just done it so many times I'm learning how to deal with it.

Q.   Another thing you do so well, it's really easy to put the guide on the ball off the tee here, I always see you take a hard swipe at the ball?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   That helps me, helps the club stay in front of me better.   I never really had any success swinging the club smooth or going 75 percent or whatever they teach you growing up.   I never looked back and a round and said, oh, I swung smooth today and played great.   I always looked back and said I was swinging pretty aggressive, and for some reason that really works for me.

Q.   That's pretty easy to say, but you got to trust your swing to do that. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   You got to accept the fact that it's never going to be perfect.   That's always the thing I'm struggling with and I struggle with, just trying not to be too perfect out here.   You just got to take a rip at it and let it go.

Q.   You played here last year as a rookie, what can you apply from last year to this year's tournament?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Well, I think I'm a little bit different player this year.   I'm a little more comfortable.   I think I know my game a little bit better and hopefully I can make the weekend and have a good next three days. 

Q.   I think your bank account's even bigger than last year too?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Maybe. 

Q.   Play well. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   All right.   Thanks.   FastScripts by ASAP
