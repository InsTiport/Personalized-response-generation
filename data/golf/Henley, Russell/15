Q. How would you assess the day?
RUSSELL HENLEY: I think anything under par is great.  I mean, that's what I kind of was thinking at the start of the day.  It's hard out there.  The par 3s on the back, all the par 3s, are real really hard.  Not much room for error.
Q. What's the biggest challenge of all those that are presented to you out there?
RUSSELL HENLEY: I think picking the right club and missing it in the correct spot.  I mean, I was off on some clubs today.  I don't know really why.  Just picked the wrong one.  Hard to judge the wind.
I feel like it was hard sometimes, or it would lighten up a little bit and there's not much room for error on these par 3s where there's such a small landing area and the greens are firm.  You just have to hang in there.
Q. When you come back to a place you've won before, can you tap into memories from 2014 that can help you this week?
RUSSELL HENLEY: Yeah, in 2014, I felt like I hung around.  I didn't feel like I was playing unbelievable.  I definitely made some mistakes.  Everybody is going to this week.  I just hung around and just never gave up and I was standing at the end.  Try it take that mind-set around here.  It's such a hard course, you've got to be patient.
