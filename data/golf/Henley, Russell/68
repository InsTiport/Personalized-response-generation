Q.   What's the biggest pinch me moment you've had? 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, I mean, it all seems kind of fate out here. 
The coolest thing was when Jack Nicklaus walked off the tee and winked at me and said, "How's it going?"   Gary Player introduced himself and said it's great to see how well you are playing.   So it's cool to, you know, be noticed and have your moment with them.   It's pretty special. 

Q.   This has been a fun and relaxing time so far.   How do you turn the knob and head into tomorrow?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Trying to get it all out of my system right now.   I'm ready to play.   I'm ready to‑‑ I think I'm playing well, ready to play well, ready to get out there.   The whole practice round stuff has been fun, but I'm ready to compete.

Q.   Did you tell Adam to hit the ball or was he not wanting to? 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   No, he wanted to.   I had to double‑check.   I didn't know if I was going to be‑‑ it worked out good.   He hit a pretty good one.

Q.   And then the chip, it looked like it‑‑
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I don't know where that came from.   I'm just glad I didn't trip over the tee marker thing. 

Q.   What was it like having Adam out there caddying again for you?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   It was cool.   He's fun.   He's loose and just always fun to do anything with him.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I was a little jittery, but I'm ready to go now.   I'm ready to not worry about it now.   I'm ready to go.

Q.   What do you make of the first Masters for the youngster tomorrow as well as your first? 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   You know, I think he's just going to be really excited.   It should be fun.
