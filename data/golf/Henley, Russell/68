 Q.   How did it go today?  
    RUSSELL HENLEY:   It went well.   I went out and wasn't really too concerned with how I was shooting or anything, I was just excited to be back after two weeks off.   And the game feels good.   And I had a pretty good score.  
   
 Q.   Looks like it's perfect out there?  
    RUSSELL HENLEY:   Perfect.   The fairways are perfect.   You hit a good shot, you get rewarded.   It's definitely a challenging course.   You hit good shots, you get rewarded and that's what makes a great course, I think.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
    RUSSELL HENLEY:   I don't know.   I don't want to change too much.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
    RUSSELL HENLEY:   They're pretty much perfect.   You get one hop and stop unless you're playing after a ridge out there, which there are plenty of those.   They're perfect firmness right now.   It's getting windy.   I think it's getting windy tomorrow, I think it's going to get more and more tough.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
    RUSSELL HENLEY:   Probably my mental game.   I hit the ball well off the tee, but I had a couple of threeâ€‘putts on the front nine.   I stayed positive and didn't beat myself up, and allowed me to have a good back nine.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
    RUSSELL HENLEY:   We had a couple of good conversations last hole, a couple of good decisions last hole.   We picked the right club and got rewarded for it.   I think Murray gives me confidence.   My attitude throughout the day was very positive.  
   
 Q.   You're going to be following Tiger the rest of the day?  
    RUSSELL HENLEY:   Not really too much.   I can't really control what they do.   I'm just going to play good again tomorrow.
