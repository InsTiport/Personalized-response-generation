  Q. You started the week outside of the top 100 and you've played your way into the BMW.  How proud are you of what you've done?
 RUSSELL HENLEY:   I'm thankful.  Like I've said so many times, it's good golf out here; you are working hard to shave off a stroke or a half a stroke every day.  It's just such a grind.  Sometimes I wake up Sunday morning, and I'm like, I can't believe I have another day of golf to play.  It's just so much golf and there's so many ebbs and flows.
 I'm thankful.  I felt really confident with my game.  I felt confident lately tee-to-green, and on the greens, and I feel pretty good.  So it was nice to come back after a rough start today and that's what I'm most proud of.
 Q. With the start that you did get off to, was there a point in the round where you felt like you needed to get into a bit of a desperation mode?
 RUSSELL HENLEY:   I knew I was playing well, but honestly after I made bogey on 4, I felt like walking in.  But yeah, you feel like you've got to be more aggressive for sure but I just knew that if I played my game, hit fairways and picked the right targets, I just need to keep giving myself looks.
 You know, it was a heck of a finish.
 Q. As you move on to Chicago, what are you happiest about your game right now?
 RUSSELL HENLEY:   I'm starting to putt a little better.  I feel like I've been working on the right things and seen a little bit of improvement.  Not quite as kept as I wanted, but feel good about that and physically I feel good.  I haven't always felt great physically this late in the season, and I don't have really any pain in my body, so it's been great.
