Q. Thank you, Russell.  Solid finishing round.  Did you know an Open Championship spot was on the line coming down the stretch?
RUSSELL HENLEY: I did.  I was more focused on trying to make birdies and catch up with those guys.  Always something to play for and that definitely makes it exciting and feels good.
Q. How excited are you, this will be your fourth trip over to The Open Championship.  You finished tied for 20th.  Played well over there.  Does that give you a little bit of extra motivation as well?
RUSSELL HENLEY: It is.  I love going over there.  It's a lot of fun to play a little bit different type of golf than what we're used to, just be challenged.  I love the opportunity and I'm excited and hopefully I can go there and play well again.
