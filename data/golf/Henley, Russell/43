Q.   Russell, obviously with the change in the wind and the conditions it was kind of a day where you had to hang in there, but you hung in there fairly well, too. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, I did.   I misjudged a couple of chips and wedge shots and a couple of wrong clubs off the tee with the wind switch, but overall my game feels great, and I'm just excited to be playing.

Q.   Kind of took the scenic route down the 12th. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I did.   Tough tee shot.   That's what I've been doing this week for some reason and the wind was over turning it.   Just couldn't get comfortable, but other than that, I drove it pretty awesome today.

Q.   Yeah, I thought your swing looks good, and you really kind of stayed in the moment as well.   I thought there was a chance for you to get frustrated out there, and it never appeared‑‑ your body language is good is what I'm trying to say. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah.   I've been trying to keep a good attitude.   I know that my game is good, so if I can keep a good attitude and stay even keel, I feel like the results will come.

Q.   University of Georgia, not in the National Championship, but do you have any thoughts on Monday's football game?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Man.   Well, both teams looked great.   If I had to guess who was going to win, I would say Oregon has a pretty good chance, but you just never know. 

Q.   Just a couple of thoughts on how it went out there today. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Every time I got something going I kind of made a dumb mistake, didn't capitalize on a couple of good attempts from my good wedge shots on the Back 9, and then on the last hole probably could have hit that chip a little closer.   I misjudged it and just thought it was going to be faster.   So a couple of things, but overall I've been playing great.   I just gotta score just a little bit better.

Q.   We talked a lot on Friday about your swing changes and making some adjustments and stuff.   Just curious how that's holding up and how you're feeling. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah.   It's good.   I hit some great shots today.   Hit my driver great.   I hit one kind of tough drive into the wind on one hole, but I mean I feel great over the ball and really happy with how I'm hitting it.   Like I said, I just gotta score a little better.

Q.   How does it feel to come right out of the gates on a new year and be right in the mix on a final day?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   It feels good.   I don't know if I'm in the mix.   I think I'm a couple off the lead, but a little disappointing I left a couple out there, but at the same time I know I'm close, so it feels good. 

Q.   It was kind of different wind today; right, coming the opposite direction?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, it was.   I mean 1 was really hard.   I thought 1 was‑‑ I mean I think Moon hit a hybrid in, and I was in the bunker.   I got delayed, obviously. 
It was a lot different on some holes, but some holes I misjudged.   Like 9 I should have hit like a 3‑iron or 5‑wood off the tee and hit at the top of the hill and I've never played with that wind, so I hit a 3‑wood too far and that didn't let me get to the green.   So just a couple of little things I did wrong with the wind.   But my game is good, though.   I feel good about my game.
