RUSSELL HENLEY: Hopefully fix this problem for this week.  But hit it in the fairway and gave me a lot of opportunities.
Q. What's the key for you on this golf course?
RUSSELL HENLEY: I think just hit tee shots.  I feel like if you can -- most of the time if you can put the ball in the fairway you can be pretty aggressive to the flag with the conditions we're going to have.  If it firms up that might change a little bit.
Playing out of the fairway this week is huge.
Q. A lot players of talk about how cool it was and then it warmed up.  How much did that affect your golf game out there today?
RUSSELL HENLEY: Yeah, you expect it to go a lot further when it gets warm out here.  This morning I was probably a club shorter than the afternoon.  You got to adjust as the day goes on and err on the right side of hole.
Nothing we haven't done before and stuff we should be good at.
