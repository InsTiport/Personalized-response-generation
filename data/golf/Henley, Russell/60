 Q.   What a roller coaster ride for you, you chip‑in at 14, you hit it in the water at 15.   Did you think your chances of winning this golf tournament were done?  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   So much can happen these last couple holes, and you know, that's been my thing this week.   My attitude has been great.   I haven't been hitting it perfect.   A couple times I've hit in some funky spots and I've managed to clean it up nice and get up‑and‑down.   
I told Ace, I said, no matter what, I'm going to hang in there the best I can, make good golf swings and I've got nothing to lose playing against these guys.  
So this is kind of out of nowhere how I've been playing lately and I just really tried to soak up the day and everything I could take out of it.  
   
 Q.   You have your eagle putt to win the golf tournament in the playoff hole, you lag it up to within three feet and you immediately point up in the stands.   Who was that for?  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Craig Harmon.   He was over there behind the green.   He came out to see me today.   He's been helping me out a little bit lately, and I just saw him standing over there and I just‑‑ he's helped me a lot.
