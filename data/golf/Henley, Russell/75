Q.   People say sometimes it's not as hard to win this first one.   You don't know how hard it is.   You made it look easy out there. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Did I?   It felt pretty hard.   Yeah, that was definitely 10 times as nervous as I've ever been.   I was just trying to stick to my routine and stay committed and stay in the present. 

Q.   Nervous must be good because you really played well coming down the stretch, birdieing the last five. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, you know, that was just me trying to focus on my routine and letting the shot go and not trying to guide it or help it, and that's kind of one of the tendencies I have under pressure.   Just trying to play free golf.

Q.   You know you're in the Masters already, but did you know you're probably in the Match Play now?   Top 50 in the World Rankings. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Well, I don't know.   I'm going one tournament at a time and enjoy this one right now.
