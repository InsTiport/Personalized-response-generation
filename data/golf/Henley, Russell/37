Q. Talk about your round.
RUSSELL HENLEY: It was pretty calm on the front nine and picked up as my back nine went on.  I thought the last couple holes were -- the wind was picking up a lot and 18 was playing really hard just now, so it will be a good test this afternoon if the wind stays as it is.
Q. (No Microphone.)
RUSSELL HENLEY: I'm making progress.  This is my most consistent year with cuts made on the TOUR.  This is my third year out here.  Obviously everybody wants to win Majors and compete in Majors and win as much as Tiger, but I'm just focusing on getting a little better every year and I feel like I've been doing that.
Q. (No Microphone.)
RUSSELL HENLEY: The U.S. Amateur?
Q. Yeah, the U.S. Amateur.
RUSSELL HENLEY: Well, I think it puts a lot of pressure on you playing match play, playing against a lot of guys who are playing well and who are all planning on turning pro.  I think it's a perfect way to end your amateur career, for sure, but the U.S. Amateur, I didn't do particularly well in U.S. Amateurs, but I played pretty well at Erin Hills and all those amateur tournaments, they're great.
Q. (No Microphone.)
RUSSELL HENLEY: Very difficult.  Like the last couple holes, when the wind was picking up, it really makes it a lot different course.  The greens are receptive, were receptive this morning and pretty receptive this afternoon, but when you're hitting 3-irons short of a par-4 in two, I don't experience that that much, I'm not that short of a hitter, so it can be very challenging and you just got to hit it in the right places.  There's places to miss it out there, you just have to know where they are.
Q. (No Microphone.)
RUSSELL HENLEY: I made some good par putts today, I would say.
