 Q.   Russell, I think that, because your year started the way that it started, we all forget this is still your rookie year on the PGA Tour.   But this is actually a golf course that you have played.   You played The Open here a couple of years ago.   How nice was it to come back?   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   It's nice.   Every time I've played, it's been in perfect shape.   It's always a great test, great fair test of golf.   It's a tough golf course.   
Any time you can make a bunch of pars and throw in a few birdies out there, it's a great round.  
   
 Q.   Was there any difference in your preparation from when you were here for a U.S. Open or for this week, knowing that maybe you have to go a little lower this week than maybe in a U.S. Open?   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, I mean, I still try to stick to my game plan and just play the course how I want to play it.   I can't control how I score.   I can just control the decisions I make around this place.   Hopefully, I can hit the ball on the fairway.   That's the most important part.   Just trying to stay patient is the main thing.  
   
 Q.   Are you having fun out there?   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I had a great time today.   Hopefully, I'll have a couple more.  
   
 Q.   Adam said that you guys, coming down 18, he didn't think there was any way you guys were going to finish today.   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   It looks pretty bad.   In the distance, there was a lot of dark clouds, and we got lucky.  
   
 Q.   You did get lucky, but you also played well.   A couple under par to start things out on Thursday.   Go get 'em on Friday.   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Thanks a lot.
