Q.   Nine birdies, just one other.   Can you talk about your round, it looks like you started off pretty well. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I did.   I got off to a good start of the I felt really comfortable on the greens today.   I made some good par saves that kept my round going.   Kept it smooth. 
As long as I keep feeling comfortable with the putter, I think I can putt well on these greens.   Hopefully, I can do that for the next three days.

Q.   Did you feel that you were clicking on the back nine?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   A little bit.   I didn't really notice.   I knew I was playing well and felt really comfortable on the greens, but it was one of those back nines where you kind of get to 18 and I just realized that I had a putt for 7‑under.   So that was pretty cool. 
But it didn't really hit me until the last hole.

Q.   Is that sometimes the key out here, to make those par putts to keep that round going?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I think it is.   I thought I made a really good swing on 13, just left of the flag, and it went over.   I was up against the other side of a drain and had a really tough up‑and‑down.   Felt like I had hit a pretty good shot and it wound up in a pretty bad spot. 
So to come out with par was nice.   It felt like that's not what I should have made on the hole, but that's golf.

Q.   How were the greens overall today?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   They're perfect.   They roll very true and very healthy and just like last year they're some of the best greens we play all year. 

Q.   Does it feel different when you're swinging like that, the body feel different, the mind feel different?
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I think I feel comfortable, the more you play and work on the same things with your game, you get comfortable out here.   I felt comfortable, I didn't really feel that nervous, I just tried to just keep it going and even if I made a bogey or double or whatever, just stayed positive, because I know I'm playing well, it's going to add up in the end.

Q.   (No Microphone.)
RUSSELL HENLEY:   It's hard to.   Everybody out here works on their game so much.   When you hit a shot like that, it definitely‑‑ I'm kind of a perfectionist, I try not to be, but I think everybody else is out here too.   But you try not to think about it anymore, but it's hard not to.   You got to use it as motivation.
