Q. Some comments on the day?
RUSSELL HENLEY: Yeah, it was a windier day than yesterday.  Hit it well off the tee.  Just tried to stay patient and just tried to control what I'm doing.  Nice to make a putt on the last hole.  I feel like I had a good shot in there, and didn't quite get as close to the hole as I wanted, but a good way to finish.
Q. Talk about your mindset going into tomorrow.
RUSSELL HENLEY: I think Paul won today, so that's two wins for him.  I can't really control that match tomorrow.  I'll try to do the same thing tomorrow, stick to my game plan and do the best that I can.  You've got to win every match.  And I put myself a little behind not winning yesterday.  But I still like where my game is.
