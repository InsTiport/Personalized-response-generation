 Q.  Birdied 17 and 18 today.  That was a heck of a finish.  You got to be proud of that?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: I am.  I kind of had an unfortunate shot on my layup on 15 and made me mad.  Felt there was maybe a little mud on it.  I felt like I hit a solid shot and look up and it's about 40 yards left of where I was looking.  Unfortunate, but maybe I made a bad swing.  We'll never be sure.   
Yeah, I love how I finished.  I hit great shots coming in, right on my targets.   
 Q.  Now you're in the final group on Sunday.  Chance to win this thing.  You wanted a chance to win and you got it.  
RUSSELL HENLEY: Making the two birdies was good for me, and hopefully I can continue that tomorrow.  Got to stay patient.  Probably going to be tough conditions again tomorrow and got to do one shot at a time.   
 Q.  How hard are the greens to not only judge the the speed but just to read, because they look pretty quick?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: Yeah.  Some holes are more exposed to the wind and some holes I feel like you have to hit them so soft that you got to maybe play a little extra break or let the wind move in it one direction.  They are getting pretty tough.  The hardest thing is hitting right club, not greens.   
 Q.  Good luck tomorrow.  We'll see you out there.  
RUSSELL HENLEY: Thank you.
