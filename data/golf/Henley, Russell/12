 Q.  Today 67, but you did show off the short game a little bit there coming in to make sure you didn't make a bogey all day.  
RUSSELL HENLEY: Yeah, had some pretty soft, ball was going into the hole really nice speed and some pretty harsh lipouts on three of them, actually.  I couldn't believe it didn't drop.  So could have made a couple more putts, but to end with two up-and-downs like that was nice.  I felt a little bit weird over the shots coming in, put me in some bad spots, but it was nice to have the short game to back me up.   
 Q.  Considering the conditions today, we had a little bit of rain, little mist, cooler conditions, how good was your 67?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: Yeah, it was steady.  Like I said, I lipped out a couple putts I feel like I could have made.  Hit some nice putts, hit the ball well, gave myself a lot of chances, and if I can just keep doing that, that will be nice.   
 Q.  The recipe for catching Casey tomorrow after he shot 62 today?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: Yeah, obviously, 62 was out there today, softer conditions, and he's a heck of a player.  But I can't be worried about what he's doing.  I can't control it, so I'm just going to do the best I can.   
 Q.  How would you assess your round out there today?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: Had some nice saves coming down the stretch, but I felt pretty solid.  Hit a lot of greens again, and didn't quite take advantage of the opportunities I had.  I had a couple harsh lipouts.  But overall, it was a pretty solid round.   
 Q.  Did you look how far back you are for par and think you can get out there tomorrow and if there's a low number there for you tomorrow?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: I think I can shoot a low number on this course.  You've got to make the putts.  I'm definitely hitting it well enough, and if I can get a couple putts to fall, that would be good.  But I can't control what he's doing.  I can just try to keep playing solid.   
 Q.  Will it be helpful being in the same group as him, or would you rather be in the group behind because it looks like you're going to play with him tomorrow?  
RUSSELL HENLEY: Yeah, it doesn't make a difference to me whether I play with him or not.  But it means I'm doing something right if I'm in the last group on Sunday, so I'm excited to play.
