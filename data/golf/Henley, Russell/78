Q.   I don't think you have to worry about missing the cut tomorrow.   Just don't get ahead of yourself and play one shot at a time, and I think that's what you guys have figured out pretty early in your careers. 
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, I think so.   We've played a lot of competitive golf against each other, and it's high stakes, and I got out there on the Web.com TOUR, and that's the best thing that's ever happened to me is playing a full year out there and learning a lot about myself.   I'm just excited to be here. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Yeah, I think so.   You know, I think there was a lot of nerves for me the first few holes and I think playing with Scotty and Luke was huge for me, and watching them play well kind of gave me a goal to try to keep up with them, so it was definitely fun feeding off them.
