 Q.   In the darkness here at PGA National, the last man standing, how can you put into words what happened over the course of the last five or six hours?   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Wow, I don't know, I still can't believe I'm standing here.   It was a rush to be out there playing with Rory and the crowd.   I've never played or been a part of a crowd so big cheering for me.   It was just an amazing feeling.   
I was doing my best to hit some good shots for them and try to get them going.   I feel like I kind of did that, and you know, it was so much fun.   I hope I can have a bunch more Sundays just like that in my career.   
   
 Q.   How were you able to adjust to the highs and the lows, especially in the back nine, a couple of birdies and issues at 15.   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Been like that all week.   Obviously got off to a great start, but I haven't hit it in the best spots around this golf course but I've just been confident in my short game.   I wasn't going to let one hole bother me that much.   
Obviously hit it in the one place you couldn't hit it on 15 but I knew I had three to go, and I was just going to hang tough the best I can no matter what happened.     
   
 Q.   2014, a little bit of a struggle coming into this week, how are you better prepared now than when you won in Sony right out of the gate.   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Well, I think I've learned, especially last year taught me a lot about myself, what I need to do to be successful out here.   I've surrounded myself with some really good people, and I'm just doing my best to keep working hard and stay humble and just enjoy it.   
Like I was telling some guys last night, this isn't who I am; this is just a game I'm playing.   If I can keep that attitude, I'll be out here for a while.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your mind‑set coming into the playoff, it was so whacky with a four‑way, what were you thinking on the 18th tee again?   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I was just thinking, what else can I do besides hit two good golf shots and swing the club the best I can two times.   I knew if I hit a good drive, I could get there just before and pulled a 5‑wood.   
I knew exactly what I had to do and I just focused on being really exact with what I want to do off the tee, really good target and same with coming into the green.   That's all I've been trying to do all week is just make the best swing I can and then go chase it.  
   
 Q.   With the crazy crowds, did that help focus you?   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   Absolutely.   I love playing in front of the crowd.   I love when people get going and get engaged with the tournament and I've always been that way.   Man, it's so much fun playing for everybody and I'm just‑‑ hopefully everybody else had a great time out there, too.   
   
 Q.   What does this win mean to you?  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   It means a lot.   Obviously it has not been the best start to the year, and end of last year wasn't my best, but I've grown a lot as a person, as a player, and I think this one just shows me that maybe I'm doing some good stuff and I just need to keep doing it.   
   
 Q.   What's the emotion like for you right now?  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   I'm just kind of in shock.   I really don't know what to say.   I'm definitely very excited and maybe it will sink in next month or the month after, but obviously it's not the best start to my year and to get a win this early is definitely not exactly way was expecting but I know I can do it.  
   
 Q.   Now yesterday you told us, talking about Rory, you're not going to pay attention to what he does on the course.   How hard was it for you to not look at the leaderboard throughout the day?   
RUSSELL HENLEY:   You know, I tried to not look that much, because I knew it was playing tough.   I knew what I needed to do.   So was not really going to change my game plan that much unless I'm coming down 18 and need to do something.   
Rory makes it look so easy, hits it long and hits it straight and it just looks effortless.   You know, it's tough and you're really, really nervous watching something like that happen.   
   
 Q.   And then obviously ‑‑ what's it like, all these fans out here cheering for you, what was it like playing in front of such a big crowd?  
RUSSELL HENLEY:   One of the biggest rushes of my life and hopefully I get to do it again.   Everybody was going crazy it felt like the entire day.   It was a lot of fun.   I wish every day was like that.
