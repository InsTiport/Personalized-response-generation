Q. You had 7 birdies, 5-under par, 66.  What did the golf course play like out there?
RUSSELL HENLEY: Perfect.  Light breeze.  Warm.  Sunny.  Perfect greens and fairways.  It was great.  You know, rolled in a couple putts.  Long way to go.

RUSSELL HENLEY: Definitely adds pressure.  Everybody wants to make it to the Tour Championship.  I think it's a special tournament.  I've been to it once and it's really fun and plus where I grew up.  Be great to make it but only thing I can really control is what I'm doing and I'm going to try to play good.
Q. What was the key for you today?
RUSSELL HENLEY: Rolling in a couple putts and couple good par saves.  Just mentally I felt like I was doing well.
