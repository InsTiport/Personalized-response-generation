  JOHN BUSH:   Okay, we'd like to welcome Chad Campbell into the interview room after a 23‑under par 68, currently tied for the lead at 7‑under par.   Chad, if we could get some comments on your round today?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Yeah, felt really good out there, especially on the front nine, hit a lot of good shots.   I turned 2‑under, and then struggled a little bit on the back nine in some spots and I had a three‑putt there on 13, but some good up‑and‑downs to save par on 17, and also there on 16.   So I m   happy with my round, and looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Right now there's 25 guys within four shots of the lead.   What does that mean for tomorrow?   What's it going to take?   It seems like an awful lot of guys.   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   It is.   It's kind of jammed in there.   So, you don't really know.   You know, if the wind blows kind of like the way it is today, 2‑under hasn't been a bad score all week.   So it's kind of hard to say.   You just have to go out there, go with your game plan and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Chad, you shot 61 here before.   How comfortable do you feel on this course?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   You know, I love this golf course.   It's one of my favorites all year, I come out here and play quite a bit during the year even when I'm home.   So I'm pretty comfortable on it, and I obviously enjoy playing here.  
   
 Q.   I just wanted to follow up, because there are so many guys, does that mean that you might have to be a little bit more aggressive than normal just because there are so many other guys that are trying?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   It's hard to say.   You've really got to get out there and see how it's going.   You can kind of tell with the rounds early in the day.   Today the guys early in the day shot some really good scores.   I know Kevin Chappell had a good round, 6‑ or 7‑under, I believe.   But the winds are tricky out there.   I think that's why the scores are maybe a little bit higher than they are in the past, but the course is in awesome shape, and it's playing tough.  
   
 Q.   Did anything change much after the weather delay in terms of course conditions that affected you at all?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   I only had one hole, but not really.   The tee shot on 18 the wind wasn't blowing much, but we got to the fairway and it had already picked up back to where it was, so really not much changed.   I don't think there is enough rain to change it too much.  
   
 Q.   Could you see this tournament coming the way you've played?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Honestly, I felt like I've been playing okay all year.   I haven't been able to play two weeks in a row much this year.   I've kind of played one week and had two or three or a month off.   It's been kind of hard for me.   It's nice to be able to play last week and have a little momentum coming into this week.   Not that I played great last week, but just being able to carry some things over.  
   
 Q.   Being a competitor, Chad, how much are the juices flowing right now being back in contention?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   It's nice.   It's been a little while.   In Jackson last year I had a chance, but I don't think I held the lead after 54, but I might not today but I know I'll be around it somewhere.   But it's nice to be back in contention and seeing some of the hard work pay off.
