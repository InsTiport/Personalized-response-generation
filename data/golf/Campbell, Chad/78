 Q.  Another successful match in round three.  Talk me through the round. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  It was a tough day out there.  Me and David didn't play as well as we would have liked.  It was tough conditions out there, and we kind of survived and I was able to win 1-up. 

 Q.  Do you prefer these conditions?  Leading into tomorrow, would you rather have the conditions of today or conditions of the first two days? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  I don't have control over it, but obviously I'd like to play in a little better weather. 
 Whatever it brings tomorrow, we'll do it.  I heard it's supposed to be a little better but not great.  We'll just come out and deal with it. 

 Q.  Talk to me about your quarterfinal. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, Stephen Ames.  He's obviously playing very well, won most of his matches pretty easily.  He's playing really well right now, so it's going to be tough. 

 Q.  36 holes; in contention for tomorrow and Sunday; does that leap into your head at all? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  No, not really.  Hopefully that's the way it works out.  A couple good rounds tomorrow and then I'll have a chance to win hopefully on Sunday. 

 Q.  Tiger's streak ended about 15 minutes ago.  Do you have any perspective on seven wins and losing in the third round here? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  That's pretty impressive.  This is a tough tournament to keep that streak alive, having to beat individual players every day.  You know, it's tough. 
 Obviously he's the best player in the world and it was great playing by Nick.  I didn't obviously know what was going on out there, but obviously great to be able to knock him off.
