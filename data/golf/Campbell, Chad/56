 Q. First let's talk about your round. What happened in between there and finishing strong?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, obviously I played well on the back. Front nine, you know, birdied the 1st hole. Three and four, you know, made bogeys there. You know, I was able to come back on the back nine. That was, you know, close to a decent round.

 Q. Pretty windy out there. How much does that effect your play?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: It was a little windy, it was tougher than the last three days for sure. Made it a little tougher. Birdies weren't coming quite as quick.

 Q. The weather has been different here over the last four days with rain and the heat and everything like that. Is that kind of hard to get adjusted to or is that something that you are used to?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: No, you know, you kind of get used to it. When you are playing golf, you always get all sorts of weather. Pretty common. Overall, I think the weather was pretty good. Happy to see it.

 Q. Sounds good. Thanks.
