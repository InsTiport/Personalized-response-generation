  Q. Especially on a day with the wind, it really started picking up this afternoon.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: It did, you know, a little bit. A little bit of a different direction. It didn't blow very much earlier in the week.   
 Happy with the week. Wish I had played those three holes in the middle of the back nine a little better. Been playing them good all weekend. Struggled through them today, but happy with -- 22-under par is not too bad.  
  
  Q. It's pretty damn good. And I got to ask you about the shot on 17. That was close to going in.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Oh, it was?  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Exactly, it was a good shot. I wish I could have had that shot on 18(laughter.)   
  
  Q. What did you hit on 17?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: 7-iron.  
  
  Q. And then 18 on that approach shot.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: I pulled the tee shot a little bit, but, no, I hit if good so I knew it was a going to cover.   
 It was a pretty tough shot left to right and came out with a 5-iron.   
  
  Q. You got to be real happy. I heard your caddie say this was the best tournament you ever had here.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: It is. It is. So hopefully next year we can do a little better.
