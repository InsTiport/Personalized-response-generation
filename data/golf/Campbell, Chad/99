Q.  I know you're disappointed today but the bottom line, second place finish here at Sony.
CHAD CAMPBELL:  It was a disappointing day.  I really played terrible today.  David played good.  I never put any pressure on him to make him do anything, but he played solid.  65 in the final round, that's pretty good golf.
Q.  It's a funny golf course, one day birdies seem to come easy and the next day, they just don't.
CHAD CAMPBELL:  You're right, you're right.  I didn't know if I was going to make one today or not.  Finally got one on 17.

You know, not a bad start to the year so hopefully I'll be able to get it done the next few weeks.
Q.  Was David just too good today?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  He played real well.  I didn't put any pressure on him.  From the start he birdied 1 and 3, and I didn't really even have any birdie putts, birdie attempts to scare him off at all.  But he played solid and got to give him credit.
Q.  You went 67 67 62, what was the difference on Sunday?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  I just didn't hit the ball well, didn't putt well, didn't do much of anything well.  That's the way it goes sometimes.  Hopefully I can go work on it and do better next week.
