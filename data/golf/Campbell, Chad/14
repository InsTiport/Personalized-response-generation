Q. The North Course is supposed to be the scoring course, you made up for it with a 6-under 66?
CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, I played well.  The fairways over there are probably tighter than the South Course.  So the rough's just as nasty, but you have short irons going in so you can get it on the greens.  So that's what makes it a touch easier.
Q. What's the big change?  Because every player has been playing the North Course saying that rough's gnarly?
CHAD CAMPBELL: It is.  The par-5s are a little bit easier over there, you get a little bit shorter clubs into those, so take advantage of those and hence the score.
Q. A man with your experience and TOUR history, to be three back heading into the weekend, how are you feeling about things?
CHAD CAMPBELL: I feel good.  I feel like I'm playing all right.  Definitely got a few things I need to work on this afternoon to get sharp for tomorrow and come out and see what happens.
Q. Is the most work on the greens, have you been ball striking well?
CHAD CAMPBELL: Struggled a little bit driving it today.  Hit some good ones, but hit a few left and so go try to figure that out.
