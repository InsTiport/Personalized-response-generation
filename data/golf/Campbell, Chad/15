 Q.  How would you assess that round today?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: I feel like I played okay.  The pins were pretty tough.  There wasn't a whole lot of low scores.  It was pretty hard to get to those pins.  But I feel like I played okay, and looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  What are you expecting out of the golf course tomorrow?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, you know, it's kind of weird, if you hit the ball in the fairway you have some chances to make birdie.  If you start hitting it in the rough, it gets really tricky, so you've got to get the ball in the fairway, and hopefully I can have some chances.
