Q.   Talk about the rally back today. 
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Yeah, you know, got off to a good start down on the front nine, then birdied 10 and struggled there for a few holes and was able to birdie the last two holes, so it was a nice way to end the day and get ready for the weekend.

Q.   How is the course playing today?
CHAD CAMPBELL:   You know, it's pretty tough.   The wind is just tricky.   It's hard to tell if it's hurting or helping, and there are a lot of crosswinds.   It's definitely playing pretty tough out there, and it's just such a great golf course, and the wind makes it so hard at times.   That's what makes it great. 

Q.   Talk about your familiarity with this course. 
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Yeah, it's nice.   Obviously played it every year I've been on TOUR, and live in the area and come out here quite a few times during the year and come out and play.   It's just a course that I love, and it's probably my favorite on TOUR and just really enjoy playing it.

Q.   Scores are pretty tight. 
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Yeah, they are.

Q.   Should be pretty interesting. 
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Yeah, it should be.   We'll see what this weekend holds.

Q.   What's it going to take?
CHAD CAMPBELL:   No telling.   No telling.   If you're hitting the ball in the fairway, you can attack the course, but if you start getting in the rough, the lies in the rough are pretty tricky.   You get a lot of fliers out of there, and it's hard to judge.   You get the ball in the fairway, you can shoot a good number.

Q.   You have a pretty good base of fans here in the Dallas area.   Does it feel good to feel like you've got a hometown crowd?
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Oh, absolutely.   I've got a lot of family here, as well, so it's always nice to play at home and sleep in your own bed.   Always excited to come out here and play in this event.
