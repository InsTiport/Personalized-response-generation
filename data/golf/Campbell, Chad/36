  Q. Unfortunate, I know. Just what's going through your head right now?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, just can't believe you make a mistake like that. Obviously disappointed that I'm not getting to play today, but that's the rules. That's the way it goes.  
  
  Q. 83rd on the FedExCup points list. I know that makes it even tougher for you.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, it would have been nice to go out there and play good today and finish up the week pretty good and hopefully get into next week. But that's the way it goes.  
  
  Q. Was there any reason that you didn't do it? Did you get here late or was there anything --  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: No, not really, just kind of slipped my mind.  
  
  Q. When did you arrive this week?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Tuesday, Tuesday night.   
  
  Q. And thoughts now for the rest of the season? What will your plans be?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, not really sure. Probably play Jackson, Jackson and Vegas for sure and then possibly Sea Island.  
  
  Q. Anything remotely ever happen like this?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, a little bit worse. I went to Hawai'i one time and didn't commit. It's starting to be a trend.
