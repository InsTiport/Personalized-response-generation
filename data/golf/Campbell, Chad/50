 Q. Looked like they hit it really well, but you guys were really trying to make a little comeback there on the back nine. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL: We did. We were giving it all we had on the back nine, and unfortunately we didn't get it done, but we fought back pretty hard.

 Q. The best thing about this game is this is only the morning, got the afternoon coming up. Any idea what's going to be the plan for the afternoon?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Not yet. Not yet. We'll wait and see, go root our guys on here, and hopefully they can help us out a little bit. We'll see what happens this afternoon.
