 Q.  6-under par in the rain-delayed first round.  Talk about your 66?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, got off to a good start on the front nine and a little bit slower on the back nine but it was nice to end up there with a birdie.   
 Q.  As you mentioned, you were 5-under on the front, and 1-under on the back, and the back such supposedly is much easier to score out here.  
CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, we had that delay and I drove it right down the middle on 13, and had a perfect number and then the wind kind of died on us.  So I ended up laying up.  But anyway, I'm happy with the round and looking forward to getting out here tomorrow early and see what we can do.   
 Q.  Of course the rains came and there was a bit of a delay, two hours almost.  How much did that affect you?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, not much.  We're kind of used to it.  We deal with it all year long unfortunately, but luckily it didn't rain too much.  The course is in such good shape, I think it will be great for the weekend.   
 Q.  Do you think scoring conditions were a little better, or iffier because you could have picked up a few mud balls along the way?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, they played in a little bit of rain this morning, so I would probably say that they probably had a little -- maybe a touch tougher this morning playing in about 30, 45 minutes of rain.   
 Q.  Glad you got it done?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, glad we got it done.  Glad we were first out.
