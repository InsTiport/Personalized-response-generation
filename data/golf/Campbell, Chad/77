 Q.  Tough match out there.  I mean, you took it all the way to 18 holes. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, it was.  We kind of went back and forth for a while and I was able to make a few putts on the last few holes and hold on the last couple holes. 

 Q.  Any turning points or anything that happened for you that could have really changed the match? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  You know, I guess he was 1-up on -- I can't remember what hole.  He hit it in the bunker on I think it was 13 -- yeah, 13 -- and had to make an eight-footer for par. 
 I think that was kind of a turning point.  Got it back to even and won the next hole. 

 Q.  You've had a lot of success in match play and so has Geoff Ogilvy.  Should be a fun match. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, I guess he's undefeated in this tournament, so should be a good match and looking forward to it.  Hopefully I can come out and make a few birdies.
