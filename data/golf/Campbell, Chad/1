 Q.  Chad, great round, great playing out there today.  It was highlighted by an eagle.  
 Can you talk us through about what it was like out there today?   
CHAD CAMPBELL: It was good.  Got off to a great start on the front-9.  Obviously making one from the fairway always helps.  And I struggled a little bit on the back-9.  It was nice to be able to birdie 17 and make a good par on 18.   
 Q.  How does a round like this raise your confidence for the round and tournaments coming up?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: A lot.  I haven't got to play too much this year.  I feel like I've been playing halfway decent.  Haven't gotten the chances to play.  Definitely a good start to the week.   
 Q.  I know this course is a lot different from the courses you usually play.  How is the links style kind of fitting your style?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: It's a good course.  It's in great shape even after all the rain we got yesterday and definitely different, different for this area, you know, and but I think guys are really liking it.   
 Q.  It feels like they are going low today, scores are getting really low.  What's your mindset heading forward?  
CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, the same.  Conditions, not much wind.  The wind was picking up when we were finishing up our last four, five holes.  No wind out there, it's very getable.
