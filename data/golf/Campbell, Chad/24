 Q.   Chad Campbell, 3‑under 67 for 7‑under.   Tell me about today.   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   You know, I played pretty solid.   Played solid the end of the Back 9 yesterday, and I kind of continued it today, hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens and gave myself a lot of opportunities.   And I was able to make a few and hopefully on the weekend keep doing the same.  
   
 Q.   Did the course change its personality much with the wind and the conditions this morning?  
CHAD CAMPBELL:   It was a little windy out there this morning, and the rain we got just felt pretty soft, the fairways were soft, the greens were pretty soft as well.   
Made it play a little bit longer, some of the holes when you're in the rough and the fairways.  
   
 Q.   And the hole locations to me looked like they were kind of on the edge in a few.   Did it appear frustrating to you?  
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Yeah, they were.   You know, kind of where the grain switches at the top of the hills, and a lot of the pins were that way, so it made it pretty tough reading the greens.  
   
 Q.   You struck the ball fantastically.   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Thanks.   Appreciate it.
