Q. How would you assess your game?
CHAD CAMPBELL: It feels pretty good right now.  I made an 18-footer there.  It was a tough putt, right edge.
And I made a few more on the back nine.  It feels all right now.
Q. 30-under par usually wins this.  You know the guys are going to shoot decent scores every day.
CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, you definitely need to get off to a decent start.  You know if you don't play too well in the first two rounds, it's tough to catch up.  So I'm happy with my start, we'll see what happens in the next couple days.
Q. Can you talk about how you went about this one on 14?
CHAD CAMPBELL: That was a 7-iron in.  I had 170.  And I just hit it a little right of the hole, about eight feet or so.
Q. How do you sort of look at this phase of your career?  What you are your ambitions coming in?
CHAD CAMPBELL: About the same as it's always been, just trying to win golf tournaments.  The older you get, the harder it is and it's never easy out here.  So that's what I'm shooting for and working in that direction.
