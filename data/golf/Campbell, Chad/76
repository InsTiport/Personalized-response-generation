  Q.  Was it Geoff's play or your play?   
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  He played really well, made a lot of key putts.  There on I guess 13 I made a long putt and then he covers me right on top.  So he played really well, I just didn't make enough birdies.   
  
  Q.  What do you think of your experience here?  And also, you have played well in this championship.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  I like it.  Match play is fine.  It's different for us week to week than normal stroke play events, so it's a nice change and I always enjoy it.   
  
  Q.  Did you run out of gas there in the afternoon because of the morning match?   
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  No, not really.  I just wasn't hitting my irons very good.  I was driving it pretty decent, just couldn't hit it close enough with my irons and didn't make any putts.   
  
  Q.  Any key point of when there might have been a change in the match for you?   
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  It's kind of early, but I felt like 7.  I drove it up there about ten feet for eagle and then he kind of drove it down left, had a pretty tough shot and he made birdie and I lipped out my eagle putt.  So I think that was pretty much the turning point.  And then he won the next hole, as well.
