  Q. Your thoughts teeing off in your third Ryder Cup.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, very excited about it. I think me and Stewart will be a good team and seems like we are playing pretty well right now so definitely looking forward to getting out there and getting it going.  
  
  Q. Talking to the other players, the course kind of lends itself to an aggressive style of play; you have to be aggressive?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: I think so. You have to shoot at some pins and try to make some birdies and be aggressive, like you said, some of the rough is cut down and in the places just off the fairway, so you can still be very aggressive from that rough.   
  
  Q. Have you been able to draw on your past Ryder Cup experience?   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, just knowing that earlier in the week not to wear yourself out, kind of pace yourself. It's a long week. Pretty much that more than anything, and you know, definitely when the matches start, be a little bit more comfortable than I have in the past.   
  
  Q. You met Ali today?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: It was great. It was pretty special and definitely an honor for him to come out and watch us hit it off the 10th tee this morning. It was just great to see him out here. He's such an incredible man. It was neat to learn a lot about him, and Monday I knew a lot of his boxing but I didn't know some of the other stuff behind the scenes.
