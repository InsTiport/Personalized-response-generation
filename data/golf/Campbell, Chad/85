Q.
You guys battled really hard, no question about it, you were facing good opponents but you didn't let it get away from you.
CHAD CAMPBELL:  We let a couple holes go there in the middle part of the back nine, but Zach came through pretty huge, hit great shots on the last few holes and made a great putt on 17.
Q.  Take us through your thoughts on that eagle putt there.
CHAD CAMPBELL:  On the last, it was probably 35 feet or so, so just wanted to get it up there.  I knew what it was going to do up until the end.  Left him a little more than I wanted to, but I thought he could handle it.
Q.  And the green on 18?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  Zach hit 3 wood.
Q.  How far was that eagle putt?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  Probably 35, 40 feet.
Q.  Roughly three or four feet?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, maybe a little less, three ish, but he can handle it.
Q.  Do you know what to expect tomorrow?  The butterflies are up for everybody.
CHAD CAMPBELL:  It felt good.  Obviously Zach played great, being his first time.  I know last time, the first day, the first day is tough.  So, you know, he played awesome, and definitely looking forward to tomorrow.
