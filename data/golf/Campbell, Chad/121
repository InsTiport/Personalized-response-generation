CHAD CAMPBELL:  Thanks. 

Q.
This is the first time you've played here, right?  Talk about, a fun week, I'm sure, but it's nice to get that first win out of the way so you're not going home on Wednesday.  

CHAD CAMPBELL:  Definitely.  You want to take one step at a time and get through the first match.  I came out and played well today, hit a lot of fairways and put a lot of pressure on Tim.  He was missing some fairways so he had to scramble a little bit. 

Q.
How is the rough out here? 

CHAD CAMPBELL:  Pretty tough in spots. 

Q.
Still pretty wet, I'm sure.  

CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, it's dried out some in the last few days, but in spots it's pretty nasty.

Q.
Just overall, you're kind of looking to get your season jump started, and it would be nice to do it here.  

CHAD CAMPBELL:  Exactly.  I'm playing really well, probably the best I've played all year, so hopefully this will get my year started.  

Q.
You rolled that one in to win the match, nice to win it on your own instead of having to depend on somebody else?
