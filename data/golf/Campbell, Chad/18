Q. 10-under for the tournament. Got to be happy with where you are right now.
CHAD CAMPBELL: I am. I feel like I'm playing pretty well this week. Looking forward to this weekend. Hopefully I can continue the good play.

Q. What's been going well for you so far?
CHAD CAMPBELL: Little bit of everything. I made some putts out here. Getting the ball in the fairway, giving myself quite a few opportunities. It's been nice.

Q. It was the front-9, your back-9 today, seemed like you found something maybe that --
CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, I actually played pretty solid the whole way. Made a bad bogey on 18. Played pretty solid all day.

Q. You probably haven't seen your pairing tomorrow, could change a little but right now you're scheduled with Davis Love.
CHAD CAMPBELL: That would be great.

Q. A fun pairing.
CHAD CAMPBELL: No, absolutely. Enjoy playing with Davis. Hadn't played with him that much especially here lately but that would be awesome.

Q. Chad, can you tell real quick, I feel like we've been talking to you a lot lately. Can you tell what's been the difference in your game the last couple months?
CHAD CAMPBELL: Feel like it's all kind of somewhat came together, all the hard work I put in over the last couple years, it's been a little bit of a struggle. 
It's nice to see some rewards from all the hard work I've been putting in. Just can't really pinpoint anything, just kind of everything is a little bit better. Doing a few things right so headed in the right direction.

Q. Were you aware of what was going on with Tiger?
CHAD CAMPBELL: Not really. It's exciting to hear the roars. He definitely -- he also brings out all the fans so it's good to see. I was glad to see him play here and I think it's great every week that he plays.

Q. You'll be just in the group behind him.
CHAD CAMPBELL: Okay. Yeah. I don't know how it ended up. Yeah, that's great.
