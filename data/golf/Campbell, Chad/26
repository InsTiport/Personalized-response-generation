 Q.   (Away from mic.)  
CHAD CAMPBELL:   I just talked to Ryan.   We were hoping for good things for some of those guys.   
   
 Q.   How would you characterize today?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   It was tough out there, got off to a bad start, fought back, and struggled here coming in, bogeying the last two, difficult day out there.   
   
 Q.   Playing in the last group, that's always a challenge.   Every golfer wants it, but it's also the worst of conditions, too.   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   I think everybody had the same today, really, playing three split tees, the wind was blowing the whole time I was out here.   
That's not always the case but it definitely is sometimes.   
   
 Q.   I know you were hoping this was a special day, playing with your friend.   It probably wasn't there.   Is there any part of it that you think back on fondly, playing with a neighbor.   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Always enjoy playing with him, unfortunately neither one of us had a very good day, hopefully tomorrow we will.   
   
 Q.   You guys may play together tomorrow right‑‑  
CHAD CAMPBELL:   I don't think so.   I'm not sure‑‑ I think we're one shot apart from each other.  
   
 Q.   (Away from mic.)  
CHAD CAMPBELL:   It's usually hard to straight down wind so it's tough to club at times.   
   
 Q.   What do you usually wind up getting there?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Depends.   If it's into the wind I can hit up to a 5‑iron, if it's down wind you can hit wedge, so it's hard to say.   
   
 Q.   But keeping it underneath the hole, you think?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Sometimes.   Every pin is different.   
   
 Q.   Does the wind come from the tunnel on 13?   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   No, it's always blowing south.   
   
 Q.   Good to see you back up here on the first page.   
CHAD CAMPBELL:   Thanks.
