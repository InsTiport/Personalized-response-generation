  Q.  Regarding his play.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  I didn't play very good.  I had a lot of bad iron shots and bad tee shots.   
 The course is playing pretty tough.   
 No. 1 was really tough.   
 You are always trying to pick up a few birdies coming in.   
 There aren't very many scores.  Played great in the practice round this week.   
 I know I can come out here and shoot a good round.  It's nice to have that in the back of your head.
