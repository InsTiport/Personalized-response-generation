   CHAD CAMPBELL:  I played alright the first part of the round, just making pars.  It was a nice way to finish up. 

 Q.  What is it about your Texas guys, you and Justin and Joe Ogilvie played with you, lives in Texas.  There's something going on? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  I guess it's just a good place to live.  It's a good group out there.  Justin started off well and I think kind of fed off him a little bit.  I think it was 4-under.  He had it going and I figured I needed to start make something birdies. 

 Q.  Clearly your confidence is up.  How important is that to play well? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  It's great.  I felt a lot more relaxed out there today and I was a lot more confident and trust in what I'm doing. 

 Q.  Great playing man. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Thank you.
