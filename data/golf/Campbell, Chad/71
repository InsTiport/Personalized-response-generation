 Q.  Joining us is Chad Campbell.  Even par round today, talk about your day. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, didn't play too well today.  Didn't drive it very good.  And, you know, didn't putt it very well.  I thought even though I didn't play that well, I still had quite a few opportunities to get a little momentum going, and wasn't able to capitalize on any of those. 

 Q.  Your driving, no pressure on the putting because of the amount of good driving today? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Maybe a little bit.  I think today it's kind of weird they kind of fed off each other. 
 I was lucky I got a few of those putts to fall some of those birdie putts.  They were legitimate chances.  And, you know, I think I might have pressed it a little bit, so... 

 Q.  Today one of those days where maybe you don't have it, you get through with an even par round to get yourself in contention? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, definitely.  I made a pretty good par on the 9th.  It was a tough hole, hit the fairway there.  So nice to get a good up-and-down there and finish on a good note. 

 Q.  18, a tough hole.  We've seen eagles and we've seen bogies.  Seems like a tough hole to play? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, it was.  I drove it in the left bunker today, and hit 7-iron in.  So it's a pretty long hole, playing into the wind today.  So it's really tricky pinpoint out there today. 

 Q.  Final thing - talk about going into the weekend with a chance to win? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  You know, definitely happy, you know, trying to play a little bit better. 
 So hopefully I can get a few putts to fall and get a few things going and we'll see what happens. 

 Q.  As always, thanks for your time. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Thanks.
