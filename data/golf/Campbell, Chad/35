  Q. Watched you make a couple of nice putts on 8 and 9.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, I did. Made a few more putts today. Hit it about the same, just got a few putts to fall and that was the difference.  
  
  Q. How were the conditions early this morning? Were they pretty good? I mean with the cloud cover it wasn't nearly as solid, I don't think, as it was the day before.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah. I don't think it was as solid. You know, we had about two or three holes where it was raining pretty good, so that wasn't much fun.   
 But other than that, you know, it's pretty perfect out here.  
  
  Q. Well, you got double digits here, too. Probably going to need more than double digits in 20, plus or more. So you know you got some work ahead of you.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Absolutely. You know it's going to take low numbers out here. Could be 13, 14 before the day is over. So you never know.   
 Just feel like I'm playing well, and look forward to the weekend.  
  
  Q. Couple good hot ones on the weekend and you'll be having some fun, huh?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah. Absolutely. Make a few putts. Keep hitting it close and making putts and I'll see what happens.  
  
  Q. Thanks for your time.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: You got it.
