 Q. Good round today, and not a bad way to finish there, too. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Absolutely. I finished with two birdies, 17 and 18. I played really well, had a little problem there on 8 and 9, but other than that, fought back well on the back nine and definitely pleased with my round.

 Q. Feel good about where you're at right now, just a few back?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, I think Will is 12, 13, somewhere in there. So I figure somewhere around that will be leading after today. I've got a chance. I need to shoot a couple more good rounds.

 Q. What was the biggest difference for you today? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL: You know, I played a lot like yesterday. I actually probably played better yesterday. Just driving it in the fairway, giving myself a lot of chances and putting the ball pretty well.

 Q. Is this the kind of course where you can make up a lot of ground fast?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: You can. You can make a lot of birdies. There's a lot of birdie holes out there, but if you don't get the ball in the fairway you can be in a little bit of a trouble.

 Q. What do you take into the weekend?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Just keep doing the same thing I'm doing, keep giving myself chances and hopefully keep making some putts or hopefully a few more.
