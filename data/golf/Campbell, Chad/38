  Q. 3-under par, 69. Just talk a little bit about the round today, the golf course, how things went.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, you know, I feel like I played pretty well today. Obviously missed a couple putts that could have made.   
 But, you know, happy with the round. Good start. Just got to keep playing well.  
  
  Q. Your first appearance here since I think 2002. Could you just talk about coming back for the first time in a couple years and kind of what your expectations were coming in.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: No, you know, I liked the course when I was here last. Came up here, and, you know, the weather is perfect. Nice to be out of heat a little bit, you know, the heat and humidity that we've been in.   
 They do a great job with the tournament, too. It's a fun event, pretty laid back event. I think they do a great job.  
  
  Q. Just going into tomorrow's round, obviously a good start. Where do you go from here?  
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Just try to do keep doing the same things: get the ball in the fairway and on the green and try to make some putts.   
 It's not an overly difficult course if the wind is not blowing. But the wind starts blowing, you never know. Par is not a bad score when the wind is blowing.   
 So it gets a little tricky when that wind starts. I'm not sure of the forecast, but just keep hitting good shots and hopefully get some putts to fall.
