  Q. 3-under 67 today, going with a 69 yesterday. Real solid today. That birdie at the first, wow, that's a hard hole.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: It is. You know, you're just trying to get it somewhere where you can get it up around the green. It's a tough hole. I was fortunate enough to roll in a long putt for birdie.  
  
  Q. Starting out there on 10. 10's not an easy hole. 11's not an easy hole. Then you have to make the turn and play some 18 and 1. There are some stretches out here where it's really hard not only to not make birdies, but not make a mistake.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, it is. The main thing is kind of obvious, but you have to keep the ball on the fairway. If you can get the ball on the fairway, you have some opportunities. But there are some tough stretches of golf out here.  
  
  Q. Did you play here in '05?   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: No, I didn't.  
  
  Q. I think if you would have the way you drive it and keep the ball in front of you and keep it in play, I think this is one that you would have wanted to play right from the beginning of the year.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, that's what I've heard. A lot of guys told me it was a great golf course and that I'd probably like it.   
 They're right. I think it's a great golf course. It's tough, but it's fair.  
  
  Q. So far so good. Halfway home and a couple more rounds in the 60's. I think you have to be happy with where you're at through two rounds.   
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Yeah, definitely happy. A lot of golf left, but I'm definitely happy with the start.
