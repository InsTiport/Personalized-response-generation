Q.  Talk about your round today, all those birdies in a stretch, great round for you?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  Came out today, played really well on the front nine.  Back nine is a little tougher to make birdies on, the reachable par 5s, but I was able to hit a lot of good shots and get one birdie back there.  Definitely not a position I wanted to end up in, but definitely a good round today.
Q.  It was a great round overall to finish on.  Do you think this is a great confidence booster going into the Ryder Cup?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  It always helps your confidence when you shoot good scores.  I had not been playing all that well so it's nice to get a good round under my belt.
Q.  What were conditions like today?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  It was a little windy, not as windy as it's been.  Pretty much all day I think it's probably about the same as when we started right now.  You know, definitely makes 16, 17, even 18 play really tough especially 17.  I stood on the tee for a couple minutes trying to pick a club there, so it's kind of swirling.
Q.  Do you think this is the type of condition that may make the course play tougher as the day wears on?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  Absolutely.  It should dry things out.  You know, the greens are still pretty soft, so I don't think it will affect them that much.  The greens do maybe seem a little bit quicker today, maybe play a little bit of a roll.
