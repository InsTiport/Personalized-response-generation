 Q. Chad, birdieing the last hole, 4-under, 16 of 18 greens in regulation, tell us about your day?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Played pretty solid. It was a good day out there. You know you get a good score, the greens are a little bit tough with the rain that we have gotten, so you know, it was good to get off to a good start.

 Q. One thing to play a golf course in practice and Pro-Am, another to play it when it counts. How tough is the golf course?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: It's tough. The greens are pretty difficult. If you get on the wrong side it's difficult and you've got to know where to put the ball on the greens.

 Q. How different did the course play after the rains came and you had that delay?
 CHAD CAMPBELL: Definitely played a little bit softer. The greens were a little bit slower, which with all of the slope.
