 Q.  Talk about your round. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Made a couple bogeys on 15 and 16 of just didn't hit very good golf shots.  I had a couple chances on 17 and 18 and not able to make them but definitely looking forward to the weekend. 

 Q.  What do you have to do on the weekend when you're down five strokes now, how are you going to make that back? 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Doing the same thing I've been doing, make a few more putts.  Just a little off today, get it back tomorrow and give myself a lot of opportunities and hopefully make a lot of putts. 

 Q.  Talk about the conditions today.  Early afternoon, the winds were still up, and then they laid down for you. 
 CHAD CAMPBELL:  Yeah, we got pretty fortunate.  We made the turn and got around 12, I think, and then it pretty much totally died. 
 No, we definitely got the better end of the wave this week.  It's pretty nice out here right now, no wind, perfect.
