CHAD CAMPBELL:  Me and Zach have known each other for a long time, we practiced a lot together and played a lot together so we're looking forward to it.

I came out and practiced for 30 or 40 minutes and saw some of the groups come in behind 10 and talked to them for a second and had a little lunch and came back out.

Zach and I played well when we came here practising for the event, so I'm definitely looking forward to it.
