Q.  Great round of 67 wonderful conditions, tell us about the round.
CHAD CAMPBELL:  I played pretty solid today.  Got off to a slow start, making a bunch of par and then got it going, hit a couple iron shots real close and started making some putts.
Q.  With the weather conditions, and everyone said the greens were soft, did it feel like everyone was passing you at that time?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  You have to be patient when you're playing the first round.

I really wasn't hitting that good at first, and then found it in the middle of the round and then got it going.
Q.  You won at the Bob Hope earlier, you put yourself in great position, tell us how you feel about how your game is at this point in the year?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  I feel like I've been playing really good.  I feel like I'm driving it well and putting it pretty well, also.  So I feel good about things right now.
Q.  This being Arnold Palmer's tournament, next year it will be the Arnold Palmer Invitational, does that mean something special to you and the players?
CHAD CAMPBELL:  Absolutely.  I was fortunate enough to win a couple of years back, and to be able to play this tournament is pretty special.
