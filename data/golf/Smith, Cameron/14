Q. 3-up early but they fought back and got a little run on the back nine.
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, we played well. We just didn't really -- we probably didn't putt as good as their guys. Every time they needed to make a putt, they made a putt. Yeah, we couldn't quite get it rolling with the putter.
Q. So at the moment, 9-7, unbelievable fight back by Leish and Abraham, they were 5-down and look like they might get half a point on the 18th. So you might go into the final day with a slight lead.
CAMERON SMITH: That's good. Would have been nice to have a big one obviously, but you know, any lead is a good lead, and yeah, we're all looking forward to playing tomorrow. Hopefully we can get the job done.
Q. How much are you personally looking forward to that? You come into the final day with a chance to one Presidents Cup for just the second time.
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, it would be a good day. I'm sure these guys, you know, they don't have a lot of quit in them, but it will be a tough day but hopefully it's a good day.
