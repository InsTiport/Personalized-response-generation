Q. Could you just give me some quick thoughts on your round today?
CAMERON SMITH:   Not that great.  I didn't put myself in a position off the tee where I could score very well, so yeah, plenty of missed fairways and then just out of position from the tee, and it was just hard to kind of get it around with that.
Q. How did the course play today versus the first two rounds?
CAMERON SMITH:   It's starting to firm up a little bit.  I played yesterday morning -- I mean, yesterday afternoon it looked like it was firming up a little bit, so compared to yesterday morning it was definitely a lot firmer and a little bit faster, as well.  It was nice.
Q. You've been in contention before; what does it take to win?
CAMERON SMITH:   Yeah, I think just fairways.  Just hit the fairway, and half the time you've actually got a pretty short club in because it's playing so fast and you can actually make a pretty decent number.  Yeah, just got to hit it in the fairway off the tee.
