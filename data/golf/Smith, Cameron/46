Q. You just keep rolling on.CAMERON SMITH: Today was an awesome experience.  I felt like there was a few more people out there today, obviously probably being at the back of the field.  But I just kept it in myself and just kept playing.Q. You're going to be in one of the final groups on a Sunday in your first major.  Can you put that into words.  Did you expect this could be a possibility?CAMERON SMITH: No, not really.  It's like a dream come true, really.  That's all I can say.Q. Must be a bit disappointed to break that 70s promise.CAMERON SMITH: No, I'm not.  I'm happy with 1-under.  I played pretty well today.  Got off to a bit of a rusty start, but brought it back on the back nine.Q. With a bit more luck you might have gotten lower.CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I missed a couple of putts on the back nine, the front nine I scrambled pretty well.  I was pretty fortunate to get out of there with 1-over. And then just went back to my game plan and a few putts dropped on the back nine.Q. Is the game plan to keep exactly what you've been doing going again?  But Sunday is going to be another beast again.CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.  The game plan today was adding pars, get out there and play smart and just putt it well.  That's been the game plan all week.  And if I can do that tomorrow, hopefully be in with a shot.Q. Does this remind you of anywhere you've played before?CAMERON SMITH: No, not really.  It's quite different to everywhere else.  But I like it.Q. What about it do you like?CAMERON SMITH: Just the shot making.  You have to hit every shot.  Sometimes it's a bit like you just throw the yardage book out and hit a shot.  I like that kind of golf.  And I think it's a good challenge.
