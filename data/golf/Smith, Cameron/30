Q. Seven birdies today against Tyrrell Hatton, is that due to the conditions are easier or you knew you had to make that many birdies?
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I knew I was coming up against one of the best players in the world today and he proved that.
The conditions were a touch easier, the greens were a little bit softer.  So nice for some good scoring.  But I still played really well, and it's good to get on.
Q. Now you get the awesome task of taking on Alex Noren, what do you think you need to do this afternoon to beat him?
CAMERON SMITH: I know he's been playing well this week.  I heard yesterday that he made one bogey through the three rounds, so that's pretty impressive.  I'm looking forward to the challenge this afternoon.
Q. Just sizzling golf today.  Eight birdies, tell me about it.
CAMERON SMITH: Was it eight or seven?
Q. We had you down for eight.  You had to play great golf to beat Tyrrell Hatton?
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, the conditions were a bit easier, the greens a touch softer.  I knew I had to be aggressive and thankfully the putts went on.
Q. You're on to the round of eight.  Will you get a chance to exhale?  You have Alex Noren who now has a big lead on Patrick Reed.
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I'm looking forward to the chance this afternoon against Alex.  He's been playing great golf.  I'll go and have lunch and try to get a bit of warm up again and head out.
Q. You talk about how tough this is, but it's also fun, isn't it?
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, it's fun playing a bit of a different format.  It's good to mix it up sometimes.  Yeah, it's been good.
