 Q.  Coming through for Ernie Els, doing is this in your home country for the very first time.  
CAMERON SMITH: Very special out there today. Lots of family and friends. Obviously the support for the Internationals this week has been really good. No words, really. It's just been awesome.   
 Q.  It's interesting when you were getting the hugs and handshakes, you were saying "thank you" when they were congratulating you, but it would be better if you guys win. So what's it like having to deal with not only what you are doing but also the surroundings around you?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, it was tough all day. Obviously the TVs around the golf course, you know, scores, watching what's going on, rooting for them guys and then trying to do your job, as well, it's tough work. We need Louis and Marc to come through here to try and tie it up. I know that would put a smile on the Captain's face, I'm sure.   
 Q.  What a finish, to come back 3-down early, turn it around and get a huge point. Must be feeling great?  
CAMERON SMITH: That feels good. No words really to describe the atmosphere, I guess. The fans this week have been awesome. Lots of family and friends here. It's just been a good week. Hopefully we can get these last two points here to try and tie it up.   
 Q.  Huge scalp in match play to get under your belt.  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I guess so. Down early, the Internationals on all the TVs around the golf course, I knew they kind of needed me. It was nice to come through.   
 Q.  Family and friends here, some pretty good celebrations there?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, that's good fun. You don't get stuff like that very often, so just try and enjoy it.
