  Q. 2-down going to the 16th hole, big birdie there.  Your thoughts on coming back and winning this match over Lanto Griffin?
 CAMERON SMITH:   I think that putt on 16 was kind of a make or break.  I think if I miss that Lanto probably makes his and it's all over.  So obviously for that putt to go in and keep the match going was good.
 Q. You go to 17, you get the honors there, and you stick it in tight and that put more pressure on him.
 CAMERON SMITH:   Yeah, I mean, I just had to.  I mean that pin's kind of gettable if you play smart.  So, yeah, it's good to hit a good shot in there.  Good to hit some good shots under pressure early in the week.
 Q. So Ian won earlier today over Rory in this group 11, so you and Ian play tomorrow.  That's a big point now with both of you guys with one point today.
 CAMERON SMITH:   Yeah, I mean, that's probably going to be the match, I guess, for our group.  So, yeah, looking forward to playing Poults tomorrow.
