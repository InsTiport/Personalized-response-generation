Q. Came down to the 18th hole.  You couldn't put him away there.  He battled back.  But a nice win for you?
CAMERON SMITH: He went through a stretch there on the back nine, just kept making some nice putts.  Put a lot of pressure on me.  I was able to hold him out.
Q. It was a good match.  Matches out there right now where guys are throwing up double bogeys and triples.  But you guys both played really well today.
CAMERON SMITH: I don't think I had a bogey today.  I played really well.  Pat played really well.  I just managed to get my way.
Q. Tell us about the golf course, the conditions, how tough or easy is it for you guys?
CAMERON SMITH: It's pretty brutal out there with how firm it is and the wind as well.  I was hitting shots in the wind that were releasing six or seven meters.  It's pretty crazy to see that.
