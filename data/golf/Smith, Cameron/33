 Q. (No Microphone.)  
CAMERON SMITH: The short game's been really good the last couple days and then the putting as well, putting under 10 feet.  
   
 Q. Upped what looks to be difficult scoring conditions, what did you lean on?  
CAMERON SMITH: I thought I made a little bit of progress with the putting and then it was just so tough when we were coming in that back nine, it's getting breezy, so, yeah, needed to scramble well.  
   
 Q. Did you have a look at the leaderboard there a couple of times and see the other guys all going backwards?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I did have a little bit of a look, I think they got a big one on 15, so, yeah, I had a little bit of a look. A little bit surprised, but it's so firm and windy out there, it's very tough.   
   
 Q. After day two you're in contention at the U.S. Masters, how does that make you feel?  
CAMERON SMITH: That's all right. I'm trying not to think about it too much. Yeah, just keep doing what I'm doing heading into the weekend. Just need to hit a few more balls this afternoon, like I said, and get the driver figured out and then I think I'll be good to go.  
   
 Q. Tell us about 17. I thought you would pitch out but you took the trees on. Tell us the thought process there.   
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I either had to chip out and have a probably a 5‑ or a 6‑iron in or try and get it over the trees there and it looked very inviting and my caddie said it was a go, so we just went with it and ended up hitting it on the green, which was a big bonus. Yeah, to get away there with a par was awesome.  
   
 Q. What's your plan for the weekend?  
CAMERON SMITH: Not much, really. Just try and relax as much as I can, try not to think about it, and just, yeah, just head into the weekend with a fresh mind.
