 Q.  Great round today.  7-under to start the tournament.  Can I get some thoughts from you?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, it was really good today.  Hit it well, I got some putts rolling in from the start, which was -- got me on a good momentum booster for the first 12 or 13 holes, which was nice.   
 Q.  If you could, take me through any of your birdies that stood out.  
CAMERON SMITH: I made a long putt on the 4, my fourth hole of the day as well.  So, yeah, just seeing the longer ones go in was nice from the start.   
 Q.  This is your rookie year on TOUR, a great round today.  What does it mean to you after missing the cut last week to get off to a good start here?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, it's nice.  I felt as though my game has been there the last couple weeks, the results haven't been happening.  So it's good to finally get one in the bag.   
 Q.  Do you get frustrated at all with not seeing it happen as fast as maybe you thought you should have starting out?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, a little bit frustrating.  Everyone wants to get off to a nice start to the year, so, but you can think of the positives and leave the negatives behind.   
 Q.  Lastly, playing Pebble tomorrow, your thoughts on that golf course and potentially having another low one there.  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I think the three golf courses here actually suit my game quite a lot.  So, hopefully, I can go out there and hit it the same as today and get the putts rolling in again.   
 Q.  What's the strength of your game?  
CAMERON SMITH: Probably putting and putting and the irons all the way down, I would say.  Distance, definitely no.
