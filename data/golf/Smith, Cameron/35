 Q.  You knew what you had to do to get the match.  Great tee shot.  That was a great wedge up here.  You used the contour of the green to slide it by the right.  Your emotions as you finish this off?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I mean, that's pretty big not having to do a playoff to get into the weekend.  That was kind of on my mind the last four or five holes there.  To bring one back on the last hole was pretty special.   
 Q.  That was a great match yesterday.  You have been involved in some really good matches here this week.  And you're playing some great golf as you head to the weekend?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I feel as though I've had three really tough matches.  All three days I've played really well.  The putter got a little bit cold there towards the end, kept hitting lips, but nothing that can't be fixed with a bit of practice.   
 Q.  What's the confidence level now as you go into the weekend?  
CAMERON SMITH: That's really huge, that putt there, to know that I can get it under the pump.  I'll sure I'll draw on that on the way in.
