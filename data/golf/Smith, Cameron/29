 Q.  Another solid round.  This is four good rounds of golf, and you finish at 13-under.  Your thoughts on how you played this week?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, obviously really solid.  Driver kind of let me down a little bit today but nothing that can't be fixed over the next week.   
 Q.  I know you were trying to chase down Bryson.  When you got the first two birdies, did you look at the board and go, wow, this is going to be tough?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I knew I was going to be in for a bit of a long day trying to chase down Bryson today; he's been playing well.   
Just had to probably play a little more aggressive than I would have liked, but that's what you've got to do to win golf tournaments and I was happy with how I've played.   
 Q.  You're projected now 16th in the FedExCup standings and that's really good heading into the next couple of tournaments, and you can build on that the next couple weeks?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.  16 is pretty good I guess.  Better than where I was.  Obviously really solid this week, and looking forward to next week.
