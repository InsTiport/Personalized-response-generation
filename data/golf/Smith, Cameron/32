Q. Two win, two matches.  How good does it feel?
CAMERON SMITH: It's good.  It was good to knock Pat off yesterday.  It was a hard match.  And then Hideki today.  We kind of scrambled all day today in the wind.  To be able to get it done was pretty cool.
Q. Both days you found something and both were bunker shots that you holed out when the chips were down.  How good does that feel?
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I mean, two miracle shots, really, that have gone in for me.  I thought I had some unlucky bounces today as well.  So that made up for them.
Q. We went ten holes with a result either way.  It was obviously going back and forth.  How do you keep your composure and keep things going when it's such a frustrating battle?
CAMERON SMITH: It got quite frustrating there at the end of the front nine.  I made three bogeys in the row and really shouldn't have.  Wasn't in bad spots.  And that was kind of frustrating.  Pinna just said to me to man up and keep doing what you have been doing in on the back nine.  We did that and it worked out.
Q. It's been a while since you have played match play.  But you were Australian champion.  Do you feel the wheels coming back?
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, it's definitely a different game, match play.  Especially around here.  So many opportunities to make eagles and birdies and the polar opposite as well.  You can make doubles and triples pretty much anywhere.  Really good match play course.  Looking forward to tomorrow.
