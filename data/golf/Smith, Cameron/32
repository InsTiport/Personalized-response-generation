 Q. You played beautifully today, tough finish though.   
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I felt as though I could have got a few more out of it today, missed a few putts and a couple easy wedge shots and stuff like that, but all in all, pretty good day, anything under par around here, any day is good.  
   
 Q. It was a Saturday at Augusta, you're under par and you improved your position, you got to be happy though?  
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I mean, yes and no. I'm happy that I improved my position, absolutely I'm happy that I shot under par, but I feel as though, like I said, I left probably two or three out there today that were pretty easy to turn around.   
   
 Q. Tomorrow what's the game plan?  
CAMERON SMITH: Same again. I think it's going to be a little bit harder tomorrow, probably a little bit more wind. It was quite calm out there today. So just prepare myself for another tough day out here.
