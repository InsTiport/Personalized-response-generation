Q.   It was a fantastic way to finish your week with a bogeyâ€‘free 68. 
CAMERON SMITH:   Yeah, I hit the ball pretty solid all week.   Could have holed a few more putts on the back nine today, but that's the way it goes, so I'm pretty happy with it.   Not much to complain about.

Q.   When you look back at the week, what did you do well to get you this top 5?
CAMERON SMITH:   I think I drove the ball a lot better this week than I have been.   I putted well, as well.   I think if you get it in the rough around here you get pretty penalized, so I managed to keep it out of there, and that's where I scored well, I think.

Q.   Your year keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?
CAMERON SMITH:   Yeah.   You know, beyond expectations for me.   Yeah, I'm pretty happy.

Q.   Some decisions to make, as well, with this exemption to the PGA TOUR next week?
CAMERON SMITH:   Yeah.   I think I'm going to go.   It would be a pretty hard offer to turn down. 

Q.   Looking back at your career 10 months ago when you came to qualifying school and where you are now, can you sum it all up in a few sentences? 
CAMERON SMITH:   No, not really.   I can't.   I don't even know what to say.   Completely speechless. 

Q.   All the top 10s that you've had in quick succession, has it been down to the work that you've done during your amateur days?   What's been the reason? 
CAMERON SMITH:   I think just my attitude.   My attitude this year has been a lot better towards working and working on my game. 

Q.   This gets you up on the Asian Tour Order of Merit, as well, maybe giving yourself to challenge David and Anirban for No.1.   Is that something in the back of your mind?
CAMERON SMITH:   I'm not really sure.   I'm going to have to see how the rest of the year turns out.
