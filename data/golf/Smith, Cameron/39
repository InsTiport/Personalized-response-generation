Q. The wind has given some people some trouble.
CAMERON SMITH: I don't know, really.  Everything I hit, whether it was sort of a rubbish shot or a good shot kind of went close to the hole.  My short game was really good today.  I think I had three chip-ins today.
Q. How important is the driving accuracy here at TPC San Antonio?
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah.  You can't miss the fairway here.  Basically all you have to do is just keep it between the trees and you're going to be all right.  I managed to do that the first couple days and it was good.
Q. How does this course set-up for you with the trouble with the bushes, not as many trees but that wind will be up over the next couple of days?
CAMERON SMITH: I've been driving the ball really good the last three, four weeks and I haven't really got as much out of it.  Kind of nice to come to a course like this where it demands good drives and good short game.
Q. Did you make any adjustments coming into this week at all?
CAMERON SMITH: No.  I switched between putters.  I switched yearly this week.
Q. Cameron, 6 birdies and an eagle.  I didn't think you could find that out there.  Good for you, mate.  Tell me about the round.
CAMERON SMITH: To be honest, just struck it well.  My short game is great.  I think I had three chip-ins.  That was kind of nice.  Other than that, it was just all kind of falling into place.
Q. You were 6 for 6 scrambling in the 2nd Round, 8 of 10 for the week.  Really the round is made by your finish.  Eagle at 8 and then putt from the fringe at 9.
Tell me about it.
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I had kind of a tough shot, 20, 30 yards needed to get it on the top deck.  That's all I was trying to do, give myself a putt and it went in.  Bit of a bonus.
Q. 21 footer from the fringe at the 9th to finish off.
CAMERON SMITH: It was a pretty simple putt, straight down the hill.  Not much to it.  Nice little one.
Q. Well, with the wind, like I said, the course had to be very challenging.  How you were you handling the breezes?
CAMERON SMITH: I'm from Australia.  We grow up in this kind of stuff.  It's kind of cool to be able to come and have such tough driving holes as well
