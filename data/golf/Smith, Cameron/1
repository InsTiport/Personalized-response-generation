Q. Was it a little bit of a griped out there for you today?
CAMERON SMITH:   On the putting greens it was.  I hit it the best I hit it all week and just couldn't hole a thing.  It was really tough work.
Q. You said yesterday, speed might be a little off.
CAMERON SMITH:   I felt like I hit a lot of good putt today.  I mean, I'm putting it down to miss-reading.  But it might just be one of those weeks on the greens where I can't hole anything.
Q. What's your mentality as you head out there tomorrow?
CAMERON SMITH:   Just got to be aggressive.  Got to go out there and shoot a really low number.  I think the leaders are at 16-under, maybe a few more before we're done today.  It's going to be a really hot start and like a round of my career, I guess you could say, to have a chance.
Q. Beating Brendan Steele in the playoff last year, and he's playing well again this week --
CAMERON SMITH:   I mean, he's a really good mate, as well.  It's good to see him playing well.  It's always good to see your mates playing well.
