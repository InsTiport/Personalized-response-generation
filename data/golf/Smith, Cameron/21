Q. 2-under the last seven or eight holes must be pretty satisfying?
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, that was good.  That's probably where my game should be.  I left a couple out there.  Even had a few putts that went out on the edge.  Everything was pretty solid.  No complaints, really.
Q. You said you felt like you found something when you were in Detroit.  Is that what helped you out today?
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, I guess probably just a little bit of confidence back in the game.  Just knowing that I can stand over a shot and not have any bad thoughts going through my head, just a bit clearer mind and just going ahead and committing to a shot rather than committing to a swing thought or something like that.
So, yeah, it feels quite nice.
Q. I don't know if you've seen the leaderboards, but the weather out there, was it tough?  There are some big numbers out there.
CAMERON SMITH: Yeah, it seemed like one second it was hot and calm and the next second it was cold and windy and rainy.  Yeah, we had a bit of everything today.  I can see how it could have happened.  But we got through it.
Q. What's the approach tomorrow?
CAMERON SMITH: Much the same, really.  I didn't really think there was anything wrong with the game plan.  I'm just struggling with the driver this week and then going straight into a 2-iron, so it's kind of forcing me on a few holes to push it down there a little bit.
But again, it feels good.  I just feel comfortable.
Q. When you get on a round like you did today, does it at some point make you want to give it a straight go?
CAMERON SMITH: I was trying to make birdie.  It was nice, I made a couple of good saves through the middle there to kind of keep the momentum going.  I felt I had enough in the bag to make birdies.  But I didn't drop some.
