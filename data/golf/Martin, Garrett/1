 Q.  Going on to the quarterfinals.  Tell me a little bit how you're feeling right now.  
GARRETT MARTIN: I'm proud.  I'm excited.  Nervous.  A lot of adrenaline running through me right now.  Came down to the wire this morning going into the last hole 1-up.  Was able to seal that deal.   
And then today, this afternoon, loosing 17 and then going into 18 1-up against a great player.  Canon played great.   
Just was a lot of fun.  It's exciting.   
 Q.  That eagle on nine, did you hole-out?  
GARRETT MARTIN: No.  I think he actually conceded the hole.   
 Q.  I see.  Yeah, so you were down one and then won three holes in a row.  Was that kind of a turning point for you?  
GARRETT MARTIN: Yeah, had some momentum going after that.  Hit a little rain delay which kind of - I wouldn't say set me back - but kind of cooled down emotions for both of us.   
Was able to go back out there.  Still had the same mindset and mentality to go win and ended up working out.   
 Q.  2016 you played this for the first time.  Now you're back here in the quarterfinals.  Do you think that experience helped?  
GARRETT MARTIN: Definitely did.  Definitely a little different style golf course, but same kind of tough, long, USGA kind of playing.  So definitely playing in that kind of helped prepare me to know what to expect coming into this week.
