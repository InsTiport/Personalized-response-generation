MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you, nice round today, 4-under par.   
 HEE-WON HAN: Thank you.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: You're tied for the lead right now. If you works just talk a little about how you played today.   
 HEE-WON HAN: Today was actually pretty nice out there. And then my chipping and putting is pretty good out there.   
 Yeah, I'm just happy about my result.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Can you talk a little bit about your year this year?   
 HEE-WON HAN: This is my first year that my baby was born. Yeah, so far, it's pretty good. It's like two tournaments -- this tournament and ADT and I just play for a strong finish the next few weeks.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us a little bit about how the game of golf has grown in Korea? Of course, Se Ri started it, and your generation of players are now on Tour. Are there many girls playing the game in Korea right now?  
 HEE-WON HAN: Yeah, in Korea right now, before they have not much tournaments but right now they have got like almost 25, 30 tournaments right now, and some good players, some young players.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us a little bit about how the game has developed? Do you have public courses or just private? How do the girls get into golf?   
 HEE-WON HAN: When I was younger, they had like national team, Korean, like when we played tournaments and going to like national team and play. But lots of golf courses, it's out of town, that's why they just practice there.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about being a mom right now? Can you tell us about the experience of having your child and how do you feel?   
 HEE-WON HAN: Yes, he's still in Korea. That's why -- my husband's mom and dad take care of my baby this year. That's why it's a little easier than the other moms. It's pretty good.   
  
  Q. Five or six players are tied in first place right now; what is going to be the key for tomorrow to separate from these players and lead alone in the final round?   
 HEE-WON HAN: I think there's a couple players that finished at four, but a couple of players are still playing. That's why I think it's going to be a little bit lower than 4-under, the lead is going to be.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you.
