  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Hee‑Won Han into the interview room.   Take me through your round today.   
HEE‑WON HAN:   It was pretty good.   I mean, a lot of back and forth.   The four birdies, no bogeys, that's why I'm happy to be here.   
THE MODERATOR:   I know you travel with your son Dale typically.   He is not here with you this week.   How is it to have him out of the road with you?   
HEE‑WON HAN:   I was just with him last year, but not this year.   It's pretty tough, but it's pretty good to be with the son.   
Yeah, unfortunately not this year.   
THE MODERATOR:   How does it feel to be in contention heading into the weekend?   
HEE‑WON HAN:   Hopefully weather's getting good for next two days.   This golf course has lots of opportunities for birdies.   Just keep playing good and make lots of birdies.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You have the Olympics coming up in 2016, and golf is going to be included in that.   What does it mean for the sport of golf and for you personally to have the opportunity for golfers to win a medal?   
HEE‑WON HAN:   I mean, that's big thing.   That's kind of like different countries playing.   That's why we have lots of chance to get a gold medal for Korea.   Lots of young girls playing pretty good.   That's why I'm happy to be watching 2016.   
   
 Q.   What was the biggest difference playing the course today versus yesterday?   Something different about the course or your game today?   
HEE‑WON HAN:   No, it's pretty same situation for yesterday and today.   But it's raining, lot of windy this afternoon maybe.   
Yeah, but it's pretty same yesterday.   We play afternoon little rain.   Kind of same situation, yeah.  
   
 Q.   What were your strengths today?   
HEE‑WON HAN:   Not much difference, yeah.  
THE MODERATOR:   Anything that stood out today?   Do you know how many putts and greens you hit, fairways?   
HEE‑WON HAN:   I can count it, but pretty good.   I just missed couple greens.   Make one putt for par.   The four birdies, that's why pretty good today.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   
HEE‑WON HAN:   Thank you.
