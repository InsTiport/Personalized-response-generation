 Q.   I know you thought you were going to miss the cut?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   And then that all kind of changed?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   How cool was that?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   It was pretty cool.   I just really‑‑ I mean it's great to play for all of them.  
   
 Q.   Is it nice to go out making the cut and being able to have two more rounds with your friends?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   No, it's just pretty same, but it's kind of like last tournament that's why I really want to make four days.   So it's pretty cool.  
   
 Q.   Was that kind of a roller coaster thinking you had just missed the cut by one shot and then all of a sudden you're in?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   Yeah, but it was great.  
   
 Q.   How cool was it to see all the support coming off the green?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   I mean it was really nice.   Just Tom coming up, I mean I just win like 2004 here.   Yeah, I like this golf course.   I have great memories here.   
Lots of Korean girls come out.   It was great.  
   
 Q.   Are you pretty content with the decision to retire?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   Yeah.   Yeah.   Time to.   Time to retire.  
   
 Q.   And is it pretty cool having JJ make the cut this week as well with you?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   Yeah.   Everyone, like we all like traveling together.   We had a pretty good night on Friday night, dinner with Juli and Pat and everyone and the caddies came out.   It was a great time.  
   
 Q.   How much will you say in contact with everyone on tour after?  
HEE‑WON HAN:   Actually, I don't have Facebook.   I'm going to make one.
