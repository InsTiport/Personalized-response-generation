Q.  Welcome, Hee-Won, very good round today, still in the lead.
HEE-WON HAN: Thank you.

Q.  6-under par now.  Do you want to talk about how today's round was?
HEE-WON HAN:  It's pretty good, it's pretty similar to yesterday.  I play good driver today and pretty good iron shots today, and then greens are pretty faster than yesterday.

Q.  Greens are faster?
HEE-WON HAN:  Yep. 

Q.  Do you want to talk a little bit about how you felt starting the day, before the day started?  Were you feeling confident?
HEE-WON HAN: Yeah, pretty comfortable, good.

Q.  Questions?  And then I will do the score card.  On the fourth hole, your second shot, what did you use there?
HEE-WON HAN:  Fourth hole? 
THE CADDY:  The actual fourth or our fourth? 

Q.  No, your fourth.
HEE-WON HAN:  Oh, our fourth hole.

Q.  Number 13.
THE CADDY:   Okay.  That was a 7-wood. 
HEE-WON HAN: Yeah, 7-wood. 

MODERATOR: We will go ahead and do the score card, then. 
(Score card.)  

MODERATOR:  More questions?
Q.  The shot on 17 from the tee, did you think it was going into the hole.
HEE-WON HAN:  Not really, just  -- I thought just close.

Q.  Was it above the hole with some spin or did it just  --
THE CADDY:  Just pitched a little below the flag, left and it obviously fades to the right.  I don't know.  We can't see the bottom of the pin so we don't know how close it went.  I mean, obviously just fell short and  --

Q.  How were the course conditions today?  Was it a little drier?
HEE-WON HAN:  Yeah, it was better, getting better.

Q.  Hee-Won, can you talk about the influence Se  Ri has had on the girls in Korea?
HEE-WON HAN:  That's huge.
THE INTERPRETER:  Huge impact. 

Q.  Do the girls there idolize her similar to the way American male golfers idolize Tiger?  Is it comparable?
HEE-WON HAN:  Yeah, like that, yep.

Q.  Can you elaborate on that at all, talk about the impact she has had on your career? 
THE INTERPRETER:  Se Ri Pak is from Korea and she is in her same generation so she is thinking she can do it, why not?

Q.  If not for Se Ri, would she  -- what would she be doing, would she still be a professional golfer at this level without Se Ri's  --
HEE-WON HAN:  Yeah. 
THE INTERPRETER:  She said yes, and she started playing golf at the age of eight, so  -- and she made her mind to be a professional golfer at the age of 13, so I think she pretty much expect herself to be here, I mean, American tour.

Q.  With or without Se Ri? 
THE INTERPRETER:  Right.  That's what she means. 

Q.  Who taught her how to golf (inaudible) ?
THE INTERPRETER:  You mean the beginning or  --

Q.  When she was eight, when she started golfing when she was eight. 
THE INTERPRETER:  Her father. 

Q.  You are going to start tomorrow with a chance to win a major.  Do you think you will be nervous or do you feel you have the experience to handle it okay? 
THE INTERPRETER:  She says she has a lot of experience in LPGA Tour, including Korea and Japan tour, so as of now, she doesn't think she is going to be nervous tomorrow. 

Q.  When is the last time she led going into Saturday?
HEE-WON HAN:  In Phoenix this year. 

Q.  Hee-Won, is it your dream to become Se Ri, to do in America what Se Ri has done, become a superstar? 
THE INTERPRETER:  She doesn't want to be a superstar, but she wants to play her own game, and she tried her best to satisfy herself with her game, ball striking, and that's pretty much about it. 

Q.  Why doesn't she want to be a superstar? 
THE INTERPRETER:  It's going to be pretty tough, she would be tired, busy. 

MODERATOR: Any other questions?  All right.  Thank you.
