 MODERATOR:  Welcome, Hee-Won Hon.  You are tied in the lead with Meg Mallon at 11 under par, birdie finish.  Can you tell us about the round today.
HEE-WON HAN: It was a little windy today, but my putting was good and my shots were fine.  It's okay. 
MODERATOR:  Questions? 
Q.  When you prepare for a final round, what's your mind-set like going into that final round?
HEE-WON HAN: I focus on my game and think of my swing and my putt.

Q.  Did you know you had lost the lead with Meg birdied the last hole to go to 11-under?
HEE-WON HAN: I did know that, but I hit the second shot, and then they have the scoreboard which said 11 under before my putt. 

Q. How far was your first putt on 18?
HEE-WON HAN: 40-foot maybe, a little off the green.

Q.  Hee-Won Hon, I see you won 48 times in your amateur career.  Do you think it's harder to win out here than it was as an amateur?  Did you have a false sense of security that you may be able to win out here when you first came out?
HEE-WON HAN: It's different.  The experience is good for me. 

Q.  How old were you when you started to play in tournaments?
HEE-WON HAN: 11 years old. I played in Korea and Japan and a couple of American tournaments.

Q.  Do you think your putter was the most significant part of your day?
HEE-WON HAN (translated by Manager SAINT KIM): She made a couple well putts today, so she feels good about that.  She sometime missed short putts where she could have made one.  She thinks putting is really important in the game.  She feels today really confident and good about her putting game.

Q.  Did you think about last year today at any time, or is it just when we bring it up?
HEE-WON HAN: I don't think about last year really. 

Q.  Can you talk about how you feel about playing Meg tomorrow?
HEE-WON HAN: I've played Meg a couple times and I like her.  I'll just focus on my game and try to do my best.
(Score card done. )
