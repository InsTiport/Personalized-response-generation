JOEL LAMP:  We'll take questions.
Q.  (Last time in Corning.)
HEE WON HAN:  Four years.
Q.  (Why she came back.)
HEE WON HAN:  Actually, LPGA rules is once every four years.  That is why I came back here.
Q.  Did the conditions lend to your game?
HEE WON HAN:  The course is pretty good.  The greens are good.
Q.  (Keys to early success on Tour.)
HEE WON HAN:  Because every player wants to play LPGA and then I play LPGA Tour and I just wanted more.  Every year I'm more improved in my game.  That's why I practice hard now.  I think every player is doing that.
Q.  What's better now in your game?
HEE WON HAN:  I just keep practicing every year.  My irons are pretty good.  I'm working on my short game.  Today was pretty good.  Putting is pretty good.
Q.  Do you still live in Seoul?
HEE WON HAN:  No.
Q.  (Adjusting to living and working in the United States.)
HEE WON HAN:  That's a pretty hard thing.  English.  Actually, before, when I came in fifth, I played in Japan Tour for four and a half years.  That was pretty good experience for me.  So there's more Korean players right now.  That's why.  I played in Korea, and there are more that came to the LPGA Tour.
Q.  (No microphone.)
HEE WON HAN:  Yep, because of my low score today.
Q.  (No microphone.)
HEE WON HAN:  I don't know.  I just played four years once and then nothing different.
Q.  (No microphone.)
HEE WON HAN:  Pretty good.  It was always good.  If I just play like today, tomorrow, I'll have a good game tomorrow.
Q.  You started today 7 strokes behind the leader.  Did you make a conscious decision to play more aggressively because you were so far behind?
HEE WON HAN:  No, I just kept thinking of my swing rhythm and just focused on my game.  The first day I shot 2 over and then yesterday 3 under.  That's just why I wanted more under par today.
Q.  Where were you when they suspended play yesterday?  What hole were you on?
HEE WON HAN:  One and a half left yesterday.  Yesterday I had one and a half left and 3 hours.  Today it was seven tee.
Q.  (Playing with Annika Sorenstam on Sunday.)
HEE WON HAN:  I just kept playing and then I just kept thinking of my swing, and just my way.
