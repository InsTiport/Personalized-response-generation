Q.  Thanks for coming in.  You're eight under right now.  You're winning here this year and you won last year.

Was the course still wet outside?
HEE WON HON:  It was a little bit wet, but pretty good.
Q.  Even par today, up 2, I think that's a one shot lead right now.  Talk about tomorrow, 18 holes to go.
HEE WON HON:  I didn't change my shot.  I missed the two birdie putts today.  I think tomorrow is coming in.
Q.  Are you and Mi Hyun good friends?
HEE WON HON: Yes.
Q.  Would you say she's your closest friend?
HEE WON HON: She's one or two years older than me, but we're good friends, yeah.
Q.  Did the wind make the first 9 holes you played today, the back side of the golf course, play a lot differently than the first two days?
HEE WON HON: It's pretty windy.  That's why I played longer, and it's still a little wet.
Q.  The others seemed to have quite a bit of trouble with bogeys on that first 9 holes.  I wondered how you were able to play so well through that stretch of holes while they were having so much trouble?
HEE WON HON:  My second shot was not good.  That's why I made par.
Q.  You didn't put your second shots close?
HEE WON HON: Right.
Q.  Your putt at 13, can you talk about that?
HEE WON HON:  It was pretty uphill, so I hit it pretty strong.
Q.  Does it make it harder for you if you are playing with a friend of yours rather than somebody you don't know or don't know well?
HEE WON HON: It doesn't matter, because there is a lot of Korean players here.  We play together a lot.
Q.  The long putts that you made that you putted out, was that a 3 putt for Suzann?
HEE WON HON: Yeah.
Q.  How short was she on her first putt?
HEE WON HON: (Inaudible.)
Q.  Can we go over your scorecard.

(Scorecard done.)
