Q.  Did 17 kind of open the door for you, give you an opportunity? 
HEE-WON HAN:  (Through interpreter)  The fact that Mi Hyun would make a big mistake on 17, after Mi Hyun put the ball in the water, she got excited a little bit.  She was still three stroke ahead.  She got excited, but she still was a little anxious to make another birdie at the next hole. 

Q.  The same question on 18, when Kim put a ball up against the gallery and had to take a drop, how did you feel about that particular shot, as well? 
HEE-WON HAN: (Through interpreter)  At the moment, Mi Hyun was far off the green.  But after Mi Hyun put the chip shot close to the pin, she little knew that Mi Hyun would win. 

Q.  What is your next tournament? 
HEE-WON HAN:  (Through interpreter) Canadian Open.  She going to skip the British Open next week and the following week go to Canada for the Canadian Open.

Q.  How do you feel two weeks in a row being runner-up and so close?  Is it disappointing or are you thrilled because you're getting so close? 
HEE-WON HAN:  I try to make win.  It's more like close, I think. 

Q.  Did you enjoy playing with Mi Hyun, with a fellow country person, somebody from Korea?
HEE-WON HAN:  Yeah, it's good, yeah. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 
HEE-WON HAN:  We're talking Korean language. 

Q.  Was it more disappointing last week because you had a putt to win in regulation?  Today you didn't really have a putt to win it. 
HEE-WON HAN:  Is just different last week and this week. 
(Through interpreter) She felt different.  She wouldn't say how different it is, but she feel difference from last week to this week because, like you said, she was going to miss one putt, finish second.  This week was so far ahead from the first place, to finish second is a little different.  She felt a lot closer last week to the win. 

Q.  How do you rate the difficulty of this course when compared to other courses that you played on the LPGA Tour? 
HEE-WON HAN:  (Through interpreter) Contours are a little more difficult to other tournament sites, and the weather play a lot in this game because it's hot.  Yesterday she said was hottest in the year.  The fairways was hard, too, but not different from other tournament sites. 

Q.  I'm sure you have played with Mi Hyun quite a bit.  Was it a surprise or maybe even a shock when she had the three-shot lead and she hits it in the water?  Were you shocked she would make a mistake like that? 
HEE-WON HAN:  Not really. 

Q.  Why not? 
HEE-WON HAN:  Three-stroke difference with Mi Hyun 10-under, me 7-under.  Mi Hyun make double, just one hole. 

Q.  Were you surprised?
HEE-WON HAN:  Not really.

Q.  (Inaudible)? 
HEE-WON HAN:  (Through interpreter)  On 17, there was only one hole left.  If Mi Hyun put the ball in the water, still make a double, you know, even to tie with Hee-Won or triple bogey for Hee-Won to win this tournament.  About the mistake from Mi Hyun, she didn't really go for that.  She want a fair game.  She played well.  Hee-Won played well.  She want to have fair game.  She want to win out of fair game, not somebody mistake. 

Q.  Did it help your game playing with another Korean?  Were you loose and relaxed because you could communicate?  Second week in a row that's happened.  Just more comfortable?
HEE-WON HAN:  (Through interpreter) She say doesn't matter if she play with other Korean players or American or any other European players.  Doesn't matter, she says. 

Q.  Are you just gradually and constantly getting better or have you made any changes in your game maybe within the last couple months that has produced these back-to-back finishes like this? 
HEE-WON HAN:  (Through interpreter) In her game, she didn't change much actually not really.  Emotionally she was telling herself, you know, play more comfortable with her game.  She tried that.  I think it worked out better that way.  And help from the putting with a better mindset. 

Q.  She is more comfortable? 
HEE-WON HAN:  (Through interpreter) She is more comfortable.

Q.  Why? 
HEE-WON HAN:  (Through interpreter) Confidence.  She is telling herself more comfortable with the mind, try to make better scores, better birdies.  She want to play well.  It helped on the putting.  Probably help improve the scores.
