Q.   Who gave you the flowers walking off the green?
HEE WON HAN:   The media lady.   Who's that.

Q.   Mindy O'Reilly? 
HEE WON HAN:   Yeah. 

Q.   Is this a sad day for you?
HEE WON HAN:   Not really until this green.   But yeah, they make me cry.

Q.   So why decide to retire?
HEE WON HAN:   Actually I just think about the last year, and my kids growing up.   And then thought it was perfect timing for retire.

Q.   JJ said you two had talked about retiring at the same time.   Is that pretty cool to go out together?
HEE WON HAN:   Yeah, because she's playing like 15 years, and then I play like 14 years here. 
It's really that's great memory for my life.

Q.   Is it cool to see how many Korean girls are out here now?   Y'all are kind of the first generation and kind of spurred that growth. 
HEE WON HAN:   Yeah.   It's an honor to be here. 

Q.   Why do you think the emotions hit you on 18 there?   Is it bitterâ€‘sweet walking away?
HEE WON HAN:   Really.   But I'm pretty sad I missed the cut by one.   Yeah.   That's why I cry.

Q.   What's kind of the next phase?   What will be your second career?
HEE WON HAN:   I'm just back to normal life, with my son, spend time with more.   Be a mom.

Q.   Okay.   Where will you live?
HEE WON HAN:   I think I've live in San Diego a couple of years and then I don't know yet after that.

Q.   What does your husband do now?
HEE WON HAN:   Baseball commentator in Korea.

Q.   Oh, okay.   So is he still back in Korea or is he here?
HEE WON HAN:   Yeah.   It's kind of back and forth.

Q.   What will be your fondest kind of memory walking away as you leave the tour?
HEE WON HAN:   All my friends here, and I have winning this tournament especially.   Yeah.   It's great memories.

Q.   Why this week?
HEE WON HAN:   You know what, just kind of keep thinking about retirement, but we have like two weeks off and then Prattville coming up back and forth.   That's why, I mean, this is the one.

Q.   What do you want to be remembered for walking away as you leave?
HEE WON HAN:   Not much.   Not much.   Just play golf today, yesterday and then that's it.   That's why.

Q.   Was that neat seeing how much it mattered to them as well, how much it mattered to Pat and Christina seeing you walk away?
HEE WON HAN:   No.   I'm glad playing with Pat and Christina last two rounds.   And then yeah, it's okay.   Pretty great.

Q.   What is kind of the saddest part about walking away?   Will you miss the game or is it just the friendships out here?
HEE WON HAN:   I don't know.

Q.   You don't know yet?
HEE WON HAN:   Yeah.
