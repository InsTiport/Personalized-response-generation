   HEE-WON HAN: Today just a couple missed shots on first couple holes and then I made a par. Putter is pretty good. 

 Q. So what did you think on Monday and Tuesday?
 HEE-WON HAN: A couple holes pretty tough but pretty good weather in two days, a little bit of wind. 

 Q. How does it feel playing close to home? 
 HEE-WON HAN: Actually lots of people following and pressure to play.

 Q. Playing with Se Ri --
 HEE-WON HAN: Yeah, that's good we're together and we're like good friends.

 Q. Do the fans tell you anything while you're walking down the fairways? 
 HEE-WON HAN: Yeah, it's great.
