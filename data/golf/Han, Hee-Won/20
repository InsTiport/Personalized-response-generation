MODERATOR: Congratulations, Hee-Won Han.
HEE-WON HAN: Thank you.
MODERATOR:  Very nice.  It was your first win.  You want to tell us how it feels.
HEE-WON HAN: I'm so happy.  It feels good. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
HEE-WON HAN: Yeah, 16, par 3.

Q.  Coming up the last four holes, which Meg birdied yesterday, did you think about her birdies and how she might finish like that today?
HEE-WON HAN: No, not today. 

Q.  Can you describe your feeling once you knocked in that 4-footer on 18, can you tell me what was going through your mind at that time?
HEE-WON HAN: If I miss that but still win, it was a nice feeling.

Q.  The great chip you hit, what did you use on the chip, what club?
HEE-WON HAN: A wedge.

Q.  I know we've asked you every day, but did you think at all of last year on the 18th hole?  Did you ever think about last year and about what happened?
HEE-WON HAN: Last year I make 16, par 3.  I just focused on the last three holes with no bogeys.  I didn't make no bogeys.

Q.  Were you satisfied with how you played today?
HEE-WON HAN (through translator SAINT KIM): She said she was. 

Q. When you threw your ball into the crowd, were you throwing it at someone in particular or did you just throw it anywhere?
HEE-WON HAN: Yes, just throw it to the crowd.

Q.  Do you feel that by winning now, you sort of establish yourself as a player to be reckoned with now on the tour; that when you show up, people are going to say, this is a winner, she's somebody we have to watch out for every week when we play?
HEE-WON HAN (through KIM): Yeah, it's true.  She won her first tournament at this event, and even after this event, she's going to try to focus her golf swing and golf game, so that's not going to bother her game.

Q.  Yes, but will she now be the one to beat since she's now won a tournament?
HEE-WON HAN (through KIM): If she get more attention after this event, she's going to try to show them better performance of her golf game.  She'll be happy to do that.

Q.  After the double on 8 and bogeys at 12, 13, I think, how did you not get too upset?  How did you come back and stay focused?
HEE-WON HAN: I had two bogeys, 12, 13  -- 13, 14, but I had just four more holes and two par 5s.  That's why I just tried to make birdies.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
HEE-WON HAN: Yeah. 
(Score card done.)

Q.  What will be the reactions to you winning in Korea?  Is this going to be big news there; something that finally you've won your first tournament?  What do you expect people back home to say?
HEE-WON HAN: In Korea?  They are so happy, but  -- because I'm Korean and a Korean won, they will be happy.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.
