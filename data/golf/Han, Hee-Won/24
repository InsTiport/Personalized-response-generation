CADDIE- Shaun Clews
INTERPRETER- Saint Kim
Q.  Very nice round out there, six birdies, two bogeys.  The course is playing really tough.
HEE-WON HAN:  Yeah.

Q.  Can you talk about how you played today.
HEE-WON HAN:  Today I played really good shots, and then I made a lot of birdie putts. 

Q.  How was the course?
HEE-WON HAN:  Pretty hard, but green stops pretty good.

Q. When is the first time you remember maybe ever watching this tournament or  --
HEE-WON HAN:  This tournament? 

Q.  This is your third time playing here.  Did you know much about it before you came to play here?
HEE-WON HAN:  Yeah.  This is my third time, this course.

Q.  What did you do well today?  What were you  -- you know, driving the ball, putting, what did you do well today?
HEE-WON HAN:  My wood shots were pretty good, and then putting is pretty good. 

Q.  You must have hit a lot of fairways.  How many fairways did you hit, and greens?  It's probably easier, how many fairways did you miss?
CLEWS (CADDIE): Fourteen greens.

Q.  And how many fairways?
CLEWS (CADDIE): Actually, we only hit seven out of  --

Q.  Seven fairways?
CLEWS (CADDIE): Which is  -- which is actually more than she usually misses.

Q.  Only hit seven fairways?
CLEWS (CADDIE): Yeah.  But a couple of them were just  --

Q.  Just on the fringe?
CLEWS (CADDIE): Right, which is not too bad.  But then we had a couple of shots, obviously, out of the sort of deepish rough, made one nice up and down and made one bogey from it, but she drove it well.  She did drive it pretty good.  Better than it sounds. 

Q.  When Se Ri Pak won here in 1998, were you  -- did you know about it?  Were you watching it on television?
HEE-WON HAN: Yes.

Q.  What did it mean to you?  How did you feel about it?
KIM (INTERPRETER):  At that time, when I was maybe in Japan tour, and then I was very happy to win the tournament by Se Ri Pak, and she is Korean, and they played in the same team, I mean, Korean National Team, for about one year.
HEE-WON HAN: Three, four years maybe.
KIM (INTERPRETER): Three to four years in the same Korean National Team, so they were just like sisters, so pretty happy. 

Q.  Can you talk about what it feels like to be up there at the top of the leader board after a first round?
HEE-WON HAN:  Pretty good.  Happy. 

Q.  Have you been in this position before?
HEE-WON HAN:  No, not first day.

Q.  Did Se Ri doing what she did over here make you feel like, you know, you could do it?
HEE-WON HAN:  Right.

Q.  Did you talk to her about what it's like playing over here before you came over here?
HEE-WON HAN: Yes.

Q.  What did she tell you?
KIM (INTERPRETER): It's very tough to travel across the America first.  Then speaking different languages, language barriers. 

Q.  Did she have any miraculous birdies or pars either out of the rough or just  --
CLEWS (CADDIE): I think the first side we made was on the fourth hole after driving it in the rough and it was like just after the first birdie, so to drop a shot after making a birdie flattens it a bit, but she made a 12-footer for par, kept the momentum going, and then she birdied the next hole, so  --

Q.  Did she just have to hack it out of the rough, or  --
CLEWS (CADDIE): Yeah, pretty much.  It was only like 120 yards to the front, but we ended up 15 yards short.  The rough is penalizing, and then she made quite a nice up and down, so it wasn't like a long shot to the hole, it was just the rough is so thick and wet, you are lucky to sort of get some of them out any distance at all.

Q.  You had three birdies on the par 3's.
HEE-WON HAN:  Yes.

Q.  All  -- 16 was your only bogey on the par 3's?
HEE-WON HAN:  13.  Yeah, that's 3-putt.

Q.  How close were your birdies?
HEE-WON HAN:  Just  --

Q.  Do you feel confident you can win this now?  Do you feel confident with the way you are playing that you can win this, or is it too early to think that?
KIM (INTERPRETER): She is striking the ball pretty good these days, and she is very comfortable on the course, so I would interpret that as confident.

Q.  What will she do tonight?
HEE-WON HAN: Tonight?  I just go back to hotel.

Q.  Nothing special?
HEE-WON HAN:  Yeah, nothing special.

Q.  What's the caddy's name, what's your name?
HEE-WON HAN:  Shaun Clews.

Q.  S-H-A-W-N, right?
CLEWS (CADDIE): S-H-A-U-N.

Q.  C-L-E  --
CLEWS (CADDIE): W-S.

Q.  That's Korean?
CLEWS (CADDIE): Yes, I am, yes.  How can you tell (laughter)? 

Q.  How about your name, sir?
KIM (INTERPRETER): Saint Kim.

Q.  Can you spell that for me?
KIM (INTERPRETER): Saint.

Q.  Just like  --
KIM (INTERPRETER): Yeah, Saint Kim.  Thanks for asking (laughter). 

Q.  Are you any relation to the players?
KIM (INTERPRETER): I am from FILA, Korea, and we have a three-year contract with her, and this is third year, so I am traveling with her and kind of assisting her play.

Q.  With Hee-Won?
KIM (INTERPRETER): Yeah.

Q.  Are you related to any of the Kim girls?
HEE-WON HAN:  Not really.
KIM (INTERPRETER): Not really.  I am sorry. 

Q.  How come you laughed?  You can tell us.  Are you trying to get her to sign another contract?
KIM (INTERPRETER): Why not?  I hope so.
