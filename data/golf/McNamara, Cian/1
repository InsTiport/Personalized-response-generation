  CIAN McNAMARA:   Listen, very enjoyable day, for myself, I just want to do a nice bit of practise this afternoon and try and do myself justice again tomorrow.   That's all I'm trying to do.
I think that showed today; that I can play golf on the day but I've just got to try and do it again now tomorrow and see what happens.   I'm not going to panic or put myself under pressure.   I'm not setting any goals or anything. 

Q.   One‑shot‑at‑a‑time philosophy? 
CIAN McNAMARA:   Yeah, big time.   Like basically, as I said, I spent a full day with Eddie Doyle on Tuesday and that's all we were saying, was hitting it quite well on the range on Tuesday, I didn't want to look around but I was like, I can play here.   And the only goal of the day was just do justice for yourself when you're standing up and hitting the shots.
