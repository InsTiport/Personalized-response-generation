  SCOTT BARR:   Yeah, it was a good start.   Just kind of played okay, putted pretty well most of the day.   Tried to avoid the trouble, don't really know the course very well.   This is the kind of course you can get better on it as the week goes by because you know where everything is.   A couple times I hit it and just went, I didn't even know that was there, with one practice round, one pro‑am practice round.

Q.   You've been in good form the last few weeks?
    SCOTT BARR:   Yeah, possibly.   I've been injured this week, so my mind was just getting out of that before I started.   It's niggling a little bit in my elbow.   Yeah, look, I wouldn't say it was the greatest round of golf I've ever played, but I just got the job done.

Q.   Is this a good test?
    SCOTT BARR:   It's a good test with your irons.   I think off the tee it's quite generous here, but the wind is picking up now, and certainly you've got to think about position with your irons, which way you want to bring the ball in, and you've actually got to really set up some shots with your irons.

Q.   You had an eagle in there, as well?
    SCOTT BARR:   Yeah, I hit two sort of good strategy, par‑5, 3‑wood and iron and holed a nice one, so it was good.

Q.   How long was the putt?
    SCOTT BARR:   Putt was about 35 feet.   It was good.
