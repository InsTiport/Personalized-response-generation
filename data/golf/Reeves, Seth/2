Q. Only had two bogeys for the entire week.
SETH REEVES: Yeah.  It was really good, especially in the conditions.  Yesterday was cold and rainy and today was cold and windy.
I think after playing in Napa I just felt like I wasn't getting enough out my putting and short game.  Used the off weeks to just work on that and felt like I was in a good place; it paid off.
Q. I thought you also probably drove it a little bit better in the second round.
SETH REEVES: I did, yeah.  It's tough to drive it when it's raining.  You feel like the club is going to slip a little bit.  Especially I've got a little bit higher swing speed than most.
Yeah, drove it really well on a windy day, which is huge with the rough out here.
Q. Thoughts on the weekend coming up?
SETH REEVES: We're going to have a little bit nicer weather, which will be a pleasure to play in.  Just got to keep plugging away.  Guys are going to make birdies still.
That's the thing, with better weather it may play a few shots easier, so just got to play aggressive to go get it done.
