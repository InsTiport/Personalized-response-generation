 Q.  Obviously a pretty good effort.  Must be pretty pleased with your start here.  
SETH REEVES: Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  It was pretty windy on the first nine; really all day.  But just sticking to my game plan and hitting it well and making putts.  You can still score in the wind.   
 Q.  The way you were scoring, was that part of the decision to keep going as the light faded, just keep that roll going?  
SETH REEVES: Yeah.  I had to stop because of darkness last week and it's just -- you have rhythm out here when you're playing good especially.  Then when I heard what the restart time was, basically an hour and five minutes before my original tee time.  My hotel is 30 minutes away.   
I'm just like, Man, I'm feeling good.  I would rather finish.  I feel like that will do my better for the morning round, to get an extra hour of the sleep.   
 Q.  How has the adjustment been to the main tour?  
SETH REEVES: It hasn't felt as different.  The Web.com Tour prepares you pretty well.  I mean, it's just everything is a little bit bigger.   
Golf is golf, and I feel like I belong out here.  Ready to compete immediately.
