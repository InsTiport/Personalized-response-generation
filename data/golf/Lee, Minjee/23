 Q.  Can you sum up your second round?  
MINJEE LEE: I had a pretty solid start. But I made a couple mistakes on the eighth and ninth holes. But came back with 2 birdies on the back nine so happy with how I bounced back. Today I wasn't able to take advantage on the finishing 17th and 18th holes, but I have another chance tomorrow to better my scores on those holes.   
I've been feeling a little bit under the weather but am still enjoying my time in Japan.
