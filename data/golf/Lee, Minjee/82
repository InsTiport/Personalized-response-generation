Q. You're through two rounds in your title defense.  How do you judge where you're at so far and what can you improve on?
MINJEE LEE: Well, the last to days was very up and down.  So I made a lot of birdies and I made a lot of bogeys, too.  I found myself in some tricky positions today and yesterday.  So hopefully I can kind of maybe hit it in the right sections so I can have an easier putt in.
Q. How was the wind out there?  Was it a factor for you?
MINJEE LEE: Well, I think a little bit, but it wasn't as strong as I guess last year.  So I think it was okay.  It's pretty manageable.
Q. Okay.  So it's a little bit easier than last year maybe, the course?
MINJEE LEE: I don't think it's easier because the greens are a little bit quicker I think.  I guess if you're not in the right sections, then it's really tough to make par or get the putt close.
Q. Anything you're going to work on for the last two days?
MINJEE LEE: I'm just going to try to be a little more steady.  Maybe just hit it -- just try and focus more on my targets.  But yeah, I'm a little bit tired.
