 Q.  Thoughts on your round today, the way you finished?  
MINJEE LEE: I started off well, I was 4-under through the first nine, but I guess I couldn't quite get it done and she was one shot ahead of us.  Yeah, I missed a couple of putts, and they just didn't drop.  So I guess that's what it is, and next event is Evian, so I think I can go one better.   
 Q.  Is it fun battling her all day?  Did you know where you guys were at?  
MINJEE LEE: Well, I don't think she made a par until like I don't know what hole.  So she was making a lot of birdies, and yeah, I knew it was going to be pretty close.  But yeah, no, she played great.  I don't know what's going to happen at the end, so yeah.   
 Q.  Will you stick around and watch at all?  
MINJEE LEE: Well, once I go through all the fans, I think maybe they'll be almost done.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on the weekend, the tournament?  
MINJEE LEE: The tournament?  I think I had a pretty good weekend.  I mean coming second is always worse than first, but it's better than third.  So no, I mean I'm pretty happy with my result.
