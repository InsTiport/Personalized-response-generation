Q. You seemed to know what you were doing on the course today.  4-under, how do you feel?
MINJEE LEE: Pretty good.  I was holing a couple more putts today, so it was nice.
Q. A lot of golf to be played.  Do you feel like you're in a good position?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I think I'm in a pretty good position going into tomorrow and the next day.  So yeah, hopefully can keep it going.
Q. Had a couple of rough results coming into this week.  How do you feel your game is?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I wasn't hitting it bad those two weeks.  I just didn't hole any putts.  It's nice to hole a couple this week.
Q. What do you expect on the weekend?
MINJEE LEE: Just going to play my game.  Just going to try and have fun and smile a lot.
Q. It's always weird to have to play, finish a round, and play again, especially in a major championship.  Just talk about what you did, your day.
MINJEE LEE: Well, we came out really early and then obviously we had that one-hour-and-a-half delay.  But I mean, it was good for me.  It was -- I guess I made two birdies on that back nine, and it put me in a pretty good spot playing this 18.
Yeah, just playing straightaway, it was actually quite nice, because we got really good conditions.  Yeah, there was not that much wind, so I think everyone will be quite happy.
Q. And you're bogey-free for two days.  What do you think has been like the key for that?
MINJEE LEE: Just missing it in the right spot, and obviously not short-siding yourself.  Even if you're in the rough, maybe if you have a lot of green to work with, then it's not as hard.  So yeah, that's probably been the key, and obviously making those par putts.
Q. That's golf, sometimes, right, just missing it in the right spot?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, especially in a major championship.
