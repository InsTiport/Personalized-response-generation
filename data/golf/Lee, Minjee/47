 Q.  How did you manage to pull off another great round in the heat?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I started with three pars, so I was going pretty steady.  I think I made four birdies on the front nine and one bogey, so I turned 3-under, which was pretty nice.   
I think I made three birdies in a row at some point, and yeah, just really got my round going.   
 Q.  You seemed to hole a lot of very good putts on the day.  
MINJEE LEE: Today I probably missed a couple for par.  I think I putted pretty solid today.  I have been putting pretty well the last couple days, too.   
 Q.  Ariya says when she's putting, she just keeps doing the same thing and expects her moment to come.  She doesn't change anything.  Are you like that, too?  
MINJEE LEE: No, I pretty much just pick my line and try to read them correctly.  Obviously pick my line and my speed.  Just every putt is the same routine.   
 Q.  Same routine, and so you just wait till they start dropping, you never do anything --  
MINJEE LEE: I don't think you ever wait.  I think you just try your best to hold them.  It depends on whatever length you're comfortable with I guess.  If you're close, obviously there's a higher chance you're going to hole it, so I guess maybe you just have a little bit more confidence in the shorter ones than the longer ones.   
 Q.  Okay.  So you wouldn't do anything different, though?  
MINJEE LEE: No.   
 Q.  You're not a changing putter girl?  
MINJEE LEE: No.  Not really.  I don't change much.   
 Q.  Do you have a preference going into the final round to be leading or to be the chaser?  
MINJEE LEE: No, I don't have a preference.  You just play your own game and you can't really control what they are doing.  You just do your best.   
 Q.  It looks like you've got your eyes on the prize, ever since I saw you on Monday or Tuesday.  How do you feel at this point, the day before the final round, being atop the leaderboard, only a few shots back.  
MINJEE LEE: I'm pretty hot right now -- but no, I feel pretty good.  I feel like I'm hitting it pretty solid.  I probably hit a couple drives here and there that I sort of sprayed a little bit.  So if I can get that straightened out and hole a couple more putts, then I think I'll be all right.   
 Q.  How does it feel playing with Ariya in the same flight, and most probably for tomorrow, as well?  
MINJEE LEE: I've played with her a lot.  I think I played with her every single round, so it's probably going to be four in a row with tomorrow.   
But I've played with her quite a bit in my last four years, so it's pretty cool.  She's great to play with.  She's fast and just good all around.   
 Q.  Some people were saying she kind of has that aura about her, going into the final round.  What do you think?  
MINJEE LEE: I'm not really sure what that means, if you have an aura.  I'm just going to say she's a great person and it's nice to play with her.   
 Q.  You mentioned that a lot of people don't really regard you as a super highly competitive person, but you are No. 3 in the world and you have very competitive.  What do you want people to know about you?  How do you want to be known as a golfer out here?  
MINJEE LEE: Well, my goal is to just grow the same.  So I would just like to be a role model, follow in the footsteps of Karrie Webb for Australian golf and golf world I'd.  I'd just like to be known as a good golf role model at the end of the day.
