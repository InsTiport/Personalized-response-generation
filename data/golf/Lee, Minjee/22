 Q.  4-under round on the final day. Gave yourself a chance. How was your round out there?  
MINJEE LEE: A little bit up and down on the first nine. I think I made a birdie and then two bogeys and then another birdie. So, yeah, a little bit shaky there.   
But then other than that, I think I had a pretty solid back nine.   
 Q.  What was your game plan coming into today knowing kind of where things stood on the leaderboard?  
MINJEE LEE: I think I was pretty much -- I mean, obviously would be nice to win, but we were pretty much playing for second, I think, so I just tried to make as many birdies as I could out there and just play my game.   
 Q.  Runner-up finish; another top 3 finish here at least today. How well are you playing right now?  
MINJEE LEE: I feel better than the first two Asia swing events, so I guess I improved throughout the Asia swing. I played four weeks in a row, so...   
I feel like I'm in a better head space in terms of confidence. Yeah, hopefully I can have a good week at CME.   
 Q.  What are you doing next week and what will you do to prepare for CME?  
MINJEE LEE: Just going to try and get better first, and then I'll probably do a little bit of practice.   
 Q.  Anything specific you want to tune up?  
MINJEE LEE: Maybe a little bit on my driving accuracy and just a little bit in my swing here and there, but I think I feel like my putting and short game is in a good spot right now.
