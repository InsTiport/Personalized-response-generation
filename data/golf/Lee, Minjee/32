 Q.  Kind of a busy scorecard.  Lots of birdies, but offset by some bogeys.  Was that kind of a back-and-forth day for you?  Or tell us about it a little bit.  
MINJEE LEE: They were probably self-mistakes -- what hole did I bogey?  I bogeyed the 1st hole, didn't I?  Yeah, that was pretty self by me.  I'm trying to eliminate those mistakes, but obviously this being the U.S. Open and maybe a little bit of nerves and a bit of hot weather.   
But I came back with a couple of birdies and finished the front nine pretty well.  Then, obviously, on the 10th, I made a really bad mistake around the greens.  Even the tee shot, it was just not a very good hole.   
Yeah, but I came back with a couple birdies and one bogey.  So, yeah, 1 under today.   
 Q.  What did you do off the tee on 10?  
MINJEE LEE: Driver.   
 Q.  You're laughing at that because you think it was a mistake?  
MINJEE LEE: No.  I just didn't hit it very good.  It was going way right.   
 Q.  So you made a little bit of a move today.  What do you have to do to gain some more ground and get yourself back in the mix tomorrow?  
MINJEE LEE: I think just make as many birdies as possible.  I think because the fairways are pretty generous off the tee, you can really be pretty aggressive.  And then depending on where the pins are, I think you can be aggressive.  I'm not sure if it's going to be windy tomorrow or not, but I think it really depends on that.   
I think the wind really is a big factor here, and obviously just be careful of the 11th hole and just do your best.  Do my best.
