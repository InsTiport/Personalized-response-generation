Q. Bogey-free 5-under.  Great first round.
MINJEE LEE: Thank you.
Q. What was working out there for you today?
MINJEE LEE: I think I just didn't put myself in too much trouble.  I mean, it wasn't that windy out there today.  I could be pretty aggressive.  I had a lot of wedges and I guess pitching wedges into the greens.  So, yeah, there was a lot of the opportunities for birdie.
Yeah, as I said, the rough isn't that thick so even if I -- I think I drove a lot in the rough today, but you could still sort of get close to the pins and be pretty aggressive.
Yeah, I just think when I was in trouble I was able to get up and down, so they were my par saves.
Q. You mentioned yesterday this being a second-shot course.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah.
Q. That end up being the key for you today?  (Indiscernible.)
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, but I don't know.  Like I only dust off the fairways when I miss them, so it's not like I missed it by so much that I was out of play.
As I said, you can still play from the rough.  Obviously it's a little bit of a disadvantage if you're from the rough and off the fairway, but it's not horrible to be in the rough.
Yeah, I think you can still play from it.
Q. Five birdies today, right?  Also, at 18 over here when you were able to get up and down and get those saves, how much does that mean for your round ad far as holding steady and not giving shots away?
MINJEE LEE: I mean, I didn't really drive it in the best place possible to get to the -- I mean, I could have got to the green, but it wasn't in a very good spot.  Yeah, I sprayed it a little bit out to the right and that was probably the miss.
Yeah, hopefully tomorrow I can drive it in the fairway and get on the green.  Yeah, hopefully improve on that.
