Q. Talk about how you got underway?
MINJEE LEE: I started pretty steady, couple pars and I made two birdies on the front nine.  One on a par-3, I think, and one on a par-5, 9th, and I had a bit of a rough patch in the middle, 10, 11, and 12, and birdied two of the three holes.  I finished strong with a couple birdies, so...
Q. How are you finding the course out here after you've gone through a round?
MINJEE LEE: I mean, I played last year so I kind of know what the course is like and just where the breaks are on the greens.  Yeah, it's helping me putt a lot better now.
Q. You've had a strong British Open and you got underway pretty well at Evian.  Is there a sense of confidence that you're putting yourself in a good position?
MINJEE LEE: I mean, it's the last major so it's pretty exciting.  I always want to play well in the majors, so, yeah, I'm just going to give it my best shot and see where I am tomorrow.
Q. What do you have to do tomorrow do you think to kind of continue this form?
MINJEE LEE: Even today I went out with no expectations.  I just wanted to hit good shots and have a good putt at the holes.  Yeah, just take one shot at a time and just stay patient out there.
Q. Minjee, 3-under 68 today here at the first round of the Evian Championship.  Great opening round.  How do you feel so far?
MINJEE LEE: Pretty good.  I mean, opening with under par at a major championship so I don't think anything could go that bad.
Q. You played very well here last year as an amateur?
MINJEE LEE: No.
Q. Professional debut?
MINJEE LEE: Yes.
Q. What are some good memories from last year and what did you learn that's probably going to help you here this week?
MINJEE LEE: Just the breaks on the greens.  I kind of know where they are to get your ball back into the holes and just where to hit them on the fairways to keep them on the fairways.  So just little things like that.
Q. Now you're in the hunt for Rookie of the Year.  You already have one win this year on the LPGA Tour.  How much is that on your mind to hopefully have that goal accomplished as Rookie of the Year?
MINJEE LEE: I mean, it's not really on my mind.  If I play well, then it will come with it.  So I just want to take one step at a time and just play good in the events that are left.  Yeah, we'll see how it goes.
Q. How -- you've played in plenty of major championships already in your young career.  How comfortable are you on this stage?  Does it seem like just a normal event now?
MINJEE LEE: I mean, yeah.  I think I'm getting more comfortable playing in these major championships.  In any event you get nerves on the first tee, but that's just every event that you get that.  So, yeah, I'm getting there.
