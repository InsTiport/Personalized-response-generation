Q. You've played great golf on the LPGA Tour, another good week here.  Perhaps not quite the finish you would have wanted today.
MINJEE LEE: I mean, I turned at 3-under and probably missed a couple opportunities at the beginning of the front nine, but I think I sort of just didn't give myself too many opportunities for birdie, and probably made a bad mistake on the one drive --
Q. On 14?
MINJEE LEE: It wasn't quite drivable for me but I probably could have got close.  I just didn't really -- I guess I just hit a poor chip shot and that was a mistake, but yeah, I probably could have made a couple birdies coming in.
But yeah, I feel like I've had a really good two weeks, and hopefully it just sets me up for the career.
Q. It was a very tight leaderboard coming into the final round.  It was still pretty tight through the front nine.  You and Sung Hyun then separated yourselves and 14 turned out to be the pivotal hole.  Can you talk about what happened from tee-to-green there?
MINJEE LEE: Well, I thought I hit a good drive.  Just went a little bit -- just over drew a little bit and the wind was left-to-right.  Yeah, just ended up catching the bunker and weren't into the tongue of the bunker in the rough.
I thought I hit a pretty good chip shot but probably just a little bit short because if you go over, it's going to be down the swale.  I was just thinking about that, but I feel like I didn't hit such a bad chip shot.  Just came out a little bit short and then I decided to chip it again, which I didn't really hit a good chip shot.  So that was pretty much the killer.
Q. Sung Hyun winning with a closing round of 64, which was the best round of the week by two shots.  What do you say about that and how good of a round was that in these conditions?
MINJEE LEE: I think it was probably coming.  She was playing well yesterday, too.  Probably all week.  I'm not really sure, I only played with her on the first day.  She looked like she was hitting it really well.  Striking it well.
Yeah, congratulations to her.  Nobody can really go wrong with an 8-under on the final day.  Yeah, she did really good.
Q. I know you were focused on your own game and trying to win a tournament, but from a fan perspective, having the world's No. 1, 2 and 3 occupying the top three positions for much of the day, that's pretty cool and shows the stature of the event and how the creme rises to the top.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, definitely.  I do think it played a little harder this year.  I'm not sure if it was because of the greens or the wind, but I feel like the other years I played, it wasn't as windy.
Maybe the wind was a big factor.  I felt like the pin positions were pretty tough in the wind direction that we had on a couple of the days, so yeah, I think -- I guess if you have good ball-striking, then it will really sort of show when the conditions get tough.
