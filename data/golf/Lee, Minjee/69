MINJEE LEE: It didn't feel softer than yesterday, so like I said before, it felt a little more bouncy than yesterday morning, so I don't think the rain really changed the conditions much.   
 Q.  Two years ago you got a top-20.  Right now you're in really great contention for a top-5 and even a win.  What are your goals at the end of the week?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, obviously it would be nice to come out with a trophy, but yeah, I mean, any top-5, top-10 is always going to be a good result, so I'm just going to go out there and try my best.   
 Q.  You're just 22 years old, you have a lot of top-10s this year, including a win.  How important is getting a win this week, especially going into a major?  
MINJEE LEE: I think every week you're trying to win, and it's equally as important, I think.  It doesn't matter if it's before a major or if it's just during the season.  I think it's a really great confidence booster, regardless of when you do win.  Yeah, obviously it would be nice to win this week, especially going into the major, yeah.   
 Q.  What aspect of your game was clicking today, something that you'll take into the weekend?  
MINJEE LEE: I don't think anything really stands out to me today.  I think I just scrambled when I had to and just took advantage of the shots that I hit close.  Yeah, just -- it was all around okay today.   
 Q.  What do you think you'll be improving for tomorrow's round?  
MINJEE LEE: Probably just get my speed of the greens maybe a little bit more dialed in, and I was hitting it a little bit too hard, I think, and the greens are fast.  So maybe I can work on that a little bit.
