Q. What are your thoughts on how you played today?
MINJEE LEE: I didn't start very good, so I came back after  -- I didn't have a very good front nine.  So I came back a little bit on the back nine.  I think I had three birdies in a row at some point.  That was good.  But I didn't finish very well.
Overall, it was an up-and-down day, but it was pretty hard conditions.
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about the conditions out there?  It seems like it's been getting a little tougher every day.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, it was windy starting today and yesterday.  It's been windy every single day, but today while we were finishing toward the end of the round, it started to rain.  So it was a little bit tougher.
Q. You're 1-over for the week but still right in the mix.  What do you have to do tomorrow to give yourself a chance to win?
MINJEE LEE: I think just be patient and just do everything that you can in your control, because it's probably going to be pretty similar conditions.  So yeah, I think it's just all patience around these types of courses, like links courses.
