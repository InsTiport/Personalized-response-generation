 Q.  4-under par 67, four birdies, no bogeys.  You're obviously playing pretty well?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I hit it pretty solid today.  Just beginning of my round, I didn't really hole many putts that were in range, so yeah, I just pretty much took advantage of the par 5s because I could get on pretty much in two on all of them.   
 Q.  So you were playing aggressively on the par 5s, making sure you could get there in two.  I know they are reachable but other players were saying they were hitting 2-irons short of bunkers and laying up, but you've been playing aggressive?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I've been hitting driver on all of them.  So yeah, I've been trying to, I've been playing pretty aggressive.  There was not much wind today, when obviously right now there's no wind at all.  So when I played, it was pretty good conditions.  So I could be pretty aggressive.   
 Q.  Obviously your 4-under is quite a low score, and you're five shots back.  How about that, Tiffany today, did you see that score out there?  
MINJEE LEE: Definitely, yeah, I think pretty much when we played it was like the perfect conditions.  So yeah, I definitely saw a low one out there but I didn't quite think she was going to go that low.  So great for her.  It's an awesome score.   
 Q.  Have you changed anything in your game for this week with the conditions being so different to what you usually play?  
MINJEE LEE: Not like club setup-wise.   I've kept it the same.  The ground is really firm and just -- I don't know, I think I hit it a little bit more punch-heel, just to get clean contact.  But other than that, nothing in particular.   
 Q.  Did you watch any of the men's here two weeks ago?  
MINJEE LEE: I did here and there but not too much.  I mean, I know it's playing a little different, so it's always going to be different for us.
