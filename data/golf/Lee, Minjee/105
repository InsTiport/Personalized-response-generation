Q. A little bit of an up-and-down day.  How tough were conditions, wind, pin positions?  Everyone said it was tough overall.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I think the pin placements were a little harder, and the wind, I think it was a little different direction, so a lot of our drives were not going as far, I think.  It was a little colder today, too, than yesterday, but obviously the pin placements were a little more in harder spots over little hills and tucked around bunkers.
No, I think the course was just playing a little tougher than yesterday.  I wasn't striking it as well as yesterday, so I put myself in a little bit tricky spots, but yeah, doesn't mean I can't shoot the lights out tomorrow.
Q. You're still in contention, and I know last week you came from behind.  Were you four or five back.
MINJEE LEE: Five.
Q. How much does that come into play going into tomorrow knowing just last week you did that?
MINJEE LEE: I mean, here I don't think you move -- I don't think the scores sort of move drastically.  It's just like you make pars and a couple birdies here and there.  It's not like a course where you can be super aggressive and get away with it.
Q. And shoot lights out?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, so if you stay patient and just play your game, and I think if you play well, then you're going to have a chance to have maybe 4- or 5-under, and you'll be close.
Q. Patience would be more of a key tomorrow?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I think the pins are probably going to be in tough spots, and they might firm the greens up a little bit.  I don't know, they can do anything to make this course tougher.
Q. So 4- or 5-under, and you think that'll be good?
MINJEE LEE: I mean, the lower the better, but I think, yeah, that's going to be a pretty good score.  Obviously you don't know until tomorrow how the conditions are.
