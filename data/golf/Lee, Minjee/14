Q. Minjee, how did you feel about that eagle two holes ago?
MINJEE LEE:   I pretty much wasn't expecting it.  I was just trying to get it close to the hole as -- as close as I could to the hole because it was quite a tough shot and it was landing in the downslope.
I think I hit it a little bit too hard, but it ended up going in.  It was just lucky.
Q. Yesterday, similar feeling?
MINJEE LEE:   No.  Yesterday I actually hit a good shot and landed in a good spot.  I think yesterday was a little bit of skill and luck.
But this time I think it was just luck.
