Q. Bogey-free 4-under par to start.  How was it out there?
MINJEE LEE: It was good.  I had 3-under the front nine and finished with one birdie on the 18th on the back nine.
Overall it was pretty solid.  A little bit wetter than the other years I've played it.  The greens are in great condition, rolling really nice.
Yeah, it was a good day out there.
Q. Yeah.  How nice was it to be able to finish and get your round in before potentially bad weather comes?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah.  I mean, I think it's supposed to be, I don't know, raining or thunderstorming later this afternoon.
No, it's nice to be done now.  Hopefully I can get some practice in before it gets a little bit worse.
Q. Is it nice to come to a place where you've had success in the past and get off to another good start?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah.  I mean, I love coming back here.  It's probably one of my favorite golf courses out of the whole year.
Yeah, and, I mean, it's really beautiful here.  I love looking at the pine trees.  Just a nice atmosphere.  I really like coming back.
Q. You've been playing really well this season.  Do you feel like you're firing on all cylinders this year?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah.  I mean, I've had a really good start to the year.  I think I've had multiple top 10s, so hopefully my win is around the corner.
I'm just doing my best out there.  Just trying to get better at my game every single day, yeah.
