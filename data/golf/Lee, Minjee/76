 Q.  So what have you done well so far?  
MINJEE LEE: I've been hitting it pretty solid so far the first two days.  There hasn't been much wind, I guess, the two days that I've played so far.  So yeah, just haven't had to adapt too much to that.  But yeah, I've been hitting it pretty solid, just feed the putts to drop on the weekend.   
 Q.  Do you think it's been fortunate?  Some people have said they have been playing with some wind.  Do you think you just got lucky?  
MINJEE LEE: Well, yeah.  I played a little bit in the wind.  Like today.  Yesterday was pretty calm, like in the afternoon, because I played pretty late.  But yeah, it's pretty much -- I feel like it's dying down or it's died down the last couple of holes that I played today.   
 Q.  Do you typically like links golf?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah.  I like it.  I think it's pretty fun, just a little bit more creative, and you gotta judge all the bunkers.  So yeah, no, I do like it.   
 Q.  Any holes or shots stick out in your mind from today?  
MINJEE LEE: I eagled a par-5 today, one of them.  I can't remember which hole it was.  11.  I eagled 11.  But it was playing way downwind.  So I hit 8-iron in.  And other than that, no, nothing.  And then I made birdie the next hole.  That's pretty much the two holes that I remember.   
 Q.  Just the state of your game right now.  Where do you feel like you're at and then heading into the major next week?  
MINJEE LEE: I feel pretty good.  Like shot wise, long game wise I feel like I'm right there.  But I could probably scrub up on my putting and short game a little bit.
