Q. How do you feel you did today?
MINJEE LEE: I think I didn't do as well as I wanted to.  Obviously the wind was pretty tough today, even probably the windiest out of all the days we played out here.
Yeah, I'm a little disappointed with how I finished.  Yeah, what can you do?  I can improve on my game for next week.
Q. How do you feel you did throughout the entire week?
MINJEE LEE: I think the first two days I did really well and then third day I hung in there and today I had a couple loose shots here and there and my putting got a little cold the last two days.
Other than that, I think I'm hitting it pretty solid.  Yeah, hopefully I can get my putter working a little better.
Q. Anything else that happened during the week positive or negative that affected your playing?
MINJEE LEE: Not really.  I do all the same routines every single day, so nothing really changes much.  Yeah.
