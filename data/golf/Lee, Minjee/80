Q. So nice round today.  Couple birdies on the back nine opened bogey, birdie, but you're looking pretty good going into the last round.  How do you feel?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, pretty good.  I mean, I'm hitting it pretty solid.  Just at the start I probably had a little bit of a slow start.  Didn't really hole anything on the greens, but got it going a little bit.  Just fed off Jess pretty much on the back nine.
Yeah, no, overall solid day.
Q. Any particular points that stood out to you today that you thought went well?
MINJEE LEE: No.  I just holed a couple solid putts coming in, finishing the rounds.  Yeah, just puts me in good momentum going into tomorrow.
Q. Going into tomorrow looks like you're solo third.  Looks like you'll be in the last group unless something crazy happens.  What's that feel like?
MINJEE LEE: Well, I know I'm behind, what, five shots?  Yeah, I mean, I could play pretty aggressively, I think.  I'm sure it'll be a good challenge.
