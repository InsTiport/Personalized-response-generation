Q. Great start today:  eight birdies, two bogeys.  What was the key to your round?
MINJEE LEE: I had a pretty solid day today.  I hit really nice iron shots, solid shots, into the front nine.  So I think I made more birdies there than my back nine.
Yeah, just took advantage of that and put some -- holed some nice putts.  Yep.
Q. How were the conditions?  Pretty cold start, a little breezy, but the wind seemed to get down probably halfway through your round.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, it was pretty cold starting out, but I tee'd off at 10:00 so it wasn't as bad.  Halfway, yeah, it was getting a little bit warmer, but because of the wind, there was a little bit of wind, it was chilly.
Q. Is this a course you've always liked playing?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I like coming here.  It's also my sponsor's event, so, no, it is nice to come here.
Q. Final question:  Eight top 10s this season, including a couple runner-up spots.  How would you assess your year so far, and what would you like to achieve before it ends?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, I've had a pretty solid year, like you said, but obviously a win would be nice.
It would be nice to have a win for the remainder the season.  That will be my goal.
