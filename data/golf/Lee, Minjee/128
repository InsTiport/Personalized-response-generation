Q. I know you didn't have the round that you wanted, but you still came out with a tie for low amateur, how does that feel?MINJEE LEE: Pretty disappointing.  But golf is golf, and you have bad days.  Yeah, it's okay.
Q. What did you think about the course?MINJEE LEE: It was good.  It's challenging and you've got to play good shots to be rewarded.  Yeah, I think it's a great golf course.
Q. What happened to today in the round?MINJEE LEE: I don't know, I just started really bad, lots of bogeys.  I had a double.  And I didn't have enough birdies to balance it out.
