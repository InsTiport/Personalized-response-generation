Q. Minjee, 5-under round.  What was the most important part of your game today?
MINJEE LEE: Well, it was pretty solid all round.  I mean, I didn't make a bogey today, so bogey-free.  Just five birdies.
Yeah, pretty happy with that.
Q. How did you stay so consistent throughout the round?
MINJEE LEE: I just hit the greens and then if I was close, then I would try and take opportunity of my birdie chances.  If not, then I would be able to have a par.
So, yeah, and if I was just off the green I would try and hit it close and make par.
Q. You picked up a birdie on the final hole.  What kind of momentum does that give you heading into round two?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, that putt was so slopey.  I was like, Just get it close.  Ended up going in.  Little bit of luck there.  Yeah, no, nice to finish up with a birdie.
