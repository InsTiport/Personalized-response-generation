 Q.  Comments on the final round?  
MINJEE LEE: It was very bad actually.  I didn't really have my "A" game on.  I had 5-over today.   
 Q.  How aware were you of what Marina was doing?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I didn't even know.  I knew I was not playing well, so I was just trying to concentrate on trying to make a birdie.  Yeah, she did do really well, so it's really good.  Good for her.
