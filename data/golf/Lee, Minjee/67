Q. After Round 1 here in Portland, you were on fire this morning, carding nine birdies total for the round.  What was working so well out there for you today?
MINJEE LEE: I had a really fast start.  I think I made five birdies in a row.  Nice start on the back nine.  I was really hitting it close.
Q. Would you say that your putting was working the best for you today?
MINJEE LEE: I think it was a combination of everything.  Most of the day I struck it pretty well with my iron shots.  I had pretty good control of the yardages.  And I hit some solid putts.
Q. Including your win at the Volvo Championship you had ten additional top-10's.  Would you say you've had a pretty good season thus far?
MINJEE LEE: Yes, definitely.  It's been pretty consistent.  I'm sure -- I didn't know the stat, but, yeah, I've been having quite a few top-10's here and there.  Overall it's been -- it's been a good season and hopefully I can finish strong.
Q. Other than the last bogey on that last hole, how confident are you going into tomorrow's round?
MINJEE LEE: Definitely with an 8-under today I'm pretty confident with pretty much all aspects of my game.  Hopefully I can follow it up with a good round tomorrow.
