Q. How proud are you of the way you finished that final round?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I'm pretty proud of myself today.  I mean, the conditions were probably the toughest that we had all week, and yeah, my ball-striking was about today and my putting was good, as well.  So pretty solid all around.
Q. What's this year been like for you?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, it's been my best year yet.  So yeah, I'm just taking each tournament at a time and obviously just trying to play my best every shot that I have.
It's been pretty special, just the way I've played and just -- I didn't know -- I didn't expect it.  So I guess all the hard work is paying off.
Q. Why didn't you expect it?
MINJEE LEE: Because you never really go into a year expecting something like this.  I think you just go into the year thinking, oh, I'm going to try my best and obviously you want good results.
Q. Did you have any like goals going into the year?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I did.  It was more Rolex ranking goals because last year I had a goal and I didn't quite crack into it.  So this year, I have.  Yeah, I know I have a couple tournaments left but it's pretty cool to have achieved your goal and you can reset.  It's a pretty good feeling.
Q. What do you hope to accomplish the rest of the year?
MINJEE LEE: CME is a pretty big one for me.  I guess the last two events that I have left on the LPGA season, that's my goal.
