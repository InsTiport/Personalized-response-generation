Q.   Could you please just tell us about your last few holes.   I think you were 6‑under for your last five holes today. 
MINJEE LEE:   Okay, pretty much my putter was rolling pretty hot those holes, and I really set myself up for a good opportunity to make eagle on 15.
I hit it to like ten feet and I just converted it into an eagle. 

Q.   What did you hit there for your approach to ten feet? 
MINJEE LEE:   4‑iron. 

Q.   From how far roughly?
MINJEE LEE:   It was 178 meters to the pin.

Q.   Were you scheduled to play in the U.S. Open qualifier in Richmond tomorrow?
MINJEE LEE:   Yes, I was.

Q.   How frustrating is it to now not be able to do that, and will you seek some recourse with the USGA to try to qualify elsewhere? 
MINJEE LEE:   No.   Hopefully if I can get the win tomorrow then I won't have to go to the U.S. Open qualifying.

Q.   What changed for you, or did thing anything change for you, after the weather delay? 
MINJEE LEE:   Nothing really.   I knew I was right there.   I still have some work to do tomorrow, but just kind of gave myself opportunities; played smart golf; I didn't do anything crazy.   Just my putts seemed it drop. 

Q.   What did you do during the delay? 
MINJEE LEE:   Pardon? 

Q.   What did you do during the delay?   Did you eat anything?
MINJEE LEE:   I just ate something and just pretty much chilled with the girls.

Q.   What did you eat? 
MINJEE LEE:   Oh, I ate a banana. 

Q.   So Minjee, you have a pretty good lead for tomorrow.   What is your strategy? 
MINJEE LEE:   Strategy‑wise, I just want to play smart.   Just take it as it comes and just play each shot to the best of my ability.

Q.   Is your next shot your second shot on 16?
MINJEE LEE:   No, it's the putt on...

Q.   Okay, you already hit in. 
MINJEE LEE:   The putt on 16. 

Q.   How long were your birdie putts on 11, 12, and 14? 
MINJEE LEE:   I cannot remember.

Q.   Okay.   Have you ever been in a position like this before? 
MINJEE LEE:   Well, I did win Victorian Open, but it was back at home.   I didn't come from behind.   I had the lead on the final day. 
But, no, I haven't had this‑‑ been in this situation before.
