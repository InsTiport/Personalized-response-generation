 Q.  What was it like out there today?  
MINJEE LEE: It was really soft.  The greens were really soft today.  I think probably because of the rain the last -- yesterday and the day before, I guess.  The conditions are pretty wet still.  Yeah, but we weren't getting too many mud balls or anything, just a little bit of -- I guess the wet grass on the ball.  Yeah, greens are nice.   
 Q.  How did you feel about your game?  You've had a pretty good season, just coming into the week.  
MINJEE LEE: I started well.  I had four birdies on the front nine, and then I made birdie on 10 to go 5-under through 10.  But yeah, I didn't finish as good as I wanted probably.  Had a couple loose shots the last three, four holes, so yeah.  But other than that, I'm putting pretty solid and chipping pretty solid, hitting it overall pretty solid, so yeah.   
 Q.  What do you think the key is specifically at this course?  
MINJEE LEE: Well, obviously keeping it on the fairway is going to really help you with the shots into the greens.  I definitely think it's a second-shot golf course, and obviously if you have a hot putter, then it's going to help all the time.   
 Q.  Happy to start under par at a major championship?  
MINJEE LEE: Yep, I think I'm pretty happy with where I'm at at the moment.  Yeah, I can always build for a better score tomorrow, so yeah.
