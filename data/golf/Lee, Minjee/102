Q. What was working out there?
MINJEE LEE: Well, I sort of -- I hit really good shots into the first couple of holes and I missed the putts -- I missed my putts.  I felt like I was really solid, like my iron play was really solid.  And if I missed my drives, it was sort of just on the first cut or maybe just in the rough.  So I thought I striked the ball really well today.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities for birdie.
Q. How many greens did you hit?
MINJEE LEE: I don't know.  I don't know.  I think I hit most.  Well, if I was off, I was just off.  I was just off.
Q. The old adage is you can't win on Thursday, but you can lose.  You put yourself in good position.  How does it feel going into the final three days?
MINJEE LEE: It feels good.  I know it's only the first round, but starting off well is as important as not losing it.  I think it's -- I think I'm in a great position and, yeah, hopefully just keep going and -- yeah, play well tomorrow, too.
Q. It's a shame that it's a lot our fault, but you seem to be kind of the lost youngster out here?
MINJEE LEE: I'm lost?
Q. You've got the 18 and the 19 year olds that are No. 1 and 2 in the world right now.  Even though you play great and have arguably the best swing out here.  But you get kind of lost in the shuffle in terms of the media.  Do you like that or would you like to get more attention?
MINJEE LEE: I don't know, I don't think it's a bad thing and I don't think it's a good thing, I'm just in the middle.  It's not like I get a lot of media attention, and it's not like I don't get any.  So I don't really have a bad opinion about it.  I'm just in the middle.
I'd like to get more media attention, so I could improve on obviously my interviews and stuff like that.  But also just -- I don't know, just get my name out there.  And that will come with good golf.  So I'm not really frustrated.
