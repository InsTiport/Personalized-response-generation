Q. Another very, very solid day, how would you describe the round?
MINJEE LEE: Probably a little up-and-down.  I probably didn't hit as solid as the last two days today, but putting and chipping were okay.  So I came out with 1-under.  I'm right in the mix.
Q. We are into the sort of business end of the tournament over the weekend.  Does that change the pressures on you?
MINJEE LEE: Not really, I guess, because I can only control -- I can only do everything in my control.  So I'll just go out there and play my game and hit every shot, one shot at a time.
Q. You do look very comfortable on the links, very confident.  How do you keep that mind-set going into the final day?
MINJEE LEE: Just try to be patient and I mean, some of the putts are going to drop and some are not.  I think just take every shot one at a time and don't get ahead of yourself.  Just go out there and have some fun.
Q. Really congested at the top of the leaderboard.  What's going to be key for you?
MINJEE LEE: I think just good placement off the tees and then good iron shots in.  20 feet is going to be good on a links golf course.  Yeah, just be patient and hopefully the putts drop.
Q. Pretty good day, pretty good position.  How do you feel?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I had a pretty solid day I guess.  The conditions were really nice today and the course was playing really great.  I'll just go out there and try my best tomorrow.
Q. How do you feel you're playing -- you've had three days around the course and probably going to get similar conditions hopefully tomorrow as you had today.  So you've got a feel for it.  How do you feel you're playing here in terms of heading into the fourth day?
MINJEE LEE: I probably didn't hit it as solid today than the last two days.  I'll go to the driving range and get that in tune.  Conditions were really nice to play in today, so fingers crossed for tomorrow, too.
I'll just do everything in my control and take it one shot at a time.  It's tough to get ahead -- you can't get ahead of yourself out here because you don't really know what's going to happen.  So just go out there and have fun and just stay patient.
