Q. Are you happy about your performance today?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, I was three back I think going into the -- on the 10th hole before our delay.
I really fought out there.  Just tried to make as many birdies as I could.  Probably didn't play probably 15 and 16 the way I wanted to, but I think overall I had a pretty solid performance.
Q. You have been playing very well, very solid, and you won tournaments last year.  And then do you feel confident about your game right now, and the goal for this season?
MINJEE LEE: Like the last two events I was slowly getting back into the swing of things.  I was probably a little rusty starting off Victorian Open, and Aussie Open I was a little better.
Obviously this week I had a really great performance, so hopefully it's good momentum for next week and obviously the whole year ahead.
Q. The two last tournaments because like home games, and then here is less pressure maybe?
MINJEE LEE: No.  I just take every tournament one at a time.  Obviously I want to perform well obviously in home games in Australia, so I probably put a little bit more expectation on myself to perform well.
But, yeah, I just want to perform well every week, so that's pretty much every time that's my goal.
