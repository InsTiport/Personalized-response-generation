THE MODERATOR: Bogey-free, 6-under 66. If you could tell us today how you made it through this rain and forecast to have such a good round.   
MINJEE LEE: I think at the very start of the round, it was probably not so bad. It wasn't heavy rain. It was almost drizzle. So the course wasn't playing too difficult at that point. Yeah, I tried to take advantage on the first few holes that we had with no rain, so I think I had a really great start to start my day.   
Yeah, I think that's what really got me going today.   
 Q.  How will you prepare for a totally different golf course tomorrow?  
MINJEE LEE: I guess in the practice rounds, we played without the rain. It's probably going to be similar to the practice rounds. I think I'll just play my own game and take it one shot at a time.   
 Q.  Have you become now comfortable playing in Korea and adjusting to the course?  
MINJEE LEE: Definitely I enjoy playing here, and I think because the LPGA event that we had before was on an an Americanized golf course, but here, it's more like the other Korean courses that I've played before.   
So I don't find it too difficult to adjust to the greens, but maybe a little bit sometimes the slope goes toward the mountains, but I think I'm getting there.
