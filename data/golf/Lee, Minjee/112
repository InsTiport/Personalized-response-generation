Q. How many is that for you?
MINJEE LEE: I've never had a hole-in-one before, so this is my first.
Q. And the fact that you did it on a par 4, the hardest thing in golf?
MINJEE LEE: I wasn't really thinking about it.  I just hit the shot and it went in.  Just lucky.  I hit a good one shot.  It's a bit of both.
Q. Can you take us through that?
MINJEE LEE: I think I had 210 meters to the pin, and yeah, I hit my 5-wood, it was a little right-to-left down wind, so yeah, just hit it a little right and then it was going with the wind and went in the hole.  I didn't see it go in.
Q. And what was your reaction, and Morgan's reaction?
MINJEE LEE: She was just like, "Ooh!"  And I was like, "Yay"!
Q. When did you find out it went in?
MINJEE LEE: I was like ten meters off the tee box and then everybody started cheering, so that's when I knew.
Q. Have you ever made an albatross, hitting a second shot on a par 5 or anything?
MINJEE LEE: No.  So first albatross, first hole-in-one.
Q. No aces in your entire life?
MINJEE LEE: No.
Q. Was that bugging you?
MINJEE LEE: No.
Q. That a player of your calibre?
MINJEE LEE: No.  I didn't need to make a hole-in-one.  I just need to play good golf.  Doesn't really -- wasn't really playing on my mind, at all.
Q. How cool is it, though, to do it on a par 4?
MINJEE LEE: It's pretty cool.  It's pretty cool, yeah.  I can't put it into words.  I'd just say it's pretty cool.
Q. When you were walking -- like knowing what you had already done.
MINJEE LEE: You just keep walking and just walk to the hole and take the ball out of the hole and just walk to the back of the green.
Q. Is that shot shape, that draw that that hole requires; is that a shot you normally hit?
MINJEE LEE: It was a right-to-left wind, so even if you hit a straight shot it's going to go right-to-left.  No, I think I hit a little bit of a draw and then it drew even more with the wind.
Q. And when you're stepping up there, is the goal just to be on the green somewhere with that 275 -- I think it's about 275 yards.  So what's your thought when you're standing on that tee?
MINJEE LEE: Well, you want it obviously around the green or on the green.  So there's like a little, what do you call it, like a little hill that you can hit or go over, and then there's like a downslope that you can kind of take to get to the hole.
So yeah, just somewhere around that vicinity and it should probably feed to the hole.  So that was my goal.
Q. When you got down there and you see where that pin placement is, do you look at it and go, oh, that's a hole-in-one pin placement?
MINJEE LEE: No.
Q. Do you look at it and say that was a good spot?
MINJEE LEE: I think I landed it just over the hill, and it was a couple yards short, so I think it was like a pretty flat spot there, so I think it was a good spot to land it.  Not that I was planning on doing it, but just happened.
Q. Did you practice from up there?  It was 230-something to the hole today.  Did you practice in the practice round --
MINJEE LEE: When I practiced it was into the wind, so I hit driver.  It was kind of downwind today, so I hit 5-wood.
