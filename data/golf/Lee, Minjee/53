 Q.  Looking good going into the weekend.  A bit of a hiccup on the 18th, but solid play all-round, and going into the weekend with a share of the lead.  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I made two bogeys today, and they were my first two bogeys of the tournament.  I'm hitting it pretty solid, and hopefully I can get a couple more putts to drop tomorrow.   
 Q.  That is what seems to be the difference from last week to this week.  You're holing more putts.  It's all about confidence, this game.  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, definitely.  I'm pretty sure I'm hitting it a little closer so I've got more looks at birdies.  Yeah, a couple more putts are dropping and getting a little bit more confidence.   
 Q.  How much do you enjoy sitting on the lead?  Do you prefer to be the chaser or are you happy with everybody trying to keep up with you?  
MINJEE LEE: I think I'm tied right now, so it's not like I'm ahead or behind.  I'm just going to play my game.  It's so hot out here, I think you can only focus on your own game.   
That's what I'm going to do.   
 Q.  I have to say there, are a lot of players coming in here, and the caddies look like they are on their last legs.  
MINJEE LEE: It's so hot out here.  I think it's hotter today than yesterday.  Just going to go back and just hydrate and chill out.   
 Q.  Another foot massage?  
MINJEE LEE: Maybe not.  Maybe a nap.   
 Q.  Okay.  Well played.  Brilliant watching you this last couple of rounds.  Good luck this weekend.  
MINJEE LEE: Thank you.
