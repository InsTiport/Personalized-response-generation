Q. You're in striking distance here.MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I don't think I drove it how I really wanted to today.  I was kind of spraying it a bit.  But I recovered quite well some of the holes.  Yeah, happy with that.  Yeah, I think there's always room for improvement.
Q. Tomorrow you put yourself in a position where you can contend tomorrow.  I think you're four off the lead right now.  It's certainly striking distance.  Talk about your anticipation about what's come tomorrow?MINJEE LEE: I played with Amy today and she was playing really, really good.  Yeah, I think there's a benchmark that you have to make around here and I think she's at it.  So just be patient and just take one shot at a time, I think that will be a good path to go down.
Q. (Inaudible.)MINJEE LEE: No, I wasn't going to turn pro anytime -- soon, but not this week.  Maybe Stage 2 Q-School, maybe after that and before Stage 3, if I make it.
Q. (Inaudible.)MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I'll still be an amateur.
Q. Did you know anything about Katherine Lacoste and the fact that only one Amateur has ever won this?MINJEE LEE: On Tuesday night I went to the past champions dinner as Karrie's guest.  So I got to meet most of the past champions.  And I met the actual amateur who won.  Yeah, that was pretty cool.
Q. Does it make you hungry to be in that kind of company?MINJEE LEE: Oh, yeah.  That was really, really amazing.
Q. To be among those legendary players.MINJEE LEE: Yeah, like after dinner, they kind of went -- everyone spoke and told us about what's their best moment of winning an Open.  So that was pretty inspirational.
Q. Did you know Amy at all before your round today?MINJEE LEE: No, that was the first time.
Q. What was your impression of her both as a person and her game?MINJEE LEE: Good.  She's really nice.  She spoke to me, because she's Korean.  So I could speak to her in Korean back.  So, it was pretty crazy.  It was very casual.  She played really, really good today.  She putted really well and she hit her irons really good into the greens.
Q. What's the most nervous you've ever been on a golf course?MINJEE LEE: Today?
Q. No, when?MINJEE LEE: Maybe my first Aussie Open when I hit my first shot.  That was quite a while ago, I think.
Q. How were those experiences and your experiences being so successful in amateur being in big competitions, do you think that will help you tomorrow if you're down the stretch?MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I think so.  I haven't really -- I've been in this position, but not in a big tournament like this, obviously.  Yeah, I think it will be different and I'll just try my best.
Q. Did you see a 66 out there?  And what do you think about someone 35 years older than you shooting that?MINJEE LEE: I met Juli at the dinner and she seemed pretty cool.  And she was -- I don't know, it's pretty amazing to have 66 around here.  So, yeah, kudos to her.  I hope she keeps going well tomorrow.
Q. Another question about Amy, she was in some trouble on 14; in the bunker on 16; in the bunker on 17, made pars on all of those.  Talk about her resilience, and her ability to get up and down?MINJEE LEE: Well, she seems very patient, so I think every shot she like takes her time and kind of mentally gathers herself when she's in trouble.  So, yeah, I think she is very -- she's going to be great tomorrow, if she goes the same way she did today.
Q. When is the first time you remembered hearing about Michelle Wie?MINJEE LEE: A long time ago.  I think a couple of years after I started, when she was, I don't know, when she was quite young.  She was like really, really good.  And she was on Tour and all that.  And she played with the guys and that's when I first heard about her.
Q. Did Karrie give you any advice about being in contention or on the weekend in a Major?MINJEE LEE: Well, at the end of the day we both -- both opponents and we're both playing for the crown, right?  So she's always helping us, but not in that context.
Q. She still wants to beat you?MINJEE LEE: Yeah, definitely.
