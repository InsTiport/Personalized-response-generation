MINJEE LEE: Obviously it's a challenging golf course.  The conditions, I haven't seen them better in the last two years that I have played it.  Yeah, no, I just really like the course because it's so challenging and tests all parts of my game.
Q. You had a couple bogeys to go with mostly birdies today.  What was the highlight of the round for you today?
MINJEE LEE: The highlight?  Actually just consistency for me really.  It was quite hot out there and it was getting windy.
Yeah, I mean, I was just pretty solid all round, so happy with that.
Q. You were talking about the consistency.  You have been very consistent every time you've played here.  How important is that?
MINJEE LEE: Just because all the holes are pretty challenging, I don't think there is an easy hole out here, so, yeah, just being consistent out there and hitting solid shots is really what's been the key.
Q. You came so close to driving the green there on the 18th hole.  When you got up to that front teeing ground, what was running through your mind?
MINJEE LEE: I thought it was a great change.  We don't really have that many times where we have a drivable par-4.  Yeah, no, it was really fun.  Just, yeah, it was just a good change.
Q. You had a great moving day.  Put yourself right back in contention.  How do you go into tonight knowing you're just a couple strokes off the lead?
MINJEE LEE: Obviously I don't know what the conditions are going to be tomorrow, but if it's similar to today, I'm just going to stick with pretty similar game plan and just do whatever I can in my control.
