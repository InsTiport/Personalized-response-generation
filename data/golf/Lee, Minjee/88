 Q.  A final round 69, how would you assess the week?  
MINJEE LEE: I think overall it was pretty tough conditions.  So I think I finished on a good result going into next week.  So yeah, just getting used to the conditions and adjusting.   
Yeah, overall, it was pretty good.   
 Q.  Best parts of the week, was it the final round or other sort of moments that stuck out in your mind?  
MINJEE LEE: No, I enjoyed the whole week.  The tournament was great, and everything was organised very well.  So no -- and the course was great.  That was really fun.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to next week, the RICOH Women's British Open, looking for that first major win, would you say your game is in good shape and you're excited for that?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I think so.  I'm striking it pretty well.  I think I probably need to assess the wind a little bit better.  Hopefully next week I'm on my game a little bit more and hopefully some of my putts go in, as well.   
 Q.  Would you say that coming to the Ladies Scottish Open would be great preparation for the RICOH and something you try to build into your schedule going forwards?  
MINJEE LEE: Definitely.  We're on this side of the pond, anyway.  It's great to be here and just acclimatise and get used to the time zone and stuff like that.  I think it's great that we have the Scottish before the British.
