Q. Extreme conditions and you're one off the lead.  How pleased with yourself are you feeling?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I started pretty well.  I turned 3-under, but yeah, it was, as you said, it was really, really hard out there.  The wind is like gusting like crazy, and overall, I played pretty solid.
Q. How good is your score, considering the conditions?
MINJEE LEE: My first nine was really, really good.  Obviously, there's only so much that I can control out there.  I think I did pretty good.
Q. I'd say you did very good.  Was it enjoyable?
MINJEE LEE: I think this is true links golf.  I think, yeah, the first couple days we got lucky with the wind and now the real wind actually came.  So it was fun.
Q. With this sort of in the bank tomorrow, if the conditions are similar, I guess you can tackle it that much better?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, this is pretty much what I sort of expected it was going to be like.  So yeah, I'm just going to go out there and have fun I think.
Q. Would you just describe what it was like out there today, how tough was it?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, it was really, really gusty.  Not gusty -- it was like the same wind but it was constant.  There was no like break in the wind and it was really, really hard to putt.  I missed a couple short ones, but I think everybody did, and it was really hard.  So yeah, it's a true test of golf I think around here.  Obviously you've got to judge the wind really well, but it's just what it is.  It's hard for everyone.
Q. Are you used to these conditions back home?
MINJEE LEE: No.  Perth wind, it's up there, like it's really windy in Perth but it's not quite like this.
Q. So how do you prepare for something like that?  To go out and play as well as you did, what experiences are you relying on to play so well here today?
MINJEE LEE: Coming into this event, I've been hitting the ball pretty solid, even the first two days.  Just couldn't really get any putts to drop but I think I hit it equally as well today, and I did hole a couple -- I holed more putts to start with, but yeah, it's just so hard to putt.  You have like 30-footers every single hole because it's like really hard to get it near the pins.  It is what it is.
Q. Any shot you're particularly pleased with out there today?
MINJEE LEE: Actually, yeah, I hit a lot of good shots I thought but the one on the par 5, I like chipped a pitching wedge like 90 metres and I hit it to like a foot.
