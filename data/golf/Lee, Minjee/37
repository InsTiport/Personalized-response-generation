Q. Four birdies going out; four birdies coming back in.  Pretty solid finish, too.  How tough was it out there with the wind today?
MINJEE LEE: Actually there was not as much wind as I expected, and a couple of holes we had no wind at all.  I think it sort of died down probably just after mid-round.  Only really picked up right at the end, I think, front nine.
Well, in comparison to how windy it could have gotten, I think we got pretty lucky with how windy it was today.
Yeah, could be pretty aggressive going to the pins and, yeah, had a lot of looks for birdie today.
Q. You have a low round of the day, 6-under.
MINJEE LEE: I do?
Q. Yeah.
MINJEE LEE: So far.
Q. So far.  What part of your game do you think worked the best for you today?
MINJEE LEE: I think I had caught a few short -- I mean, birdie tries, I guess, so maybe my wedges.  A couple of them were really good, and obviously the two bogeys I had I sort of stuffed it up with my wedges.
So, yeah, some brilliance out there and some not so good.  Yeah, it evens out, I guess.
Q. In terms of practicing like driving, putting, how much of your practice is dedicated to wedge work?
MINJEE LEE: I think it depends where you go.  Depends on which courses you play, too.  So some courses obviously you might have a couple more wedges into the greens than others, like this course.  I think we have a lot of looks inside 100 meters.
So, yeah, I think it just depends where I go.  I do a little bit more practice when I have to.  Yeah, other than that, I just keep it pretty general.
Q. Do you feel like your game has been pretty consistent throughout the beginning of the season?
MINJEE LEE: I think so.  I think the real difference is probably in my putting.  If I can get it rolling I'll get it hot I guess, then my score is really different.
