Q. So bogey-free round out here on moving day.  How comfortable are you feeling now that you're done for the day?
MINJEE LEE:   Actually I felt like I chipped and putted really well today.
So I think the back nine got a little bit more windy.  I didn't have as many opportunities for birdie, so scrambling was probably a big key for me today.
But, yeah, overall solid day.
Q. Take us through the birdies on the front nine and the one you had on the back there.
MINJEE LEE:   On the front nine I had back-to-back birdies.  I'm not sure which holes they were, but the first one I holed a long putt.  It was maybe 25 feet down the slope.
And then the second birdie I had was a chip-in, so that was nice, to see it go in the hole.
The one on the back nine was the one that they had the tee up, so 17.  I hit it on the green, so it was a nice two-putt birdie.
Q. I mean, this is just one of those courses when the wind changes I feel like you really have to adapt to what's going on.  Do you feel the same way?
MINJEE LEE:   Yeah, for sure.  I feel like there are pockets.  Sometimes it kind of dies down and sometimes it's really, really gusty.  I think you just have to try and adjust to how the wind is blowing depending on where you are and which holes you're at.
Yeah, I think that's probably the trickiest part of the golf course.
Q. Are you still able to come away with an overall satisfactory feeling knowing you were able to go bogey-free on a course like this?
MINJEE LEE:   Yeah, I mean, I did chip pretty good today, I must say.
But, yeah, I think any day you're going to -- if you have a bogey-free round, and especially in this wind, I think it's a good day.  So, yeah.
Q. Is that something you've been working on the last couple days out here, your chipping and approach shots?
MINJEE LEE:   I probably didn't chip as much the first two days.  I have been working on a little bit of my ball striking to get a little bit better, what do you call it, like hit, I guess, into the middle of the club.
Yeah, I probably been working on that a little more than my chipping, but I feel like my game is coming together for the next event, the next couple events that we have left.
Yeah, it's nice feeling.
Q. What's is there to just look to improve maybe on tomorrow knowing that players like Sei Young Kim are out there are kind of running away --
MINJEE LEE:   Smashing it.
Q. -- smashing it.  What's it going to take to move up the leaderboard and finish up strong?
MINJEE LEE:   You know, probably by the end of it I'll be six or seven shot behind, so I'm probably going to be playing -- I mea, I will have to make a lot of birdies, have a really fast start I think to be able to catch up.
So, yeah, there is not too many birdie opportunities, but you never know.
