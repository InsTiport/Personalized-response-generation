Q. Minjee, can you talk to us about your rounds?
MINJEE LEE:   Yeah, going through the first five holes, I was 2-over, so yeah, I struggled trying to make pars as I went along.  Finishing my round I think I made three birdies on the back nine, so I'm pretty happy with my result and it was pretty tough out there, so very happy.
Q. You said that you started with the two bogeys but then bogey-free after that and you added quite a few birdies to the scorecard.  Is there any of those that stand out for you?
MINJEE LEE:   I chipped in on -- maybe the 11th hole or something.  But probably that one, and then I birdied 17 and 18.  So it's nice to finish like that.
Q. So definitely a birdie there for you on 11.  The chip-in, how far out were you and what club were you using?
MINJEE LEE:   I slightly missed my 8-iron.  I think I had maybe like 145 meters to the pin and slightly missed it to the right and then I chipped it in from there.
Q. Talk to us about the weather conditions.  Obviously we were bracing for some really tough, challenging conditions, but I think you said that you found it more difficult yesterday?
MINJEE LEE:   I think so, because I wasn't really expecting -- like the severity of the winds, and even the practice rounds last week it wasn't very windy.   Once the wind hit me, I was like, oh, it was very tough.
Then today, I think I sort of expected like how much wind there was going to be and sort of adjusted a little bit better to the wind that we had.
Q. Obviously from Perth in Australia, definitely a very windy city, so you must be used to those kind of conditions ^ ?
MINJEE LEE:   Perth is windy and I'm right near the Fremantle, so we always have the breeze coming in in the afternoon.  I have played a lot in the wind.
Q. Heading into the weekend here at the AIG Women's Open, currently tied for third, right there in contention in the hunt, what's the game plan for the weekend?
MINJEE LEE:   I haven't really seen the forecast for tomorrow or the weekend but I'm sure it's going to be windy.  I think just at this point in time, I think can't really think too far ahead.  Just stay in the moment.  Stay patient with the wind.
