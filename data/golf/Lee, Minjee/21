Q. Minjee, well played. 68. Always feels good when you I finish birdie, birdie.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, definitely. There is two par-5s to finish this week, so it's kind of nice you have an opportunity to make two birdies or maybe an eagle and a birdie.
So, yeah, it's really nice.
Q. You get here early. You have played a lot of golf over the last few weeks.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, this is my fourth week in a row, so we've been on the road for quite a long time now in Asia. But it's really nice. We get looked after really well. All the Asia swing events are pretty special.
Q. I hear you're not feeling your best. You have a croaky throat?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, my voice might be gone by tomorrow.
Q. Well, let the clubs do the talking. Coming off of a runner-up finish in Taiwan, what was that experience like?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, coming into that event I wasn't really expecting too much. I just sort of took down my expectations a little bit and tried to have fun that week.
Yeah, overall I had really good results. So same as this week. Just going to try my best and do my best.
Q. (Regarding the queue of fans.)
MINJEE LEE: I guess that's good that it's not both. It's nice because all the fans are out here supporting us even on the first day. It is very nice.
