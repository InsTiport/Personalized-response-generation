 Q.  Your first round, nice opening round for you?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, it was pretty windy out there, so I started with a birdie, which is nice, and then I think I took a little more advantage on the back nine where you could really -- some of the holes were downwind, so you would have a shorter shot in.   
Yeah, I holed a nice couple putts out of range, so that was nice, too. I think overall, it was pretty solid.   
 Q.  I think on 5, you had a pretty long putt.  
MINJEE LEE: Oh, yeah. I just hit it on the green to the right and it was probably like maybe 30 feet.   
 Q.  Was that probably the highlight?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, that was probably the longest putt I made today.   
 Q.  You've never finished outside the Top-20 here?  
MINJEE LEE: I didn't even know that.   
 Q.  What do you like about this golf course and playing here?  
MINJEE LEE: I think it's just a bit of a challenge. You've really got to take one shot at a time because it's so windy out here. I think that just that helps me sort of focus on each shot. So maybe that's why. I'm not really sure. I just try my best every week.   
 Q.  You're coming off a good finish in Korea last week. Are you able to take some positives from that?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, definitely. I mean, I played pretty well. I just sort of made a couple soft mistakes here and there. I guess the difference between me having a like really, really good round and just like an average round is that.   
Yeah, I'm just trying to eliminate those and have a good score.   
 Q.  Is there anything that you work on to eliminate those?  
MINJEE LEE: I think just try not to miss it in the wrong places and just sort of really try and focus on the shot that you want to make or like on the target. That's probably the most important.   
 Q.  Biggest difference between an average and a really great round?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, if your mind is just a little bit off or if your concentration is not as good that day maybe, but probably for me it's that, yeah.
