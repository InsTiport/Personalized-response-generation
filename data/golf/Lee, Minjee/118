An interview with:   
MINJI LEE   
THE MODERATOR: After winning the Kingsmill Championship earlier in the year, that was a big breakthrough for you in your rookie year, what's the rest of the year been like?  Is it kind of difficult to get over the hump for the second one?  What's tougher, the first or second?   
MINJI LEE: No, after the first win at Kingsmill I had a couple good runs.  I put myself in contention a couple times, but couldn't get the job done.   
But, yeah, I mean, I've been having a really fun and great season, so hopefully finish it off well in the Asian swing.   
THE MODERATOR: Do you look at Rookie of the year standings at all?  Sei Young is leading right now, but you're in contention for that.  Do you look at that?  Do you think about it?   
MINJEE LEE: Not really.  I mean, it's like me -- no, Sei Young then Hyo Joo, then me, right?   
THE MODERATOR: I think so.   
MINJEE LEE: I think she's got quite a big lead, so I'm not thinking about it.  I think it'll come to me if I play well.  Just focusing on playing well, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: Three weeks off of the LPGA schedule after Evian.  How did you spend it?  Did you go back to Australia at all?  Come straight here?  What did you do?   
MINJEE LEE: I was in America to get my wisdom teeth out, and then -- I spent a week in America and went home for a week and a half.  Yeah, it was good.  Nice and relaxing.  I could recover really well, so it was good.   
THE MODERATOR: How are the wisdom teeth doing now?   
MINJEE LEE: Good.  I can eat properly now, so...   
THE MODERATOR: What are the goals for the rest of year?  Probably four or five events left for you, seven on the a schedule.  What are the goals?   
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, five events left, I think.  Is it six?  I don't know.  I'm taking one week off, so five.   
Yeah, obviously I want to play well.  Everyone out here wants to win.  If I keep putting myself in contention, then I think I'll have a really good shot at that.   
Yeah, just play well and play smart, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: I know Alison Lee is one of your good friends.  Was it cool to see her in the Solheim Cup, and does that get you excited for Crown next year?  Did that bring back some memories of International Crown last year?   
MINJEE LEE: Oh, yeah, definitely.  I didn't watch a lot of the Solheim Cup, but obviously I think -- I spoke to her after and she had such a great time.   
Yeah, I mean, I'm really looking forward to the International Crown.  I think it's a great tournament.  Just to represent my country is always a good thing.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
 Q.  Where is your game right now for this tournament?  
MINJEE LEE: Where is my game?  We'll see tomorrow.   
Yeah, I've been working on a couple projects.  Hopefully it'll come together this week.  We have a couple more weeks in Asia, so, yeah, be good to sew where I am.   
 Q.  What had you heard about Malaysia before you came here?  
MINJEE LEE: I mean, it was the first event of the Asian swing, so I was really looking forward to coming to Asia.  I guess I really wanted to play all of them.  Yeah, I mean, I heard it was a really great event, so, yeah, no.   
 Q.  Is it living up to expectations so far?  
MINJEE LEE: Oh, yeah, definitely.  Great hospitality.  The course is in great condition.  Just a little hot, but I'm sure I can manage that.   
 Q.  What are you targeting?  Have you got something in mind?  Everyone wants to win; that's a given.  What are you targeting for yourself?  
MINJEE LEE: As you said, everybody wants to win.  I mean, top 5, top 10 is always going to be a great -- I mean, obviously you want to be closest to the first ranked, but, yeah, I mean, just we'll see.  I just want to be in contention in the last nine holes.   
 Q.  Have you played a practice round yet?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I played the pro-am and then I played nine holes on Monday and Tuesday use.  It's in great condition.   
 Q.  Suits your game?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I think so.  Obviously have to hit fairways and greens and make the putt, so it's the same everywhere, I guess.   
 Q.  How did the pro-am go?  
MINJEE LEE: Good.  I mean, I had a good time with my pro-am group.  No, it was good.  And we got carts.   
 Q.  You mentioned what your expectations are.  Do you think about the leaderboard, do you focus on it in the first couple rounds, or just on your game?  
MINJEE LEE: Both.  I mean, I'll look at the leaderboard if it's like when I can see it on the golf course.  It doesn't really phase me that much to look at it.   
Yeah, I like to know where am at.  If I need to step it up, then I'll try and step it up.
