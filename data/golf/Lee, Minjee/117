Q. You must be pleased with how it all went?
MINJEE LEE: Oh, yeah, definitely. The weather was a little better than yesterday. Obviously wasn't raining as much. We only really had to account for the wind. We only got a little bit of drizzle. Yeah, definitely happy with my round.

Q. As you say, you seemed to get the best of the conditions out there. You missed the kind of crazy rain and the crazy wind. 
MINJEE LEE: Yesterday, I was right in‑‑

Q. Today. 
MINJEE LEE: Today, there was only like one downpour, so that was only on the fourth hole or something. So we let it pass and then we played the par3. 
Yeah, I was really fortunate to play in good weather today. 

Q. Obviously going into the final day, looking at that leaderboard, just seeing your name up there, must be pretty exciting. 
MINJEE LEE: Oh, yeah, I was like really excited the whole day. I was smiling. It was really fun. I really like this kind of golf. 

Q. So you like the links courses and that's something that you have been enjoying out there? 
MINJEE LEE: Oh, yeah, I really love the look of the course and it's really beautiful. But I haven't really had that much experience at a British Open or this kind of links courses. But yeah, I'm just having a really great time and just taking it one step at a time really.
