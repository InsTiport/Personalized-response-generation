 Q.  What happened on the front nine?  Really great front nine; not quite as good back nine; still great round today.  
MINJEE LEE: I made 5 birdies on the front nine?   
 Q.  Uh-uh.  
MINJEE LEE: 5 birdies on the front nine; I hit them reasonably close so I could make the putt, but I holed a couple long ones to keep my momentum going there when I made three birdies.   
I had a birdie on 10 and was feeling good, and then I kind of hit some errant shots.  They were still on the green sure but not like -- I mean, not like really easy birdie chance.   
 Q.  Right.  
MINJEE LEE: So, yeah, just made pars.   
Yeah, had a boo boo on 15.  Well, I was just of the edge but I 3-putted.   
Yeah, just 18 I got a bad break and so --   
 Q.  What happened on 18?  
MINJEE LEE: Like you know the fairway bunker?  I was right like at the end but it was right near the going in.  Got stuck in the rough there.  So, yeah, I couldn't stand so I just had to hit out.   
 Q.  Had to punch out?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah.   
 Q.  This is what happened last time when you won, were trailing Allison.  Feel like dÃ©jÃ  vu a little bit?  No?  
MINJEE LEE: Because a lot of girls are playing well and it's not only had her that I'm probably going to be facing.   
 Q.  What do you think about this course?  Fit your game pretty well?  
MINJEE LEE: I mean, I think you can definitely score well around this golf course.  It's not playing super long, so there are a lot of holes that you can kind of really attack.   
And then the greens are pretty soft so you can go for the pins.   
 Q.  I know you said you feel a lot more comfortable out here?  Why is that?  What is that?  What's that feeling come from?  
MINJEE LEE: I think it's experience.  Just being in contention a couple times and obviously having that win, I could kind of, yeah...   
 Q.  Know you belong?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah.  Like you got this confidence to know you can get the job done.
