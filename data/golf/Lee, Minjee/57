Q. Well played today.  How nice to finish with birdies on 16 and 17?
MINJEE LEE: They were both pretty solid birdies, so I'm happy with how I finished.
Q. Playing in Japan outside of the LPGA, what do you enjoy about being here?
MINJEE LEE: Oh, I definitely love this country.  I mean, I love the food and it's always nice to come out and all the fans are out here.  So yeah, I really enjoy coming to Japan.
Q. You're very popular.  We noticed there were a lot of cheers for you as you were striding down the fairways.  What is it about you and Japan that captivates their attention?
MINJEE LEE: Some of my fans came from Korea, so I'm not sure if they were Japanese fans or not.  I feel a lot of the guys out here are cheering for our whole group.
Q. You are playing so well, world No. 5, came close to winning last week.  What's going so right?
MINJEE LEE: I definitely think my putting's improved this whole year, and I'm probably hitting more fairways and obviously having more opportunities to hit it closer to the pin.  I think overall, my accuracy has gone up so my consistency has gone up, too.
Q. Even you, one of the best putters in the game, how scary are those five-foot downhill putts on this golf course?
MINJEE LEE: So scary.  I didn't even know if you could stop some of them on these greens.
