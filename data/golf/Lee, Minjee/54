Q. Not the way you wanted to finish the tournament.  Tell me about your round today.
MINJEE LEE: Well, I had a really bad front nine.  I had two doubles in a row.  Yeah, it was just, I don't know, maybe a lot of brain farts in a row.  But I didn't really hit -- I didn't hit the shots that I wanted very solid, so obviously it didn't go the way I wanted.
But yeah, I mean, I've had a really good run in the Asia Swing, so yeah, it's a shame I finished today like this, but I still have CME left, so looking forward to that.
Q. It was a great two days coming in and you still had the low round of the tournament.  Still some good takeaways?
MINJEE LEE: Definitely.  Those two rounds, they were really, really good.  One bad round doesn't define how well you played.  So yeah, I mean, obviously, up and down for the tournament, but yeah, definitely taking away some positives.
