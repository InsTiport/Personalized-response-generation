Q. Another fantastic round of golf.  It's always disappointing to finish on a bogey.  Just summarise, if you would, your feelings from today's round.
MINJEE LEE:   To be honest, Sophia played so well pretty much all day, and whenever she looked like she was going to make bogey, she would make a par putt, and she made a lot of birdies out there.  I didn't think anybody could have beaten her today.
Q. On those flat conditions that we had today at Royal Troon, did you feel more pressure to make birdies early on in the round?
MINJEE LEE:   I feel like I hit a couple solid shots there, but you know, I probably misread a couple putts.  But I don't know, maybe sometimes with the weather being so flat, you feel a little bit of pressure to make those birdies.  But I think, I don't know, just it's the final round in a major championship.
Q. You had two birdies on the front nine and then followed that up with a long run of pars.  What were the thoughts standing on the 10th tee as you started to head for home?
MINJEE LEE:   I just want to pretty much hit it on the green somewhere close to the pin because really I didn't hit it too well, I feel like, from maybe the 10th hole to probably like the 16th hole.  So I had a lot of long birdie tries, but other than that, I feel like I had a pretty solid week.
Q. First time that Royal Troon has ever hosted a ladies professional tournament.  How much have you enjoyed the whole experience this week?
MINJEE LEE:   I think in terms of weather, we had it all, and the course is great.  I really love old links courses.  It was such a treat for us this week and hopefully we get to come back soon.
Q. You're a very accomplished player, seven-time winner.  Looking forward after this very intense week in this bubble environment, what are your goals now?
MINJEE LEE:   We have a couple more majors to end the year, so I think they are going to be big goals of mine to finish the year, and obviously CME.
Q. Steady round of golf.  Not quite enough in the end but plenty of positives that you'll be taking this week?
MINJEE LEE:   Yeah, definitely.  Just beginning of the week, if you said I would have finished second in a major championship, I'd take it any day.
A little bit disappointing in my ball-striking, but other than that, I had a pretty solid week.
Q. Not many people make par like you did on the The Postage Stamp.  That was brilliant?
MINJEE LEE:   Tee shot wasn't but the recovery was, so I was happy to come out with a par on that hole.
Q. So many positives to take from the whole week.  What do you take in particular moving forward?
MINJEE LEE:   I feel like I had so many up-and-downs this week, so I know I can chip-and-putt.
Yeah, I mean, everything about this place is really cool.  The first time the ladies had a major championship here and I think we had such a treat this week.  Even with the weather, we got to see all of what links golf is about.  So yeah, I'm just really happy with everything this week.
