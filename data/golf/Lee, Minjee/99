 Q.  A round of eight birdies, you must be very pleased with that?  
MINJEE LEE: I'm pretty happy with the way I started today.  I had eight birdies and one bogey, so pretty good start.   
 Q.  How do you tackle this course?  It's a very long course by LPGA standards and very undulating on the greens.  
MINJEE LEE: Well, I only had -- I got nine holes practice yesterday, because we flew in yesterday.  But no, I just took it one shot at a time and didn't try to get ahead of myself.  Just played my own game today and a lot of my putts dropped today.   
 Q.  Certainly a lot of your putts did drop.  How difficult is it when you only have nine holes of practice before you come into a big event like this?  
MINJEE LEE: Maybe it's better.  I think it was pretty similar for a lot of the girls out here.  I just took it as it is.  It's okay.   
 Q.  And this is a pretty fabulous place to come to, it's a wonderful hotel, great golf course.  It's a good week on the LPGA Tour?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, we have an amazing view from our hotel room and the course is in great condition.  I think we're really lucky to be here.   
 Q.  You have a host of players that are also playing extremely well.  The game plan going into tomorrow?  
MINJEE LEE: Just the same as today.  Just play my own game and just do whatever I can to just do whatever is in my control.  Yeah, just take one shot at a time.
