Q. 66 today.  Build off the momentum from yesterday's round?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I think so.  I've been striking it pretty good yesterday and today as well.  No, it really does help in this wind.
Q. Conditions a little bit easier today as far as the wind goes?
MINJEE LEE: At the start it was really windy, and then I think around maybe 4:30 to 5:30 it calmed down a little bit and then it picked up again on the last couple holes.
Yeah, no, it was I think -- no, it was pretty similar.  Maybe a little easier, like a three-hole stretch, but otherwise pretty similar.
Q. Did you come out pretty aggressive as far as attacking the pins or...
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I mean, we have two par-5s in a row on the front -- wait, on the back nine.  They were both front pins, so you could be pretty aggressive with them.
I holed a couple of nice putts and, yeah, just got my momentum going on the front nine.  I birdied 8 and 9, so I think the momentum carried on through the back nine.
Q. Are you real comfortable on these greens?  Seem to be putting real well.
MINJEE LEE: I missed a couple, but you're not always going to hole everything.  Yeah, I mean, I think I've been reading it pretty well with my caddie the last day and today.
Yeah, hopefully can keep it going for the weekend.
Q. Come out here and see a few good scores in the morning round...
MINJEE LEE: Oh, I actually didn't see it until like the -- there is a leaderboard on 13 or 14, isn't there?
Q. Yeah.
MINJEE LEE: I was like, oh, okay, and then I just carried on.  Yeah.
I'm pretty sure it was really windy in the morning as well.
Q. (Regarding scoreboard watching.)
MINJEE LEE: I haven't been.  Just been having fun and hitting my shots one shot at time.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.
