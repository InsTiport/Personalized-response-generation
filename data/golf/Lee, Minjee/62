Q: How does it feel to be on the Asia Swing and to be here in China?   
MINJEE LEE: I love coming to Asia. Obviously my roots are Asian, so yeah I do love coming back here.   
Q: Have you spent much time in Shanghai before?   
MINJEE LEE: Iâve been here twice before, but Iâve only been around the city once. Itâs my first time at this golf course.   
Q: What do you think of the golf course?   
MINJEE LEE: I like it. I played it today and I think itâs a great setup to be long. Itâs definitely going to be an advantage to longer hitters. Itâs in great condition.
