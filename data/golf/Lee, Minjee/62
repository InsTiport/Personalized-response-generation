Q. (In progress. )
SARAH JANE SMITH: Yeah, I think we played really well.  Definitely feels like a loss.  I mean, I think we both felt like we were in pretty good control of the match, so to come away with a square doesn't feel like a win.
Q. We have no English television at all.  Can you walk us through the five birdies.
SARAH JANE SMITH: Yep.  Where did we birdie?
MINJEE LEE: She birdied the...
Q. You were 5-under through 12 according to the scorecard.
SARAH JANE SMITH: Okay, birdied 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and then -- but you birdied 14.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, true.
Q. You were 3-up through 11, weren't you?
SARAH JANE SMITH: Yes.
Q. So 3, 5, 7 and 9?
MINJEE LEE: Eagled 14.
Q. Do you know what you hit into those and how long the putts were?
SARAH JANE SMITH: 3...
MINJEE LEE: Mine were probably inside eight feet, inside seven feet.
SARAH JANE SMITH: Yeah.  Oh, that one might have even been closer.
MINJEE LEE: One was just tap-in.
SARAH JANE SMITH: Yeah, 14 was a tap-in.
MINJEE LEE: Yours was pretty close, too, like five feet, eight feet.
SARAH JANE SMITH: The longest one was probably 9; 3-hybrid to 20 feet.
Q. When you look at the day do you view it is as win that you kind of lost or...
SARAH JANE SMITH: Yeah, I think we worked well as a team.  In that respect I'm really happy with the day.
But I think for both of us it feels like a loss.  We played well enough to win the match and it was just the last couple holes that got away from us a bit.
Q. We were surprised that there weren't as many people on the first tee this morning.  Of course they all showed up for Korea.  Was that an advantage?  Disadvantage?  Did it in not matter?
MINJEE LEE: I don't think it mattered.
SARAH JANE SMITH: I don't think it mattered, no.
MINJEE LEE: Would've been nice to have probably more people on the first tee, but I think either way we just play our own game.  It's not really a...
Q. In the first match out, how much pressure do you feel that you've really got to set the tone for your team?
MINJEE LEE: I think we did pretty good.
SARAH JANE SMITH: Yeah.  Like Minjee said at one point out there, we just have to worry been ourself and then get our match taken care of then cheer on the others if that was the case.
Yeah, I think it's a team game, but I think you have to be involved in your little team while you're playing.  Then back at the end if you can.
