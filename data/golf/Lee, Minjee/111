 Q.  Did you have a number in mind that you would have to shoot today?  
MINJEE LEE: Well, yesterday I spoke to my coach and he was like, You're only five back.  Just shoot 8-under and you'll be fine.  And I shot 8-under, so that was good.   
 Q.  Did you have a point on the back nine today that you realized that you were tied for the lead?  
MINJEE LEE: I think after I went eagle, birdie, birdie, I think the second birdie I was like, Oh, I'm going to be really close.   
I just did all I could do, and, yeah, here I am.   
 Q.  Big year ahead of us.  What is does this do for your confidence going into this stretch?  
MINJEE LEE: Definitely a big confidence boost.  Last couple of weeks I was there, but not quite there.  Now my game seems to be coming together really well.  Yeah, it's nice.
