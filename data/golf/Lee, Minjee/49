 Q.  Great round today.  Can you tell us a bit more about how you felt about your round today?  
MINJEE LEE: I had a bit of an up-and-down front nine.  I made -- I think I made three bogeys, and I made one eagle and two other birdies on the front nine.  So I turned 1-under.   
I was a little bit more -- a little more consistent on the back nine and I finished with three birdies.  Yeah, it was nice to finish with birdies.   
 Q.  Can you tell us more about the eagle that you made?  Solid shot was amazing.  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, it never really left the hole.  It was tracking pretty much the whole way.  I was just off the right of the green.  I probably had like maybe 25 to 30 meters to go across the green.   
So yeah, it was a very -- it was a good chip, just rolled all the way into the hole.   
 Q.  And so you're one of the leaders for today.  What do you think you need to work on for tomorrow and the rest of the tournament?  
MINJEE LEE: The course is actually playing pretty tough.  I mean, it's a bit more bouncier and it's, I guess, I have a couple longer clubs into some of the holes.  It is playing a little longer for me.   
So just keep hitting fairways and try and get a little bit more length off the tee and have a good short game.  That's pretty much what I'm going to work on.   
 Q.  And you came in second last week.  How has that helped or how has that built your confidence for this week, as well?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, it gives me pretty great confidence.  I finished second last week, and I just wanted to bring the momentum into this week.   
So I feel like I'm striking it pretty solid and my putting is pretty solid, too.  So yeah, I'm hoping for a good -- I'm hoping to have a good next three -- how do you -- I can't even speak right now.  I'm hoping to take that momentum into the next three days.
