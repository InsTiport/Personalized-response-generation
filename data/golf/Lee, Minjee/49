Q. It was pretty hot out there.  How did you affect you and you how did you manage to try to keep up with the group in front of you?  It's difficult.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, it was really hot out there.  Probably a little bit (indiscernible) with the cloud cover today than yesterday.  Yeah, we were on the (indiscernible) for only about four or five holes.  I think it was probably better because we could just get play moving along.
Yeah, I think it worked.
Q. How do you feel your golf is at the moment?  Do you feel primed and ready to go?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I feel pretty solid.  I've been holing a couple more putts this week than the other two weeks that I played, so that's a good sign.  I have been hitting it pretty solid, so that's pretty nice, too.
Q. You had about seven weeks home, didn't you, over the break.  I presume you did some work.  What did you really focus on in the off-season?
MINJEE LEE: We really focused on trying get my technique in a better place so I could swing a little bit quicker and try and get my swing speed up a little bit, but I'm not sure if that was really working.  When I just go out there, I just go out and play, so, yeah.
Q. Fair enough.  What do you think the weeks that you go out and win, what's the key for you?  Is it around the greens?  Is it a mental thing?  What kind of clicks?
MINJEE LEE: It's probably definitely around the greens.  I definitely chip and putt really well.  Obviously everything, your shots and you driver has to be really solid and you want to hit your fairways, and obviously the greens, so you can have a chance to make birdies.
So I think pretty much everything has to really kind of click into place, but I definitely think short game.
