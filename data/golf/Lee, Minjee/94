Q. Tell us about today's round.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, it was good.  I wasn't really concentrating on that but it was good.  We had a pretty good group.  It was pretty slow out there.  It was hot, as well.  I don't think we were really thinking about that.  I had a good group.  It was good.
Q. How is the course today overall, your overall take on the field today versus perhaps day one or two day two?
MINJEE LEE: It wasn't windy.  It wasn't that windy today, so I guess you could be a bit more aggressive at the pins.  I mean, I wasn't striking it that well, so I think I just got by, making up-and-down.
Yeah, tomorrow is another day, so you never know.
Q. I hear the pin placements were extremely difficult today.  How did you adjust your approach to the pins today?
MINJEE LEE: It wasn't windy, so I guess the pin placements, they could make the pin placements a little tougher.  I just tried to adjust to wherever the pins were.  But a couple of times I wasn't on quite the right tier, so I 3-putted two holes in a row.
It was okay.  I mean, I think the girls did pretty well considering where the pins were today.  I don't think anybody's really complaining.
Q. Are you going to practice this evening after today's round?
MINJEE LEE: Maybe.  Maybe not.  It's too hot.
