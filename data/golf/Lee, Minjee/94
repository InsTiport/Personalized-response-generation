 Q.  Was it tough to get momentum going?  
MINJEE LEE: Well, it was a little bit slow at the start, but no, not really.   
 Q.  You've been in this position before; how do you keep this rolling along?  
MINJEE LEE: I'm just going to play my own game.  I'm just going to do everything that I can control and try and have fun.   
 Q.  Which parts of your game do you think are working best right now?  
MINJEE LEE: My ball-striking is pretty good and my driving, so obviously it's a little easier to get on the green and obviously have closer putts.   
 Q.  With this course playing the way it is, do you think that's an asset?  
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I guess so.   
 Q.  4-under today in the third round of the ANA Inspiration; how are you feeling about the round?  
MINJEE LEE: Pretty good.  I started off with two birdies and started off well today.  I think overall I had a pretty solid day even though I had two bogeys.   
 Q.  You're coming off of two missed cuts.  You said you were really struggling with your putting.  What's changed for you this week?  
MINJEE LEE: I think it's more belief.  I know it's there, but obviously I haven't -- I wasn't seeing them go in.  So yeah, this week I've been holing a couple more putts, so it's nice.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be in contention here at a major championship?  
MINJEE LEE: I mean, I'd take it anyway.  Yeah, it feels really good coming off two missed cuts, obviously.  I wasn't feeling too good.  But going into tomorrow, I'm just going to try and have fun.
