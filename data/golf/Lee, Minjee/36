 Q.  Sitting in the lead at 7-under.  Big part of your effort, an eagle on the 14th.  How did you react when you made contact on your second shot?  
MINJEE LEE: Actually out of all the ones that I have been close to making, I think that's the only one that I actually saw like drop into the hole.   
So, yeah, no, it was pretty cool to see it happen for the first time.   
 Q.  You've had a 66 this week and a 66 here last year.  What about the course let's you showcase your game so well?  
MINJEE LEE: I think like it's a second-shot golf course, so obviously it's pretty generous off the tee.  I think it's really -- if you have your irons on and you have solid iron play then it's really going to help you.   
I think that's what I'm good at, so, yeah, I think that's what is really helping me.   
 Q.  You were one the few players to card an under-round result in the afternoon pairing.  What let's you play so well in the afternoon adjusting to the poana greens?  
MINJEE LEE: Actually, I made a lot of par saves today.  I think like four, five footers, and that's really important will the poana greens, especially in the afternoon.   
So I think that really helped me with my score today.  And, yeah, just grinded it out there and just stayed patient.   
 Q.  In the lead heading into the weekend.  What are you hoping to take from your game in the first two rounds heading into the final two?  
MINJEE LEE: I think with the poana greens I'm going to be in the last group tomorrow.  Just stay patient and hopefully the wind doesn't get up too much.  Just navigate around the course, yeah, just one shot at a time.
