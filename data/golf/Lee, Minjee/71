Q. Always hard to answer these questions when you've just walked off the golf course.  It's been a great week for you but so close in the end.  How are you feeling?
MINJEE LEE: I think overall, I played really well this whole week.  Yeah, I mean, it was a great tournament and congratulations to Ariya.
Q. Tell me about the final hole?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I hit 50-degree in.  I had like 106 metres to the pin.  I was just behind the hole but I obviously missed the putt.  Didn't quite get into the playoff, so, yeah, overall it was a good week.
Q. Final day 66, not much more you can do in these situations, is there, and you managed to play in pretty much every single condition that Scottish weather can give you this week, so very happy with yourself?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, I was striking the ball pretty well, and putting probably the best I have out of the last three days, four days.  So overall it was a good week and looking forward to next week.
