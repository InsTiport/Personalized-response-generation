 Q.  Good solid round tee to green and on the greens as well.  4-under yesterday; 3-under today.  Scores here typically aren't as low in the afternoon.  Which was the better round in your mind?  
MINJEE LEE: I think yesterday, but obviously the greens were not as I guess rolling as nice like in comparison to the morning and afternoon.  I think equally as solid.  Some putts are going to go in and some aren't.  Yeah, overall pretty solid.   
 Q.  As a player, do you get a sense early in the week when you feel like your game is in good enough shape to perhaps contend?  
MINJEE LEE: I think so.  I think everybody has got the vibes of their golf.  I think it's just you go out there and you prepare for your first shot that you're going to hit.   
It's not like you can prepare for everything that's coming for you.  Yeah, just be confident on your first tee shot.   
 Q.  You were asked yesterday about your goals for this year.  You said you would like to get a couple more wins, two or three more wins - you had one last year - but also a major under your belt.  How tough is it this week to keep next week in the back of your mind when you're playing well here?  
MINJEE LEE: I think it's just going to be a confidence thing.  I don't think it's like you think about next week saying this week is a preparation or anything.   
I think every week I go in each event I take it as it comes and try and do my every week.  Yeah, I mean, obviously it would be nice to perform well in a major, but just got to concentrate on this week first.   
 Q.  You're from one of my favorite cities on earth, Perth Western Australia.  I explain to people it's kind of like an under crowded San Diego.  Any similarities to home?  
MINJEE LEE: Oh, yeah.  This is probably the closest we come to home in terms of weather, the ocean.  It's just really nice.
