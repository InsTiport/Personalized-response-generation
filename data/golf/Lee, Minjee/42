Q. So it was a good round, other than little hiccup on the final hole.  Still, 4-under.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, bad decision making on my behalf.  Yeah, I was pretty steady the first nine.  I had 1-under -- I turned 1-under, and I guess like the start of the back nine I think I had three or four birdies in the first four or five holes.
Yeah, no, got a little bit of my putter rolling there, so finished with 4-under.
Q. Even going back to last year, you're playing really, really good golf.  What's going on with you?  Are you practicing things?  What's been driving your good play?
MINJEE LEE: I think I'm just a little more consistent in all aspects of my game.  I'm hitting more fairways, more greens, so obviously more opportunities for birdies.
So I think that's just really helping.  Yeah, just been working really hard.  I mean, everybody is working very hard, but I just feel like I'm always trying to better myself.  I'm seeing improvements now, which is nice.
Q. What is your next big goal?
MINJEE LEE: Obviously majors are pretty important to me at this point.  I would like to have a couple more wins under my belt this year.  I had one win last year.
Yeah, that's pretty much my goals this year.
Q. Tell us your thoughts on Aviara.
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, the weather is amazing and the course is really pretty, lots of flowers.  Just a really nice walk out there.  Yeah, the condition of the course is pretty good.  I mean, poana greens is a little different to what we play usually.  Just got to stay patient out there and just take one shot at a time.
Q. Feels like good set up, warmup for next week?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah.  I love these events out here on the west coast.  Yeah, always come out here and really enjoy myself.
