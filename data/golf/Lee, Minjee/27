 Q.  Bogey-free, 6-under 66 in the first round of the BMW Ladies Championship. You made it look easy. How did you get today's round done?  
MINJEE LEE: I think I had a really nice start. Started on the back nine and made a few early couple birdies. Whenever I had to make up-and-down, I was able to get up-and-down. So I think that really helped with the momentum.   
 Q.  What was the weather conditions like out there? We're under a pretty steady rain now. What was it like for you out there today?  
MINJEE LEE: A little bit up-and-down. I think it was raining -- sometimes it was raining and sometimes it was really windy, so it just kept changing. Just try to adjust as I went. Sometimes we had sunlight and sunshine. It was just pretty much a little bit of everything today.   
 Q.  Is that mentally tough to have to continue to pursue through that when you got up-and-down and rain and wind and shine?  
MINJEE LEE: I mean, mentally, yes, a little bit, you have to try and adjust as we go, but I think I just tried to have fun out there today. I just tried to keep it really light.   
Yeah, I think that's why I had a good result.   
 Q.  Any holes you thought you played particularly well, or was it just a good, steady day?  
MINJEE LEE: For the most part, I think it was overall it was a really solid and steady day. I did hit one not-so-great shot on one of the par 3s, but it was pretty windy, but I was lucky enough to make up-and-down. Just kept rolling with par.   
I started really well, so I don't know, I think I may be made three birdies in the first maybe five or six holes. So that was nice. Even on the back nine, I holed a couple good putts for birdie, and to finish with birdie on the last hole is nice, as well.
