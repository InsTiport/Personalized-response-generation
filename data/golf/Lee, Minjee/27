Q. Great round of 67 in some pretty horrible conditions.  How would you assess your round today?
MINJEE LEE: Actually the first nine it was beautiful.  Not much wind and there was no rain, but about five holes, maybe six holes to go, it started raining off and on, pretty constant.  The wind wasn't up too badly when I finished, so it was not so bad.
Overall, I think 4-under, pretty happy with it.
Q. You had two birdies and an eagle until your opening nine holes.  What were your thoughts on the 10th tee?  Were you looking at the leaders at any point?
MINJEE LEE: I sort of killed my momentum on 11.  I three-putted from on the green and it was pretty short.  You know, I probably could have had a couple -- a couple more birdies.  I missed a couple opportunities, as well, on that back nine, but after the first two days, I only just made the cut on the number.  I didn't know it was going to be even.  So yeah, I'm happy with 11-under.
Q. You were obviously on the bad side of the draw, which is considerably harder than the first two days.  Looks like you'll have a Top-10 finish.  You must be happy with that performance overall?
MINJEE LEE: Yeah, it was pretty terrible on that second day morning.  Yeah, just to have 11-under on the weekend, I think I'm pretty happy with that.  Maybe next year I can go a couple shots better.
