Q. Like you just said, up and down day but, at the same time, being able to score an under par round with these winds and greens I feel like is a thumbs up.
MINJEE LEE:   Yeah, I mean, I felt like I played really well that back nine, because I think that the back nine is slightly harder.
But I turned 3-under and then I doubled the 11th or 12th hole.  Yeah, it was a bit of a bummer there.  But then I tried to -- I try to stay patient because it's pretty windy out there.  Yeah, couple birdies and one bogey, so...
Q. What would you say is harder about that back nine?
MINJEE LEE:   I think just the shots into the greens.  The slightly -- I mean, I guess the wind, depends on the wind direction, but I think some holes there is like water right next to the green and stuff, so I think that makes it a little bit tougher.
Q. What have been some of your strategies to take on some of these undulations in the greens this week?
MINJEE LEE:   You definitely want to be on the right part of the green.  Just I think I tried to hit a lot of lag putts so in case I was on the wrong side of the green I would have pretty good speed, but it's pretty hard to judge out there.  Some putts are really, really slow and going up some of the hills.  I had a little bit of trouble with that.
But I think with a little practice that's going to be all right.
Q. How did you make the double?
MINJEE LEE:   I hit it -- well, I thought I hit a pretty good shot, but it takes -- the green like sort of is a turtle back, so it went to the left side and it's like a more severe slope.
So I hit a good chip but it just ran by and then I three-putted.  That was just compounding mistakes.
Q. I was talking to one of the amateurs at the Masters from Australia and he was talking about how difficult it is to get back home now.  What's sort of your plan for when you might try to return home?
MINJEE LEE:   Probably just the end of the year, maybe after some sponsor commitments.  Other than that I got nothing.  I'm going to try and get back then and hopefully do the two-week quarantine and have a little bit of time off.
Q. And you haven't been there -- when did you --
MINJEE LEE:   I just came when we had our first event, so two weeks before that first event that we had.  Yeah.
