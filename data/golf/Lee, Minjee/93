 Q.  Did your okay change at all after you found out about the ruling involving Lexi?  
MINJEE LEE: I didn't know the scores, but I just tried to play my own game.   
 Q.  At what point was it that you found out?  
MINJEE LEE: When did we find out?  15.   
 Q.  Finish with a bounce-back birdie, right at the top of the leaderboard.  How do you feel?  
MINJEE LEE: I don't think I'm at the top of the leaderboard, but I had a good week so I'm pretty happy with the result.   
 Q.  Second place, one shot back.  Where do you think your game is?  
MINJEE LEE: I probably didn't come in as solid as I wanted to, but obviously you can't win them all.  So, yeah, I'm taking a lot from this week and just learn from my experience.   
 Q.  What was the biggest lesson you'll take from here?  
MINJEE LEE: That's a hard question.   I guess just try to be really calm and just mentally I think I could probably be better coming in.   
 Q.  Did you hear about what happened to Lexi?  
MINJEE LEE: On the 15th hole.   
 Q.  And what was your reaction?  
MINJEE LEE: I didn't really think about it too much.  I don't know what the scores were at that point.  So I just tried to play my game and that's all I did.   
 Q.  Do you think that viewers should be allowed to message in and have that kind of impact?  
MINJEE LEE: I guess.  I didn't even know she had to drop somewhere.  So it's what it is I guess.
