  Q. You're 3-under now, so what changed from the first two days to today?   
 PHIL BLACKMAR: Well, I played about the same today as I did yesterday. I putted better the last two days. The first day I didn't putt very well at all. I had 34 putts, so that's been the primary difference.  
  
  Q. How are you feeling about it all overall?   
 PHIL BLACKMAR: I'm hitting some good shots. My swing doesn't feel as good as I would like it to, but it feels okay. Putter is kind of -- we'll see, just have to see.  
  
  Q. Any other adjustments you feel you need to make?  
 PHIL BLACKMAR: Just play a little better.
