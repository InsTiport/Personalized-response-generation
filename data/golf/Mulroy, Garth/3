Q.   Pretty solid round of golf?
GARTH MULROY:   Yeah, it was.   Started off nicely, which is always big for me, if I can get some momentum going early, I usually do pretty well.   Hit a lot of great shots, first kind of eight holes and then got sloppy and then finished quite strong, so all in all, happy.

Q.   Did you leave some putts out there?
GARTH MULROY:   I made some out there but also I made a couple decent par saves, so you need those to keep the round going.

Q.   Quite a big boost it gives, qualifying for The Open Championship and coming in here this week?
GARTH MULROY:   Yeah, I've been saying for a while, I've been playing okay for the last two months, but getting nothing out of my game, so to actually get something from it was huge, so I'll take a lot of that momentum for Monday and try to putt it in this week. 

Q.   And nice to start so well here; to get a good round under your belt?
GARTH MULROY:   Yeah, it's just solid.   It's one under, there's not many mistakes out there, I may drop two shots, so two bogeys, three birdies, pretty good.

Q.   Is it nice to get a good, early start before the big crowds coming in with so much expectation and pressure on the home players? 
GARTH MULROY:   Yeah, it's pretty neat out there.   I played right in front of Rory's group, and he usually has ten or 12 people watching (chuckling).   I managed to get a few of his gallery which was nice, added to the atmosphere.
