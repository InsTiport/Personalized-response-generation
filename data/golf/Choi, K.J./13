Q.   K.J., well played out there today.   This golf course you like?
K.J. CHOI:   You know, sometimes hit very difficult tee shot.   This week I practice a lot in cutting ball but in golf course it needs a little draw.   Sometimes in the early drawing the shot in trouble.   Chipping and putting very well today so make many putts.   I'm still trying to do this. 
My goal this year is more inside of the Top 25.   So, more game better and I love it and fans here are fantastic.

Q.   Is the game good?
K.J. CHOI:   My game is more improved.   My putting is improved.   My grip and the change in the left hand change and hit it more solidly on the line and the follow through and the ball line is very good.   My eye and the ball line is the swing and rhythm is very competent.
