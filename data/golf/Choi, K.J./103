 Q.  You weren't really in the tournament as far as deciding what went on today, but nice to win your match, I'm sure. 
 K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, two days, very strong match.  The last three days, I couldn't make the putts and it was a little tough on my body and a big weather change from Houston and here.  It was good to have a win in the singles. 

 Q.  Did you bring Jack's book with you this week? 
 K.J. CHOI:  No.  (Laughing) Long time ago.  It's from Korea. 

 Q.  Overall, you had fun this week and you had a good time? 
 K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, very good time.  Very good organizing in the tournament.  Unbelievable in the tournament.
