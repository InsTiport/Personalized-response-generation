 Q. You came into this round with a chance to win it all. What would you say is the reason for why you didn't play a little bit better to get to the whole title?
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, you know, four rounds is very focused this week. Today is very hard for me, very sweating a lot, so my body, my eyes, not comfortable on the greens. I hit a missed shot twice on No. 8 and double bogey. So today very disappointed in play, but back nine is very good comeback, and then 15 and 17. 
 So far in the TOUR Championship, best score and finish, tied for third, and the next time is winning, step by step I try this.

 Q. Did you feel more pressure because of the $10 million FedExCup prize? 
 K.J. CHOI: No, not really, not really pressure. Only my game. My game is a little disappointed. Sometimes the pressure come, and some hit the ball -- No. 8, I'm really, really good draw shot but wind blowing left to right, so missed tee shot and very difficult. 

 Q. Was your chip-in on 17 more amazing than the one on --
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, it's imagination. It's uphill and stop quick and slow down. It's a lob wedge, hit the green and bounce, and very good chipping.
