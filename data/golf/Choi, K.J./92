 Q.  Didn't quite get the start you got yesterday.  But you played pretty solid after you made a couple of really nice putts? 
 K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, I'm starting pretty good.  Starting at 8, 1 to 8, four feet, 20 feet, 10 feet, you know, missed putt, just touch the hole. 

 Q.  Nice run, though? 
 K.J. CHOI:  Yes.  Very good match.  And turning to No. 10 and Tiger chip it in and eagle and he in the fight. 

 Q.  Right.  Big turning point? 
 K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, big turning.  And he great 25 feet and a putt.  I'm very enjoy today so I'm very quality shot.  Just one missed shot.  I make some good putts. 

 Q.  You had a great week?
