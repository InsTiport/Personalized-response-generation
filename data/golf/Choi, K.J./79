  Q. Did you take your time checking your score?  
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, bogey, double bogey. This green sometimes bump it up three feet, four feet. I miss first on No. 4 and chipped it up to three feet and I push it right.   
 It hooked left to right and I hit it in the right rough. That happened today on No. 6, I think double bogey -- yeah, 6. And looks like very light in the rough, and I hit it really short. I tried chipping and 30 yards, far from the pin. I hit it halfway on the next and two-putt again and double bogey.   
 And in this game really important patience. My focus on No. 8 and 9 is par. Par is very good today, but today is bogey-bogey again.  
 And then last hole, down the middle, usually outside the ball birdie and hit it left, and I want to try right side in the bunker and I hit it left and hit the tree, and again muddy outside and big muddy again, so I can't hit it. It's just a tough pin and then over in the bunker.   
  
  Q. Some of the players today said maybe you should be playing winter rule, pick up the ball?  
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, that's very important. Yesterday we play and nobody answer, and we start, no touch ball, and some mud in the fairway and then some in the layup and the par-5, softer fairway, in the divot. And sometimes back pin came out, so sometimes a little unusual fairway. Some holes were very dry, it's okay, and continue tomorrow no problem in the fairway. But today very tough in the fairway.   
 I'm patient in the last three holes, 3-under par, fantastic finish. I'm very happy today, you know.
