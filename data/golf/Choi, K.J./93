  Q.  K.J., many congrats, another fine win.  19 holes yesterday, 18 holes today.  You're seeing all of this golf course.   
 K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, I love golf course.  Very tough yesterday and today.  Easier than yesterday, but starting the three hole group, and then I pull a long hitter and strong guy, and they catch up on the back nine.   
 Not many missed putt in today.  A couple of hole in three or four feet is a missed putt again.  Very dangerous the hook putt and the grains stronger, more practice.   
  
  Q.  The flags were tucked away.  Even though sometimes the players had short shots in, it wasn't very easy to get that close?   
 K.J. CHOI:  You know, I'm 100 percent which way my shot and then fade, okay.  Left of the pin and 100 percent comfortable and confident shot I make it.  It's tough in pressure and I'm 100 percent shot and close shot in doing good.   
  
  Q.  Tomorrow you meet the winner of Tiger Woods and Aaron Baddeley and they are currently going down the 19th.  Do you have any preference?   
 K.J. CHOI:  I'm very happy, both the guys is good player.  Tiger I love to play together.  Aaron is nice.  Both of them good player.  I'm very enjoy, very interesting and very confidence in this tournament, and in match play I'm great in the third round.  I'm happy, anyway, in the fourth round.   
  
  Q.  Congrats, and have a good weekend.   
 K.J. CHOI:  Thank you very much.
