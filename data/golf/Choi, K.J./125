Q.  Another good finish for you at a major championship, how do you feel like you played today?
K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, very good today.  Putting was difficult in the afternoon, then in between in the trees on the side; the sun in the eyes is very bright and a couple holes hit it bad.

Good this week, very comfortable on the golf course and very good memories of Medinah.
Q.  Did you find the low scores were not there today as the other days; that the course might have been playing a little tougher?
K.J. CHOI:  1 to 15 very good and after 15 to 18 it's a little bit of trouble.  But it was good tournament and putting well and good irons.
