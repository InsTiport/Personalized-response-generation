Q.  Why do you seem to just keep popping up at major tournaments here on Saturday right in the mix?
K.J. CHOI:  My best friend, why K.J. turns around very bad.  That's how I say it, I don't know.  And today I wake up in the morning, I pray, every hole will be the best hole, and each hole is the best.  Today is very good focus and good concentration, a good finish today, very happy.
Q.  What will it take for you to win a major?
K.J. CHOI:  I think my short game a little bit more improved, and putting very well today and yesterday.  Three weeks ago U.S. Bank in Milwaukee, Top 10 is a very good coming the putting stroke, and so far so good.  For a major won, more better than now short game.  It's a more ball striking and better driver.
Q.  How aware are you of where Tiger Woods is on the leaderboard while going through a round?
