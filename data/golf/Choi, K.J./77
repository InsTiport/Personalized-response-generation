  Q. Tough finish, but a pretty solid round in these windy conditions to shoot 2-under par, how do you feel?  
 K.J. CHOI: Today is very good. I'm starting on the first, second and third and not making the putts. Today had very tricky lines and it was very tough to read.   
 Just one thing, my shot I missed on the last hole, the first shot. I hit it too far to the right. Even with the bogey, still I have good confidence in my swing.  
  
  Q. You gave yourself a lot of birdie looks, especially on the front nine, does the wind affect your putts a lot out here?  
 K.J. CHOI: Yes, the Kona wind today is different wind direction, and many shots you have to use your imagination on every hole. Today is very tricky.
