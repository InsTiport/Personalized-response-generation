  Q. Just assess your round.  It was a great round, your T-3 now.  Just thoughts on the day.
 K.J. CHOI:   Yeah, starting yesterday afternoon, so very quiet, no windy, any control.  Even in the morning, it's very quiet in the morning.  Because my game is very improving and short game improved and putting, also.  Very happy in the second round and weekend is more vital.
 Q. What would it mean for to you get back into the winner's circle and take on the trophy this weekend?
 K.J. CHOI:   My hometown is Dallas is very windy, many control shot.  My swing is more improving wind direction I notice on this course.  In 2008, I did it and I was the champion.  It's more comfortable.
 No fans, it's very sad.  As soon as possible, get many about fans coming so we're together.  Happy round on the weekend.
