  K.J. CHOI:   Front nine is pars, starting 10, 11, so two bogeys is very disappointing today.   The last hole is my feel a little different chipping, a little short twoâ€‘putt, but my feel on the best today is always play in control and putting and driving is in control today.   Good position in the first round, keep going and more patient.

Q.   This morning when you saw the guys put up some pretty low numbers, did you think those numbers would still hold up?
K.J. CHOI:   Day by day, different.   Tomorrow morning is no wind and afternoon 25 miles per hour.   This wind keep going tomorrow morning, I'm not sure.   We rest and try on every hole.   But in wind plays very well.   More experience in Texas and windy and my hometown is windy.   Good tempo and good control, so congratulations and the best in the field this week.
