Q.   Six birdies in a row.   Can you talk about that?
K.J. CHOI:   I think the first time it was six in a row.   Very interesting today on the putt and make everything.   Third shot into 9, just got it, one inches, and after that working the putt and everything is good. 
First three days very confusing, the grain, it's windy.   A little quiet today, so that's why more calm play. 

Q.   You gave yourself a lot of chances.   You hit 15 greens, took just 27 putts. 
K.J. CHOI:   This week I'm putting very well.   Inside five feet, 20 feet, 50 feet, I'm practicing a lot.   Even the first two rounds very unusual, my body turn and swing very bad, and many tee shots miss and irons miss.   Distance control is very bad. 
The weekend I feel more better than the first two days, and I am in control more better than the other days.   Today I started with a bogey, but I don't know, it's a feel.   Today is more good playing.   Happy Mother's Day.   Every mom following me, they're cheering for me, so I'm very happy today.

Q.   Is it Mother's Day in Korea today?
K.J. CHOI:   In Korea Father's Day and Mother's Day are the same day.
