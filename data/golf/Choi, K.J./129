K.J. CHOI:  I had a good start but I just couldn't keep it going. After yesterday's round where I sweated so much, my body changed a little bit. I missed a few putts for birdies from close range early on and I just couldn't read the putts at all today. Sometimes I thought it was left and it went right.

Coming through the back nine, I thought I could still have a chance to catch Kevin but the bogey on 10 slowed me down. And then I doubled the 17th with a three putt and that was it for me.

Still, my best result though in the Johnnie Walker Classic.
