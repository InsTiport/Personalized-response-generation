Q.   Can you talk about what you were able to put together today going 1‑under on the final day?
K.J. CHOI:   We talked about it last night at dinner, today maybe in the four rounds and 1‑under par or a couple under par in the final.   We keep trying the patience with every hole.
I'm very happy with every hole with the patience and the focus.   And just one shot miss in the 15, par‑3.   Usually wind right‑to‑left, on the left side, but I made a little cut and a little push in the right side deep in the rough, and I chip out and double bogey.   Just one thing.   I'm very happy final round in a U.S. Open under par, if the future I'm doing better.

Q.   Can you talk about how the course played today compared to the previous days?
K.J. CHOI:   This Olympic Club is fantastic, short hole, long hole, mix it up.   The greens are fantastic.   We have how much release every time.   And sometimes the rough is very difficult.   But even the par‑5 on the 17, very dangerous and very pressure.   
And 16 par‑5, everybody in the second shot, make fairway, more pressure.   My first two rounds bogey on the left side.   But this course is really in good at the moment and good pressure.   The greens are very small target and smooth and fast greens.   Very difficult.

Q.   You got a little bit of San Francisco weather today with the fog.   Talk about playing in that compared to the sunny, warm weather the last couple of days?
K.J. CHOI:   I was keeping me warm in my body.   Yesterday hot and cold and take my shirt off, and then coming very cold.
Today it's a little warm but I keep my shirt and even good weather, four rounds is fantastic U.S. Open.   First time ever, all four days good weather.
