 K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, today is a great match.  He is a great player.  I'm starting in a couple holes with a bad shot and a bad swing, but in every hole was the best in the round.  14 through 15, 16, 2-up, and good day today. 

 Q.  Talk to me a little bit about tomorrow's match with Henrik Stenson. 
 K.J. CHOI:  Stenson is a very long player, is a good European Tour player.  I saw him a couple times in Europe and Asia.  So at the match tomorrow, hope I'm best round tomorrow.
