K.J. CHOI: I remember two years ago in the final round, 6-under par.  So today very calm, the weather is perfect, it is my 15th time to play here and today is the best day.
My goal today was a couple under par makes me very happy.  And North Course tomorrow.  But today 4-under par is a very happy round.
Q. I thought you were putting the ball well when I watched you out on the course?
K.J. CHOI: Yeah, I'm improving the putter.  It's a posture change.  And it happened in the last year, the end of the year.  We did the foundation training in China together.  I gave him tip and he gave me tip.  And been working hard and the putting more improved inside the 10 foot, 11 foot, I make it.  So, still iron play is very nice.  So, keep going to play in the three rounds to have best finish.
Q. One good round on the South Course, well done.
K.J. CHOI: Thank you very much.
