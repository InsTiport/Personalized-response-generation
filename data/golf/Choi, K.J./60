  Q. How do you assess your position heading into the final round?  
 KJ CHOI: You know, is the best finish in my two rounds, and I feel it's good. With Tiger Woods today, very enjoying the crowd, a little nervous and I enjoyed the pressure. But the putting, there's a tricky line and a couple of three-putts. Still, good swings, four shots, so you never know, I'm trying today very hard time.  
  
  Q. What's it like to see a 21 year old up here doing what he's doing this week?  
 KJ CHOI: Yeah, McIlroy is a very long hitter, so here is more easy with par-5s with three, four. I do my best to lay up and try and birdie. Still good chance and in good position for playing on Sunday.
