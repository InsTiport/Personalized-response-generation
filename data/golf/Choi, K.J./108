 Q.  What happened? 
 K.J. CHOI:  Like I said yesterday, every time left-to-right, I'm more left in the fairway and hitting big wide open and cut shot in the left side of the tree and hitting a little pull.  Just hit left side in the trouble.  Just one thing cost many shots today. 

 Q.  So you'll keep hitting that cut tomorrow, great birdie at 17 and 18, you're only one shot behind and in your two wins from behind, you've come-from-behind.  Are you comfortable coming from behind? 
 K.J. CHOI:  Yes, I'm following the leader.  Today is a very good finish on 17 and 18.  Today it was very hard to control shots.  Still swing feels good and the putting is good.  I'm comfortable going into the final round.
