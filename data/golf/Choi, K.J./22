 Q.   You must be happy with today as well?  
K.J. CHOI:   Yeah.   Very good finish.   Better than what I expected.   The two bogeys, starting out two bogeys was pretty bad, but right after that I with a sand wedge hit 107 yards and one foot.   That kind of started the momentum.  
   
 Q.   This seems to be a golf course you like.   The last time you came here you finished second.   What is it about the course which you're comfortable with?  
K.J. CHOI:   This course, you know, you can only hit it in certain places, and you have to be focused, you know.   
And my game within 110 yards, you know, is pretty good, my shot.   So a lot of the parâ€‘4s, you know, I leave myself within that yardage.   And I feel very comfortable hitting that distance.   
   
 Q.   Being from Asia are you happy to see the first official PGA TOUR event here in Asia and what does it mean for the Asian Tour players?  
K.J. CHOI:   You know, I think it definitely opens up door ways for a lot of the Asian tour players.   It gives them an opportunity to check and see how the fellow competitors on the PGA TOUR are playing.   And it only raises the level of play for the Asian tour players.   
You know, golf is a business, so by learning what your peers who are one of the top players in the world are doing, you're able to apply that to your own game.   And having a PGA TOUR event in Malaysia, I think Malaysia should be proud of that fact, and it's just going to grow the game a lot more in Asia.
