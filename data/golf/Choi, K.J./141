Q.  Well, you played in the morning, K.J.  The wind seems to be coming up this afternoon.  Do you think it's going to be tougher for the people that are playing later?
K.J. CHOI:  Maybe.  It's the early morning and it started windy today.  I'm starting at 7:00 and it's very quiet today.  My tee time 9:30, wind blowing start.  All of the players windy.  Maybe today a little tough on the greens and more harder and the second shot very important today, more club in some very confusing.
Q.  How many times have you seen the 5-iron on the 11th hole that you hit at The Masters this year that made people around the world so excited?  How many times have you seen it?
K.J. CHOI:  Maybe four, five times.

Staying home is a little tape -- the tape was delivered to my home later back to Korea, and there's a TV commercial looking at the shot.
Q.  It was great the way you played all week.  That just happened to be a very special shot.  Here you've got a good chance now.  This is a tough golf course.  The greens are going to be fast Saturday and Sunday.  Do you like your chances?
K.J. CHOI:  I like fast greens and firm.  I'm trying to more practice, and the last day in big trouble in China and Korea I was a little bit tired in the body, and then two days more resting, more practice, more concentrate, maybe good tournament.
Q.  Great playing, thank you.
K.J. CHOI:  Thank you very much.
