  Q. Is there anything you wish you would have done differently?  
 K.J. CHOI: I couldn't make putt. He made some good birdies. I tried my best, I can't help how I finished, but all I can hope is to try it again next year.   
  
  Q. You had made some changes to your putting in the last couple of months, were you happy with the way you putted?  
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, I'm still working on it, it's going to take awhile to really feel a hundred percent comfortable, but I'm going to keep on working on it.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the atmosphere out there, all the score boards going crazy, what was the atmosphere like out there for you?  
 K.J. CHOI: No, I wasn't really bothered, especially on a day like this, on the final day, you know, the crowds are going to go wild and it's going to be crazy, but it makes it interesting. I just missed the putt there and that was it.   
  
  Q. You have said that the Masters is the most important tournament for you. Why is that?  
 K.J. CHOI: I came so close, I'm getting better, you come so close to tan people feel like it's so, everything is so near, so it's a good experience, I'm just looking forward to next year.   
  
  Q. Was it fun walking off of 15 looking on the board, you just made birdie, you're still right in the thick of it. I mean is it, even though you don't win, was it fun?  
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, I still felt like I had a chance off that birdie on 15. I just hit a bad shot on 17. But you know what Charl played so well today you couldn't do anything. It was his tournament to win.
