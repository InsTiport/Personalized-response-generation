Q.   K.J., even par 72.   It was a battle out there for everybody.   You hung tough, though.
K.J. CHOI:   I'm starting in the first, second hole bogey double is a very disappointing play in the start. 
After 9, it's more the pace of my body and everything.   I'm starting some wind blowing is very difficult control in the first, second hole.   In the third even, you know. 
(Indiscernible)   and very difficult to control.   After 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the 10th starting the birdieing, so the back nine four birdie and then 3‑under par.
Even, you know, in my swing feel comfortable and I'm very confidence in the hit and everything.   It's more reading the green is more tough inside the 15‑, 20‑footer.
So I need practice a lot and then tomorrow it's a more difficult.

Q.   Yeah, just three shots back, so still right there.   Comments on tomorrow. 
K.J. CHOI:   You know, this course is very patience, so I'm starting two hole, three over par.   You know, somebody going to (indiscernible) up and very difficult and 6‑ 7‑under par easier. 
So my mindset is a little everybody hole and then chance the best in the try.   So this course is a wind blowing is a very difficult.
And the green is very firm tomorrow.   I think more high and quick and stop and go.   More putting, and the iron shot is very important tomorrow.
