   K.J. CHOI: Today in the morning was early, wake up 4:50, so I'm not really on a separate clock, my body, and the head. Starting with a couple hole, foggy today, so a very good time. Then an hour and 30 minutes rest after that and working harder, so much better.   
 So keep going is very important, my chest and posture is more better. We focus on morning or afternoon, either one, one round, 5-, 6-under par and good chance. 6-under par is a good finish today.   
  
  Q. You've gotten yourself kind of in the mix.   
 K.J. CHOI: The leader is at 13, 14?   
  
  Q. 13.   
 K.J. CHOI: So we hurry up and catch him tomorrow. But I need be patient on every hole, and my eyes really better than last time, so line-up is very good, putting better and lines better. Some more rest tonight, and then tomorrow a good finish.
