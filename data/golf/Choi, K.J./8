Q. Talk about playing the North Course.
K.J. CHOI: Today inside of 10 foot, the ocean grain is very strong.  I hit it very well.  This week my iron play and putting is more much better than last season.  Still more confidence needs to come and I need to be more patient throughout the tournament.
Q. Over the last two days, you hit 22 of 28 fairways, you must be driving the ball very well.  Like that tee shot you hit on No. 9 there, you had a chance for eagle.
K.J. CHOI: Yeah, a little right-to-left wind, a little compact driver.  I had a downhill lie at about 275 yards.  So I don't mind the greens, but the ball tried to run out on the greens.  Still over 20 feet, 25 feet, one feet, two feet, so I make it a lot and the 2-putt.  More focused on making great swings this week.
