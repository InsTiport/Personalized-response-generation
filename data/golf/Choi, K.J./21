Q.   You couldn't get anything going in your game or anything out of your round?
K.J. CHOI:   It didn't really go as I planned.   My tee shot was a little shaky, and the putting didn't really go the way that I saw or that I read them.

Q.   Keegan is well ahead, and the other guys are just a few strokes ahead of him.   Is this the sort of golf course where you can go low and try to get yourself back into it? 
K.J. CHOI:   Yeah, this type of course you can either go really low or go really bad.   It's that tricky.   If I shoot 6, 7â€‘under, one good round could really put me up there with the other guys.

Q.   Are you going to work on your game at the range after this?   What are you going to do after this? 
K.J. CHOI:   I'm probably going to rest.   I'm just sweating so much today, it's really giving me a headache.

Q.   Tomorrow morning before your round will you work on anything specific to try to get back into the groove? 
K.J. CHOI:   I'm just going to concentrate on the putting line.   The other parts of my game I think are pretty solid.   But I feel like I want to go out there and practice right now.   But if I do, it's going to make things worse on my body, so I'll just take it easy.
