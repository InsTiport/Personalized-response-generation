  Q. K.J. 2-under, very good round today, but like you said when you came out of scoring, tough course conditions.   
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, very hard. The greens are very hard and the reads are very difficult. I made a tough missed putt inside five feet, and still, my swing and confidence in the golf course, and I am great today.  
 A little bit more in the tough courses, the mindset and more in the calm and patience every hole. Starting in the 1st hole, mindset 2-under par great. It doesn't matter bogey or no bogey, something happen in a hole. So I'm best to try on every shot.  
  
  Q. But like you said, first hole, mindset, stay patient. When you get on the golf course, hard to stay patient?   
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, I'm seven times here, so first round under par.  
  
  Q. First time?  
 K.J. CHOI: First time, first round, yeah, so I'm very happy starting the first round. It's very, very warm, mostly like Texas weather, so I very enjoy it.  
  
  Q. First time your caddie wore shorts, too. Are you going to make him wear shorts first round all the time?  
 K.J. CHOI: Yeah, this is only in the Sony Open. Nine holes his skin burns, and after nine he changed into pants.
