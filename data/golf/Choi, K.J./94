 Q.  You moved on; you're in the field of 16; that's got to feel good. 
 K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, feel good.  On the 17 it's a par and game over.  So I'm very impressed and splash and hit it in the pool and a little jump and I'm on the front left and five feet.  Anyway, in the end I made a good putt on the last hole and it rolled 20 feet. 

 Q.  Match play is just about surviving, and you survived this match, so it's on to the next? 
 K.J. CHOI:  Yeah, so hole-by-hole, so who knows.  And bad hole and then next hole and more wind.  So my style is a little impatient.  I am very patient today.  And the extra holes I hit a bunker shot and a 4-iron, and it stopped in the bunker only 50 yards.  And then 235, a 5-wood, a high cut shot and a soft landing on the front.  And then I make it almost 50 feet and two-putt. 
 Who knows, that's match play.  I'm very impressed and happy.
