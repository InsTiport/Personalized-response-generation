Q.
Nice round today. 

K.J. CHOI:  Thank you.


Q.  Talk about your round. 

K.J. CHOI:  Today my tee shots is better because yesterday I a little bit tired.  My tempo is a little bit faster, and then yesterday morning it was a little slower, it's coming back in the swing, very good.  My eye was very good today, and really important, the greens are playing very good, wonderful putting today.


Q.  Is this one of the hardest golf courses you've played?

K.J. CHOI:  Yes, very, very hard golf course because the second shot and the short irons and sometimes can't stop, sometimes don't stop, and the putting is far.  When the rough is in the ball, it's a flyer, and 20 yards before the green the landing -- I don't know how long in the start as many times.  It's confusing.


Q.  Can you talk about your recent play because you're playing very good golf.  You won in Europe, you're now a member of the Presidents Cup team.  How are things with you?

K.J. CHOI:  After Presidents Cup team I pick up, and then later I'm very comfortable in the tournament.  I'm very proud as everybody keeps going "K. J., keep going."  I keep going every day to practice, more concentrate, focus is very good, and then Germany the last couple of weeks very one, and then come back in the Texas Open good. 

My swing is better and the club, I like it, more concentrating in tournaments very good, too.
