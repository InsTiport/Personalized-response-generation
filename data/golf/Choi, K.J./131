Q.  You must be pleased and could have finished it off with a nice birdie after finding water?
K.J. CHOI:  The last hole is easy but today was not easy. The wind was strong from right to left. I tried to hit it to the right side but caught it a bit left and the wind took it into the water. After I dropped, I was wondering if I should go for it or lay up. I decided to go for it with a five wood, hit it from 235 yards and got it left to the pin. I just missed that putt. Today, I putted very well. I felt comfortable and last hole par is okay, I'm happy.
Q.  What was the key to your round?
K.J. CHOI:  My short irons were very good and putting was also good From 25 feet inside, I felt comfortable and could get some good birdies. The speed is good for me and I'm happy.
Q.  You must be happy that on a new course you can shoot a good score?
K.J. CHOI:  I was thinking before coming what is the course like as I played here last in 1999. There is a new front nine and the back nine is always very good. Before, I always putted well here. I practiced a lot in Sydney from 1996 to 1999 and always putted well here. The course looks good to my eye as well.
Q.  Will it get harder as the week goes on?
K.J. CHOI:  In yesterday's pro-am, I was asking what happened with the tough pins. My putting was very bad yesterday but my focus today was to concentrate on the speed of the putts. I missed a couple from 10 and 11 feet early on but after six holes, I was more comfortable.
Q.  Some big names struggled today. Why do you think so?
K.J. CHOI:  Many times in tournament, you always think only of weekends. But golf is four rounds. Many big names started slow, I guess they have to get comfortable with the golf course step by step. They can always move up very quickly.
