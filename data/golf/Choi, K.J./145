K.J. CHOI:  Today maybe only a couple drivers in the fairway.  My body is very slow today.  Last night a little bit tired.  Today concentration a little bit not concentrating, and I hit drives not so perfect, both sides, both directions.  A couple holes is very good putter, made par, and then second shot very difficult, and I lost in the rough.


Q.  You'd come back with a birdie and come back with a bogey and then come back with a birdie.  Were you fighting your game a little bit?

K.J. CHOI:  The problem is no feeling.  The tee shot is I don't know the direction, so I hit it on the right side, one time right, one time left, very difficult, and then 17 is a very important tee shot in the middle of the fairway, and in the right rough with the windy is too much things.  A little right side is better, but the landing and the ball is in the right rough again.  Putting, made par again.  Bogey, it's a three-putt.  It's a very lucky three-putt and then tomorrow.


Q.  Do you feel well competing with Tiger?  Does that affect your concentration at all?

K.J. CHOI:  Oh, yeah, I'm lucky to play with many people in the galleries.  My shots are better, it's no problem.
