JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Thank you, KJ, for joining us for a few minutes in the media center.  Great start to the week.  Why don't you just talk about some of the things you did really well today, then we'll take questions.
K.J. CHOI (Through interpreter):  KJ always enjoys coming to Greensboro.  He always has a good feeling when he comes here.  This morning when he woke up, he felt like he woke up on the right side of the bed.  Also we've been having a little difficulty in the putting area.  On the putting green today, he actually had that feel come back to him where he was actually putting well.

He's always had a good feeling, good supporters here in Greensboro.  He was able to score well today.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Questions.
Q.  What is it like to shoot what you did today, two back?
K.J. CHOI:  You know, he's really fine with it.  He's played many tournaments, so he knows what goes on.  He's more into just focusing on his game.  8 under was great for him.  Now what his focus is, is keep playing this well and keeping it steady.
Q.  Obviously applause and smiles are universal, but is it a handicap or advantage to not understand the language so he can remain in his own zone?
K.J. CHOI:  He doesn't feel a real strong negativity on having a language barrier.  Probably the only thing would be he wants to thank the fans.  But when he really can't do it, express his true feelings, he has to cut it short, that would probably be the only negative aspect about it.

He's generally able to translate what he wants to give back to the fans.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Thank you.
