  Q.  Camilo played really tough; it was a good match.   
 K.J. CHOI:  Camilo today very good, starting little slow, but he work after 7 was very good golf.  I go birdie, birdie to get there, so I'm 6-under, so very better than last year.   
    
  Q.  You like match play?   
 K.J. CHOI:  You know, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Some holes good, some holes bad, but that's okay.  Next hole try again.  It's very good.  I love it.   
    
  Q.  Just talk about the course.  Do you like playing this course?   
 K.J. CHOI:  Course is very good shape, par-5 and par-4.  Two holes today reachable, and some of the best shots travel, and it's a good setup and match play course.   
    
  Q.  Did you drive the green to about nine feet for eagle?   
 K.J. CHOI:  No, I'm -- No. 6, it's -- No. 7, hit the green and 25 feet.
