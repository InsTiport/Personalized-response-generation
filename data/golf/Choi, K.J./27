 Q.   How pleased are you with today's round?   
K.J. CHOI:   My goal today is under par, have par very important.   I'm starting 3‑under par on the back nine, I have very good control on the irons and the putting is very well.   But the front nine, the ball‑‑ windy, so ball control is more difficult.   A little patience and good points right now, position is 2‑under par.   Stay patient on this course, very hard green, very bouncing, more control on the second shot.   
My shot in today, many high and stop on the green but a couple 3‑putt, a little disappointing, but very confident in the tournament.  
   
 Q.   You've won here twice before.   How much confidence do you have when you come back to this golf course?   
K.J. CHOI:   This course is tough in the trees, which way in the wind going.   My understanding the golf course, and underneath and low shot, and high cut, low cut, all the time in the distance‑wise, 290, 285, and wide open, and it's more than 300 in the very narrow and the rough and push.   That's why my distance control is more better in the tee shot, and more putting is slope and grain is looking more comfortable.   
So, I don't know, this course is very similar to my country in South Korea and some course, with the brown colors and hit it in the slope, it's more comfortable here.
