Q. Glad to be dry?
CLARK DENNIS: Very glad to be out of the rain.  It was starting to come down hard there at the end.
Q. How pleased are you with your 2-over total?
CLARK DENNIS: Honestly I don't know how I did it.  It's brutal out there.  There's some holes that you pretty much know you're playing for bogey, and playing par 4s as if they are par 5s and trying to make a birdie.  There's quite a few difficult holes and the conditions make it worse.
You have to be more creative on a day like this and forget about your golf swing.  Forget about what club you're hitting.  It's more of a feel thing.  You have to use a lot of creativity.
Q. What was the toughest part of the round today?
CLARK DENNIS: Probably just dealing with the rain at the end.  The wind is difficult, but you can handle wind.  It's a matter of judging how hard it's blowing.
When the rain starts blowing and the wind is blowing, you have so much juggling with the umbrella and gloves and towel, trying to keep dry.  It's difficult when the rain comes in.
Q. Is your play a continuation of two weeks ago when you could have won?
CLARK DENNIS: I'm playing well.  I've played well in Switzerland, I played well in Finland and I played well in Germany.  I've been playing nicely and I think this is just a continuation of that.
Q. Where do you think your position will be going into the weekend?  Are you pleased with that?
CLARK DENNIS: Yeah, I'm very pleased.  I'm right there within striking distance.  I know the weather is going to stay difficult over the next two days.  So it's going to be just whoever is toughest, is who is going to win.
