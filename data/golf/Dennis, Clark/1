 Q.  Thoughts on shooting 4-under?  
CLARK DENNIS: Very pleased.  Just one little hiccup on the back where I made a bogey from seven yards to the hole on a par 5, which was really tough to get it to that position in two shots, and I hit two great shots and made a mess of it.  Other than that, I played really well.   
 Q.  How did it feel on the first tee when you heard your name called?  
CLARK DENNIS: It was different.  It's such a great thing, this week, to be here, and to be with Will and have him on the bag.  It's just really special.  I'm not really usually a golf nerd but I feel like a golf nerd here.   
 Q.  Have you had a chance to see much of the town?  
CLARK DENNIS: Yeah, we've been walking around the town.  It's such a cool place.  It's been beautiful.  The weather has been great so far.  This golf course can play so different depending on the wind.  It was a completely different golf course today than it was in the practise rounds.  The wind was in a different direction.  There were a couple holes where I was just like, basically guessing.  You know, what I thought I did pretty well, though.   
 Q.  Three shots back, you have to be pretty happy?  
CLARK DENNIS: I feel like I'm in a good position.  Obviously the scores are pretty good today.  It was definitely gettable today.  I mean, especially the first six or seven holes were straight downwind and real reachable par 5.  Some holes that you could almost drive.  So we definitely had to get it early, and I did, and I played pretty well coming in, too, aside from 14.   
 Q.  Must be quite hard for you playing in Europe and seeing so many American names on the leaderboard?  
CLARK DENNIS: Yeah, it's different.  This is probably the best field of the year, best field for sure in the British.
