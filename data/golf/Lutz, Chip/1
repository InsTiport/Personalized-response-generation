Q. Just talk a little bit about your play overall this week.
CHIP LUTZ: Well, it was a great tournament for me.  To get this far was kind of miraculous.  I was pleased with that.  I was hoping -- I gave Jeff a good match today, and really didn't have my best stuff.  He was really hitting it great and played solid, and I'm really happy for him.  It'll be a great match to watch he and Sean tomorrow.  I'm sorry I won't be in it, but I'm really thrilled to have gotten this far.
Q. Three of the four semifinalists are USGA champions.  Just speak to the strength of this field.
CHIP LUTZ: Oh, it's incredible.  Seems as though sometimes the champions seem to shine and come through.  I guess that's a testament to the experience we gain in these kinds of competitions, and that we're grateful for.
