Q. What was your key to victory today?
AKSHAY BHATIA: I hit three really good drives last three holes, and, I mean, his last two shots on 16, 17 he had to scramble for par.
I knew that if I just do that that he's going to have to do something I won't.
17 I made a really good two-putt and that was huge, because my putting was kind of off all day.
I was kind of nervous throughout the match because it's so important to me, but I got to let that go.  I'm glad that I got it over with and just reset for the next one.
Q. How important is the experience factor in this tournament?
AKSHAY BHATIA: It's really big.  I mean, the golf course changes a lot, so a lot of the pins today were just brutal.  Some you were just so scared to go at.  Especially coming down stretch you can't miss it long.  If you do, it's just such a hard up and down.
We both didn't play our best, but I was down the whole way and it was really hard to tell myself I can do this.  In the end it was nice to get the win.
Q. How can you use a 1-up victory to propel you forward in the next round?
AKSHAY BHATIA: I know if I play like I normally do, if I can just let go of everything around me and what comes with winning this event, then I'll be fine.  I'm not playing anywhere nearly as good as I know I can.  It's just dealing with the nerves and adversity just to get through it.
