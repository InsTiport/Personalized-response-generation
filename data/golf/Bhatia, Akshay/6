Q. I know you played in important events, USGA events, and done well in them, but 17 years old, how tough is it not to be intimidated out here?
AKSHAY BHATIA: For anyone playing at this golf course it's going to be hard.  You hit good shots and they turn out bad and you can hit bad shots that turn out great.  You can get some messed up shots and it's just, you're playing for safety.  Even doing that it's still hard to keep it on the playing surface.
Q. You played in the Junior Am, you played in the North & South here, but playing here at the U.S. Am, how exciting is it or is it just another day at the office?
AKSHAY BHATIA: You just take it as the day goes on, what you have is what you get and if you play good golf, you're going to play good.
Q. But is it something that you have been looking forward to?
AKSHAY BHATIA: Oh, a hundred percent.  Playing out here at the U.S. Amateur at Pinehurst is not something that you get very often and it's just a whole lot of fun and hopefully I can make it to match play and that will be even greater.
Q. 72 out here on this course, then going to that one tomorrow, you got to feel like you're in pretty good position.
AKSHAY BHATIA: Yeah, I'm hitting it great.  I mean, I let some putts slide by, but other than that, it was a great day.
