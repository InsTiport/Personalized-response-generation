Q. So your good playing continues.  You're on to match play.
AKSHAY BHATIA: Yeah.  I'm excited definitely.
Q. What went well for you here these two days?
AKSHAY BHATIA: I strike the golf ball.  My proximity to the hole has been phenomenal.  I'm not missing many fairways, and when I do I'm somehow managing to get away with it.
It's good out here.
Q. You have not played Pebble Beach or Spyglass before.  What are your impressions of these two courses?
AKSHAY BHATIA: It's unreal.  I mean, to play two of the nicest golf courses I think you can step on, it's something else.  The USGA does a great job hosting us.
But I've been telling my caddie and my family like it's crazy that's someone saw this in their eye and designed it.  I mean, it's just undescribable honestly.
Q. You'll be playing Pebble Beach the rest of the week.  How does that fit your game?
AKSHAY BHATIA: I love it.  I mean, that course is more of a cutter's course, especially a lot of the holes.  And a lot of the holes you have to hit draws they're irons off the tee or 3-wood, so definitely manageable.
Hopefully I can just roll the putter a little better like I normally do and should be good.
Q. Obviously you're at a young age, but still, growing up you probably saw Pebble Beach on TV many times.  When you stepped on the 7th tee, were you thinking, Wow, this is surreal?
AKSHAY BHATIA: Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I think more of like 6; 6 is definitely one of the holes you just kind of take it in.  7 is so cool.  It's so short.  How do you not make a hole in one there?
It's definitely something cool.
Q. How is your game?  Ready for match play?
AKSHAY BHATIA: Definitely.  I'm hitting it as good as I think I have.  Even better than I did at Baltusrol.  It's just a matter of rolling the putts in.  Match play is definitely a different story, so anything can happen then.
