 Q.  Can you give me a rundown of the situation that's unfolded here in Dubai, please?  
MIKE STEWART: Yes, we've had a fairly challenging day today with the wind.  Very strong winds this morning and gusting up to about 27 miles an hour.  Those winds increased during the course of lunch time into the early afternoon to the point where we had gusts approaching 36 and beyond.   
The result was the sort of last hour of play, effectively, before we suspended, about 2.25.  2.26, it was such that we had a lot of things going on on the golf course.  We had TV towers that the roofs were blown off.  We had balls moving on the greens -- blew into a bunker at one stage, five trees came down, could it was very unsafe and it was unplayable.  So we brought the players off the golf course, in the interests of play and safety to the spectators, as well.   
 Q.  Very strange situation in Dubai, isn't it?  
MIKE STEWART: Very unusual.  I've been at all these events and this is only the second time we've actually brought players off the golf course for a weather situation.   
 Q.  Where does it leave the tournament?  
MIKE STEWART: Well, I think we're still in a good place.  The forecast for the last couple of days is pretty good.  We don't have any major issues I think.  We'll have winds on the weekend but nothing like days one and two.  Hopefully we can most of the third round completed tomorrow.  We'll still have a bit to conclude on Sunday, all going well.  Still have a good chance of finishing on time on Sunday afternoon.
