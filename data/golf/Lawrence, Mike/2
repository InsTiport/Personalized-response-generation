 Q. Wanted to get you to go over your first round here in the PGA and talk about your overall experience so far?
 MIKE LAWRENCE: It's good. Obviously it's fun to play in the Majors like this and the conditions are a little bit crazy, but it's a lot of fun. 

 Q. How about your first round, you finished up at even par. Pretty happy with that?
 MIKE LAWRENCE: Not really. I played pretty well, bogeyed my last hole, double bogeyed my whatever, maybe 6th hole, which would be my 15th hole. So I played well though.
