 Q. Give me an overview of your play today. 
 MIKE LAWRENCE: I played well, really. I just didn't -- I drove the ball good, which you have to do. So the bogeys I made, I think I made four or five bogeys in the second round, and they were all iron shots to the greens, you know. So they were unforced errors. 
 And I had a lot of good birdie looks, but I only made one. So I just kind of made the worst out of the round. I felt like I played a lot better than I actually scored out there. And the cut looks like it's three right now, maybe it will go to four. If it does I'll feel a lot better. 

 Q. What about the course?
 MIKE LAWRENCE: It's awesome. 

 Q. The conditions? Were they different?
 MIKE LAWRENCE: Yeah, no, it played about the same. The wet is wet. It's just not -- the bent grass and the water's just not running off anywhere. So it was just as wet today as it was yesterday. Pretty soupy. Soupy.
