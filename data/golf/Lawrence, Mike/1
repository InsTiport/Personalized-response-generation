  Q. Talk about your day if you would.   
 MIKE LAWRENCE: Okay. We started out really bad and after six holes I think I was 6-over. And I just couldn't get untracked.   
 Then I played the last 12 holes 1-under with a double. So finished on a good note. That will make the drive home easier. But it was great. I enjoyed it.  
  
  Q. Talk about your week and making the cut.   
 MIKE LAWRENCE: It was awesome. Yeah, it's always fun, I've been, I played a few of the Majors, you know, so it's just always great. It amazes me how good these guys are, the legends, coming out and watching them play next to them, it's just a great experience.   
 All my buddies at home would love to have a chance to do this. I tell them, you got to practice and work hard and try to get through the national and get into the regular PGA, which I played in a few times too, you know. It's awesome. It's just a great environment.
