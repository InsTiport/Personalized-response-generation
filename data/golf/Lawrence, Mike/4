  Q.  Couple of thoughts on the round.   
 MIKE LAWRENCE:  Yeah, it was awful.  That's a thought.  I started really poor.  On the front side, we played the back side first and I hit a couple of tee shots there.  I was 4-over after five.  And then I kind of hung in there.  I played pretty well for the next section of holes, maybe 10, 12 holes I might have been even par.   
 I picked a couple of wrong clubs out there.  That was frustrating.  I hit a couple of good shots and only to offer shoot the greens.  And I just, it just didn't work.  But that's golf, you know.  That's golf.  You pick the wrong club you pay the consequences.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 MIKE LAWRENCE:  I don't think they were quite as bad.  I don't think they were quite as bad.   
  
  Q.  What are you looking forward to do now?   
 MIKE LAWRENCE:  Well, I'm going to do a couple more.  I'll do some more Champions Tour stuff the rest of this year, yeah.  But it was good to get in.  Get a feel for it.
