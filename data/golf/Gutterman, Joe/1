How was practice today?
JOE GUTTERMAN:  Well, it was better than the last couple days, because I've been hitting it awful.

My son gave me a lesson last night and it got a little bit better.  The weather was great.  We're from Florida so it's just like Florida weather.  It's great.
Q.  Are you feeling pretty confident going into the tournament?
JOE GUTTERMAN:  No, I have no confidence at all.  I'm going to do the best I can.  You don't get that answer very much, do you.
