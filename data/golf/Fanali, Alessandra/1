ALESSANDRA FANALI: Today was really, really good.  I did well.  I'm also happy with the green reading, so it was good.
Q. The greens are pretty tough out there today.  Seems like a pretty big challenge for most of this round for a lot of players.  Was your dad helping you?  What do you attribute that success on the greens today?
ALESSANDRA FANALI: I think today, because the greens are so fast, and some pins, like the last one, are so tricky.  So you have to be focused on the pace and aiming, but yeah, it's hard.
Q. A lot of Sun Devils here this week, senior year, upper class.  Does it help at all knowing you have teammates and friends?
ALESSANDRA FANALI: Yeah, this really helps you, and also because I'm freshman, so this is my first semester here.  To have them here is really special, and there is also my coach here.  So yeah, I'm so happy about it.
Q. Did Missy have any words for you guys?
ALESSANDRA FANALI: Yeah, every day and every morning before starting practice for the round, and she's always so nice.  She can help you a lot.  It's so good.
Q. Have you thought about, yeah, if you keep playing like you are, playing well, you get to tee it up at Augusta National this Saturday, has it hit you yet or have you put off thinking about it?
ALESSANDRA FANALI: I mean, I don't know.  What do you mean?
Q. Are you nervous?  Are you excited?
ALESSANDRA FANALI: I'm a little nervous, but I'm so excited.  So we have a great team, so it will be so fun.  I'm so excited about it.
