 Q.  Can I get your thoughts on a 5-under 67 out there?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: Yeah, I think that was really good.  I start really well but I make a really bad shot on No. 8 in the water and safe a good bogey.  Then make a good putt on No. 9 and after the back nine was really good and my putting was really good, also.  So that's why I shoot 6-under on the last ten holes.   
 Q.  An eagle and a birdie on the last three holes, nice way to finish?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: Exactly.  I hit a good drive on No. 16 and I was just front of the green and I make a really nice putt.  So that helped me a lot, and a nice putt on the last one to finish with a birdie.  So yeah, really good finish.   
 Q.  What were the conditions like out there compared to the last two days?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: Like the wind was there, but not much, so that was okay and the course was really good this morning.  So that was really close than yesterday.  Maybe just more easier because the wind is a little bit less than yesterday.   
 Q.  You're in very strong position going into the final day tomorrow.  You must be really pleased?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: Yeah, I'm really pleased about that.  I know my long game is in really good shape, so that will help me a lot tomorrow.  So I will just do my best and we will see what happens.
