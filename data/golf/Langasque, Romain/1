Q A 68 today, what was the secret to that success?
ROMAIN LANGASQUE:   Is I'm really pleased with the round.  I've got a lot of birdie position and I stayed really patient and I made a few putts.  It was a good round.  I mean, the greens are tough to read because they have a lot of grain, so you have to be really patient, but I think my long game was the key.
Q It's easy to focus on the fact you've played a lovely round of golf today.  But I want to ask you about something last week, you had a different job during these very strange times, as well, away from the course when you couldn't play any golf, you were giving back to the local community.  Tell us about that.
ROMAIN LANGASQUE:   Yeah, it was during the first lockdown in France and we were stuck at home and I was like, okay, let's try to do something good for working guys who are in tough situations.  I decided to buy some meal in the Bubble Caf√© in Juan les Pins, a good friend with me, we work this thing.  For me, it was a tough period because it was closed at this time.
So I buy some meals and then we deliver for one week in a different hospital around the town and I think we just tried to make everybody happy and to give a smile a little bit in this tough period.
Q Having done something like that, does that change your perspective of what golf means in your life?
ROMAIN LANGASQUE:   I mean, I have always been trying to think that there is more important than golf and more important than a bogey.  But I mean, yes, you know, it was tough and now I feel really lucky to be able to play in these kind of conditions here.  I know in Europe, it's tough at the moment and most of the country on locked down.  I try to do my best to enjoy my time over there, and if I can thank all the sponsor and the European Tour for the job they are making, that would be good, because we are really very lucky.
