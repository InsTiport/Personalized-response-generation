Q. Can you talk us through your round?
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: Yeah, it was a really solid round.  I played the game I was looking for.  I played quite fantastic from the tee, but on the second shot I tried to go right of the flag.  My putter was good from the far right.  I made a two-putt from 10 meters a lot of time.  I think that was the best part of my game today.
Q. Did you learn anything about the Royal Portrush course that you can use tomorrow?
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: I think there's going to be a different wind tomorrow.  It's going to be a different course.  I just go shot by shot and just do my best.  Trying to just making sure I'm in the right place.  And that's it.
Q. How do you prepare for tomorrow's round?
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: I think I'm just going to have a rest, have a good gym session, and just focus on tomorrow to get ready.
