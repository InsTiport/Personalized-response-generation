 Q. I know it was really tough conditions out there, what was the biggest challenge for you today?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: I think maybe the greens. The wind was the same as yesterday, but the greens were so firm and so fast. The greens were a big challenge today. I was very unlucky on No. 12  I just play really offensive. Try something, maybe too much. But I just try and it's not working.  
   
 Q. You have one round left. Obviously this has been a great week, a special week for you. Can you just talk about how much fun you've had and how special it was to be here?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: I made the cut, that's most important now. Tomorrow it will be a new day. I will start even par. Just try to enjoy my last day at the Masters. And now more important is that I made the cut  Just learning more and more.  
   
 Q. What's been your favorite part of the week so far?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: The best part of the week? Maybe the first round because I played well and I played with two really good guys. It was really good for me.  
   
 Q. How about staying in the Crow's Nest with the other guys?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: It feels really good, but it is a lot of fun around. That was a good experience. I enjoyed it.  
   
 Q. When will be your first pro tournament?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: Not next week, in two weeks in Egypt.  
   
 Q. Do you have any sort of status or is it just getting invited?  
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: No, I get to go because I play in Kenya and I finished 2nd, so I have the right to play.
