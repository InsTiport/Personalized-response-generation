Q. 68, what is it about your game that's really firing?
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: My game is in a really good way. Today was a bit up-and-down. Just missing two small putts was a bit of mistake on my side, but other than that, the back nine was really strong with my long game and so many shots at the flag, so that was really positive for tomorrow.
Q. We know this is a special event, 103 rd playing of this great tournament. What makes it so special for you as a French man?
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: I mean, it's the only time we are all playing in front of the French crowd, and always special to come back on this course, especially after The Ryder Cup now. Always a pleasure to play on such a beautiful course. Yeah, it's always special. My family will be there on the weekend. It's really nice to play in front of the family. Yeah, just try to enjoy as much as I can and doing my best.
Q. It's a golf course that gets rave reviews, and of course The Ryder Cup now, and you were hearing for The Ryder Cup doing something a little bit different from your normal day job.
ROMAIN LANGASQUE: Yeah, I came as a spectator and on Saturday morning, I ask if I can carry the board and they say you can, so I just carried the board for the foursome, Tiger Woods against Fleetwood and Molinari, so it was quite a strong match.
It was my only opportunity to get in the ropes, so I just enjoy as much as I can, and it was good to see, also, from this side of the rope, and to see the public. It was really good and I think can help me one day playing on this team.
