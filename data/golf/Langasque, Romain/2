  Q. First event of The European Tour, 5-under par, you must be delighted.
 ROMAIN LANGASQUE:   Yeah, it was a really good start today.  I played not my best golf game in the round, and that was really cool because not that easy when you didn't play since like three months in a tournament and starting beginning in Abu Dhabi but I feel really good today.
 Q. How have you been spending your time in the off-season?
 ROMAIN LANGASQUE:   I go back home in Andorra for a few days to reset because after the quarantine it was much needed.  But then I start practising and I went to Dubai really early to be in the best condition with my coach to practice again, and I mean, I feel great, so it was a good idea.
 Q. Last season, broke through with a win.  What do you think is a good season for you this year?  What's your goals and ambitions now?
 ROMAIN LANGASQUE:   I mean, now I know that I am ready for more, so I am looking for the Top-50 in the world and something like that but then it's going to be also to prepare myself in every tournament and maybe to play a little bit -- but every time I play to do the best I can.
 Q. Kicking off the season with the field, 5-under right in the mix, exciting few days ahead for you?
 ROMAIN LANGASQUE:   Yeah, it's exciting.  Already exciting to play 5-under even more in these kind of events, but it's a tournament round, and there is all the year in front of us, so I will do the best I can.
