   NICK DOUGHERTY: Well, I think my score yesterday was probably a little bitter than the one today. We've had some great weather obviously this afternoon for us. You've got to try and capitalise on that.   
 I didn't hit the ball quite as well as I would like to tee-to-green. I didn't hit it brilliant yesterday, but I hit it a bit better than today. Unfortunately I wasn't really hitting it close enough to use the front nine. Putting really well still. So in that sense a little disappointing.   
 So of course I shot 5-under, that's great, happy, another good solid day. So yeah, very happy.  
  
  Q. Weather-wise you really have struck it lucky, haven't you?   
 NICK DOUGHERTY: I think so. We had the tougher condition yesterday you can see with the scoring. However, I think it's still balanced in our favour because it's significantly easier this afternoon. Apparently I was still in bed when the guys were struggling this morning. I don't know how quite how bad it was but certainly it wasn't raining, and obviously now it's perfect, so yeah, very happy with my side of the draw.   
  
  Q. That's a nice lie-in, isn't it?   
 NICK DOUGHERTY: No, apparently not. Apparently the weather is going to be so bad tomorrow, they are trying to get us up early. So as I say, the best I've played in about a year and I'm still getting up early, same tee times.  
 But it doesn't matter. I'm looking forward to it. Two good days of work, and looking forward to getting out there and enjoying the weekend.
