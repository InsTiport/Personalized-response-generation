  Q. Henrik just pulled it out on the last couple of holes.   
 NICK DOUGHERTY: Yeah, he did, he made two great birdies on the last two holes, but I feel like we deserved to win that match. I feel like we played the better golf and we had our chances to finish it off there at the end just before those last two holes, so it's our own fault.   
 At the same time, you know, it's disappointing when you're through with three to play, and all credit to Henrik, wonderful birdies, particularly the one on 18, fantastic. Yeah, good match.  
  
  Q. Overall, great day for yourself.   
 NICK DOUGHERTY: Yeah, it's all right. You've just caught me literally within a minute of me losing a 3-up lead, so I'm not particularly happy right now to be honest.   
 But overall when you think about it was a good day's work. We got a lot of red on the board ands a team it's really important that we keep getting this ready and we are doing that at the moment. So hopefully the guys at the back can finish this off for us.  
  
  Q. Your partnership worked with Steve worked well.   
 NICK DOUGHERTY: It did work well. I'm not playing well this week. I didn't hit the quality shots I would have liked to have hit down the stretch, but we played well to be fair. We were under par, so you can't do much more than that. In foursomes play, that's not bad golf.
