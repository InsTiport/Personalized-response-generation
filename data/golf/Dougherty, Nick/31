   NICK DOUGHERTY:  I thought yesterday the course was harder than the scores were suggesting,  so to shoot four under on a day when it is really blows was very rewarding. I made a big move up the board. I feel I am playing well, making a pot of progress. I am a little disappointed not to have won a tournament. I have had plenty of chances, led ten events this year. That is holding me back a little but overall I am making very solid progress and if I keep playing good golf it will be just around the corner and try and get in the winners' circle again. I have just had a bad break here and there, a few things to iron out.   
 It is a tough day and I putted well. The end of the front nine stretch is brutal, and I am pleased to have come through that. It is so difficult.   
  
  Q.  Does not getting the win get frustrating?   
 NICK DOUGHERTY:  It gets extremely frustrating but at the same time you have to back away and think eventually it will come. Getting angry will not help but sometimes at the end of the tournament when you have had an opportunity to won you do get demorilised, but you come back the next day. It's what we do for a job and you have to get on with it.
