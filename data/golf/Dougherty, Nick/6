 Q. Not the best way to finish?
 NICK DOUGHERTY: No it wasn't good today. It was a disappointing week to be honest and I felt I played a lot better than my scores suggest. Yesterday was a good example of that, I was two under playing the 16th and I should have been five under the way I was playing and I finished double, par, bogey to shoot one over. But I did play poorly today.

 Q. Thoughts for next week?
 NICK DOUGHERTY: Well, today aside, there has been some good stuff in there for me this week on a course that I have never really scored any good on before so that is one of the positives for me. It is sad that the last day is the one you remember the most. It is hard to pick the positives at the moment because I feel a bit pig sick to be honest but when I reflect on it tomorrow, I'm sure there will be some.
