Q.  General assessment?
NICK DOUGHERTY:  Yeah, I'm really pleased with the score because I'm not playing great at the moment.  I'm fighting a bit with my swing, and I made a bogey on 18, hit it left off the tee.

All in all, some good scrambling, some solid putting, making the ones you're supposed to make.  Putting has been my strength, and if my game does come in order I can work it out, but hopefully I'll contend.
Q.  You had a bogey to start and a bogey to end and everything else in between looked pretty good.
NICK DOUGHERTY:  Yeah, the front nine was a struggle and then I was off to a great start on the back, three in a row.  The putt on 11, that was about 12 feet.  I missed a couple chances at 15, 16 I thought I made it, then birdied 17.  So it was a smelly way to finish a round, bogeying the last, no one likes doing it, but if I'm really honest, I think 3 under is a really good score considering the golf today.
Q.  Can we go through your
NICK DOUGHERTY:  1, I hit it right off the tee.  Then I cut the tree on the way out, missed a putt from about six feet for par.

3, hit wedge to about five feet, made it.

4, hit it on the front edge, three putted.

8, I hit sand iron to about four feet, made it.

10, hit it to about five feet, made it with a pitching wedge.

Hit 9 iron to about 12 feet on 11.

Then I had about a foot and a half on 12.
Q.  What did you hit?
NICK DOUGHERTY:  7 iron.

Missed some chances, and on 17 I hit 9 iron to about four feet, five feet, made it.

Then 18, hit it in the trees, took the chip outside, hit an average sand iron in and two putted but I left my putt short.
