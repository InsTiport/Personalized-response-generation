   NICK DOUGHERTY:  I felt a little bit more pressure than normal. It was great for us to beat these two. They have a lot of experience and are hard to beat. We did really well and Graeme putted absolutely awesome. He holed everything he looked at. Great day.   
 It's great having Nick as captain. There's pressure because I know whatever I do Nick would have done it better in his prime, but it's fantastic to have him there. It gives me a real buzz and I know him really well. But it's great to have one of the world's greatest behind you. He's a good waiter too! He brought me a nice latte round at the ninth and that just did the trick!
