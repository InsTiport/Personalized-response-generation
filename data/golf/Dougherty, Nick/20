  Q. Thoughts on the day?  
 NICK DOUGHERTY: Well, I don't know really, I think I'm happy. I think the eagle at the last certainly brightened it up somewhat. To think I only shot one shot worse yesterday and the way I played, the consistency I showed yesterday and the quality I played, that's golf I suppose.  
 At same time, it was disappointing to make some of the errors I did on the back nine. I made no pars, but at the same time to finish birdie eagle to lift myself back up the field is great and that's the kind of characteristics I would expect to show.  
  
  Q. And that was something in the amphitheatre, as well?  
 NICK DOUGHERTY: I enjoyed. It if I said I didn't enjoy the walk up, I would be lying. It was great fun and I really enjoyed it. It's been a great week and I enjoyed the golf and this would actually be the first time you need to get your brelly out all week.  
  
  Q. The scores that the leaders shot, to find that you're up there in third, but a distance away?  
 NICK DOUGHERTY: To be fair to Scott, that's a phenomenal round. I presume he's going to win obviously unless he falls to pieces in the end, and I think he'll finish it off. To be in the lead and he has not won out here before, and to shoot 7-under on the last day, all credit to him, that's a fantastic effort.  
  
  Q. U.S. Open on your mind?  
 NICK DOUGHERTY: Yeah, absolutely, got to prepare for it. Have a look at what happened this week, where it could have been improved and hopefully move on from here.  
  
  Q. I gather you are not moving on from here immediately, and you have some things to do in Wales?  
 NICK DOUGHERTY: I have a Tommy Hilfiger day tomorrow and a Tommy Hilfiger shoot on Tuesday and going up to the Grove for a Nokia day the day after, so a busy, busy boy at the moment.
