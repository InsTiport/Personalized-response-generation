  NICK DOUGHERTY: The back I played fabulous. Soren is playing awesome at the moment and I knew I had to play my best to beat him today.   

 NICK DOUGHERTY: It's been absolutely fantastic. Nick has been a really great captain. It's match-play experience for the Ryder Cup. It's a great tournament and I was disappointed to read and hear some of the comments made about it. It deserves more credit than that because the 20 players here know how to play. Soren could have wiped the floor with me if I hadn't played well. Match play is my thing. I loved it as an amateur and enjoyed coming back in matches and we don't get the chance to do this very often.   
 This serves a huge purpose for both the captain and for those of us who haven't been in a Ryder Cup before. The bit for Nick's great, getting to know the guys if they make the team, but just for the practice for us. The likes of Phil Archer, Simon Dyson and Graeme Storm would never have been this in the professional game and if they make the team, you don't really want their first shot in match play as a professional in the Ryder Cup. So it's great preparation. A lot of credit has to be given to the guys who run the tournament despite the lack of fans until today. It was better yesterday but they made up for it at the weekend and it's been a great event.
