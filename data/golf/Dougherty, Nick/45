NICK DOUGHERTY:  Nice to make eagle there (18th) twice this week. I hit a three iron today and a four iron on Thursday and make a nice putt today from about 15 feet. I was very pleased with that. It's disappointing in many ways because I was in such great position after two rounds and if you had said to me I was only going to play the weekend in two under I'm not sure I would have taken it on the first tee yesterday.

Having said that, I battled really hard yesterday and was proud of the way I hung in there and show more course maturity and I was very pleased just to get round in 73. There is work still to be done. My swing is work in progress and it's costing me, otherwise I might have won more than once if I had more consistency over four days. I keep throwing in patches where I swing the club badly and I swung it badly for 18 holes yesterday.

You can't win in fields like this playing badly. Too much quality -- people like Tiger and the way David's playing. They are not going to let you in playing like that. Today I stuck at it and hit the ball a lot better and couldn't get the ball in the hole.

I think David will do it although you never know on this course. He deserves it. He's played fantastic golf and I think it bodes really well for England's World Cup defence in Portugal next week.
