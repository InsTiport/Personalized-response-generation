   NICK DOUGHERTY: I struggled a little when the rain came on the back nine but Justin saved my bacon on the 16th by chipping in after we'd been struggling. Obviously I hit a nice shot on to 17 and they bogeyed. It was good to get that first point of the afternoon and it was nice to pull it off at the end.
