DONALD TRUMP:   Fantastic turnout, fantastic galleries, a fantastic winner, really couldn't do any better. 

Q.   And how do you think the course, the conditions were? 
DONALD TRUMP:   Couldn't do any better.   I think the course‑‑ well, it's a tough course.   It's a big, bold course, but it was fair.   But we couldn't ask for anything more.   It was great.
