Q.  Donald, this is your first time at the American Century Championship and you really seemed to enjoy yourself.
DONALD TRUMP:   I really did.  It was really fun.  Played okay, but that last shank, I think you put it on television, the shank.
Q.  Are we fired?
DONALD TRUMP:   No, you're not fired.  I'm fired for hitting it.
ROGER MALTBIE:   I said earlier in the show I would think five or six straight days of golf is more than you ever get a chance to do.
DONALD TRUMP:   It's a lot.  I think it's a record for me.  I've played five days in a row.  I've never played that much golf, but you get better.  But at a certain point, you are looking forward to going back to the real estate business.  And a lot of these guys are really good players.
ROGER MALTBIE:  The quality of golf, were you surprised at how good the players are?  I know you've played in so many Pro Ams and you've played with a lot of professionals, but how about the quality of play?
DONALD TRUMP:   Well, not only good, they are very long hitters.  They are Tour length, even longer probably than many of the people on the Tour and you have some great athletes.  They are all great athletes, very, very good golfers.  I was surprised at the level, the level is very, very high, and the tournament was really well handled.
ROGER MALTBIE:  What about the quality of the golf course here.  As well.
DONALD TRUMP:   Excellent, just the whole Lake Tahoe experience has been great.  I have enjoyed it.  Five days is a lot of golf, but I'll be on the course on Saturday probably.
ROGER MALTBIE:  You've added a lot to the event.
DONALD TRUMP:   Thank you.  I had a lot of fun.
Q.  Congratulations on your four Emmy nominations for The Apprentice.
DONALD TRUMP:   Yeah, we got a lot of Emmy nominations.  It's a great show and I hope you're going to be watching come September, maybe we can pick up an Emmy, that will be good.
