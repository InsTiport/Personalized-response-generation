Q.   Tell me a little bit about your round today and going into the weekend. 
STEVE PATE:   I played decent, I didn't hit it as well as I did yesterday.   I putted a little better.   I need to go work on a couple things and straighten out my ball striking. 
But I hit it really well yesterday, I putted well today and it's amazing what it would get me if I did both on the same day. 

Q.   The conditions were a little easier today?
STEVE PATE:   Yeah, they were easier today. 

Q.   The greens were easier?
STEVE PATE:   No, they're still impossible.   But, yeah, it wasn't blowing 25 miles an hour.
