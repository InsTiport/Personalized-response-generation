JOHN HUSTON:  I had a great week.  That was pretty close to the best golf I played all week.  I think I was 5- or 6-under in the first round against Bob Estes, but I played really well today and made seven birdies.  The only hiccup was on No. 3 when I 3-putted; otherwise, I putted it extremely well.  But the main thing was that I drove the ball in the fairway today.  That was the difference between this match and the semifinal.  I made a really fast start with a 15-footer at the 1st for birdie, but I think key was at No. 4.  Steve holed a 50-footer right across the green, and I holed from 20 feet for a birdie, as well, right on top of him.  That was a big one.  I enjoyed the format this week, and I hope the fans receive it well.  Maybe some of them were disappointed that Tiger and David (Duval) didn't get much further, but it's great to see a really close final today.  The Match Play event is something different, and I've had great fun.  I'll definitely be back next year.
 
 

STEVE PATE:  John played very well, and it's pretty self-explanatory what happened.  He made seven birdies in 14 holes.  I think that tells you everything.  I didn't play too badly, but it was disappointing to bogey the last two holes we played. He was definitely in control all day.  I love this Match Play and would like to see some more on the TOUR.  I think the players will soon get used to it.  I'll be back at La Costa next year trying to go one better.
