 Q.   Great comeback.   
STEVE PATE:   Yeah, I played pretty well all day.   I hit it in the bottom of a bunker and it looked like it was in the bottom of a bomb pit.   I thought I missed it in the place you should miss it.   
   
 Q.   There's a lot of pitfalls on this golf course.   
STEVE PATE:   Yeah, there are.   You can't avoid them all.   
   
 Q.   You're unofficially coming in as the leader in the clubhouse.   To somebody that just doesn't even have any concept of it all, you learned it on the fly.   So that's what it's all about?  
STEVE PATE:   Right.   It's so severe and there's so many slopes I don't think you can learn it in a year.   You're guessing ‑‑ you're always guessing.   And then you get used to playing up and over after awhile.   
   
 Q.   You officially have the best score turned in on the golf course.   
STEVE PATE:   At least temporarily.  
   
 Q.   And through the rest of the tournament it's just be patient as far as you know from what you've seen so far?  
STEVE PATE:   Yeah, I mean patience is not my style, but that's what you have to do.
