 Q.   Talk about the round and the day.   
STEVE PATE:   I got off to a little bit of a slow start, I was hitting it kind of not very good.   That's a socially acceptable term.   
I made a bogey, made a birdie, and then kind of got my act together somewhere midway through the front side, hit it well the rest of the day, and made some putts.   Didn't really hit any loose shots, I putted pretty well.   Really no complaints.   
It's funny, I'm playing a golf ball this week I never played before.   It's a new Callaway ball that they said is better in the wind and it performed as advertised.  
   
 Q.   Wind from a little bit different direction, did the course play much different than the previous days?  
STEVE PATE:   I don't have any feel for this course at all.   I got here, I played 12 holes Tuesday, played on Wednesday, so it's, every day is like the first day out here for me.   It doesn't really matter to me which way the wind blows.   
   
 Q.   Highlights of the round maybe.   Go through that.   Any good saves or long putts for birdies?  
STEVE PATE:   Yeah, I made a 15 and 16 were good.   14, 15, 16.   
14, I hit it in the fairway not very far and I had 200 yards basically and hit it about three or four feet and made it.   
15, I drove it in the right rough, it kicked into the, not in the hazard, but in the weeds, chopped it out and had 6â€‘iron in for my third shot and made five.   Which was good.
