STEVE PATE:  Jeff made some birdies coming in.  I didn't do anything to counter.  I hit a bad second shot on 18.  13 was the turning point.  I was in between clubs, 115 yards, I buried buried in the bunker.  The wind got still.  It was a sand wedge. I played aggressively.  Didn't know what else to.  He is not going to make bogeys.  Would much rather be playing tomorrow. 
 
I won four matches.  Would have like today have won two more.  Didn't do a very good job reading the greens.  Oh, well. 
 
I enjoy doing this.  Can't think of anything else I'd rather do.  It was stimulating.  I really enjoy doing this.
