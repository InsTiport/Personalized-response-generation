STEVE PATE:  3-wood, 6-iron to about four feet made it. 
 
STEVE PATE:  I can't remember the holes on this golf course.  Made bogey and birdie on the back.  15, 3-wood down the middle, 6-iron short of the green pitched it up ten feet and missed.  Birdied No. 1 driver, 2-iron, 35 feet and 2-putted.  Birdied No. 9, driver, 8-iron about 20 feet and made it. 
 
DAVE SENKO:  Birdie for you on No. 7 too which would be the 16th hole. 
 
STEVE PATE:  Wait a minute.  Maybe you are right.  Hole 16.  I can't remember this golf course.  Yeah, you are right, I am trying to think of the hole. 
 
STEVE PATE:  Every hole out here looks the same.  I can't remember. 
 

Q.  Dave, how did you play today?
 
STEVE PATE:  Not particularly well.  Didn't hit very well and didn't make any putts.  All and all about as good as I could have gotten out of it. 
 

Q.  In this kind of tournament how many shots out is too far out?  Who is still in?
 
STEVE PATE:  I don't know.  I try not to think about it (laughs).  I have never really considered it.  Just trying to make birdies. 
 

Q.  Putting yourself in a position to win, is that what this is really all about, just kind of being there for tomorrow?
 
STEVE PATE:  Pretty much.  What is leading right now? 
 

Q.  Steve, you have played in this tournament many years being a Southern California guy does this have any special meaning for you to try to win this tournament over others?
 
STEVE PATE:  Not really.  I have never played well here. Doesn't really have anymore meaning than anything else.  The only thing that means something to me is San Diego because I have won there already and only because I live there.
