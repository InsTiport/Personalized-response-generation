 Q.   Tell me about your round today.   
STEVE PATE:   I putted well today.   It's the most putts I made in a round all year.   I made four 20 footers and a bomb on the last hole.   
I hit a lot of greens, I didn't hit it close, and I made some putts.   So all in all worked out pretty well.   
   
 Q.   I know you made a big birdie on 18.   Could you tell me specifically about that hole?  
STEVE PATE:   I hit a really good drive, hit what I thought was a pretty good 7‑iron, landed up about 10 feet from the hole and ended up about 45 feet away, almost in the grand stands.   And I made it.   
   
 Q.   How did the rain delay affect you and how did the course kind of hold up after it?  
STEVE PATE:   The course held up fine.   The fairways have been soft, we don't need the rain.   They held up fine.   
I was on a pretty good roll when we went in and then I came out and bogeyed two of my first three holes.   So I wasn't real pleased about that, but I made two birdies late, so it was, all in all, it was a good day.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel heading into the final round after moving into the top‑10 today?  
STEVE PATE:   Pretty well.   I feel pretty good.   I've played decent all week.   I've driven it well, I hit a lot of fairways, which you have to do out here.   If I can keep doing that, slop in a few putts, things are good.
