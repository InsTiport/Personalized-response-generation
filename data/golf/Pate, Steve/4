Q.   Talk about your round today. 
STEVE PATE:   I played well.   I did everything pretty well.   Drove it decent, hit my irons decent, putted decent.   Nothing was outstanding, but I didn't really make any mistakes.

Q.   Anything different in the course from Thursday to Friday?
STEVE PATE:   It's starting to dry up a little bit.   There's not as much mud on ball in the fairway.   It's rolling a little bit. 
The greens are getting a little firmer, a little faster. 

Q.   On to the weekend, what are your thoughts going into Saturday and Sunday?
STEVE PATE:   I better drive it well.   It's really important out here.
