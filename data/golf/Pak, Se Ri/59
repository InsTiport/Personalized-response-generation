Q.   Great round, 69.  You're sort of starting where you left off in majors.  There's something about this that just turns you on, isn't there?
 SE RI PAK:  Actually before I came to this week I felt already great.  I said earlier I talked to you, I struck the ball really well.  And I feel so much comfortable at the golf course, and so much confidence in myself.  It doesn't matter I played good or bad, it feels really good to come back.

All day I just had such a solid round all day long.  It didn't give me any trouble out there, it was so much wet, your ball is not going anywhere.  Today is a great round today.  It was pretty much comfortable round today.  So I really enjoyed it.
Q.  It was a really good finish, because you birdied the 6th hole, a very long par 4?
 SE RI PAK:  I think golfers    you never expecting some from anywhere, that make you have to    there's 16, which is not easy from there.  I got a perfect read.  I just hope I'm going to make a good two putt there.  That was another bonus hole, which just helps me out.  It helps me out after that, and I still feel so much confidence in myself and it feels great.
Q.  Nice to get on the course after waiting around all day yesterday?
 SE RI PAK:  Oh, yeah, it was.  Finally you go out today and I feel really great.  Like I said, such great weather today.  The morning is a lot easier than the afternoon.  But tomorrow I'm going off in the afternoon.  But hopefully I've got a great day tomorrow, too.
