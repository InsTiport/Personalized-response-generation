  Q. I wanted to ask you about scoring conditions today. The scoring, the conditions were very good I would say.   
 SE RI PAK: Well, this golf course isn't easy at all because the rough is so long, and the fairways, sometimes you have to lay up or pull short irons. There's a lot of big undulation greens, and it's pretty hard to get up-and-down. As long as you're in the fairway, it's okay, but I mean, basically this golf course is not even easy like that. But I'm really happy with my round.  
  
  Q. What was it that helped you get to 4-under par given that the rough was long and the greens were big and they had all these undulations? What were you particularly happy with?  
 SE RI PAK: Basically I wasn't missing too much, and at the same time I got a couple up-and-downs. But basically I wasn't missing too much fairways. I was in the fairway, on the green, two-putt and basically try not to make a big number.   
 The greens the last few days have been really slow. Today was totally different speed. Actually that's getting a little harder, but I like the fast greens. The last three days was really hard for me to speed up. I was making a lot better putts today.   
  
  Q. The last question I have is you had a front row seat to watch Lorena put on something of a very good clinic. She hit 17 greens. What do you have to say about how she played today?  
 SE RI PAK: Well, she's been great for like the last two or three years. She knows her game well, and she's such a good player, a controlled player. Everything is consistent with the way she plays. She hits long. Actually her putting and short game is really good. Today I don't think she missed any greens. She made a couple putts that, still, it's pretty good she's right there. I guess that's why she's the top player.
