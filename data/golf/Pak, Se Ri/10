Q.   Se Ri, take us through your round today? 
SE RI PAK:   It was a really good start actually on the front nine.   Still the same the last three days had really solid shot on each hole and I had a lot of confidence.   It was really fun today.   A lot of gallery out there and a lot of fans out cheering me.   I played with a young, super strong players.   It was a good experience, really fun to watch her play.   At the same time it gave me a great tempo at the same time too.   It was good.   Just there is nothing to complain about it.   Of course I mis‑hit it there a little bit, but that will happen on this golf course.   So we're still good finishes heading into the last round.   I think I'm in pretty good shape.

Q.   You mentioned being in pretty good shape.   You're still in the Hunt, only two back.   What is your approach going into tomorrow? 
SE RI PAK:   Probably same as last three days.   Try to play smart.   Trying to not make any big number of errors.   At the same time, trying not to have trouble shots out there.   So just keep it at the same tempo as the last three days.   Just hole to hole, shot to shot, try to focus as much as I could, and hopefully I'll play 18.   At the end of the round I'll have a big smile.

Q.   You're a major champion in the past.   How do you think that experience of having a couple majors under your belt will help you going into tomorrow? 
SE RI PAK:   It should give me a lot of confidence, no doubt, because you're there before, which is that just helps you with great experience and playing heading into Sunday.   If you're 2‑back or you're leading, just it's probably as much as I could handle the pressures and just focus as much as I could.   Yeah, that makes it helpful heading into Sunday, no doubt.
