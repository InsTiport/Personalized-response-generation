 Q. Cristie is obviously playing pretty well. She's at 18. 
 SE RI PAK: 18-under? She was 20, right? 

 Q. She just doubled. 
 SE RI PAK: Oh, okay.

 Q. Do you think she's gonna come back tomorrow, or do you think you can run her down?
 SE RI PAK: Well, for one she got such a solid round for first three rounds. So no doubt about it. She was there before many times. Of course she can stay there. 
 Just be really hard for tomorrow. Go low might have a chance, but... 

 Q. How low do you think you have to go tomorrow?
 SE RI PAK: As low as possible. (Laughing.) It's pretty hard to say, but, yeah, I mean, as I say, you can go low here. It's going to be one bounce going cause -- you know, make a different situation. 
 Maybe I should go at least 7 or 8-under and she stay maybe 1 or 2-under. I mean, I don't know. Depends on what's going to be tomorrow.
 But as I said, definitely she's going to be stay up there. There's no doubt about it. But I guess I'm the really one move forward as much as I can.

 Q. Just make a whole a lot of birdies. 
 SE RI PAK: Right, yeah.
