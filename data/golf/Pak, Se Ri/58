Q.  You showed a lot of courage coming into that last 18 holes.  What resources did you use?
 SE RI PAK:  I think I probably woke up in the afternoon, I guess.  I was just stroking really good.  Putting a little mis hit and there, because the winds actually kind of bothers me a little much earlier.

But in the afternoon I was trying to play a lot more aggressively.  I'm always telling my caddie, last round, either way you win or lose, I don't think I have in between, though.  So I'm trying to play as aggressive as I can.  So I should do it earlier.
Q.  Did you notice Annika pulling away?
 SE RI PAK:  No, actually I saw some scores, but she's pretty consistent.  I don't think that it was big difference, even the last 18.  I know she was going to hang in there well, and I need to play well, and I just go out and do my best and play really well.  But she's still good enough out there.

But I'm really glad to see she play well again.
Q.  What was the difference between your afternoon round?  You had four birdies and 69.  In the morning round you had 74.
 SE RI PAK:  I think I hit a lot more solid my irons.  I mean, I'm not complaining at all, but my irons were a little off early in the morning.  But in the afternoon seems like I was stroking a lot better, and I see a lot better alignment and seems like better calculating in between my shots, so it just helps a lot.
