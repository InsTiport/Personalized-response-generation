 Q. Your scorecard?
 SE RI PAK'S CADDIE: Chipped it in from the bottom around there, blocked it right and just trying to hit it on the front. 152 front, 177 back edge. Hit it down there in front and chipped it in. It was nice. 
 11, we hit 154, 80, holed, hit 6-iron down there about 12 feet in the hole. Two signatures, hit it about 12 feet under the hole, canned it. Didn't get it up-and-down on 14, and made bogey, and then birdied 18.
