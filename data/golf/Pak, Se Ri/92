SE RI PAK:  Thank you. 
 
SE RI PAK:  Well, I started pretty good on first hole. Make eagle.  Two on and one putt feels really great for a start. And right before I tee off.  Me and my caddy just say, nothing to lose today, I mean this is the last round, last day.  I don't have any chance any more.  So we just have some fun out there and just go for it.  Trying to as strong as I can and somehow it happens, happens, trying to win.  Anyway, I'm here for the win.  So nothing to lose.  I'm not going to be in second place and unhappy about it. So me and caddy just talked about, well we just go for it and play. And after 14, I was on 14 I just already saw the scoreboard and then I was in the top of the leaderboard.  Then I was in good shape.  So I just, after that, I was trying to play more aggressive as I can. And then after 18 and, well, here I am.  I got a trophy. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  It did surprise me.  And I was, I think before I finished ninth.  I saw the scoreboard.  And everybody just like, 10, 11, 10 was like four people.  And I don't have much chance to catch up because I don't have much holes to go and they have a great many holes left.  So I just thinking, just keep playing and trying to best finish as I can.  And then after 14 I saw that and they just, everybody dropped to eight or nine.  So I on the top of the leaderboard.  Kind of a big surprise to me. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  What did I say to my caddy?  For? 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  We didn't talk about much.  He saw it, I saw it.  And still I have the most difficult golf holes left.  Like the last three holes.  And I was thinking, okay, just to just be a good finish.  And my caddy just go, whatever happens, happens, just try to be a good play and smart play on last few holes.  And pretty much we're in good shape.  And then after that we just played and just played.  And then we got to 18. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  I think it helps me a lot too.  He is from England and he knows the golf game.  The golf game is different than U. S. I have always spin a lot, make it spin a lot in greens and close to pin of course is much easier.  But this country golf greens totally different than U. S., I mean I have to be 20 yards, 30 yards short to the green and bump and run the green.  Hopefully get bounce.  Hopefully goes close to hole and make some birdie. Whatever.  If not, it's fine.  I mean, it's just totally different. I don't have any idea how to play this kind of golf game.  But he knew, at the same time, he knew the course and just whatever he just, you know, he decided 10 yards short to the green or whatever, 20 short to green or using like short club as I can and keep it in the fairway if I can and kind of using a lot of communicating with each other and I think it's helping a lot for this week. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  Much better than 1998.  After 1998 I just said I can't come back any more because it was so hard.  I mean the raining whole week, wind so bad and course is not right.  So I was thinking, I couldn't play this kind of golf.  And then after that Colin said, England golf is fun.  I said no, it's not fun.  It's a stress for me.  Then he said, this course is really good.  Then I  said okay.  There is no choice for me, this is like our last major the year.  And I say okay.  I tried and I come here and practice round it was just fun.  Actually it was fun to play.  And then Tuesday I was out there practice and I said, this is fun.  This is kind of different, but it's fun.  But I learn more about a different golf game.  So I was really excited to play. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  I think I would come anyway because of the major.  But he was helping a lot for the, to play, how to play golf here, the condition of the course. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  Majors always different I feel, yeah.  I feel this was a major.  Yeah. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  Starting last three, somehow my drive was kind of a little, it doesn't feel comfortable at all.  Especially today. On 16 I was hooking my driver left today.  Left of what many people are there.  And probably if I didn't, maybe I hit someone, I guess. But I -- right.  Whatever.  Right.  But that gives a lot of good bounce to the right.  That helped me a lot after that.  I was thinking, oh, my God, this is it.  After that maybe I don't have any chance any more.  This is it.  Then I just said, okay, no matter what happens just trying to play.  But I saw that my ball is almost in the fairway.  Then I said, well, what a lucky bounce.  Probably my day.  So then after few holes I play because good play because I was pretty happy for the 16th. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  I feel great.  Especially our country, we don't have much good conditions to play golf actually.  I was young.  Not many course there before.  But now it's getting bigger and bigger.  And at the same time it's just so hard to play because so many play golf, so many play golf then we don't have any time to make a tee time to go out and play.  We always practice around like little small more place range.  We don't have any like good condition like in U. S..  And we, after first year doing well in all the many Korean younger players coming around and trying the LPGA, then they play well and especially this week.  She is a North Korean player.  That really makes me feel a lot too.  It looks like our country get much bigger and better.  Especially in the golf now it's much huger and everybody is just changing their mind and trying to make more helping for little child, children, play golf.  It's fun a lot.  So I think that it's pretty good things could happen. 
 
Q.  Do you know how many courses there are in Korea or how many ladies are playing there?
 
SE RI PAK:  No, I don't know.  I got no idea.  I mean before I was thinking like 130, it was like three years ago, but now just a lot of keep making, making, so I don't even know exactly. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  Right.  Well, I for sure, 1998, I mean I was first time in England for first year.  And after I played in, of course I want to win the tournament somehow, some reason, I don't know why.  But I played so bad.  And at the same time just kind of everything is for me is really hard time that moment.  So I don't want to come back because I don't know.  But now this tournament is a major, so I was thinking, this is going to be the one to be have the major for my collection, actually.  Yeah, it was.  And well, I just, I just really didn't expect this week.  So many good players on the top.  And I just kind of a little slow play.  And I wasn't doing well this week.  But right now I'm the last person talking in the media center, got a trophy.  That is like huge difference.  
 
SE RI PAK:  Well, first day I think almost like two, two rounds kind of pretty much was in the rain.  So first round, around 12, 13 holes of rain.  And second, third round, yesterday, around like four or five holes in the rain.  So pretty much like one, one and a half, yeah.  I think. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  I don't think so.  They already know me a lot in the first year.  And now they pretty much used to it.  And at the same time well, they just somehow pretty sure I'm going to win soon again.  So I just, I don't think it's nothing is going to make big difference before than right now. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  I think for last year some how time to, I think time to little more growing up, I guess.  First 1998, 1999 was my pretty much first year.  And I was really, really good, play well.  And this surprised me at the same time.  Then after that the first two years so busy, I don't even know what happened.  I don't know what is going on.  And I just played and played.  And I just never think much about the, I never think about everything around what's happening.  Then 2000 starting for January, I didn't play well and I'm getting every week is same thing.  Didn't improve, looks like I never change and stuff.  And after that it gives me a lot of stress.  Everything is like so stressed.  And it was just getting mad, upset more than first two years because I have a great two years.  Then I don't know why, just everything says, why, what happened?  And I just kept thinking and thinking.  And after like September I realized that I think just the way, perfect time to tell me to learn about more lessons in my game, mentally and physically to give me time to growing up a little more better than first two years.  Then I just after September I changed my mind, okay, just trying to get ready for the 2001 new season.  And just make myself more comfortable at the rest of the year.  And trying to change my swing a little bit.  And get some new putter and whatever.  You know, just have some, improve more than like right now.  So after that 2001 just starting to be really great.  Just the way the plan is.  But everything is pretty perfect to plan it. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  Right.  That's exactly that important moment is the 2001, the 2000, I guess.  Like mentally how to play, an I learn more about the Tour and everything.  So this is why I play much better than.  Right now is much better than last three years ago. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  Yes.  Yeah.  He knows.  I just started.  So I just don't know. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  Yes, I am. 
 
Q.  Next year, how many tournaments do you think you can win next year?
 
SE RI PAK:  I can't guarantee, but it looks like as soon as I get, my game is much getting stronger and more, let's say, like it's much like -- the last first three years I have a kind of, I can't even trust much in the course in myself.  But now I trust a lot and it feels great and I feel strong.  Now I've just really enjoyed to play.  So next year I can't guarantee.  Hopefully every year four or five is enough to win, I guess. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  The course?  
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  They're going to change it? 
 
SE RI PAK:  I don't know.  I guess actually I got no idea.  Hopefully, this is a great course at the same time.  So I, whatever it takes, I going to take it.  So I just don't even expect any more than right now. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  No. 
 
Q.  Are you engaged to be married?
 
SE RI PAK:  No.  Because always I didn't wear much ring. But I always wear on the right side.  So I have to shake on the hand.  So kind of the pain.  So I just switched it.  Not yet.  I still young.  Hopefully some time, some day. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SE RI PAK:  Right.  First two years I was really, I think, very looking very tight.  I always I think I never, I always thing I never push myself.  But I was pushing a lot especially last year. And now I just feels like much enjoyed it outside.  And always I want to be.  But it's always never happened before.  But now it's much enjoy it.  I play and it's fun.  This is the way I wanted it before but just never first two years.  I don't know why, but doing so well.  And I really think I can do better than that.  So I just keep pushing and pushing.  But now I just know that I knew that I can do it better than that.  So I just kind of say, okay, just play well.  Just have some fun outside.  And just do my best.  And just going to be happy, you know? 
 
Q.  What is your idea of fun when you're not playing golf?
 
SE RI PAK:  I didn't do much at all.  I always practice, more practice.  Come home, watching TV.  Or watch movies sometimes. And it's always just be at home.  I don't want to move at all.  I just stay home, walk around or play with my dog and that's all. Nothing special going around. 
 
SE RI PAK:  Thank you. 
 
SE RI PAK:  Thank you.  Thank you.
