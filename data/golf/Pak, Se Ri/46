 Q.  Talk a little about your round. 
 SE RI PAK:  Well, actually, it was pretty calm day though.  Not really going good or bad, just you know, she's a pretty consistent player.  Rather I make a lot of birdies and make it easier but I didn't have such a great day. 
 It's just a pretty calm day.  The last two holes actually I was a little off because for some reason they were a little too long for me, I don't know why.  I'm feeling really great and really excited to play match play, it's a little different from stroke play. 

 Q.  Do you have a different strategy? 
 SE RI PAK:  I don't feel like there's a big difference.  I have pretty much a solid game right now.  These green conditions are a lot earlier than Tuesday.  Tuesday was a lot faster and better.  But now they are a lot more softer because it rained.  That made a difference but I don't think anything else. 
 Hopefully three more rounds hopefully, starting tomorrow, and it will be fun.
