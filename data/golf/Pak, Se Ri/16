Q.   I know it's just another one of the many examples of players who have looked up to you for so many years, especially after that milestone moment right here at Blackwolf Run 14 years ago.   That must make you feel pretty good to hear Na Yeon Choi and all the others talk about how you inspired them and really a whole country to come over to the States and play this tour?
SE RI PAK:   Actually, it does.   It's nice to hear from all those young players in my country.   I really am proud to be a part of it, and as Na Yeon said, I was one of the days watching TV.   I was in Korea.   I was a kid watching men's tour and the LPGA events and exactly as Na Yeon said, I dreamed about it.   I want to go over there and be the best in the world.   And I am here and I guess I am the leader and they follow me.   So many players reach for those moments of inspiration.   That's what Na Yeon Choi has done, but she's got her own challenge here at 10.
