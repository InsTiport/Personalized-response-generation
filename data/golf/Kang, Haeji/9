Q.   You have the best position after first round this year.   You feeling good or strong about the game?
    HAEJI KANG:   Yeah, I am.   I actually feel great about my game because I'm hitting it pretty straight. 
    Putting is not there yet, but I think I can work on it through the week and then I'll be in good shape.

Q.   Has there been anything you're working on lately? 
    HAEJI KANG:   I been working on my putting stroke because it's been a little shaky during this season.   So I'm just trying to work on my like just the basic stuff. 
    So, yeah. 

Q.   So you bogey the first hole.   How important was the birdie on hole 13 for you?
    HAEJI KANG:   I actually holed the third shot on No. 12, the third shot.   I think it was really important for me to get back into the game so I could concentrate right on there. 

Q.   Okay.   How do you feel about the course conditions? 
    HAEJI KANG:   Like last year, the greens were faster than this year, but it's always in great condition.   So I think it's just all about me, how I play.   Nothing wrong.

Q.   One last question about the facilities for the Reignwood LPGA here.   How do you feel about the facilities, the clubhouse, golf course, and hotel?
    HAEJI KANG:   Yeah, I actually got the biggest hotel room out of the players, so I'm enjoying that.   It's really comfortable because everything is so close.   I really like it, yeah. 
    Very nice food and everything.
