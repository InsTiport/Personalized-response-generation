 Q.   Run us through your round.   How was playing with Yani?   How was everything going for you?  
HAEJI KANG:   Yani had lots of fans out there today, and they were out there for me, too, so I kind of enjoyed it on the first tee, and it was very loud the whole 18 holes, and it was very windy out there.   So it was very tough.  
   
 Q.   How did the wind ‑‑ obviously it's been a factor and been the story line today.   Did it play a huge effect on your game or negatively?  
HAEJI KANG:   Yeah.   Obviously I'm hitting a little shorter than Yani.   So a few holes I had to grab a few woods into the green, so that was it.   
   
 Q.   Does playing with Yani, how far she does hit, do you just try to mentally stick on your game or obviously you don't try to play like her, but how hard is that to kind of see her drive so far and then you come up and say, all right, I gotta drive my drive?  
HAEJI KANG:   Yeah.   I played with Lincicome before a few times, so it didn't really bother me or anything because I just tried to stick with my game and just do what I gotta do.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   And you eagled on 11?  
HAEJI KANG:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Run us through that.   
HAEJI KANG:   I hit a good solid drive, but a little left, was in a short‑cut rough, so I hit a 5‑wood.   It was about 232, and I felt this was the club, so I hit it perfectly and it was a little short of the green.   I putt about a 30‑footer in, so it was a good eagle.  
   
 Q.   Awesome.   That's great.   And then you had back‑to‑back bogeys on the front nine.   That could be a tough stretch.   How did you climb out of that?   Were you frustrated at all?   
HAEJI KANG:   I went out to two over after nine holes, but after that eagle, that kind of saved me, so it got some endorphins out of me.   So I think obviously that helped out a lot.   Putting wasn't great today.  
   
 Q.   So you're two strokes back off the lead.   Going into tomorrow what are you going to be concentrating on to keep yourself in it?  
HAEJI KANG:   Yeah.   Tomorrow is another just usual golf day, so I'll just do my best, do what I gotta do, and if I keep playing like that, then I'll be fine.  
   
 Q.   Perfect.   Congratulations.   
HAEJI KANG:   Thank you very much.
