 Q.  Very well played today.  Give us some idea what it was like to play in that?  
HAEJI KANG: Well, it was blowing 35 miles an hour, maybe to 40 miles per hour, too.  It was gusting out there, and there's a few holes that I couldn't really -- I had to back off many times; and the clubs were moving during the swing.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I just tried to hit it as low as I could and I did it really well.  Then I end up playing even.   
 Q.  Even is like a round of 5-under on any other day, isn't it?  
HAEJI KANG: Yes, I definitely think so.  It was really tough out there.   
 Q.  Was it one of those times where you don't look at a leaderboard because you sort of had to stay in the moment and concentrate so much on your own game?  
HAEJI KANG: I actually looked at the leaderboard because it was right there whenever I turned my head around.  It was right there, so I was looking.   
But people, the strokes just went coming down a lot, it was hard for other people, too.   
 Q.  When is the last time you played in winds like this, can you remember?  
HAEJI KANG: It gets pretty windy in Hawai'i but it's not this windy, definitely.  I haven't played for many years.
