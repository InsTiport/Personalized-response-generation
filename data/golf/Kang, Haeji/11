  KELLY THESIER:   We're here with Haeji Kang.   Congratulations, a great round 6‑under par today puts yourself right up there near the top of the leaderboard.   Take me through the day and what was working well for you out there?
HAEJI KANG:   I was hitting my drives perfectly and especially my irons were great, so I hit it close enough to get a lot of many chances out there.   Obviously, my putter worked great, so it was my day.

Q.   I know a little bit of a rough hiccup on 17, but then you came back on 18 with the birdie.   How important was it for you to finish strongly like that? 
HAEJI KANG:   Yeah, after the 17th hole, I was a little frustrated because it was a very bad decision from the tee box.   So there is nothing I can do about it, it just happens. 
So I tried to stay in the moment and get back into the game, and I did it.

Q.   Are you a leaderboard watcher?   Were you watching yourself creeping up toward the leaders throughout the day? 
HAEJI KANG:   Yes, I have.   I was.

Q.   How do you feel about what's going to play out, and how you'll spend the next few minutes waiting for the leaders to finish up? 
HAEJI KANG:   I'm going to enjoy myself.   I had a great week this week.   I just want to enjoy this moment.

Q.   What is your second shot on 17, were you just trying to go at the flag? 
HAEJI KANG:   No, I was actually trying to roll it to the bunker and play the bunker shot as a safe shot, but I hit it too hard, so it went over the green.

Q.   Your first round you had kind of a crazy first round.   You made a triple bogey, three bogeys, and a bunch of birdies.   Was it tough to stay in the tournament while you were doing all that crazy stuff? 
HAEJI KANG:   Yeah, on the first day, I hit it great.   It was just the one shot that got me a triple bogey.   But I've got to deal with it.   It's golf.   Anything can happen, so I just stayed in there.

Q.   Last year Suzann Pettersen came from nine shot back to win this tournament in the playoffs.   When you entered today, did you have a score in mind of what you had to shoot to get back into it? 
HAEJI KANG:   I was planning to get to 10‑under, but that didn't work.   I came close enough, so I'm really happy with my round today.
