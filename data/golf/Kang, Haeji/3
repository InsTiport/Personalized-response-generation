 Q.  So I would call that a pretty spectacular round here on No. 9 course. Would you say so?  
HAEJI KANG: I would agree so, because even if I hit a lot of short irons into the green, my short irons were really, really sharp. Anything in like 15 footers, I made pretty much everything, so I was very confident with my putter.   
 Q.  What has the last two weeks been like for you? What's it been like adjusting to a whole new course here at Pinehurst No. 9?  
HAEJI KANG: Actually I prefer No. 9 better than 6. I actually kind of struggled with my putting in No. 6 last week so I was kind of stressed out.   
But like coming over here and putting like this, it makes my confidence level higher, which is really good. I think it's really good for my golf game.   
 Q.  Q-Series is a marathon. Some people come here and they're younger and some people come here and they're older. No matter what, you're kind of all going for the same goal. What does a round like this does for any sort of confidence maybe not just for this tournament, but for the entirety of your golf game?  
HAEJI KANG: Well, I played on the LPGA for like 11 years, so that I think I have a highly advantage than the other players out here.   
So like I just treat it like a normal tournament and it's not really big different for me, yeah.   
 Q.  I also have to ask, do you have your dog here this week with you?  
HAEJI KANG: Oh, yes, I do. His name is Kong, King Kong.   
 Q.  What kind of dog is he?  
HAEJI KANG: Pomeranian.   
 Q.  Is it nice being able to bring your dog along and bring some sort of support with you?  
HAEJI KANG: Oh, yes. I actually wanted to bring him this week because when you have a bad days and stuff like that, he definitely makes my stress go away. So like, yeah, I'm enjoying it.   
 Q.  So who is watching him?  
HAEJI KANG: My mom is actually dog sitting right now, so I got to pay her a lot. (Laughter.)
