Q. So there was a define change from yesterday to today. I think it had to do a lot with the weather; would you agree?
HAEJI KANG: I definitely agree, because it was actually 39 this morning. We can't really warmup in 39.
Yeah, definitely makes a huge change because the ball doesn't fly long like last two days. It was quite tough, yeah.
Q. Was that something you maybe thought about yesterday going into today, or did you know it was going to be this low or feel this low?
HAEJI KANG: Sorry, I didn't get that.
Q. Did you think about this yesterday, about how cold it was going to be, and did you prepare do you think enough mentally?
HAEJI KANG: Oh, yes, yes, yes. I always check the weather, and I figured today was going to be little chilly and I knew the score wasn't going to be high like last two days, so I was kind of prepared mentally so I could play quite well.
Yeah.
Q. We're getting to the end of such a marathon. You said that you've had 11 years on tour so you kind of felt like you have that professional experience. What's it going to feel like tomorrow when kind of all of this is over? Is there sense of relief that two weeks are over?
HAEJI KANG: Oh, of course, yeah. I was looking forward to it because I'm going back to Korea for about a month so I can finally drink with may friends and stuff like that.
Q. Are you looking forward to that kind of relaxation period? During that kind of off-season time do you pick up the clubs or take a month off entirely from golf?
HAEJI KANG: I usually take a month off because I really need that so I can get back to it and focus again. So, yeah.
Q. When did you realize that a break from golf was kind of needed for you in the off-season?
HAEJI KANG: Since I played on the LPGA Tour, because like all year long golfing it's like a lot of stress. Mentally and physically I really need a rest. Yeah.
