  Q. Hole in one on No. 11.  Talk us through what happened there, please.
 HAEJI KANG:   It was about 153 to the flag and soon as I hit it like I knew it was perfect.  But I wasn't really honestly expecting the ball to go in the hole, but everyone saw it went in and I was like super excited.  Yeah, that was it.
 Q. Is this your first hole-in-one?
 HAEJI  KANG:   This is my third, but my second hole-in-one was in 2008, so it's been a while.  So I was very excited to have one.
 Q. Good.  Overall not the probably two days you were looking for, but you were just telling me you had quite the saga of getting here and now you're here.  Tell us if you don't mind about your problems getting here.
 HAEJI  KANG:   Well, my bags didn't arrive from Orlando until Tuesday night, so it was a little bit of a crazy week for me to start.  So I felt like I wasn't prepared for the week when I started yesterday.
 But I guess everything just happens for a reason, so I'll just, yeah, let it go and get ready for the next tournament.
 Q. Still good memories of the hole-in-one, right?
 HAEJI KANG:   Yes.
