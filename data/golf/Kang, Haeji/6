 Q.  A nice 4-under round today.  Currently in second.  
HAEJI KANG: Thank you.   
 Q.  How did you deal with the wind today?  It was very windy.  
HAEJI KANG: Well, first of all, I really like this golf course.  I played here many times.  I'm really familiar with this wind.   
So I think all this experience like really helped last few years.  I think I just felt really home.   
 Q.  Good.  That's always got to be a good feeling.  
HAEJI KANG: Yeah, yeah.   
 Q.  Talk me through your round today.  Any moments that stood out or just a steady day?  
HAEJI KANG: I actually putted really good.  Like I didn't miss any -- like anything inside six-footer, and I made like couple mid-range and one long putt.  So I think that was really a good thing.  I putted well.   
 Q.  You said your experience helps you in the wind here.  Do you have to change your game at all to play in the wind?  Is it more mental, do you think?  
HAEJI KANG: It's definitely mental.  Like you got to really trust where you're playing.  You got to hit it low.   
So I practiced those on the range to help it out on the golf course.   
 Q.  Okay.  So what do you do now?  You had a great round.  What do you do to get ready for tomorrow?  
HAEJI KANG: I'll just practice a little bit.  Just practice a little bit more putts and just get ready for tomorrow.  Rest, rest well.   
 Q.  Yes.  
HAEJI KANG: Have fun.   
 Q.  What do you do here on the island to have fun?  
HAEJI KANG: I haven't been to the ocean yet, so I will go to the beach and just chill.  Yeah, just sightsee.  Yeah, eat great food.   
 Q.  What is your favorite thing to eat here?  
HAEJI KANG: Acai bowl.   
 Q.  Acai bowl?  
HAEJI KANG: Yes, yes.  It's my favorite.   
 Q.  Awesome.  I'll have to try one of those.
