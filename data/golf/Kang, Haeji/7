 Q.  Can you talk a little bit about your round?  
HAEJI KANG: Well, my shots were going pretty good.  I didn't really have a lot of opportunities on the greens because I didn't hit it close enough.  But on the way coming in, I had a couple opportunities and I made some good finishes.   
 Q.  Minus-3, your thoughts about the round and heading into tomorrow?  
HAEJI KANG: I think I feel much better with my putting right now.  So I think I'll just keep on doing what I was doing.  I think it will be a good round tomorrow.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts on the Canadian crowd?  
HAEJI KANG: Well, some people were loud out there, but I think most of them had good manners out on the golf course and I love how they do it.   
 Q.  Your goal for the next three rounds?  
HAEJI KANG: It's really important to hit it close to the flag because the greens are pretty tricky, and then roll them in.
