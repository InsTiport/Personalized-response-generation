Q. Tell us about your round.  Obviously you have to be happy to get this done in the morning.
HAEJI KANG: Yeah, I was striking the ball really well, so on this course I think hitting it on the fairway, keeping it on the fairway is really important.  I did that really good, and plus my iron shots were good enough to make some birdies, easy birdies today.  But I didn't really make a lot of 15-footers, so I'm looking forward to that one going into tomorrow.
Q. What kind of are you going to take with you into the second round for tomorrow?
HAEJI KANG: I'll try to do the same thing like today.  I'll just keep it in the fairway, and with my caddie I just try to talk about other than golf to keep myself out of the game because I don't really play well when I'm too focused.  I'll just play nice and easy.
Q. Was the weather forecast something you paid attention to?  It sounds like there might be storms in the afternoon.  I don't know if you were pleased to have an earlier tee time.
HAEJI KANG: Because I was the first off, so I didn't really pay attention to the weather.  I knew that I was going to finish before whatever is coming.
Q. Do you prefer to go off on day one in the morning versus in the afternoon?  I know you don't have a choice, but at the same time if you get your choice...
HAEJI KANG: Yes, if I have a choice I would like to go early on the first day because then I would get a little more rest time for the second round.
