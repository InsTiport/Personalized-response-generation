Q.   Run me through your round, your birdies.   How did everything go?
HAEJI KANG:   I had five birdies, and my putting was working great.   I made a really bad mistake on 18.   But I came back.

Q.   How did you think the course set up to your game specifically?
HAEJI KANG:   I think compared to last year the greens were soft.   It wasn't as hard as last year, so it was much easier to hit a shot into the green because it stops. 

Q.   Just coming out of the first round, coming out strong, what do you think bringing into tomorrow and the next couple rounds? 
HAEJI KANG:   Yeah, I think I probably need to work on my irons a little bit more.   My putter is working very good, so I think I'll be driving.

Q.   How was your driving?
HAEJI KANG:   Driving was good, too. 

Q.   What would be the most difficult thing about the course that challenged you the most in going forward? 
HAEJI KANG:   Last year missing the fairway was very tough part because they have really thick grass, but this year they cut it a little shorter.   I think even if you miss a fairway, it will be fine.
