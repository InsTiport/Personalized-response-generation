RICHIE RAMSAY: The wind was down off the right.  Was kind of looking at 7-iron just to hold it up.  It was right down it, and I kind of -- in mid-air, I did think, "Car," that's what I thought, but I didn't see anything because I thought it was going to be a curse, and I pitched it short and someone is like, "Go on, go on!"  And it disappeared, and of course just like jumping around the tee box high-fiving.   
Yeah, it's a great feeling.  Will obviously look back -- tried to get in the car but it was locked.   
 Q.  You've been in it now.  What do you reckon?  
RICHIE RAMSAY: It's beautiful inside.  It's beautiful inside.  The back seat obviously reclines right back and it feels like you're in a plane, a business class seat that you can lie all the way back in and have a nice little snooze.  It's so comfy.  You've got the tablet, the skylight, leather and the speakers, just fantastic.   
 Q.  Is it going to take a little while to sink in that with one shot, you've earned something worth 170,000 Euro?  
RICHIE RAMSAY: Just you saying that, I'm just starting to process it at the moment.  We were walking down 9 and my caddie is like, "Oh, your car's over there."  I looked over and I was like, that is mine actually.  It just took a while to process.   
But yeah, fantastic feeling and it's obviously thanks very much to BMW.  Fantastic car and very glad to put it up for a prize.   
 Q.  And it can sit neatly in your garage at home, can it?  
RICHIE RAMSAY: It will look fantastic in the driveway.   
And the great thing is, it's safe as houses and we have a 3 1/2 month old daughter, so something to keep her nice and safe in.  Plenty of space for her to sit in the back and make plenty of noise, knowing her.
