Q. Second round of the Portugal Masters, how do you sum that one up?
RICHIE RAMSAY: Yeah, sort of just came out of nowhere, been in sort of a downturn, but my daughter, she's been out supporting me, a small supporter but a big support at the same time.  She needs something to shout about because dad didn't been playing so good.
Yeah, it was a great round.  I had a little bit of a thought of 59 but yeah, just can't complain with 10-under.  Any time you shoot 10-under is a great day.
Q. You've wean Scott Jamieson, Nicolas Colsaerts the last few years come pretty close.  Knowing conditions were ideal and what the golf course produces, what were you thinking heading out today?
RICHIE RAMSAY: I was just trying to play as well as I could and give myself lots of opportunities.  Give myself opportunities, I know I could make some putts.  I managed to do that and just kept the momentum going.  That was the big thing today.
Before I kind of stalled the momentum, maybe not getting up-and-down or 3-putting, but today I just played really solid and just kept the momentum going, reeled off the birdies, and I got the mind-set of just start chasing birdies on the back nine.  Yeah, it worked.
Q. Quite a fun golf course to play when it's going like that, and Race to Dubai, I'm sure Top 60 is the forefront of your mind now?
RICHIE RAMSAY: Yeah, I would love to go to Dubai again.  It's probably one of our best tournaments.  I get to take Olivia if I get there, so that's a big bonus for me and a big bonus for her.  I'm sure she'll be cheering me on at home.
