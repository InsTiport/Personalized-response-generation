  RICHIE RAMSAY:   It was really good.   I played fantastic out there.   I actually shaved quite a lot of edges with some putts.   I stayed patient.   And then I managed for a few then to drop and just kept on just playing steady. 
It was fun out there.   Gonzo played well, as well, so it was kind of back and forth, back and forth.   Nice way to finish the first day and get off to a good start. 

Q.   I was going to ask you, were you getting a wee bit frustrated, especially the front nine, one or two almost went in but didn't quite drop?
RICHIE RAMSAY:   Yeah, a couple kind of lipâ€‘outs but like I say you have to stay patient.   I was hitting really good putts and I managed to get a few on the back nine, which, you know, is going to make lunch taste a lot better.

Q.   Have you seen the leaderboard?
RICHIE RAMSAY:   I did look at it. 

Q.   It's a Who's Who of Scottish golf. 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   I did see a lot of the boys up there, Marc got out early and shot a good score and Stevie, so it's nice to have the Scots up there.
But I'm just going to take it one day at a time, and going off the attitude that I'm going to play and try to enjoy it and then, you know, Sunday afternoon, we'll see where we are and hopefully if we can play like today, it should be a pretty good result.
