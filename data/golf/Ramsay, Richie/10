 Q.  65, how was that?  
RICHIE RAMSAY: It was good. Very steady.  Just holed a lovely putt on 8, and then hit 3-wood on the ninth.  Rolled that in which was a great bonus to make eagle there.   
Then very steady on the back nine.  A couple of nice two putts just to make some pars coming in, and sort of right in the mix.  Great field and great event.  Just looking forward to tomorrow.   
Around the turn after I made eagle, I had a great putt on 10, great putt on 11, great putt on 12 and just tried to stay patient and keep on rolling good putts because I felt they were going to go in the hole.  My pace was very good today.  That was probably key because the long ones at the end were basically just tap-ins, which is nice.   
And yeah, just felt like, you know, I've just been there or thereabouts for a long, long time and I feel that getting in the mix tomorrow, back nine Sunday, I just love it.  Pressure is just brilliant.  Put me in that position, it's the best place you can be; all the practice, and come down the stretch under the pressure with a great field and also a great turnout, I can't wait for it.   
 Q.  Weather doesn't look fantastic tomorrow.  What's the game plan for that?  
RICHIE RAMSAY: Well, we've just got to kind of ride it out, it's coming from Scotland.  Just have to deal with it.  Some guys will like it and just have to bring the attitude that will deal with it the best.  Persevere; sometimes when it was raining a little bit like today, have a good set of waterproofs and go from there.
