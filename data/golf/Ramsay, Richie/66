   RICHIE RAMSAY: It was a bit up and down today but I am especially pleased that I managed to gturn things around after a very poor start. I bogeyed my second hole (11th) and then had a double bogey seven on the 12th where I went into the water on the left.  
 But I birdied the next hole and after that managed to settle down. I have come into this week a lot more relaxed, and just trying to enjoy it. I've been determined not to get myself flustered and today was particuarly pleasing in that respect. I could have finished a couple of shots better but I did hole a 100 foot putt from just off the green for an eagle two on the sixth so I suppose I shouldn't be too greedy. It was also nice to finish with a six footer for birdie on the ninth, our 18th, and that's particuarly important going into tomorrow. To come back in 32 after going out in 38 has kept me right in contention.  
 I'm hoping for a lot of Scottish support tomorrow but again, in such a great field, I will just be concentrating on what I'mdoing and try to stay relaxed. My last top ten finish was in Wales in June and it would be wonderful to have a good finish here. To be in contention to win it over the last few holes would be a dream come true.
