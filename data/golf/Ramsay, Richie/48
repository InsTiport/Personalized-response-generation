  RICHIE RAMSAY:   It was really solid.   It was good fun playing with Marc.   Played with him before a few times.   He's a top guy.   So good to sort of feed off that. 
Played steady again.   Got off to a really nice start.   Made two nice putts to start.   Just nice and steady. 
Bogeyed 12, bounced back sort of straightaway, a couple birdies.   And then a great way to finish on the last, because you know, struggling to probably get up in two.   Hit a nice shot in there and then rolled in another putt which was good.

Q.   When you started, there was so many scores earlier in the day; did you know you would have to shoot something, maybe 67, 68, like you did to stay in the hunt?
RICHIE RAMSAY:   You sort of look at it and think, everybody is chasing birdies.   So gets you to play a bit more aggressive.   You see the scores and think, geez, everyone is holing putts and they are not going to hit flags.
But I don't think it's as easy as the scoring suggests, but I think guys are just all playing well.   I played good today.   Shot 4‑under.   Saw the finish Sergio had, 3, 3, 7, 2, 3, or something, which is crazy.   Take the 7 out there of and he's chasing 59. 
But I think the fact is, the greens are really good.   The greens are really nice.   It's nice weather out there.   There's a little bit of breeze today which made it a little bit tougher. 
And they have changed up the course a little bit, put tees forward, which makes it more interesting to be honest.   It makes it more interesting for the spectators and it makes it a little bit more interesting for the players.   It's nice to have that variety on the golf course. 
You know, I just adapted well to it today and played steady again.   The game feels in good shape and every morning I've been kind of just re‑setting and saying, let's go out, commit to every shot.
