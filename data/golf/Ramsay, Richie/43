  RICHIE RAMSAY:   Still sort of touch and go this morning.     I didn't know what I was going to do, hit balls and take it from there.   It was still bothering me.   It's not painful but more just tight now, where before, I wasn't great, but I'm going to sort of chip‑and‑putt, and then do my workout to sort of strengthen up and get a bit of physio on it. 
So limit the practise and sort of go out there and try to take my chances when I can, because I know I'm not sort of 100 per cent, but I know I've got next week off, as well.   I've already put a few things in place to sort of work on that. 

Q.   How did it happen? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   Just kind of a lesson at Iain at Renaisassance on Sunday and tried to make a swing change and my upper body was in left, and instead of moving it with my shoulder, I kind of went this way, and then I started hitting balls like that, and I didn't think anything of it. 
And the next morning, my left neck was tight as anything, and I was really struggling to hit through it.   When I hit it, I could feel it up my neck, which is not a good sign.   Just tight, and this morning, the right one was tight, it seems to flip from side to side.   It's a problem I've had for about a year now but I've managed it well and it's been all right but that swing changed kicked it off again. 
The PGA, probably Akron and the PGA were the first two tournaments that I really thought like, oh, I'm doing my stretching before and I was doing my stretching after, and I wasn't feeling any massive niggles or anything.   I did some work in the gym the last week, felt really good. 
And then obviously like the Monday, sponsor day for Metrol and they were really good.   I played seven holes and couldn't play any longer and the guy was just like, take it easy.   Just something I've got to be aware of, and try and manage. 
But you know, I'm really pleased with the way I played today and really pleased to get through a round without anything sort of happening.

Q.   How close were you to not teeing up? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   I would say I was 50/50.   If I stood there and I started hitting balls and I could feel it through my neck, then it's only going to get worse, because it could be okay.   But if you think about it, if you want to do well, you have to play 72 holes, and that means four days, walking four rounds.   And if you don't think you can do that, there isn't any point in teeing it up.   These guys are really good out here, and if you're not 100 per cent, it's tough to sort of compete. 
I felt that it was fine today, and the guys in the physio truck have been fantastic.   If it wasn't for them, I don't think I would play this week.   So a lot of credit has got to go to them.   I actually played really good today, and a couple more putts would have been nice.
But it was good fun playing with Alvaro and ThorbjÃ¸rn.   The two shots he hit to 9, he got up in two, and it's 620 into the wind.   He hit one down the second, which was just miles down there.   It would be great fun to be here because you would just be swagging up to the first tee hitting it 320 every hole.   He hit 7‑iron into the second.   It's just a different golf course he's playing.   I mean, if I had that length, I mean, sky's the limit.

Q.   What did he shoot? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   I think he shot 2‑under.   But yeah, he's a nice guy and great fun all the way around.   Very interesting to watch and good for me, although I was looking at where he was hitting it, I wasn't paying attention to how he was getting it around. 
That's an old thing that used to affect me, like get frustrated because guys can hit it a lot further and end of the day, just comes down to swing speed, and you've kind of got it or you don't.   Certain things you can do to improve and hit it straight and that's what I do, which is the gym work, but apart from that, I'm not going to, I've never been renowned as a bomber. 

Q.   How far behind are you on average? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   If I hit a good one, he hits a good one, it's 30 yards and that's been slightly generous to me, I would say.   He's got to hit 3‑wood off a couple of tees which is fine, but when he can open up his shoulders, like the second was a good example, I hit one down the right, because the bunkers there, for me I've got to hit it kind of right then left, where more it's just going straight at the green‑‑ he hit 7‑iron in there and when you can drop it and stop it that far, it's a nice thing to have.
