Q. How was that 5-under 66?
RICHIE RAMSAY: It was really good. Obviously fantastic golf course. A little bit different this year. A bit colder, a bit softer, so the course is playing quite long.
But yeah, it's a joy to play a golf course like this, because it just tests like the whole part of your game and mentally, obviously there's a lot of water out there, so you have to be very committed to your shots.
Q. There are still some good scores out there. Are you surprised scoring stayed fairly low?
RICHIE RAMSAY: Because it's a little softer than usual, you can go at a few more flags and play a little bit more aggressive off some of the holes with driver because the ball is not kind of bouncing into trouble. I think if you're on a day, there is a score out there.
But at the same time, if you're just a little bit off, it's easy to drop a few shots and then it becomes a little bit more of a battle rather than sort of 4-, 5-, 6-under par.
Q. So now that the tournament has moved to October, when it was in July, do you prefer it being in October or July?
RICHIE RAMSAY: I do like it in July just because the golf course tends to play firm and fast, and it means you've got to think a lot more around the course, where you can hit 3-irons and stingers off tees and try and chase the ball. It's just a more difficult test. Obviously everybody likes playing in short sleeves.
