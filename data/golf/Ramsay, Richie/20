Q. Richie, two-hole victory ended in some style.  Talk about the final putt.
RICHIE RAMSAY: Yeah, just off the green on the right-hand side about 30 feet.  I was looking just for two putts, but nice one to make to make eagle on the last and win by two holes.
Q. Yesterday you told us you drove the ball ridiculously well and needed to hole more putts.  Give us your verdict on today's play.
RICHIE RAMSAY: Drove the ball well again today.  Probably slightly tougher conditions with the rain and I putted really nice today.  I holed a couple of nice ones, shaved a lot of edges.  I just need to hit the short irons a little bit closer and give myself better looks at it.  I was still in good form today and take that to this afternoon.
Q. Obviously the schedule is changed and you'll play two matches today and potentially two tomorrow and one on Sunday.  What's the biggest challenge of a run like that when you're playing a lot of golf in such a short time?
RICHIE RAMSAY: Just be prepared for it, and patience is big in match play, but I think also, you know, rest up.  I think the other day when I won, I nearly did too much.  I knew that if I was going to do well in this tournament, I was going to have to play quite a lot of matches and obviously you're going to have a lot of tough ones, as well.  Just rest up, be prepared and have your downtime be good and when you get going, focus and try and dial it in.
