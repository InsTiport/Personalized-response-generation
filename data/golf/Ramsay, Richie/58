Q.   How would you reflect on two days so far at this tournament? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   It was good.   I think I took a bit of a break last week, really looking forward to coming here.   Fantastic city, and the golf course is to my liking.   So playing really steady, and I had actually quite a lot of chances on the front side and I didn't really make too many putts. 
And then I played solid, I had a good 2‑putt on the par5, and then I hit the pin on next with my wedge, which nearly went about 25 feet away, but I managed to hole that which was a great sort of momentum keeper and then obviously to birdie the last was nice, because it's never an easy hole coming down there. 
All in all, a really good day's work.   Looking forward to tomorrow.   I just stayed patient, hit some lovely shots.   I holed a good putt on the 6th hole after 3‑putting the fifth, which was crucial probably, and then I had a good chance on the next, a good chance on the 8th, as well, and missed them and pretty much managed to stiff it on 9.   Just staying patient.   I really enjoyed coming here, and that kind of keeps your attitude pretty solid. 
Obviously a big week next week which I'm looking forward to, and then after that, Christmastime, so you know, all good things ahead. 

Q.   What's not to like, but what do you particularly admire about this Fanling course and Hong Kong in general? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   It's just an old, traditional course.   It plays bouncy and you have to keep it in the short stuff to give yourself chances.   It's not overly long and doesn't suit the kind of bombers‑‑ you have to move the ball and shape it.   It's a bit more old school instead of the long courses which are softer and you've kind of got a bit more space off the tee.   I really, really like that. 
Hong Kong, just fantastic place.   Great views.   It's kind of like the sort of Asian New York with all of the big buildings.   I've been down in the centre, getting a few suits tailored so it's quite good fun. 

Q.   So you've ordered those for rest of the season with the big dinners and things you'll have to go to as champion of this and that? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   More so going out with my pals (laughing) not all the big dinners.   More so for the Christmas and New Year's bashes to be honest. 
No, it's just been good fun, and like I say, I enjoy coming here, and if we can push on tomorrow and get in the hunt, come back on Sunday, that's where I want to be.   I've been sort of trying to push the door open again for another one, and has not just happened, and there's probably not a better place to do it, and especially the week before Dubai which would provide a huge boost. 

Q.   How much of a buzz do you get out of going up against Quiros and McIlroy and those guys? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   That's what it's about.   You know, it's nice, because you know when you're gray and old, and you can sit there and say, coming down the back nine‑‑ which would be nice.   But I know how good these guys are.
But around this course, I feel I've got‑‑ not an advantage, but I feel comfortable on the golf course.   I feel comfortable on every tee.   And if I just make a few putts here and there, then I feel that I can be in with a shout come Sunday. 

Q.   A healthy respect, as opposed to an awe?
RICHIE RAMSAY:   There's a respect and I think that's what you want to have coming down the back nine.   Like when I was playing at Valderrama, going up against Garcia and JimÃ©nez, that was fantastic, and I thrive off that, and I play better, I focus a bit more and you feel you have to play more.   You kind of play a little bit more aggressive, which on a Sunday afternoon is what you've got to do. 
You've got to go for that win, not second or third place.   Everybody remembers the guy holding the trophy.   It will be fantastic if I can come down the stretch and face one of them.   But as long as I can play good and hopefully maybe have some silverware, then I'll be a happy man.
