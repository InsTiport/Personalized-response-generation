  RICHIE RAMSAY:   It was a great day, great start.   Nice to play St. Andrews first, get a number on the board.   I know the boys‑‑ well, the way Gracey was playing at Kingsbarns‑‑

Q.   Is it confidence with you? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   Yeah, had a bit of confidence.   I think things are going well.   I got everything I need in place.   Like I've got a great place to practise in Scotland and a great place to practise in America.   A lot of support from some good sponsors, makes a big difference.   Obviously having the wedding was great, having sort of time to take off and relax. 
Flew to Atlanta on the Sunday after the wedding, and had three days to practise in Atlanta and come over here.   It's a place I coming over to.   I love St. Andrews, it's a beautiful place and great kind of atmosphere.   Doesn't matter whether there's a golf tournament on or not.   It's always a great place to come and visit.

Q.   So is this the honeymoon?
RICHIE RAMSAY:   It's a mini‑honeymoon.   It's going to be the end of the year in South Africa.   So as long as I keep putting the numbers on the board like this, she'll be happy. 
All in all, a great day, and yeah, just nice to get the number on the board on the golf course, which is scorable, and especially under the conditions today. 

Q.   Were you in America when the Ryder Cup was over?
RICHIE RAMSAY:   I was here practising‑‑ I know it sounds funny but I was practising at Carnoustie.   I had to leave at 7.00 in the morning from St. Andrews to get there and play around.   I went to bed at 9.15.   So I didn't see all of it.   I saw the highlights afterwards, but the only way I'm going to compete with these guys is to try and get better.   I would love to watch it.   It's one of my favourite tournaments. 
But I know that in order to compete and try and be as good as they are, I need to be going to bed and not watching them winning The Ryder Cup.   So it's one of those things, I saw the highlights the next day, that was incredible. 
I think it sets up great for Scotland.   I think if we can get a sellout in two years' time, it will be unbelievable. 

Q.   Did you go to bed thinking they had lost it?
RICHIE RAMSAY:   I watched it, Luke had won his first match, and the tide was turning, and the great thing was they were getting blue numbers up and starting to fight them.   I think you just never know.   I think I was really surprised that we were behind as much as they were. 
They didn't play that great, but I thought OlazÃ¡bal would really kind of bring the best out of them, and I think that's‑‑ I think that's what made the difference.   They are all great players, same on the U.S. side.   But OlazÃ¡bal has a presence, like I don't know what it is, but he's got something about him that makes you want to play for him I would say.   Seve thing as well; you put that combination, I think you can get anybody to push to kind of their best game, and that's what they needed on the last day.

Q.   The way you've been playing recently, a long way to go, but two years has to be a realistic target. 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   I think I'm not going to start saying that I want to play in The Ryder Cup, but all I would say is that when I was 16, a dream of mine was to play on The European Tour and to win on The European Tour, and I've done that.   And I think it's like‑‑ when I look at it that way, and I look at it the distance I've got to go to The Ryder Cup, they are similar ideas, similar dreams. 
But I'm a big believer that if you work hard, then you can achieve a lot.   It's a big, big question mark, but it will be something that I would love to do. 

Q.   Obviously Atlanta, you made a big play on that, but rightly so; the Renaisassance when it comes to a week like this, obviously the links affect is a big help this week? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   Massive help.   I mean, I spoke to Jerry early in the season and he was fantastic, he's letting me practise there.   But it's an unbelievable facility.   I mean, you drive up there, the service is first class.   The range is brilliant because you've got a double‑sided range and you've got the trees there, which shield you from the wind.   And if there is wind, you can hit any different direction. 
The greens are good.   The golf course is good with potential to be really, really good.   I think when the clubhouse is built, it will be one of the best clubhouses in Scotland.   And it will have most importantly for me, it's going to have a gym, so I can go down there, go down from Edinburgh, practise the whole day, do my gym work, get back and I'm all on site and I've done it.   If you can get the right weather, it's perfect.

Q.   It's been talked about as a possible European Tour event venue going forward; do you see that? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   Honestly when you look at the courses out with the open tracks, I cannot see anywhere else that's got the facilities it does and has the infrastructure, the space, as well. 
Once the clubhouse is up, and people start‑‑ more people start coming to it, they will realise how good it is.   I think next year at The Open, that's going to be the kind of platform.   And like I say, I'm just fortunate to be a part of that.   And Jerry's been really good and kind of helped out.   I think that's the difference between our approach, some other clubs, were not probably as receptive.   I think Jerry is a very forward‑thinking guy and I think that shows with the fact that he's kind of helping me to come along and practise. 

Q.   Your American friend, is that the guy from Atlanta?
RICHIE RAMSAY:   No, that's Dick Gilbert from New York.   He was the guy who gave me the putter that I won the U.S. Am with and I caddied for him probably in about 2000, so I've known him for the best part of sort of probably eight, nine, ten years now.   So it was great to play with him and he was a good laugh the whole way around. 

Q.   Is that the guy that was unwell? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   Yeah, he was unwell at the start of the year but he's a lot better now.   He's just got to have some gall stones or something taken out.   But he's a great guy, and he's one of the three people that I speak to for advice on golf, because he's very smart and knows what he's doing and he understands the golf because he's played around Tour guys enough that he understands to go out and let them go and play.   It was nice to play with him today.
