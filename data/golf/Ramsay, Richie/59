  Q. Well played today, a lot of birdies out there for you today, that's not easy to do on this course?  
 RICHIE RAMSAY: No, it's not easy. I played lovely. I holed some good putts, which was really encouraging. But I was just steady. A little disappointed with the last couple holes but to shoot 3-under par out there on probably the harder part of the day when the greens are firmer, and the wind is a little bit stronger than it has been, it was really pleasing.  
  
  Q. You say this course suits you and your style of play. You're showing that so far. What's it going to take in the final round then maybe to get the job done?   
 RICHIE RAMSAY: It's difficult to put a number on it. But you know, it's going to take someone whose really committed to their shot-making and has the ability to play under pressure, because those last four or five holes can catch out the best players in the world. I played them well today and executed my shots, like I said, fantastically well, just how I visualised it and that's what I've got to do tomorrow. If I can do, that there's going to be a shot in coming down that back nine.   
  
  Q. Because they are great to watch from a spectator's point of view, but as a player, is there a harder finish on The European Tour?   
 RICHIE RAMSAY: I don't think so, no. There's just no margin for error really. You've got to stand up there like I say and commit to your shots. The ball is flying over a lot of water out there in the last four holes, so it's nice when the ball lands down and you can go up there and have a 2-putt for a par.   
 Like I say, it's tough. There probably is no tougher finish. It's a great spectacle and it's going to have a great spectacle for tomorrow and obviously that's why they have chosen it for The Ryder Cup.
