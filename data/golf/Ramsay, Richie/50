  RICHIE RAMSAY:   I played nice, my short game was really poor on the front side.   I was 3‑over and I was kind of up against it.   Didn't really commit to a couple of shots.   Played nice on the back side, really hit some really good shots.   Made a crucial putt on 17 for bogey from about eight feet after hitting in the water off the tee.   And then made a 3 at the last, which is always kind of a bonus.   So level par after being 3‑over after nine, you know, definitely more than happy with.   
Again, a scoring course tomorrow at Kingsbarns, if you can put a nice number there, it would put me in a good position.  
   
 Q.   Despite a really good score yesterday, coming to Carnoustie is all a different prospect, isn't it?   
RICHIE RAMSAY:   It is.   It's always difficult.   It just doesn't matter whether you play it's flat calm or not or the wind is right‑to‑left or left‑to‑right.   It's always tricky.   And it's cold.   The ball is running on the fairways, but the ball is not flying as far as it does in the summer.   
So playing reasonably long, as well.   But it's in great condition.   The greens are unbelievable.   It's great to play and you feel like you can make some putts out there.   I didn't probably hole my fair share today.   But you know, hopefully they all drop tomorrow or Sunday.
