Q.   Your thoughts on another successful day out there? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   Really pleasing, yeah, 69 is a good score.   Nice little eagle on 14 got me going.   It was tricky out there at times.   Like I say, the greens were firming up, so you couldn't go for every flag.   You had to be selective about when to be aggressive and when to be patient, and did that well. 
But the most important thing, second day in a row, the attitude was really good.   Really pleased with that and got some good friends and family out there watching, so it was nice to play well while they are out watching.

Q.   Excitement going into the weekend and today? 
RICHIE RAMSAY:   Yeah, it's great to be up there.   I have a few goals I want to achieve and it would be nice to push my way into the Royal Trophy.   I love team golf.   That was one of the goals.   But at the moment, it's just try and stay patient and positive, great two days ahead.   I've got to embrace it and just go out there and have fun and hopefully the golf will take care of itself.
