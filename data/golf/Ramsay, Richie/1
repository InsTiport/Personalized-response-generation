Q. Going into the weekend, how happy are you with that round of 69?
RICHIE RAMSAY: Yeah, really happy. It wasn't easy out there today. The wind died down a little bit. It got really cool at the end and obviously darkness is just coming in. Any time you shoot under par around Le Golf National, it's a pretty good day's work.
Q. You mentioned the darkness and the conditions. Were they the toughest part of the golf course today?
RICHIE RAMSAY: Yeah, definitely the breeze was pretty strong in parts, and the greens were still pretty quick. Anything downhill, downwind; I thought the greens were really rapid in places. You had to be careful where you left it, some tricky spots. You had to keep on battling.
It's one of those days where everybody is going to make mistakes and you need to minimise those and hopefully take advantage of the good shots you hit in there. Disappointed to finish with a bogey but overall really happy because it was a tough start.
Q. You mentioned the tough start, quite eventful. How proud are you of your ability to battle back from the double bogey at the start and post a decent number?
RICHIE RAMSAY: Yeah, I'm one of those people, with a bit of experience, accept when you make mistakes, whether it be on the golf course or kind of in life in general. But it's how you deal with them, and yeah, really proud to bounce back well and obviously 69 is a good score considering the way I started.
I'm just chasing that Nedbank. Trying to walk before I can run. I really want to get in Nedbank because I love it down there. But yeah, good position for the weekend, and I'll be chasing that on Saturday and Sunday.
