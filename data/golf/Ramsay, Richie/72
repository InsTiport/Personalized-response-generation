  Q.  (On his play).   
 RICHIE RAMSAY:  it was great fun.  I really enjoyed it.  the guys are great.  especially 15, 16.  you can't get better than that.  I hit irons really nice.  mentally probably the best I've been.  if you want to score today you want to putt well.  I didn't do that.  I'm up for a challenge.  I like the challenge.  today had some good iron shots.  Augusta's tricky.  if you miss by three or four feet, you get penalized.  I'm more than happy with the way I played.  you're always going to be nervous.  to have that many people clap for you is a great feeling.  you are not going to get a bigger occasion to tee it up on the first tee at the Masters with a defending champion.
