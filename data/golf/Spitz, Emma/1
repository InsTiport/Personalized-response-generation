  Q. Can you tell how you felt today?  I know it started with a bogey but birdies came.
 EMMA SPITZ:   Overall I was really happy with my round.  It's just amazing to get the chance to play two rounds here.  I think I drove my ball really well, and I knew from last year, I was driving my ball bad and I just, you know, you just can't get to the greens if you don't hit the fairways.  I was like hitting really good shots and making really nice putts, and the end, it was just a little unfortunate.  I missed a really short one on 17 that was just, yeah, not great.  But I'm so happy with the way I played and overall score.  I'm just a little -- I was a little sad on the end but it's fine.
 Q. When you got to 17, did you realize what was happening with the leaderboard?
 EMMA SPITZ:   Yeah, I mean, there's so many leaderboards out there.  They are so big; it's almost impossible to not look at them.  But it didn't really like stress me out.  I think I was very confident in my game.  The bunker shot on 17, it almost went in and the putt, I didn't feel 100 percent comfortable and then a plane flew over and I probably should have just stepped back and like get back and restart my routine.
 But you know, you just learn out of your mistakes and maybe next time I won't do that again.
 Q. What are the main things you enjoyed and learned here?
 EMMA SPITZ:   Just coming here and playing this course is just amazing.  It's so much fun.  There's just so much history, and I'm a golf nerd, so it's just a place that you want to go to.
 For next year, I think I've learned more about both of the courses and I think I did a much better job here playing at Augusta National than I did last year which was great.  I'm just looking forward for next year.
