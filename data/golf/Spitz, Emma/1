Q. So tell me about how the round went today and what were you feeling while you were out there?
EMMA SPITZ: I felt pretty good.  I hit pretty good irons and off the tee, I hit pretty much every fairway, which helped.  But it wasn't too easy because yesterday was really cold in the morning, so the distances were just so different, and I didn't hit one of the same shot into the green that I did yesterday in the practice round.
But I felt comfortable hitting the shots, and me and my caddie, we worked together really well.
Q. Are you using an Augusta National caddie?
EMMA SPITZ: No, I have my boyfriend as a caddie.
Q. How's that, having him on the bag?
EMMA SPITZ: That's good.  So we practiced it at one tournament back at home, and it worked out really well and I think we just have fun on the course, and it works.
Q. So what are your thoughts going into tomorrow?
EMMA SPITZ: I'm just going to try to play like today, just nothing special, but just very straightforward, fairway and greens, and maybe make some more putts than today.
