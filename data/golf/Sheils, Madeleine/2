Q. Excellent finish.
MADELEINE SHEILS: Thank you.  It was fun to end on a high note like that.
Q. How was the round in general?  It looked like you were steady from start to finish.
MADELEINE SHEILS: Yeah, very steady.  I hit just about every fairway, and I think I might have hit every green for like the first time in my life, so that makes golf really easy, as it turns out.
Q. Was the heat an issue at all, the humidity?
MADELEINE SHEILS: No, I mean, we're used to playing in all different kinds of conditions, so I wouldn't really say that was too much of a problem.
Q. How do you sleep on a 66?
MADELEINE SHEILS: You know, not that different.  There's so much golf left that I just enjoy the fact that I got off to a nice start and rest up for the next three days.
Q. Did you have a feeling you'd play well today?
MADELEINE SHEILS: You know, I had a really good session with my coach last weekend, and I felt like -- I played seven weeks straight, and then I had last week off, and as soon as I like rested and refreshed myself, it was like, oh, my gosh, I can do this, like I'm okay.  I saw my coach, and I felt positive going into this whole week.
Q. What's his name?
MADELEINE SHEILS: Gabriel Hjerstedt.
Q. Anything in particular he told you coming into this week?
MADELEINE SHEILS: Yeah, it was mostly mechanical.  I just kind of needed some retuning.  I was a little bit off with my swing, a little bit off with my chipping, a little bit off with my putting, so I just kind of tweaked a few things in every part of my game, and all of a sudden I'm okay again, you know?
Q. Does this feel rewarding for the work that you've put in?
MADELEINE SHEILS: Yeah, very much so.  I finally feel comfortable in my rookie year, and now I feel very comfortable with my game, so it's nice to see them both come together.
