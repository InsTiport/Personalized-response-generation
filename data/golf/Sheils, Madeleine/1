Q. An eagle on 9; walk me through what happened there.
MADELEINE SHEILS: Yeah, it was great.  That hole is hard because there's water all up the left, so it felt really good just to hit a solid drive, and then I managed to hit my 3-wood to about 15 feet, and I was thinking the entire time about this college teammate I have who doesn't play professional golf but she plays a lot of just for-fun golf, and we have a season-long bet where any time somebody makes an eagle they get $25, and we add it up at the end of the year, so I really wanted to make eagle so that she owes me.  So it felt really great to drain that, and that's what I was thinking about, the $25 rather than trying to finish on a high note.
Q. How was your day overall?  It was kind of an up-and-down day for you?
MADELEINE SHEILS: Yeah, a little bit more up and down than yesterday.  Not quite as easy.  But still, I was never really in trouble by any means, I just didn't see as many putts fall, but stayed steady because I knew I was playing well.
Q. So you're a couple shots back as the lead sits now heading into the weekend.  How does that feel, and what's your game plan for the rest of the tournament?
MADELEINE SHEILS: Just keep doing what I'm doing, the usual boring stuff.  It's so nice to see my game in the right direction, and there's a whole lot of golf left, so I'm not going to get ahead of myself, but I'm just really pleased with where I am right now.
