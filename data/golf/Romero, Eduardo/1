  EDUARDO ROMERO:   Made a stupid mistake on the last hole.   Was a bad shot from the tee and then going into the bunker.   I feel 2‑under, make double‑bogey on the last, but played fantastic today.   Driving good, putting good, and I think it was my best round so far this year.   For the start it's okay, three more days to go.   I have a lot of confidence and I know this course, and I played good before.   You never know.   Three rounds to go.   
   
 Q.   You always seem to play well in Scotland.   
EDUARDO ROMERO:   Yes, I love Scotland, yeah, yeah, I have good memories.   It's very nice to come back to Scotland.   I have a lot of friends here.   The golf courses are fantastic.   It's okay.   I'm very happy to come back and very happy with my round.   Tomorrow is another day.   
I have a lot of business in Argentina now.   I'm designing a golf course and I don't play much in the USA, but it's okay.   I played good today, and we'll see what happens.   
   
 Q.   Conditions were perfect.   
EDUARDO ROMERO:   Fantastic.   Fantastic.   
   
 Q.   Did you notice at The Open Andres Romero had Carlos Tevez on his bag?   
EDUARDO ROMERO:   It was great. It s crazy. Tevez plays golf in Argentina. We played many. Many times together but I don t think he is a great caddy because he made 82.   
   
 Q.   Do you think it was disrespectful to the Open?   
EDUARDO ROMERO:   I would never take Tevez as a caddy because he knows nothing about golf. The lines. After six holes he told me I m tired, the bag is heavy, I want to quit. I said it s only six holes. The night before at dinner he was probably drunk! Romero asked him and said it was his dream, but afterwards it was a mistake. But it s too late!
