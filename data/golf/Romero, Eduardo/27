   EDUARDO ROMERO:  I played a bad shot from the tee and then it was okay.  It's a bogey.  You hit a bad shot, it's a bogey.  And I played good today.  My back is very good now and then much better than yesterday.  And then one more round to go. 
 So I'm back to play good.  I hit it good.  And because I missed three shots it cost me three bogeys.  But the golf is like this. 
 But I'm happy with my game today because it's much better.  My back is much better now. 

 Q.  Do you still feel you can still win? 
 EDUARDO ROMERO:  Oh, yes, of course.  With this wind, it's very hard.  And then you just have to play the back nine and it's very difficult, 16, 17, 18, you never know what will happen.  But I'll be there.  I'll be in the top group.  That's what I want for tomorrow is one more round today. 

 Q.  On 18 it seemed like you were in the fairway on 18, but were you in the wrong place? 
 EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yeah, I was in the rough over there.  And I hit a bad shot, yeah.  It's in the rough.  But, wow, it's a good hole this 18.  It's cost me a lot of money. 
 (Laughter.) 
 But it is okay.  It is my fault.  I make a mistake and then I make a triple bogey yesterday and bogey today.  But I think I want to make birdie tomorrow.  I hope so. 

 Q.  16, 17, and 18, is that one of the toughest stretches of holes? 
 EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yeah, I think it was.  I think 18 is.  18 is the most difficult hole so far this year.  Yeah, but I can't complain.  When you put the ball on the tee, you have to see what happens.  You can make a 7, 8, 3.  You never know.  But you could make double bogey off the tee.  It's a great hole.  Fantastic. 

 Q.  Is this about as hard a wind as you've seen? 
 EDUARDO ROMERO:  No, I think we play with more wind in Europe. 

 Q.  What about in the United States? 
 EDUARDO ROMERO:  In the United States, yes, I think it was -- yeah, yeah, I think it's more difficult to have this wind here.
