  Q. Can you tell me a little bit about how you played today? Obviously you got off to a great start.   
 EDUARDO ROMERO: Well, yes, I played just like yesterday. I played very good yesterday and today. But today I made some more putts.   
 But the course is very difficult with the greens, you know, and the rough, because of that. But I played good. I played good. Better than yesterday, more solid, and then, yeah, just solid. But we have one more round to go and then I'm happy. I'm happy.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like there's a certain shot or maybe a putt that kind of set the tone for the day? Did you get a rhythm going?  
 EDUARDO ROMERO: Yeah, the key today was the putter. Yesterday I didn't putt so good, but today much better. That's why I shoot the score I shoot today. But I'm happy. Now I have to just play another day tomorrow.   
  
  Q. And you're only a little ways off the lead, what do you think you have to do tomorrow?  
 EDUARDO ROMERO: You never know. On this course you never know. You never know what happens. Especially the back nine, and the last three holes, it's very difficult.   
 And then the greens are more harder, more bumpy and then I have to wait, but it's very difficult. It's very difficult to say what the score is going to be today. But I'm okay. I'm done.
