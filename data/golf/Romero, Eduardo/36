Q. Good effort.
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yes, I played well today and I actually had a good chance to win the tournament today. I missed a few short putts on the back nine which might have made the difference but I made a couple of long ones too and that's golf. It was my first tournament on the Seniors Tour and I am happy with the way I played in what were difficult conditions.
Q. What happened on the short putts you missed on the 12th and 13th?
EDUARDO ROMERO:  I think it was a bad read, I tried to hit it straight but the ball moved to the left on both of them, I think I lost a little bit of concentration too.
Q. Did you enjoy your first taste of Senior golf?
EDUARDO ROMERO: Yes, it was very good, especially on this links course. I love playing on links courses and this one was fantastic and especially also the chance to play with players like Tom Kite and Mark James, old friends. I really enjoyed it. It is a different atmosphere to the regular tour, it was a lot more relaxed and I think I will enjoy my time with the Seniors, although I will still play the main tour for a little while yet.
