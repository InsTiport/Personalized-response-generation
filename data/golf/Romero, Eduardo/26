   EDUARDO ROMERO:  It was another difficult day. Typical British Open conditions. I made a couple of mistakes on the back nine, found the bunkers on 13 and 14. If you find the bunkers, you are dead. They're like the rough. You have no chance. Take your bogey. That was a little disappointing, but we still have one round to go and I am still in contention. On days like today, bogeys and double bogeys are common. You just have to stay in there. You have to stay patient. It's very important for tomorrow. If you miss the green or are in the trap, it's very difficult to make the shot, so you must stay patient yes. Will I attack more tomorrow? Well, I'll have to see what happens. But I will hope to start good, get off to a good start, and go from there.
