   EDUARDO ROMERO: Had a good putt for birdie to tie at 7 under but just, well, I heard something, a camera and just lose concentration but it's okay. I made a mistake and it was a tough hole.   
 I make par on 17, good second shot behind the bunkers, but it's okay, it's a good tournament anyway. Finish in the top three, it's a very good week.  
  
  Q. At the beginning of the day were you thinking a number you needed to get to?   
 EDUARDO ROMERO: Oh, yes, yesterday I said that I could win the tournament, and it's true, at 7 under, but it's okay, next time.
