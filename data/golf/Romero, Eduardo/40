GORDON SIMPSON:  We'll not keep you long Eduardo, but obviously Padraig's putter was really what beat you at the end there, yeah?
EDUARDO ROMERO:   I think that it was more my fault too.  I make mistake and I don't putt too good at the last two holes.  Especially on the last one.  I putt from one meter for birdie.  And the course played  -- I played good all week.  Just only two difficult putt holes, it was 18 and the playoff.  But I'm very happy.  My game is very good.  Very solid.  I concentrate and putting is working.  I'm very happy.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Did you think that maybe at the 18th hole the title was yours after Padraig was 20 feet away.
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yeah, well I think so.  I know that Harrington's line is very difficult.  It's too break to go to the left and to come back and it's very difficult to make up.  I say with two putts I win the tournament.  But he make that very difficult putt and then I think I think that was the key for the tournament, that last.
GORDON SIMPSON:  But you still had some great experiences in Scotland this year, winning at Loch Lomond and then second here.
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yeah, I'm very happy with my game and well I play good all year.  The same is the time between the time is I think it was the concentration.  I'm very confident, very relaxing and that's just the result. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Very tough, very tough.  Especially in the match play.  It's the Ryder Cup players, and I think that he is putting very good under the pressure.  18 and the playoff hole I think that he is a great, great champion. 
GORDON SIMPSON:  What about are you, are you going to the Lancome Trophee?
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yes, I go play and then I go home and then go to Italy, Valderama and then to America.
GORDON SIMPSON:  The season has been very successful.
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Fantastic year.  I'm very happy with my season.  It's more than I expect.  I am very happy with this year. 
GORDON SIMPSON:  You say you're going to America.  What are you playing in there?
EDUARDO ROMERO:   Well, I have to go to play the cup, the cup, the SENIOR Tour.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Oh, Warburg Cup.
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yeah.
GORDON SIMPSON:  So you're looking forward to that.
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yeah. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Well I think it's nine on the list. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Oh, yes.  I love to play in that.  Yeah.  I never played in the President's Cup.  No, this is the first time next year that I help. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's very close, yeah.  I like to play that. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
EDUARDO ROMERO:  This morning before the start.  I take the pills, but now it's good.  I don't have the full swing, just half the swing.  But I hit it good.  Yeah. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Especially the way -- well my back is not good, but it is all right. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
EDUARDO ROMERO:  No, just one before the turn.  And then one injection.  Yeah.  In the back.  Yeah.  Right over here (Indicating). 

Q.  How does your yoga, is it good for the back?
EDUARDO ROMERO:  Of course, yeah.  I'm doing yoga three days a week.  But I need some extra help.  I need pills and injection because it wasn't perfect.  The fact that I hit the ball and then I can move again.  It's much better now, much better. 
GORDON SIMPSON:  Eduardo, thank you very much for coming in.  Thank you.
