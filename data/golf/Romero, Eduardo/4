 Q. Just your overall thoughts on how the course was set up and how it was playing today. 
 EDUARDO ROMERO: I finished terrible, I finished bogey, bogey. And 2-under I think that's the score that I have to make today. Before the start of the round you say 3-under today, 2-under would be good. But I finish bogey, bogey. But I play good, I played good all week, and I just have to putt better. My putter is no good. I'm going to change my putter today. But I'm still going to have to make some putts. It is okay. It's one more round to go.

 Q. Your thoughts and your mindset going into Sunday?
 EDUARDO ROMERO: My game is fantastic, except with the putter. But from the tee to the green it's fantastic. It's great. 
 But I have to work a little bit with my putter. I think that tomorrow's a little different day.
