  Q. Talk about the conditions first of all and you also played a lot of holes today.   
 EDUARDO ROMERO: Very tough. Very tough. Very, very tough. And then we had preferred lies, but it was very difficult today. But it is okay, it's the same for everybody.   
 I played great today, fantastic. After nine holes, I made a long putt for par, it was great. And then 18 I made a stupid mistake and make a bogey on 18. But there's two more days to go and I'm very happy with my game. After the ninth hole I played great. Fantastic.   
  
  Q. Were you playing this well coming in? Did you have good vibes coming in this week?  
 EDUARDO ROMERO: Oh, yes, yes. This event for me it's a dream to win this tournament. I win the U.S. Open couple years ago and then I come to this one and this one is a dream. But it's two more rounds to go. I'll be in good shape. I played good, I'm putting good, and then if I do that I'll be good. I'm happy.
