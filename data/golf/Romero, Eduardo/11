 Q. Tough back side. Tell us your emotions. 
 EDUARDO ROMERO: I'm thinking about it. But I make a good par on the 15, and I think it was completely different from there, but anyway, you just have to make it. You can't stop. You can't stop. 
 But it's okay. This tournament is great for me, and finally the day is coming through. 

 Q. We thought on 17 you might aim that second shot at the center of the green, but you went right at the hole. 
 EDUARDO ROMERO: Yes. Of course. My caddy said hit to the flag. I said okay. I'll play it that way.
