EDUARDO ROMERO:  We've definitely given ourselves a chance tomorrow.  We played very solidly today and combined well when we had to.  Maybe this year, we started a bit slower than we did a year ago and missed a lot of chances for birdies in the first couple of rounds, but today was very good.  I think we're among the top groups now.  We couldn't get any putts in to begin with and it was nice to make one on the last from about 12 meters for eagle.  That helps our total greatly.  And tomorrow will be a very different story with the  foursomes.  I think any team from about four or five shots back could possibly win now.  I think we are getting better and better, and maybe we are ready to go one further than we did last year.  We came close to beating the United States and we will be trying our best to do so this time.
