 Q.  Nice way to end.  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Thanks.   
 Q.  Birdie on 18.  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Yeah, good stuff.   
 Q.  What did you feel about your round as a whole today?  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Felt really good.  Been working on a lot of stuff.  Trying to stay more consistent and level-headed throughout the day.   
Felt really calm, patient, and felt like I wasn't overdoing anything.  Hitting a lot of 80% shots, which was very rewarding.   
 Q.  Is that your strategy in general or just a thing...  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: No, that was just today.  Like first time in my life.   
 Q.  Not even in the practice rounds?  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: No even in the practice rounds.   
 Q.  Just like this is what I'm feeling?  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Just kind of woke up today and felt a little different on the range.  Different good.  Just kind of rolled with it.  I was trying to mimic the shots I was hitting on the range all day today.  Couple of them went errant, but seemed to recover really well.   
 Q.  You feeling some good vibes from your win at Tullymore last year?  That's going on this week.  You bring that out here a little bit?  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Yeah, it's fun.  I mean, I don't want to say they're similar courses, but I can see similarities in the shots I need, so that's kind of fun.   
The greens out here are slick and you have to be careful where you're placing the ball.  Yeah and no.  Just it's a new tournament, new year, new D.  Just kind of hanging out.   
 Q.  What's your relationship been like with your caddie?  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Homies.   
 Q.  You guys pretty good friends or what?  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Yeah.  We've known each other for like five years, since I was out on Symetra.  We traveled a lot together last year and stayed in a lot of housing.  She was actually with me in Tullymore when I won.  We were in the same housing.   
She followed me like the last two or three holes.  I was going to have her come out and caddie for me if we had to go to a playoff.  I was in the tent just freaking out.  I was going crazy.  I'm like, I'm not leaving the tent.  I'm not tongue in a wrong scorecard.  I'm staying right here.   
So, yeah, good memories, good times, good friends, good golf.   
 Q.  What's the plan today the rest of the day?  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Going to go work on some tee shots.  I had a couple errant tee shots.  Maybe do an inside-seven-foot putting drill just to get confirmation on what I'm doing and hang out.  Go grab some grub and chill.   
 Q.  Food truck?  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: There is a food truck?   
 Q.  There are several food trucks on the driving range.  
DANIELA IACOBELLI: Let's do it.
