Q. Great round, 3-under around Carnoustie.  You must be really happy with that?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, it was a good one.
Q. How tough was it with the wind being as up as it is?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, it's only been the second time I've played the course.  So I can't really judge how much tougher or easier it is with more or less wind.  For me it was really tough, especially the holes into the wind were tough -- and the ones downwind were tough, too.  Every hole, really, presented its own challenge.
Q. You've played on a few links courses this year in Scotland and Ireland.  What do you make of links golf?  Does it suit your game?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Well, Ireland and Scotland, missed the cut both times.  You might want to think I don't really play well on links courses, but I've had a few good results on links courses at the British Open and a few other tournaments.
I like links golf, yeah.  I'm sure if you think well and stuff like that, it can suit anybody's game, really.  I think my caddie and I, we had good talks before shots and all that stuff, and good strategy, so it worked out today.
Q. Your first Dunhill Links.  How much are you looking forward to this week?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: I only found out a few days, or last week, that I would get an invite, so that was nice.  Yeah, I'm fortunate to play here as an amateur or junior.  I've seen the course, and obviously it's always been a goal to come out and play myself.
Q. You must be happy to be in the mix?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, the round was very good.  I could have made more than two more on the last two, but I had a few putts and stuff like that on the first 15, 16 holes, so I can't really complain.
