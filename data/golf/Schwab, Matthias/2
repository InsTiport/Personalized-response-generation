Q. If we could just get some comments about your round today.
MATTHIAS SCHWAB:   Yeah, today's round was okay.  I got off to a bit of a rough start but kept it together with some nice par saves, and then midway through the round I kind of started hitting it better, made a few birdie putts, and yeah, overall it was a nice day out there today.
Q. This is just your sixth PGA TOUR start.  How have you adjusted to playing on the PGA TOUR?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB:   Yeah, I'm just happy to be here really.  I came to the States a few weeks ago and got a few invites, which was great for me, including this week, and then I'm obviously in the PGA next week, so just happy to be here, and yeah, trying to get used to it.  It's not that much different to the European Tour really, but it's fun being out here, and I enjoy it.
Q. You finished T4 in China earlier this season.  How much of a confidence boost was that for you to have such a high finish at a WGC?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB:   Yeah, it was my first WGC in China a few months ago.  It was a great experience, as well.  It was some good golf, some good putting that week, and yeah, it was nice to see that my game is good enough to play against the top players in the world.  I had a good week after that in Turkey where I lost in a playoff.  Overall it was just a nice experience and a good start to the PGA season.
Q. Do you have experience playing this format?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB:   No.
Q. How have you adjusted to that?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB:   Yeah, I don't really have any experience playing this format, but over in Europe we have a few tournaments that are slightly different formats, so it's nice playing a little different.  I guess birdies and eagles are rewarded more than bogeys are penalized, so you can be more aggressive and just go for more flags, and just, yeah, try and make as many birdies as possible.
