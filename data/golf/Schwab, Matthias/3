Q. Obviously unlucky. How are you feeling?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Well, not too great, obviously. But yeah, it was a close call. I had some good looks and good chances coming down the stretch in regular play, and didn't take advantage of them.
Yeah, in the playoff, it is what it is.
Q. Obviously may take a couple days, but what are the positives you'll take out of this week going ahead?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, I think it's still a second-place finish, which is obviously not too bad, but yeah, at the moment, it's not too great.
