 Q.  Thoughts on a 71 today?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, I got off to a not-so-great start. Didn't really play well all day. I wasn't hitting them great but I made a lot of putts, which kept me in the round. In the end, yeah, I'm pretty happy with my 71 today.   
 Q.  So you have a combined total 6-under going into the weekend. On Monday, would you have taken a Top-10 into the weekend?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Probably, yeah. I usually go into tournaments without any expectations, or at least I try to. So I just try my best and take it as it comes, but I'm glad I'm in the position that I'm in now.   
 Q.  So what's been good? What are you pleased about? What are you taking into the weekend?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Well, yesterday I was hitting them really well and today I wasn't hitting them well but I putted well. We'll see what tomorrow brings.   
 Q.  How is the course shaping up? In commentary, they are saying if they don't water it, it could get a bit fiery. How would you like it to be set up tomorrow, would you like it quicker or happy the way it is now?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Honestly, I have no preference. Really it will be what it will be. It's been pretty tough today. It was a little windier today, I would say, which made it more difficult, but overall, I don't really care what they will set it up like tomorrow.
