Q. First time here, and a great round of golf. Tell us how about it was out there today?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, it was overall a really good day for me. Obviously the 5-under score is not too bad. I was a little bit nervous and tight early on, and missed a few putts, but then on the back nine, on the last five, six holes, I was seeing them really well and made some putts and I'm happy with the day.
Q. We shouldn't be too surprised, should we, it's been coming and some decent rounds and decent finishes recently?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, I guess I'm just trying my best every round. Today was 5-under.
Q. When you go out there, and we see it as a perfect golf course in perfect condition, wonderful place it come and play with the weather is like this?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, you're right, it's a very, very good course in really good conditions. The greens are exceptionally good. And yeah, today we were lucky with no wind. I'm sure with some wind, it can get quite tricky, but today was fun to play.
Q. And WGC experience, tell us about that, what it's like to be involved in a big event like this?
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, for me, it's awesome to be here. I was last player on Race to Dubai to make it in the field, so I guess I got a little bit lucky. Nevertheless, I'm happy to be here and I want to take my chance.
