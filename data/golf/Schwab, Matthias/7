MATTHIAS SCHWAB: I would have taken a 66 going into the day. Got off to a good start. I was hitting the ball much much better today than yesterday, and Friday, too, actually, and made some nice putts on the front nine. On the back nine, it maybe could have been one or two more but I can't complain. It was a good tournament.   
 Q.  You kept giving yourself chances, because there was a couple of putts where you're thinking, you have great momentum; don't be greedy but could have been better?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, of course, could have been better. Looking back, 15, I had a good look. 16, I had a good look. Doesn't matter anymore. It is what it is. It's still a good tournament for me and I'm happy with the result.   
 Q.  Talk about the week as a whole.  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: I was the last one in off The Race to Dubai rankings, so that was a nice bonus for me. Yeah, I was just genuinely happy to be here and had a chance to play against the best players in the world for the first time in my career.   
Yeah, I embrace that and I'm happy that I played quite okay for four days.   
 Q.  And the experience of being in China, tell us about that.  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, China is always very, I would say, interesting. Everything is very, very different to Europe, and Austria, in specific. The fans and spectators are very nice. They like to cheer a lot and they are pretty active, so that's fun. Overall I would like to come back again.
