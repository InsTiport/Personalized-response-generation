 Q.  Thoughts about today's round, please?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, I think it was very similar to yesterday. I wasn't hitting them great at all. Had a nice finish on 18 with an eagle and so overall I'm happy with my round.   
 Q.  Quite nice to finish like that. Gives you a reason to be positive about tomorrow.  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Well, I would have been positive about tomorrow either way. I'm happy to be in this tournament. The finish was probably the best drive of the day, solid iron and nice to finish it off.   
 Q.  Been some low scores out there. Are you aware of what's been going on today, because it was scorable out there, wasn't it?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Honestly, I'm not really aware of what was going on with the other guys. I was very busy trying to keep my game together all day long. But yeah, if you hit the ball well out here, you have a lot of chances. I didn't hit it well but nice to get together a solid score.   
 Q.  Sum up the first three days here. How do you feel about it?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Overall, I came into the week just being happy to have the chance to play here, but obviously I wanted to make the most out of this opportunity. The first round was very good, and second and third rounds, I kept it together quite well. Overall, it's not too bad.
