 Q.  11-under to finish the week off in Italy, probably going to be a couple short but you must overall be happy with the way things have gone?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Yeah, I think overall, it was a really good week for me. Especially today was quite a lot of fun. I was hitting it good again. Was hitting it well all week. Just couldn't get the ball to drop in the hole today on the front nine, especially I had it going a little bit.   
Overall it was a great experience for me here in Rome. I'm happy with how it went.   
 Q.  You seem to be on an upward trend since the middle of the season. Do you feel like the win is close?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: I guess I've come close a few times now. You never know. I'm still trying to figure a few things out. Trying to get better and I hope it will happen eventually.   
 Q.  Looking towards the end of the season now, is there any new goal that you have set or does it just continue the way you're going?  
MATTHIAS SCHWAB: Oh, I just want to continue to get better. Work on a few parts of my game, and then just see where it leads me. Overall I'm pretty happy with how it's been going so far this year, but there's always room for improvement.
