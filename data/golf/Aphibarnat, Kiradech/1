 Q. Three bogeys, three birdies, even par. 3â€‘under par. You're right in striking distance. Your thoughts on the round today, first of all.   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: First of all, I'm happy with the result and even par on this golf course is not easy at all.   
I hit my irons quite well, quite sharp today. But a lot of chance I missed the putts on the greens. I missed the speed I expect, I mean, it's really difficult to change my mindset. I always think these greens are like fast and quick, but after the rain picked up a couple days it slowed the greens down a little bit. So the speed I had to adjust afterwards.   
   
 Q. You talked the other day about seeing yourself in a Green Jacket. I know there's a lot of golf to be played, but you put yourself in a position to really contend this weekend. So your thoughts?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I tried to hit more greens, my iron play was perfect, tee to green was lovely. Just I have to sink more putts and then hopefully that will happen and they will have one my size. We'll see.   
(Laughter.)  
   
 Q. Was the course playing more difficult today?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, the wind is really difficult. It's everywhere, coming from everywhere, so it's quite difficult. The greens being softer made the golf course a little bit easier, I think just for even because the wind picked up sometimes. But overall it's still a really difficult golf course.
