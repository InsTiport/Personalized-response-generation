Q. Rough start and then the big eagle putt on 13, the chip in. What kind of turned around in your game?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I think when the way I started I was just too nervous and couldnt go back to my game. I was trying to adjust to the green speed. The bogey on the third hold was an easy 3‑putt inside 10 feet and putting is my strong game. And after I 3‑putted 8 it was all over and kept thinking that it's not my week again. 
And then the front nine, I was 4-over with 10 more holes to go. Then after 9 I had time to think over myself that the chip, I should have something good, otherwise I don't have, I can't putt in fear in this event. So then I tried to enjoy the golf, tried to enjoy the crowds. The eagle on 13 is a big key turn. I got a lot of confidence back after I chipped in on 15 as well. And 17 was a nice putt. So overall, a little bit struggling beginning, but good finish at the end. Even par opening round is a good start. 

Q. Obviously your first Masters, what were you feeling on that first tee? Was it a little nerve wracking or anything?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I was a little nervous. After three or four holes, you know, I had an easy chip uphill. I don't mind playing the big events, but this event is special, like any tournament, but it was good to come back strong. 

Q. How did you prepare for this tournament? I saw last week you were doing, having a little fun on the lake and stuff, kind of relaxing. Was that the key to it?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I was talking to my coach and he says if you're coming to play a big event I have a lot of pressure on this event, but if you expect too much from yourself, your swing, your body can't accomplish it. So, my focus was just to relax and get ready for this event.
