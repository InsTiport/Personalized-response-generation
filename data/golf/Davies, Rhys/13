   RHYS DAVIES:  It was a great experience. Big galleries and lots of applauding and it was good fun out there. I came here quite open minded and you hit any good shot and the crowd are right behind you and any putt goes in the crowd really appreciate it. That's nice to feel and get involved with.    
  
  Q.  How difficult was it to concentrate?   
 RHYS DAVIES:  You are a little wide-eyed as there is so much going on but on the other hand it is all a blur so you can stick to what you are doing. If there was a roar I backed off but that was about it.   
  
  Q.  How were the conditions?   
 RHYS DAVIES:  The greens were a little softer and that caught me out on the first hole. The last nine, the breeze picked up a bit and you feel a little more nervous today. I am not too disappointed.   
  
  Q.  Tell us about the first birdie you made in major championship golf.   
 RHYS DAVIES:  Made it on the longest hole in major championship golf as well which was nice. Hit it down the fairway and hit a nine iron in for my third to eight feet, downhill left to right and rolled it in. Nice to do that. I parred my second and felt comfortable with that but that birdie helped.   
  
  Q.  Have you changed your thought on what is possible this week?   
 RHYS DAVIES:  I have always thought I could have a good result and I am not getting ahead of myself. Just go out with the same attitude and hope to have another good score.
