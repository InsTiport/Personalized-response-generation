Q. Your second consecutive 69.  How was it?
TREVOR FISHER JNR.: It was good.  I started good.  I started birdie, birdie.  That's always helpful for a nice round.  I just tried to stay steady out there, hit the greens, hit the fairways.  Hit my driver really good these first few days, which puts you in position.
Irons weren't the best.  They weren't close enough, especially wedges in your hand, you want to give yourself a birdie chance.  I felt like I played solid, which was okay, which was nice.
Q. How were conditions?  Bit windier than yesterday.
TREVOR FISHER JNR.: Yeah, it is.  It's quite tough out there.  Especially in the afternoons, the greens, they are not the purest greens, so it's going to be a bit tricky out there this afternoon, but you've just got to give yourself a chance and see if you can't post a low score out there.
Q. Nice playing with Jaco the last two days, how was that?
TREVOR FISHER JNR.: Yeah, it was nice.  I was actually first reserve and S.S.P. pulled out unfortunately and I got in.  Yeah, I was paired with him and Richard.  It was a great two days with him, great guys shot 8- or 9-under.  So he's really playing good, and it's also nice to watch both of them with that lovely rhythm of theirs.
