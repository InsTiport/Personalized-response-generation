  Q. After a rough day yesterday you did a lot better today. What was the difference between yesterday and today?  
 KIM THOMPSON: Well, the weather was a little better, obviously. But it was just hard to focus when it gets going bad on a tough course and tough weather and it's just one of those days.   
  
  Q. Did the altitude affect you quite a bit?  
 KIM THOMPSON: No, I'm from Salt Lake, we're not that much different. That didn't do too much to me. No excuses.   
  
  Q. What can you take away from this tournament?  
 KIM THOMPSON: Oh, it's just fun to come and play. I'm just a club pro, so when I get an opportunity like this, it's fun.   
 But once a year or once every other year, if I'm lucky, that's about all I get.
