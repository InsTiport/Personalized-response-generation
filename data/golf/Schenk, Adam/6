 Q.  So you talked to me Tuesday about kind of playing stress-free golf and playing close to home.  Do you think either of those had a factor on you today?  
ADAM SCHENK: I think being back in the Midwest and playing a golf course that I'm comfortable on definitely made a difference.  I had a really nice round going, but if you would have told me at the start of the day that I was going to shoot 4-under I probably would have taken it and into the teed off.  So that's how I'm going to try and look at this round.   
 Q.  What were you seeing out there that you think you can exploit for tomorrow and the rest of the weekend?  
ADAM SCHENK: Today I drove it really well and then I had good speed on my putts most of the time.  If you can do that for four days, you're going to have a chance to win on Sunday.  And that's what I need to do tomorrow and on the weekend.   
 Q.  A couple weeks ago you said you liked playing tough courses.  Obviously, this one of the toughest courses on the WEB.COM TOUR.  How do you think that helps you today?  
ADAM SCHENK: It is.  Most of the guys, if not all of them, you like to play these kind of golf courses.  If you're playing good, you can still shoot a good number.  But it separates the field a little more.  But it's just fun to play good Midwest golf courses.  The rough isn't as high as I thought it might be, but the greens are fast and it's going to firm up over the week.
