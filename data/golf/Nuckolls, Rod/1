  Q. Tough sledding out there today?  
 ROD NUCKOLLS: Oh, terrible. It was an awful start for me. 45 on the front. And just every hole seemed like something went wrong.   
 And finally righted the ship on the other nine, but still, 37 was, seemed like I played better than that. And came in and added it up to 37.  
  
  Q. Was the weather a factor at all? The wind cause problems?  
 ROD NUCKOLLS: I would like to think so, but it's being that cool you lose a little feel. But it was that cold in the practice rounds and I didn't have this kind of trouble.   
 So I think that the coolness and the pressure, you know, yeah, you added that up together and it was just tough to get going.  
  
  Q. Other than the practice rounds have you played here before?  
 ROD NUCKOLLS: No.   
  
  Q. What's your impression?  
 ROD NUCKOLLS: It's an extremely hard golf course. You just, there's a lot of times you hit good shots and you end up with bogeys. And I hit every shot the way I wanted to and walked off with a bogey on a number of holes.
