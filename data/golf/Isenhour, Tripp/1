 Q.  Okay a few rounds of 8, 3 under 68.  One back.  Couple comments on the day? 
 TRIPP ISENHOUR:  I got off to a slow start.  I wasn't hitting it real close.  And all of a sudden, I miss a -- I don't know, maybe a 7-inch putt on 17. 

 Q.  What happened there? 
 TRIPP ISENHOUR:  Well, there was a bug flying around my head.  And it was just such a short putt, I was just going to tap it in anyway, and I should have backed away.  You learn those lessons. 
 The front I shot 30.  I played really nice, feels good. 

 Q.  Yeah, and you're in great position heading into the weekend.  Do you just stick with what's been working?  Do you change the plan at all? 
 TRIPP ISENHOUR:  Not at all, just keep doing it.  Get the ball on the fairway.  If you're in the fairway, you take advantage of a few of these holes. 
 So you need to take advantage of the par 5's.  You've got two you can reach on the back nine, so you do that, and we'll see what happens on Sunday. 

 Q.  Weather conditions changed at all from yesterday to today? 
 TRIPP ISENHOUR:  We had a perfect day.  We got the good end of the draw.  You know, you get the bad end just as many time as you get the good end.  But it was not windy at all out there today.  And I guess those guys had to play in the wind this morning, so.
