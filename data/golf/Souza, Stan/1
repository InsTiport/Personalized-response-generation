 Q.  Let's talk about the highlights.  Obviously number 4.  So give us the rundown of the hole-in-one.  
STAN SOUZA: That was amazing.  Steve in front of me hit a hard 8-iron and I thought his shot was perfect.  I didn't -- I didn't know that it went over the green.  And so my son is saying, dad, the last thing you want to do is hit it over the green.  I said, okay, I'm going to hit a little soft 7-iron.  And hit it, it was right at the flag, I didn't see it go in, but I heard the crowd go wild and I looked back and my son said, it went in.  I said, you got to be kidding me.   
 Q.  Fantastic.  So your son is caddieing for you this week.  That's got to be special.  
STAN SOUZA: It really is.  So it's the first Major that he's seen dad play in.  I played in the Masters, but he wasn't born then.   
 Q.  And how many hole-in-ones have you had in your lifetime?  
STAN SOUZA: This is number eight.   
 Q.  Number 8.  Okay.  
STAN SOUZA: So the most important one, the most prestigious one.  But, yeah thank you so much.  It was quite a thrill.   
 Q.  Fantastic.  Any other thoughts or comments about the course today or how you played?  
STAN SOUZA: Oh, the course just absolutely ate me alive.  I think I hit only two fairways and you can't do that here.  And it was rough, it was really rough.  I was contemplating on taking one of those seats, because I just got off a hip surgery, a hip replacement, so it was tough walking.  I was gasping for air.   
 Q.  Well, you add altitude to the equation and you certainly, it makes it interesting.  
STAN SOUZA: It was rough, it was rough, but what a thrill.
