Q. So I have to ask, what were your thoughts going into the final day here at Q-Series?
YOUNGIN CHUN: Well, I know I need to play like under par, but I don't want to count how many more do I need. I just, I don't know. I just got first three hole birdie, birdie, birdie, so I was like, okay. It's good.
But still have like 16 or 15 holes left. Yeah, there is possible that I can get bogey, you know. On No. 9, which is 18th, I was in the bunker and I made it, so it was 5-under in the front nine.
I don't want to look at the leaderboard, but I think I have a chance to make it because I was really like close. But I don't want to -- I don't know. I just satisfy for today round.
Q. What was this two-week experience like for you? I know you came through last year as well. What was it like different for you and what you did you learn about yourself through the process?
YOUNGIN CHUN: I play this last year, too. Eight round is like so tired and too much golf. Last year after I finish the Q-Series, honestly, I don't play golf like month after the Q-Series. Then I think I'm going to do that too this year.
Q. So you're ready for a break.
YOUNGIN CHUN: Yes, I am. But it was really fun to play eight round, you know, like over 500 strokes and make new friends. I like this course no matter what. There is lots of good volunteers and good players and good caddies. I love to come back.
But I won't come back.
Q. You had some contention moments on the LPGA. I mean, what you were able to do at Marathon Classic, do you think about those moments, and what will you learn after a year of being an LPGA Tour rookie?
YOUNGIN CHUN: So I played Symetra Tour last year. That helped me a lot to play LPGA. One year LPGA experience -- I mean, it was like goal to my life to play LPGA, right? I just happy to play LPGA and like make my card this year, too.
But help me a lot to play, like good experience.
