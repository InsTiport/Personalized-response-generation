Q. Up at the top after round two.  What's that feel like for you?
YOUNGIN CHUN: Well, I mean, it was fun, but it was too kind of nervous and pressure.  Nobody say I have to win, but, you know, like check every leaderboard.
But I don't know, I'm just trying to focus.  Just put on the green.  Like same as yesterday.  Put on the green, make the par.  But I make some bogey today, but just getting better.
Q. What's that like heading into the weekend knowing you have a true shot at this?
YOUNGIN CHUN: Yes.  Well, I'm just happy for that I don't have to care about the cut.  Because as a rookie, as first year, it was tough because every tournament I have to think about the cut.  It was so stressful.
This weekend, no problem.
Q. You've basically been playing your best golf.
YOUNGIN CHUN: Yes.
Q. What's kind of worked?
YOUNGIN CHUN: I don't know.  I just focus.  Focus about not cut, just my game, my shot every hole, every shot, every putt.
Especially this course.  I don't know, it was tough.  It was tough than yesterday.  I just enjoyed it today.  LPGA was my dream and dreams come true, but I don't have to like pressure or stressful.  Just enjoy the day.
