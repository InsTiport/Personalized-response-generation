Q. A lovely round out there.  Your assessment of the day?
MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, a bit slow to get going and then too busy enjoying the good weather out there.  I think it was beautiful.
Yeah, on the back, just the finish there, really capped off and turned it into a really good round.  Monster putt on the last, a bit of a bonus.  Yeah, it was pretty steady.  Felt like I played actually a little bit better than yesterday and it was nice to get a few putts at the end to justify that.
Q. Your caddie said you rolled in from about 80 feet.  Do you think that's accurate?
MARCUS FRASER: Might have been even further I think.  Probably closer to a hundred.  I holed a good one on 17, as well.  Nice way to finish and make dinner taste a bit nicer, that's for sure.
Q. Three courses down now, going to St. Andrews and early start.  How do you go into that two shots off the lead?
MARCUS FRASER: I feel like I'm pretty relaxed out there, which is rare for me.  I'm enjoying being out there.  I'm loving playing with hairy.  We're having a great time out there together and pumped that we made the Amateur cut I think.
Yeah, we're pretty excited to get in tomorrow and enjoying hanging out with him and having a good laugh, so it's good fun.
