Q.   4‑under inside the Top‑10 of the PGA Championship, I know no one likes finishing with a bogey but you must be pleased?
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, it was good.   The second nine I played pretty good, and just hit a couple of poor tee shots and that's where I made bogey, which you can do on this golf course, miss the fairway, make a bogey.   That's the way it is. 
Putted really well.   Made a couple long ones which really helps, and holed a couple of good putts for par, which you've got to do in these tournaments, and in any round to keep them going.   Yeah, putter has been rolling pretty good, so hopefully that continues over the weekend. 

Q.   Quite a big crowd following you guys for the first 36 holes, but things change a bit when you're inside the Top‑10 in a major.   Have you been in this position heading into the weekend in a major? 
MARCUS FRASER:   I think Hoylake I was there or thereabouts, got a bit of a taste of it then.   Go out there tomorrow and try to keep doing what I'm doing, play the golf course, and hopefully hole a few more putts. 

Q.   How do you think you'll go in the spotlight having had the experience before? 
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, that's why we practice, to be in these situations, so go out there tomorrow and see what we've got, and again Sunday.   Feel like I'm starting to play a little bit better.   Just have to hit the ball a little bit better off the tee than what I did today, and go out there tomorrow. 

Q.   And you seem to have a good relationship with your caddie?
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, I've known Shannon for 25 years now.   We grew up together in a small country town called Corowa.   Very cool that two kids from Corowa are playing a major and having a good laugh, a lot of fun.   He's one of my best mates and he's a great caddie and I'm lucky to have him here this week, that's for sure.
