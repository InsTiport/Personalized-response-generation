  MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, it's always good fun here.   It's definitely one of my favourite weeks of the year.   The golf course is probably my favourite of the entire year, and it's such a good tournament, so hopefully this tournament is going to be on next year.   Not only me but everyone on Tour, it's one of their favourite weeks of the year; hopefully return next year.  
   
 Q.   A good week regardless, but a better week when you finish in the style that you did, a 64 to be right up there prominent on the board.   
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, for sure.   I felt like I played pretty ordinary the last three weeks.   And then my coach came up this week and turned my game around straightaway.   
Nice to be able to do that on the course, as well, and have a really good week.   I couldn't be happier.   It was a big turnaround after the last three weeks, that's for sure.   
   
 Q.   I don't know, is there that slight feeling:   If only I had picked up another one on the third day?  
MARCUS FRASER:   For sure, Thursday, I missed one green and one fairway.   I played really well in that wind and shot 3‑under.   
Then was a little bit up‑and‑down Friday and Saturday, and then played really well again today and managed to make a couple of putts and that was the difference really.   A couple of those putts go in and all of a sudden it adds up to a 64.   
   
 Q.   Your playing partner, Stephen Gallacher.   Said you spurred each other on.   
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, I love playing with him.   He's one of the best guys on Tour.   We've played together quite a bit now and it's nice when you're out there and when you enjoy someone's company, it makes things a lot easier that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   Yet he also made the point that JimÃ©nez had raced ahead, you looked at the board and thought, playing for the lower placings, if you like.  
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, obviously Miguel has taken off a little bit there, 15‑under at the moment, so looks like he's going to run away with it.   
But overall, it's been a really good week and hopefully they can get it together and put this tournament on next year, because a lot of guys will definitely be back, that's for sure.   
   
 Q.   This kind of finish and the money that's accrued is very, very good for the Asian Tour Order of Merit.   
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, for sure.   I knew I had to have a really good week to get back in the mix of things, and hopefully I've done that now.   But yeah, I'm not going to play the two events in Thailand and possibly in Johor, so I think two events in Thailand, I'm pretty sure Thaworn will bank some dollars there and it will be his.   It's been good fun and I've got the minimum events that I've wanted to do and up there or thereabouts on the Money List so hopefully stays there the rest of the year.  
   
 Q.   What are your deliberations?   Do you look at what Thaworn does and reconsider whether to get a last‑minute invite?  
MARCUS FRASER:   Not really.   We've got the Australian Open and the Australian PGA the same week at home and I haven't played any events at home this year.   I really should be going back to Australia and playing some events at home.   I played well there last year so hopefully can do that again this year.
