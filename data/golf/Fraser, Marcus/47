   MARCUS FRASER:  Course is awesome.  Played really steady and a silly 3-putt on the last hole and that was about it.  Three birdies on the par 3s. 

 Q.  You finished 2-over? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  Yeah, so it was good.  Pretty steady sort of day. 

 Q.  How well do you feel as though you know the West Course? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  This is my fourth time.  Feel like I play pretty well here. 

 Q.  Pretty sufficient since Ernie made some changes? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  Yeah, just a couple of tees, no problem getting to the greens really.  The changes are really good I think. 

 Q.  Have you threatened to do well here in the past? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  I played well here a few weeks ago.  Played with Angel Cabrera on a Saturday a few years ago.  He played great and I didn't play all that great. 

 Q.  That's the year he won it? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  Yes.  Managed to fudge my way around and make a few putts and add them up at the end. 

 Q.  The more you come back, the more confidence you get? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  Yeah, any tournament -- 

 Q.  Fits your eye? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  Different things you learn and try and jot those down. 

 Q.  Anything you've worked on or changed? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  No seeing the same coach I used to see, Dennis McKay, saw him probably a couple of months ago. 

 Q.  Still down there is he? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  Yeah, he's still there.  Everything is going pretty good.  I feel like I'm playing a lot better. 

 Q.  What's your schedule in the coming weeks? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  Wales, then go home, hopefully five or six days and head off to U.S. Open. 

 Q.  Can you go through your birdies? 
 MARCUS FRASER:  2, about four feet. 
 6 would be 8-iron back edge and holed a 30-footer. 
 7, hit 8-iron again to three-foot. 
 6-iron to about three feet on 8. 
 3-putted 9. 
 10, hit it to about ten feet with a 6-iron. 
 Then 5-iron to three feet.
