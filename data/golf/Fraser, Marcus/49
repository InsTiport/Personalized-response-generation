MARCUS FRASER:  I played really well. I finished off well yesterday birdieing four of the last five and just sort of carried it into today really. I made a couple of soft bogeys but finished off well birdieing six, seven and eight. Unfortunately did not birdie the nine.

It was quite tough early but towards the end of the day it got a lot easier the wind dropped off a bit and the course was in good nick so it was great.

CanÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t wait for tomorrow. Obviously this is one of our biggest tournaments so to be playing well is obviously a bonus. I am just going to enjoy it.
