Q.   Am I right to assume that's a nice battling performance given the back nine there?
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, a bit of everything there today.   Played some really good golf and some really ordinary golf.   So there was plenty of good in there, could have been anything, and also could have been anything the other way. 
Yeah, one of those days, happy to shoot 3‑under and get out of there.

Q.   You could have been forgiven for thinking it was drifting away and the birdies came on the back nine. 
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, sort of‑‑ as I always do, give myself an absolute hammering, but my caddie said, you know, it's early days in this tournament.   It's only Friday, so head down, and, yeah, all of a sudden made three birdies and got back into contention.   Yeah, it was a good day.

Q.   Sometimes, do you need to give yourself a hammering? 
MARCUS FRASER:   You do, but not as often as I do.   Yeah, I'm probably No. 1 on Tour at giving myself a hammering.   But that's all right, been doing it for a while now, so getting better at it, slightly. 

Q.   Surely it not down to a blasÃ© attitude or any complacency.   You just have to knuckle down and do it. 
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, you have to give yourself a kick in the bum occasionally.   I feel like my game is in good shape.   Wasn't getting rewarded for it for a little while there, and all of a sudden started to make a couple of putts and it all added up 3‑under.

Q.   And the upshot is you're still very nicely placed; third into the weekend is good. 
MARCUS FRASER:   Sure, you want to be amongst it going into the weekend, especially this tournament, it's obviously our biggest tournament of the year, and nice to finish off with a good week here and keep doing what I'm doing and enjoy the weekend.

Q.   Clearly all the focus is on those guys in The Race to Dubai who can actually win and become Europe's No. 1.   Are you as interested and intrigued by that as we are?
MARCUS FRASER:   Sure, we are all Members of this Tour and we all love the Tour.   To have four or five guys in the mix of winning The Race to Dubai, it's pretty exciting. 
You know, Henrik is right up there once again.   I thought he might have enough money by now but obviously not; you know, needs to leave some for the struggling blokes like myself‑‑ no, he's world‑class, isn't he.   No surprise to see him up there.
