 Q.   I take it by and large that's a satisfying start, isn't it?   
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, it's good.   Felt like I played pretty good all day.   Just a couple of silly‑‑ not silly mistakes, just a couple poor swings that let me down.   But, you know, overall, felt like I was in pretty good shape.   I was in good shape last week in Turkey, so followed on this week which is nice.   
   
 Q.   What were the highlights?   
MARCUS FRASER:   Well, the par3s, I had four 2s on the par3s.   Hit the flag on one to a foot and hit it to a foot on one of the other ones.   To play the par3s in 4‑under on this golf course, for someone who hits it my length is pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Suggests the accuracy is there for a start?   
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, came close to holing out a couple times, but yeah, it's definitely not far off.   But yeah, game feels in good shape.   
   
 Q.   Put into context how you've played at this championship in the past, decent performances.   
MARCUS FRASER:   Last year, I was playing okay the first couple of days and had a pretty ordinary weekend.   But I think it's one of those courses that suits everybody.   
Obviously it suits the guys that can hit it quite long off the tee, but it also rewards you if you do play well, which I did today.  
   
 Q.   It's kind of grown over the years, might have been played too early for the very first but it's matured nicely.   
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, it's great out there.   Those greens are perfect out there, not much grain in them.   Course is set up beautifully.   Can't really fault the condition of it, it's great.   
30‑odd degrees, it's always nice playing golf in this weather.   It's good fun.
