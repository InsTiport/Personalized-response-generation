 Q.  One of those occasions where we start at the finish.  Talk us through 18?  
MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, I hit a good drive, and it's always a long hole for me.  About 210 meters straight into the breeze, and 5-wood, and we had no idea where it had gone.  I knew it was going at the flag and as soon as I hit it, I turned and I said, that's perfect, and there was another work in then that's and perfect.  And then all of a sudden there's a lot of carrying on up here, and yeah, walk up there to the front out of the hole and ball was sitting in the bottom, so that was nice.   
 Q.  I gather he said, why didn't you do that on 17.  
MARCUS FRASER: I said, oh, that should be good and it was pretty good.  It was a nice way to finish.  I felt like I played great on the back nine, so it was a good way to finish.   
 Q.  Overall it's a good day to shoot a 65.  You've moved yourself into a good position?  
MARCUS FRASER: For sure.  It's a tough golf course but it's a really tough golf course for me.  I'm obviously one of the shorter hitters here and it's just a long golf course.  I think I shot 29 on the back nine; it's the last golf course I would have expected to shoot 29 for nine holes.  But it was good fun.   
 Q.  I take it it's a bit more approachable today with the sun on your back and the breeze helpful in some places?  
MARCUS FRASER: For sure.  It was cold early but then it sort of gradually warmed up and went from a jumper to having a vest onto just a short.  It was nice towards the end.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts to the final day now?  
MARCUS FRASER: Just go out and play the way I did on the back nine and just play consistent and hopefully hole a few putts and hopefully get a good finish in.
