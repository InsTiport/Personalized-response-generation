 Q. 66, 8-under. 
 MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, it's good. Holed a couple of bombs towards the yesterday's round, played pretty good, dropped a few at the end which is frustrating, pretty tough finish here. 

 Q. What were the bombs yesterday? 
 MARCUS FRASER: In the space of six holes I holed 150 feet of putts, a 20-footer, a 35-footer, a 25-footer and a 40-footer all in the space of five holes, and that sort of got the round going. I was 2-over through ten holes yesterday and holed a putt and off I went, off and racing. 

 Q. A beautiful morning this morning?
 MARCUS FRASER: Didn't realise we were in Scotland this week; the last couple of days it's been beautiful. I don't think it will be like this tomorrow but the course is beautiful. The greens are awesome, as good as it gets, and one of the best places in the world this week when the weather is like this.
 I haven't played well here for a couple of years here, which is a bit of a shame, I haven't played well the last few years full-stop but feel like I've started to play better the last few months. It's always definitely a favourite course for the year. 

 Q. When was your best result? 
 MARCUS FRASER: I think 2004. I was playing really well, and yeah, it was right up there and finished about fifth. It's always nice to play well this week and hopefully stay in it on the weekend. 

 Q. Another incentive, the Open?
 MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, a bit of a lottery, Top-5 I think it is. It's a good start, so you never know, go and play well on the weekend, you're in with a chance.

 Q. Has anyone ever asked you about the origins of your name? 
 MARCUS FRASER: My dad's generation is Scottish and my mom's side are Irish, but just had a little boy six months ago and he's Archie Fraser. That's as Scottish as it gets. Loved the name, suits him I think.
