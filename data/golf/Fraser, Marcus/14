 Q.  Pretty good week for you.  
MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, came out of nowhere, I've been playing rubbish most of this trip, the last three weeks.  It's nice to put in a good week just before I go home.   
 Q.  What did you feel the difference was out there today?  
MARCUS FRASER: I played the same pretty much every day.  Friday I played nicely and bogeyed the last three holes to finish off, and then the putter was pretty cold most of the week to be honest.  I didn't feel like I made my share of putts, apart from a couple of bombs which went in which were a bit lucky.  But felt like I had a lot of chances I didn't take but overall it's a good week.   
It's always nice to top ten and obviously two top fives, hopefully, if I just hold on for a top five.  It's always reassuring if you can have a top five or top ten in these event, with the quality of players that are here, your game is in pretty good shape.
