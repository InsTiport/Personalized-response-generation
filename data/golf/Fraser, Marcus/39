  Q. Seven years since your last win, to win in such a strong field must be very special?  
 MARCUS FRASER: Unbelievable. I can't describe it. Just, I don't know how I did that today. I had so many chances to win in the last seven years. I just don't know.   
  
  Q. Obviously a very emotional win, but at what stage did you think you had this in the bag? You made some great saves in the middle of the round; the birdie on 14 was fantastic. At that point did you think it was your day?  
 MARCUS FRASER: I hit a good shot down there. At no point did I think I had it. I sort of new roughly what was going on but sort of never let myself get ahead of myself, and you know, just get in the fairway down the last and I thought there's no way I'm going for that green, after Tano missed it left and Thongchai missed it after I did, so there was no way I would have had a go at that green with my pathetic length.  
 So, it's unbelievable.   
  
  Q. Is the second one harder than the first one?   
 MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, you know, as I said before, I've had so many chances to win over the last seven years. So go out there and play like I did today and this week, it's a big relief.  
  
  Q. You did it the hard way, you led from day one, that does make it more difficult, doesn't it?   
 MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, for sure. I don't know if I have anything left in me for another day, a fourth rounds but I can't care, I worked my butt off this week and the last few years to be in a position where I should be winning golf tournaments, so it's a huge reward.
