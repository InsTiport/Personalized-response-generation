Q.   What's the verdict, marvelous week?
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, any time Ballantine's are involved, it's always a good week. 
The golf course again was in perfect shape and you know, it obviously played very well this week and came up a little bit short.
But got beaten by some pretty good golf today.   That was pretty impressive, that shot into the playoff hole.   He'd easily agree it's one of the best shots he's ever hit to, what was it, about five or six feet on the par5 to eagle to win a tournament is pretty impressive, so full credit to him.

Q.   And has been pretty impressive by you, as well, a birdie on the playoff hole and a flawless final round and gave yourself a chance. 
MARCUS FRASER:   Yeah, that's all you can do is give yourself chances; hopefully you take them.   Played the playoff hole really well.   Hit the second shot a little bit left and hit a great chip to about a foot.   That wasn't good enough and that's the way it is, that's golf and we are big boys, we'll get over it I'm sure.
