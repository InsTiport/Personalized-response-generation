 Q.  A 68 today, how was it?  
MARCUS FRASER: It was good.  I didn't feel like I played all that well but hung in there and managed.  It was nice, and all of a sudden, sign a 68.  It was a little bit scrappy through the heart but it was okay.   
 Q.  Nice way to finish, birdie on the 9th?  
MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, exactly, it's always nice when those ones go in.  I think it was going four or five feet past.  Nice it caught a bit of the hole and decided to drop.   
 Q.  4-under yesterday, how good was that round?  
MARCUS FRASER: Yeah, that was close to one of the best rounds I think I've played.  Those conditions on Carnoustie, it was probably definitely one of the top 5 rounds I've played.  Even though it was 4-under, it was a great round I think.  It's nice to keep that momentum into tomorrow.   
 Q.  What's the game plan, Kingsbarns tomorrow?  
MARCUS FRASER: I feel like I've been pretty patient the last two days.  Hopefully we get pretty benign conditions and we'll wait and see.  It will be much of the same.  Just try and get it in play and keep out of trouble.
