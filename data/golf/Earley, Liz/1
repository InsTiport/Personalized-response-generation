Q.  (Inaudible)?
LIZ EARLEY: Yeah. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
LIZ EARLEY: No.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
LIZ EARLEY: Oh, no, that's okay.  For me it seems like I start off really well and it makes my week a lot easier than having to worry about playing good the second day.  I'm quite pleased.  This is probably one of my better rounds for the entire year.  Putting quite well, and the greens are pretty quick today, and it's just one of those things, if you hit it in the right spot, it makes a big difference. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
LIZ EARLEY: I think it's just part of golf.  I feel comfortable on this golf course.  It's one of my favorite courses that we play in the LPGA.  I can hit a lot of 3-woods off the tee to set myself up for shorter shots in.  It's just suits my game really well.  
The other thing is  -- I put an 11-wood in my bag, and I hit it about six times today.  I literally hit it about six times today.  It made a lot of difference.  I'm calling it my new favorite club.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
LIZ EARLEY: It just takes the place of most people's 4-iron or 5-iron.  On some of these greens, with the slope of them, you really want to bring it in as high as you can.  It stops on the greens instead of bouncing towards the back.

Q.  (Inaudible)?
LIZ EARLEY: It's been in the bag since Youngstown, so four weeks.  I didn't even bring my 4-iron this week.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.
