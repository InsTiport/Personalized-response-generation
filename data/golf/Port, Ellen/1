 Q.  Just a reaction to your week here.  
ELLEN PORT: Yeah, just a good week.  I didn't make any putts all week, and it carried on to this match.  That was the difference.  I missed a couple shots, but she even putted well, and I had my opportunities, so I'm disappointed in that because -- but that was kind of what it was.  Great week, great venue.  I think it's probably one of the best championship, I think, tests.  The rough is worse than some U.S. Opens I've played in.  The Bermuda is very difficult, so if you miss some fairways you're in trouble.  But great week.   
 Q.  Quick turnaround before the Senior Women's Amateur.  What do you take out of this?  
ELLEN PORT: I take out of it that I always learn about three things.  I got down early and I was just thinking too much about the match instead of old man par, and I think I would have made the putts I missed, the short ones for birdie and to save par, if I hadn't thought it was match play.  It's good to come right off of a tournament because a lot of amateurs, including myself, I have long gaps before I play.  So it was a reminder of how you need to play if you want to win.
