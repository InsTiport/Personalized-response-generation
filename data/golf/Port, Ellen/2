Q. You are likely to be playing some golf tomorrow.
ELLEN PORT: Maybe.
Q. Oldest to make the cut since Anne Sander.
ELLEN PORT: I wondered if Anne made it.
Q. 56 she made it.  You guys are 22 days apart birthdays.  She's August 31st and you're September 21st.
ELLEN PORT: So she's older.
Q. How far was the birdie putt on the last hole?
ELLEN PORT: Six feet.
Q. What did you hit in there?
ELLEN PORT: 4 hybrid with a really bad drive.  I was like, I'm not hitting a 5-wood because I hit a bad 5-wood into the pond at 6.  I got real quick and yanked it.
Q. When is the last time you made a cut in a Women's Am?
ELLEN PORT: Good question.  Early 2000s.  I used to always make the cut.
Q. I saw your name in a few brackets.
ELLEN PORT: But I never played well.  I've never played that great in the U.S. Amateur.  I just always feel like -- you want to play so well and sometimes you want to do well, my game just didn't show up that week --
Q. It showed up this week.
ELLEN PORT: Well, I worked hard.  I made some putts and I kept it in front.  Calm, cool and collected was just my mojo because I've struggled a little and I've had to scramble, but I did some good things.  You know, 72-71.
Q. Can you imagine if somebody sees you tomorrow and they're in the first --
ELLEN PORT: Well, I've got to get my driver working.  Everybody says there's strengths and weaknesses and know what you do well and what you can do better.  So I still have some things I can do better.  That's the good news.  I'm doing some good things, but there's a few things I can still do better.  I didn't get too tired -- I was worried about how I would hold up.  So I just want to rest a little bit and --
Q. Congratulations.
ELLEN PORT: Thank you.
