 Q.   Thoughts on shoot being 4‑under par, a lot of drama involved in that today?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It's actually three.   A little frustrating over the last couple holes, I missed stupidly a couple of short putts.   It's frustrating because I really had the course by the neck, and I don't really shoot the number that I deserve, so I'm probably going to head out straight to the putting green.  
   
 Q.   Birdie after birdie, so many opportunities.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, played really good all day.   I was just in control and I was hitting good shots.   I was feeling nicely along the way.   I've always liked this place.   I've always thought that it suits my game; it suits the way I play golf.   So it's not a surprise‑‑ well, it's never a surprise when I play well here I think.  
   
 Q.   I gather you had many driver in your bag today?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I've not really been hitting the driver that well lately.   And out here, it's not a course where I need to hit it out of my boots.   And Callaway made this new mini driver thing that goes quite a long way, so it works perfectly for this course.  
   
 Q.   Looks a bit more like a 3‑wood and it affects in similar fashion?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It's probably a 2‑wood on steroids.   It's a pretty good club, and I'm glad I have it in the bag this week.  
   
 Q.   Presumably despite the misgivings today, that's a nice score to get the foundation after some ‑‑ not the best of form from you.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, it's always a good start.   So yeah, I'd like to build from it, keep the same MoJo in the next couple of days.   I mean, I thought I played really well and if I keep going like this and not throw these opportunities out the window, it would look pretty good.
