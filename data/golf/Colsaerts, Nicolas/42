 Q.   6 & 5, seems like you're only playing half the course?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     We played well today.   It wasn't easy.   It was very breezy at times and I think we managed to make a lot of birdies, which is of course the key in fourballs.  
   
 Q.   And 43 stroke for 13 holes, that's pretty good golf, isn't it, even around here?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Like Gonzalo said, we played very well, we completed each other in a very nice way, great timing and a few good putts that dropped at the right time and kept us ahead in the right momentum.  
   
 Q.   Why were you put out late or the last out today?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     Because we like to sleep (laughing).   We are a bit lazy, we like the Sunday lates, but we got one today on Friday which is pretty nice.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever played foursomes together, and are we likely to see you tomorrow on Saturday?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   We have never, no.   We didn't even play four‑balls together.   This was our first shot at it.   Seems to be working quite well.   Obviously foursomes is a very different format, but the way we've been playing the last two days, there's no reason we can't get away with it in foursomes.  
  
 Q.   Do you want to play again tomorrow?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I would love to play with Nicolas again.   I think we have good fun at the course, and that is what team golf is about.   You need to enjoy yourself and enjoy the company of whoever you're playing, and that's exactly what we're doing.  
   
 Q.   Well, this week, it's a case of chocolate and Rioja blending perfectly.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Or chocolate and chorizos.
