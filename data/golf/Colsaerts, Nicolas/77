Q.   A round with it's share of up‑and‑downs, how do you feel about the play today?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I'm a little disappointed.   I started very, very good. I was feeling very well, and then I went through a difficult patch, 8, 9, 10, and then finished again in a pretty good fashion, even though I thought, I didn't really have my share of putts, I shaved a lot of holes, burned some edges, which maybe would have put me in a better position. 

Q.   Five or six behind as we speak, how do you approach tomorrow's final round with the objective of winning the tournament or second to get in The Ryder Cup? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, as much as everybody knows, we are just going to take on pins and try to can everything.   We are going to have no choice.   But then, I still showed passion, I still showed that I play with my guts, and you know, I'm just fighting like a dog. 

Q.   If it doesn't work out and you need a pick, do you think your play tomorrow is relevant?   Do you think it matters? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Hard to say.   I have no clue.   It's very difficult.   I mean, you can look at so many different scenarios.   I have no idea what I need to do tomorrow‑‑ my strategy is to shoot the best round of my career, plain and simple.

Q.   If none of the other contenders win, do you expect to be picked? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   But then again, who am I to say so.   I think I'm just going to answer the same way I've been since I've been in this position.   I think I've made a lot to show that I was keen to be part of the team and that I could bring some.   But then it's down to just one person to decide.

Q.   Will you be watching the PGA TOUR tonight? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, maybe a little bit.   The usual. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I think I had 144 metres to the front, so you're going to have 160 yards to the front.

Q.   What did you hit? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I hit an 8‑iron but pitched probably about a foot too far left. 

Q.   When you say you're fighting like a dog, are you fighting like a dog every week, or is this different?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   No, this is different.   I mean, you know that every shot is worth so much more.   It might be stupid to think like that, but you know, it is. 

Q.   Are you going to be relieved to get tomorrow over and done with?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I don't think the leaf is going to be over until the announcement, pure and simple.   So I have some fly fishing set up Monday morning to think about something else.
