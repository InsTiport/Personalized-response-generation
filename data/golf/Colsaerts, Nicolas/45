 Q.   Nicolas, kind of a tale of two nines.   Three birdies, three bogeys as you make the turn, but a nice finish.   A birdie at 7 and 9, come in at 2 under.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, finished a pretty good back nine, which was my front.   Congressional is a very tough golf course.   Even just now, it's almost like the U.S. Open setup.   
So coming off that nice performance two weeks ago, I try to do exactly the same thing I did over there, meaning grinding a bit and just make sure that I was just hitting the right shots.  
   
 Q.   11 of 18 greens today.   So that meant you were scrambling around, making a lot of good up and downs.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I made a couple of good ones.   It's pretty nice when you kind of grind it like that and you make a few up and downs that are pretty spicy.   That keeps the momentum of the round going.   Anything under par today, I think, is pretty good golf.   
Those three up and downs are probably what made the difference.  
   
 Q.   Compare this setup with what you had two years ago.   You played The Open here.   You didn't play in this tournament last year.   You missed the cut at The Open here in 2011.   Any similarities, differences?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I think it's pretty much the same.   The rough is pretty brutal.   You can't really get anything more than a 7 iron out of the rough on the average lie.   I'm sure on TV, you can see it jump out and get back on the fairway.   
The greens are probably a lot more receptive than they were at the U.S. Open.   That's probably the only thing in our favor at this time.   But apart from that, the course is pretty much the same.  
   
 Q.   Good start.   Thanks for talking with us.   Good luck the rest of the week.
