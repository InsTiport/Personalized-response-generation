  PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, our first two matches the American boys have putted much better than we had.   Turned around today just at the right time to hole the putts.   Last time in Wales I think it was the other way around.   It all comes down to putting in this tournament, like most of the golf is, and today again, made a couple of good putts, and Dustin made a good one on 17.   It was great fun playing with Nicolas, just a pleasure to play with.

Q.   Nicolas, you hit the hole so many times and they just wouldn't go in. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, most of them were a little hard, so yeah, I mean, they looked good, a few horseshoed and a few could have dropped.   Yes, it's very frustrating because there was a lot of putts that looked very good and you don't make them.   So yeah, it's kind of painful, yeah. 

Q.   Nicolas, you fought so, so hard during that match.   That is Ryder Cup at its absolute best, but at the end it's a really devastating defeat, isn't it? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I thought Paul did a wonderful job on the last couple of holes, a few birdies and a few very good moves.   Unfortunately I didn't really make some of the putts that would have made a bit of a difference, and then Dustin holes one from nowhere on 17 to save the day. 

Q.   The story of Ryder Cup is them holing putts and Europe not making the ones they needed to? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   It's all about putting.   Ryder Cup always has been.   All the players are top players, world class players.   We can all play, it's just a matter of who holes the putts, and today the American boys holed the putts at the right time.

Q.   The Americans have got a big, big lead, but you have to steel yourselves and believe, believe you can turn it around? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   We need to make something here out of the last couple of games.   There's still 12 singles matches tomorrow.   We can all win tomorrow, and why not?   It's certainly not over.   It would be nice to make a big comeback tomorrow, so we'll see what happens.

Q.   Nicolas, do you feel raring to go for singles and trying to grab a valuable point for Europe tomorrow? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   More than ever after today. 

Q.   Paul, in 1999 at Brookline you were obviously in that team, 10‑6 Europe led at that point, you saw America overturn that result.   It's possible.   How likely is it that you can steel yourselves in order to produce something similar? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   It's always possible.   Until it's impossible to do it, then you fight on, certainly for JosÃ© MarÃ­a this week.   No one is going to be giving up.   There's 12 matches left tomorrow.   There's a couple of matches left out there.   We need to sort of make sure we make a point or two if we can, and then tomorrow everyone gives it their all and you never know what can happen.
