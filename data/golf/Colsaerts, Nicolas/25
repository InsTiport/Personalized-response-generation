Q. What do you make of a bogey-free round of 68 around Le Golf National?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Well, for starters, any time you play under par on this course, you have done a lot of pretty good things.  But when you go bogey-free on a pretty windy day, the ball doesn't really travel that much when you play cross and into winds like this; it's not like it's 30 degrees.  It's a pretty good feeling.
Q. So this is one of your best around here, is it?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, I mean, I've played this place millions of times, but it's so demanding that it's difficult to do a round without a mistake.  I've never really made performances as well as I think I know this place.  But when everything clicks together, you can shoot a decent score.
Q. So how did you manage it today?  Did you make sure of hitting the fairways?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Well, of course, yeah, hitting the fairways is kind of a bonus, but on certain occasions, I don't really care.  Holes like 4 today, I can just bust a long way there and give myself a short thing in.  But yeah, there are holes where you have to hit the fairway if you want to have a good chance of giving yourself a chance for birdie or a smooth par.
Q. Look at the leaderboard now and you're in a lovely position, aren't you?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, but it's such a demanding golf course that you can have nine holes to go and anything can happen.  So 36 makes it even more complicated.
But I would like to stay in the same kind of mood.  It was very unstressful today.  I played really well.  I hit a lot of greens.  I made a few good up-and-downs at the end and kept it all together and a good birdie to finish with, so comes out like a two-shot swing, which can happen very quickly in this place.
