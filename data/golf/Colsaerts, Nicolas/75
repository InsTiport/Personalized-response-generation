Q.   Obviously not the round you were hoping for but is there some sense of relief it's over now and what will be, will be?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Kind of.   It's been a very long summer.   I've only taken one week off in the last nine weeks, just because I want it badly.   So it's been a pretty long time, head down, and so I'm quite relieved I'm going to get some days to chill out.

Q.   Mentally as much exhausted as physically imagine? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   More mentally than physically.   If somebody asked me to play 18 tomorrow, I would probably go.   But I'm just mentally pretty tired.

Q.   You've made you've made a strong case, you're The World Match Play champion, you've had nine top nines this year, and no one in the world has had more.   You must feel good about your chances. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, just said it all.   Yeah, of course.   The situation has not really changed and nobody really made a statement big enough, I think, to get in front of me in some of the rankings and everything.   So, yeah, I'd like to think that I'm still in a pretty good position. 

Q.   Would you describe yourself as nervous or confident? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Nervously confident. 

Q.   Where will you be tomorrow when the announcement is made?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I'm going to be here at the house where I stayed.   I was supposed to play 11 o'clock so I was going to be on the plane when the announcement was made, so I changed my flight plans just to sit in front of the telly and watch it life.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I played pretty good all week.   I had absolutely nothing going my way.   If I only had‑‑ I would have probably played for an automatic spot in, but it's been a very long summer for me.   So I'm kind of tired and glad it's over now.

Q.   Played well throughout the season.   How much pressure do you think you were able to put up on Jose Maria OlazÃ¡bal for tomorrow's pick? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I would like to think as much as I can.   I thought I did everything I could to show that I was capable of delivering and being in a situation where he was going to have no choice. 

Q.   Are you going to be at the announcement tomorrow?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I'm going to be here.   I'm staying right next door.   I've changed my flight plans just to make sure I was going to watch it on the television live.
