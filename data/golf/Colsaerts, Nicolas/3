Q. You started the day tied for the lead, ended it with a three-shot lead. How pleased with your day's work?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Very pleased. I wasn't really looking at what the lead was or where I -- I mean, kind of knew, but I didn't really pay much attention.
I'm a bit on a mission. I have a lot to play for. It's not like actually winning this tournament is at the forefront of my mind. I still have to play shots. It got a little bit easier at the end but it's a difficult course to play. If you just lose a little bit of focus, which I think if I looked at the leaderboard and everything, I might do. I made sure I stayed out.
Q. We chatted mid-round, and you said you were feeling very much in control of your game. How well do you feel you're swinging?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: I'm in control of a lot of things, my striking, my emotions, for whatever reason I can't tell you, it's not as busy as it is in June. My thing is that I can hear French in the crowd, so I normally kind of have to play with earplugs a little bit, but so far it's been pretty good.
Q. Your thoughts on tomorrow, a chance to win for the third time on The European Tour, but this one is such an historic championship, one of the oldest in the world.
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Of course, don't get me wrong, it would be amazing to win this thing. But like I said, if I stay away from thinking that, I think my chances will be a lot higher than if I see this thing right in front of me.
