Q.   There was a situation‑‑ your thoughts‑‑ inaudible. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, you don't know what to think because it never happens, you never have to take a drop into a toilet, it's never been seen before.   I'm sure I'm going to make the news and I'm going to make every sports journal everywhere in the world just because I took a drop in the toilet.   It looked stupid but it was the rules and I had to play it that way. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, we have the biggest tournament of the year next week, Wentworth, PGA Championship, so it's one of the big weeks of the year, so I guess‑‑ well, I hope I'm going to keep going and play better than this week.
