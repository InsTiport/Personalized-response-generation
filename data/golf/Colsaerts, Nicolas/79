  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Thanks for joining us again, hopefully the second of five appearances in the media centre this week.   Start us with assessment, obviously good day for you?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yes, it was.   It was exactly the day that I wanted, being in control of what I was doing.   A bit of a shaky start and then I found my rhythm again, made a couple birdies in a row and then was in control of my ball, which is what I wanted in these conditions.   
So I'm very pleased with how I handled myself on a day to set up with the week good fashion.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Able to refocus after your shaky start?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, wherever you play, it's little different, you play in Europe, you play in America, you're still finding out where you are and what sort of game these conditions ask.   You know, making a quick recovery after the bogey sort of probably woke me up a little, which was good.   
   
 Q.   Tell us what your sleep pattern has been like the past few days coming over from America.   Have you slept much at all in have you slept well?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I usually sleep a lot.   I don't really need to sleep much at night, but I can divide it up into segments, which I'm good at, we like to call them power naps but just serious naps.   The first day I got here, I got in in the morning, stayed awake all day, and then you know slept a little bit before dinner and then I took my bit of time to go to sleep that particular night.   But that night I was in bed by 9.30.   
   
 Q.   You also said yesterday Thomas BjÃ¶rn might say the odd thing about The Ryder Cup; any conversation about that?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Of course not.   I mean, he's trying to win the tournament.   I thought about this on the course, I'm playing with Thomas, vice captain, fine, but he's trying to defend his title, as well.   He's got a lot on his shoulders as well.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel more tension than you usually do?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   No, absolutely none.   I was feeling very good.   Like I said, I had a good night's sleep, and you know, this is‑‑ I've been coming to this place for so many years, that it's a place I'm very comfortable at.   I know I didn't feel the nerves at all.   It's still a very long week, so even you get off to a start like that, there's still so many stories that could be unfold during the round or during any days or during the whole week.   So there was no reason to be nervous.   
   
 Q.   Was it difficult getting used to the different conditions after the last few weeks?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, actually, it's funny, because the more I prepare myself for tournaments, the more it sort of adds pressure.   So only playing the Pro‑Am and landing here Tuesday morning was actually very good for me to get straight at it.   I only had like one decent look at the course and was just going to make sure that I do everything in one go.   
But yeah, it's certainly a lot different.   The fairways are very, very soft and wet.   So hitting the ball is way different than what I did last week, but that's the thing about Europe; I think we play in different conditions and we adapt very quick.   
   
 Q.   Are you interested in what's going on in America?   Do you see a relevance in how the players are doing over there?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Regards of?   
   
 Q.   Do you need a wild card?   Do you see yourself having rivals for that?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, of course, I'm not the only one on the list, but what can I do.   The only thing I can do is like I did today; I can only be in control of what I do and worry about myself.   I'm always going to keep an eye on what's going on because I do it all the time regardless of the situation I'm in, because I like to know what's going on.   I live on this tour, so I like to see what's going on in other people's lives.   
   
 Q.   Will you watch it?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I'll watch a bit, but it's not like I'm going to get crazy if somebody shoots 60.   But I'll just keep an eye like I usually do, yeah.   I'm not going to change what I do just because‑‑ like I said, I can only worry about myself.   If I do good, you know, it should be good.   
   
 Q.   You ve got a lot of time to kill this afternoon so will you watch the golf?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, but I actually had my first lesson of fly fishing yesterday.   So that's going to kill time this week a little bit.   I actually quite enjoyed it.   So it could be a little passion of mine.  
   
 Q.   Where?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   At a little pond in the garden of where I'm staying.   They had a little pond and I was just introduced to fly fishing yesterday by a friend of the family.   
I didn't catch anything but the other guy did right in front of me.   But it was good to have a go myself.  
   
 Q.   Was it big?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Just a little one.   
   
 Q.   What do you see apart from long hitting as the strength of your game?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, I think my iron play is always pretty good.   I tend to hit a fair bit of greens in reg during any day.   
And then my putting is starting to get better.   I've been working with Dave Stockton.   It certainly helped me to all those‑‑ hole a lot more putts inside 12, 15 feet, which I didn't really do much in the past.   If my iron game is there, I'm always going to create myself a lot of chances for birdies on any given day, which is something pretty good.   
   
 Q.   How long have you been working with Dave Stockton?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It's been since over two years I think.   It's changed the way I putt the ball tremendously.   I can look down at some putts and feel confident I'm going to make a lot more than I did in the past.   
   
 Q.   Would it give you more pride if you got to play your way into this Ryder Cup Team this weekend, or is making The Ryder Cup‑‑  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Of course it would.   When you play‑‑ when you get yourself in this position, you were in, and you were out, and back in, and I'm on the limit; it would obviously make me‑‑ for my first one, it would make me very, very proud to get it down to the wire like that at the end and get myself into an automatic spot.     Obviously the big goal is playing, but if I can get myself in automatically, it would be quite a big boost for me.  
   
 Q.   Would it almost make you feel as if you belong ‑‑ to go in and earn an automatic spot?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   That's a tough one.   I think I do, in a way.   I think the way I've been playing the last year or so, year and a half, I feel okay in his company.   I'm fine.   As much as I did at the U.S. Open and as much as I did at The Open this year, even though I had a slump in the middle of the week, I know that on any given day, I can take anybody, which is why I've done so well in match‑play events.   
But then again, yeah, it will probably make a little bit of a difference.   But for me, if I go in the week, if I get into The Ryder Cup automatically, it will give me quite a big confidence boost.   But you know, we are not there yet.   There's still a long way to go and I'm not in right now, so we shouldn't even be discussing it.   
   
 Q.   Are you aware that if the qualification system is as it was last time, you would actually be on the team now?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Oh, yeah?   Does everyone know that?   (Laughter) No, I didn't know.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, well, I'm not.  
   
 Q.   Have you played with anybody at any level who is longer than you?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, there's the odd one, but if I get asked so many times, like who is longer, you or Alvaro‑‑ when you start looking at distances‑‑ sometimes you have the right trajectory and the right bounce.   So it's difficult to say who is longer than the other one.   But I rarely played with someone who has shorter irons than me from the same spot.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever entered a long drive competition?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Oh, no, it's still a different world than these guys ‑‑ we are nowhere near.   
   
 Q.   Is it only recently you have begun hitting it miles?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   No, I was always quite long.   The equipment has changed so much; it's a lot easier now to hit it further.   So I guess I'll find something that works.   But I was never short; let's put it that way.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Thanks for joining us.
