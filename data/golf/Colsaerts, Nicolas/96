Q.   In these difficult conditions, how good a round, therefore, was that?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Pretty good.   It could have been a lot better, actually.   I missed a few chances, three putted once when it was only 120 meters from the flag after a huge drive. 
But in and out I holed a pretty good one for par on 8, which was my 17, so it's not bad.   Considering the wind and everything, I think it's a pretty decent round of golf.

Q.   So what time was the alarm called, because probably you got here in the dark, and it was flat calm, and then it just deteriorated?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Is there such a thing as flat calm in here?   I'm not quite sure. 
No, 5:00 this morning, yeah, so a bit of a rush to get here and just make sure we were ready, but yeah, it's pretty early when you're here at the golf course at 5:30.
