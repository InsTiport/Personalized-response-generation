  NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I didn't get off to the best of starts, and when you're 4 down against somebody like Kuchar who uses his putter very well on the greens‑‑  
   
 Q.   He made quite a few important sort of 10 to 15 footers.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   But there's a great chance for him to make them.   So it was me; I didn't do good on anything else other than par‑5s.   And he's pretty good at wedges, as well, so you know he's going to have birdie chances at those, too.   
If you look at the middle part of the round, it's pretty much even.   It's just early on I gave a couple holes too easily and found it pretty tough to come back.  
   
 Q.   Overall week?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It was pretty good, up until‑‑ I mean, I knewthis was the format I was hoping for to kick off my season because I've played pretty good the last couple weeks, but there I didn't get anything out of it.   This was a perfect way to kick it off.   Of course I wish I could have gone a bit further, which was totally up my street.
