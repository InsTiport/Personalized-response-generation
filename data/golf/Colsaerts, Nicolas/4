 Q.  How did you feel about that today?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Very good obviously. It was really hard when we started the. The front nine was pretty difficult. It was blowing pretty hard. Slightly different direction than yesterday. Then it sort of calmed down a little bit on the back nine.   
Made a few long putts that kind of gave me momentum into the back nine, which was nice, and then free flowing the rest. So yeah, pretty happy with the way I ended these first two rounds.   
 Q.  Five birdies in six on the back nine now, doesn't strike us watching, as the sort of golf course that gives you runs of birdie opportunities. For you out there, do you feel it sort of plays with the way that you play and your game, that you can get on a bit of a run?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, I mean, it's just like every golf course. If you play the right shots, you can get it close and you can make birdies.   
It's not -- they have moved a few tees forward, rightfully so, and it's not super, super long. Like I said, if you find the fairways, which are a little bit easier to find than when we come in June, the greens are a bit tender; if you play the right shots, you can get close. Hoping for not more or a similar wind than we had this morning because it was pretty tough.   
 Q.  The attitude for the weekend, is it play on the front foot or play conservatively? What's the key over the weekend when you're in great shape the way you are?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Like I said, I think it will depend on the conditions. It not a golf course that you can go and sort of get in attack mode 100 per cent of the time. It depends on the tee shots, which direction and that kind of stuff. You can take a chance and try to take advantage on some of the holes. You have to choose them right I guess.
