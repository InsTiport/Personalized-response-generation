  NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I feel like I was down in the match all day.   Even though I was up with a couple of holes to go, it didn't really make a difference.   A little disappointed losing the last. 

Q.   How about the chip on the last? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, we were using the bank and just drove it. 

Q.   What's difference about this event? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Well, you have one person you're staying instead of the field and you don't have to worry about making big numbers, you only lose a hole. 
I think a halve was a good result and between the two of us, we made a lot of birdies. 

Q.   You played well last year, were you feeding off those memories and is this one you were looking forward to playing? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, you go back to a place you played well, you have very fond memories.   It took me awhile to get going today, just before the back nine, so felt good. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I think both of us at the end of the day, a halve is probably a good result.   He made a good come back there and had to make the putt on 17 just to stay in the match, so at the end, I felt it was good but if you asked me on No. 12‑‑ that was one of those sort of games.   I think both of us played good golf. 
I've been on holiday and arrive been practicing, so those are the sort of shots I was visualising back home, and it was nice to use them when I needed to. 

Q.   Still rust in the system that you can only get out of the way through competition?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I felt like I hit a few loose iron shots on the par3s but other than that I thought I played pretty decent.   I was pleased with the way I putted. 
It's always nice to play match play.   It's such a different format to what we play week‑in, week‑out.   You have the one guy that you have to beat and it's a good challenge.
