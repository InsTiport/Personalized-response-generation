Q.   66 yesterday, 68 today, which round gave you more pleasure?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Probably yesterday.   You know, yesterday was all smooth and nothing really happened, and today was a bit of both.   I started off very nicely, and two silly mistakes down the middle, two bogeys that I could easily avoid, and then shaved a bunch of holes on the back nine.   Nice little gesture on the last.

Q.   I was going to suggest that perhaps today gave you more pleasure because you stayed patient on the back nine. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I was very, very close of losing it because I thought I was playing quite well and I was playing quite solidly except for those two holes where I bogeyed.   But apart from that, yeah, I'm quite pleased with the way I'm playing.   I thought it looked pretty solid.

Q.   447 off 18 today; today, how far?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   110 yards shorter. 

Q.   You're just like a powder puffer now; you're just like everybody else. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, yesterday was a bit of a treat.   I thought I got a good bounce and it speed trapped on the right side of the fairway.   I think no one ever is going to hit a drive that long on that hole again (laughing).

Q.   So your second yardage was what? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yesterday I had 130 yards and today I probably had like 245.

Q.   Still finished with an eagle?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, well, it didn't look that easy, big sloping putt and luckily it caught the hole.   But I shaved a few earlier, and I thought I was due a little help. 

Q.   A little lift? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, kind of. 

Q.   Going into the weekend, what do you think now? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, I'm quite happy with the way I'm playing.   For whatever reason, I've always played well here.   It rewards good ballâ€‘striking which is what my game is all about.   If you hit a lot of greens and if you can get it quite close on certain occasions, you're going to give yourself very good looks at birdies, which I did the last two days.
