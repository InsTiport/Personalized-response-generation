 Q.   You're still smiling.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:     Well, yeah, I thought I played pretty well.   I didn't start in the best of fashion again, I had a jumpy start and then get right back in it.   I hit very good shots, made one or two very good putts, made a good save on 16 where I should be reaching a par 5 in two.   
And then 18, I just thought I would give it a go and probably hit like a hopeless shot from the first over the grandstands, hit a wonderful chip.   
   
 Q.   You did give it such a good go, because you were in No Man's Land, and then entirely on the wrong fairway, a wonderful chip?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It would have been a good story, yeah, but I'm sure there's going to be much more to come.  
   
 Q.   You seem to have taken that with equanimity right on the shoulders.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It's the first week of the year.   This is as good as it gets really, playing the last group, major champions at your tail.   It's very exciting.   
   
 Q.   I take it you're proud of your performance across the week, some scintillating golf thrown in.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I'm sure they are going to remember me, first round very good, and then hitting the grand stands and everything else.   I don't want to be such an entertainer all my career I hope.
