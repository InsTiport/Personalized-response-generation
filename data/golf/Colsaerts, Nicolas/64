Q.   Nicolas, 6‑under par today; no bogeys on the card.   Great start. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I played pretty good.   I had a lot of very good shots early out.   Quickly under par. 
A bit sloppy in the middle, but just made sure I did my pars, couple good up and downs and couple good birdies to finish with, which posted a good score.

Q.   Take us through the birdies, 15 and 18 I guess it was. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, 15 I could have gone for the green and decided not to because I wasn't really hitting the shots at that time.   Got it up and down from 100 yards. 
Then pretty good drive on 18 and only like 110 yards for the pin and hit a good shot probably to like, yeah, six, seven, eight feet, something like that, and holed it.

Q.   Talk a little bit about the conditions out there.   Pretty wet.   Pretty nasty. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, all obviously it is a little more difficult to keep playing in the rain.   You know, the greens got a bit softer as well, and pace‑wise on the greens it's not the same thing.   So you got to search for the things that the rain just changes the course a little. 
But I felt like I'm kind of used to playing in this kind of stuff.   I know you guys over here don't really like it that much.   I thought it was actually the perfect time just to press on and make sure I get a good score in.
