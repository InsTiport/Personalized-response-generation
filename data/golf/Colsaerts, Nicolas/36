Q.   You posted 12‑under par, very good finish, much more exciting than it was yesterday for you?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I felt like I just missed a couple of good opportunities today to stay right where I needed to be.   Today was good, even though early on I may be gave away a couple of shots, but the finish was quite strong.   It's just too bad to finish with five on the last with 6‑iron in my hand.

Q.   Fantastic tee shot on 17, first of all, what club was that? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It was seven.   I thought I hit a good putt.   Ricardo Santos who I was playing with, hit this thing that kind of moved right quite a bit, so I thought it was going to slide.   It just didn't.

Q.   So what were you, 380, 390 down the last, something like that?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I don't know.   I didn't even‑‑

Q.   It's so boring hitting it so far‑‑
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I was kind of busy.   I was trying to make three or four. 

Q.   6‑iron, what sort of shot was that?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   You can't miss it right, and I had plenty of room down the left, I thought just a little bit left to give myself a good look at it.   Just came out a bit hot and flew in the bunker.

Q.   Overall, pretty pleased? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, of course I am.   This is probably going to be me done for a little time.   I was quite looking for some time off.   I think this is well deserved now.

Q.   Will you play Dunhill? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, actually plans have changed.   I'm probably going to have to go home and play an exhibition match that I was due to play.

Q.   And maybe a little push and see if you can get into that Top 60? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, we'll see.   I have no idea what I'm going to do yet.   I think I'm just going to sit down, go to The Ryder Cup next week, do a bit of commentary and cheer on the boys first.
