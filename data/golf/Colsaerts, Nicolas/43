 Q.   A point for Europe; how did you play?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, it's totally off to Gonzalo.   He played fantastically well today.   I did a few contributions that seemed to be the difference just edging in the end.  
   
 Q.   I hear somebody was telling me your caddie that you as a team were 10‑under par through 15 holes.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   I think we did very well.   I think Nicolas was humble saying he didn't contribute that much.   I made some birdies, he made some others and Scott and Mark, they played well, as well.   Hopefully we made a few more.   
But overall, I think we are happy, very happy with the score, the way we played and looking forward to hopefully play again tomorrow.   It's up to the captain.  
   
 Q.   Have you played together before?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, we've played together a few times just in regular tournaments.   We've never played together as a team but we've known each other 15 years.   We know how to talk to each other, we get along great, so it seems to be a pretty good partnership.  
   
 Q.   You'd like to play with Nicolas again tomorrow?   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   (Laughing) I would love playing with Nicolas again tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   And Nicolas, obviously?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   So do I, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Obviously dovetailing well, that's the key, isn't it, the four‑balls, when one of you is out of the hole, the other one comes in, that seemed to be in the scoring.   
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   That's exactly what happened today.   I did play very well.   I made a lot of birdies, but I mean, the holes I wasn't really there, Nicolas hit some fantastic shots.   Probably the turning point of the round was the birdie he made on 12, because Mark hit a fantastic shot to within a foot of the hole, and Nicolas hung in there and holed a fantastic 6‑footer down the hill, so I think that's what's probably the turning point of the round.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Next thing we know, we are 4‑up two holes after, so it was definitely a key hole.   Gonzalo birdied the hole after, and I made a birdie after that.   So it was obviously a very key moment.  
   
 Q.   It's also a nice board, as well, because there's a lot of blue up there.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, it is up there.   I kept a very distant eye.   I was trying not too pay too much attention but I saw some of the matches were going our way, which is great to see on the opening day.  
   
 Q.   Hard not to keep looking at those boards, isn't it, because you want to see what's happening?  
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   You see so much blue and red and you want to know what's going on, you definitely want to know what's going on.   Even though you could see a lot of blue, I think most of the matches were really tight, and I think there are still two games out there and anything can happen.
