Q.   What was the story of your match today? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I thought it was a great game.   Obviously played pretty good.   Justin made one or two mistakes, and like the last two days, he seemed to be playing very well early.   I birdied, had a good start and put him in a situation he wasn't comfortable with and it was pretty good.

Q.   How do you do that, when you say that you are going to try to put him in that situation?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   You know, both of my matches‑‑ when I get to the first tee, I looked a little better than the first two games I played. 

Q.   How much are you living off what you achieved here last year?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   A little bit obviously.   We all knew that Justin was going to be quite a challenge, so I had to come up with a plan.   But even though the wind is completely different to the one we played last year, it's still a course where I can take advantage of some of the holes, just like the way I did eagle on 14.   There's a couple of holes where I can press down and try to make the most of it. 

Q.   Sounds as if you make a plan before each match; what's your plan from now on then? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I don't even know who I'm playing. 

Q.   And the weather conditions?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   We had the odd shower and I don't know how hard it's going to blow.
