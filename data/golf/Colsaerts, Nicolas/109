  Q. The fact that you beat one of the most experienced players in this event, sum up how that feels?  
 NICOLAS COLSAERTS: It feels very good. It's always tough to play somebody like Retief. He doesn't really give you much. He gave a few, I gave a few and we were pretty much even.   
  
  Q. You were 3-down early, what was the key to the fight back?  
 NICOLAS COLSAERTS: I started pretty bad, but I knew I had some good golf in me. He made a mistake or two and I made two birdies in a row in the early holes on the back nine to get me back to 1-down, but no, I just thought that it was going so badly it had to get better.   
  
  Q. How do you feel out here with the top five or six in the world?  
 NICOLAS COLSAERTS: It's a little weird, like all of a sudden you get dropped in this sort of event. But the main goal was obviously to go through Retief, so I didn't really feel that comfortable this morning, it was going to be a bit different.   
 So now, just try to get ready for the next match.  
  
  Q. You're guaranteed to be in the final 16, how do you approach a match against Rory McIlroy?  
 NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Well, we knew we had to get through Retief, so now, can probably enjoy a bit more of the rest of the afternoon and just really know what you want to do.
