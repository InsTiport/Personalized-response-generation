Q. Your third European Tour win took seven years to arrive. It's come an historic championship on an iconic golf course. Just how special is this moment?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: It's very special. I mean, The French Open for me is very special because I'm French-speaking. I've been coming here for I don't know how many years. It's been a long road. So many people have supported me over the years. That's why I get so emotional. I went through up and downs for so many years now. It's very, very special as you can see.
Q. Such a dramatic day, five ahead when you birdied the first two, behind after 12, you birdied 13, you chip-in for eagle at 14. How big was the adrenaline rush? How big did that moment feel?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Well, we knew the last four holes are always pretty dramatic. I proved it with hitting it in the water on 15. I mean, I don't know what happened on 17 with JB, but it was a bit of a surprise when I got on to the green. I thought I was still going to be one behind. But to look it in like this on 18, which is probably one of the most difficult par 4s on Tour, is very satisfying.
Q. You mentioned 15. You were one ahead teeing off at 15. You double-bogey, go one behind. How deep did you have to dig at that stage?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, pretty deep obviously but I did all day. My putter was pretty cold all day, which was a bit of the difference in the first three rounds. But like I said, I knew that if I still kept in contact with a birdie on 13 and cherry on top on 14, chipping it in, I knew I still had a chance because anything can happen on those last four.
Q. Incredible playing. Many, many congratulations, you're exempt till the end of 2021 having come into this week fighting for your card. Well done.
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Thank you.
