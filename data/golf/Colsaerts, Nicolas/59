 Q.   If they had said, okay, start round 2 right now, there was a thought they were going to send you guys right back out, would that have mattered?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I thought that was going to be the plan, actually.   I'm almost ready to go.  
   
 Q.   That wouldn't have bothered you?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   No, not really, not at all.   No, like I said, the course being wet, it makes everything a bit more accessible, like you're going to hit a lot of fairways because they're pretty wide and the ball is going to finish pretty much where it lands.   It's pretty much throwing darts if you're on.  
   
 Q.   What we've seen so far is that momentum gained yesterday has been somewhat hard to hold onto today, people coming back.   In retrospect how important was making that putt?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, that was my main goal this morning when I went out.   It's not the same when you start your round when you have a six‑foot putt to keep a lead up.   If you miss that, you feel like you maybe have just let one slide by.   
But yeah, I'm sure that hanging around that much now in the clubhouse and waiting to go out if you're a couple holes down, and if you don't really get off to the start‑‑ if you don't show up with your game face on, it's going to be tough to come back.  
   
 Q.   When you decided to play on the U.S. Tour, did you expect to have snow?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   No, it's funny, I just told radio I changed my schedule to go skiing in a couple weeks.   I never really thought to see snow in the desert.   But yeah, we know that West Coast is a bit funky, as we saw in San Diego.   So I know what it is now.   
   
 Q.   What was the change in the schedule?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I was going to play Bay Hill, and I wasn't going to play Honda and play Bay Hill, and I'm just going to switch those two so it gives me a two‑week break.   I haven't really been home since‑‑ I've only been a week in Belgium since mid‑October.  
   
 Q.   So you'll skip Doral‑‑  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   No, I'm playing Doral.  
   
 Q.   Honda, Doral, skip Tampa and Bay Hill?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Exactly, and then I'll have that two‑week break, and then I'll go ski back home for a couple days.  
   
 Q.   Where do you go ski?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   We'll go to France, France and Switzerland actually.   I can't wait to get some food in me, melted cheese and stuff.
