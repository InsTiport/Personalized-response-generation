Q. What are your thoughts about how well you played in buffeting winds?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, very happy.  But I still felt like I could have played a little bit better, especially on the last three.  Missed a good birdie chance on the par 3, 13, and then I drove the front edge on 14 and it bubbled out of the fringe and I 3-putted that.
So felt like maybe could have done just one or two shots better.  But in these conditions, I think anything under 2-, 3-under is a pretty good score.
Q. I appreciate there's still some ground to make up, but you're in a nice position, aren't you?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, I'm happy to have put myself back into a little bit of contention, even though Sullivan is quite up there.  But yeah, a good one tomorrow, try to get as close as possible and make as many birdies and try to finish this week as high as I can.
Q. Having played a shotgun start this morning, has it made any kind of difference to routines, approaches, knowing that we've got the same again tomorrow?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: No, not really, it just feels like being in a Pro-Am, to be fair; only you're playing with two other fellow professionals.
Yeah, it's just a bit odd when everybody tees off at the same time and see everybody get around in the same timing, but no, it didn't really bother me that much today and I hope it's not going to bother me tomorrow.
