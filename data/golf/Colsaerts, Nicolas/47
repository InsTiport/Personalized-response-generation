Q.   Talk about your play here.
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It s an exhausting course to play and very difficult.   It was blowing quite a lot when we went out, then firming up.   It s basically a case of limiting the damage on the long holes and even the short holes.   Pars feel like birdies.   That s why the scores are how they are.
I m quite satisfied with the week.   I was pretty much there all week and not far from doing something really, really good.   So I have to be satisfied with that.   It s just too bad that I had that finish yesterday as I could probably have got a little closer.   It s a pretty good week for me though.
To finish top 15 is great.   The more you are in this sort of environment the better.   It s obviously different to a normal Tour event.   You can feel the electricity in the air.   It s a big deal.   When you hold on and play decent golf in these circumstances, it s very encouraging for many more majors to come.
