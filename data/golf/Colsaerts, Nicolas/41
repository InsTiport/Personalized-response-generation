  NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   They played well towards the end, so no regrets.

Q.   All the more galling when you have been ahead for so long in the game?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, of course, I missed the chance on 10 to go 3‑up; 3‑up is a pretty good number to be at.   And then I missed another chance on 16 to day 2‑up with two to go and that would have been a bit more comfortable.   We lose the next and we've still got a chance on 18 and don't grab it. 
I thought it was a pretty good game the last couple holes. 

Q.   Another good morning's work.   How pleased are you getting that victory? 
JOOST LUITEN:   Very pleased.   The way we played the first nine, we didn't play great.   We were 2‑down and to win it then, it's pretty good.   I think it was a big difference between the front nine and back nine.   We were a lot more positive on the back nine, and we created more chances and hit some better shots.   Yeah, it's been a good day. 

Q.   Seemed very difficult on the greens and neither players were holing putts early on.   Why was that? 
GREGORY BOURDY:   I don't know, but yeah, today it was more difficult to hole the putts.   But we had a great fight and it was an amazing victory I think today.   We came back from actually something bad and we just had some good words from also Chema, our captain, and I think we have more confidence after that, and I think we played a great game on the back nine to win on 17. 

Q.   Chances are you'll be playing this afternoon together; what do you think? 
JOOST LUITEN:   I don't know.   It's up to the captain but three out of three so far, so it's a good team.
