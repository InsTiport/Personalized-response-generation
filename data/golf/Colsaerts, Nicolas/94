Q.   Nicolas, let me just go back to last week, a little bit strange tournament, shortened.   Were you disappointed on Sunday?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, a little.   I was probably putting a little too much pressure on myself.   I know there was quite a few things at stake, so yeah, a little disappointed, but I didn't end up in the worst fashion anyway.   I still fought back a little, so yeah, I'm still happy.

Q.   Well, you're obviously still playing as good as you have been playing last weeks, obviously, six under par opening round here in Dubai.   How was it?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Pretty good considering I was not really feeling the best after five or six holes early on.   I wasn't really playing that good.   And then everything sort of got into place together and started hitting it pretty close, and putting, actually converting some of the chances I got, made a nice eagle on 18, which was my ninth so got everything going, and another two birdies on finish on the last three, so yeah, pretty solid all the way through.

Q.   How do you see playing conditions on the course, obviously without winds, a little bit easier playing, and how good is the course?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, the greens are fantastic.   If you start off on the ninth and if you read them right, you're going to pretty much hole everything, and the greens are quite receptive as well.   Usually they get a little hard over here, maybe more over the weekend, but.
I think the course is in fantastic shape.   The fairways are just mint.   Rough is not as thick as it used to be, so I think it's a very fair golf course.

Q.   Thank you very much.
