Q.   Four and three loss yesterday, three and two win today, how did your play compare? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, I played a little better of course.   I kept the ball in play a bit more than yesterday.   That's what the plan was, but mission accomplished.   I just need to win a game and see what the remaining game does this afternoon. 

Q.   Previously when you played this championship, you were a semifinalist and then won it; how about this venue for your game?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It's of course different.   The thing with this course is regardless if you're a short or long hitter, you're in pretty much from the same spot.   So that brings a lot of guys‑‑ brings the guys back together, but it's a great test of match play.

Q.   How will you spend your afternoon, because it's possible you might be needed for a playoff later on; you all could end up with two points. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I don't know yet.   I'm obviously going to check from a distance what the game this afternoon does and go accordingly.
