 Q.  Yesterday you said you felt a little bit tired.  When you've had an eagle to finish, are you elated and the adrenaline, the buzz is there?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, of course, a grandstand finish on the last is always nice, but it's the same scenario again:  I go from shooting myself in the foot with a couple of 3-putts, missing short ones again, and then I play a game that's probably nine out of ten, all the parts of the game.   
So it can be very frustrating, when you get into this position in those big tournaments, it's kind of maybe a little easier to keep digging in and not really let it away from you.   
 Q.  Do you have to especially brace that, to know that there will be some downside, and yet there are so many positives, so many highs, that you're still very much involved?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, I mean, it's in my personality to go, you know, both extremes.  So like you said, maybe it's just a matter of accepting it and knowing that you might do a couple of mistakes, but when you do play good, it usually turns out quite well.   
 Q.  How conscious are you of leaderboard and the fact that the eagle has pushed you right up into second again?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: I was looking a little bit on the last couple of holes.  It didn't really strike me that much, but of course when you finish with three on the last -- a birdie on 16 and an eagle on the last, you make quite a decent jump and you realise, hang on, I'm just one shot off the lead.   
 Q.  What do you need to do on Sunday then?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: I think I just need to do the same thing.  Maybe avoid a little mistake here and there, but if I keep playing the way I've been playing the last three rounds, and it kind of falls into place, I think most people are aware of what I'm capable of.
