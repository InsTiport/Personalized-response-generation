Q.   A match you looked totally in control of but Gonzalo wouldn't lie down, what was going through your mind as 5‑up five to play became 1‑up and one to play. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, yeah, you start to realise you run out of holes.   I mean, it's totally my fault.   I should have ended this game about an hour, an hour and a half ago.   I have a putt to win the game on‑‑ what is it, 13; and there's a par 5, and you know, I made a bit of a mess of it.   Thank God it's over.

Q.   What did you learn from winning this championship last time, and indeed being semifinalist the year before that you can use this time around?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, the same as today; that it's never over.   Gonzalo, I mean, I pretty much made the same‑‑ I finished the same way Gonzalo started.   He handed me a couple of holes too easily early on, and I did the same on the last stretch.   If you go through a bad 20, 30 minutes, you know, you can make moves one way or another.

Q.   G‑Mac or Van Pelt this afternoon; Van Pelt is fighting back.   Do you mind who it is?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   No, not really.   I played with Bo two weeks ago in America and Graeme I've played before.   I just have to make sure I don't make a mess of it like I did this morning.
