Q.   How does it feel having played so well? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It's pretty painful.   When you are in a game that you have the chance to go all the way to 18 or get something out of it, it's a big difference.   It's very, very painful. 

Q.   Sergio's chip was magical at the 16th, do you think it would turn in your favor? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Of course, we get 1â€‘down with two to go but all of a sudden, you know, we have got a decent chance to go to 18 and making something happen.   It's just one of those moments where you need a few Ryder Cups under your belt.
