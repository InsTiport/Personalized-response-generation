Q.   Give us your thoughts, 3â€‘under, decent start?
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, holed two very long putts early into the round on 14, 15.   I got quickly under par, sort of got the round going.   And then gave myself a lot of chances between 18 all the way to the third, and then a few more, 7 and 9. 
Didn't hole any.   Could have been a lot better.   But I played very good, very solid and in control. 

Q.   How did you feel after last week?   Was there a hangover, or did you pick yourself up quite quickly after it?   Disappointing not to get in the playoff, but you did play well. 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   No, I tried to get in the same sort of frame of mind.   I wasn't really devastated after missing the putt on the last last week.   I played really good like you said.   I think there was a lot of positives out of it, first week of the year, playing in such a good tournament. 

Q.   And is this a course that you like; suits you? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, there are some of the holes that you can hit it quite a long way and give yourself short irons into some of the long par 4s.   Definitely reaching some of the par 5s, as well, so yeah, an advantage.
