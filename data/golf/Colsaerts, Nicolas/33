 Q.   Your thoughts on a lovely round like that?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Very happy.   Played well all day.   Managed to play the par 5s very well, which is not always my strength to be honest for somebody that hits it as long as me.   I think I can always do a little better on par 5s.   But managed very well today on them and played pretty decent the rest.   So it just adds up to a decent score.  
   
 Q.   I take it you favour the length of this course?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I do, yeah.   There's a few holes where they still could have kicked it a bit further back to my taste, but it was good.   They have done pretty well because the wind, it was just a slightly different direction wind today, and they kept the tees back, which was good for me.   
   
 Q.   Anything special about the eagle coming home?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I hit a really good 3â€‘wood straight down the line and it just squirt out of the rough to about 12 feet, maybe 15 feet and made it.   
So, yeah, a bit of a bonus, because I didn't really expecting to and send it that far on the green into the wind.   So big bonus there.  
   
 Q.   I take it you're one of the players that's nicely acclimatised, because you were out for Hong Kong and you've kicked around in this part of the world since.     
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I went to Thailand last week where Brian lives, my caddie, which is great.   Didn't really play that much.   Just chilled.   It's been a long couple last years, so I was due a week of nothing and really enjoyed it.
