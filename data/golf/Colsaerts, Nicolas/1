 Q.  Being the Amundi Open de France Champion, how special is this one?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: It's super special. I've been coming here for more than 15 years, French-speaking, I know what makes them tick. I've been coming here for so long and missed out a bunch of times, and to do it here, to do this like this, where at the end it was a pretty dramatic -- makes it even better.   
 Q.  You mentioned the drama there, just battling it out there with George and then JB came into the mix later. How exciting to play in those conditions?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Well, I made a big mistake on 15. I thought it was slowly slipping away. I knew there was always going to be a chance because the last holes, anything can happen. It was a surprise to come on 17 and find out what JB had done. But like I said, when you hole the last putt like this, and you come out on top, it's really a special feeling.   
 Q.  Seemed like across the leaderboard there, were doubles and triples. Important to maintain the mental aspect of your game and keep grinding?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, especially here. I mean, the last four, anything can happen. There's water everywhere. 17 is a strong par 4. You have to hit a couple of good shots to make par. We've seen it before and we'll probably see it again.   
 Q.  It's been an excellent day to watch this, must give you great confidence moving into the weeks ahead?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS: Yeah, I was kind of looking for a week like this where everything sort of clicked together. I don't really have a week like that for a long, long time. You know, it changes everything for me for the next couple of years. Lighter schedule. I have a wife at home and a little kid now that I am going to be able to spend a bit more time with now, which is nice.
