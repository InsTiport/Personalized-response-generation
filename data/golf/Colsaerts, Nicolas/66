 Q.   It was nip and tuck all the way?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, it was very close.   Him and I pretty much played the same.   He gave me two holes and then I gave him two.   Then when you go down, like with six, seven holes to go, you can't be giving away two holes to your opponent.   And then he made a birdie on 16 and I just couldn't follow.   You know, it's just a bit of a sad end but it's been still a pretty good week for me.   
   
 Q.   It's been a great week, and it's been one of different emotions but started off brilliantly and of course today some disappointment but how much have you learned about Ryder Cup play?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I don't know, I'm going to have to sit down and think about it.   This is an unbelievable experience.   It gets you through the guts, you can see, and it's very, very special.   
   
 Q.   At this moment, how do you feel about European chances?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Yeah, I just looked at the board.   We are still looking pretty good.   I don't know what Rose is doing up 18 but this would be just a fantastic point to get and there's still a few games where we are allâ€‘square and everything, Sergio; this is going to be tight.   But this would be just an amazing comeback.
