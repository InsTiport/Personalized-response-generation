NICHOLAS LOAR:  Well, it was kind of an up-and-down all day.  I started out and got 1-up early and he fought back. And then it seemed like every hole we were all square or 1-up, all the way.  It was a good match.  It was one of those that you just have to get used to match play.  You never really are out of the hole, and you never have the hole won.


Q.  Did you go to 18 even?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  18 even.


Q.  You went to 18 all even?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  All square.


Q.  Tell us how you played the 18?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  He won 17 with par, and then he hooked his drive in the water on 18.  And I hit it out to the right in the rough; laid up short.  His next drive went in the rough.  He laid up short. I hit it short of the bunker; he hit it on the green.  I hit it  over the green; chipped up.  He missed his putt, and I made it.


Q.  How were you at the turn on 9?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  He was 1-up at the turn.


Q.  What was the putt you made?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  About four and a half feet.

NICHOLAS LOAR:  No.  I guess it's bad that a match has to end like that with those scores, but we both had a chance to make the putt on the last hole, and his just slid by him and mine went in.


Q.  That was for a 5?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  I made it for a 6.


Q.  You come to 18 all square?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  All square.


Q.  Let's do that again.  He hooked his drive in the water and the second one in the rough?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  Second one in the left rough, near the water.


Q.  Then what?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  So he's lying 3 there.  And then he lays out about, 150, 60 yards.  My tee shot went in the right rough.  I laid out about 180 yards.  My third shot was short of the bunker on the right; his 5th shot was about 8 feet.  My 4th shot went just over the green in the rough.  My 5th shot  chipped about four and a half feet.  And he missed his putt and I made mine.

NICHOLAS LOAR:  No, I've never had a match that ended quite like that.  I mean, Jonathan is a great player, and he's proven that all summer, and the last two years.  So I'm very fortunate to get out of that match with a win.


Q.  Is this kind of a shock to you to beat a player of that caliber?

NICHOLAS LOAR:  I don't know if I consider it a shock.  I get to play with my brother all the time, and he's a Walker Cupper, too.  I wouldn't consider it a shock.  I was playing pretty good coming in.

NICHOLAS LOAR:  He gave me some pretty good reads on some putts, and kept me loose.  I get up tight every now and then.  Him being there, he keeps me loose most of the time.
