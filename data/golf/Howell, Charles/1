  Q. Talk a little bit about the state of your game coming into the week.
 CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well this is one of my favorite events.  Partly because, yeah, I live here, but it's a little, it hits a little more at home, both of our kids were born right here in Orlando and at the Winnie Palmer Hospital and obviously Arnold Palmer Children's is right next door.
 So when your children are born in a hospital directly influenced by Mr. Palmer, and the host of the tournament, it's special, it just shows you what a massive impact he had on Orlando.
 Actually, I'm one of the lucky few, I've played a competitive round of golf with Mr. Palmer, we played the Shark Shoot-out together in 2000.  And then now my kids are born at hospitals that he funded.  So it's pretty special.
 Q. What was it like playing with him in 2000?  Were you a little bit nervous walking to that tee?
 CHARLES HOWELL III:   Oh, my gosh, yes.  Yes.  And was nervous by the end of it, too.  But it was incredible, I mean just, what a legend.  His partner that day was Peter Jacobsen and so I think you had two of the best characters in golf together.
 But what a special man.  I mean, living in Orlando, seeing how he's influenced the town and the community and what he's done, it's awesome.
