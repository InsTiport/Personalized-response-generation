 Q. Overall talk about your experience these last two days, playing a major championship. 
 ROB McCLELLAN: Just the experience, it was fun. Last year was a little bit of nerves and I was just excited about being there. This year, a little less nerves.
 I hit the ball well. Yesterday I really struggled. I couldn't get off the tee and the whole experience the whole week has been great. It's been a highlight for us, the club pros, just getting to play with these guys.

 Q. How does this compare to some other courses you've played in the past?
 ROB McCLELLAN: It's one of the toughest obviously, and the scores show it. Yeah, it's a true test, and I was talking to the guys I was playing with coming up 16, and I asked them, have you guys ever played a course with as tough of finishing holes as the last five, and they haven't. 

 Q. What will you take from these last two days back to Pennsylvania with you?
 ROB McCLELLAN: Well, just, you know, just the fun, and the whole enjoyment of playing in it, and you know, going into next year, CPC, you want to finish in the Top-20 because you know how much fun it is to come out and play; and it is, it's so much fun to play.
