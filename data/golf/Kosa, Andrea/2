 Q.  If I'm reading correctly, this is your second USGA Championship?  
ANDREA KOSA: Correct.   
 Q.  And the last one was in 2011?  
ANDREA KOSA: Yes.   
 Q.  So what kind of reinvigorated your competitive golf?  
ANDREA KOSA: Well, I had kids, and they are old enough, and I feel fit enough again to compete. So I've been, you know, working at it again.   
 Q.  Amazing, and you're a physiotherapist?  
ANDREA KOSA: Correct.   
 Q.  Do you think that gives you an advantage over other players?  
ANDREA KOSA: I just know how to tape my hand really well.   
No, I don't think it gives me any advantage by any means.   
 Q.  Well, you had great round today. Were there any key shots?  
ANDREA KOSA: I don't really have any key shots. I hit off a lot of trees, actually. Had a really good spotter and I was able to scramble. I kind of got lucky and made shots when I needed to.   
 Q.  That's fantastic, especially given the wind?  
ANDREA KOSA: It was tricky for sure. Very windy.   
 Q.  It's been windier than other days. Did that factor into your strategy, switching things up?  
ANDREA KOSA: Club decision, yes, but strategy, not really. I just played the course and hoped for the best and we're both playing in the same thing. So that was my kind of -- just focus on what you need to do, and away you go.   
 Q.  Are you familiar with match play?  
ANDREA KOSA: Yes. Yes.   
 Q.  Do you prefer it to stroke play?  
ANDREA KOSA: Either's good. But I think match play is really fun. You know, you can blow up and just keep moving, and I'm okay with that.   
 Q.  Are your girls here with you this week?  
ANDREA KOSA: No. They are back at home, but they are sending me videos every night, and they are going, "Mom's a super star." They are doing school, and Dad is caddying by being dad and I'm out here on my own, winging it, and picking up some fans along the way.
