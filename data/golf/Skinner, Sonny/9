 Q.   Yesterday pretty even round, today pretty steady.   Any thoughts on that?  
SONNY SKINNER:   A lot easier conditions today than yesterday, obviously, from 25 mile an hour winds to maybe 10.   Totally different direction.   
But the greens were a lot more receptive.   Yesterday afternoon they were brutally hard and firm, had lots of trash on them from the wind blowing all over.   It was just really tough yesterday.   
So today, obviously it felt like a better day.   I hit the ball nicer, greens were more receptive, I had more birdie putts, they just didn't go in.   
 But still, to get away with an under par round, I'm not complaining and I'm tickled to death and I think I'm going to have a chance to play some more golf.  
 Q. Anything you're going to change going into the weekend?  
SONNY SKINNER:   No, I'm not.   I feel like I prepared real well.   I went around here four times.   I got up here on Saturday.   I know the golf course, it's just hitting the ball where I'm looking.   
I know a few things I need to tweak with my swing, but it's just very simple setup things, you know, don't stand too far from the ball, get your alignment going where your eyes are going and that's about it.
