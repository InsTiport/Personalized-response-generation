Q.   You played 1‑under today. 
SONNY SKINNER:   I played 1‑under, I really hit a lot of good shots.   I felt like I could shoot something low, but I just couldn't quite get it. 
I got 2‑under early and I got a little excited and next thing you know I'm swinging a little quick, hit a few bad shots and had a few bad putts. 
But I managed to hang in there and I'm proud of that and made a birdie coming in. 

Q.   Great birdie on finishing.   What's your overall thoughts on the course condition?
SONNY SKINNER:   I really think it's excellent, I really do.   I was here two years ago, it was a little firmer two years ago, now it's more mature and softer and I really like it.
