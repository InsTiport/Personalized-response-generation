 Q.   Can you just talk about a little bit about your round today?  
SONNY SKINNER:   I'm just scrambling too much.   Not hitting the ball as good as I would like.   Didn't putt as well.   Had a lot of opportunities to still make putts, even though they were for par.   
But I shot 2‑over par.   I hit some of the really good shots I hit I made bogey with.   They would hit the green and bound over.   
But anyway, a little disappointed today, I felt like I would, could possibly get it going a little bit better.   But I just ran out of steam on the back nine.  
   
 Q.   What did you think about some of the pin positions today?  
SONNY SKINNER:   I thought they were extremely challenging.   This is about as tough pins as I've seen the PGA have.   This is only my third Senior PGA, but they are just tough when you play the PGA Championship.   But you know what, the course is beautiful.   I think the course setup is great.   You just have to hit good quality shots.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel heading into the weekend?  
SONNY SKINNER:   Well, I hadn't felt that great all week, but I'm still 2‑under par.   So you know, if you look at it, I shot 1‑under, 1‑under.   That's not the worst in the world.
