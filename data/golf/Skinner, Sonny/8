Q.   Can you talk about your round today and what it's like to shoot a 69 on a course that's been difficult all week?
SONNY SKINNER:   You know what, I felt like I could shoot in the 60s and I finally did.   I felt good.   I hit the ball well.   I missed a couple of short putts early, but I just kept hitting the ball good.   And then I made a few, 10, 15 footers for birdie there. 
But real pleased.   I thought that with the wind I thought it played fairly tough.   And there's nothing else to say other than that.   I had held it together pretty good.   You got to hit some good solid shots when it's a little breezy and your targets are small going into the greens and I felt like I did that.

Q.   With the improvement over the three days and going into tomorrow your mentality going into tomorrow's round?
SONNY SKINNER:   I'm very encouraged.   I'm really motivated.   I would like to have ‑‑ my best tournament of the season on the Champions Tour so far 31st is the best I've been able to do.   I just looked, it showed I was like 42nd, so a good solid round tomorrow, maybe I can pass some folks and have my best tournament of the year. 

Q.   What's it like having the people like in Georgia rooting for you this week?
SONNY SKINNER:   I hardly could go take a shower last night.   I got over 30 texts and about 15 phone calls.   And it was, it's neat, because the day before when I finished bogey, triple, bogey, I didn't hear from anybody. 

Q.   That's how it works sometimes. 
SONNY SKINNER:   That's right.
