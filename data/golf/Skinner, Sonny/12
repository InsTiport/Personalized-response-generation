  Q. How did the round go?  
 SONNY SKINNER: You know, the round got off to a good start. Obviously I holed it for an eagle on No. 2 and I was hitting the ball real solid.   
 And then we had the long delay, I was 2-under at the delay, came back out, kept hitting the ball solid, made some nice putts. Made the turn in 4-under.   
 And then I mishit a few shots and I had two 3-putts. But overall I hit a lot of good shots. Some of my bogeys I still hit good shots. And, but I still made a bogey.   
  
  Q. So you're pretty content with the game, with the round?  
 SONNY SKINNER: You know, I think coming in and being as messy as it was if somebody said you would be in around even par, I would have taken it.   
 But obviously after having gotten off to such a good start I'm disappointed with my finish on the back side. I felt like I hit a few shots that were good enough that I should have had some pars, but I didn't. I missed, I just made some miss clubs and misjudged some speed on some long putts because of that and then made the bogeys.
