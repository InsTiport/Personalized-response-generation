  Q. This is your first time in the PGA Championship to make the cut. How was your experience so far?  
 SONNY SKINNER: It's been a good experience. The PGA's done a wonderful thing by allowing the club professionals to participate in this Major. I know we always have, but for my first trip I'm really pleased. They have done a great job.   
 It's unfortunate that our golf course is as wet as it is, they're playing the ball down today, I didn't think that that was a good call, but other than that everything else has been above par.   
  
  Q. So your play today was affected by the wet conditions you think and not playing lift clean and place?  
 SONNY SKINNER: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just about every fairway your ball's going to pick up mud. And it wasn't just mine it was every guy in our group our balls were picking up mud.   
 We were the first group out, but, yeah, the conditions this afternoon won't be too much different than they were in the second round.
