PAUL ROVNAK:  Seon Hwa, thanks for coming in and speaking with us.  It was a 3 hole playoff.  You played extremely well last week at the SBS Open, and you got into a playoff here this week.  This is only your second tournament as an LPGA member.  Although it didn't end up the way you wanted it to, this is a good way to start the year for you.  Talk about that.
SEON HWA LEE:  I wanted it to be a good start, so I worked hard with my coach, Mike Bender, so I practiced a lot.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Can you talk about today?  You had the lead going in.  You played well today and then you got into the playoff.  Can you talk about the last hole, maybe what you were thinking before the playoff?
SEON HWA LEE:  I already had a playoff with Meena in Korea, but I lose, so today I lose again.  I'm a little disappointed but I'll keep trying.
PAUL ROVNAK:  You played in a playoff with Meena in Korea?
SEON HWA LEE:  Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  How did that end up?  Who won that one?
SEON HWA LEE:  Meena.
PAUL ROVNAK:  We'll go ahead and take questions.
Q.  Were there some holes there that you felt like if you could go back and do them over, they would have won the tournament for you in regulation?
PAUL ROVNAK:  She's asking if there were any holes that maybe you would play over again and play differently and maybe the outcome would have ended up in your favor?  Are there any specific holes you are thinking if only I could play that hole again?  Like maybe No. 4 or No. 12?

Is there anything you would do differently on those holes?  That's what she's asking.  Is there any shot today that you said, I wish I could hit that shot again or I'd like to hit that shot again?

The chip shot on 12?  Can you talk about the chip shot on No. 12?  What happened there?
SEON HWA LEE:  The grass is thicker so I wanted to see if I can hit the 52 degree wedge, but I hit it fat.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do you feel you played well today?
SEON HWA LEE:  Yes.  I think I played well.  Hopefully I will play well this year.
Q.  At what point did you know you weren't in first place by yourself anymore?
PAUL ROVNAK:  Did you ever see the leaderboard and see someone else was tied with you for first place?
SEON HWA LEE:  Yes, I saw No. 16.
PAUL ROVNAK:  What did you think then?
SEON HWA LEE:  Just concentrate on my game, just hit the fairway, hit the green, make a 2 putt.  That's it.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Were you nervous at all going into the playoff?
SEON HWA LEE:  Not really, because we played a lot before in Korea before.  Not really.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Were you nervous at all playing 16, 17 or 18, when you knew that
SEON HWA LEE:  Yes, I was nervous on No. 17.
PAUL ROVNAK:  17, you were nervous?
SEON HWA LEE:  Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Why were you nervous?  Just because you had a chance to win?
SEON HWA LEE:  Yes.
Q.  On 18, the last putt in regulation, how long was that?
SEON HWA LEE:  No. 18?
PAUL ROVNAK:  Your last putt on 18 before the playoff.
SEON HWA LEE:  10 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Do you remember what club you hit there for your second shot?
SEON HWA LEE:  5 iron.
Q.  Can you talk about that putt?  Did it do what you thought it was going to do?
SEON HWA LEE:  I needed to hit it harder.  I missed it on the right side.
PAUL ROVNAK:  You hit it too hard?
SEON HWA LEE:  Yes.
Q.  Who are your golf heroes?
PAUL ROVNAK:  What golfers do you admire?
SEON HWA LEE:  Annika, because she's the No. 1 player.
Q.  Any Korean players?
SEON HWA LEE:  Grace Park, yes.
Q.  What were you thinking when Meena made the last putt on the playoff that won it?  What was going through your head, before she hit the winning putt?
SEON HWA LEE:  I think she make putt because she's a really good putter.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Were you hoping it wasn't going to go in?
SEON HWA LEE:  No.
Q.  You two played in Korea before, right?
SEON HWA LEE:  Yes.
Q.  What do you feel about this playoff, because it's your second playoff in the U.S.?
SEON HWA LEE:  I had a little pressure because I want to win, but I keep trying to win.  I'll have another chance, I think.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you.
