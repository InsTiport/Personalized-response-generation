PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you for coming in and joining us.  65 yesterday, 66 today, 13 under par after two days, that's a terrific score, you have a two shot lead.  You're a rookie on TOUR this year, just talk about playing so well and having a shot to win your first tournament tomorrow?  What worked well for you today?
SEON HWA LEE:  I started bogey on the first hole but I kept concentrate, just play golf and so I make a good score.
PAUL ROVNAK:  What do you think about tomorrow?  You'll have a chance to win.
SEON HWA LEE:  Probably if I'm putting well, I may have a chance.
Q.  You looked very calm and poised throughout the whole round and showing not much emotion.  How did you feel, were you nervous or how did you feel out there?
SEON HWA LEE:  Yeah, just concentrate and I just practice concentration.
Q.  Poker face?
SEON HWA LEE:  (Laughter).
Q.  There's a lot of other young players on TOUR, Michelle Wie, she has a big crowd, and Morgan Pressel, a lot of rookies, but they don't really publicize you.  Do you mind that you don't get the attention that Ai Miyazato or Morgan Pressel get?
SEON HWA LEE:  I just play golf and enjoy my game.  So I don't care about who is playing.
Q.  When Joo Mi Kim won last week, does that give you some inspiration knowing that that's a possibility that you can win this early in your career?
SEON HWA LEE:  I'm always confident, I'm ready, I'm always ready.
Q.  Every time you win the first time, you have to have a record of winning as the youngest winner and so you won over in Korea and you did win before, is there any different feeling than winning in Korea than in the USA?
SEON HWA LEE:  I have a confidence to win this tournament, and I won my first tournament in Korea.  I set the record in Korea and everything but I'm still confident and ready for tomorrow.
Q.  You're going to be playing with Lorena Ochoa, top players, been on Tour for a while, do you have enough experience with playing with those veteran players?  What do you think about playing with them?
SEON HWA LEE:  Hopefully I'll learn a lot from those two players I'll be playing with.  I'll learn a lot but it's my game, I'll focus on my play and we'll see what happens.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Let's go over your score card.
SEON HWA LEE:  No. 1, I hit driver very good and the second shot wasn't too good.  But I had 50 yards and I didn't make the green.
