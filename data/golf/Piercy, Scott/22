Q. Hectic 48 hours.  You're thinking you're going to play on Thursday.  You wind up playing on Friday and turn in a minus 2.  Not bad.
SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah.  Any time you shoot under par at the U.S. Open is good.  I struck it well.  I putted it well.  I managed it well.  So that turned out to be a good score.
Q. When the conditions changed, did it change your strategy, or did you just attack the course and take what it would give you?
SCOTT PIERCY: No, I mean, the conditions definitely dictated everything.  The different wind from yesterday to the softness of the fairways, the softness of the greens, it all -- all the conditions dictated everything.  I was going to hit a lot of 4 irons off of tees and let it roll out, and I ended up hitting drivers on some of those holes.
It's not that you had to be more aggressive, but you couldn't get it that far down the fairway anymore because it wasn't rolling 50 yards, it was backing up one foot.  It was all conditions.
Q. How do you maintain the position, quick turnaround, little time to think, just have to go out and play?
SCOTT PIERCY: Just keep trying to -- I've been really working on getting into my setup correctly, and then from there, putting a good swing on it and kind of staying in my little zone there working on that, trusting that.  Just keep trying to move forward and make good shots.  Try to think well so the good shots put me in good spots instead of a good shot putting me in a bad spot.
Yeah, it's a lot of work.  It's 36 holes on this golf course, you don't really wish that on anybody.  It's a challenge for us today, and I look forward to it and keep moving forward.
