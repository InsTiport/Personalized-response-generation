 Q. Scott, very nicely done. You just kept yourself in it. You just keep moving forward, and everybody else is too, though.
 SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah. You know, being kind of my home course, or pretty much my home course, it's -- you know, I shot 6 today and I feel like I left a million out there. I mean I'm happy, but I definitely left some out there.

 Q. Yeah. You made, what, six birdies on the back side, but you bogeyed the par-5. That's probably the one you're still kicking yourself about.
 SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah. I got a little unlucky there. I was chipping it out and the ball jumped straight in the air and hit a limb and went straight down. 
 Then I missed like a five or six-footer on 9 for eagle. You know, the putter got hot starting on 10 a little bit. And you know, you need that a little bit.

 Q. 15 greens yesterday, 16 today. Everything else is working.
 SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah. You know, I'm missing it better. You know, I'm not hitting it perfect. I'm not hitting the exact shot I want, but I'm not -- you know, hitting it off the map either, so like I said, I play here so often.

 Q. You know where the good shots are. You know what could be done here.
 SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah. You know, I've shot 60 around this golf course a few times, 61. Even when I've played decent I've shot 65 out here. So I'm happy with today, it's just that par-5 coming in definitely leaves a bad taste in your mouth. 

 Q. Do you think there's a 61 out there? There was today. Do you think there are more out there?
 SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah. It's like playing in a bubble right now. It's a breath of wind and the greens aren't fast enough to really make anybody look silly. And you know, they're still receptive enough to be able to fire at a few flags that you might not be able to normally.
