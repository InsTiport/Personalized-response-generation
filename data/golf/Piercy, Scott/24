 Q. Talk about your round.   
SCOTT PIERCY: I got off to a great start. Made some great putts early, got a couple under par and made kind of a bad bogey on 7.   
But for the most part I just kind of hung in there, made pars when I needed to, tried to make a birdie when I could, and tried to eliminate the bogeys.  
   
 Q. Going into the weekend you're four back right now?  
SCOTT PIERCY: If I can continue doing what I'm doing and clean up a couple of mistakes that I made, continue making birdies, and you never know what happens.  
   
 Q. Were conditions kind of similar to when you played yesterday?  
SCOTT PIERCY: I felt like it was. I think it blew harder in the afternoon yesterday and it was fairly similar today. The only differences was the greens started to get a little more dried out, kind of had that brownish tinge to them, once you got on top of them. But I felt a little bit different wind direction, more out of the north today. So fairly similar.  
   
 Q. (Inaudible, question on success in the last year.)  
SCOTT PIERCY: You know, I just keep trying to get better. I've been kind of trending in the right direction and feel comfortable with myself on the golf course and what I'm doing and need to continue to keep doing it.
