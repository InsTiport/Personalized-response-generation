Q.   What do you expect the next three days?   Did this seem like the best day to kind of get at it? 
SCOTT PIERCY:   You never know.   I mean, the scores under par could piss the PGA off and they may not water the rest of the week, not cut anything, cut the greens really fast.   You never know what they are going to do.
If they keep it relatively similar to this, I think it's fair.   It rewards good golf shots. 

Q.   This was drastically better than your last major round, wasn't it? 
SCOTT PIERCY:   Yeah.
