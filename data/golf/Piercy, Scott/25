Q. Here with the two guys who probably had more fun in this match play event than anybody else, Rickie Fowler, Scott Piercy.  Little bit of a roller cost day out there for both of you guys.  You guys were cutting up?
RICKIE FOWLER: Goofing off and having fun.  Some good golf at times, couple of shaky holes.  Other than that we had a good time.  We're good buddies, so fun to see the groups come out.  Knew it was going to take good golf to win the match.
Q. Of course you guys ended up halving the match.  You had a chance to win on the 18th.  Took a peek a Rickie's, but it didn't do the same thing as yours did?
SCOTT PIERCY: Hit it a little hard.  His didn't break and mine broke.  Gave it an inch less and missed it by that much.
Q. What it's like to have to play against one of your buddies out there?  You were cheering for him, he was cheering for you, but then you were trying to trip him with your putter?
SCOTT PIERCY: He tackled me on 13 tee.  Kicked the bag out from under me.  Then he rolls in about three 20-footers.  I was about ready to steal his putter.
RICKIE FOWLER: That's what you're supposed to, right?
SCOTT PIERCY: Luckily for me, I made that putt on 16, kind of opened the door on 17.
