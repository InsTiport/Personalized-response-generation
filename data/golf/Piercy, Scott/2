SCOTT PIERCY: They should call me David Copperfield today.  That was magic.  So the places I hit it and just -- it was terrible.  It was terrible, and the putter was just amazing.  Just the long game, not quite there right now.  But able to kind of put it in spots to give myself some decent looks at pars.   
So really happy with where the putter is.  Need to go work on the full swing.  And I felt like it got a little bit tougher, but I didn't have my best stuff here.   
 Q.  The magic's good enough to get you somewhere near the top, so it's not the worst thing, despite the way things went?  
SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah, you know, I'm really happy with where I finished.  You know, I made like a 25-footer on the last hole for par.  So it's -- there's a lot of 10-to-12-footers for par today, and patience and grinding, and the putter just being magical today.   
 Q.  You grind like that, you struggle a little bit, but you're still where you are.  What does that say about your chances for tomorrow and how you approach it?  
SCOTT PIERCY: You know, I need to clean up the ball-striking a little bit.  But, you know, sometimes when you win, it's not about your really good rounds, it's about how you save the bad ones.  And today was a total save.   
So, you know, shooting 1-over today was, you know -- I'm actually really excited about it.  I'm just trying to wrack my brain on how to fix the full swing.   
 Q.  And in what way does that affect your approach to tomorrow?  
SCOTT PIERCY: You know, I'm going to go get on the range and try to iron some things out.  And hopefully the long game shows up and the putter stays.
