 Q. What happened today?
 SCOTT PIERCY: I was a little off, putts didn't go in, and a couple good shots that got me ahead of the game yesterday weren't there today. A couple bad breaks early in the round, plugging balls in bunkers that probably shouldn't have plugged. Just missed some putts.

 Q. What's the lesson for tomorrow? You've got two rounds on the South coming up back-to-back, and you probably learned a lot today. 
 SCOTT PIERCY: You know, following up a 64 is usually pretty tough anyway. I'm not going to try to do anything different, just come out and play and hopefully it will be different tomorrow. A couple putts here and there, that goes a long way on the South.
