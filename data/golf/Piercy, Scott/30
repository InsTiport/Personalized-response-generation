 Q.  Thoughts on your round for the day.  
SCOTT PIERCY: I got off to a good start.  I made some good putts early.   
I think the heat got to me a little bit today and I made some mistakes.   
I 3-putted the par-5, No. 5.   
I hit some bad chips on No. 3, the par-5.  Didn't make birdie.   
Missed a short putt on 18.   
I just kind of got out of sync on -- started really on No. 1, when I made the turn and just kind of struggled.  I think it's the heat, just kind of got to me.  I'm still right there, but obviously I would like to be two or three better.   
 Q.  How do you bounce back from this heading into the weekend?  
SCOTT PIERCY: Well, it's hard to follow-up 10-under anyways.  So, I felt like I did pretty good.  The heat kind of got to me afterwards.  So, I felt like I did all right, but just warm-up in the morning, get it back together, and keep going.   
 Q.  Are you going to practice or sit back and recharge your batteries?  
SCOTT PIERCY: Just recharge the batteries.  It wasn't terrible, terrible, it was just a little out of sync and when you're firing on everything and then out of sync a little bit, seems like it's really bad, but it's really not that bad.  Probably a couple little mental errors and the body was tired, so.
