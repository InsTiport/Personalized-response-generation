Q. You played pretty good yourself on a day like today at 4-under but what was it like witnessing that?  How would you rate that round?
SCOTT PIERCY: You know, it was really good.  The wind was kind of down, at least for a few holes, and it kind of started early and I started off solid, knocked it on the first green in two, 2-putted, stuffed it on -- he stuffed it all day, he really did.  He stuffed it on 11 to six feet.  Made it.  That's the other thing, he's been making like 6-footers, eight-footers, just rolling them in.  Just making that ball disappear.  He made some 30-footers, some 20-footers, I mean every time he stuffed it, he pretty much made it.
Q. Did you see any difference in his demeanor the last couple holes?
SCOTT PIERCY: Oh, those last three holes are brutal.  I mean when -- everybody knew that -- we're chipping hybrids and hitting 4-irons from 180, so the fact that he made a bogey or two coming down the stretch is, I mean he played awesome.  Hat's off to him, it was a pleasure to watch.
