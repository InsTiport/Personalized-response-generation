 Q.  Scott Piercy, really got it going from the 8th.  You played a really strong closing 11 holes at a closing 31 on the second 9.  5-under, 65.  Really happy with that day?  
SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah, especially how it started.  The first 7, 8 holes I really scraped it around and started getting healthy in there and kind of found a little something, maybe off the 8th tee, 8th green and then just kind of road it, hit two great ones on 12 and 13, made birdies, which is, you know, stealing from the field right there and, you know, I was really proud of it.  Today was about getting it in the hole for me.  I didn't have my best stuff but managed to turn the score out of it and really looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  The ones where you don't have your best stuff but still put a 65 on the board.  
SCOTT PIERCY: When I missed it, I chipped it close and that's what your short game is there, kind of bail you out a little bit.  When do you hit some good shots -- because even when we do our best efforts we're still going to hit good shots.  So I can kind of dog paddle well and hit a little bit of a stride.  That's kind of what today was about.   
 Q.  Had a lot of Top 25s but not a lot of Top-10s.  Have a great weekend.  
SCOTT PIERCY: Thanks.  Appreciate it.
