  Q. Scott, understand you had an up and down day today. Can you give us a few insights as to how you made it turn out so well?   
 SCOTT PIERCY: I started after the day good before it got kinda windy, made a couple of birdies, and then hit a lot of really good shots that ended up just terrible, so I made three bogeys to finish the front nine, and I had good shots on every single one of 'em.   
 I just guessed wrong with some of the lies out of the rough, into the wind, I really -- it sounds weird but I almost hit it "too good" today. Sounds weird but the wind just never touched my ball today. I hit it solid, and the I was fortunate I made a couple of good putts and was able to get up and down. Then I eagled No. 7, my 16th hole, which was nice, and I stuffed it on the last hole to make a tough day seem even better, you know?   
  
  Q. Congratulations. I know everybody was worrying about the wind coming in and it kept the scores up but you seemed to take advantage. Tell us about the second to the last shot on No. 9.   
 SCOTT PIERCY: I had been hitting the ball so far all day, for whatever reason, I don't know, and I had 108 yards to the pin. I hit a flat lob wedge, and it was out of the first cut of rough.   
I didn't think the wind was hurting and I knew the front edge was 100, and I knew I could get a lob wedge to the front, just tried to hit it flat so if it was short, it would skip up, and it came out perfect. One hop, stopped right by the flag.   
  
  Q. I was sitin' there watching, it was great, congratulations.   
 SCOTT PIERCY: Thank you.
