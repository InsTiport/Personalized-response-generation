 Q. Scott, kind of talk a little bit about your round today. 
 SCOTT PIERCY: If I was a roller coaster ride at Magic Mountain, I would be the best ride there. I don't even know if I make pars anymore, it's just birdies and bogeys. I'd get going, make three birdies in a row, make two bogeys. A lot of it is really fun and a lot of it is really frustrating.

 Q. Is there anything positive you take out of today?
 SCOTT PIERCY: Oh, there's tons of positive stuff going on, just some bad stuff. The bad stuff is really kind of silly stuff, which may be frustrating.
 Overall there's a lot of good going on. I'm putting well and making lots of birdies, which is really important out here. I'm looking forward to the weekend.

 Q. You played well here last year. Is there something about this course that you enjoy?
 SCOTT PIERCY: I just feel comfortable on it. I don't know, it's just one of those golf courses, magic kind of comes around a little bit.

 Q. What's been your take the first couple years on No. 16? Do you have any good stories for there? 
 SCOTT PIERCY: My bad story is -- well, I made birdie this year, but I think the best one is I hit it to ten feet a couple years ago, and they booed me. I thought it was a great shot, but not good enough, I guess. 

 Q. What were the hiccups today? 
 SCOTT PIERCY: You know, I bet probably ten times this week I hit it right down the middle, inside 150 yards, middle of the fairway, thinking birdie chance, and I'd miss the green and make a bogey. Stuff that you just really shouldn't be doing. Then I'll come back and make three birdies. Then I'll miss the green from the middle of the fairway.
