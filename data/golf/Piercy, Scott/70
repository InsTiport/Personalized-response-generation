  Q. Another good day. That's three in a row. Really solid out there. You got to be happy.  
 SCOTT PIERCY: I am. I played good yesterday and carried over today. Couple times I hit a little bit of a loose shot. I make a putt off the fringe and I chipped one in. You need a little good fortune to be near the top and hopefully I made a couple putts and had a really good day.  
  
  Q. At one point you had four straight birdies and a good looking five straight.  
 SCOTT PIERCY: I thought I made it, actually, when I hit it and actually the next hole I hit it close from there, too, and it was going good. I had a couple good breaks the first couple birdies and it was -- you know, it was exciting.  
  
  Q. You're in position now, Scott, to really accomplish some good things tomorrow with another good day. Now it's all about you just have to go do it again.  
 SCOTT PIERCY: Yeah. These guys are good, you know. When I'm on my game I think I can compete and I've been in this situation a couple times with the lead and I haven't played how I wanted to. Hopefully things will change a little bit.  
 And couple goals, I want to get in the FedExCup, definitely, kind of my mini goal for the week, if I could do that, and I pretty much lock-up my card for the year, another goal. Obviously, I'd love to win. So, you know, tomorrow is a lot of golf left and I'm excited to play.  
  
  Q. Great week. Keep it going.  
 SCOTT PIERCY: Thanks.
