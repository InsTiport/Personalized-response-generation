A flash interview with:
SCOTT PIERCY
Q. The round of the day, 6-under par.  Wasn't easy out there, was it?
SCOTT PIERCY: No, you have to play the holes coming back in to the clubhouse.  I played the holes going out really well, and I was lucky.  I hit some really good iron shots today.
I switched irons to the new ATPs about a week and a half ago, and into the wind today, they performed really well.
Q. Going out you certainly played well on the back side there.  Birdie, birdie, eagle through that stretch.
SCOTT PIERCY: Well, you know, that's sort of the stretch to get it today.  You have to get 10, 11, 12, 13, because when you turn back into 14, it's all into the wind.
You have the par-5, and you have to lay up, pretty much.  16.  17 is a tough pin.  I got the holes that I needed to get going out, and hopefully for me, big bird on 13 and that really kind of boosts you.
Q. Looking at 17, you had a difficult chip shot over the bunker to that peninsula part of the green.  The putt, seemed like you weren't sure of the line on that one.
SCOTT PIERCY: You know, the green book says it goes right.  Looked really straight for me and it actually went left.
It's just one of those things where they have redone it a bit, you know, it's the nuances that you're used to doing a certain thing and it's doing the opposite.
Q. 6-under par on the day, 5-under overall.  You did a lot right today.
SCOTT PIERCY: It was a lot of good.  I struck it well for two days, and yesterday the putter was not -- you know, not even there.  Today it kind of showed up a little bit, so I'm going to go work on some putting and hopefully the ball striking carries over and I make some putts.
