  Q. Scott, you were waiting for awhile and now you know, you're Mr. 125. How does it feel?  
 SCOTT PIERCY: Oh, man. I wanted to make that putt on last hole to -- that was big for me and just broke right, right at the hole and caught the low lip and, you know, I accomplished my goal for the week and I got to go play well next week, too.  
  
  Q. You turned it around because you had a tough time on the front side with the three straight bogies and on the tough back-9 you played really well.  
 SCOTT PIERCY: You know, big heart today. Lot of guts and big heart and just lucky to be there, you know. It's been a long year and hopefully this kind of will turn it around.  
  
  Q. Now you have to make travel plans. One more week. That's exciting.  
 SCOTT PIERCY: I hope I can sleep in tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Michael is supposed to work for us next week. He's going to be carrying your bag.  
 SCOTT PIERCY: He's going to be carrying it. I'm really excited.  
  
  Q. Way to go.  
 SCOTT PIERCY: Thanks.
