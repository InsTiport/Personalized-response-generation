 Q.  Bogey-free round for you.  What was working well?  
AMELIA LEWIS: Yeah, I hit a lot of greens.  I was just really consistent.  I wish a few more putts would have gone in, but you can't complain about bogey-free.   
 Q.  Anything you're working on today heading into the weekend?  
AMELIA LEWIS: Yeah, I'm trying to tighten up my putting a little bit because this is a putting match out here.  Whoever can make the putts is going to win this thing.   
 Q.  How were the conditions today compared to yesterday?  
AMELIA LEWIS: I mean, they were perfect.  This weather is amazing.  The wind, there's not much wind, and the course is great.  It's perfect.
