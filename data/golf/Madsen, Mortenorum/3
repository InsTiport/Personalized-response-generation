 Q.   The start of the day, it was hard to identify players who were going to challenge Rory McIlroy and you came from a long way back.   Did you have that in mind?   Did you have any special confidence?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Obviously I felt pretty confident from the round I played yesterday.   That was one of my best rounds ever almost.   I obviously didn't expect to, it's hard to go out and shoot a low number again coming from yesterday.   
I felt solid and more relaxed today actually than I did yesterday.   I was nice and calm all the way and putted well and hit the ball solid, as well.   I wasn't really in any major trouble, so that was nice.   
   
 Q.   We felt a bit guilty about not highlighting your great round yesterday because Rory takes all the headlines but you must be used to that.   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yeah, obviously he's on such a fantastic run, he deserves it.   
   
 Q.   Do you have some friends here this week?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   I have my Danish manager and his family flew in and my coach is here and a friend, as well.   We've been having a great time this week, going out to dinners and enjoying Dubai off the golf course, as well.   So it's been great so far.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you're going to go into tomorrow as a tremendous underdog but given what happened in Abu Dhabi two weeks ago, and Gary Stal, does that give you inspiration?   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Obviously he's going to be tough to beat.   He looks like he's playing pretty solidly out there, as well.   I'm just going to go out tomorrow and see if I can play some of the same golf that I played today.   I won't be too disappointed if I don't win tomorrow.   I'll be happy‑‑ if I do what I set out to do and play pretty solidly, I'll be happy, as well, tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   We say it's tough to follow a low round like yesterday, but I take it that's pretty satisfying today.   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   It was.   As you said it's always tough to come back the next day and follow‑up a round of 63, and with the conditions being a little bit tougher, I think the breeze was up a little bit more today than it has been the first couple of days.   
So a low number wasn't exactly in the cards but I played really well and I'm really happy with how I handled myself.   
   
 Q.   Plenty of chances and a lot of red figures.   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   I would say that I hit the ball more solid today than yesterday.   I hit more greens and fairways and was giving myself more chances and not having to fight for pars very many times.   That was nice and stress free.   
   
 Q.   You must know that you're climbing the leaderboard but were you conscious of moving right up to second spot and then who was actually leading?   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yes, we saw pretty early on the front nine that Rory was playing well again.   Didn't worry too much about it.   Obviously I saw the boards and saw my name on it but I luckily had a good day just trying to ignore and just try to hit good shots and for the most part, I did.   
   
 Q.   The same for Sunday, try to ignore what else is going on and do your best?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Sort of clichÃ© to say that.   That's what everyone says.   That's how you have to approach it and as I said, I'm just going to try and go out tomorrow and do the things I set out to do and if I played pretty solid golf, I'll be a happy golfer tomorrow night.   
   
 Q.   Do you do that with the knowledge of what's happened with Charl Schwartzel and Martin Kaymer and know you still have to be on your own game?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yes, Rory is the best golfer in the world right now and it's not looking like he's going to falter but if he does, someone's going to be there to take it.   I'll try and stay as close to him as I can.   Hopefully he's not going to run away too far before the end of the day.
