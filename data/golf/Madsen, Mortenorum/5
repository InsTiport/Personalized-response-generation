 Q.   I take it 7‑under is a lovely return at the halfway stage, isn't it?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yes, very happy with that.   Yesterday I was scoring really well and probably not hit being as many fairways and as many greens as I should, but I was really scoring well.   
Today I was actually hitting the ball a lot better, hitting more fairways and more greens but couldn't really get the putts to go up.   In the end, I finished birdie on 17 and eagle on 18, so that was a nice way to finish off the round.   I kept my patience well.  
   
 Q.   And that's a rarity, the eagle on 18 so far.   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   It is, and I was sort of in between a hybrid and a 3‑wood for the second shot, but I ended up hitting a little 3‑wood and hit it to a foot and a half.   That's always nice to see a shot come off.   
   
 Q.   I appreciate the defence at Glendower at the SA Open probably didn't go the way you wanted, but do you feel the benefit of playing last week?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   I do.   Last week obviously I would have loved to have defended a little bit better and played a better, but I still had a great week.   It was really special to come back for the first time and try and defend your title.   
And I had some great experiences playing with Ernie, especially on Saturday, was a treat.   He's someone that I've been looking up to since I was a little boy, so it was really special to play with him and he couldn't have been nicer.   Yeah, that was really special.   
   
 Q.   It's certainly been some players saying how tough the rough is, but having gone through what you went through at the SA Open, I think this looks easy, doesn't it?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Exactly.   Me and SÃ¸ren Hansen were playing a practice round on Tuesday and we both played last week and we both felt like we could step on the tee and let it go rather than steer it.   
The rough was so good last week, if you missed the fairways, eight out of ten times you were not getting to the green.   This week, obviously there's spots that can be really penal, as well.   Most places you've got a shot at getting it on the green or at least around the green.   
So I feel a little more freer on the tee box this week, for sure.
