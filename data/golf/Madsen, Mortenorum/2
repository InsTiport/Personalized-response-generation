 Q.   Your thoughts then on the way that you finished, because that is a good, tidy finish after a tricky start?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yeah, you know what, I got off to a horrible start obviously.   I was a bit nervous and just let it get to me a little bit.   But yeah, I turned it around pretty well and played pretty solidly most of the round but obviously the finish was pretty horrible as well.   So I'm a bit disappointed.   
   
 Q.   You are tied fourth which is nice at this championship.   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Just right now, I'm really very disappointed in the way that I finished, but when I sit back and reflect, I'll be happy with the way I played.   It was a cool day playing with two such great players in Lee and Rory, and you know, a really enjoyable day and something I'll look back on for sure.  
   
 Q.   When you do get the chance to reflect, you'll know that this is a major step in your life and career, really?  
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yeah, it is.   I haven't been in many of these last groups with such great players, so it's a good experience for me and hopefully next time I'll perform a bit better, because I didn't have my best today.  
   
 Q.   You rallied superbly after the start.   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   I did.   I did really well on the front nine.   I was really, really happy and pleased to turn at even par but the back nine, I didn't take my chances on 10 and 13 and kind of messed up the last four holes.   A bit disappointed but I'll be all right in the end.  
   
 Q.   The rest comes on the plane, because you're straight off to KL.   
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yeah, I'll go back and pack up my stuff and take a shower and I'll be on my way to Malaysia to get used to the time difference.
