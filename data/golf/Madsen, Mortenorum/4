Q.   How does that compare to the low rounds you've shot in your career?
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   It's up there.   Definitely one of the best rounds I've played, yeah.   Feels great to finally shoot a good low one on The European Tour.   I think it beats my best score on The European Tour by a couple shots.   That feels good.

Q.   Did you have a feeling it was going to be a good day?
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   The first couple holes, I didn't hit very good shots.   Saved myself just with the short game.   Was even par through the first three, which are a couple birdie holes. 
So I didn't see a very special day coming but after that‑‑ I got it going after that and it got more and more solid, where I was only thinking about making birdies, not saving pars. 

Q.   Was there a particular highlight that said, this going is to be a really good, low one. 
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yeah, I birdied No. 4 with a really good putt and the next I hit a good drive, but not a great second shot.   I was sort of short‑sided left of the pin and I made that chip. 
So that was sort of a kick start to the round, you could say, and then the next hole, I was up‑and‑down from 30 yards, 30‑yard bunker shot.   That sort of kept the momentum going and on the back nine, I just started to make some really, really good putts.

Q.   You imagine you were positive at the start of the day anyway but you could have feared looking over your shoulder at the cut mark and now you're nicely placed?
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yes, of course.   Yesterday I was really poor off the tee but I saved myself and I salvaged the round really well.   Could have been a round where I shot 3‑ or 4‑over but I managed to get it to 1‑under, so that was really a positive for me. 
And to come out today, start to hit the ball better, and make some putts, that was a good feeling. 

Q.   Want to go out again?
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN:   Yeah, I sort of want to grab a sandwich and go play again because I have a really good feeling right now.
