MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN: It was a good victory.  I played well today, really well today.  Solid.  Didn't really make that many mistakes.  On the back nine obviously it was a lot tougher with the wind into, so we were struggling a bit more for par there than the front.  I kept the pressure on him most of the day.  It was good.
Q. I take it, it's always good to get it done in good time, as well.  Not out on the course for too long.
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN: Yeah, it was nice to keep it pretty stress free.  I wasn't sure of the victory until the end, but I had a nice cushion most of the way and luckily for me I hit some good shots the last couple of holes and closed it out.  It was good.
Q. What is your experience in match play and do you enjoy this format?
MORTEN ÃRUM MADSEN: I do quite enjoy match play.  Back home in Denmark, growing up as an amateur and junior, we play a lot, a lot of match play, team competitions and individual competitions.  I played a lot of match play growing up and I really enjoy it.  It's a format that suits my game pretty well.
