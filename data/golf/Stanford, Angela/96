  Q. You played great. I think 13 was the hole. Is that what you were telling me?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: I think so. I felt like I had a handle on the match, but Becky was the longer hitter, and I knew if we went to 15 or even 17, I might be in trouble.   
 So I needed that birdie, that putt on 15, and then to finish it right there on 14 was big.  
  
  Q. Have you been watching the board to see what everybody's doing?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: A little bit. I mean, I think there's more board than there needs to be.   
  
  Q. Well, there's still a lot of golf to be played. Golf course dried out a little bit, a little bit more run in the fairways?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah. The wind was kind of coming from a direction, so it's playing good.  
  
  Q. Okay. Let's go over to 10. Congratulations.
