  Q. What was the toughest part about managing the wind?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: I think hitting it into the greens. I mean, obviously they were getting a lot more firm, and just the roll-out. I mean, you could hit the green and it could roll out to the back. So that was the hard part, is you know, you have to play, do you hit short? Do you hit on the green and let it go?   
  
  Q. Before I forget, the palm -- inaudible -- was it sharp?   
 ANGELA STANFORD: I didn't know those hurt that bad.  
  
  Q. What hole was that on?   
 ANGELA STANFORD: 16 green.   
  
  Q. I sort of overheard the TV interview, you said it was okay till the last four or five holes?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: I thought when we made the turn, it was going to get tough.   
 I don't really know what unplayable is. I think if balls are rolling off greens, it probably is unplayable. But until like the last four, three holes, it really started to feel like, hmmm, I don't know if we should be out here.  
  
  Q. Did any of your balls blow off or your partner's blow off?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: My partner, I think she lipped out on her last putt and it went back a good eight feet.   
  
  Q. In your mind, was it unplayable?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: I don't know. I mean, I don't know what that is. I don't know what that line is.   
 But I think, again, if you have balls on the green rolling into water, then maybe.   
  
  Q. And that did happen?   
 ANGELA STANFORD: On the last hole just now.   
  
  Q. Who did it happen to?   
 ANGELA STANFORD: The group behind.   
  
  Q. Did it happen to both of them?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: Just the one.   
  
  Q. So it sounds like the ladies who teed off before noon or right in that window lucked out, right? Everybody knew it was coming.   
 ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah. That's just the way it is. I mean, it's the luck of the draw. Last week, I went early/later, late/early, and missed the wind. As the year goes on, it all balances out. Unfortunately this week, it's a major, and I got a bad draw.   
 You've got to do the best with what you've got, and unfortunately, I've fought it for a good 14 holes and then just kind of lost it.   
  
  Q. Besides the palm, any other wind damage for you?   
 ANGELA STANFORD: No, we saw a couple of branches.
