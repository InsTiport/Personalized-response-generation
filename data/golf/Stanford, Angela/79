 Q. Based on your play, what's your strategy going into the final round?
 ANGELA STANFORD: Just keep my head down and keep playing. There's still a lot of golf and it's going to be a long day, so just keep hitting one shot at a time.

 Q. What are you thinking about out there?
 ANGELA STANFORD: Nothing. It's such a long day you can't really think about anything.
