 Q.   Very, very good week of golf.   Things to take away from the week?   
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, I played really well.   Today just didn't make the putts that I've been making.   Shot 5‑under, so it's not like I just fell over.   I just didn't make the putts I needed to.  
   
 Q.   Was it reading?   
ANGELA STANFORD:   I wasn't hitting it great today.   Kind of had some in‑between numbers, so just kind of a little bit of everything.   That's the way it goes.  
   
 Q.   Anything else in the round?   Anything with the bogeys that stuck out?   
ANGELA STANFORD:   No.   Just misclubed a couple of times.   Just didn't make good decisions.  
   
 Q.   Biggest thing to take away from the week?   
ANGELA STANFORD:   Overall my putting was really good.   So that's good and I hit it fairly decent.   Really windy week.   Yeah, a lot of good things.  
   
 Q.   Any consolation that it was someone‑‑ she played her mind out?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   She's been playing great.   She's having a great year, so it was bound to happen.   I just happened to be the one that caught the (indiscernible).   You knew it was going to happen eventually.   She's been playing great.
