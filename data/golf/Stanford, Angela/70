   ANGELA STANFORD: Well, I played very sloppy today. That's the good news. I can go in tomorrow and hope to improve. I have something to work towards. I'm just excited to have a chance.

 Q. What was the difference today when you say sloppy play? What was frustrating? 
 ANGELA STANFORD: I think I was too greedy all day trying to hit some shots I didn't have to, and when you don't execute them, it's sloppy. 
 I just kind of did some things that I wouldn't normally do.

 Q. One day, and then you kind of can draw off of what you were doing well in the first two rounds to kind of take into Sunday? 
 ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah, and I kind of did once I figured out what it was. Then I kind of -- so, at least I know what to look for tomorrow. 

 Q. Little different for you guys, tee time changed up because of the weather. Will that change anything in the round? 
 ANGELA STANFORD: Still get rained on, and then (Indiscernible). 

 Q. Completely understand. Wonderful. Thank you.
