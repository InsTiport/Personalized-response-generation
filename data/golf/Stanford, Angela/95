  Q. Did you expect that kind of round after yesterday, toughest end of the draw?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah. I think so. I think I got lucky with the draw. Yesterday I played the morning, and I feel like I didn't play very well yesterday, so I feel like I had that in me.   
  
  Q. Seems like looking at the leaderboard there's a lot of birdies out there. Is that a reflection of the way the course is playing, easy or?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: Any time the course is going to play hard and fast. Seems like the fairways are firming up, and some of the par-5s are reachable.   
 You have some wedges in your hands on the par-4s. As long as the greens stay somewhat receptive, then you can go low. But if the greens get firm, and they seem to be kind of firm, but if they get firmer, then I don't know how low it will be.   
  
  Q. So you don't necessarily expect the next two days to see what we've seen so far?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: It depends. They can put pins in some tricky places. If the greens get firm and they've put the pins behind ridges and on top of ridges, then the scores won't be as low, I don't think.   
  
  Q. A golfer today shot 62 out here. Does that surprise you at all?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: No. I thought the course was playing very scorable, and I'm not surprised.
