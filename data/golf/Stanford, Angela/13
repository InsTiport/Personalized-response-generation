Q. That was a rollercoaster finish:  eagle, double, birdie.  How did the putt on the t last not drop?
ANGELA STANFORD: I don't know.  The lake is over there, right?  I don't know.  Just never know.
All you can do is your best.  I tried hard, even after the disaster on 16.
So I tried.
Q. What happened on 16?
ANGELA STANFORD: I wasn't fully comfortable and then I just made a bad swing.
Q. And the eagle before that, what happened there?  Club and putt?
ANGELA STANFORD: Hit a 7-wood.  We had a similar situation maybe Friday when that tee was up.  I knew I needed to aim a little more right and it worked out.
Q. How much fun was it and how easy or difficult was it for you to keep a tight lid on emotions over the closing stretch?
ANGELA STANFORD: It's hard because obviously there are a lot of things going through your mind and emotions.  Everybody knows I'm an emotional person.
I'm learning.  Maybe that means I'm getting closer.
Q. And to do this on a last day of a major, how much sweeter is that?
ANGELA STANFORD: It's good, because it means the things I'm working on are working.
Q. Last question.  At one point we had four Americans in the top four spots on that leaderboard.
ANGELA STANFORD: That's great.  I love it.
