   THE MODERATOR:  Go over you round.  Obviously bogeyed (indiscernible) pretty exciting when you (indiscernible) last week. 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  You know, I think starting on No. 10 you have to be real patient.  And I had eventually 30 chances on the back nine, but the thing that my caddie was reminding me and I have to remind myself out here is that the Back 9 is tough. 
 You know, your best chances at birdie are probably on the front, so I just tried to stay patient on the back, and then fortunately I made birdie on the back. 
 THE MODERATOR:  What have been your strengths on this course?  This is a tough course with wind. 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  I'm hitting it pretty straight this week.  And that doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to hit a fairway, but it also means I'm not going to be extremely off line. 
 We're trying to pick targets that -- because if we are hitting it straight we're not going to get into a lot of trouble.  The fairways are hard to hit out here. 

 Q.  How crucial is it to hit it straight off the tee going to be this weekend? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  If the wind blows it's going to be a crap shoot.  The balls can go anywhere.  You can go through the fairways if they firm up again.  I think there's rain in the forecast.  I think it's still pretty crucial to hit it straight. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible.) 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  I'm excited.  It's a great tournament.  I have some friends here so I'm ready to go.
