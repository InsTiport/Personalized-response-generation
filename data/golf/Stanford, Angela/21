Q. Satisfied with the round, 2-under?
ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah.  Yeah.  Anytime you have rain delay and you have to come out and go back out and then it's still raining on you, I think those are hard days anyways.  I'm pleased that I got the last part of my round in.
Q. That's a good finish.
So, what does this delay do to the mindset for tomorrow?  There's some rain in the forecast again, might be a couple long days in a row.
ANGELA STANFORD: I'm glad I'm in the morning tomorrow, especially just to get out here and maybe get started and get some in, hopefully get the round in.
It looks like good chance we'll be playing a lot of holes on Saturday, which is fine.  So, I think I've learned that nothing I can do about it so I might not worry about it.
Q. Get a good feel for the golf course now?
ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah, but I think the USGA has a way of making you feel like you do and come the weekend you don't.  So, I felt like I had a good feel for it today.
Q. But your experience is probably a pretty good advantage for you.  You play well in this championship a lot.
ANGELA STANFORD: I like the way USGA puts on golf tournaments and like how they set golf courses up.  I love fast greens, big greens.  So, I think I just know it's going to be really hard and so I like the way they set it up.
Q. Thank you so much.
A
Yes.
