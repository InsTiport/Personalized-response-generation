Q. (Indiscernible.)
ANGELA STANFORD: (Crying.)  I can't.  I have no idea what just happened.
I'm grateful.  And so happy for everybody at home, everybody that's all cheered for me and never gave up on me.
I mean, God is funny.  He catches you off guard just when you think that maybe you're done.  It's amazing.
I mean, I don't think -- I couldn't have asked for it any other way.  It's not my plan, so it's pretty cool.
Q. A roller coaster at the end.  You eagle 15, double bogey the very next hole, and then a birdie; almost make the putt on 18.  Tell us how you managed to come back after that double at 16.
ANGELA STANFORD: You know, I know me very well and I did a bunch of stupid stuff, but deep down I'm a fighter, I'm a grinder, and I've always been that.
I just kept telling myself, You just got to be who you are.  And maybe you're not good at certain things, but you got to be who you are right now and you got to just fight.
Q. Your mother is fighting.  Do you have a message for her having watched you win a major championship?
ANGELA STANFORD: Glad she got to see it.  That's it.  She may be the first to drink out of the trophy.
Q. She may be drinking already.
ANGELA STANFORD: I hope so.
Q. Angela, congratulation.  You're a major champion in close to 80 major championship starts.
