  ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, today was definitely a battle.   I think if you look up the definition of grinding, you'd see a picture of me today, so that's good.   I've had a lot of confidence the last couple of weeks and kind of lost my swing today.   But sometimes that helps because I think, well, the next shot will be a better one.   The next shot is a new shot.   At least my confidence was up out there battling.  
   
 Q.   How weird is it to be chasing a 15‑year‑old?   
ANGELA STANFORD:   I didn't even know.   She's a good one.   So at least she's a great player, and she's played internationally.   So she's probably‑‑ her putter's probably hot.   You've got to be putting it well here.  
   
 Q.   We talked to Suzann and she said well, she said she was nervous after the 15th and she looked up at the leaderboard and saw her name at the top.   She said now I'm nervous.   Suzann said that may be a good thing for you guys.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   You never know.   I don't know her record.   I don't know how many times she's been in contention.   People react differently.   Some people play really well in contention and some people don't.   So I don't know.   I don't know her record.  
   
 Q.   It's unreal how she's come.   Do you remember back when you were 15 what you were doing?   Did you feel you could be good enough to be on a course like this or a Tour like this?   
ANGELA STANFORD:   I was a car hop at Sonic, so that's what I was doing.
