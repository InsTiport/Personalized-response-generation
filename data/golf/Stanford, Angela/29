Q. Angela, now a part of the largest comeback ever in the Solheim Cup history.  How sweet has today been for the U.S.?
ANGELA STANFORD: It's been so cool.  This group was so cool all week.  We really came together.  And it's the coolest team I've ever been a part of, and they never quit believing.  I had another tough week and they just said we're going to keep believing.  They were awesome.
Q. We knew with what happened this morning that everybody would be focused on whoever Suzann Pettersen was playing.  When you drew that name and to go out there and do what she did, how sweet is this moment?
ANGELA STANFORD: Well, it was more about Alison Lee.  I felt bad for her.  She is such a class act and she handled this week so well.  And getting to play with her Friday, I was impressed with how she handled herself.  It shouldn't have happened to her.  I think that's what made me the most mad.  A little bit of extra motivation.  But today everybody needed to win, so that's what I was thinking about.
Q. Were you aware as it was coming down that your match was such a critical point?
ANGELA STANFORD: No, I really didn't, because I didn't know -- I saw Gerina chipping on one of the video boards, and I knew that she had to make a putt because she was 1-up.  I didn't know what was going on there.  But I just kept thinking I've got to post mine.  So that was pretty cool.
Q. All week you guys have talked about Juli and what she's meant as a captain.  How big is this to be able to deliver a victory for her?
ANGELA STANFORD: She's a class act.  With everything that happened this week and has happened recently, she has handled it the best.  She's a class act.  And she deserved that today.  I'm happy to be a part of it.
