 Q.  Pretty convincing victory, has to feel good, two in a row now.  Just talk about your day? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Today I didn't make as many birdies, but I was more consistent.  I didn't make as many mistakes, either.  I think I might have been right around even par maybe, I don't know.  So just more consistent overall. 
 
 Q.  Does it probably change your mind-set when your opponent maybe isn't playing that well; maybe you're just trying to put it down the middle and get it on the green every time? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  I've learned my lesson.  When I try to be cautious, I don't end up being that way.  So it's just really important for me to keep doing what I'm doing.  I have to remember, I'm trying to make birdies regardless of what anyone else is doing. 
 
 Q.  Is there any point where you felt like you lapped it up today? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  No, I never feel that way.  Match-play strategy, golf, anything can happen. 

 Q.  Have you looked ahead to tomorrow at all? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  A little bit.  I know I'm possibly playing Maria or Paula.  So either one of those two ladies is going to be a tough match. 

 Q.  And the thought of playing 36 or if you could go on, 72 holes on the weekend; is that exciting for you?  Do you have to mentally prepare for that? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Yeah, I think you've got to, the mental part is most important.  I think physically I think all of us can do it and hold up.  But mentally and just knowing that it's going to be a long day, there's some incentive to try to get it over quick.
