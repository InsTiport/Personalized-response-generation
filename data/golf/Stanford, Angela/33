 Q.  Shot a nice one today, what are your general thoughts on the round?  ANGELA STANFORD: Felt pretty good about it.  Hit the ball really well.  Only missed one green.  Feel good about it.   Q.  So you feel good about how you set yourself up for the weekend?  ANGELA STANFORD: I think so.  I feel like it's only going to get tougher.  I think they could get pretty mean, I think, with the course setup.  I think it's tough either way.  But I think it's a great track.  I think by far one of the best picks recently.  It's a lot of fun.   Q.  It's records crowds out here.  Do you feel them behind you?  ANGELA STANFORD: It's awesome.  It's fun to see so many people.  Any time you get to play in front of a lot of people, you get a little more juiced up.  It's nice of them to come out.  The volunteers have been great too.   Q.  You said you felt good setting up to the weekend.  They are at minus 4 right now, the leaders.  Do you think you can make a run for that?  ANGELA STANFORD: I hope so.  That's the plan.  It will be interesting to see where we all go in for the weekend.  I thought it played -- the wind was coming from a different direction.  Today just was trying to judge the wind.  Never know
