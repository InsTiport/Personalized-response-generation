 Q.   So hometown event.   Came out, pretty good first round.   Just take me through the day.   Obviously a few people following you out here.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah.   It was nice, I think, to get off in the morning, just kind of found a rhythm early and tried to be patient, and I know anything can happen on this course.   
It was nice to have a bunch of people out.   Seems like every day we have more and more.  
   
 Q.   You talked on Tuesday just about some of the simple pleasures of being able to lay by your own pool, sleep in your own bed.   Has there been anything else this week that's kind of reminded you how much you love being home?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   I think getting in your own car and going to your own house and then cooking at home.   Obviously we don't get to do that much on the road and I don't do it much at home anyway.   
I thought about that today because I'm asking people where they're eating, and this is the most I guess I've had at home in a long time.  
   
 Q.   We went to Joe T. Garcia's last night.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   I saw a picture on Twitter.   That place is awesome.  
   
 Q.   Really good.   Last one, you're 2â€‘under, 70 today.   So obviously you're in the mix.   I don't want to put you too far ahead, but how nice would it be to be in the mix on Sunday here with the hometown crowd?   You must have thought about it.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   It would be cool just because I think a lot of people would come out, and I think that would be cool for this tournament to have a real good turnout the first year.   So I'm going to try and be up there and get a few fans out.
