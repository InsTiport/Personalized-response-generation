  THE MODERATOR:   Good round today.   Take me through what you did well.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   A few things I think I did better today.   I drove the ball better and I was putting a lot better.   
I think any time you give yourself a chance from the fairway, then you're probably going to have more opportunities for birdie.   
I got comfortable on the greens early, was just rolling it a lot better than I have been.   
THE MODERATOR:   Chella said it started raining on you all pretty hard out there.   Did that affect you at all?   
ANGELA STANFORD:   No.   We knew it was coming.   When you know it's in the forecast, it doesn't surprise you.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Angela.   
   
 Q.   Did it actually serve to help you?   Did it get soft on the greens where you could just go for it?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   I thought they were soft all day.   Did it rain this morning also?   
I think it helped because Tuesday when we played 9, I thought it was firm and fast.   I think everybody thought the rain would help it a little bit, soften it up.   I think everybody was okay with it raining out there.   
   
 Q.   You were in a pretty successful group today.   Did that help you to stay competitive or don't you pay attention to what the other players are doing?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   I usually don't pay attention.   But as a whole, when a group is making a lot of birdies, it just seems like everybody's playing good.   Usually that feels a lot better than everybody playing bad.   
But I think as a whole, the group played really well.   Sometimes I think that helps.   
THE MODERATOR:   The LPGA took a year off here last year.   How does it feel to be back in Toledo?   
ANGELA STANFORD:   It feels great.   It's nice to come back to events that have tradition built in the community and the fans are so supportive.   It just feels really good because, you know, I think the one thing that our schedule can use more of is tradition, and tournaments like this really help that.   
So it's nice to come back.   It's great to come to a familiar place.   I enjoy it.   
   
 Q.   I don't know what your tee time will be tomorrow.   You will probably have an earlier tee time.   Do you like that?   Would you prefer to get on the road, depending what the weather might do, get on and off the course?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, I think anytime you can get out there and try to move up the leaderboard, get off the course, I think that's good.   
For me, I'm not much of a morning person.   I don't know if that's the right thing to say.   I'm not a morning person, so sometimes it takes me a couple holes to wake up.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right, Angela, thank you.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   Thank you.
