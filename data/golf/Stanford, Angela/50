 Q.   Probably not the way you wanted to finish with the bogey, but still at the U.S. Open, you are hanging in there?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, it's nice to be under par going into Sunday.   Obviously anything can happen, especially on this golf course.   If the wind continues to blow like this and if they have the pin placements that they did today, anything can happen.  
  
 Q.   You've got a lot of experience in a Women's Open and you have contended before, so that's got to play into your favor probably for tomorrow?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, you know, I'm thinking eight shots depending on what she does on 18.   Eight shots is a lot to chase the No. 1 player in the world.   I was hoping to figure out a way to get to 4 or 5 back and so, unless a miracle happens tomorrow it's going to be pressie tough.  
  
 Q.   It's got to be a fine balance, because you know you have got to catch her but par is not going to be enough?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   The few times today that I tried to be a little more aggressive got me in trouble.   So that makes it really hard going into tomorrow thinking that I need to be aggressive but I kind of got burned on it today.  
  
 Q.   Was it because you missed the greens in the wrong places?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, and then hit some bad shots around the greens.  
This last hole and then on 8, I just hit a chip that didn't catch the ridge.   Now you are on top of the ridge putting down the slope.   So just left myself in a couple of bad spots.
