 Q.  Great match, Angela.  After that point, how did you feel? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Good.  Good.  I know it's important for to us get as many points on the board as possible.  So, that's what I was trying to do. 

 Q.  Very good.  You gave your teammates the momentum to bring them on to victory. 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  I hope so. 

 Q.  Better weather today? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Little better. 

 Q.  What did you think were the key points of the match? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Probably the shot on 9 that I had to get it to the middle of the green and then the birdie on 11.  Probably those two. 

 Q.  Did you start to worry there the last couple holes? 
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Well, match play is never over until it's over.  Obviously Trish is a great player and she's done this -- I don't even know how many years she's been here, so she's got a lot of fire.  I knew that, you know, it was going to be a long day. 

 Q. You played great today.  Thank you very much.
