MODERATOR:  Well, Angela, thanks for coming in and speaking with us.

You birdied 18 to get within one shot of the lead.  You'll play in the last group with Janice tomorrow.  Just talk about that, going after the win tomorrow.
ANGELA STANFORD:  It's been a long time since I've been one shot back going into the final round.  So, you know, in a way it's    I don't know what to expect tomorrow.  I know that we are going to be extremely focused on our game plan that we've had all week.

Like I said, it's been a while.  I don't know what to expect.  I expect nerves.  But I don't know.  We'll see.  If I stick to my game plan, we should be okay.
MODERATOR:  Can you take us over your scorecard?  We'll start at birdie on 7.
ANGELA STANFORD:  I was kind of lucky on that one.  Ill hit a 9 iron off the tee, and it looked like the wind started to knock it down as it got to the front of the green.  I expected it to hit the water.  And somehow it hit the other side and kicked up to like 5 feet.  Made that putt.

9, made bogey on 9.  I didn't realize my tee shot went all the way through the fairway.  Had a funny lie there, and then I had a funny lie on the chip shot.  So then I missed the putt.
MODERATOR:  So you chipped for your second shot?
ANGELA STANFORD:  Chipped for my third shot on No. 9.
MODERATOR:  What was the second shot?
ANGELA STANFORD:  Second shot I had an 8 iron, but we were in the rough.
MODERATOR:  And then chipped    and do you know how far that par putt was?
ANGELA STANFORD:  At least 20 feet.
MODERATOR:  Then you had the eagle on 14?
ANGELA STANFORD:  Yeah.  That was a pretty good 4 iron that I hit out of the fairway.  I hadn't hit a good shot since the tee shot on 11.  Just I was starting to get a little frustrated, didn't take advantage of No. 12, the par 5.  Made a bad swing on 13 and bad swing off the tee on 14.

And just really kind of pulled it together and    I mean, I need to hit a good one here, and just drilled the 4 iron.  I hadn't hit it like that yet.  So it was neat.  It hit right on the front and rolled to about five feet.
MODERATOR:  And bogey on 17?
ANGELA STANFORD:  I've had a hard time with that tee shot all week on the par 3.  And didn't make a good swing again and didn't get up and down.
MODERATOR:  What did you hit off the tee?
ANGELA STANFORD:  5 iron.
MODERATOR:  Into front bunker?
ANGELA STANFORD:  Yes, the left front bunker.  And hit a pretty decent sand shot, and then it was    I shouldn't have been above the flag.
MODERATOR:  But then you bounced right back with the birdie on 18.
ANGELA STANFORD:  Yeah.  I told my caddie on the third shot    well, the second shot I told him where I wanted to be, and we hit a good second shot.  The third shot, before I hit it, I go, All right, I want this one pretty bad.  So hit a good gap wedge to    was it about 10 feet?
MODERATOR:  Right around there.
ANGELA STANFORD:  And rolled it in.
MODERATOR:  We'll go ahead and take questions.
Q.  Angela, could you just talk about the conditions out there with the wind?  It seems like it's pretty tricky to try to figure out where it's coming from out there.
ANGELA STANFORD:  Yeah.  I thought yesterday, I think, was the easiest day for the wind.  Today it was gusty.  It hasn't really been gusty like that.  But I thought it was a similar wind that we had in the practice round.  So it was actually the best wind, I think, all week.
Q.  Just want to get your thoughts on playing in the final group with Janice.
ANGELA STANFORD:  I'm excited.  I haven't played in the final group in a while.  I know Janice is a great player.  I don't know.  I'm just excited about it.  Just the chance to win, being one back, haven't had this opportunity.

I've been playing well for    this is my 7th week in a row.  And ever since the Open, I felt like I've been hitting it well enough to win.  So it will be interesting to see how I react tomorrow.  I feel like I've been building this momentum, and so I'm excited.
Q.  What would winning this one    or what would winning mean to you at this point?
ANGELA STANFORD:  Well, they say it's    I hear people say winning the second one is harder than the first one.  And I would agree with that 100 percent.  I think to win the second one would just kind of reaffirm and confirm the first one was not a fluke.

But, you know, I think to win in Canada also, I    you know, I haven't played a ton out of the States, you know, just here and there.  So I enjoy playing golf here.  This is only my third time to play in Canada.  So it would mean a great deal right now.
MODERATOR:  Any more questions?  Thank you, Angela.
ANGELA STANFORD:  Thanks.
