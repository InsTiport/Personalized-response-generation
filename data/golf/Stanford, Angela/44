Q.   Angela, very solid opening round?
ANGELA STANFORD:   I played well all day, and I had some chances on the back.   For me, it's more about position off the tee and I drove it well today and I hit a lot of fairways and put myself in good position.   That allowed me to maintain my game a little bit more. 

Q.   We've seen some good scores from you in 2014.   What's different about Angela Stanford in 2014?
ANGELA STANFORD:   New year, new mindâ€‘set.   I think in the beginning of the year, you have a fresh, new slate, so sometimes that's good. 

Q.   It's your 14th year on Tour, so you've obviously become wiser over the years. 
ANGELA STANFORD:   They say, yeah.   My friends say "wise" something else (laughing).

Q.   You won here a couple of years ago but on a very different golf course.   They have all talked about the green speed, it's rolling at 12, so anything above the hole, it's a lot faster than that?
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, and I'm okay for green speed.   Last year was tough for me.   It took me a little bit to get used to the golf course and I still am.   Today was a great day but there's still some land mines out there for me.   It's going to be an interesting three more days.
