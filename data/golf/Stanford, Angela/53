 Q.   What are your impressions of your round?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   Probably let one get away there.   I mean I had a lot of opportunities on our front side which was the back nine, and just missed a chance to get into a better position.  
   
 Q.   And you did put yourself in position quite a bit on the front.   I followed you through the front nine.   Was it reading the greens?   What was the ‑‑  
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, just I guess it was a combination of maybe not having the correct speed and not reading them properly.  
   
 Q.   And what do you think you need to do tomorrow to put yourself ‑‑  
ANGELA STANFORD:   I guess I just have to keep being patient.   I think I probably lost my patience there in the end, and you know, it's a tough course with the greens and the fairways being this firm and fast.   
You kind of have to be patient, and I thought I did my best, and I kind of lost it there in the end.  
   
 Q.   And the conditions were a little different than they were yesterday.   Was it especially with the wind?  
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, the wind, it blew from a similar direction, but I think it started blowing a little bit harder towards the end today.   So I think any time it blows like that later in the afternoon, it's just making things a lot firmer and faster.   
And the ball for some reason was going a lot further later in the day, too.  
   
 Q.   Do you have to ‑‑ do you enter tomorrow thinking about what if?   Is that something ‑‑  
ANGELA STANFORD:   No.   Just gotta get over it and keep going.   I don't even know what the leader is.   What's the leader?   
   
 Q.   7.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   Leader's at 7?   
   
 Q.   She bogeyed three of the last four.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   Oh.   So anybody's ball game now.   
   
 Q.   See, your whole attitude just changed.   
ANGELA STANFORD:   It just changed like that.   I thought I was like 6 or 7 down.
