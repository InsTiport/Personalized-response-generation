Q. 6-under today.  What was the key to the strong play?
ANGELA STANFORD: A little bit of everything.  Hit it really well, probably the best I've ever hit it here and I putted the ball the best I think I've ever putted here.
Everything.  Felt good from the start.  Was a lot of the fun to finally play good here.
Q. Any difference leading up to this week compared to other times at Evian?
ANGELA STANFORD: Not that I can think of.  I'm definitely working on some things.  This year hasn't really been what I wanted it.  Kind of starting to work on things since I have some time.
Not going to play kind of half of the Asia events, so it's kind of a chance to start working on some things.
Q. How different is that for you, to be able to take a little bit of time off and fine tune your game going into the last few events of the year?
ANGELA STANFORD: I like it.  I like it.  I think I've learned that you push all year long and before you know it it's September and you didn't even realize it.
I've tried to be more aware of that and maybe stopping and reassessing and starting to work on things before December.
Q. Then general thoughts on the course:  What does it take to be successful out here?
ANGELA STANFORD: This course is hard.  You definitely have to put your ball in the right spot off the tee, into the green.
If you get on the wrong side of one of those mounds on the green you're in deep trouble.  You have to put your ball in the right spot.
