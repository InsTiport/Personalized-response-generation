Q.   Congratulations.   Sum up your day for us?
ANGELA STANFORD:   It was a long day.   You know, there were moments where I thought I was done. 
You know, I kind of hit it all over the map at times, and you know, my caddie's been on me for the last couple of weeks telling me to keep my head on and keep grinding away, and we didn't know it would take this long, but it was a grind all day.

Q.   In terms of your overall career, how highly do you rate this victory?
ANGELA STANFORD:   Well, I haven't won a major yet, so this is the closest thing so far.   The best players in the world are here and they call it Asia's major, so it's the closest thing to me.

Q.   Going to 18 did you think you'd have a chance of winning at that stage before the lightning?
ANGELA STANFORD:   To be perfectly honest, no.   I've always had a tough time with 18, and nobody birdies it, even in the playoff.   So it's a tough finishing hole.

Q.   So do you think experience won for you?
ANGELA STANFORD:   I think it helped.   I mean I felt for Jenny because I've been there, and you have to be patient and you have to just kept in there.   I just said I'm just going to try to be the last person standing.
