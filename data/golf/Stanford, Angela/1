  Q. How was it playing U.S. Women's Open in your home state?
 ANGELA STANFORD:   It was a lot of fun.  Obviously wanted to play better, but I just was not hitting it good the last two days.
 But it was fun.  It's fun to kind of jump in the car and just drive home though.  (Laughter.)
 Q. What did you like most about Champions and being in Houston?
 ANGELA STANFORD:   You know, the golf courses are great.  Love seeing Robin and Jack Burke.  I hope a lot of players get to talk to them and get some of the history.
 I think it's cool when the USGA picks venues like this that we get to learn something, too.  And everything just seemed bigger.  USGA did a great job.  Hospitality was great.
 I don't know if it was because we're in Texas and they just had big expectations it fill, but they did.  I thought they did great.
