Q. That was a huge win out of you.  Do you realize you're part of an American team that overcame the largest deficit in the history of the Solheim Cup?
ANGELA STANFORD: That's awesome.  It's so fitting for this group.  This is probably the closest knit group we've ever been a part of.  We never stopped believing.  It's been a long road for me personally.  And I tried to be the best teammate this week.  And they picked me up and I just fought for them.
Q. You knew all about that controversy early this morning between Alison Lee and Suzann Pettersen not giving the putt.  Was that extra motivation or did you need that today?
ANGELA STANFORD: You don't need it, but Alison is a class act, and that's what bothered me.  Alison has handled this week perfectly.  And she's a competitor.  She's respectful of the game and that's what bothered me the most, what they did to her.  She didn't deserve that and that's what made me mad.
Q. Is this the greatest victory you've ever had in your life, even with all the wins you've had on the LPGA Tour?
ANGELA STANFORD: This tops it all.  Juli deserved this today, and that's all I can say.  Juli deserved it.  She is a class act.  She deserved it.
