 Q. I'm here with Angela Stanford. One of the most special moments of the week for you had to be your mother that's been struggling with breast cancer made the trip to be with you. 
 ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah. They drove up, I think they left Wednesday, got here Thursday, and it was pretty cool because a couple of months ago we didn't think she would be here. Pretty special, pretty cool turn of events to get her here. 

 Q. What was your conversation like with her this morning as you made your way to the golf course?
 ANGELA STANFORD: Well, I just sent them a text and told them what time I was coming, and I actually didn't get hers till afterwards. 
 The text that meant the most was Friday night, because I lost two points, and she sent me a great text, and I told one of my friends, only a mom could send you that kind of text and make you feel that good. It was great to have her here.

 Q. Well, we wish you a lot of luck in your endeavors, and we hope your mom feels better soon.
