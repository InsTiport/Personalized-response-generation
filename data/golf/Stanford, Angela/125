  Q.  One of many playoff matches, and you won.  Just talk about that last hole and almost made that putt to win it yourself and then for her to miss, talk about that.   
 ANGELA STANFORD:  I think you always expect them to make it, and I was really trying to make my birdie putt because you just don't expect people to miss.   
 And so I just didn't think she would miss because she's been putting really well today.   
  
  Q.  Can you just talk about your round a little bit where you were good, where you were bad?   
 ANGELA STANFORD:  I think I just kept impatient.  I started really strong and once I could settle into the round, I get impatient.  And I think that's just what happened, 7, 8, 9, 10, I just kind of expected more out of how I was playing.  So just need to be a little more patient.   
  
  Q.  Was there any point where you felt you were in control?   
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Right off the bat, I birdied the first two holes and lipped in, and she fought back and she played really well.  I didn't feel like I had any control again until No. 16.   
  
  Q.  And your outlook going into tomorrow, just happy to be here?   
 ANGELA STANFORD:  Yeah, happy to get the first one under my belt and show up tomorrow.
