Q. 68 today, four birdies on your card.  You must be delighted with how you played.
ANGELA STANFORD: I am.  I felt like I kind of scrapped it around.  I didn't feel like I hit the ball as well as I did yesterday, so the putter feels good, rolling it good, so happy with it.
Q. You parred out the back nine, nine pars in a row.  Tell us about that.
ANGELA STANFORD: I think that's a product of not hitting it where I want to.  I had to get up-and-down more on the back.  It just didn't feel like it did yesterday, but like my caddie said, you're missing it in the right spots.
Q. A couple low scores out there, I think 6-under is the low today.  Did you feel like this was perhaps the easiest the course has played so far?
ANGELA STANFORD: I don't know if this course ever plays easy, so I don't know.  I didn't think so because I think it's always hard.
Q. You put yourself in a great position obviously for the final round.  How do you feel going into it?
ANGELA STANFORD: I think we've got a long ways to go.  Unfortunately I only have 18 more holes, but I'll try and track it down tomorrow.
Q. Talk about the mentality of the way this tournament has changed.  Did it change your approach at all?
ANGELA STANFORD: No, you're still trying to make as many birdies as possible.  I think the difference with this golf course is you can make a big number quick.  I think you have to make birdies but then you really have to be more careful because you have one less day to make it up.
