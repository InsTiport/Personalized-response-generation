 Q. for the record, 63, just talk about it. 
 ANGELA STANFORD: It was a great day. You know, I love this golf course. It's a great setup for me, and you know, I think if you place the ball in the correct spots, you know, you can go low. 
 But I hit a lot of great putts today. 

 Q. Obviously you like it here and you won here in '08. What about it suits your game?
 ANGELA STANFORD: I just think you have to be -- you have to be hitting the ball solid. And you have to place it. And then the greens are very fair, and you can make putts, but you have to get it there. 
 So it's a classic golf course. I love it. I wish we had, you know, a gajillion of those on our tour, because it's just wonderful golf course; traditional, classic.
