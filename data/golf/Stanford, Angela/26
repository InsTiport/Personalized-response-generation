Q. So yesterday when you were talking to Al you talked about you'll see if it's easier in the morning than in the afternoon.  Did you feel like it was a little bit?
ANGELA STANFORD: No.  I think it's easier in the afternoon, because it gets a little bit warmer, ball runs out a little bit more.
Seemed like this morning having to hit a little bit more club; not as much breeze.
I think it's tougher in the morning around here.
Q. You had a good finish here.  Confidence is obviously...
ANGELA STANFORD: I did?
Q. Yeah.  Three birdies in the last five holes.  Good finish here today.  You played well last week.  Can you talk about the confidence heading into the next round and then also beginning of a major?
ANGELA STANFORD: You know, it's been a tough year, and so the fact that it's kind of starting to turn, it's one of those things that as a golfer you believe that's going to happen.  It's nice to actually see it.
But a few things have started to kind of click a little bit.  Hopefully it keeps going.  Hopefully the major lands at the perfect time for me.
I can't think about all that, but I'm happy that things are going the other direction.
Q. Do you think it was the visit to the White House that really...
ANGELA STANFORD: It could have been.  It could have been the visit to the white houses that did it, too.
