Q.   Just talk about your a little bit about your round today, 3 under, two shots from the lead right now.
ANGELA STANFORD: The ball finally started going in the hole.  I haven't hit it that close, I think 9 out of 14 greens I hit I was 15 feet or in.  I finally started hitting it close and the ball finally started going in.  I got some good breaks.  I didn't always hit it good to get it that close.  It was one of those days that finally everything was going the way you always hope it would.
Q.   Talk a little bit about the course and the shape it's in and your thoughts about playing out here.
ANGELA STANFORD: I really like the golf course.  It looks great.  It's in great shape.  The greens are     they hold your balls, but they're fast.  I love those kind of greens.  You get the kind of penalized for not hitting it where you're supposed to hit it, but that's the way a Major golf could should be.
Q.   Tell me a little bit about your back side.  You had a little trouble there at the end of the front side but then had a couple of birdies in a row to get you going again.
ANGELA STANFORD: I doubled ten and had a really good shot, but the wind didn't below it back into the green, and I was like only 20 feet from the flag, but out of that rough you never know where it's going.  I made double from there, and I think I birdied 13 and 14, just hitting it close.

13 I actually missed it a little bit.  I just took the slope; and 14, I probably hit the best shot of the day with a gap wedge; and then 17 had a good 6 iron.
Q.   All right, good deal.  Thanks.
