Q. Anything in the off‑season change?   Anything different?   I know you're cutting back on events. 
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah, I am cutting back, but I think that's given me a little more energy.   I still enjoy to play.   I love being out here and playing and competing.
But I just don't know if I'm cut out to travel like that.   If anything, it's reenergized me.   Makes me feel like the tournaments I do play I'm excited to be there.

Q.   Is it tougher to say, All right, game mode, when you go for bigger breaks?
ANGELA STANFORD:   No, no.

Q.   Just turn it on?
ANGELA STANFORD:   I'm lucky because I play in the 1:00 at home and those guys keep me on my toes.

Q.   Same group for a while?   Same group of guys?
ANGELA STANFORD:   Yeah.

Q.   That's great.   How long have you guys been playing?
ANGELA STANFORD:   They've had the game forever.   It's just on the weekends, Friday, Saturday, Sunday at 1:00.   You never know who is going to show up, but it's good for me because the guys play to their handicaps. 
It's a team.   You have to have a couple best balls.   So it's good for me.   Keeps me in a scoring mode.

Q.   Love it.   Anything else today that stuck out obviously other than the hole‑in‑one?   Pretty straightforward?
ANGELA STANFORD:   No. 

Q.   All right, well, that's all I needed.
