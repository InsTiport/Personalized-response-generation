  Q. Great playing, finished at 4-under. Everybody is talking about the Ben Hogan connection. If you can just talk about that a little bit.   
 ANGELA STANFORD: Well, just being from Fort Worth and being a part of Shady Oaks and being able to call Shady Oaks home is really special. It's an honour to get to represent them and to be here and to know that Mr. Hogan won here, it's cool. So just trying to enjoy it and appreciate it this week.  
  
  Q. If you can talk about the conditions during your round and how they changed throughout the round.   
 ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah, we got really lucky off the bat. I was actually hot. I wish I had shorts on, and the wind really wasn't blowing at all. We got lucky for about 12, 13 holes. So nice to have a good tee time this morning.  
  
  Q. And then thoughts going into tomorrow?  
 ANGELA STANFORD: Well, I mean, I don't know what the weather is going to be. It all depends on the wind. I think if the wind starts to blow here, it kind of becomes anybody's ballgame. I'm happy to be in at 4-under, but I know that we still have three more days.
