Q. You kind of back-doored your way into a top 10 here.  How was your day out there?
ANGELA STANFORD: I hope it stays in the top 10.  You know, all week it just seemed like I couldn't get a putt to go in.  I've hit it great all week, and I don't know what happened.  I kind of gave myself a stern talking-to on No. 9 and just said, you know, basically, let's go.  Stop it, knock it off, let's knock it in the hole.  And then finally made them on the back.  I guess once you see one go in, you think they can all go in.  It was a solid back nine.
Q. Solheim coming up here, is that in the forefront of your mind here, especially in a good finish?
ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah, it has been all year, so I'm kind of ready to know.  I'm kind of ready for these next two weeks to kind of be done, and I'm going to give it everything I've got, and it is what it is.
