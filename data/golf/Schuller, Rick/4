Q.  You were out there today playing in a major; how was that for you? 

RICK SCHULLER:   This is my fourth one now.  I've played in two U.S. Opens, 1986 and 1988 and Atlanta in 2001, and this is a totally different beast.  This golf course is so punishing.  I started off the day, almost made a 2, I hit it about three inches on 1.  Any tee balls that don't find the fairway, you're hacking it out. 

It got to be, I made a triple on a hole, the 12th hole, and I was playing smart, to lay up, and found myself in just a horrible lie.  And then just kept getting worse, but that's what this golf course can do to you.  But after I got past 15, my goal was just to make 80 at that point because I had heard the scores were real high.  I still don't know how I stand in relation to the rest of the field. 

We talked amongst ourselves and we hit a lot of good shots, the club pros, but it is so punishing that you just have to deal with it. 


Q.  Are you happy with 79? 

RICK SCHULLER:   Obviously not. 


Q.  Did you leave a lot of shots out there?

RICK SCHULLER:   I missed some makeable birdie putts, but there wasn't a whole lot out there.  I think I had one birdie today and it was a three-inch putt.  That's it.  I felt good about par on 17 and par on 18. 


Q.  Will you change anything going into tomorrow?

RICK SCHULLER:   No, just got to try and somehow  -- I know I played with Dave Tennison and I think he hit driver twice today, which I might veer back from hitting my driver.  It kind of stresses you out when you know that you have to put it in play.  This golf course gets fast and the fairways don't hold, there's no telling what anybody will shoot here.
