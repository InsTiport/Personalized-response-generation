 Q.  Thoughts on that?  
GEORGIA HALL: Pretty rubbish to be honest.  Level par is okay, but I think I played worse than that.  I got some really good up-and-downs and managed to get a birdie on the last to make it level.  I'll try and shoot a low one tomorrow now.   
 Q.  Did you get too much sleep last night?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, 13 hours.  That's the problem.  I didn't think that maybe teeing off this morning that I got too much.   
You know, it was really windy for us this afternoon.  I tried to go for it a bit on the back nine and made one or two mistakes.  But you know, a low one tomorrow and see what happens.   
 Q.  Certainly not disastrous, I think you're five off.  It's really not a disastrous day, is it?  
GEORGIA HALL: No, I was hoping for a bit better, but if I hole some putts tomorrow, you know, kind of see where I place after that.
