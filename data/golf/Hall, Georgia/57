Q. How does it feel to be officially named the Order of Merit winner on the LET?
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, it's been a long year and I'm so happy to be able to win it.  I think I've played great this year and I've had some really good results.  It's one of my targets at the start of this year and I'm over the moon.
Q. You've had an incredible season:  Seven Top-10s, Solheim Cup appearance and two Top-10s in majors.  What are your best memories of 2017?
GEORGIA HALL: Definitely Solheim Cup was one of the biggest for me.  Third at the British Open was big.  You know, second in Abu Dhabi, I love it there, so I always enjoy going back there.  I think this is kind of one of the biggest moments, as well, winning the Order of Merit.
Q. You've had some really big moments in Dubai.  You love the tournament.  How do you look back on this week?
GEORGIA HALL: You know, it's been great.  I think coming from the Tour school, it's made it a little bit harder for me.  But I just enjoyed this week and I love playing this golf course, so had great fun.
Q. No doubt bigger and better things to come.  What are your goals for 2018?
GEORGIA HALL: I'd like to become Rookie of the Year on the LPGA.  I still want to play a few events on the LET in between and do better in the majors, and have a more consistent year this year.
Q. What do you think of your watch?
GEORGIA HALL: I think it's amazing.  I think I'll definitely wear it.  It's much better than I expected, I don't know, so I'm very happy.
