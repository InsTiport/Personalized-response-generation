 Q.  Did you ever expect your first big breakthrough to come here at the Women's British Open?  
GEORGIA HALL: No, not at all.  I've always joked by saying I haven't really won -- if I win a major, it will be my first win, and I can't believe it's actually true.  I don't think it's sunk in yet.  I just told myself to stay calm the whole way and not think about anything.  I thought I would cry but -- no, I'm just over the moon.   
 Q.  To win not only your first event but your first major championship, walking up the 18th with a three-stroke lead, what were the emotions?  
GEORGIA HALL: The putt on the last, as well -- I was like, I'll take a 3-putt here.  I'm so over the moon.   
 Q.  You're the first English winner of this championship since Karen Stupples.  What did that historical moment mean to you?  
GEORGIA HALL: Incredible.  I had so much support today from all the people backing me and supporting me and cheering my name, and the support, I'm just so grateful.
