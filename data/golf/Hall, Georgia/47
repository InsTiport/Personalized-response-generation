Q. First career start, Round 1 here at the Cambia Portland Classic, out in 33, back in 33.  Nine birdies to start off the round for the week.  How are you feeling out there today?
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, it was great.  I hit the ball really close.  Had quite a few tap-ins for birdies, which was really good.  I had some really good putts, and I think I still had maybe three bogeys.  To shoot 6-under first round, I'm very happy with that.
Q. Talk about the course conditions today.  The weather was very different from last week.  How comfortable were you out there today?
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, it was hardly any wind, and it was far easier.  The greens are quite soft.  It's an amazing golf course, it's in great condition.  Hopefully the weather stays like this for the next two or three days.
Q. After your win at the Ricoh Women's British Open, that kind of elevated you into a different caliber with other major champions, you played with In Gee and Pernilla today.  How does it elevate your game?
GEORGIA HALL: It was amazing.  They are really nice people, first off, and amazing players.  We had really a lot of fun out there and I had a great group.  That's always nice.  Makes the rounding quicker.
