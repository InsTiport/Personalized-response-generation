Q. Are you looking forward to playing with Charley in the last match team?
GEORGIA HALL: Me and Charley, yeah, we used to play together for England when we were, like, ten, 11 years old.  We were playing together and so it's quite special, hole in hole pairing.  I think we've got similar games, very aggressive, hit it quite long.  So I'm actually very excited to pair with Charley this afternoon.
Q. Would you like to play in all five matches this week?
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, of course.  Whatever is best for the team.  If I'm playing well, I'm happy to go out wherever Annika wants me to go out.
