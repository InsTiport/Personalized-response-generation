 Q.  Start of the day, bet you'd have taken that, wouldn't you?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I kind of struggled on the back nine today but I played okay.  Just some approaches to greens weren't that great, but sort it out tomorrow and see what happens.   
 Q.  Just to explain, you came in late, and you didn't get much sleep as I understand, so you're probably running on empty?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I landed from Orlando at like one o'clock yesterday afternoon.  Didn't get to the hotel until three.  It's a 13-and-a-half-hour flight and I didn't sleep.  So I had a good sleep last night but still a bit jet-lagged.   
 Q.  The afternoon here, as well, the wind gets up a little bit, doesn't it, so is it tougher to get a good score?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, it was definitely windy the back nine.  I managed to hit some good shots, but yeah, 2-under is okay.   
 Q.  Must be nice playing here this week knowing that it's in the bag already.  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, it's really nice to win the Order of Merit.  That's one of my aims at the start of this year.  It's nice, as well, to get my LPGA Tour card, so it's kind of a relaxing week for me.
