 Q.  You're still very much in the thick of it, aren't you.  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah.   
 Q.  Can you talk us through your round today?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I couldn't really get much going on the front nine.  I was hitting some good shots, but nothing was really happening for me.  Then I made kind of a couple bogeys and I just stayed patient, and then I made some really good putts on 16 and 17, which are really hard holes, so I'm very happy to finish 2-under today.   
 Q.  Would have been nice to have another birdie on 18, wouldn't it?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I left it short.  I thought it was quicker than it was.  But I'll take a par on 18 any day.  I think it's one of the toughest holes on the golf course.  So to have a 7-iron in after my good drive, I was happy with that.   
 Q.  How far were those two putts on 16 and 17?  
GEORGIA HALL: 16 was probably 12, 15 feet, and 17 I was blocked out by a tree a little bit.  I managed to kind of fade it around to hit it to about 25 feet and holed it there.  I'm very happy with that.   
 Q.  It's a bit of a sprint now with only three rounds.  
GEORGIA HALL: I know.   
 Q.  Do you think four shots can be overcome?  
GEORGIA HALL: I think if you -- yeah, if I shoot a really low round, then it can be done.  But I'm going to go out there tomorrow and play my own game, and if I manage to shoot 4- or 5-under, then I think I might have a chance, but I'm in a good position now, and I'm happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  Are you missing your dad on the bag at all?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, it's always nice if family were here and stuff.  He's done a great job on the bag for me recently, and he's had a break.  Brad's been amazing.  We get on really well, so yeah, it's a good week so far.
