 Q.  That was a great win you had today against Cristie Kerr.  You had five birdies on your ball, she had four on hers.  What helped you get through that win?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I mean, I was really excited when I got to know I was going to play her.  When the countries came out, I said, yeah, I've got to get America, I was very happy to.  When I saw it was Cristie, she's an amazing match player and probably like the most experience and she's amazing like mentally it's a battle to play against her.  Yeah, I was really happy with that win.  I played really well.  I think I was 4-under.  She also played great.   
 Q.  You got an early 2-up lead, but she kept clawing back at you.  You didn't really seal it until the finish.  Talk about 17; you hit a great tee shot there to 10 feet, she hits it well inside you to three, great match play golf, and then you bury the putt.  That had to be very satisfying.  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I hit it to about eight foot, and I thought, the job is done then, but she hit it to about three foot, and I said, oh, no.  But I knew she was going to hole it, so I just had to hole my putt, and I was really happy when I saw it go in because I didn't really fancy going down 18.   
 Q.  What do you think the key hole was on the back nine which enabled you to maintain control?  
GEORGIA HALL: I think 14.  She hit a good shot there, went just through the green, and I had about a 100-footer, I think, and I managed to two-putt.  And then 15, I hit it in the water for my second shot, and I pitched it to about two inches to halve the hole.  So I think 14 and 15 were probably the biggest ones.   
 Q.  You had a great performance by Team England this week.  You've got to be very happy collectively.  
GEORGIA HALL: No, we had an amazing week, and I'm very happy.
