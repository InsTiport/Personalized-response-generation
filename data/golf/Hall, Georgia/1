  Q. Awesome, Georgia.  Another steady day at Mission Hills Country Club.  You had a fun playing partner, both of you inside the Top 5 right now.  First off, take us through the day and how you got to a 2-under 70, bogey-free start and then turned into even par on the opening nine?
 GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, I was actually a little bit disappointed.  I got my first bogey of the tournament today on the 13th hole, something like that.  It was a silly three-putt.  But, yeah, I played pretty steady today.  I probably missed a bit more fairways and greens than I did yesterday, but I had some good approaches from some tricky situations so I was pretty pleased with how I played.
 Q. When you have somebody like Anna in your group, does that make you push yourself a little more to keep up?
 GEORGIA HALL:   I mean, me and her were pretty much the same yesterday and today, not much in it.  So, I mean, I played with her quite a lot.  Both from Europe as well and she's a great player and a good friend, so it's always nice and enjoyable to play with her.
 Q. You're a major champ.  Obviously major week at stake here.  First jump into Poppy's Pond, but what can you take from your major experiences in your career to help you this weekend?
 GEORGIA HALL:   I think the extra confidence that I know that I can win a major and I have done.  There is no crowds so be a little bit more quiet, but got a lot of golf left to be played.  Two rounds is a lot, so just focus on tomorrow and rest this afternoon.
 Q. How do you adjust to the heat on a week like this?  Fluid intake?  Stretching?
 GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, just a lot more water than you think, I think, number one.  Today wasn't too bad.  Yesterday was pretty hot.  I think it's going to get pretty hot this afternoon.
 Q. Uh-huh, and the rest of the weekend.
 GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, exactly.
