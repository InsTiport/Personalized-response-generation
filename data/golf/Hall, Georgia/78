Q. Really good last round today.  Are you pleased with your efforts this week?
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, my long game was hopeless, really.  I could have holed a few more this week, but yet again, it was very consistent.  Maybe a bit too consistent.  Not sure where I'll finish but hopefully in the top FIVE if not just outside.
I wanted to keep top five Order of Merit and hopefully I'll finish third.  That will get me in a few majors next year, so I'm really happen.
Q. You're currently tied fifth, so overall this tournament has been pretty good, hasn't it.
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I love the event here.  The golf course is always immaculate.  I played really well this week, so I'm happy to finish on a good week and a very good season.
Q. And what are your plans for the off-season?  What are you going to do now?
GEORGIA HALL: I'm not going to play golf for awhile, maybe three or four weeks, so that will be quite nice, even though I might miss it.  But I don't think I'll play in a tournament for awhile.  I'll try to get back into it in late February, January, keep busy.
Q. Are you happy with the way this year's gone in general?
GEORGIA HALL: Oh, couldn't be happier.  I played so well all year pretty much and I've stayed consistent.  Yeah, I've really been happy and hopefully good things come next year.
