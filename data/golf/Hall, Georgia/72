 Q.  Another great round but not quite enough.  You must be pleased, four great rounds in a major championship of the?  
GEORGIA HALL: I'm very happy really.  Tied third is more than kind of what I expected.  I kind of think 16 and 17 yesterday killed me for the chances of winning it.  But I tried my best today.  The weather was terrible.  There was a lot of rain and stuff, and I had to cope with that, but yeah, I'm happy.   
 Q.  What's the biggest thing that you'll take from this week as a whole going forward?  
GEORGIA HALL: That I can definitely compete with the best.  I played good golf this week.  I think some shots could have been better.  I made a couple of silly mistakes but coming third and still playing well, yeah, that's the main thing.   
 Q.  You've certainly shown that you can compete with the world's best and on the big stage, as well.  How much confidence does that give you?  
GEORGIA HALL: It gives me loads.  Especially with Solheim, as well.  I played with some of the players that will probably be on the team, on the American side, as well.  I'm looking forward to that and looking forward to playing against them.   
 Q.  You mentioned Solheim.  You can think about it now.  It's been at the back of your mind this week?  
GEORGIA HALL: It has.   
 Q.  How important was it to have a big week this week as you build towards that?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, and to show people that I'm in form now, as well, which is a big thing.  Hopefully I can play well for Europe in a couple weeks' time.  I can't wait to get out there.  It will be the highlight of my career.
