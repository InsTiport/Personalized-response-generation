 Q.  How do you rate your week?  
GEORGIA HALL: Very enjoyable.  I played well today.  I just couldn't get a lot going.  There were some tricky pins out there, as well.  Happy to get up-and-down on the last for a bogey.  18 is playing so long.  But you know, I think, I don't know, 12th position maybe.  I'm very happy with the week.  It's my first time here, so another good result.   
 Q.  Another nice cheque?  
GEORGIA HALL: Exactly.  I mean, it wasn't the last round I wanted.  I wanted something like what Anna shot but just wasn't quite there today.  But I've played really well all week and I can't really complain.   
 Q.  Onwards and upwards?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I'm very happy.  To come nearly Top-10 again second major in a row, I'm very happy.  I had a great week.   
 Q.  Do you think the pins were just in tricky positions today or the course was playing long or both?  
GEORGIA HALL: The course was playing long.  It was very cold today so it's playing at least five, seven yards longer, and the spins especially back nine were just really tricky positions.  It's quite hard to get birdies.
