Q. Georgia, back-to-back 67s to start the ShopRite LPGA Classic.  One bogey over 36 holes.  I would imagine that has to leave you in a good position feeling good going into the weekend.
GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, I'm really disappointed an that one bogey.  I wanted to get no bogeys in 36 holes and see how far I can go, but, no, another really consistent day out there and I'm happy my 4-under.
Q. Coming off your most recent, the most recent LPGA Tour champion.  I would imagine a lot of good vibes transferred over the last week off into this event.
GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, obviously I took that confidence from a couple weeks ago and my game is in good shape.  I just stayed really relaxed and really enjoyed it.
So let's see what I can do on the weekend.
Q. How did the course play?  Maybe a little bit differently to yesterday afternoon to today?  Seemed like scores maybe weren't as low this morning as they were for the wave that you were in yesterday afternoon.
GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, yesterday afternoon was pretty windy.  I mean, maybe one or two cup wind, and then, I mean, it's pretty still now, pretty cold this morning as well, colder than I think it was yesterday morning.
So quite soft out there.  Probably one club further I needed than yesterday afternoon.
But, yeah, I think the pins are slightly trickier today.
Q. You've seen the scores over the years here and how you can go pretty low on this course.  Obviously some time to still game plan for the weekend.  What do you anticipate will be your strategy?
GEORGIA HALL:   I think just take the most out of my opportunities, holding a bit more putts.  Yesterday I didn't birdie one par-5.  That was my only negative yesterday.  Going to try to take advantage of them a bit more tomorrow.
