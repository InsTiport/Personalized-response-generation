THE MODERATOR:   We are back with Georgia Hall.  Georgia, it was kind of a tale of two nines for you, three birdies going out, three bogeys coming in, but still you finish at even par.  How was Aronimink treating you today?
GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, I mean, I was really happy with the way I started the round.  It's pretty windy today, maybe two, three-club wind, so it's playing pretty hard.
Yeah, I'm pretty disappointed in my last two holes.  I shouldn't really have bogeyed them.  But I would have taken, I think, level par starting the day, so I've just got to take the positives and get ready for tomorrow.
Q. What are the positives that you pull from today?
GEORGIA HALL:   I actually played really solid.  Didn't make hardly any mistakes.  My driving was pretty good, just kind of the last couple holes let me down.  Try not to have them tomorrow and just go out and kind of practice and work on it.
Q. It's definitely a long course, but how was it playing today?  The way Inbee put it earlier, she thought it was very fair, maybe the easiest we're going to see it this week.
GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, I agree.  I think it was quite fair.  They pushed quite a few of the tees up, and yeah, it probably will be the easiest today, and I think it's a major championship, it should be hard, it should be tough, so looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. Any difference between the front nine and the back nine?  Did the course play differently?
GEORGIA HALL:   I think the wind got up a little bit more on the back nine.  Some of the pins were a little bit tough on the back nine, but also I didn't play as well.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you so much, Georgia.  We'll see you later.
