GEORGIA HALL: I played solid golf all day today.  I was really struggling to make some putts.  Just ended up leaving a couple short in the jaws, which is always really frustrating.  Just kept leaving it short.  But yeah, sometimes it happens.  The greens are tricky and it can be hard to judge the speed sometimes.  Just kept coming up short.  Hopefully tomorrow I can get the speed of the greens and kind of capitalize on what I had yesterday going where I can lowly some longer-distance putts again.   
 Q.  On the front nine, there wasn't much happening for you, and then on the back nine, that birdie at 11, talk us through that celebration.  What was all that about?  
GEORGIA HALL: I mean, I created some really good chances on the front nine, and just wasn't getting any luck.  Couldn't make any putts.  Finally, you know, a putt drops, so it was kind of like relief, thinking I can build on this.  But yeah, it was just, you know, kind of finally relief.   
 Q.  Looks like you'll probably be around four shots behind starting tomorrow.  What's the mind-set for tomorrow?  What's the approach?  
GEORGIA HALL: Go and make as many birdies as possible.  I'm hitting the ball well.  Creating chances.  So there's no reason why I can't go out and shoot a really low number:
