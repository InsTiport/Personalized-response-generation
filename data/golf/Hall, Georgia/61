 Q.  Pretty difficult circumstances certainly for you?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I played really well my back nine.  I holed some good putts.  Front nine, just nothing was going in.  It's quite frustrating for me, but I kind of stayed patient and managed to shoot a good score.   
 Q.  When I say difficult circumstances, that's because we were talking yesterday about you not getting much sleep on the way here, and last night, what was it, two hours?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, I got two hours.  Woke up at like midnight and didn't get back to sleep.  I wasn't in the best of moods today.  I'm quite tired.  But I played well, so maybe I should do that more often.   
 Q.  And a great putt to finish?  
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah, it was a long putt, maybe like 30 feet.  I did putt well today, and I wanted to take advantage of the morning round because the greens were in better condition and less wind, so I'm glad I did.   
 Q.  What's the phrase, beware the injured golfer, or tired golfer?  
GEORGIA HALL: I would have taken half a club more.  I was so tired, I thought, I'll wake up at five.  But I think I wake up at eleven.
