Q.   You've just won a 45,000 pound car with a hole‑in‑one here.   Obvious question, but how does that feel? 
GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, really good.   I wasn't playing that great before.   I did hit some really good shots, though, and I hit 4‑iron, I think it was 167 yards.   It was a perfect shot.   I couldn't really see it because the sun was in my eyes but it was a great feeling.

Q.   Did you know it was in halfway through the shot?
GEORGIA HALL:   It was straight online, so I hoped it was going to roll in, and it did, so I'm happy.

Q.   Can you drive? 
GEORGIA HALL:   No.   (Laughing).   So I'm not sure what I'm going to do.   But it's a great experience, as well. 

Q.   You can learn to drive?
GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, definitely now, if I can drive that, that would be cool. 

Q.   Mercedes for your first car, not a bad way to get your career underway on the Ladies European Tour?
GEORGIA HALL:   Oh, yeah, it's very good.   I can't wait for next year, as well. 

Q.   How many have you had? 
GEORGIA HALL:   That's my second.

Q.   Where was the first one? 
GEORGIA HALL:   British ladies final.
