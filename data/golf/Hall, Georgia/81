 Q.  Georgia, great finish to the year.  You must be very pleased.  
GEORGIA HALL: Didn't end up how I wanted the last few holes.  Started really well but to finish the year in I think the hardest LET event of the year because there's bigger players playing here, so I think I've come maybe like 13th.  So I am happy with that really deep down.   
I tried my best today but the wind got up a bit, misjudged it a couple times.  I'm happy the way I played.   
 Q.  What about the year as a whole, are you happy with it?  
GEORGIA HALL: Second half, happier, yeah.  I haven't missed a cut at all on the LET, so that's good -- that's not my aim, but it's good for my rookie year.  I've done a lot better the second half, so I think next year is going to be a big year for me.   
 Q.  What are you going to work on for next year?  What are your goals?  
GEORGIA HALL: A lot mentally.  Just keep focused and taking one shot at a time.  Sometimes I'm a bit impatient and get ahead of myself.  Keep working on short game if I can.   
 Q.  What are your plans after this?  
GEORGIA HALL: I think I'm going to take like two weeks and not touch a golf club around Christmas, that sounds good.  I haven't done that in years.  And then I'm back at it for a month in Australia start of February.  I think start the year fresh, so that's good.
