Q. So this is your first event back after winning a major.
GEORGIA HALL: Yeah.
Q. What was it like being out there?
GEORGIA HALL: It was cool.  I mean, it was so nice to get so much congratulations from the players.  So many people coming up to me, and it just like made my feel really liked, if you know what I mean.  People I haven't really spoke to before said, Well done.
Yeah, it's really nice to be back and really nice to be playing good.  I'm a little bit tired and a little bit -- I've got a cold or something, yeah.
You know, yeah, I had fun out there.  Played quite well, so I was happy.
Q. What did you do during the time off?
GEORGIA HALL: I had only five days at home so not a lot.  I didn't hit a golf ball.  And I saw some family and went to lunch and dinner, so it was nice.
Q. How has your life change since then, if any?
GEORGIA HALL: It's changed in the sense that I'm British Open champion and a lot more people know me, like it would for anyone.
I think as a person I'm still the same, and I think I'll remain the same even if I win ten more.  That's the main thing for me.
But I'm very happy.
