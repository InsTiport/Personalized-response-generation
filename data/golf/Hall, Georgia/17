  Q. Can you talk about your round and the eagle?
 GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, I played pretty solid.  It was probably my best long game performance of the week so far, so that gave me a bit of confidence.
 Yeah, 13 is probably the hardest hole on the course.  It's quite a scary tee shot, so they moved the tee up, I think it's 240 yards to the front, so I tried to commit to my drive and be braver on it.  I hit it to ten foot and holed the putt, so I was extremely happy to get 2 on that hole.
 Q. Third round, you've gotten better each day, are you feeling better as you go into next week?
 GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, I think this is my first proper event back after four or five months, so I'm happy the way I've come into the event and handled the nerves and calmness of myself.  I'm really looking forward to tomorrow and obviously it gives me confidence for next week.
 Q. Did you feel really nervous coming in just because of the big break?
 GEORGIA HALL:   Actually wasn't as bad as I thought.  I actually wasn't that nervous as all, because I know I prepared as well as I could, and I love playing in Scotland and these courses.  Yeah, I was just very excited to play again.
 Q. And how have you found the whole week with the restrictions?
 GEORGIA HALL:   I've felt very safe.  I think sometimes it's tricky that you can't really leave your hotel room, but at least we're out playing golf, so that's the main thing.  And hopefully my following weeks, I've got quite a long run now, it will be fine.
 Q. Can you talk about how the course setup is different from last year?
 GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, they have grown the rough up quite a lot and made a couple holes longer and also the pin positions are a lot harder in the first three days than they were last year.  So I think that's why scoring is a lot higher than normal, but mostly because I think they have made it a bit longer going into the par 4s.
 Q. And are you liking that?
 GEORGIA HALL:   I think it's a great setup.  I think the pins are on some funny slopes sometimes, a bit tricky, but that's part of links golf, I suppose.
 Q. Did you play any links golf coming into this week?
 GEORGIA HALL:   No, only Royal St. George's in the Rose Series, but that's only one day.  Apart from that, I don't live near any links golf courses, so no prep for links, really.  But I love it even more every time I come back.  I love how you have to be creative and play against the wind.  It's a lot of fun.
