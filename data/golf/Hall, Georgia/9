Q. You look like you're in a little bit of shock right now.  Is that the case?
GEORGIA HALL:   I'm just so happy.  You know, I was pretty nervous the last nine holes and I never looked at the leaderboard once, so I had no idea where I was.  I didn't know I was leading.  Must have been leading for that four or five holes.
So I'm pretty glad I did look.  Yeah, to bogey the last I was quite upset about that.  I had to refigure myself and get back to try and win that playoff.
Q. Not knowing where you stand, was that part of what you try to do?
GEORGIA HALL:   If there is no leaderboards everywhere I think it's better off not to.  Normally they're right in our face and you can't get away from it.
I know I was playing pretty well, so just kind of tried to stay patient.
Q. How much did it test your patience out there today with the scores being so good for a three-day event?
GEORGIA HALL:   Well, the pins are so tricky today.  I knew the scoring wouldn't be a low.  I had a really good run in the middle there, three or four in a row; had to hold on the last few holes.
Q. (Indiscernible)  how was your mentality?
GEORGIA HALL:   Yeah, I just kind of focused on my own shots and didn't try and look what Ash was doing.  She's a phenomenal player.  Even to shoot 7-under today to get in a playoff was great going, so all credit to her.
Yeah, I just had to try and keep holing my putts.  I never knew if she was going to miss that, so I just tried to hole it.
Q. Last one.  Many Japanese people watching back home.  Could you give them a message?
GEORGIA HALL:   Thank you for all watching.  I'm happy I have fans in Japan.  I love the country and I love the food.
