Q. How do you feel through two days here?  Impressions of your game and the course out there?
GEORGIA HALL: The course is really good.  I mean, it's really soft today which made things a little bit longer because of the rain this morning.  Warmups got a bit stop and start.
My long game was really good today.  Just couldn't really hole that many putts so that was a little bit like frustrating.  But holed some good ones as well, so I'm still happy.
Q. Have you felt different this week playing in a major as major champion already?
GEORGIA HALL: Just a bit more confidence.  So apart from that, I still feel the same.
Q. Anything you've worked on in your game that you think is working this week?
GEORGIA HALL: I've worked quite a bit on my putting and chipping.  I chipped well today.  I didn't really miss that many greens.  Yeah, I holed some good putts today, some like long ones.
I missed a couple for birdie, so now it's just like practice a bit on my putting.
Q. What did you think is the most important thing you need to do here on this course?
GEORGIA HALL: Putt well, and especially put the ball on the right side of the pin, right kind of part of the greens.  Very important.
Q. What do you think it's going to take to win this week?  Any numbers in mind?
GEORGIA HALL: No.  I mean, I don't really think in numbers.  I think as long as I'm -- obviously I want to be like leading, but as long as I'm kind of near up there on the final day, then I think 18 holes is a lot of golf.
And you've got to be quite straight on this golf course.  You've got to have everything kind of going good for you on this golf course because it's quite tight as well.  You've got to hit fairways.  If you don't hit fairways, some shots you can't get to the green.
