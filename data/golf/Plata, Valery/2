Q. So you're on to the quarterfinals in the US Women's Amateur.  You've been in the quarterfinals of the girls junior before.  How does it feel to be advancing this far?
VALERY PLATA:   It feels great.  I didn't really come with a lot of expectations for this week, and I've been playing really good.  I've been putting really well, and the greens, just happy to be here.
Q. You got off to an early lead, winning the first three holes.  Talk me through that stretch.
VALERY PLATA:   First, I pretty much just hit my approach shots into the green and Ty, didn't really hit it.  She was kind of like looking to do an up-and-down on the first three holes -- well, she missed a short one there, too, but 1 and 3, just had to make an up-and-down and she just conceded the putt.
Q. What did that do for your confidence, knowing you've had that cushion and that lead?
VALERY PLATA:   Yeah, I knew I was off to a great start and I just tried to keep it up, not just be like, okay, I'm up, I'm just going to relax.  No, I just tried to go as low as possible and just try to win as fast as possible, too.
Q. Were there any key holes on the back nine or through the middle of the round?
VALERY PLATA:   Yeah, I think No. 9, I kind of had to make a long putt for par to tie the holes.  I think that was key.
And 11, my approach shot, I had the ball in a divot.  Didn't hit it very well from there, but then made a good up-and-down, and so I think those two were really key.
On 13, I hit a good shot again, yeah.
Q. What's the mind-set going into tomorrow?
VALERY PLATA:   I think I just have to keep doing what I'm doing, and enjoy, enjoy the process and just go shot by shot and just hole-by-hole.
