  Q. I think you're one of a few players that are under par as of right now.  Tell me a little bit about how the course was playing and how you were able to score well both these days.
 VALERY PLATA:   Yeah, the course today was playing a little bit more wet than yesterday because of the rain the first day, but I just kind of did the same thing.  I tried to keep the ball in the fairway and place it right on the greens and just try and make as many putts as I could.
 Q. You've had experience in USGA championships before; how do you think some of that experience is going to play into match play against some of these other golfers here?
 VALERY PLATA:   Yeah, I think it's great.  I love to come to these tournaments, and I always have a lot of fun.  I really enjoy playing match play.  It's not like a usual format I play in college or anything else, so I really enjoy it.  It's going to be a lot of fun.
 Q. Does it feel like a different year, a different tournament with everything going on, or when you're out there does it feel like normal?
 VALERY PLATA:   I thought it was going to feel more different.  This is like my first tournament after the COVID breakouts and stuff, so I thought it was going to feel different, but it's not.  I feel like I was playing well back in March and I'm still playing well, so pretty much the same.
 Q. What's been your favorite part of the week so far?
 VALERY PLATA:   Honestly, I'm having a lot of fun, the golf course and my caddie, he's just an old friend of mine.  We're having a blast out there, and it's been fun.
