Q. You came up short but had an outstanding week.  How would you evaluate your week here and the progress you made?
VALERY PLATA:   I think it was really good.  Actually it was great.  I had a lot of fun.  Kind of played good the whole way through and was very consistent, so I'm really happy about it.
Q. What does making this semifinal round here in the Women's Am do for your confidence the next few tournaments you're playing and hopefully the college season this fall?
VALERY PLATA:   Yeah, it means a lot.  I mean, playing with the players I played in match play is just really good.  I haven't really been this far in any USGA event, and these are always like the events that have the best players in the world.  I'm really happy and happy to know that I'm one of those, too.
Q. What would you say were a few of your favorite shots that you hit or your favorite moments from the week?
VALERY PLATA:   Yeah, I hit some really good shots into 17, stroke play and match play.  On 6, too.  I made this morning a chip from just short of the hole on 9 --
Q. I saw that, yeah, that was a big chip to tie the match.
VALERY PLATA:   Yep, and then I made some good putts all week long.  So yeah.
