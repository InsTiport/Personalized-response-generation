Q. You seem to do well in these dunhill events?

DOUG McGUIGAN:  That's right! I was second in South Africa back in January after losing the play off, but it's fair to say that I like these events - maybe I should get dunhill to sponsor me!
It was great fun out there and I had the perfect partner today - I think Frank [Keener] shot something like an unofficial 69. On the three holes that he was stroking he had a birdie and two eagles which was brilliant. 

I love coming here as well. My father is Scottish, but I was born in South Africa and live in Canada. so although I don't get to come here that often, it's always special for me to play in Scotland because I get to see some of my family from here, as well.
