 Q.  DJ, weather a huge factor.  A lot colder out there this week.  How about your game though?  How would you assess it?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was just okay.  I felt like I hung in there pretty well, but I hit a lot of good shots.  Just struggled on the greens this week.  I felt like I couldn't make any putts.  I felt like I was hitting good putts.  Whether I was misreading them or what, I just felt like I struggled on the greens a bit.   
 Q.  It's a little different, the speed is so much slower here than what you've become accustomed to the last few weeks.  Oakmont (Inaudible).  How will you adjust?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'll be fine.  The faster the greens, the better.  I like fast greens, but I like the greens over here.  I don't know, I guess they're so flat here I just struggled to get a good read on them.   
 Q.  What do you make of what Phil and Henrik are doing out there?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: They're playing good golf.  I felt like if I would have played well, it's where I would have been.  But I just struggled a little bit.  But they're obviously playing very good golf.   
 Q.  Looking forward to next week at all?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm looking forward to getting back to some warm weather, playing on some fast greens.  It will be nice.   
 Q.  What do you like about Glen Abbey?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I played well there last time I played, so I think it's a golf course where if I drive it well, I'm going to play pretty well there.
