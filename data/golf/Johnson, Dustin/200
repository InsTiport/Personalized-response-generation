 Q.  Except for a couple of holes there, you played a really solid round of golf.  Your thoughts on how you played today.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I played good again today.  Just, you know, two bad drives around 4 and 5, but other than that I drove it well all day.  Hit a lot of great iron shots.  Had a lot of good looks at birdie and even hit a lot of good putts.  Just didn't go in the hole but yeah, I feel like I'm rolling the ball really well.  I'm hitting my irons really good.  I'm driving it good.  I made the two bogeys just from -- got out of position off the tee.   
But other than that, I felt like it was a really solid day and you know, obviously could have been a little bit better.  But you know, it was good.  This golf course, it's not very easy.  You've got to drive it straight and then you've got to hit really good iron shots if you want to have any kind of look at birdie.   
 Q.  How penal is the rough?  I know those two wayward tee shots where you made bogey, those were almost impossible.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, the rough's bad.  You hit it in the rough, especially on the longer holes, you know, it's tough to get it up out of the green.   
But you know, I made actually two good bogeys on both of those holes because I hit terrible shots out of the rough.  But other than that, it was a good, solid day.  I got off to a good are the is it a.  Hit a lot of great shots and I really hit a lot of good shots late.  I'm really pleased with the way the golf game is right now and I'm looking forward to this weekend.   
 Q.  And comfortable even more with the TaylorMade putter you're using now?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm using just an Anser-style TaylorMade putter.  It's just like the putter I used to putt with.  Yeah, I'm very comfortable with it.  Feel like I'm rolling it really well.
