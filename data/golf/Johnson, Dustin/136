 Q.  Dustin, congratulations.  1th tour win at the RBC Canadian Open.  How much does this win mean this week particularly after the missed cut last week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, even after the missed cut last week, I felt like I was hitting it fine.  I just did not score very well at Carnoustie at all.  I didn't putt good.  I just scored really badly.  But I hit the ball -- I felt like I hit the ball plenty good enough to be under par after two days, and I was 5-over or something.  It was just bad scoring.   
So I worked on it a little bit this week.  I felt like even coming in here, I felt like I was swinging it well, doing everything really well.  I needed to work on the putter though, which I did.  Started rolling the putter a lot better here this week.  You know, really, really hit the ball well all four days.   
 Q.  Yeah, I thought your ball striking tee to green was good.  The putting was good.  You worked on that.  Obviously Paulina has ties to Canada.  I mean, you win the RBC Canadian Open, you're an RBC ambassador, it's got to mean something pretty special?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it definitely means a lot.  Signing with RBC this year, and coming up here to the RBC Canadian Open and winning, especially on a golf course where I've had success, it means a lot.  Obviously having a lot of ties to Canada with Paulina, her dad, Wayne, who, thanks to him, I get a lot of fans out here, so it makes it a lot more fun playing out here in front of a big crowd.  I had a lot of support this week, and it was a lot of fun.   
 Q.  You get the third win of the season, you pad the FedExCup points.  Congratulations, see you next week.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Thank you.
