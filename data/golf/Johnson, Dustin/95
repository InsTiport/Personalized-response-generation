Q. Do you think your score reflects the way you played today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I don't think so.  I played a little bit better than my score.  But first time being here in a while, not real used to the golf course.  I felt like I hit the ball really well, even hit good putts, just a couple misreads, but all in all it was a good score and I felt like the conditions were, they were tricky.  Wind was blowing pretty good and it was tough to get a bead on with whether it was hurting or helping because there was a lot of cross winds on every hole.  But I'm pleased with the round.
Q. Is that the first time you saw the back nine since 2010?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  For sure.
Q. What did you hit on 14 and what did you have?  That's the par-5.  Water, flowers back there.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit driver and a 3-wood.
Q. How far did you have?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: 250 front.  Straight into the wind, from what I could tell.
Q. Is it encouraging that you didn't play as well as you could have and still scored?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I mean I played well, I just didn't score as good as I could have.  I just missed a couple short ones, but it wasn't bad putts, which is a good thing, it was just a misread of a couple putts.  But, yeah, I mean it's definitely, I feel like the game's been good for a while and hopefully continues to stay good, I feel like I'm swinging really well, and I did everything really well today, just need to get it in the hole a little bit quicker.
