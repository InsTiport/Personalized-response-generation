 Q.  (Inaudible).  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought it was pretty good other than No. 11.  I played pretty well.  And I even hit a good shot off the tee on 11.  Just the winds in off the left.  I hit a cut and it was cutting and all of a sudden it stopped and it went just in the gorse and ended up making 7.  But other than that I played pretty well.   
 Q.  The front nine was basically (Inaudible).  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, because I felt like I hit a good tee shot and I don't know why the wind didn't take it more to the right.  But you know it happens, I guess.  It's a tough tee ball.  But, yeah, it was definitely frustrating because I was off to a really good start and 3-under through 10.  Ended up shooting 1-over today.   
 Q.  How do you see things now looking ahead to tomorrow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, just need to go out and shoot a good score, see what happens.   
 Q.  (Inaudible) how did you feel about it?  Did it matter?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't think it matters how well you putt that hole, it's still tough.  But I hit a good shot in there 15 feet just past it, so I was excited.   
 Q.  Overall are you enjoying your week here?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I am.  Today was definitely very difficult conditions out there.  Even the front nine right, it was blowing hard off the right, little bit of help.  Then the back nine was a lot in and off the left.  So they played very difficult.   
 Q.  Is this one of the more difficult courses you play?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know.  I mean, yeah, the weather makes it very difficult when you make the turn, for sure.   
 Q.  Do you look at the leaderboard and see it as a challenge?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I knew I needed to shoot under par to get myself in the mix for tomorrow.  But it is what it is.  Maybe go out and who knows, shoot a really good score tomorrow.
