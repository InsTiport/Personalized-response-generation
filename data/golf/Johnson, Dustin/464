Q.   Yesterday you came from 3â€‘down to win it on the 20th.   Totally different today.   What was the difference today? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yesterday I just wasn't feeling all that great starting out.   So I just kind of hung in there all day.   And got a little momentum late, hit some good shots.   And obviously holed a few chips.   But that kept my momentum going.   And I was fortunate enough to win on the 20th hole yesterday. 
And that momentum kind of carried over to today.   Got off to a good start and just played really solidly today.

Q.   Your chipping was good today, again.   Are you working on your short game?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I've been working on chipping and putting a little bit.   But I've still got to get the wedges a little bit better.   But I'm striking the ball pretty well.   Drove in the fairway today, hit some good iron shots.   I've got to keep doing that.

Q.   The previous three years you hadn't won a match.   You've won two now.   Do you feel the momentum building?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I was standing on the range this morning, like, it's kind of nice to see the range on Thursday.   I haven't done that yet. 
It was a good day today.   And hopefully I can have another one tomorrow.

Q.   Looks like it might be Mark Wilson.   What sort of opponent do you think he'll be?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I think last year I lost to him on the 19th hole.   He's a great match play player.   He's a good all around player.   It will be a tough match.
