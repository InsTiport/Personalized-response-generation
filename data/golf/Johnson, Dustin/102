 Q.  What was the key to that round today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I felt like I played pretty solid all day.  Obviously a little frustrated with the 6 on 9, but other than that, all in all, it was a really good day.  I felt like I gave myself a lot of chances.  I rolled it pretty good.  I didn't really make any putts.  But just played really solid.   
 Q.  How do you notice the difference in the way it played today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel like the course plays much better now.  The only way I had played it was in May, and now I just feel like it's more -- I don't know, if you hit a good shot, it ends up close to the hole.  When before, you could hit really good shots it would end up in terrible spots, now I feel like if you hit a good shot, it's close, and you get rewarded for good shots.
