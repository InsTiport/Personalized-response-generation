Q. How satisfied are you with your round today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, very pleased with it. 4â€‘under is a good score around here any day. And first round that's all you kind of want is just to get off to a good start. I felt I drove it well, hit a lot of good iron shots, put the ball where I wanted to on the greens and made some nice putts. I'm very pleased with how I played.

Q. After a couple of days of rain and the course drying out today, what did you think of the course conditions?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought the course conditions were great. The wind picked up this afternoon and made it a little bit tricky. But other than that the course is in fantastic condition, I felt they did a great job with the way they got the course ready.

Q. I was talking to a couple of guys earlier, some of the greens with the pin placement was more difficult, how did you feel?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, they had some new pins out today, some tricky pins. Yeah, it was tough. A lot of pins, which is no different than any other day out here. You've got some pins you can get it close to and then you've got some pins where it's impossible to get close to it unless you've hit a bad shot. But, yeah, I mean I felt like the setup was great. Felt like it played pretty difficult.

Q. There's a crowded leaderboard at the top. There were over 20 guys within four shots of the lead. What do you think that says about the course conditions today or even the tournament?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel like after Day 1 that's generally how it always is. There's some good scores. And I felt like it played tough. You have guys that are always going to shoot some good scores around here.
