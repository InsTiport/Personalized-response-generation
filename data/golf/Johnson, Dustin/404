 Q.   What was it like being on the golf course today compared to yesterday?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Goes back to a pretty normal wind. I thought it played a little tougher yesterday.   But today the golf course played great, it's in great shape and played a little better.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday was the Kona winds, so 18 was into the breeze and everybody was laying up, today you're in the middle of the fairway here and you hit the green and first player to do so all week.   What did you see from there?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I hit two really good shots.   I hit a really good drive down there and I really hit a nice 3‑wood.   It's still playing kind of right‑to‑left, maybe a little bit of hurt.   
   
 Q.   Last year we talked about you have the ability to overpower a golf course and overpower a field sometimes when you had the victory at Kapalua.   Do you get the feeling that you can do that over the next couple of days?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, this golf course sets up well for me.   I can reach all the par5s and there's a few short holes where you can drive it up close to the green.   So if I chip it and putt it well, I'm going to shoot a good score pretty much every time.   
   
 Q.   Good iron striking day for you, you only missed two greens on the day and you found nine birdies out on the golf course.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I hit the ball well.   I hit the ball well today.   Played a lot better than I did yesterday.   Made a couple putts, hit some better pitch shots.   Yesterday I missed three out of the first four greens.   I hit a good shot on two, went just over the back but three and four, I had 80 yards or something and missed the green.   It was just pathetic.   But today I played a lot better and I hit the ball really well.  
   
 Q.   Is some of that due to the winds?   These are not quite the tradewinds but certainly more familiar winds than what we saw in the opening round?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I'm definitely more comfortable in these winds.   But yesterday the shots I had weren't tough.   It was just poor execution.   Today was good, I just have to keep it up and made two bogeys which were bad, just missed a couple short putts, but other than that, I played good all day.  
   
 Q.   First player in the field to hit 18 in two, we had you 353 off the tee, 305 to the stick.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I hit a good drive to get it down there.   Still kind of hurting a little bit off the tee, pretty much dead right‑to‑left and a little bit of hurt and the second shot I hit a really solid 3‑wood to get there.  
   
 Q.   For the two measured drives in the second round, 323 and a half yards and all 15 drives, 301‑yard average and the 12th hole you hit it 379 yards.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I hit it pretty going off 12.   It was a little kind of down breeze off the right.   
   
 Q.   I'm glad you could hit it 379 and tell me you could catch all of it.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Thanks.   I played a lot better today, just two bogeys.   I missed a short putt on 11 and then 13, I hit just a really bad iron shot to the right side of the green and 3‑putted.   Other than that, I played really good all day.   
   
 Q.   And your neck is fine?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it's fine.   It's not affecting me at all.   It's going away.   I just tweaked a muscle a little bit, so resting and it's good to go.   It was a little sore but it's not anymore.   It's fine.   
   
 Q.   Did you take like a muscle relax error something?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, anti‑inflammatory, muscle relaxer and it's helped.   I rested all day Wednesday and Thursday.
