  DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I thought I did pretty well.   I doubled the first, which is easy to do.   But played really solid after that.  
   
 Q.   Did the high numbers on the board, was it mental or did you just hit a bad shot?   Is it easy to lose your concentration in this heat?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   You can't hit them good.   The bad ones seemed okay, but here if they're not spot on, then they look like they're bad shots, even though you might have just barely pushed it a yard or two.   
I thought I played really well today.   I thought I rolled it pretty well.   Had a few putts that lipped out.   I don't think I hit any bad putts, going down the lines, had a good look.  
Other than that hit some good shots.  
   
 Q.   That birdie on 10, boy, that had to have been your biggest shot?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   That was definitely.   I hit a great shot in there, landed a foot from the hole, then rolled over the back.   But I think it was going a little fast and then it went in.   
   
 Q.   You call that the putt of the day?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, for me, for sure.   
   
 Q.   Had a rough start, looked like you mis‑hit an iron in the fairway and a chunk chip, three‑putt?   Did you have a bad breakfast?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   On 3, I‑‑ 2, I‑‑ I hit a chip shot, hit a good putt.  
   
 Q.   The three‑putt, of course, that followed?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, still then I didn't hit a bad putt.   I left the first a little short, and the second I hit the lip.   I hit the putts where I wanted to.   
   
 Q.   And then 4 you were short, and looked like you were misclubbed there?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I almost wiffed it on four tee.   And then it was plugged in the face of the bunker.   
   
 Q.   Did you have a bad breakfast or anything?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No.   I hit a perfect drive on 1.   2 I hit a good shot.   
   
 Q.   What are you telling yourself to keep yourself‑‑  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I've got a lot of golf thoughts.   I'd rather be 2‑over through 4 than 2‑over through 15.   
And it wasn't like I did anything wrong or made a mistake or anything, just didn't execute.   I felt like I'm playing well.   I knew from 5 in, that I played 4‑under, that's pretty solid.   I'm not disappointed with that.   I missed quite a few short putts for birdie.   Hit good putts, just didn't go in.   
   
 Q.   How important do you think those birdies on 5 and 6 were?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Those were really important, for sure.   Especially with 5 a difficult hole, having a great drive down there.   And hit a good shot, there.   And then a good shot on 6.  
   
 Q.   Just to get the momentum turned around.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yes, and then 7, hit it in the middle of the green, and three‑putt.
