 Q. How do you find the course today versus yesterday?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: The golf course is in great shape. The greens were rolling really well, and playing in the morning it kind of helps with that. 
 But the greens were rolling great all day. It was a little easier to get putts in the hole and the golf course is set up really fair.

 Q. Do you see a big difference between the way it's playing now versus the way it plays when you play it in February?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: There's a lot of difference. 

 Q. Point some of those out. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You hit driver a lot more in February. The ball doesn't roll at all. So then coming into greens every club you hit spins back. So it's a lot different with the ball bouncing a lot. 

 Q. Does it feel weird not having to pack an umbrella and stuff to come out to this course?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's kind of nice not wearing rain gear. In February we wear rain gear the whole time. But it's nice. 

 Q. A lot of guys have said this plays so differently from the AT&T, guys who might do well in that setup, not so well in a faster setup like this. How have you been able to adjust, it's really a different course in a lot of ways this time of year. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's a lot different. But it's still the same golf course. You just got to pick out your spots where you want to land it. It's the same as the AT&T. The ball's coming backwards then instead of going forward. So you still have to have good spots to land the ball, and you got to have good lines off the tee.

 Q. Your two wins here make you very comfortable?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Whenever you have success at a golf course you get a lot of confidence. So I've got a lot of confidence at this golf course, and it sets up very well for me. 

 Q. Knowing your playing in a morning round you sort of think you've a legitimate shot of making a move because the course isn't chewed up, it hasn't had any impact. What approach do you have when you start the day as opposed to following a significant portion of the field?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, playing in the morning it's not going to be as windy, and, you know, the greens are going to roll very well. So you know you got to maybe be aggressive in the morning and try to get some birdies. 

 Q. What's this been like hearing this kind of reception for Watson and what's probably his last?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's great. He's playing very well too, I think I saw. For him to be out here and competing, it's just awesome. 

 Q. What is it about this course that just seems to suit you so well that you just figure it out better than others do?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm very comfortable off the tee here. So I drive it pretty well, and in these greens, they're really small. But if you're hitting good quality shots, you can get it close to the hole. And I just feel like I got a good game plan to play this golf course. 

 Q. Did you talk to Mark O'Meara much, he was the prince of Pebble Beach. He won here six times. They're saying you might be the new prince of Pebble Beach?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I haven't talked to him very much. 

 Q. Coming into this weekend, do you like the weather, would you prefer a change in it, and in general, what will you need to keep your forward momentum?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: The weather's great. The weather, you don't need a change in the weather, but I just got to keep doing what I'm doing. I'm hitting the ball. I'm driving it well. I'm hitting some good shots into the green. I just need to get a few more putts to go into the hole.

 Q. The caddie says he's feeling the same kind of vibe that he had the last couple years in February here. Do you feel that too? I know you're halfway there, but do you feel something?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm just staying very patient. This golf course it takes a lot of patience. You're going to make some bogeys, but if you hit some good shots you got a lot of chances of making some birdies. 
 So as long as I stay patient and just keep driving it and hitting it like I am I'm going to be around this weekend. 

 Q. Are you asking for help on putts much?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I tend to read these greens pretty well. So I like to read them by myself most of the time. I'll ask him every once in awhile just to see if I'm a little bit confused.

 Q. You played it enough where the tugs are and everything else?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.

 Q. How often did you use your driver today?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit 2, 3 -- let's see, probably six times. Seven times. So I hit it a good bit. 

 Q. Similar game plan to the AT&T, or do you have a little more conservative plan since it's a U.S. Open?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's a little more conservative. You can't hit a lot of drivers just because the way the ball's rolling out. But I hit seven today, which is a good bit and -- but I hit a lot of 3-irons too. 

 Q. When you talk about the familiarity of this place, is your routine familiar too, are you staying in the same place, going to the same places things like that?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, well, I actually -- I stayed at the lodge this week, so I switch, I usually stay with a friend that lives over on the MPCC, but I just stayed here this week. I just figured it will be a little easier.

 Q. You don't have a lucky restaurant that you got to eat at every time you come here?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No. Wherever I can get to quick. 

 Q. What's some of the stuff that you and Butch worked on, and how has it helped you this week?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: The biggest thing we were working on cutting it. I hit a lot of cut shots this week. And I'm hitting them very well. So it's definitely helped out. 

 Q. Easier to kind of control the ball around here with that?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, and get it to stop. Trying to hold it against the wind or, you know, a high cut usually stops a little quicker than a draw.

 Q. Is that now your stock shot or something you can go to when you need it?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, just when I want to hit it.
