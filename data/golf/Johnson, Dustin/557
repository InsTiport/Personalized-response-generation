 Q. 5-under 66, great playing, finished at 15-under. Tell me about your round. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, I got off to a pretty good start, hit good shots on 1, hit it close on 2 for eagle, just missed and made birdie. Then birdied 3. So I got off to a good start. I played well, drove it straight today, which is a big key for me. And I hit a lot of good shots, just couldn't get the ball in the hole. 

 Q. Tell me about that putt on 18. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Oh, you know, me and Bobby both read it dead straight. We thought it might sneak a little left in the beginning but then it had to go back right at the hole. I hit it pretty hard, and it just went left hard and hit the left edge. 

 Q. Maybe you'll get in a playoff, we'll have to wait and see. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, we'll see. I know Jason is pretty close for eagle, so we'll have to wait and see. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I knew I had to make it. You know, I thought I had a good read on it, played it straight. It just went left. They said Angel had the same putt, too, and it just doesn't look like it's going left. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it had nothing to do with -- I could see the line, and I hit it right where I wanted to, just missed it. 

 Q. Overall are you happy with the way you played?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm happy with the way I played. I hit a lot of good putts today that just burned the edges. Played solid overall, drove it straight, which for me that's my key, to drive it straight.

 Q. Why do you think Fred Couples should pick you for The Presidents Cup team?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think I'm a good asset to the team, and I'm a very good competitor and I like to win. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm happy. I mean, I did everything I could to shoot a good score and just fell a little short.
