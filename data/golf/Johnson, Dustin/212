Q. You were talking about putting today, and I guess if you had to pick one thing, was that it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, the same thing as yesterday.  I hit the ball better than I did yesterday.  That's for sure.  Drove it very well, you know, hit a lot of good iron shots, just didn't make any putts.
I birdied the first two holes, but those were tap-ins.  You know, I missed another one on 4 from about three feet.  Again, I didn't feel like I was hitting bad putts, it just, I don't know, misreading them, something.  I don't know what else it was.
Q. Were you a little surprised?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I felt like -- you know, this is a golf course, that I really like this golf course.  It sets up really well for me, especially if I'm driving it like I did today.  I couldn't have shot any higher.  I couldn't possibly shoot any higher than I did.  I just struggled on the greens.  It's simple.
Q. The first time the top 3 three players in a row all missed the cut (Inaudible)?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, because if you look at the golf course and you even talk to me, Jason or Rory, this course sets up perfect for us.  But as we all know, this game's all about putting.  So it's pretty simple, I just didn't get it in the hole fast enough.
Q. Do you not let that bother you too much?  Is that just what happens sometimes?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's just golf.  It's frustrating.  But I don't let it bother me.  I feel like the golf game is there.  I feel like I'm playing good.  You know, I've got four weeks off now.  I'm looking forward to it very much.  I'll work on the game a little bit, and I'll be ready to play at the British.
Q. Coming in here you felt your putting was in pretty good shape.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I didn't feel like I was putting badly.  I felt like I was stroking it pretty good, just wasn't going in the hole.
Q. On 13, is that -- I don't know that you've ever lost any faith, but you three-putted there.  What was that?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I was fine.  First putt I just didn't hit quite hard enough, a little left, a little bit short.  The next putt I'm playing right center and it breaks to the right.  So, you know, what do you do?  I never saw it going to the right and it went to the right.  Maybe I need to go get glasses.  I don't know.
Q. Did you at least see the ball on 18 when you hit the 300-yard shot?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, no one's going to make a three there.  But I gave it a good try, that's for sure.  Yeah, my ball just got -- obviously, I'm hitting a 3-wood pretty much as hard as I can from that distance.  I hit it really good, just the wind took it.  I was trying to hit it just right of the flag, and it took it right at the flag.  It's tough to get a wedge to stop on that shot much less a 3-wood.
Q. A month off.  How long will you put away the sticks?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Probably not too long.  I need to practice a little bit.  I need to work on my putting mostly.  But I'll play a lot.  I won't practice too much.  I'll probably just play for sure to get ready for the British.
Q. Disappointed overall?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, yeah.  Obviously I want to be playing.  I feel like this course sets up very well for me.  I'm driving it good, especially today.  I got back where I'm really comfortable with the driver.  It's going right where I'm looking.  Usually when that happens I play very well.  But it doesn't matter how good you hit it, if you struggle on the greens, there's nothing you can do.
Q. Dustin, what is the meaning of the U.S. Open to you?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: This is the United States Open.  It's a major, it means a lot to me.  I'm definitely disappointed I'm not playing the weekend, but there is a lot I can take out of it.  I feel like I'm striking it very well.  So I just need to go home, relax a little bit, hang out with the family and I'll see you at the Open Championship in a month.
Q. Diaper changing duty?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yes, I'm sure mama's waiting for me to get home so I can help her out.
