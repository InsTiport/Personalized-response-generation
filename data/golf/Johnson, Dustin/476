   TIGER WOODS: Both teams made a lot of birdies. Hard to get the ball close. Just about staying as patient as possible. Both sides did make a lot of birdies, very difficult day. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just find the fairways. It was very difficult. 
 TIGER WOODS: We both played well, just want to earn a point for the team. The greens just aren't holding, and it's just very hard. You have to play the wind on the putts. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: We both played well all day long. On a normal day the ball goes left-to-right but in the wind -- it's really hard.
