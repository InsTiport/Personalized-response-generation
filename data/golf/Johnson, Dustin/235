DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's very breezy and really gusty at times.  The hardest part is putting.  Just on the last hole before this, I had a 10-footer.  It's just very difficult putting in this wind.
Q. Your playing a difficult opponent with Martin Kaymer, but trying to close out a match, how challenging is that?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's difficult.  I'm 4-down with 4 to go and I was on 15, and I'm right in front of the green in two -- I mean on my drive.  I hit my second shot and he was in the bunker.  I had a pretty easy shot.  I hit it just a fraction too hard, just straight downwind.  And I end up losing the hole.  But made two birdies here to halve the hole on 16.
Q. Another quick start.  You're 3-up early in the match.  I imagine you're anxious to get off the golf course.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was windy.  You weren't really hitting full shots.  It was all -- you're playing the wind.  Played very tough out here today.  Tee shots, approach shots, putts, chips, it wasn't very easy, that's for sure.
Q. I thought the wind was blowing hard enough to actually affect the roll of the golfball on the greens?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It did.  You had to play the wind in putts.  So that made it difficult, especially around the back nine.  It felt like it picked up a lot so you're really having to play the wind on the putts.
Q. Ryder Cup teammate Jimmy Walker here on Friday?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, got another tough match.  I feel like all my matches are going to be tough.  But just have to go out and play solid golf again.
