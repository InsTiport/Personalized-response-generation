 Q.   4‑under 67, pretty good start.   Maybe just talk a little bit about the round, how the golf course played.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Got off to a good start, birdied the first hole.   Just kind of kept it in play, hit a few good shots and rolled in a few good putts.   I got in a little trouble on 6, the par‑5, I had a lost ball, and ended up making 4 with my second ball and ended up making bogey.   But other than that played pretty good all day.  
   
 Q.   Talk about starting on that back side how important it is to get off to a good start.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it is.   I started on the front today, but yeah, starting on the back you've definitely got to get off to a good start.   10, 11, 12 are very tough.   Today the golf course is in great shape.   It played‑‑ the greens are starting to firm up a little bit, so I've got no complaints on the course.   
   
 Q.   How is it playing different this week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I don't think the course is much different than it was in the U.S. Open.   Today there wasn't much wind, so that definitely helps.   This golf course, if it gets windy, it gets really hard to hit the fairways, and if you don't drive it in the fairway this golf course is very tough.   
   
 Q.   Do you think this is as easy as you're going to see it maybe?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   With no wind, yeah.   If the wind picks up it's going to get really tough.   But today they had it set up very well.   With no wind, you've got to kind of attack the golf course.   
   
 Q.   What was it like to play this course dry?   It was just submerged the last time you were here?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, we played it dry for the first couple days, I think, if I remember correctly, and then it got‑‑ then it rained for the weekend maybe.   It was nice to play it dry and with nice weather.   The weather out there is perfect.   
   
 Q.   Did it feel‑‑ you've been here for a U.S. Open.   Did it feel a little different from a regular tournament or did it feel like a little bit more?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Um, not really.   It's the FedExCup, so it's an important tournament.   It was maybe not quite the feel of a U.S. Open, but it's definitely‑‑ it's a big event.   It's the first event of the Playoffs, and this is one week where you definitely‑‑ if you play well, you can move up the leaderboard a lot.
