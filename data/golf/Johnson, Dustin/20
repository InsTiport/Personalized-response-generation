  Q. Just tell me a little bit about your round today.
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it wasn't too bad.  Just didn't drive it in the fairway enough.  But I mean, honestly, I felt like I rolled it really well, but I just didn't make any putts.  And I think that was the difference of shooting a couple under, and I shot a few over.
 But hit a lot of good putts.  Going to go work on the irons a little bit.  Hit one real bad iron shot on 7, but other than that, felt like I managed the course pretty well and played decent.  I just didn't make any putts.  Felt like -- and I hit good ones.
 Get a little better with the reads tomorrow and maybe drive it in the fairway a little bit more, but other than that, I feel pretty good about -- 3-over is not -- I didn't play great, didn't make any putts.  So obviously tomorrow if I shoot a few under, I'll get back in the golf tournament.
 Q. What's it going to take tomorrow to get on the other side of par?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Just see a couple putts go in would be nice, and obviously -- if I drive it in the fairway I'm going to give myself good looks.
