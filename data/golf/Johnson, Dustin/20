Q. You had the lead by five to begin the day.  You had a lot of really strong players getting close to you and got within two.  What's it like playing with a large lead like that?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, it's a difficult golf course, so no lead is really safe.  You know, I knew I was going to have to come out and play really well.  Got off to a really good start, missed a couple putts there on the back side.  Just obviously if you don't drive it in the fairway, it's a difficult golf course.
But I hit the fairways when I needed to coming down the stretch, and yeah, I mean, obviously the guys gave me a good fight today.
Q. You normally don't state your goals publicly, not even privately.  Dan just mentioned that you went out this week and said, I need to win this week.  Why was winning the FedExCup, winning here at the TOUR Championship, so important?  Why was it important for you to tell people that?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I didn't say I needed to win.  I wanted to win.  I wanted to be a FedExCup champion.  That was something that in my career I would like to be, and obviously today I got the FedExCup.
Yeah, very proud of the way I played.  Obviously I played really good over the last -- especially the last four tournaments.  Yeah, so I'm looking forward to it.
Obviously got a few days off and then the U.S. Open, so not really much of a break, but yeah, I'm definitely pleased to be FedExCup champion.
