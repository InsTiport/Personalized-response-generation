 Q. Can you take anything from the last two Majors, even though they didn't turn out the way you wanted?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, obviously I played really well, other than the final round at Pebble Beach, you know. The PGA, I played really good on Sunday. 
 So I know what it takes, I know what it's like to be in the position, so it definitely helps. But you got to get yourself in position for it to help you at all. So if I'm never in position, then it never will help.

 Q. Obviously you played a lot more golf after the PGA, but was there any lingering affect at all in your mind?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, a couple weeks later I won in Chicago, so it definitely helps. The game's getting back to where it was back last summer where I played really well for a lot of events in a row. 
 So I'm looking forward to this week and just got to put myself in position.
