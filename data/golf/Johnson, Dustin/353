  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm very pleased with my round today.  I thought I played really solid all day.  Obviously the bogey at 9, I hit a poor tee shot there.  And hit a really good chip to even have a 15-footer for par and hit a good putt, just came up a little bit short. All in all I thought I had a great day.Q. Anything out there throw you off?DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I thought the setup was great.  I thought they had some really tough flags and they had some pins that you could get close to.  I thought they did a good job with the setup today for sure.Q. Do you think distance was an advantage?DUSTIN JOHNSON: If I'm driving it straight, yeah.  And I drove it pretty straight today, so that was nice.  I think I only missed three fairways.Q. What was your first impression when you got to this place?DUSTIN JOHNSON: I really liked it.  The first time I played I thought it was great.  I still like it.  It's definitely an interesting golf course.  But I thought it was a lot of fun to play.  And I really enjoyed it today, too.Q. (Inaudible.)DUSTIN JOHNSON: I like using my imagination on shots.  It's always fun to play courses that are different than what you play every day.  I just enjoy playing here.  I enjoy playing over at the British.  It's golf that I really like to play.Q. Did you feel like it was a mental struggle out there for you?DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, you've just got to be smart with your club selection.  You really need to pick out a spot where you're trying to land your golf ball.  I thought I did a really good job with that today.
