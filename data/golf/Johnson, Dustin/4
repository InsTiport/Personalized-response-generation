Q. Give us your thoughts, a couple of birdies last night and one more today on 18?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I played really solid the first two rounds, driving it good.  Hitting pretty good iron shots.  And then times hit a lot of greens.  My speed's been pretty good.  Haven't really holed a lot of putts, but obviously to finish with make a nice little 15-footer there on 18 was nice.
Yeah, then obviously late yesterday afternoon, made a couple birdies.
Q. Coming to the desert, you weren't anticipating driving rain.
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   That's for sure.  Definitely didn't think we were going to get two days of rain.  Obviously we got pretty lucky with the weather, especially yesterday afternoon.  Late in the day it really calmed down.  Then this morning it was raining during the warm up and then after the first hole, kind of quit.  Hopefully be nice for the rest of the day.
Q. You have a terrific record around here, and you've yourself in a decent position again for the next two rounds.
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I like this golf course a lot.  I think it sets up well for me.  I seem to play it okay.  But like I said, I like it, from the first time I played it, it setup good to my eye.  It's got a mixture of golf holes on it.  Some really difficult holes.  And you've got to hit some really good drives and then you've got quite a few short ones, too, where you have to take advantage of.
