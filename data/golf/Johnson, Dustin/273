Q. I guess obviously not the start that you wanted this morning, but you managed to turn thing around nicely.  What happened over the first four holes and what was the key to the tournament?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I really don't know what happened the first four holes.  Just got off to a bad start.  Hit it in a couple awkward spots.  Made some bad bogeys.  But fought back and turned it around and felt like I played really nicely from 14 on in.
Q. I guess all things considered, are you happy where you are heading into the weekend?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, obviously I'd like to play a little better today.  I feel like I played better than that.  But yeah, I'm happy with my position, and I'm looking forward to getting out here tomorrow.
Q. The wind conditions out there, is it tougher today than it was yesterday?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I think it was a little tougher today.  The wind today almost feels like it's a little bit heavier and it's affecting the ball a little bit more, and it's a little bit different direction.  But I mean, you've just got to take advantage of the downwind holes and the into-the-wind holes, just try to get looks.
Q. What did you hit into 16 and 18?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit lob-wedge into 16 and sand wedge into 18.
Q. What did you hit off the tee, did you hit driver off the tee on 18?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, actually my drive hit the tree on the left or it would have been a little bit further down there.
