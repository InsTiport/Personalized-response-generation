DUSTIN JOHNSON: That was obviously the ticket to victory in the sudden death playoff hole.  It was nice to birdie the first hole.  I didn't want to go anymore.   
 Q.  When you finished in regulation on the 17th green, the time in between, is that a good thing or a bad thing that you have a little bit of a gap before you play in a playoff like this?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It doesn't really matter.  I just went inside and chilled for a few minutes.  Then when I saw the guys coming down 18, that's when I went out and hit a few balls to stay loose and be ready to go in the playoff.   
 Q.  How much do you like this format?  You look excited when you beat Jimmy?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, the format, I guess I like it better this year because usually (inaudible) came back and had two good matches.  Played really well yesterday and today to get two good wins.  Definitely very happy about it.   
 Q.  Does this course match up with your game?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm starting to play a little better.  Yesterday I played really well and today I played really well.  Just a little rusty probably, haven't played for a few weeks.  Coming and playing on Wednesday, which is a little bit earlier than normal.  I've had two days to practice.  Just a little rusty.  Played really nicely, very proud of the way I'm playing and very happy with my game right now.  Looking forward to tomorrow.
