 Q.  You played maybe not your best for the first nine holes, out in 37, but ground your way around to a 69.  How proud are you of that today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I definitely struggled a little bit early, but I kind of got it together a little bit there on the back nine and hit some nice shots, holed a couple putts.  Yeah, it was a struggle early but definitely hit it a lot better the last nine holes.   
 Q.  Did you tweak anything mid-round?  Did you change anything?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, just kept swinging.  I knew eventually it was going to start going where I was looking.  Yeah, I don't even know what was going on the first nine holes.  It just was not going well.  I was looking up, and the ball wasn't where I thought it was going to be.   
 Q.  Yesterday we spoke about the fact that you tried to improve your putting this year.  It was a bit streaky last year and you wanted to be more consistent.  How have you gone about that?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just practiced, I've got a consistent practice routine that I'm doing, and yeah, putting is all about repetition and kind of doing the same things.  I've got a good routine and I'm going to stick to it.  It seems like it's working pretty well.  I feel like I rolled it pretty well today.  Yeah, just need to hit a few more fairways and few more greens tomorrow, and I think we'll be okay.   
 Q.  Outside of winning majors, what are your main targets this year?  What do you want to achieve?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just get better.  I feel like I have a lot of room for improvement, and for me, that's kind of the main goal, just get better, and the rest of it will come.
