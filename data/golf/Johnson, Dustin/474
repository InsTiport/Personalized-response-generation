   DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was a tough day, windy, hard. Hit a lot of good shots but missed a couple of short putts early and missed short ones on 10 and 11. That was kind of the match there.

 Q. What were the options you had on 16? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I was fine -- oh, on the third shot. I didn't have anything. You know, I knew he was going to make five, so I had to at worst make five just to push it to 17. So it wasn't really -- I didn't have a stance at all. So there was really no other shot I had other than just kind of chip it. 

 Q. Just in hindsight looking back on your first Presidents Cup, thoughts on the week as a whole? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I had a good time. This competition, it's all about putting, and I would say I had a very average putting -- I missed way too many putts. Didn't make enough. Had a good time, though.
