 Q. Just tell us about your day starting out. I'm sure you were waiting around and then you got a call, right?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I got -- well being I woke up this morning. I had to get here before the first tee time because I was first alternate, so I got here about 6:15. I was sitting in the locker room watching TV and got a text message saying I was teeing off at 8:30. It was pretty exciting.

 Q. Did you have enough time to get ready?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, plenty of time. About 7:00 o'clock I think I found out I was in.

 Q. How much practice did you do here? Did you play some practice rounds here anyway?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I got down here Sunday afternoon, so I played Monday and Tuesday and practiced a little bit Wednesday. 

 Q. How do you mentally prepare after you get the call to actually be ready to go out there? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I prepared all week like I was going to play. So when I got the call I was happy that I got in. I mean, I was already prepared to play.

 Q. Happy with your round?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was okay, solid. I made one bad hole, but other than that, I played pretty solid. It wasn't too bad.

 Q. Had you figured out in the practice rounds which holes you had to throttle back on and which ones you could go after with the driver? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of -- I hit a lot of 2-irons and 3-woods. There's only a few holes I hit driver on.

 Q. Just two?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, probably five holes I hit driver on.

 Q. Do you remember which holes you hit driver on? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Pretty much all the long par-4s and the par-5s. 

 Q. Did the practice rounds kind of give you a pretty good clue that you would have to gear it back?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Oh, yeah. That's why we play practice rounds, so you can figure out how far you want to hit it off the tee.

 Q. You were 2-under early, probably feeling pretty good?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I was playing good, and I hit a bad tee ball on 9 and made bogey. Still had a good six feet for par. And then just made double bogey on 14.

 Q. What happened there? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit it in the left bunker and then just short of the green, and then I chipped it over the green after that and then didn't get up-and-down. 

 Q. You were talking about the three times you played across the street in February when usually it was cold and windy. Was it nice playing here in these conditions?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, the weather was awesome today. The wind was blowing just a little bit. It's kind of swirling out there. But it was definitely nice. The last few times I've played down here it's probably been 45 degrees.

 Q. Who sent you that text message telling you --
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: PGA TOUR.

 Q. What time was that?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Like 7:00 o'clock.

 Q. It was just PGA TOUR? Which person? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, they have a text messaging program where they send it to all the players.

 Q. Does it just say, "you're playing?" 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it gave me my tee time and who I was playing with.

 Q. It didn't say, congratulations, you're in? What exactly does it say? What does it read?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: It gives you your round 1 tee time and your round 2 tee time and who you're playing with.

 Q. Does it use text message language?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No (laughing).

 Q. It's that informal, they sent you a text?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, no, there was a rules official that came by to tell me, too.

 Q. Would you have been disappointed if you didn't get the chance to play, being the first alternate?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I mean, I kind of expected not to get in as first alternate. But it just so happened I did. 

 Q. Kind of hard to pass up a $9.5 million event. You were probably thinking your odds weren't very good just from that standpoint?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I prepared like I was going to play, but I didn't think I was going to. 

 Q. Were you just at home when you received that or were you here already?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I was here this morning.

 Q. Did you celebrate? Were you excited? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I just grabbed my sticks and went out to the practice tee.

 Q. Where was your caddie?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: He was already here. He was waiting.
