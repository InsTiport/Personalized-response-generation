Q.   Dustin, how good did it feel to compete out there for 18 holes?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, well today was the first day I got on the course, but definitely felt good.   Played and putted pretty good, solid round of golf.   It was really tough out there, especially putting.   I had three 3‑putts.   It was really hard to get the speed down. 

Q.   4‑under par, happy with the way you played or should have been lower?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I played really well.   Just the three 3‑putts, could have been a little bit lower. 
I hit the ball really well.   I only missed one green and in this wind, that's pretty good.   Drove it pretty well, too.   Just it's really tough once you get on the green.   I had three 3‑putts, but other than that, I played really solid.   I made some short ones but you know, it's just tough to read them and with this much wind, you've got a right‑to‑left putt and the wind is coming off the left and you're playing outside left, that's tough. 

Q.   We are seeing a lot of players back off; is there a lot of oscillating of the ball going on on the greens? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, the ball is really not moving.   But it's the gusts of wind that kind of blow you off balance; so you're oscillating a little bit.
