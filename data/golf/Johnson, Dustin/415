Q.   I guess right now you're kind of riding the bubble.   You get the round completed, and I thought you played really well considering the conditions. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it played pretty tough this morning.   It was long, and it was raining all day.   But I played pretty solid all week, just rolled the ball good, just nothing went in the hole.   Just had a lot of good opportunities and just missed a lot of short putts.

Q.   You're pretty much right on the bubble as far as top 30 is concerned.   That's going to change player by player as scores are posted.   Is that something you're going to be following here in the next 24 hours?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm not really going to watch it too much.   We're just going to have to see what happens.   Hopefully I make it, but if I don't, get 'em next time.

Q.   You had 267 into 18.   Was the top 30 on your mind as you hit that shot, or were you just trying to post the lowest number possible?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I was trying to make birdie.   I just hit it fat.   It was wet‑‑ I really didn't hit it fat, just some water got in between the club face and the ball, and it just came out dead.
