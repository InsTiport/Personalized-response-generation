Q. Talk about your round today and getting out there early this morning and getting going?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought I got off -- obviously birdied the first hole.  I drove it very well today.  I was pleased with that.  Hit the driver really good.  Hit a lot of fairways.  Never really got out of position on the tee.  I think that was the big key for me today.
Didn't roll it all that great, but I'm pleased with the score.
Q. Probably the first time since Oakmont you didn't shoot yourself in the foot the first round.  Were you thinking about that?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hadn't been swinging that good.  I definitely hadn't had a lot of confidence in the driver.  This week, I worked hard on it and I got a lot of confidence in the driver.  I feel like I'm swinging it really well.  Got control over it finally.  The ball is kind of starting where I want it to.  It's got the right shape.
Out here, it's a big key.  You have got to hit the fairways.  That's what I did well today.  I hit a lot of fairways.  Definitely could have shot a little bit better but it's 1-under.  I think anything under par on this golf course is a pretty good score.
Q. What is most difficult about this course?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: The greens, for sure.  The greens they are really fast.  I thought they had a lot of difficult pins out there today.  That's what is very tough about this golf course.
Q. What did you do on 14 (inaudible)?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I probably shouldn't have.  Been a much easier pitch from just short of that bunker than it was from where I was hitting from.
Q. Talking about the start, though, it's hard to have to make up six, seven, eight shots out of the gate.  Is this at least a better way to start for you?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I got off to a good start.  I felt like I played solid today.  Like I said, I hit it well.  Only a few shots back.  In a major, a few shots can be one hole.
I feel like the golf course is going to continue to get tougher if get no rain.  It's just firming up.  The greens have gotten a lot firmer from yesterday to today.
Q. On 15, you had 290 uphill.  Did you think there was any way you were getting that ball over the green?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I knew the club I had I needed the wind to be hurting for it to not go long.  But I mean I was pleased with where it ended up.
Q. Was it a 3-wood?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit 3-wood and I hit it right at the flag.  I was happy with where it ended up.
