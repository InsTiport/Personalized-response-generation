Q.   Dustin, a brief respite for the American team amidst all the blue on the board.   Were you watching the scoreboards and have any idea what was going on on the rest of the course?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I really didn't.   I was trying not to look at the scoreboard.   I was trying to just focus on my match and do what I could do to help the team today.   Obviously when I got done, I looked up at the board and they got the‑‑ it looked like they've gotten four points already, which is‑‑ they played really well early.   But I'm happy to get my point, and hopefully guys behind me can pull through.
