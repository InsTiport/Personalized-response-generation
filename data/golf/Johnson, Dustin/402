 Q.   One shot back, you have to be loving it.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, no, I played pretty good.   I left a few out there, but I played solid, made a couple good up‑and‑downs to save par on the last hole there.   But I played pretty good all day.   Just kept it in play.   I hit a couple bad drives, but they were still in play, so it was all right.  
   
 Q.   9 was wacky, you hit the pin, it spun on back and then you make the trim.   That was unreal.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, because I hit a great shot in there.   I chipped a little 8‑iron to take the spin‑off and flew it right in the hole and it came back all the way off the front and I had a pretty hard chip.   But I chipped it in the hole.   I said it was karma, because I got kind of screwed on the shot coming in, but then I was able to chip one in.   So it was nice.  
   
 Q.   Then the miss at 17 hurt a little bit.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I hit a great putt, but the greens are so soft, it's late in the day, a lot of people have been going through there, but I hit a great putt.   It hit the hole too, I still couldn't believe it didn't go in.   But I'm really pleased with it.   With how it went today.  
   
 Q.   You played so well here the first five years and last year you missed the cut, did that kind of simmer a little bit last year and did you come in this year more prepared?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I just played horrible last year.   I played bad, putted bad, did everything bad last year.   But right now my game's pretty good and I'm feeling ‑‑ I got a lot of confidence in it and so I'm feeling a little better this year than I did last year.   
   
 Q.   How about playing with John, is that always kind of a kick for you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Oh, yeah, he's great.   He's fun to play with.   A lot of talent.   I mean, and then obviously playing with Wayne and Kid Rock is pretty cool too.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever had anything like what happened on No. 9 happen?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Oh, yeah, I don't know about hitting it and then chipping it in, but I've hit the pin and made birdie before.   But that one was‑‑ I never had anything like that, where it came 40 yards away and I pitched it in.   
   
 Q.   Happy to get it in today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it was great, we were off first, so we definitely get to finish.   But I think everybody might have a chance to get in.   It will be close.   So, but, yeah, definitely happy we're done.  
   
 Q.   You're probably happy, it seems you've historically played well in bad weather.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I was happy playing this morning.   It didn't the bother me.   I was dressed for it.   I was fine.   We were cruising.   Wayne just made birdie on 2 with sideways rain and so we were ready to go.  
   
 Q.   Have you been following the team?   You're right up at the top.   Is Wayne carrying that?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, I shot 4‑under, no bogeys.   So, he cut me six shots.   So that's pretty good.   He made four birdies and then ‑‑ and it was never on the same hole and like two of them were on shot holes.   So it was‑‑ he cut me a lot there.   
   
 Q.   A lot of people don't like playing Spyglass because it's tough.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   This is one of my favorites.   Here and Pebble.   I mean I love all the courses up here, but I just‑‑ I'll always enjoy playing here at Spyglass.   It's fantastic.   
   
 Q.   Did you ever have a bogey free round here?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, because even when I shot 63, I think I bogeyed the last hole.   So I shot 63 here, I think, one year and bogeyed the last hole or 64.   One of them.   But, yeah, I think I 3‑putted 18.   That was my only bogey.   But, yeah, I haven't had many bogey‑less rounds period.   
(Laughter.) I mean even when I played really well, it seems like I always make one bogey or something.   So I'm happy.   I can't complain.   I'm right where I want to be.   It's a long week, just kind of just keep playing.   
   
 Q.   You were talking about courses that you really enjoy playing, and you talked in the past about Augusta, growing up close to that, how that fits.   How does that setup for your game with sight lines?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Augusta?   I love it.   It sets up good for me.   I draw the ball, so it's‑‑ you got to hit a lot of draws out there, which I love.   So it sets up well off the tee.   And it's‑‑ I just, I wouldn't care if it didn't setup good for me, I would still love it.  
   
 Q.   Is there a particular stretch that you feel like in general is good for you to take advantage of?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   At Augusta you just got to play the par‑5s well.   The par‑5s, you play those well, for me, shoot a good score, there's a few holes, I think 10, 11‑‑ 9, 10, 11, 12 are tough holes.   If you can play those even par, then that's good.   But ‑‑ really good.   I'll take it every time, even par, 9, 10, 11, and 12.   And then take advantage of the par‑5s.   
   
 Q.   Is there going to be anything in particular you're going to have to do this year to play that well?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, just keep doing what I always do.   
   
 Q.   Your preparation typically is what?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I don't do anything different going into a Major.   
   
 Q.   What is better?   What are you doing better now that you weren't doing last year at this time?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm just a lot more consistent.   Like with my swing I've been ‑‑ last year I was really inconsistent, I don't know what it was, but I just didn't‑‑ just wasn't very consistent with my play.   And then just a lot of it has to do with short game and putting.   But, so if ‑‑ I've been working hard on the putter and could still probably do a little more work in the bunkers.   But other than that, I mean my short game's always chipping and pitching, I always feel really good with that.   Just the bunkers I could get better at.  
   
 Q.   Have you done any changes in coaching on putting?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No.   I work by myself.   
   
 Q.   Is there a letter grade for your brother's performance so far?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   He's doing well.   Yeah, he's fine.   I like having him out there.   He keeps me focused.   So it works out really well.
