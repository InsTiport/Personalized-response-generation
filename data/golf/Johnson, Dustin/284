Q. Happier with your round or with the College World Series?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: College World Series for sure.  That's awesome to see Coastal get it done.  First time ever making it to the College World Series and then winning a national championship, that's pretty special, especially they had a couple elimination games that they had to win and they got it done, so that was pretty cool.
Q. How did you find out about it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: My scorer was -- he kept track for me.  He was following along on his phone, so I would ask him every little bit to see what was going on.
Q. Did he tell you what was going on in the last inning?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, yeah, somebody told me what happened.  I guess it was 4-3 and then they had a guy on third and we struck him out, the guy at the plate.  That was pretty cool.
Q. Did it feel good just to get back and playing?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it did.  It felt good.  I was pretty pleased with my round.  I thought it was pretty solid, especially -- I didn't practice too much last week.  I didn't expect a whole lot today.  I always expect to play well, but this golf course is playing tough.  I felt like I played pretty solid all day.
Q. Does it remind you of Oakmont in the sense that you've got to hit the fairway to have a chance of doing anything?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, the rough is deep, fairways are narrow.  It's definitely a premium on hitting the fairway.  It was just like that.  This year the green speeds are a couple feet slower than normal, but we're playing in the middle of the summer instead of at the end of it.
But the golf course is in perfect shape, and it was still playing tough.
Q. Do the fairways look narrower because they have trees on them as opposed to Oakmont?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Always the fairways look narrow.  It doesn't matter where you're at.
