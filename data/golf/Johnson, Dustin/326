Q. Reflections on the round, looking that you're on the cusp now of missing.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I played terrible.  Didn't drive it very good.  Didn't hit irons very good.  Didn't do anything really that good.
Q. Was it the double bogey -- if it wasn't for that --
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I'd have been fine.  I wasn't playing good.  I didn't play good yesterday, either.  It wasn't -- at least yesterday I drove -- with the driver, I drove it pretty well.  Today I did not.  And you don't hit the driver very well, you're going to struggle.
Q. First time out here; an event you'd like to come back to maybe?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I like the golf course.  I feel like I should play really well here.  I can hit my 2-iron around here a bunch.  There's a few holes where you hit driver but you just got to hit the fairways, and I was just barely missing them, which is no good.
Q. Is it just one of those days, one of those tournaments?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, just -- it is what it is.  I'm not too worried about it.
Q. You don't see it as a wasted trip?  You've enjoyed coming out?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I've enjoyed it.  I'd like to come back for sure.  Get a little bit of revenge, too.  I felt like, like I said, I felt like I should play very well here.
