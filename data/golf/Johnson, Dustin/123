 Q.  Assessment of the week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was all right.  I mean, I felt like I fought hard, but I didn't have my best stuff.  But I kind of hung around there.  Today I played a lot better, hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in the hole.  I definitely played better today.  The first two days I just grinded out the scores.   
 Q.  Did you have an idea on 18 that if you would have made that putt you would have been projected to be No. 1?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, but it doesn't -- I wanted to make it no matter what.  It didn't matter if it was -- whatever it was.  I would have hit it the same way.  It just didn't break.   
 Q.  When did you switch to the cross-handed?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yesterday on No. 6.   
 Q.  Had you practiced it before?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: For a little bit.   
 Q.  When is the last time you switched putting grips mid-tournament?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Never.   
 Q.  When is the last time you putted cross-handed?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Never.   
 Q.  Were you desperate?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  I don't know.  I did it a few times on the putting green.  Sometimes I do it on the putting green just to get my setup a little bit better because it just levels out my shoulders.  And I don't know, I was putting well.  I hit some bad putts for the first five holes, so after I hit a really bad putt for eagle on 6, the next one I tried it, I made it, so I kept it going.  I putted really well today.  The last hole I hit a good putt.  I just felt like it was going to turn and it didn't turn.  I hit it a fraction too hard.  That's the only thing, speed is a little suspect because I'm not used to it, but I'm rolling it on good lines.   
 Q.  Will we see it in Paris?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: We're going to stick with it for now.  We'll try it.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on Tiger, he looks like he's going to win, coming back after five years of not winning?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, he played well, obviously.  He's played well, he putted well this week.  These greens are really good.  If you get it rolling in the right direction, it goes in for sure.  But yeah, winning here is a big win.  It's the 30 guys who are playing the best on TOUR this year.  It's definitely a good win.
