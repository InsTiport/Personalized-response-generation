  Q. Dustin Johnson, even par 70.  Dustin, what do you take away from the week?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's a good week, tough golf course.  I struggled on the greens a little bit.  That was probably the biggest thing for me is just didn't hole enough putts.  I gave myself enough chances, but, yeah, I just didn't putt well enough.  I felt like I hit a lot of good putts, just none that went in the hole.  That's kind of my story.
 Q. What do you think it's going to take today for these two guys that seem to be battling it out at the top?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Obviously, missing in the correct spots.  As long as you do that, you give yourself a chance.  I mean, you've still got to hit nice shots, but coming down the stretch, obviously, really 13 through 18 are very difficult.
 So, yeah, whoever can play those the best is going to win.
 Q. What's your schedule now going forward?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm going to play CJ, ZOZO, probably Houston and Augusta.
