 Q. Is there any putt that you want to have back?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: All of them that didn't go in. Yeah, I had a lot of great looks. I felt like I hit some pretty good putts that maybe the speed I hit a couple just a fraction too hard, but out here just a fraction off you miss. So, I hit a lot of good putts, I thought I made, that didn't go in, so just I felt like I played tee to green just as good as anyone and I just didn't hole enough putts.   
   
 Q. After that double on 5, you made quite a charge, you had to feel ‑‑  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I did. I did. Obviously there, that's situation where it can go one of two ways and I came right back and made a nice putt for birdie on 6 and then I made a good four on 7 and then birdied 8 and birdied 9. So, I felt like I came back really good after that and made, played really solid all day, just had some great looks, just didn't make them.   
   
 Q. When did you sense like, hey, I'm right there?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Oh, I mean I knew ‑‑ on 15 and then 15 I pulled it left and I was over behind the trees and I hit through a hole about as big around as a baseball and knocked it on the green. It might be one of the better shots I've ever hit.   
   
 Q. What did you hit?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: 6‑iron. And I had 20 feet straight up the hill for eagle and just misread it a little bit.   
   
 Q. Can you describe the atmosphere on the back nine?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was great. Obviously, I didn't know that he had trouble on 12 or whatever hole he had some trouble on, but yeah, I mean the atmosphere was great, had a lot of fun and looking forward to next year. I feel like I'm getting better each year, so I'm looking forward to it.
