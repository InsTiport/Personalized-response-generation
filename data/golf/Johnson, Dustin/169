Q. 64 today, no jet-lag?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I felt pretty good out there today.  I did everything really well.  I mean, 64, it was a pretty easy 64.  I hit it really well.  I had a lot of great looks.  I didn't really hole any putts, really, until I made two nice putts on 17 and 18.  But other than that, it was just really solid all day long.  Hit a lot of great shots.  Had a lot of looks at birdies, which is what I need to do the next two days if I want to have a chance to win on Sunday.
Q. Driving it very well.  How much are you in love with this great layout?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I like the golf course.  I did well here last year, and especially using, I got the new M4 in the bag and driving it really well with it.  I'm very pleased with it and pleased with all my clubs right now.  I've got a lot of confidence and you know, just need to go out tomorrow and put up a low one again.
Q. Tommy just described that as the most stress-free 64 he's ever seen.  How would you describe it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was pretty easy for a 64.  I did everything really well.  I drove it well.  I hit a lot of really good iron shots.  Hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in the hole from pretty close range, but all day, I gave myself really good chances for birdies.  Yeah, it was pretty stress-free.
Q. For you what was the difference between yesterday and today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I just swung it a little better.  I worked on some things on the range this morning.  You know, I don't know if it had to do with a little jet-lag or what.  I just wasn't feeling that great yesterday, a little stiff.  But this morning I got in the gym and then I came out and worked on my game a little bit before we teed off.  Yeah, I did everything a lot better today.
Q. Got yourself right back in the tournament heading into the weekend.  Silly question, but have you got anything to work on?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just kind of keep doing exactly what I did today, hopefully give myself chances.  I'm only four back going into the weekend, so we've still got 36 holes to go.  I just need to play some good, solid golf and get myself right back in there for Sunday.
