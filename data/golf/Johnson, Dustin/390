 Q.   Dustin, it started out pretty hot yesterday, wasn't quite as tidy today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I've played‑‑ I mean maybe not quite as good, but I still had a lot of looks at birdies and a lot of really good looks, just really didn't roll anything in.   Didn't hit great shots coming down the stretch, but just really hadn't made any putts.   I made a couple of good par putts about 8‑footers, but other than that just not rolling in.   Rolling good putts, just burning the edge, had a couple of chips lip out and just burning the hole.   So hopefully they'll go in tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   The golf course playing a little different this morning?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it wasn't playing quite as fast this morning as it was yesterday afternoon, but the golf course is great.   It's in good shape.   Just going to have to come out and get after it tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Short game, putting something you have to work on over the weekend?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   The short game's fine, just need to hole some putts.  
   
 Q.   Just some comments on your round today, if we can, please.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It was okay, just didn't hole the putts, got a couple bad kicks.   Other than that I played pretty solid again today, just got to hole some putts.   That's all it is.  
   
 Q.   It seemed like with the weather it's a little better with the cloud covering playing early?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it wasn't quite as fast as it was yesterday, but the course is perfect.   It's playing really good.  
   
 Q.   What do you like about playing Colonial?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I mean, it's a good event.   They do a great job here.   The golf course is good, it's fun to play, and get a lot of fans too so that's nice.  
   
 Q.   Not totally the kind of round you wanted today, but you do have yourself in good position headed into the weekend.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, for sure.   Didn't play quite as good as I did yesterday, but still could have shot a good score today.   Just it's all about getting it in the hole.   I struggled a little bit with the putter today.   Holed a couple decent putts, but I had a lot of good looks early, and didn't really hole anything.  
   
 Q.   What kind of score wins this tournament?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I don't know.   I would say probably around 15, 16, whatever the normal score.
