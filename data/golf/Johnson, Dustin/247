 Q.  You came in here yesterday, and you changed putters and went away from the putter that you used from the start of BMW last year and went with just a different look.  Didn't pan out and now you brought the old one off the bench and it responded.  What was your thinking today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it didn't go so well.  Yesterday I putted really bad.  It wasn't a big deal that I put it back into play, and rolled it a little bit better today.   
 Q.  You struck it well yesterday.  So I'm sure you weren't thinking about this maybe being an early trip.  Having a quick trip home; did that thought enter your mind?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  I mean, yesterday, even par was about the worst I could have shot yesterday.  I mean, I didn't make one putt.  So I knew as long as I played halfway decent today, I was going to get right back in there.   
I mean, still, after two days, the par 5s -- I played eight of them at even par, no birdies.  Over the weekend, I really need to take advantage of the par 5s.   
 Q.  I've learned, and it's been confirmed, that you are going to enter Farmers and you have entered Farmers.  What was your thinking, was it just a matter of wanting to play more golf coming up with Pebble and L.A. after Farmers?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I had always been committed to play Farmers.  I was kind of on the fence whether I was going to do it or not.  Yeah, I need to play.  I want to get some more reps on the PGA TOUR.  I've only played two events this season, so I need to get a couple more in, because I really don't play that many from now to Augusta.  I'll play Farmers, Pebble, L.A., WGC, Match Play and Augusta.
