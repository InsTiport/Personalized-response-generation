DUSTIN JOHNSON: I wish I could blame it on the wind.  Just struggling a bit with the irons, not hitting the shots I wanted to.  I hit a few good shots out there.  But today was really tough.  Yesterday I just didn't play very well.  But today was very difficult.  I felt like I drove it all right.  I hit a pretty good drive on the last hole, I just didn't think I was going to reach that bunker.  You hit it in a bunker, and you're going to have a tough time getting a par.   
But overall I felt like today was all right.  I missed two short putts yesterday on 17.  Today on 5.  That put me at even or right at 1-over, I guess.  And it's pretty solid.  It could definitely get a lot better.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, this direction makes the golf course play really difficult because it's a lot of -- you're kind of crosswind on pretty much every hole.  You get a couple of holes -- not too many holes in the wind, maybe two holes downwind, maybe a couple of tee shots, 1 and 10 and 4 is about the only holes you get downwind, the rest of them are crosswind.  It seems like today we played a lot of in and across.  I bogeyed the last hole.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I guess I'm not playing that good, but I'm getting it up around the green.  And my short game has been really good.  I've chipped and putted it really well the last two days.  But just not striking it that well with the irons.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean it's tough to figure out if it's going to help it or hurt it off the tee there.  And I had 290 I think to get into the bunker, and I hit 2-iron, it bounced off the back wall.  It's a tough -- I did pull it a little bit and it came out a little bit hot.  But, yeah, it's definitely difficult to figure out the yardages out there today.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean if the weather stays up, hopefully we get this weather the next two days.  If I could go out tomorrow morning and shoot a good score, I can get myself back in the golf tournament.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, he's playing pretty good.  He's 1-under par.  That's pretty good through two rounds.  Obviously got off to a rough start yesterday, but battled back.  And got off to a really good start today.  But the conditions are very difficult.  It's difficult to putt.  It's difficult to do anything out there today.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, but it's still tough.  I'm used to it.
