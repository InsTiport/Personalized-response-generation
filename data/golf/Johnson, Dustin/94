Q. Nice come back today after that double bogey at 13.  Five birdies on the opening nine.  What changed for you?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well I was hitting it good, I even thought I hit a good shot on 13.  So it wasn't like, I wasn't swinging bad, I just came up a little short there, I think I just got a little wind switch and, but, yeah, I played well today.  A couple mistakes, but other than that this golf course, it's tough and if you get out of position, it's hard to make pars.  The greens are firm and fast and the rough's, it's not like real deep but it's deep enough to where it affects you.  But, yeah, I mean I played really solid, especially after the 13th hole.
Q. Obviously you hadn't been here since 2010, obviously 20 wins on TOUR, when you come back this time does the golf course seem to look and play a little different than you remembered?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I feel like I'm getting around a little better than I did back then, but, yeah, for me it definitely, the golf course, it's the same, I mean it really hasn't changed, but it's just a good golf course.  I mean it's in perfect condition and it's tough.
Q. You said yesterday you felt like you played better than you scored.  How did the play and the score matchup today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: About the same.  Anything under par around here is a good score and I'm happy with the position I'm in.  Could be, it always could be better, but I'm okay with the position, I feel like the golf game's in good form and I'm doing a lot of things very well, just got to eliminate the mistakes over the weekend.
Q. What was your biggest mistake today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I mean I doubled 13, it wasn't -- I didn't feel like I hit a bad shot there either, I thought.
Q. Where did it pitch, do you know?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It landed over the water, I never saw it splash but they said it landed over and bounced back in.  But it wasn't -- I didn't even think the water was in play, much less -- just early the wind, it wasn't much wind, but it was kind of just all over the place, just because it wasn't really blowing and, yeah, I even had a club where I thought it was borderline too much and came up well short of where I thought it would pitch.
Q. Were you in a divot on 14?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yes, I was in big divot in the middle of the fairway.  It was big.  I mean it was long, it was deep, it wasn't -- I don't think it was from a professional.
(Laughter.)
Q. What changed for you on that back nine?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Nothing, I was playing well and it was, I even, I didn't play bad on the back, and I made the turn to the front and just hit some good shots and rolled in a couple putts.
Q. At this stage of the season is it important to feel like the game is good regardless of where you are on the leaderboard?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Absolutely, but for me it's important to feel like the game's good at any time during the season.  But, yeah, I feel like the game's in good form, I'm seeing a lot of good things, even today where I got off to kind of a rough start, brought it back and played really solid the rest of the day.
Q. Do you enjoy a course like this where scoring's tough, pars mean something?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I do, I like it.  For me it's a good golf course, you know if you shoot under par it's a good score and you're going to have a chance going into the weekend.
