 Q.   How so far in the Playoffs would you assess your play?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I think my play has been solid.   I struggled a little bit today, but the course is playing pretty tough today.   The wind out there is pretty windy.   But I had a bunch of chances on the back nine, just couldn't convert on any of my chances.   Hit some good putts, just nothing was going in.  
   
 Q.   It could have been a shootout today, but it didn't turn out‑‑ seems like everybody but Rory are going to probably say similar things.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   You know, I thought I played pretty well, other than I hit one really bad tee shot on the last hole, but‑‑ it matters, but I was out of it.   Making the turn, I missed short ones on 10, 11, 12, 13.   I had some really good chances to make birdie and didn't make any of them.  
   
 Q.   You top sixed in all playoff events and you'll be top seven going into the TOUR Championship.   Are you okay with that?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I'm okay with that.   I think I've got to be.   I'm in a spot where if I win the last tournament, then I'm going to win.  
   
 Q.   What's your overall impressions of this golf course over the four days?   Was it challenging?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I thought it was good.   When it's soft with ball in hand, we're going to shoot some good scores, but the greens were perfect.   The course was definitely gettable, but you had to hit good shots out there.  
   
 Q.   Would you like to be back?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I think it's a good course.   I like the golf course.   Sets up well for me.   
   
 Q.   Could this course stand up to a PGA Championship?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, if it was firm and fast.   I'd like to play it firm and fast.
