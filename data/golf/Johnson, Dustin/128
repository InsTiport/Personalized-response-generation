Q. Just talk about first how you rebounded on the closing holes.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I felt like I've played all right today.  I just did not make any putts.  I felt like I hit the putts in the right spots.  I just -- you know, I lipped out, I think, seven or eight times today.  So it was just -- I don't know.  Can't really explain it.  Had a couple from the fairway a couple times there.  On 14 I had a mud ball, and it came left and caught the tree and went double.  And it came out and just went left and caught the tree, and I made double.  That's after horseshoing a three-footer for bogey.
But you know, it was just missed a bunch of little short putts.  Hitting the hole and not going in.  That pretty much sums it up.  This golf course, it's not -- you can make some birdies, but you've got to hole the short putts, and I just didn't today.
Q. Is there a 65 out there tomorrow with the course being receptive, especially the greens being receptive?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: There is.  I need to go out and shoot 8, 9, 10 under if I want a chance, and it's there.  I can do it.  I've just got to -- you've got to roll the rock.
Q. Have you seen the course change much, especially since you were playing earlier versus this afternoon?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was softer -- it was definitely soft with all the rain they got yesterday.  It felt like the fairways definitely were softer than they were on Friday.  But, yeah, hopefully it will dry out a little bit.  I still had a couple mud balls, which, you know, it happens.  Soft fairways, it's going to happen.
