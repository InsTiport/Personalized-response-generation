Q.   Well played today.   I know bogey at 18, but other than that, you played well?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I did.   I played really good.   18 is playing really tough.   It's just a tough hole.   I was aiming a little further right off the tee than I should have been.   I could cover the water today, so it was no problem. 
Just blocked it.   I hit two bad drives today.   One on 3, I made a really good bogey on 3.   And 18, I made bogey there.   But those are the only two drives that I missed. 
Other than that, I drove it really well and hit some really quality iron shots.   Out here, it's hard‑‑ well, I thought it was really hard to get it close to the hole.   Holed some good putts, too.   I was really pleased with my round today. 

Q.   Looking back to last year, you finished fourth.   How much has this golf course changed in a year? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, from last year to this year, it has not changed, but before that, it changed a lot.   15‑, 18‑, 19‑under was winning every year, and now, I know someone shot 10‑under today but that's still‑‑ 10‑under at the end of the week is still going to look pretty good I think.   This golf course is really hard. 

Q.   You won the three‑point contest on Tuesday, how was that experience?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It was a lot of fun.   A lot of kids came out, and The First Tee Program is obviously a very, very good cause.   But to win the three‑point contest was a lot of fun.
