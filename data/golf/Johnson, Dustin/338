 Q.  Great 64 today.  How do you assess what happened today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It wasn't any different than the last three days.  Just today I holed some putts.   
I felt like I played really well the last few days, drove it well, thought I was hitting really good iron shots, just wasn't making any putts.   
When I missed a green, I didn't get up-and-down and it was solely because I was just missing them, not making any putts.   
Today I finally rolled in a few putts and it was a lot more fun out there today making some birdies and hitting a lot of good golf shots.   
 Q.  Talk about like how the weather conditions hampered a lot of players games.  Did you feel that this clear day really helped you a lot?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Obviously, the weather was a little bit nicer today but even the last couple days it was playing tough.  But I felt like I was playing really well, just wasn't getting anything out of my rounds.  When I hit -- the golf course is really tough, so when you're hitting good shots and hit it close to the hole and then you're not making them, it gets very frustrating.   
Today finally I capitalized on my good shots.  I was making the putts when I needed to.   
 Q.  This being the end of the playoff season, you're closing on a good note.  Does it makes you feel good about your season?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, coming out today and playing a good solid round and shooting a nice low number was definitely a good end to the season.  It gives me a lot of confidence going in.  I got a week off and then head over to Korea for the Presidents Cup.  So really looking forward to that.
