Q.   Congratulations, 3 & 2 victory.   You needed a little red, white and blue on that board. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, well, I tried not to look at the board all day today.   I had a tough match.   Nic is a great competitor.   We both played really well all day long.   You know, that putt on‑‑ well, I stuffed it in there on 14 for eagle, and then that putt on 15 was huge.

Q.   A lot of people want to know who hits it farther.   He hits it pretty far. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, he can move it out there pretty good.   We're both pretty long. 

Q.   Talk about the experience and how well you played this week. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, it's great.   Being here with the home fans, it definitely makes a difference.   You know, for me to come out and play like I did this week, I'm definitely proud of myself, and I'm excited to be on the team.   I wanted to make Captain Love look good for picking me, too.

Q.   Any thoughts on going for it on 15?   You ended up making the birdie anyway. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, that pin, we looked at it all week, for those left pins if they put them there, it's just not a good idea to go for it.   I don't know, for me it wasn't because I'm going to hit it in that left bunker probably 80 percent of the time, and it's just not good to that pin.

Q.   Talk about the caddie situation.   Did that cause you any problems?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, Weber is great.   We had a good time this week and a lot of fun out there, and he did a great job for me.
