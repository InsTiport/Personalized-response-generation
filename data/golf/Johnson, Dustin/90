 Q. You were level par going out for the front nine then came back nine surge. What were the emotions the thoughts like through holes 13 through to 18?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean there's holes where you can make a move and I knew that if I wanted to do that I needed to play 13 through 18 well. And I feel like if you give yourself some looks on 10, 11 and 12 you're happy, but you'll take pars on those three holes every time you tee it up. And yeah, I felt like I put myself in a good spot and I had some looks at it and I did put a good back nine together, just it wasn't quite good enough.  
   
 Q. Did you pay much attention to the crowd reaction, the changing leaderboards as things were progressing out there?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean on Sunday in the last, as loud as those roars were it's kind of hard not to pay attention so yeah I was looking at it, it doesn't bother me, I kind of, I like to know where I'm at and I did and I knew what I had to do and I felt like I gave it a pretty good shot, I just don't think it was quite good enough.
