   DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, yesterday we teed off really late, so I got off to a really good start, birdied -- had four in a row starting off, birdied 2, 3, 4 and 5, so got off to a really good start. Coming out this morning I had like an 85-yard shot and I hit it to about three feet and I missed it, but other than that I played pretty solid all day and very happy with my score.   
  
  Q. Talk about the fast turnaround.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm swinging well and I'm playing good so I don't mind the fast turnaround. Just going to go grab a quite bite to eat and tee off.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's nice to get out here and get playing. I think we got a good draw where we get to actually keep playing and possibly finish our two rounds.   
  
  Q. Is this kind of like British weather?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, the weather is gorgeous out today.  
  
  Q. What do you think about the course? People have been saying it's maybe the best they've seen it.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, the course is in fantastic shape. The greens are perfect, fairways are good, and the weather is actually cooperating very nicely for us, too.
