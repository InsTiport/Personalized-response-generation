 Q.   Dustin, a captain's wild card, glad he picked you because you wouldn't want to miss this, and how nice to justify his pick.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I'm playing really well coming into this event, and having a great partner like Kuchar, we make a great team.   We keep each other energized and excited out there.   Today we just played really good, solid golf and got a few putts to roll in.   
   
 Q.   Describe the atmosphere from a player's point of view, Matt.   
MATT KUCHAR:   It was so awesome.   I've had one other Ryder Cup experience.   It was Wales, and I thought Wales was incredible.   Being in front of the home crowd, just the volume and the passion for golf, it's just so much fun to be a part of.   
   
 Q.   You were good on the front side, Dustin picked you up on the back side.   Great team effort.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Absolutely.   It's a lot of fun playing with Dustin.   I think we combine very, very well.   We teamed up well.   We've teamed up well in the last.   It's fun to have a guy like him that can take advantage of holes.   My job was to play steady and make some putts, and it was a fun match.  
   
 Q.   Dustin, your game is really at a high level right now.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I'm playing well.   Today I drove it well.   I was in the fairway a lot, so that helps.   A little shaky with the irons here and there, but we can dial those in matter.   But I've got my man Kuch here, he drives it down the middle of every fairway and hits it in the center of every green, so when he gets that putter rolling, I don't think anybody is better.
