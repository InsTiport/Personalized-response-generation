Q. Do you feel pretty good about being in contention?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel great. I think my game's exactly where it needs to be. I feel like I'm playing really solid. I feel like I got control of my game. So I'm looking forward to the year for sure.

Q. You keep knocking on the door, at some point the door has to come down?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm doing all the right things, I hit it in all the right spots, I hit some great shots, and so that was pretty much it. But after making double on 5, I came back and played really well from there to the house, even missed quite a few short ones, not necessarily bad putts, just burning the edges, but I'm definitely pleased with the way I played.
