 Q.  Overall, how do you assess this week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think I played pretty solid.  You know, just thought I putted pretty well today, had a lot of putts I hit that I thought I made and didn't go in.  You know, just -- I had a few -- 11, 12, 17, 16.  I had a few short ones I should have made.  Other than that, it was a pretty solid week.   
I didn't have my best stuff, but I had it good enough to get it done, just, you know, didn't hole enough putts.  That's pretty simple.   
 Q.  Every single week you're up there, what do you take away again?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just got to make some more putts.  Just keep grinding with the putter.   
 Q.  You ready for the U.S. Open?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I am.  I'm playing next week and then U.S. Open.
