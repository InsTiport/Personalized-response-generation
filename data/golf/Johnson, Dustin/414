 Q.   How are you feeling today?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Feeling better.   
   
 Q.   Good start?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it wasn't too bad.   I played pretty well.   Missed a couple short putts, but other than that, I hit it pretty well.   I hit one bad tee ball on 3 and made bogey but I had a really good chance for par and missed about a 4‑ or 5‑footer there.   
Other than that, I hit the ball pretty well and made a couple putts.   It was just a pretty good day.   
   
 Q.   Highlights?   Anything special?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Golf course is good.   I think it's fun to play.   You can reach all the par 5s, a couple short par 4s.   But the greens are really tricky.   They are really firm and they are really fast.   So it just‑‑ you know, you've really got to be careful where you hit the ball on your second shots.   You don't want too many downhill putts because it's hard to stop the ball.   
You know, if you miss the green in the wrong side, you're dead.   
   
 Q.   When we see you coughing and stuff out there, is it affecting you at all?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm fine.   I'm feeling way better than I was.   Just got a little bit of a cough which is‑‑ that's okay.   But yeah, I'm back to where I feel good enough to play good golf.   
   
 Q.   Did anything that happened this morning make you change anything you want to do over the next couple of days or did it play pretty much as you expected?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I think I've got a pretty good game plan for the golf course.   You've got to put it in the fairway out here, and coming into the greens is just where you've really got to think about the shot you're hitting and where you want to hit it.  
   
 Q.   What's your plan for the rest of the day now?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, I've got to do a clinic here on the range for a few minutes and then I don't know, maybe go tool around.   
   
 Q.   Obviously playing with Brett, did he share a few tips with you about how to play?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON.   No.   We were chatting all day but not about the golf course.   
   
 Q.   First few days of a golf tournament, you can't win it but you can certainly lose it.   You've at least put yourself in a position‑‑  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   For me, definitely got to shoot under par.   I don't know what won it last year but it's a golf course where you need to shoot 3‑ or 4‑under each day and maybe have a good day where you shoot 6‑ or 7‑under.
