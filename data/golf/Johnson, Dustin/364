Q.   (No Microphone.)
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I went over the green and made a double bogey. 
But I came right back and made a 3 on 2.
And from there I just played really well. 
I bogeyed 10 from the middle of the fairway, but I got it right back on 13. 
Then made the eagle at 15 and then birdie at 16. 
It was good.   Unfortunately, I bogeyed the last, but it's tough.   I hit the ball really well today.   It was tough to get the ball close to the hole.   I just played the parâ€‘5s really well today. 

Q.   How much were you leaderboard watching aware of what Jordan was doing?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, we knew kind of when we were teeing off.   There's big leaderboards all the way around the golf course.   It's not like you cannot look at them, because they're so massive that you kind of have to look at them. 
But I looked a little bit. 

Q.   A five stroke lead, obviously a hard thing, but chasing him for tomorrow, I mean, a five shot lead is not that big around this place, is it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No.   History will show that it all, it's all up to him.   I mean, if he plays really well it's going to be very hard to catch him.   But anything can happen around here and tomorrow just need to go out and shoot a good score.
