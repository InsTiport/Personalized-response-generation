Q.   Thoughts on this afternoon? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Got off to a good start.   Made a couple birdies early.   Just didn't drive it very well.   If you don't‑‑ for me, if I drive it straight out here, I'm going to play really well.   Hit a couple bad drives that cost me some shots and I missed a couple short putts, too.   But other than that, it wasn't too bad.   It was windy out there.   It was playing pretty tricky.   But yeah, I just‑‑ poor tee balls.

Q.   Do you think you can recover from this tomorrow?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I should be all right tomorrow.   We'll get out‑‑ we'll be out early and hopefully can shoot a good score and get back in the tournament. 

Q.   Last year, the par 5s seemed to be a big key to winning this tournament.   This year, the par 5s are proving to be a little more difficult‑‑
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, you've just got to take advantage of the par 5s.   I can reach all of them with irons.   I've got to birdie all the par 5s.   It's just one of those things, where especially on this golf course, you don't get a lot of good, close birdie opportunities, so take advantage of the par 5s and a few short holes, and today I just didn't do that.   I didn't take advantage of the par 5s.   I made bogey on 10.   I doubled the other short one, just bad, bad golf today.   But it's all right.   I'm still right there.   Got to play good tomorrow and we'll be all right. 

Q.   And the greens?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   The greens are good.   They are firm and fast‑‑ the greens are perfect.   They are firm and fast, and they are tricky, though.   I enjoy it.   They are fun to play.
