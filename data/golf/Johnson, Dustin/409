 Q.   Two doubles, how is the taste in the mouth after the two doubles?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, after 10, I wasn't too disappointed.   But obviously the double on the last hole hurt a little bit.   You know, just blocked a drive off the tee and obviously‑‑ I hit a good bunker shot, too, my pitch shot.   Just miss‑read the putt a little bit.  
.   But overall, I played really good again today.   6‑under, if you would have told me I would shoot 6‑under before teeing off today, I'd have taken it.   Obviously left a few shots out there.  
   
 Q.   What a golf course for you, you're just drilling it off the tee; Bubba Watson one of the longest in the world and you're smoking it by him.   What is it about the course for you?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It sets up well for me and I can hit a lot of drivers and it sets up to my eye and I like it.   I drove it really well again today, other than the last drive on 18.   
But besides that, I hit a lot of great shots, hit a lot of good putts, and still got to just come out tomorrow and do the same thing I did today.   
   
 Q.   There are no hackers in the field, we know that; how do you keep the chasing pack at bay?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Obviously there's good scores out there, so just got to come out tomorrow and do the same thing.   Just drive it in the fairway, hit some greens and roll in the putts.   
   
 Q.   If I gave you 67 tomorrow right now, would you take it?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I'd probably take it.   I don't know, hopefully I feel a little better tomorrow.
