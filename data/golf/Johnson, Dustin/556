 Q. Just talk about the day. I think 1-under to finish. Talk about the round and the conditions out there. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: The conditions are tough. I mean, the greens are really firm, so it's real hard to get it close to the flag. I hit a lot of good shots today, just had a lot of 20, 25 footers. I hit a lot of good putts, just couldn't really -- I made a couple putts, just no putts too long. 

 Q. Overall being in the TOUR Championship and being in the field this week and what it's been like being in the Playoffs as a whole. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, I've had a great run through the Playoffs, and I had a good year, too, coming up to it. You know, it's been great. You know you had a good year if you make it here.

 Q. Any pivotal shots in the round or any moments that maybe helped the round at all? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I started off good. I birdied No. 1, made a real good putt on 1. I hit two good shots in there, just got behind the hole. Getting behind the hole on these greens, you can have some funky putts.

 Q. With the fairways being as wet as they are, is that something that favors your game being one of the longer guys out here?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, you know, it's real key. You've got to hit some fairways here. If you don't hit the fairways, you definitely can't get it close to the flag. Hitting the fairways here is a big event. I drove it straight today.
