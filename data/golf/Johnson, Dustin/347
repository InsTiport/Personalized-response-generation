Q. It was important to get as many holes completed as possible, wasn't it?DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, we needed to play.  We wanted -- the more we get done, the easier it is for the return.Q. Tomorrow you've got a 7:00 restart, still a few holes to play.  Still in position?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I feel great.  I'm in a good spot.  Definitely got very tricky this afternoon, all day.  Even the front side the wind was howling and it was blowing straight left to right pretty much.  It played very tough all day.Q. Long day for you, too, wasn't it?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, long day.  Go and get a good night's rest and get back out here tomorrow. (Marked his ball, lying 2, in front of the 14th green)
