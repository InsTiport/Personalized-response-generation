Q. DJ, a turnaround, less than half an hour you're back out there. We just asked Dylan Frittelli, biggest advantage or disadvantage of this turnaround? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, it is nice. I feel like I'm on a good roll here. I'm feeling with the with the golf swing. To continue to play is definitely a nice advantage. Obviously we know how the golf course is playing. We've already played nine holes this morning, and just to turn around and go right back out I think is an advantage, and we're going to finish our round today, so yeah, I definitely think it is an advantage.
