Q. Dustin, sum up your day for us.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was okay.  Felt like I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in the hole, just burning the edges.  A few lip-outs.
But, I mean, it's this golf course.  It's tough to make putts on it.  I'm still feeling good about where I'm at.  A lot of golf to go.  Golf swing feels good.  So I'm happy with where I'm at.
Q. You gave yourself, obviously, great looks.  I watched a bunch of holes lip out.  At least you can take the positive that you gave yourself those birdie looks, right?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm giving myself opportunities.  Feel like I'm hitting my putts on my line with the correct speed.  So, I mean, at some point, they will start to go in.  Hopefully, that's tomorrow.
Q. Are you happy that you're going to be coming out early tomorrow, give yourself a break for now, or would you rather finish?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'd rather finish.  We have to come out, be in position at 7:00.  It's a short night and who knows what time we'll tee off in the afternoon.
Q. How much of a difference does experience make going into a final round, especially when you're chasing guys that haven't been in that position before?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it can only help for sure.  I've been in the position before.  I know what to expect.  I know how to handle it.  So hopefully, the ball falls my way tomorrow.
Q. Do you want it to be as hard as it can possibly be?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm pretty sure it's going to be hard.
Q. Jason was just saying he wanted it to be really hard.  Maybe to the advantage of guys who are [indiscernible], maybe.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I would imagine it's going to be quite difficult Sunday.
Q. On 17, are you going to use your driver again?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know where the flag is.
Q. Okay.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: But when I get there, I'll decide.
