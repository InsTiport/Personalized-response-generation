Q.   Talk about this week.   I know today wasn't the finish you were hoping for, but all in all a good week, a lot of positive things. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I had a solid week, but today the pins were tucked, the greens were a little bit firmer, and I was just a little bit off, so I couldn't really get it close to the hole.   I hit some good shots, just wasn't hitting it close enough to the hole.   I rolled the putter really well, just nothing went in.   I made one bogey, and that was really‑‑ I made a bad swing on 8, but the wind kind of switched, too, and I just didn't get up‑and‑down.   But other than that I had looks all day, just nothing went in.

Q.   I see some real brilliance coming back into your game.   I don't see any way they can leave you off the Ryder Cup team.   What do you think?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I don't know, I've had a good past two weeks, so I think I've made my case pretty solid.   I guess I'll find out tonight.

Q.   Are you nervous?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   A little bit.   I really want to play on the team.   I really think that I can help the team, and it's something that I really enjoy doing, so hopefully Captain Love will pick me.

Q.   Did you talk to Tiger about it at all today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, not really.
