  DUSTIN JOHNSON: I slipped on the stairs and landed on my low back. It's just real tight. As I was making some swings on the range it was about 80 percent. And it's still just‑‑ it's just so tight, it just wouldn't let me‑‑ I couldn't get through a backswing. I couldn't make a good backswing. But every time right at impact it would just catch. So I just don't feel like there's any chance of me competing. It hurts.   
I was doing everything I could to try to play. Last night ice, heat, ice. I was up pretty much all night, trying to get it ready for today. I've been worked on all morning. And obviously I can make some swings, but I try and make my normal swing and I just don't feel like there's any chance I'd be able to compete.   
   
 Q. Where is the spot directly?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's the left lower back.   
   
 Q. When you left the range and you were thinking of trying, what changed from the range to the putting green?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean obviously I want to play, more than anything, just sitting there on the putting green, obviously I made a few swings over on the putting green.  
   
 Q. What happened.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Tatum was on the way home from day care. And it was pouring down rain, so I was going to go move the car, I was just wearing my socks. So I just slipped as I was going down the stairs. And landed‑‑ it actually would have been better if it had been the first set of stairs, because I probably would have slid right down it, but it was only three, so I landed right on the bottom, my left elbow is swollen and bruised. I landed on my left side.   
   
 Q. (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's tough. I'm playing probably the best golf of my career, and I look forward to this tournament every year. And to have a freak accident happen yesterday afternoon after I got back from the course, it's tough.   
   
 Q. What do they tell you about when you might be able to return?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Obviously heat. If it happened on Monday, I don't think we would have any issues but it happened Wednesday afternoon.  
   
 Q. I'm not tired at all. I just can't swing.
