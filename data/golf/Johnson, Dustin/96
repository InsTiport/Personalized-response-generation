 Q.  What happened out there today, was it maybe different from the first three days for you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Not really anything, I felt like I had a tough time judging the wind today for some reason.  It was kind of, I mean it was blowing but it was, it kept switching directions a lot.  Yeah, I felt like I hit a lot of good shots that didn't end up in good spots and just didn't feel like I played any different, didn't hole any putts and that's the difference in shooting a couple under and a couple over.   
 Q.  This is your first round without a birdie in nearly two years, even on a difficult course is that especially surprising?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean it's surprising, but, yeah, I hit good putts, they just didn't go in the hole.  I didn't feel like I played bad, felt like I was swinging well and I still feel like I'm swinging well, I still got a lot of confidence in the game but just, yeah, tough day, tough conditions, and didn't, wasn't spot on.
