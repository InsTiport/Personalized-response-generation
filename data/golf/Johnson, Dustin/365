Q.   (No Microphone.)
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, that always works. 

Q.   Talk about the round. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, I got off to a bad start.   I drove it right down the middle and then just hit a bad shot.   Hit it thin out of the middle of the fairway and over the green and made double from there.   Just bad start. 
But came back right on 2 there and hit two really good shots and made a great putt, made 3 there. 
I played really solid from the rest of the way in. 
8's always a‑‑ I was telling my brother, walking up the fairway, you know, just hardly ever hit that green in two.   But coming ‑‑ I hit it right down the middle there and then hit a 3‑iron and just couldn't hit it any better.   Hit it right on the perfect line.   I was just hoping it was the right distance.   When I got up there, obviously, it was pretty close to the hole and made another good putt there. 
15, that's always a tough second shot, but I hit a great shot in there to about a foot.   So, that's always a bonus there. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I mean, I was coming in here confident about my game.   I've been playing well all year.   This is a golf course that I really like to play.   I have fun out there. 
It's always challenging, but if you hit great shots, you can get it close to the hole and you can make a lot of birdies. 

Q.   Were you watching the leaderboards and how Jordan was playing? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I mean, we, I saw that he was playing really well and obviously the big leaderboards out there, you can see it.   So I knew he was at 14.   So, I'm just trying to get as many birdie looks as I can. 

Q.   Is that a lot of pressure when you go out when a guy's playing like that or do you just have to stay in your own game and have confidence in your abilities?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, we still got 36 holes left, so that's a lot of golf.   Anything can happen around here.   It's a fun golf course, it yields a lot of birdies or eagles, but you can make big numbers, too.   So you just never know.
