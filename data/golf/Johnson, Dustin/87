 Q.  When it's that difficult out there does it test your patience?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, a little bit.  Because you hit a few shots really close and you want to make them.  But around here the greens are tricky.  For me, I don't know, I've always struggled reading them.  But I hit some really nice putts and I played really solid.   
 Q.  Knowing what's ahead how nice is to be done and in the position you are going into the weekend?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm in a good position no matter what happens.  But it's definitely nice to be done.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was difficult all day.  The wind blew consistently all day.  Made it tough.  But I hit a lot of really solid golf shots.  At times it was really difficult to judge the wind but I felt like I played really solid all day, gave myself a lot of opportunities.   
 Q.  What's the key on a day like today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's all about controlling your golf ball and distance.   
 Q.  What was going through your mind when you heard that horn blow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, but luckily we could still play and finish the hole.  It's nice to get done, that's definitely a bonus.   
 Q.  How difficult was it playing in these conditions?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, the conditions were tough.  I felt like I played really well all day.  Drove it good again, hit a lot of really nice iron shots and rolled the putter well.  I didn't make as many putts -- I had a lot of good putts just didn't make a lot of them.   
 Q.  How much does the momentum carry over from Augusta and what do you want to do heading into the weekend?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just keep doing exactly what I've been doing.  I'm swinging well, placing the ball where I want to.  Hopefully I can roll in a few putts over the weekend.
