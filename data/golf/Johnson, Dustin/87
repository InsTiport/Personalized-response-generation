  DUSTIN JOHNSON: I felt like I played solid. I just couldn't‑‑ I just never could get it going. It was, you know, a few putts here and there to burn the edges. I felt like I struck it well. Drove it pretty well. But I just never got it going. 

Q. How do you attack tomorrow, chasing four or five back?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's going to be‑‑ the conditions are going to be tough. So I've got to put together a really good round. Obviously you never know what can happen around here, and there's a lot of holes where you can make an eagle or you can make a bogey. I'm going to have to go out and shoot a very good score, but it's definitely doable.
