 Q.  Obviously, a different day today, a little more difficult.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean -- well, it was -- I felt like I hit it pretty good.  Made one -- hit one really poor shot.  That was on 6, off the tee.   
But other than that, I thought I swung it pretty well.  It was tough this afternoon with the wind, I thought.  It was just all over the map, you know.  It never went one direction.   
 Q.  Looked like you got off to a good start, but --  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, hit some great shots, just didn't -- the only difference from today than yesterday is just didn't hole any putts.  It was pretty simple.  I was having a lot of great looks and didn't make anything.  I felt like I hit some pretty good putts.   
The only really bad one I hit, that I just shoved, was on 17.  After I hit a great wedge shot in there to try to save par, I just pushed that one a little bit.  But other than that, I felt like I hit some good putts.  Just nothing went in.   
 Q.  So is there an element of disappointment in there?  You're only three back.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  It's only Friday.  I shot 1 under.  It's not a great score out there today, but with not making any putts and hit a few loose shots here and there.  I felt like overall, though, I hit it pretty dang good.
