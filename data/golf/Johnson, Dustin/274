 Q.  You could be holding the trophy right now --  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I struggled on that hole a little bit.  I like the hole, too.  I don't know, just played it poorly this week.  Look, it has to do with the putter.  I just did not roll it that well.  Honestly I had a good finish.  But other than that, I didn't roll any putts.   
Like you said, I played really nicely.  I feel like I'm hitting the ball really well.  I'm really looking forward to going into next week.  I think the game is in really good shape.  Do a little practice on the putting in the next few days over at Baltusrol.  But other than that, I'm really confident in the game right now.  I feel like everything is going really well.   
 Q.  Have to ask you a question about what transpired on the 18th hole, because you've had some heartbreak in the game and now you've had triumphs, so you're familiar with seeing things like that.  What's going through your mind and can you relate to that situation at all?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's a tough break, because he didn't hit that -- he hit a pretty good second shot.  He missed it in the right spot.  It ended up in the bunker and where he was at -- it wasn't like he hit a terrible shot.  There was just no sand there.
