 Q.  Can you explain the situation on 4?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean obviously it was my fault.  I should have -- the Marshall had it marked, said it went in the hazard right there, so and there was a ball right there and it was a TaylorMade.  I could see the logo on the side, so I just, obviously, just assumed it was mine.  And it was way up in there, so I didn't want to move anything.  But I guess now understanding the new rule, I still, I got to identify, if it moves it's not a penalty.  So that won't ever happen again.  I can promise you that.  But, yeah, it's just bad luck.   
 Q.  What was the ball -- when you went down, what was the thing that made you realize it wasn't yours?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, when I walked up 20 yards, and I saw my ball.  That's what made me realize it wasn't mine.   
 Q.  Did you ever hit the wrong ball on a hole before?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  And I won't ever do it again.   
 Q.  Did you say anything to the Marshall?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it's not his fault.  No.  Just kind of went on about my day.  Hopefully it gets better and it didn't, so.
