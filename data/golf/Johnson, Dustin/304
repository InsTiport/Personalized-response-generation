 Q.  Dustin, another really strong performance tee to green.  2-under, 68.  Not bad but I know you would have felt there's a lot more out there.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I felt like I played really well tee to green.  Just hit a lot of good putts, just nothing went in the hole.  I felt like I was just burning the edges all day.   
 Q.  That's the thing, it doesn't look like you're reading -- they're starting off wrong or got to find something.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  They're not going in.  I feel like I'm hitting pretty good putts.  Just, you know, I don't know.  I'll go work on it again.  But I don't feel like I'm off.  You know, I'm not like going and pushing.  Just not going in the hole.   
 Q.  Which is only the difference between you and leading by that 4 or 5.  Do you feel tee to green you got to measure this golf course by a long way?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm playing really solid.  All year I felt like I hit it pretty well from tee to green.  Just need to roll in a few more putts.   
 Q.  You've given yourself a chance this week.  Good luck with that.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Thank you.
