Q. After today you have a chance to be a champion again.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I played very well today.  I thought I never really got in trouble.  I hit it pretty well today.  I really like this golf course.  I feel comfortable out here.  I think I'm swinging very well.  So tomorrow, just need to go out and have a good day.
Q. Today was bogey-free.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, that would be nice, go out and do that tomorrow.  You never know what will happen.
Q. A great round today.  How did it feel out there?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It felt good.  I felt like I hit the ball well.  Missed a few shots here and there, but never really got in trouble and when I did, I was able to get up-and-down.
Today I felt like I rolled the putter really nicely and drove it well, too, all day.  The conditions, got a little windy out there.  The wind was shifting around, too, probably starting last bit of the front nine and the whole back nine.
The golf course is in great shape.  It's soft, so you know, if you're driving it in the fairway, you can take advantage of the golf course.
Q. Looking at your scores, do you feel like you needed a few rounds to kind of settle into this tournament?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, other than yesterday, I struggled a little bit yesterday.  That was it.  I felt like I played really well the first day and I played really well today.
Tomorrow I just need to go out and keep doing what I'm doing, drive it in the fairway and get looks at birdies.
Q. You put yourself in contention.  Must feel great.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it always feels good to be in contention.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. How does it feel to get yourself up there going into the final day?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's always great to be up there and feel like you have a chance on Sunday.  You don't know how many back you'll be or what will happen the last few holes with the guys behind, but I'll definitely have a chance to win tomorrow, and you know, that's kind of all you can ask for.  Two years ago here, I had a three-shot lead on Sunday and tomorrow, I'm probably going to be a couple behind.
But tomorrow, just need to go out and do what I did today.  Just drive it in the fairway and get a lot of looks at birdies.
Q. The other days have been pretty good but presumably today was better and things just clicked a bit more?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I played really well the first day and really well today.  Yesterday I just struggled a bit kind of with everything.  But finished my round really nicely yesterday.  I birdied 16, 17, 18 and so that kind of rolled over to today, had a little momentum.
I'm feeling really good about the game.  Just got to go out and do it tomorrow.
Q. I presume you're feeling pretty good at this place.  We saw you had the success two years ago, missed you last year, but one of those favourite places, is it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I like it here.  I really do.  The golf course is great.  It's in great shape and it's a lot of fun to play.
Q. You seem to have a nice attitude with the Chinese fans, as well?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: They were great.  A lot of fans out there and they have been really good this week.
Q. Do you thrive on that, do you thrive on that kind of support?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's always good to have a lot of support out there.
