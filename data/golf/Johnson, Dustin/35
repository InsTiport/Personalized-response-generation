Q. General thoughts on the round?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, overall, it was good.  I drove it in the fairway, which is what I wanted to do today.  Put the ball in the fairway, because obviously from the fairway, you can attack the golf course, and I'm swinging really well with the irons.  I'm really comfortable throughout the whole bag with the irons.
I gave myself a lot of good looks at birdie, and you know, it was nice to roll in those last two putts for sure.
Q. How will you approach tomorrow, knowing five-shot lead, I think?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Obviously I'm in a great position and like where I'm at, but I'm still going to have to go out and shoot a good score.  You can go low out here and guys are going low every day, especially with the conditions we have:  Perfect greens, golf course is in great shape and not a lot of wind.
Obviously guys are going to shoot pretty low.  So I still need to go out and play a good round.
Q. When you left here yesterday, and you checked your phone for the first time, what were the text messages like?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   They were all good.  Good playing.  I mean, it was fun to watch.  Obviously being 11-under through 11, it was fun for me.  I would imagine it's pretty fun to watch, too.
Q. Is that the best you've ever played?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yesterday, yeah, through the first 11 holes, absolutely.  On the way in, not so much, but you know, I still hit some really good shots and had some good looks to shoot 59 but didn't hit in the fairway enough.
Q. What did you hit on 18?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Driver.  With the rain and everything, softened up, and it was a little into the wind.  5-iron.
Q. You took three months off obviously just like everyone else did, but why do you think you've been swinging it so well this summer?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I've been working at it pretty hard the last few weeks.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.   I didn't do much practicing over the break, but my swing, it doesn't tend to get too far off.  Just sometimes getting it back on track takes a little bit of time.
Yeah, I've been working hard at it and putting in a lot of good practice, good quality practice, and you know, feel good over the ball right now.
Q. What have you been working on?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Hitting a cut.
Q. Can you just talk about closing out the round with an eagle?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, obviously I did what I wanted to.  Drove it in the fairway and knocked it on the green and obviously making that putt is a bonus, so it was a pretty tough putt up and over a ridge and breaking a lot.  But had perfect speed on it and it went in.
Q. Talk to Scotty at all about his 59?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I just told him nice playing.
Q. You've been in good position over the years going into Atlanta and just missed out a few times on the FedExCup.  Where does that rank on your goals, and how focused are you on doing it this year?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   The FedExCup is something I have not won and I would like to win.  It's definitely something on my list of goals to accomplish.  I would like to be a FedExCup Champion.  So obviously, you know, these next couple weeks are jockeying for good position for going into East Lake, and hopefully I can better my number and get up there in a good position so I can have a chance to win it.
