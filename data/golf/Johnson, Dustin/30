  Q. Dustin, just talk about that amazing finish, especially the 18th hole in regulation, holing that massive putt.
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, obviously I knew I needed to make birdie to get into the playoff.  But yeah, I played an unbelievable putt, got in the playoff and then Jon made an even more ridiculous putt on top of me, and then I gave it a good effort.  I thought I made it when it was coming down the hill.  It just kind of ran out of a little bit of speed and missed just low.
 Q. Some thoughts on heading into next week at East Lake, you're No. 1 so you'll have a two-shot lead going in.  Just some thoughts on that?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, obviously the goal was to be No. 1 going into East Lake, and I am still No. 1.  Yeah, I mean, I like my position.  I feel like the game is in really good form right now.  I'm really, really pleased with all aspects of the game.  I'm really looking forward to next week and a chance to win the FedExCup.
 Q. Through the middle stretch of the last round, 8 and 10, made a couple bogeys.  What were your thoughts at that point?  Did you feel comfortable trying to get back into the mix?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I did.  This golf course is hard.  You're going to make -- if you get out of position, it's real easy to make a bogey, and that's what I did on 8 and 10.  Other than that, I thought I played really solid all day long, and you know, shot a good score.  67 around here is a pretty solid number.  Got into the playoff, but obviously Jon holed that really nice putt to beat me.
 Q. You're a pretty laid-back guy.  You seem to handle victories and disappointments in the same manner.  You showed a lot of emotion on that putt in regulation.  What's the feeling now?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, I was just laughing kind of.  I was kind of laughing at my putt, too, because it was one of those where you -- you're not really thinking you're going to make it.  But gave it a good roll, and obviously I did make it.  Yeah, he came right back and made one on top of me in the playoff.
