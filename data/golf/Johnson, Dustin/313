 Q.  That was an incredible match.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was a tough match.  We both got off to a great start birdieing the first two holes and it never really let up from there.  It was a lot of birdies.  When I made the turn I played really well.  He played really well, too, it was a tough match.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I made a really nice putt and then made a bomb, which was nice.  You get them on line, they go in.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: He made one from off the green, a little outside of where I was and then I had a 15-footer on top of him.  That was a huge putt.   
 Q.  First time you made it to quarterfinals, good feeling?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I feel like I'm swinging really.  I like this golf course, it sets up really well for me.  So you never know what will happen.
