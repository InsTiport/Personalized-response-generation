 Q.  A little easier?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Today was much easier than it has been in the past, yes.   
 Q.  Which past are we talking about?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: The past few months.  You know, well, today was the first time it's kind of felt, the golf swing, I was in control, like I was leading into the Masters.   
I've been saying it's close and I've seen signs of it, but today was the first day where I felt like all day, I was really in control of the swing.  Hit a lot of really good shots.  Drove it well.  Did everything really well.  It's the first time in a long time I've done that.   
 Q.  Can you talk about what prompted the putter change?  Is there a comfort level you felt?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I wasn't that comfortable to be honest with the putter, just because it's a new putter and I haven't putted with it.  Especially after the second hole when I hit it about 15 feet past and 3-putted, I'm like, oh, great, what have I done.   
But I knew I've been rolling it well.  Practicing the last couple days with it.  I wasn't too worried about it.  But you know, speed was my biggest concern, just because I haven't been using that style of putter.   
But the rest of the day my speed was really good.  I was hitting the ball where I wanted to.  Just I got a little bit more feel with the putter, instead of the Spider I was using, I was getting a little bit too mechanical and a little bit too -- I was worrying about too many things when I was putting instead of just putting.   
So that's why I went back.  It's the same putter I've putted with forever.  It's just a copy of it.  TaylorMade prototype.   
 Q.  What's it do for your day, just to birdie 18?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, obviously birdieing 18 is always good.  I was playing solid.  It was nice to hit a good shot in there but I didn't have the easiest putt, even though it was only, whatever, four feet or something.  It was straight down the hill, sliding a little right, but I hit a nice putt right in left center.   
 Q.  Do you wish you had changed putters earlier?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  The way I've been playing had nothing to do with the putting.  I wish I could blame it on something but it wasn't that.  I just wasn't swinging that well.  I didn't have a lot of confidence in the golf swing, and so you know, I was just a little bit off.  I was just out of rhythm.   
Today I felt like I had really good rhythm with the golf swing all day, and for me, if my rhythm is really good, I'm going to hit it pretty nicely.   
 Q.  Did you find yourself at all from the British through the PGA, almost forcing it, trying too hard, feeling you were close and wanting to get there faster?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah, I wanted to get the golf game back in order.  Like I said, there were signs of it.  It just wasn't consistent.   
You know, I played a little better on Sunday at Charlotte.  Actually I thought I played pretty decent every day in Charlotte with the golf swing.  It was pretty good.  It wasn't great but it was pretty good.  I just didn't putt it that well at Charlotte.  That was kind of what prompted the switch.   
 Q.  Do you realize that a lot of players, they use the same putter as you when you won?  Right now, are they going to --  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I have no idea what they are going to do.   
 Q.  How much did the Bahamas do you good?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: A lot of good.  It was nice.   
 Q.  You've been grinding pretty hard.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I've been practicing hard.   
 Q.  Is a week off better than a week working?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, for me it is.  It was very nice.  I mean, I needed a break, just mentally, physically, just to get away, enjoy some time with Paulina and some friends.  Did a lot of diving, spearfishing.  Had a great week.   
 Q.  The rhythm with the thing, how do you get that back?  Did something click or is it just a timing issue?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I don't know, it just -- it just comes with time I guess.  I don't know.  I think the week off put me back in my rhythm honestly.  I really don't know.   
But I just know, I just slowed the backswing down a little bit and it made all the difference.   
 Q.  What did you shoot?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: What?   
 Q.  What did you shoot?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Today?   
 Q.  No.  Last week.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I didn't play.   
 Q.  Spear.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Oh, a bunch of fish.  (Laughter) what did I shoot -- I didn't shoot any golf, that's for sure.  Shot some fish, though.   
 Q.  A lot of guys are talking about heading into the off-season; do you, after one week doing you that much good, how much do you look forward to the off-season?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I look forward to my off-season every year.  But I play a schedule that's pretty -- where I get some breaks just so I don't get worn out or burnt out or mentally frustrated or things like that.   
I've kind of learned over the years, you know, what works for me, and just stick with it.  It seems to be doing okay.  But yeah, I always look forward to the off-season, just some downtime to train and not really worry about playing golf that much.  So I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  You said yesterday that you really liked this course.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: The golf course, it's in fantastic condition.  It suits my eye well.  If I keep hitting it like I'm hitting it, I'm going to like it a lot more come Sunday, that's for sure.
