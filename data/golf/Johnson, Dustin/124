DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit a lot of fairways, I didn't count, but no like really bad tee shots.
Q. Was it something you found on the range yesterday afternoon or this morning?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I felt a little better today, but even yesterday, I felt like I hit my irons really well.  Yeah, today, the driver was closer.  Still wasn't great, but I felt like I swung it a little bit better.  I kept it, you know, in between the trees, at least.  Kept it in play.
But you know, other than that, I felt like I hit the ball very well.  I hit a lot of great iron shots.  Rolled the putter good, and other than the first hole, it was a really good day.
Q. Are you impressed you're at 8-under that you had two triples or just that you had two triples?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Both.
Q. What do you take from that?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Probably that I'm at 8-under with two triples.  I mean, I think that's probably the third triple I made all year, and then today I made a triple on probably the easiest hole on the golf course with no penalty shot.
Yeah, that was not a fun start -- well, I was laughing because I couldn't believe I just made a seven on that hole.  Yeah, it was funny.  There was nothing to do but laugh at that point.
Q. Do you and Brooks bring out the best in each other?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I just think we're both playing good golf right now.  I mean, you look at us, all three of us, J.T. included, it's the end of the year.  We're coming off a big stretch where we've all been playing well.
Yeah, I think all three of us are playing some good golf.
