 Q.  Impressive on the last four holes.  Talk about the comeback there at the end.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I definitely was struggling a little bit, but I didn't feel like I was playing bad.  Just didn't -- missed some short putts and then hit a couple bad drives that cost me the three shots is the reason I was 3-over.  But yeah, just tried to hang in there.  I knew, talking with A.J. there on the back nine, I was trying to get it back to even.  I knew if I could get it back to even that I'm not out of the golf tournament by any means, especially not around here.   
Obviously getting it back to 1-under was a really good finish, making a 3 there on 18.  Yeah, I just started hitting it a little better, holed those two putts there on 17 and 18, which obviously gives me a lot of momentum going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  Is the eagle kind of a surprise there a little bit on the last?  You hit two good shots.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I drove it in the fairway, which is the first part, and then I had a really good number.  I was trying to -- I knew through the green wouldn't be bad, so I went ahead and hit 4-iron and I hit it hard, and it came out really nice and hit right in the upslope, so it stopped, and yeah, obviously getting an eagle there to that flag is definitely a bonus.
