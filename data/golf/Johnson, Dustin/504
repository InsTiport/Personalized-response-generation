 Q. As well as you've been driving it all week, are you surprised you didn't get the score a little lower?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was a little bit of a struggle on the greens today, just didn't hole any putts, didn't really make anything. I'm driving it well, swinging good at it. Hit a lot of good iron shots, just really struggling to get it in the hole.

 Q. Are you just not comfortable over putts at this point? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm just not feeling it with the putter. I'm doing everything I can to get it as close as I can to I can make putts, but they're just not going in.

 Q. I mean, you seemed to get something a little bit yesterday and then just lost it overnight essentially? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, it's just tough. The greens out here are tough. You know, when my speed -- my speed wasn't all that great today with the short putts. I hit a few -- just hit a few too hard, hit them through the break. But I'm going to go work on the speed and work on some short ones and maybe come out here tomorrow and post a good number.

 Q. Do you go into tomorrow and try to enjoy your Sunday at Augusta?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I mean, I've got to shoot a good score. I can still -- if I played really good tomorrow I can maybe squeak a top 10 or top 5 out of it if I play real good golf. But I'm going to have to play really well. I just have to hole putts. That's all it is. I'm swinging really good, really confident in the golf swing, hitting a lot of good shots. But golf is all about getting it in the hole as fast as you can.

 Q. You watched Adam move up the leaderboard. What was the difference in his game today from the past two days you played with him?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: He holed putts today. He made a lot of key putts. Made a few long ones. I mean, longest putt I think I made was about six feet. Not doing so well. 

 Q. On No. 2, what happened there with the ruling on the drop?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was just embedded in a hole, so I got relief.
