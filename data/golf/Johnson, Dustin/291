 Q.  Mr. Johnson, with everything that has come down in major championships for you, even this came down to a test of your nerves.  How did you keep your composure down the back nine?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I just -- you know, just focusing on -- I knew I was swinging well, and I just kept thinking, it's just me and the course.  I'm playing against the course.  I can't control what anyone else does.   
So just tried to hit golf shots, tried to hit it on the correct side of the hole, and two-putt.   
 Q.  17, you went in the bunker, you got out, and you made what proved to be a very important par.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, no, par putt.  Yeah, that was a huge putt.  I made an even bigger putt on 16 for par.  Hit a great shot, thought it was just perfect, and ended up just going through the green.  Chipped a little bit by the hole, but saw I left myself with an uphill putt.  I was fortunate enough I rolled it in.   
 Q.  And at 18, you all but jarred it from the fairway.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, no, I mean, I hit two great shots on 18.  It might be one of the best shots I ever hit.  So that was very nice to have a short putt like that to get it in the house.   
 Q.  Last question.  Your feelings now that you have a major in your pocket?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Feels good.  Feels really good.  Feels well deserved.  I've had a lot of opportunities that I didn't quite get it done.  So this one's definitely really sweet.   
 Q.  And to have your family there?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It means the world.  It's Father's Day.  My birthday's in a couple days.  Couldn't have came at a better time.
