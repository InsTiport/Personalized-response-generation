   DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just didn't really hole any putts. You know, hopefully tomorrow come out and shoot a good score.  
  
  Q. What do you think is the main reason for the maybe not kicking on so early in this? There's a lot of birdies to be made out there.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, there is. I just didn't swing that well today. I hit some good shots and made some birdies, but I just didn't hit it as well as I would like to.   
 But you know come out tomorrow and play good and shoot a good score. But I'm playing -- if this is the worst round I have, I'll be all right.  
  
  Q. Playing with Martin Kaymer, a lot of crowds following you, mainly cheering for him, a good atmosphere out there?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, they are nice fans. They were cheering for all of us, so it was nice.   
  
  Q. Do you see a big difference in general tournament-wise playing the US PGA TOUR and now being here in Europe, course layout, maintenance-wise?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: They are pretty similar. This course is very well manicured. The greens are good. The fairways are good. So the course conditions are fantastic.   
  
  Q. Your game seems to be actually quite in shape, especially the last weekend was quite good. How do you feel for the next three rounds to come?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel good. Yesterday I played really nice. So today just a little bit of a struggle, but you know, work on a few things and then come out tomorrow and play good.
