  Q. A couple of birdies on the par 5s, imagine a little frustrated?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, especially that I drove.  
  
  Q. A round of 1-under par, no birdies on the par 5s, I would imagine a little bit frustrated?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, just a little bit, especially I drove it in the fairway. But I'll have to go out tomorrow and hopefully post a good score.  
  
  Q. How was it playing with brother? How much fun is he having and how much fun are you having playing with him?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: We had a good time playing with my brother and Rory and his dad. Weather was gorgeous, Scottish weather -- we had a great time.   
  
  Q. Got to ask you about losing your caddie, Joe LaCava, to Tiger Woods, how disappointed about that?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Things happen. He's got to do what he's got to do, so I'll be all right. I'll find me a caddie.  
  
  Q. Was it true you only found out walking the last green?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, in the locker room after THE TOUR Championship.  
  
  Q. Did Tiger contact you at all and ask if he could approach him?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I did, I talked to Tiger. Everything's all good. No hard feelings at all. So I've got some -- for this year and I'll find a caddie for next year.
