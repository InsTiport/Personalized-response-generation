  Q. Which would you prefer to see, conditions like this where you can go low or would you prefer the howling wind tomorrow?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: It doesn't matter. You know, it's still 18 holes of golf, no matter what the conditions are. You're going to have to play really well tomorrow if you want to take home the trophy. Really doesn't matter.   
  
  Q. Will you be aggressive?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, it depends on the wind, but there's not really too many places you can be too aggressive. But you've got to drive it straight. If you drive it in the fairway, you're going to have a lot of opportunities to maybe get some balls close to the hole and make some birdies.   
  
  Q. Talk about Pete Dye and how you're able to take everything that's happened around you on the golf course with regards to all of the golfers and concentrate when you get on the tee box --  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, the golf course is intimidating off the tee visually. When you get out there, you realize, you know, you've got some room to maneuver the ball and get it in the fairway. So as long as you hit the right shapes off the tee, then, you know, the ball fits in there nicely.  
  
  Q. Any change in your game plan being a few strokes behind as opposed to being ahead?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No. You know, I've stuck to my game plan all week. I'm playing well. You know, I finally started swinging the ball really well today. I drove it straight and hit some good iron shots.   
 Tomorrow I'm going to have to go out and be aggressive early and maybe roll a couple putts early.
