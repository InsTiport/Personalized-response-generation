 Q.  (No Microphone.)  DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know, I figure it's right on the border right now.  I would have liked to have holed that putt on the last hole.   Q.  It looked like your misses were right, what was going on?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I just didn't drive it well with the driver.  I missed them all to the right. But, I don't know, new driver.  I mean, it's really good when I hit it well, but today I was just a little bit off. But I still played pretty well, I had a lots of putts that could have gone in, but didn't.  But I hung in there and fought and fought pretty hard.  I would have liked to have birdied that last hole.   Q.  How would you assess where your play is two rounds into your season?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's really close to being good.  I think that the last two days I think have normally I probably would be at least 5- or 6-under right now instead of even par but, I'm happy with where it's at, just a little rusty, that's all.   Q.  What's the difference between your game when you shot the 61, 63, 61 at Sherwood and right now?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just driving it.  Obviously you play that well, you're driving it well and putting well.  So I thought I rolled the putter very well, just it wasn't going in, just had a lot of lipouts.  And I didn't drive it in the fairway enough.   Q.  I think a lot of people were surprised to hear that you get stressed about things.  When you talk about how you're dealing with your stress, do you think you just hide it well?  Most people look at you as laid back.  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Sure, that's the whole point, I think.  I definitely do.   Q.  So what do you do now that you're back out of that sort of environment to not fall back into those habits?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Go to the gym a lot.  Do things that are fun.   Q.  (No Microphone.)  DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, he's not here this week, he's at home.   Q.  Did you notice that you had a lot of guys with babies in your gallery?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, there was a few.   Q.  What do you make of that?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it's great.  But I wish they could be out here, but he's only almost three weeks old, so it's a little too early.
