DUSTIN JOHNSON: I missed quite a few shorts one there from 18 to 5.  But if I keep giving myself chances, I feel like I'm rolling the putter well, just a couple misreads.  And the greens are tricky.  They're hard to read.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible) birdie 15, 16, 17?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Oh, yeah, any -- those, 15, 16, 17 are three really tough holes.  But, you know, this golf course, if you drive it in the fairway, for me, if I drive it in the fairway, I can attack pretty much every hole.  So that was the key there, just hit it in the fairway.   
 Q.  These greens (indiscernible)?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, they're very subtle and you you're trying read break, and I missed a lot of putts just playing too much break.  But then you do that, and then you go and you play one, you don't play enough breaks.  So it's they're hard to read.  And I felt like I'm hitting good putts, so I need to keep doing that.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's 72 holes of golf, so I got a long way to go.  But, yeah, teeing off yesterday, obviously that was a very, very spectacular round.  But I wasn't worried about the 7-under I was just trying to shoot as low as I could.   
 Q.  You have five birdies (indiscernible) bogey, thinking that you might be in the range (indiscernible)?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I wasn't thinking anything other than the next shot I had to hit.  So, but, yeah, I mean, you can get it going out here.  For me, if I can drive it in the fairways, I can get it going.  Just need to roll the putter.   
 Q.  This week emotionally (indiscernible) how did you deal with that?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I feel good.  I feel like the golf game is in good form.  I'm definitely looking forward to a good weekend.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible) can you describe the nature of (indiscernible)?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, we're very competitive on the golf course, in the gym, whatever it is.  We're really good friends.  We kind of push each other.  So it's been a lot of fun.   
 Q.  How do you feel where you are in this tournament and your chances?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, the afternoon guys still got 18 holes to play.  I feel like I'm in a good position.  I'm happy with where I'm at no matter what the lead is after today.  I'm going to be somewhere around it or close enough to where with 36 holes left, I'm okay.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I hope we are.  It would be a lot of fun.
