 Q.  I think you teed off at 12:48 and by 2 o'clock you were 3-up in your match.  You dictated the match from there on in.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I got off to a good start, birdied 1 and 2.  Hit a nice shot in there on 3.  I had to two-putt there.  I played really solid all day.  Seven or eight birdies, no bogeys, so that was pretty solid playing in these conditions.   
 Q.  Is it an advantage to close out this match early?  Do you save energy or mental fatigue by doing this?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't think it really matters.  It's day one.  It's definitely nice to get a victory.  Last year I think I lost in the first round.  It's nice to get off to a good start.  I feel like I'm playing really well.  I'm looking forward to a rest of the week.   
 Q.  Pretty stress free win, 5 and 3 over Webb Simpson.  How do you assess your game?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I played really well today.  I played solid.  Made seven or eight birdies.  No bogeys.  Webb played well, too.  I was just playing really solid.   
 Q.  Now you've got to get through three matches and all that to get to the Sweet 16.  You were the only guy that lost in the first round last year that got to the Sweet 16.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know about that, but I know I did lose in the first round and I made it through.  I had to go in a playoff with Aphibarnrat.  I beat him in a playoff and made it through.  But hopefully this year I won't have to do that.
