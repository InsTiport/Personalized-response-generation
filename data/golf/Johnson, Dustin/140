 Q.  DJ, that was a grindy sort of today.  Your thoughts on today, the first round?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: There was some really good stuff and some not so good stuff.  I played well.  Missed a couple short putts early in the round, had a couple three-putts on the back nine.  But you know, I did some good stuff.  I hit a lot of really good shots.  I drove it okay.  The couple drives that just went in the rough or just in the first cut made it kind of difficult to control the ball coming into the greens, but all in all, it was a pretty good day, just a few loose shots here, and it seemed like every time I was out of position, I made bogey.  But I made a bunch of birdies and an eagle.   
 Q.  Looked like you guys were struggling a little bit with reading wind direction at times.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I had a tough time with the wind today.  I'd play it in off the left and it would be down off the left.  And here the greens are kind of small, so that five or six-yard difference or however much it is, 10-yard difference, makes a big deal if you hit it in the wrong spot around these greens.   
 Q.  A little bit of everything out there today, particularly on your opening nine, but kind of righted the ship there.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was good.  I got off to kind of a tough -- I missed a short putt on the first hole was all it was, and missed quite a few really good looks at birdie out there, especially on my first nine holes, first ten holes, really.  I made some nice putts there on my back nine, and I'm swinging the club very, very well.  I've just got to get it in the fairway.  Every time I hit the fairway, I hit it inside 10 feet.  I just need to hit the fairway.  I hit quite a few good drives, a few good drives, but a few that were just off or just in the rough, and it makes it difficult.   
 Q.  How big of a challenge is it coming from last week at the Open Championship at Carnoustie and coming here, very firm golf course there, kind of a soft golf course here.  I know you were working on your driver earlier this week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's still golf.  You're playing numbers.  No matter where you're playing at, you're still trying to fly it a certain number.  So for me, it's not a -- it's really not much -- obviously you play it very different than here, but golf is still the same.  You've still got to hit good shots, and you've still got to fly it the right number.
