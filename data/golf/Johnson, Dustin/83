 Q.  Dustin Johnson, usually you have three weeks on coming into the PGA Championship.  You've had three weeks off coming into this week, 1-under par.  Are you pleased with this first-round performance?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm very pleased with it.  I felt like I hit it really well, drove it good and hit a lot of greens, gave myself a lot of opportunities.  I felt like I hit a lot of good putts that a few of them could have gone in that didn't, but I'm very happy with the way I played and the opportunities I gave myself.   
 Q.  You said earlier in the week you've been working really hard on your wedge play, and you know, that and your driver is going to be key this week.  So those two categories, is there anything you can improve on for the rest of the week, or are you happy where that stands?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I drove it pretty well today, so I'm very pleased with the driving.  You know, make a few more putts, that's about it.  But you can always make more putts.  But yeah, I'm happy with the way I swung the golf club today, and I felt like I could control the ball very well, and you know, this is just a hard golf course.  It's hard to get it close to the hole, and a lot of these holes it's hard to hit the fairway.  I just need to do a little bit more of that tomorrow, hit it in the fairway and just give myself opportunities.
