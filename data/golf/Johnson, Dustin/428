 Q.   Dustin, if you figure out the 9th, you'd be in.   Back to back days, that gets you.   Can't take away from a good start.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm so right there.   Two more days.   And, you know, I played okay today.   Didn't play as well as I did yesterday, but, you know, still got to hole a few more putts and, yeah, 9 is just a tough hole.   
You know, but other than that, it was a pretty good day.   Had a lot of good looks.   Couldn't get anything in the hole.  
   
 Q.   You're striking it well.   Your iron play looked good through two days.   When you missed the greens, it's been a challenge to get it up and down.   
How much has the layoff hurt that?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It has nothing to do with that.   Around here, when you miss the green, you know, it's hit or miss whether the lie you got is any good.   You know, I just had a few times where I missed the green and had bad lies and it's just tough to judge the chip shots.  
   
 Q.   You know how hard it is to score on this golf course.   Outside of one guy who is kind running out in front right now, it's a really bunched leaderboard.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's going to be a good weekend no matter what.   Even the guys out front.   Obviously, if he has another two days like the first two, it will be tough to catch him, but I would say I look forward to being bunched throughout on Sunday coming down the stretch.  
   
 Q.   Fans love to see you up there.  
AThank you.  
   
 Q.   Harris English is having a good day today.   Talk about where you are as you position yourself for the weekend.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Anything under par is good around here.   I need to have a good day tomorrow.   I played pretty solid today.   I need to get some more putts in the hole.   I'm happy where I'm at.   I played pretty well the last two days.   Just this golf course is tough, it's tough to score on.  
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about -- I know it's kind of a recurring theme with the pin placements.   There were some tough pins throughout today where we talked to John Daly earlier about sometimes it's better to be 30 feet away than five feet away.   This course is playing very difficult.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it's playing difficult.   It plays difficult every day.   I don't think I've ever played where it wasn't.   Just got to take what you can, try to keep getting on the green and get a birdie.  
   
 Q.   Were you surprised   to see a score like Harris's this morning the way the scores are?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I mean, you know, it's obviously tough there, but he's off and playing very well and putting very well, too.   That's key around here, got to make putts.   He's obviously doing that.  
   
 Q.   You played a year ago and done so well.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   The wind is blowing in a completely different direction.   But everybody is playing the same way.   This course plays tough no matter which way the wind blows.  
   
 Q.   How difficult is it to sign autographs if there are 200 people or whatever?   What can a fan do to get your attention?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I hate when people put autographs in my face.   Just be patient.   Sometimes people get a little too close to you.  
   
 Q.   You need your personal space.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm going to get there.   I don't like when they -- I don't mind the kids.   Kids can do whatever they want.   But the adults pushing kids out of the way for money.   It's okay.   I'm going to get there.   But, you know, I try to get everybody's autograph.   I'll take my time.
