  Q. 30-under par, you just reached world No. 1 again.  You're first in the FedExCup standings.  Your 22nd victory and you put on an absolute clinic.  Can you describe how good your game is right now, and what it has taken to get to this point?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Obviously this is a really good week.  I've really -- my ball-striking was unbelievable.  I found something on Wednesday.  Felt like I was swinging really good but something clicked on Wednesday.  I really, really hit it well on Thursday.  I didn't really make a lot of putts, but I really went and worked hard on my putting on Thursday afternoon, and it paid off.  Obviously I rolled it really nicely on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
 Q. You're not a guy to look back, but how much of the PGA Championship, and almost carding 59 and now looking forward to what is on tap, it's going to be some of the biggest events that we see in the next few months.  How much does all of that play into how hard you've been working to create what you've just created?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, at the PGA I felt like I played really good on Sunday.  I made a nice solid -- I played a nice, solid round.  Obviously Collin played very well.
 Yeah, this week, I played some really good golf, and it was a lot of fun.  So I'm looking forward to the rest of the FedExCup Playoffs.  Obviously I've got myself into a really good position going into East Lake and next week, too.  Next week is a big tournament and I'm looking forward to going and playing Olympia Fields.
