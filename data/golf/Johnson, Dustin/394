Q.   Did you feel like you left a few shots out there? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I played pretty solid today.   Just hit a couple bad drives on the back, but that's going to happen.   But I still had a lot of really good looks at birdie, and you know, just couldn't really capitalize on any of them. 

Q.   The putt on 17, did you think that was in? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I did.   I thought it was going right in the right center it kind of‑‑ even when it hit the hole I still thought it was going in and I still don't know how it didn't. 

Q.   Position going into the next few days, obviously you're not that far back, which isn't perfect; are you feeling comfortable with the way you're playing in regards to what's going on in front of you? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   You know, very comfortable with how I'm playing.   I think I'm playing really well right now.   Rolling the putter really well, too, so got a lot of confidence with it.   You know, just got to, I mean, I'm three back going into the weekend, and if I keep playing like I am, I'm going to give it a good shot.
