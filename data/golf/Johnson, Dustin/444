Q.   Dustin, it's been a great afternoon for the Americans, no question about it, and there's a match up ahead.   How do you like the four‑ball portion of this?   Does it give you a chance to be more aggressive? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, you know, the four‑ball is good.   We had a game plan going out.   We just wanted to get two looks at birdie all day.   That's how you can get ahead and put some pressure on them if you've got two looks on every hole.   Between me and him, we're both good putters; one of them is going to go in.
