Q. Gentlemen, I did not see this pairing come, but that seemed to be the perfect formula right there?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: We played together at Medinah and really enjoyed playing with each other.  Did well.  Again, we practiced a little bit together.  We really like the pairing.  I get to hit out of the fairway on the hole and Matt gets to hit closer to the green.  It works out well.
Q. He putted so well for you.  That had to be fun to watch.
MATT KUCHAR: It's brilliant.  This guy is playing such good golf.  It's fun for me.  I try not to screw things up out there.  It's been a great pairing.  We've had some success in the past and it was great to get out and get the lead early and keep it going.
