Q. An opening round with five birdies and two bogeys for 3-under. Give us your reflections on that one.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I felt like I played pretty well. Just the three-putt on 17 was bad. I just missed a short one and then lipped-out a pretty short putt on 3 for par. Those were the only two bogeys. So really wasn't out of position too much. I felt like I drove it pretty well. Hit a lot of good shots. 3-under is a solid score. I feel like the golf course is much more difficult this year than it was last year, just because the rough's up, and the greens are a little faster.
Q. You mentioned it being more difficult. Does that mean you change your tactical approach? Last year you were hitting lots of drivers and going for it because the rough wasn't too penal. Any different this year?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, you have to be a little -- you have to attack the course differently this year for sure just because you can't play out of the rough. Whereas last year, it was no problem. And so yeah, definitely played a few different clubs off the tees just to try to get it in the fairway.
Q. We really admire your course management. You seem to find it fairly straightforward and don't stand over a shot thinking for ten minutes what different options you've got. Do you find it pretty straightforward to choose the right shot?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, it's fairly simple. You get a number and it tells you how far you need to hit it, and then you kind of just need to hit it right there. I mean, it's pretty simple.
Obviously some people take longer to calculate things, but this course, it doesn't give you a whole lot of options, especially when the wind is down like this. It's a little bit easier. But if the wind picks up and blows kind of the direction it was yesterday, then you have a few more options on 7 and 17 where you can actually try to get it up on the greens hitting driver.
