 Q.   Can you just sum up the feeling, two strong performances, but no W's, just your thoughts?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, I mean, I'm playing good.   Not playing great but I'm playing good, solid, and you know today I played really solid, hit some poor shots but I was able to save pars on those.   Just coming down the stretch, I thought I hit a lot better shot on 16 where it ended up, ended up just short in the rough and I had to make a pretty good up‑and‑down just to save par.   
Then 17 and 18, 18 I definitely thought I hit a better shot.   17 I just hit a poor one.   So I didn't really have good clans on 16, 17 and 18 to make a little bit better of a run, but you know, when you shoot 14‑under on the weekend, it's tough to beat that.  
   
 Q.   This is twice you've come in with a great score and you've had to sit and watch other players.   Is that hard to do?   What's that like?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I was out in front, so you just do whatever you can and you come in and you watch and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   Talk about 17‑‑  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I just hit a poor shot.   For me got to keep it a little left because you can't drive it in the bunker.   But I was fine there, I had a great look at the flag.   I just kind of pull‑hooked one.   
   
 Q.   You obviously got off to the good start, but when you look back now, do you think what would have been or could have been?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   You know, it's tough.   The golf course, even with not a lot of wind, it still plays tough, and with the greens firm and fast, it plays very difficult.   You know, just really didn't home the putts that I needed to on Friday and Saturday, but you know, today I did.   Just got to make those short putts.   Friday and Saturday, I didn't do that, but Thursday and Sunday, I did, and I was still right there with a chance to win.   
I thought 14 would probably do it.   I figured I needed to shoot six.   You never know.
