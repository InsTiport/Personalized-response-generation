Q.   Tell us how the body is holding up?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   My knee is okay.   I'm not worried about it.
My lower back is really stiff and hurting, which I think is from the way I'm walking or the fact that I have not walked a lot since the surgery.   Yesterday was the first time I walked a full 18 holes.
I do intend to play next week in San Diego.
