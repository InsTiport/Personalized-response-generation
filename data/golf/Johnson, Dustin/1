  Q. Big putts on 16 and 17 and then you had a chance.  I thought you made that one here at 18.
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I hit a really good putt.  It was a tough match.  Obviously the conditions today were a little bit more difficult with the wind.  It was tough to get a good beat on it.  I just hit a couple good shots that ended up not so good there on -- right off the bat on 2, kind of gave him the hole there, and then 14 didn't help, either.
 You know, a couple good shots, though.  I thought I hit a really good shot on 2 and I thought I hit a good shot on 14, and I kind of gave him the hole on 11, also.  Ended up making a really good halve, and definitely pleased with it.  Playing good.  Obviously need to go out tomorrow and shoot a good score or play well and win that match.
 Q. Thoughts on the strategy at 18?  The wind has kind of died down here but you laid up off the tee.
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I did.  Obviously I knew where the flag was, and laying back I can use the back board and spin it.  Driving it down to the bottom it's not an easy pitch, especially with the wind dying down, so you don't really have the wind to help you stop it.  Thought I hit a better shot than I did, just caught a gust of wind and I was trying to fly it eight to ten behind the hole and flew it pin high.  Just got a little bit of a gust of wind.
