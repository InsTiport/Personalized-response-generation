 Q. Nice solid round of golf for you. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I had it going today pretty good and then had a little hiccup on 14 I think. Just blocked it just a smidge, just on the edge of the stuff and couldn't find the ball. Was hoping to find it and maybe chop it out and make a four but indicated up making double-bogey.

 Q. You've had a double-bogey in each of your rounds but still one shot off the lead?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm hitting the ball good. Maybe just a little bit rusty. But playing well. Still today, I shot 7-under with a double, and I missed a lot of short putts for birdie. 

 Q. 353 off the tee at 17, 373 off the tee at 18?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit two good drives on 17, 18, which are two holes that today, they are playing a little into the wind, so you know, to get some good drives off those two holes is definitely helpful.

 Q. Talk about playing this golf course, how short you can make this golf course?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, if I drive it straight, it definitely favors long hitters because we can get the ball down there closer to some of the greens. I've been driving it pretty well the last two days so, it definitely plays to my advantage, hitting wedges into a lot of these holes.

 Q. What's the longest club you've hit into a par 4?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Probably 6-iron. 

 Q. Have you picked up yardage with the new driver?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.

 Q. Is it hard to get used to the white top to it when you look down? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it looks good. It really -- I didn't have any issue at all. 

 Q. You are playing Sony next week?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yes.

 Q. I thought you said the other day you weren't going to play it. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Playing Sony. 

 Q. A little bit of a difference for you. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, but I like the golf course. It sets up well for me.

 Q. Did you go over there a couple of years ago but not play? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, two years ago. I played my rookie year and then I played last year. I didn't play in between. 

 Q. Is there any golf course that doesn't setup well for you if you're hitting it in the fairway with your length? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: If I'm driving it straight, then that's a lot of my game -- if I'm driving it in the fairway, then I'm going to have a lot of opportunities to make birdie.

 Q. So that's your key for the week, fairways?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, not necessarily fairways because a lot of these holes, like I can't hit it in the fairway. 6, I can't hit the fairway on 6. But I can drive it right next to the green. And then 14, I made double today, but I can't hit the fairway there really. 

 Q. Where did you put it? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I pushed it just barely right. I thought it was going to catch the right bunker, but it landed in the bushes right there just this far right of the bunker. We couldn't find it. Of course nobody's looking or watching. 

 Q. Does this course play a lot shorter than the yardage? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I don't even know the yardage. But yeah, the longer holes do, just because most of the longer holes are downhill. But then there's a lot of holes like 9 that plays a lot longer than the yardage or the uphill holes. So it seems like there's way more downhill holes than uphill. 

 Q. And this is certainly costing you just to keep the foot on the gas?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, if you get it rolling, other than if I don't -- I made five in a row going into 14. I got 14 and 15 ahead of me. I hit 7-iron into 15 today. 14 was -- I don't know, just a terrible drive. But you can get on a roll out here if you make a couple putts and you're driving it well.
