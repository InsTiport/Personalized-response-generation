  Q. Good bounceback today. Really a solid come back today.   
 DUSTINJOHNSON: Yeah, I hit the ball really well today. I drove it pretty straight, hit it in a few first cuts but other than that I didn't really miss any fairways. I hit it really close, made a few putts. I've been struggling with the putter. I didn't struggle today. I was hitting the ball where I was looking and a few of them went in. Got kind of a bad break there on 9, got a little bit of a mud ball and it shot right and still had a chance to get up-and-down but just didn't do it.  
  
  Q. I know you've been working on your driving accuracy. That's the key in a place like this and next week, right?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it doesn't matter how far you hit it, especially out here. You've got to be in the fairway, though, so you can control the spin coming into the greens. If you miss the fairways out here a lot of times you don't have a shot at the green.  
  
  Q. Talk about the weekend because you're really in good shape.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I knew I had to come out and get a good round in this morning, and I did. I wasn't too happy with the way I got started off. Made a bunch of pars but I had a lot of good looks, just nothing was going in the hole. Eventually got a little settled in with the putter and started making some putts.  
  
  Q. Confidence has got to be high going into Saturday.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm really feeling good. I'm swinging the club well, so I'm hitting it close a lot. So I got a lot of good looks at birdie. If I can just get a few putts to drop, I'm going to play well this weekend.
