 Q. What is it about this place you're so comfortable with?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know, ever since I've come here, I've loved playing here. Today was a good day. I hit the ball well. I had a couple of loose drives on the back, but I held it together pretty good and made a few good putts coming down the stretch.

 Q. You're not afraid to hit the driver, and power is obviously a big part of the equation to play this golf course, can we expect to see that tomorrow?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Nothing is going to change with the game plan tomorrow. I'm driving it really straight right now, I'm confident in the driver and I like to hit it.
