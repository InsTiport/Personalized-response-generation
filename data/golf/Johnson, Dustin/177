Q. Obviously a tough day.  What happened out there?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, it was tough conditions today.  Felt like I actually drove it pretty well, other than the drive on 2, which I hit a good shot.  I don't even know what happened.  It just came up a little bit short.  I thought I hit it perfect.  But still ended up making a good 6.
And even making the turn obviously, I'm 2-over, which is fine.  I know I've got to just play solid on the back nine.  I didn't make any putts.  I felt like I rolled it good.  Just nothing was going in the hole.  Hit a couple really bad iron shots.  That was probably the key there on 14.  I just chunked it.
Same thing on 15; I just chunked it.  That cost me two shots there.
And then bogeying 16, that's just bad.  So I just gave a few away.  But tough conditions.  But I mean, it is what it is.
Q. How did you feel at the driving range during the warmup?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I was fine.  I mean, I felt fine all day.  I just could never get anything going and didn't hole any putts.  It was pretty simple.
