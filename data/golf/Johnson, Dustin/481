   DUSTIN JOHNSON: Over the last two days I have played courses that I have never been to before - and today in particular, here at Carnoustie, it's one of those courses when you have to see it before you can play it. I putted badly again today and also drove it in a couple of bunkers which didn't help, but Carnoustie is obviously a very good course and I can see that when the wind picks up it would be very tough. It's a shame that I couldn't come here a bit earlier this week to get in some additional practice but my schedule just didn't allow me to do that. But I've enjoyed the last two days and at least I've played these courses now so I will know them a lot better for the next time. Tomorrow it is the Old Course and I've played that a few times before so I should be okay there.
