  DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I stuck to my game plan, and obviously I played really well on the last few holes of the front nine and had a great back nine.   But the guys, they made it really interesting, and you know, I just played really good coming down the stretch. 

Q.   You were up against a couple of bulldogs, players who love match play; did you feel the intensity?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Oh, I knew they were going to come out swinging.   I held them off, and fortunately I played really well coming down the stretch.   The last few holes here, if you play them well, you can make some birdies.   But they are tough holes.   You know, it was a lot of fun out there today.   It was a good match from both of them.   They put a lot of pressure on me, but I'm really proud of myself the way I handled it and the way I finished. 

Q.   The guys in the box were saying you showed a lot of maturity and patience today.   Do you feel that's something that you learned and improved on?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yes, you know, it takes a while to learn that, especially I wish I would have had some a few times a few years ago.   But you learn from your mistakes and you try to get better from them and I think I showed a lot of patience out there and a lot of discipline with different clubs and shot selection.   I played really solid today.
Also, I just want to thank HSBC.   I think they did a great job this week.   The tournament's fantastic. 

Q.   How did you sleep last night?   Because you could have been five or six shots ahead, and you had that horrible double‑bogey finish; did that bother you? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I was mad.   I was mad at myself for 18 yesterday, it was playing pretty easy, and for me to make double on 18 yesterday was just very poor, especially as good as I'm playing.   So I was a little angry, but I knew I just needed to come out today and play my golf and it will take care of itself.   Yeah, I was definitely a little mad but I slept just fine last night.

Q.   Was there a key turning point for you today? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   The putt on 14.   After I drove it in the rough and then hit it just short of the green, I hit a very poor wedge shot, left it about 20 feet short, and you know, Graeme made about a 50‑footer, and for me to make the next one right after he did, especially since Poulter was already in for a birdie, I think that was a big turning point there.   Obviously the pitch in on 16 helped a little, too. 

Q.   You've come so close in Majors, do you feel that this might be the springboard that will help you to get over the line? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, this is probably my biggest win, and with the field and the tournament, World Golf Championships.   Hopefully there's just better things to come.
