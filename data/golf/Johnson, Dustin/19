  Q. You started out, got a few birdies early, finished even for the day.  Talk me through how you felt out there with your game.
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I played better.  Obviously the finish there, had a really good look there on 6 that just burned the edge, and then 7 I just -- it was a terrible shot, caught it a little heavy.  And then honestly, just the finish, I just lost a few shots there bogeying 7 and 8, missed a short putt on 6 and then obviously not birdieing 9.  Just didn't hit the fairway.
 Yeah, played solid.  Definitely much better than yesterday.  Obviously didn't score that well coming down the stretch, but I played well.  I'm happy with the game.
 I think still on this golf course with the conditions that we're supposed to have the next couple days, I don't feel like I'm out of it.  I'm going to have to play really well, but I like where I'm at.  I think obviously two solid rounds and right back in the mix.
 So hopefully -- it was a little better today, get a little better tomorrow and then even better on Sunday, and I'll be right there.
