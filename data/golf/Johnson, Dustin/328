Q. That was a really tough match.  You were up early, Danny Lee battled back and he actually took the lead on 14.  What was going through your mind and how you approached those last four holes to pull out this win?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, the golf course is playing really difficult.  Obviously got up to a big lead and gave him a hole at 4 and he made some good birdies to get back in the match.  I just didn't really hole any putts.  I had some good looks to win and win some holes.  It was a tough match.  It's very tough conditions out here right now, and definitely happy to put a point on the board for the U.S.
