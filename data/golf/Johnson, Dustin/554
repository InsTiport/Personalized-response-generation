   DOUG MILNE: We'd like to welcome the clubhouse leader Dustin Johnson into the media center here at the Northern Trust Open. Dustin, thanks for joining us for a few minutes, bogey-free 7-under 64 today, great way to start, just a few comments on the round and then we'll open it up for questions. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Got off to a good start, hit some good shots on 10 and didn't make the putt, but went to 11, hit two good shots just left of the green, got up-and-down.
 Then I made a real good birdie. I made about a 50-footer on 12 for birdie. So got off to a good start, had good vibes going all day, and just hit the ball really good all day long. 

 Q. What do you like about this golf course? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I just like the setup of it. It's always in good shape. It really fits my eye well. The greens are really good here. It's just a fun course to play. You've got to hit every club in your bag, and you've got to be smart coming into the greens just because you want to hit yourself on the right side of the hole. 

 Q. What's been your -- sorry I didn't see your playing record here. What's been your best score here?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Finished Top 10 here last year. I don't know what my low score is, but I think I finished 10th here last year or something. 

 Q. Do you know anything about or did you pay any attention to the history of this golf course and the kind of winners that have been here throughout history? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I've looked at it, so I've seen all the history at this course. I mean, the place is just fantastic, and it's held its own for a long time, and it'll stay there at the top of all the golf courses. 

 Q. Can we go through your card? Just give us some clubs and yardages as best you recall. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: 11, I was pin high left of the green, just chipped up to probably eight feet, made birdie.
 12, I hit my tee ball a little right and I hit it on the back of the green and maybe 50, 60 feet I made it on 12.
 Then I birdied 14. I hit a 9-iron, I think, to about 15 feet right behind the hole. 
 And then 17 I hit a bad tee ball in the right bunker and I had to just hit it out of the bunker in the fairway and had probably 165 hole and hit 8-iron in there pretty close, probably ten feet, and made it on 17. 
 Made a good 4 on 18, hit it just over the green in two, got up-and-down.
 Hit two good shots on 1 to about eight feet for eagle, missed it, but tapped in for birdie. 

 Q. What was the club into the 1st hole?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: 6-iron. 
 Then hit two good shots on 3, just missed the putt, hit it about probably 10 feet on 3, lipped it out. 
 I hit it probably six feet on 5 and just missed it. I had a lot of putts that were kind of -- down the hill, but couldn't really -- they were tough to read.
 Then I birdied 7 and 8 coming in. 7, I hit 3-iron, 8-iron.
 And then 8, I hit 3-iron, 9-iron. Both of them -- I hit it probably five feet on 7 and probably 15 feet on 8 and made it. 

 Q. Do you find it harder to chip on the kikuyu, and do you have different wedges in your bag than you did a year ago?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I haven't changed anything. I like the grass. I don't struggle chipping out here usually. 
 DOUG MILNE: Dustin, congratulations on a great first round, and best of luck heading forward.
