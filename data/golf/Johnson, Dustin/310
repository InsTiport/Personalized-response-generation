Q. Patrick Reed came up against kind of a buzz saw today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I played well.  He played well, too.  Started out, we both birdied the first two holes.  And then he birdied 6 to go 1-up.  I made the turn, made a bunch of birdies on the backside, I think I made four or five in a row.  It was a tough match, though.  He never let up.  He never gave me any holes and I didn't give him any.
Q. That's one of the great things about match play.  Do you have fun?  Would you like to see more of it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I think it's a lot of fun.  It's something we don't do very often, twice a year, and then if you play on the Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup team.
I enjoy it, it's a lot of fun.  If you do hit a bad shot you can just go on to the next hole.
