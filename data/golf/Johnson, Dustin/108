 Q.  How would you assess your play today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought I played pretty well.  Drove it pretty good, hit some really good iron shots.  The wind definitely picked up about halfway through our front nine, which made the course play a little bit more difficult.  But felt like I hit it well and gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Obviously the greens are -- they're tough to read, and I really struggled to read them.  I feel like I'm a really good green reader.  I was actually hitting my putts really good, too, and they're just hard to read.  It's pretty simple.   
 Q.  Is part of that the speed?  Obviously they're tough to read because of the undulation, but also you're not really used to this sort of speed.  They're only 10.3 on the stimp.  You're used to 11, 12, 12 and a half.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: 10.3 would be pushing it very high.  But yeah, I mean, they're slow, but yeah, they're just tough to read.  The slopes -- the ones that are on slopes are easy to read.  It's the ones that are a little flatter, they just seem like they've got a little bit of grain in them, so the grain really affects them.  Yeah, it's just tough to get a good read on them.   
 Q.  How much are you looking forward to getting out there in the morning?  Generally it's expected to be calmer conditions.  We saw some great scores this morning, making some birdies.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, if I keep hitting it like I'm doing, I'll definitely make a lot of birdies tomorrow morning.   
 Q.  How much are you enjoying the new driver?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, the driver is really good.  I'm really happy, actually switched into an M6 this week, and yeah, I'm driving is really good.  I've got a lot of confidence in it.  Yeah, I mean, I love the driver.  I'm definitely pleased with it.
