Q. How would you assess your week?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was okay.  I just made too many mistakes.  I just felt like I gave away way too many shots.  The first second and third -- every day really -- even today I played really well today, I just didn't make any putts.  I had a lot of good chances, just didn't make anything.  I hit good putts too, just weren't going in.  But yesterday I gave -- I just gave away too many shots, especially the second day.  I really felt like I gave away six or seven shots there.  That's kind of the difference between having a chance to win and finishing where I did.
Q. What do you feel like you need to tighten up before you head over to Middle East?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel like the game's in good form.  I practiced a little bit yesterday afternoon.  I felt like I got the golf swing in a good position.  I feel like I got a lot of confidence in it.  I hit a lot of really good shots today.  I'll just go home and work on the short game, wedges.  And I feel like I'm driving it really well.  I definitely drove it better today.  I hit a lot of really good drives, so.
Q. Is this just knocking off some competitive rust, do you think?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I wasn't really rusty, I just wasn't hitting the shots that I was seeing.  It was just one of those weeks where, I mean the wrong shot just kept coming up.
