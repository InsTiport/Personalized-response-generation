 Q.  They got off to a fast start and it was hard to draw it back?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, we never gave them anything. Yeah, they did. They birdied the first five holes, and you know, obviously it's tough conditions. They just made a few more putts than we did. We hit some good putts that, you know, could have gone in, but you know, they just didn't.   
It was a good match. They played really well. I felt like we hung in there. We didn't give them anything. That was the big thing. But yeah, we got down early and it was just -- yeah, it was, it was hard to get anything back.   
 Q.  Conditions different from a competition round to practice round, and as you found today, the ball goes into strange places here sometimes.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It does. I was pleased with the way I hit it. I gave myself a lot of looks at birdie, and that's what you've got to do. You know, like I said, even when they got out of position a couple times, we just could never really get any momentum back after the first few holes.   
 Q.  And the body okay?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, everything's great. I feel good. Body feels good. Knee's good. Like I said I'm really happy with the way I played.
