DUSTIN JOHNSON: I felt like I played pretty well.  Just didn't putt very well.  Struck it pretty good.  I struck it nicely enough to shoot a good score.  Just struggled a little bit with my speed on the greens.  And then quite a few up-and-downs I should have had that I didn't.  But, again, there's putting, chipping, whatever.
All in all 1-over in these conditions is not too bad.  A little frustrated with the round, for sure.
Q. The conditions were quite tricky out there.  Do you need to stay patient?  How do you overcome those frustrations so you don't let it get away?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: You have to stay patient in these conditions.  The golf course is tough.  You have to drive it straight.  You have to hit real quality iron shots if you want to get it close to the hole.
But I felt like I did everything pretty well, just didn't roll it that great today.
Q. Will you do anything this afternoon or this evening on the putting green?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm about to go right now.
