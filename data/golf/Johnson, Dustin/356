 Q.  Obviously not the way you wanted to finish.  But talk about the round.  Did it leave a bitter taste in your mouth or are you feeling okay?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: I made a pretty good bogey on the last.  I hit a poor drive in that right bunker, which you can't do that.  It's one place you can't hit it on that hole.  I knew that sitting on the tee, I hit a bad shot. But I thought I played pretty well today.  It played really difficult.  When I got into trouble I felt I hit good shots and got myself out of it and made some good up-and-downs.  But just didn't hole the putts that like yesterday.  That was pretty much the only difference. I had a lot of good looks out there, even on the bogeys I made I had good looks at par.  And I missed quite a few short birdie putts.  I feel like I'm putting it well.  Hit some good putts.  It's just sometimes they go in, sometimes they don't.   Q.  Over those last five holes, which shot would you most want back?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'd like to have the drive on 18 back.  I just put myself in a very bad position.   Q.  The lip of the bunker on your second shot?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I hit it -- it was sitting down a little bit and I just hit it a hair heavy.   Q.  When the ball leaves your putter, do you feel like it's going to be on the line that you intended it to be on?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  I mean, if I'm stroking it well it comes off on the line that I want it.  If you hit a good putt it goes where you want it to. But the really hard putts are the downhill ones where you can't just hit it, you just have to touch them.  You're just kind of guessing.  Those are the hard ones.  But if you leave yourself uphill putts, you're hitting it on the right spot on the greens, you can make them.  They're rolling good enough to make putts.   Q.  Did you have a number in mind today?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I was just going out and trying to shoot as low as I could.   Q.  There are 12 players within 4 strokes of the lead going into tomorrow.  What do you think of that?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, tomorrow is going to be a good test, I would imagine, they're going to set it up pretty hard.  So I've got a good game plan out here, I just need to stick to it.  If I keep swinging well and keep putting well, it will be right there come Sunday.   Q.  What is the game plan tomorrow?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: I have a game plan for the course.  I don't have -- there's no like game plan, just each hole what I'm going to do on each hole.   Q.  There were so many that fell just short of the cup.  Were you satisfied overall with the way you're playing or were there ones where you wished it would have gone in the cup because there were so many that were short?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I hit a lot of good putts today.  I don't think I really hit any bad ones.  They're tough to read and it's tough to get the speed down.  They've gotten really fast this afternoon.   Q.  Any one in particular you found especially tough from yesterday morning to this afternoon?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's definitely different.  In the morning the ball stops a little bit quicker and the greens are a foot or so slower.  So it definitely helps the earlier you play. But I'll be playing tomorrow afternoon, which is fine.  That's where I want to play, especially on a Saturday.  But just if you strike it well you can get it close to the hole.   Q.  Do you like your position?  Do you feel positive going into tomorrow?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I like where I'm at.  Still got 36 holes of golf, a lot can happen.  2 back going into tomorrow, that's fine with me.  I like where I'm at.
