Q. Great round, 66.  Only the one dropped shot.  What was working out there for you today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I did everything pretty well today.  I felt like I was driving it really good, hit a lot of great iron shots and rolled the putter pretty nicely, too.  It was just an all-around good day.
Q. How different from yesterday with those winds down?  Did it just feel like a day where 66 was out there?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, you've still got to play really good because the golf course is firm.  It's tough to get it in the fairways, and then the greens are firm, too, so it's tough to get it close to the flag.  Yesterday, I just didn't play good yesterday.  It was pretty simple.  It was windy.  It made it a little tougher, but I played terrible.
