DUSTIN JOHNSON: Obviously you have to hole some putts here.  I felt like I putted well, it just didn't go in.  Everything was burning the edges.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, obviously seeing the guys in the morning, they had the front straight down and the back kind of a little more in, but you know the front nine I felt probably played a little bit tougher for us because it wasn't really helping.  It was just right to left.  Obviously the back nine wasn't as tough either.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, Martin played great.  He played just solid.  No bogies, five birdies, so just a really solid round.   
 Q.  Will anything change tomorrow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, still got to go out and play golf.   
 Q.  You enjoy the challenge?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Just whatever the conditions are you've got to play in them.
