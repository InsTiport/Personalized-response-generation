 Q.  What was the story of today's round for you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I just didn't putt very well.  I missed a lot of really good opportunities.  That was the big key for me.  If I don't three-putt, I shoot even.  But if I just make one or two of the good looks I have, it's a couple under.  I didn't hit it great, but I hit it good enough to shoot a good score.   
 Q.  Where did things go wrong on 14?  Would you consider hitting something else off the tee?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, where it went wrong is where I laid it up in the hay, that's where it went wrong.  And then I got on the green and three-putted for a double.  It was a great hole I played there.   
 Q.  How would you describe your round?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm a little frustrated that I shot 3-over.  But it wasn't -- I didn't play that bad.  I just didn't putt very good.  It wasn't that I was hitting bad putts, my speed was a little off.  I'd either miss it -- hit it just high and lip it out or they went across the front edge of the hole.  My speed was a little off.  I felt like I was hitting good putts, just didn't go on the hole.   
 Q.  Does that change your approach for tomorrow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I'm playing good.  The golf course -- you've got to hit it in the fairway.  I hit enough fairways today to shoot a good score.  But I've definitely got to roll it better.  I'm swinging good, everything feels good, I just need to make more putts here.   
 Q.  Having the baby and coming in here, did you feel prepared when you stepped on the first tee?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I felt good.  Everything feels good.  The putter was feeling really good.  But I felt like -- like I said, I felt like I rolled it where I was looking, just didn't get it in the hole.   
 Q.  Do you think they've got a good U.S. Open setup here for now and in the future?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: We'll have to see.  Obviously it would be interesting if it played really firm and fast.  Right now it's really soft.  The greens are soft, so you can get to the green with any club.  That's why you're seeing some big scores, because the greens are so receptive.  I think if it got really firm it would definitely play difficult.
