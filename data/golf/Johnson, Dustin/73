DUSTIN JOHNSON: Definitely a lot more receptive than it was last time we were here.  But it's still difficult.  You still got to hit good shots and drive it in the fairway.  The rough is a lot deeper.  I feel like it's a lot more challenging if you miss the fairway.
But, yeah, I mean, the golf course I thought played really well.  If you play from the fairway, you can shoot a really good score.
Q. Do you feel like (indiscernible) red number, you feel a bit disappointed with it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I hit my irons really bad today.  I felt like I drove it pretty well and I was putting well, it just -- I didn't get enough chances at birdie.  Yeah.  I just -- I don't know.  Probably the worst I've hit my ions all year.
Q. What'd you do on 6 (indiscernible) struck that badly or --
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, no I actually hit a really good shot to get it there.  I was in a pitch mark of -- my ball was in someone else's pitch mark.  So sitting down really bad.
Q. Kuchar's do you think?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was a Kuchar.  But hit a nice shot and then didn't hit a great pitch.
Q. (Indiscernible) is talking about starting on 10 (indiscernible) on the front nine, do you have a feeling you just don't (indiscernible) well on the back and score on the front?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, yeah, obviously 9 and 10 -- 8, 9, and 10 are very difficult holes.  But if you're in the fairway, none of them are that difficult, if you can control your ball.
The greens are small.  If you're driving in the fairway and you're hitting -- obviously if you're controlling your irons well, you can get a lot of good looks at birdie.
