 Q.   Dustin, tell us about your day.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Played okay today.   Got off to a rough start.   But just didn't hole any putts.   I had seven putts lip out today or something, something crazy.   I hit a lot of putts.   They just didn't go in the hole.  
   
 Q.   Is that frustrating?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's a bit frustrating.  
   
 Q.   Are you happy with the way you're striking it?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm hitting the ball really well.   Just couldn't get anything to go in the hole.   
   
 Q.   What about the jetâ€‘lag, you over that yet?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I'm good.   Feel good.   Just you know, hit a lot of good shots.   Just couldn't get it in the hole.  
   
 Q.   You enjoy playing with your brother?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, having a good time.  
   
 Q.   How's he been playing?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   He's playing okay.   Hit or miss.   
   
 Q.   Mainly miss?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, he's in about half the holes.   
   
 Q.   Is it a nice relaxing format?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, we have a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Excited for St. Andrews tomorrow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, excited.   I love playing St. Andrews.   It's always a lot of fun to play that course.   Especially if the weather is like this, that's a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Played there many times?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I've played there quite a few.   
   
 Q.   Had a good record?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I usually fair pretty well at St. Andrews.  
   
 Q.   Enjoy your trips over to Europe?   Likely to see you more often over here?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I do enjoy it.   I enjoy coming to this tournament, playing with my brother.   You know, last year and this year, we've had great weather.   It's really nice.   
   
 Q.   It's a nice, social week off the course, as well.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it's a lot of fun, all the guys seem to hang out and have a good time.   
   
 Q.   How do you rate Kingsbarns, and if you've got a favorite hole, which one would that be?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Kingsbarns is a great course.   I like playing it.   It's really pretty.   It's fun.   You can make a lot of birdies here even though I didn't today; I struggled a bit.   But you can definitely take advantage here if you play well.   
   
 Q.   Any favourite hole, if you were to name one?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   There's a lot of good ones, it's hard to pick a favorite.   I like them all.
