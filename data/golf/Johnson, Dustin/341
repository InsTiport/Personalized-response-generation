Q. I guess, first off, thoughts on the weather delay and not being able to get finished with the second round today.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It is what it is, but hopefully it will help me out.  I'm just struggling a little bit today.  It felt like I was hitting some good shots, just not driving it as well today.  But still feel like I'm swinging well, just the driver was just a little bit off, so I missed a couple fairways.  And this golf course, if you are not driving it in the fairways, it's tough.  But I'm in a good position on 15, right down the middle.
Hopefully I can come back in the morning and make a couple birdies coming in and then we'll get the day started on Saturday.
Q. What's kind of the plan now that play has been called?  Go home and rest?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, just go rest, because it's going to be a really long day tomorrow.  So go home and get as much rest as I can.  It's going to be -- yeah, I mean, we're going to come out in the morning, finish three and a half holes and then going to have to turn around and tee off.
Q. How much does this help you, you had an up-and-down day?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, it would have been nice to finish.  I finally felt like I was swinging pretty good.  I hit two really good shots on 14, but it was getting dark, it was tough to see.  I hit it and it just one hopped and just over the green, which is no good on 14.  I hit a perfect drive, hit my second shot right at the flag, just a little too far.  I made a bad bogey there.
And then hit a great drive on 15.  So, I feel good, just couldn't really get anything going today.
Q. How much harder was it this afternoon than yesterday morning?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Today wasn't -- I think it was more difficult yesterday.  But just didn't drive it as well today.  That's all.
