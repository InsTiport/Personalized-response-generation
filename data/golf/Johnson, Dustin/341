 Q.  Level par round today; you weren't feeling too good, pulled out of the Pro-Am yesterday how are you feeling right now?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Not great.  Probably 70 percent.  Today just did not hit the ball very well.  I hit it about like I feel.  That about sums it up.   
 Q.  One of your undoubted highlights today, the eagle at the 4th, 326 and driving the green?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Good drive today, that's about it.  It came at a good time, too.  To hit the ball up there on the green, that was a really good shot.  So I was definitely pleased with that.  Highlight of the day for sure.   
 Q.  Obviously the defending champion here at Plainfield with a victory four years ago.  Nice to be back for you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I enjoy this golf course.  It's in great shape right now.  I just didn't play very well today, that's all.   
 Q.  But from what you've achieved this year and the success you've had, what are your he feelings as you head into these Playoff events and what this could do to end a great season?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I've had a great season so far and definitely looking forward to the Playoff events.  This is a crucial time to play really well to get yourself in good position for THE TOUR Championship to have a chance at that FedExCup.
