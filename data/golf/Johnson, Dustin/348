 Q.  Nice way to close your round today.  Just talk about the second round.  DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought it was pretty solid.  Got off to kind of a little bit of a rough start.  I was 2-over, or something, through five holes, I think.  But didn't hit -- I felt like I hit good shots too, and I was still over par.  But you miss the greens out here, it's just so hard to get up and down, especially if you're in the wrong spot. But definitely felt like I played really well on the back nine.  Had a lot of good looks at birdie.  Made a really good par save on 10.  But other than that, I had good looks at birdie, I think, on just about every hole except for 15, I think, where I made bogey. I felt like I played really solid on the back nine, and then obviously to close with two birdies.  I missed a three-footer on 16 for birdie.  So really played well down the stretch.   Q.  Was there a shot that maybe turned the round around in a positive direction?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, probably on 6, the tee ball on 6.  I hit a really good tee ball down there on 6, had 90 yards to the hole and made birdie.  Hit it in there five feet and made it.  I think that was kind of a turnaround. Hit a poor shot on 7, but was able to get it up and down.  Then played pretty good. Then birdied 9.  At 8, I hit it in the rough and hit it on the green and just two-putted.  But 9, I drove it down the middle.  Hit a sand wedge in there to about five, six feet, and then made it.  So I think that was kind of the turning point of the round.   Q.  This isn't a place where you traditionally have a lot of success.  Can you pinpoint what's changed for you through two rounds this time around?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel like I'm driving it a little better than normal out here.  But I felt like I've been driving well all year.  So before -- this year, I think my driver is definitely better, and my misses aren't as big. Out here, it's hard to hit the fairways, but as long as you don't miss it too far offline, you can still hack it up there on the green or just around the green, which helps.  I think in years past I've had too many chip-outs.   Q.  Being this dry, you have a totally different approach.  It's usually not like this.  DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it usually plays a little bit softer, but when it's playing firm and fast, it's tough. Jim shooting 8-under for two rounds, that's really impressive.  Obviously, he's doing everything pretty well, which this golf course calls for.  You've got to do everything well.  Every club in your bag, you've got to hit well.   Q.  When you and Bubba are kind of all over the map, does that affect -- I mean, was that fun?  You know what I mean?  DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's exciting.  It's fun.  I'm going to make some bogeys out here, that's just how it goes.  The golf course is hard.  But also, I'm going to make a lot of birdies, which I did today.  Just played solid.  It's one of those golf courses where, if you hit good shots, you can make birdies.  If you hit bad ones, you make bogeys.
