  DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Drove it well, hit it well.   I holed a couple putts but I missed quite a few short ones.  
   
 Q.   And you're fully aware of what it takes around this course, and you'll have known before you started just what the scoring was like?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, today, not a lot of wind blowing.   It was hot, perfect conditions.   You're going to have to play really well.  
   
 Q.   Is it nice to know that you can open your shoulders a bit after the troubles of Merion last week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, that golf course was playing really tough, so it's nice to come here where‑‑ this golf course, you've still got to play good golf and hit good shots and get it close to the hole.   
But it's a lot of fun and there's a lot of birdies out there.   I'm happy with where I'm at right now and I'm looking forward to coming back in the morning and playing better.  
   
 Q.   I take it you enjoyed the company with Martin Kaymer, and the crowds, and Henrik Stenson?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it was great.   The fans were really supportive and a budge were out there watching.  
   
 Q.   What constitutes success this week?   A win?   A good performance?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Just putting myself in contention all the time to have a chance to win.
