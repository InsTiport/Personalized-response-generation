Q. A lot of low scores out there today, but you weren't able to make a charge. How come?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit it, I thought I hit it beautifully today, just hit a lot of good putts, just nothing went in the hole. I mean, every hole it seemed like I had a really good look at it, but couldn't get anything to go. And then pulled my drive on 11 just a little bit, didn't hit it that bad, it just went too far, went down in the bushes and ended up making double on 11. That was really kind of the only, my only bad hole all day. I had good looks on every hole it felt like, just, I don't know, burning the edges all day long. 

Q. What do you have to do tomorrow to get it in the hole and not on the edges?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just keep doing exactly what I'm doing. I'm hitting good putts, I'm hitting them where I want to, it's just, it just burned the edges today, wouldn't go in. But it looks like I'm going to be a long way back tomorrow, but you never know. 

Q. How do you approach that, knowing Patrick's put up that number, there's a bunch of people in front of you?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people in front of me, a lot of really good golfers, but still need to go out tomorrow and shoot a really low score.

Q. What do you make of what Patrick's done to this point?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: He's obviously playing really well. It's pretty simple. He's playing good. Making a lot of putts. Something I'm not doing.
