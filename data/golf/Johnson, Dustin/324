DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit a pretty good number with a 3-wood.
Q. Guys going deep out there, receptive greens.  How deep are you going to have to go to lift that trophy once more?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, you never know, but I would say probably if the conditions stay like they did today, you know it's going to be 20-under.
Obviously the course is in perfect condition.  There was no wind.  The greens are perfect and they are soft.  So you've got to make birdies.  It's just when you know you hit it close, you've got to roll in the putts because the greens are so good.
Q. Just talk about being back here, a place you won, how comfortable you feel on this golf course and why.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, it's a great golf course.  I think it's a good layout.  It fits me pretty well.  You hit a lot of drivers.  The fairways, I feel like they are fairly narrow but I seem to drive it fairly well, fairly straight out here.
I'm just comfortable, got good lines on the tees, and then the greens are just perfect.  So if you hit good shots and you've got makeable putts, you can make a lot of putts if you're rolling it well out here.  It's a fun golf course to play, a lot of drivable holes, reachable par 5s, and so I just enjoy playing.
Q. You've won two WGCs before.  It's some of the best fields in golf.  Talk about stacking up against the competition that you see these kind of events.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, you've got pretty much the Top-50 players in the world, except for maybe a couple.  But it's a great field, great event.  HSBC does a great job.  It's a world-class event for sure, and then obviously with a world-class field.
