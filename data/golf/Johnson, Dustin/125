Q. Seven birdies, one of the highlights, the near ace?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I knew it was on a really good line.  You couldn't really see the hole with the way the sun was in our eyes, but yeah, you could tell by the reaction of the crowd that for a second, I thought it was in but everyone got their hands in, so I knew it had to be close.  Yeah, almost an ace.
Q. Still, the seven birdies, you did have the hiccup, the triple-bogey on 17.  Do you leave the golf course thinking, what if?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, because I mean, it didn't happen.  So there's no what ifs.
I mean, it was a good round.  I played solid.  The front side, I drove it really badly but I got away with it.  I hit some good shots, and when I did have a shot, I felt like I took advantage of it, but I was playing out of the rough.
Then 17, I just hit a God awful shot.  I haven't hit -- I don't know, I haven't hooked a driver in a long time, and that was -- I was trying to hit a high cut and I hit a low hook.  Yeah, it got me in trouble there.
Other than that, I was pleased with the round.  Hit some good shots and rolled in some good putts.  4-under is a good score around here.
