 Q.  You're in a weird spot here.  Behind us Kiradech and Robert Streb are going at it.  You need them to halve to advance or if one of them wins, do a face off with them in a playoff.  What are you trying to do and what are you trying to root for?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, it really doesn't matter.  A half would be nice and I get to go on.  But if not, we go to a playoff on No. 1.  So whoever wins, let's go.   
 Q.  How did you play in your match today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I played really well.  Jimmy played great, too.  It was a tough match.  We both made a lot of birdies.  Jimmy made one bogey on 10 and that was all.  It was just a bunch of birdies.  It was a tough fought match all day.   
 Q.  I thought you and Jimmy both played great in this match.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: We did.  We both played really well.  Both played solid.  Had a lot of looks at birdies all day.  I think Jimmy made one bogey on 10.  But other than that it was all birdies.  We halved a bunch of holes on the back with birdies.  Neither one of us gave anything away.  We both played really solid.  It was just a tough, tough, hard fought match.  And unfortunately I made a great putt on 16, after he was in there in the leather.  So that was just how it goes.  I was happy to make that one.   
 Q.  You had to win.  So now you're at least in a playoff, but you may not.  Are you going to stand around and watch Kiradech and Robert play this hole?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  Whatever happens, happens.  It's all right with me.  I'm ready to go to a playoff if need be.
