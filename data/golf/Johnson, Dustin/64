Q. Talk about your match?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Definitely you look at the board. Got off to a good start and the guys are playing really well. For me, it was just important to go out and try to get my point.
Yeah, I played really well today. I hit the ball great. Other than two shots off the tee with my 3-iron that I missed, and you know, ended up giving him a hole. Other than that, I played really, really solid, and obviously he struggled just a little bit. I definitely put lot of pressure on him because I hit some great shots today.
