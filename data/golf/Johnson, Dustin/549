  Q. When you go into a tournament like this and look at the par-5s do you say that's where you've got to make some noise?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You've got to excel on the par-5s here.   
  
  Q. Looked like a long drive contest on several holes there.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, he hits it a long way. I don't try to hit it by him. But I drove it okay. I just hit two poor ones, and I'm not disappointed at all. Going to go work a little bit on the range, but I'm still feeling good, confident, and a good round tomorrow and I'm right there in it.  
  
  Q. And this being your second year, did it feel any different on the first tee as opposed to last year?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Not much, no. You're still excited to get started and feeling good walking up to the first tee. A little nervous.  
  
  Q. You were in the British last year and you're chasing Tom Watson again. Are you getting tired of trying to catch that guy yet?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it's good to see him up there. What a good round he played today, because the course is not playing easy today. You've got to hit a lot of good shots.   
 But I mean, I'm pleased with my round.  
  
  Q. When the wind started picking up did you think anything in red would be good?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, first round anything under par here I think is good. I'm not disappointed at all. I made a few mistakes, but --  
  
  Q. Is there anything you're going to work on now? Are you comfortable with the driver or are you going to do some work on it?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm comfortable. A few bad swings. You're going to make some bad swings.  
  
  Q. What was your best swing?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit a pretty good one on 16, hit it to about six inches. They said it came right across the front edge.  
  
  Q. What did you hit there?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just a little chip 8-iron from 66 or something like that.   
  
  Q. Give me a couple of your birdies. You birdied 11 and 12. Tell me how you did those.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, 11, hit two really good shots, hit my driver on the fairway and then a 4-iron about eight feet right behind the hole.   
 And then 12, I hit 9-iron to about ten feet just left and made it.  
  
  Q. What did you have coming in on 11?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit 4-iron 215 or something.  
  
  Q. It's into the wind today?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Going into the wind.  
  
  Q. Good birdie today, huh?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was a great birdie. 11 and 12 were really good birdies.   
  
  Q. But you're in all you're pretty happy and pleased and excited about what you can do tomorrow?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  
  
  Q. 13 and 14 last year, did that come into your mind standing on the tee on 13?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I think it always does. If hit a good drive there you'll have a chance to -- you've got to hit two good shots. You've got to hit a really good tee ball and then a good second shot, especially that flag today is difficult, very difficult. It wasn't easy, that's for sure.  
  
  Q. It was a little windy there for you, but as far as just getting done, or potentially, we don't know what's going to happen, it could get nasty out here, do you feel fortunate to have had the tee time you did?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Absolutely. Any time you can finish a round that's good.
