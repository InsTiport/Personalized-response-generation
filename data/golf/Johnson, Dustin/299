 Q.  I thought you played better than that.  How would you describe today's round?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  Again, it's kind of like yesterday, just I played a lot better than my score.  You know, I was playing pretty well.  I mean making bogey and double on last two holes from the middle of the fairway is not a very good finish.  Just bad swings.   
You know, I felt like I'm playing really well.  I got a lot of confidence in my game.  You know, this golf course, just need to go out and shoot another good score tomorrow.   
 Q.  Tell us about No. 10.  You hit that 3 metal about 350 into the water.  Did that shock you a little bit, that was kind of a bogey that was unexpected I'm sure?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I didn't think I was going to get to the water.  I mean it happens, so -- you know, I wasn't disappointed about that.  Little more disappointed with the shots on the last two holes.   
But, overall, I mean I hit a lot of great shots.  You know, just need to go out tomorrow and get off to a good start and post another good number.   
 Q.  Dustin, when you look at the way you played, you played so well.  Do you allow yourself to focus on the good swings you've had without trying to dwell on what happened on last two holes?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  I mean you're going to make some bogies out here.  But from the fairway you shouldn't be making bogies.  You know, just need to get a little bit better tomorrow and -- but I feel like I'm driving it really well and swinging my irons really good.  Got to get rid of the couple misses.   
 Q.  Can you talk about 2012 when you won here and started the weekend 5 back?  Does that give you any confidence even though you're disappointed with the way you finished?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: If I can shoot two good scores on the weekend I'll be right there on Sunday.  I mean I think Dan was at 9-under.  He's got the lead.  Tomorrow, just go out and, you know, try to shoot as low as I can again and see what happens.
