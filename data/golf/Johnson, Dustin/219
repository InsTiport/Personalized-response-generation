Q. The World No. 1, Dustin Johnson, five birdies, two bogies today.  How do you describe a challenge posting a score in these conditions?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was really difficult today.  The wind was blowing hard and it was gusty so it was very difficult to judge the wind, I thought.
My short game was pretty good today.  I made some nice saves.  Hitting good shots, too.  Just ended up in, you know, bad spots but made some nice saves there to keep the round going and yeah, I thought it played very difficult.
Q. Especially 17 and 18 was crucial par saves.
Will you describe the difficulty of the up and down, especially on 17?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  I mean it was on the down slope short-sided so fortunately I had the wind with me, put some spin on it.  Hit a great chip to get it to about 8 feet and made a nice putt.
Q. As well as you've been playing over the last year, really you weren't that happy with your result at The Players Championship, what do you feel like you have to cleanup to get your fourth win in six starts?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I need to be a little more consistent with irons.  Last week I didn't really do anything that well.  Obviously I played well on Sunday, I had it going a little bit on Saturday.  But I mean there's some signs that things are going to happen.
Q. Four Top-10s here, a couple of Top-20s as well.  Why does your game fit this golf course so well?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know.  I just like the golf course.  The greens are really good so if you can get good reads on them you can make a lot of putts and, you know, you got to hit good golf shots if you want to make birdies.
