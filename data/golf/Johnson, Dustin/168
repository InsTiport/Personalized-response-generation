Q. How do you evaluate the week?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was okay.  You know, had one good day on Friday, but other than that, it was just okay.  A little bit off.  Just made a few too many mistakes, really.  But all in all, I mean, it was a solid week I guess.  Just wasn't -- didn't have my best stuff, that's for sure.
Q. Exciting time for you, you're defending some pretty big tournaments coming up in your schedule.  What are you most looking forward to and where do you feel your game is heading into this lovely stretch?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel like my game is in good shape.  Do a little practice, got two weeks off, so I'll get a little practice in and get ready for Pebble.  I have Pebble and L.A., my next two events.  So get ready for those.  Both tournaments, I really like the golf courses and I really like the event, so definitely looking forward to that.
Q. Last year, runner-up to Tommy Fleetwood, and you played alongside him for the first two days.  He is our European No. 1.  What is it about his game that most impresses you having played with him and do you feel like he's going to be up there contending with you to take the top spot?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think he's just got a good all around game.  Drives it pretty well.  Has a good short game.  There's really nothing that -- he does everything pretty well, so I think that's what makes him a good player.
