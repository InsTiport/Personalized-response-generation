Q. You had the eagle early, did you find it hard to catch any momentum?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I felt like I got off to -- I had some good looks there starting early, just struggled there a little bit on 6, 7 and 8, 9 kind of a little bit, but just missed a few short putts, that was all.  All in all it was an okay day, 1-under around here is not terrible, but definitely left a lot of shots out there.
Q. 1-under and you're still 7-under and in contention.  Does it feel good going into the weekend?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Absolutely, I think I'm in a good position.  Tomorrow I need to come out and shoot a really solid score, but I feel like I'm in a good spot leading into the weekend.
Q. Are you surprised the number that Webb put up?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, yeah, that's a really good score around here.  Absolutely.
Q. Did you think that was gettable today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean --
Q. He got to 11-under -- at some point he was at 11-under.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean the golf course -- who knows.  I mean every golf course you can shoot really low scores, but you have to play incredibly well.  But, yeah, that's pretty special around here and these conditions.  I felt like, especially this afternoon, the greens firmed up a little bit, they got really fast, so it was tricky to get it close to the holes and obviously he putted very well.
Q. Expect them to firm up even more on the weekend?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Absolutely I do.
Q. How tough a test will that be?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Any time this golf course gets firm and fast it's definitely more of a test.
