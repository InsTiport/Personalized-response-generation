 Q.  Obviously a pretty successful day for you.  What was working for you today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Today I hit it a lot better today.  It was in the fairway.  This golf course you've got to be in the fairway.  Today I drove it a little bit better.  I holed a couple of putts.  Just really had a lot of putts to win holes, whereas yesterday I had a lot of putts to tie.   
 Q.  Is getting off to a good start really important around this golf course?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's important any day.  Getting off to a good start is definitely important.  Today I got off to a good start and kept it going.   
 Q.  What's your plan this afternoon, hit some balls, relax a little bit, because you've got another match tomorrow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Going to work on a few things and then hit the gym.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, you've got your matches, so you know who you're playing.  Tomorrow, I saw Jimmy was winning.  So we'll see.
