Q. How was it playing with one of your better friends today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it was good. We had a good day. Obviously, he had some chances there on the back nine to post a number or get a little -- for me, obviously him too, it's just tough to make putts out here. I felt like we both played good. I didn't make anything today. I mean, I made a nice putt on 11 but also missed real short ones for birdie on 12 and 16, and then the front nine I missed quite a few short ones.
But I'm swinging a lot better. My game feels a lot better. It feels pretty sharp, even though it wasn't as sharp as I'd like it to be, but it's moving in the right direction. I still felt like I was competing out there, and I had a chance today. I just needed to shoot a low number, but just hit so many good putts. It was hard for me to get them to the hole. Just the greens were rolling a little slower than they looked like. You know, I just couldn't get a grip on it. It was hard for me to get the ball to the hole, especially from outside ten feet or so.
Yeah, all in all, I'm pretty happy with the week. I'm looking forward to next week. I feel like the game's in a good spot. I'm swinging well, got a lot of confidence in the game. So looking forward to a good week next week.
Q. And what are your thoughts overall on the course? How likely are you to return?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'll be back for sure. I'm an RBC Ambassador, for one, and I love this golf course. I think it's really good. I definitely prefer it overseeded and in April. I think it plays a lot tougher. But it was -- because it generally plays firmer and faster, especially with the overseed. It's just the greens are definitely firmer and faster. So you've got to be really -- obviously, you don't see these kinds of scores being shot in the overseed. But I will definitely be back next year.
