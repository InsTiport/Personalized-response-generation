  Q. 7-under 64. Still a lot of golf to play. Pretty windy out there. Who knows what could happen.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, you know, finally today I drove it in the fairway. First time all week I hit fairways. You know, hit good iron shots, too, which I haven't been doing all week. My short game's been good, though.   
 I was probably chipping it a little earlier in the week. Finally today I hit some good shots, chipped and putted well.   
  
  Q. You're 19th or 20th in the FedExCup standings. You may not go much further forward, about you won't drop further back.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, that's huge. Especially playoff time, you can just play solid and get you through the first few rounds, you're right there at the end.   
  
  Q. Looking forward to next week with a round like that under your belt?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm looking forward to next week. Got the driver going straight. That's my biggest key.   
  
  Q. Your caddie will tell me you should have been 10-under.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I missed four-putts inside of seven feet for birdie. I mean, it was good. But I chipped in twice.   
  
  Q. That helps.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yes.
