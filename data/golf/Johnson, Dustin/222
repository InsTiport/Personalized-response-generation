Q. How tough was it out there today in terms of just trying to find a rhythm?  You got the big break on the ball going in on 11 and it was just a bunch of pars after that.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I just I didn't hit it very good, I didn't drive it well, didn't hit my irons very well, just didn't have enough looks at birdies.  And then to have a few putts lip out, it's difficult out there, but you got to drive it in the fairway.  That's the big key here.  When I did drive it in the fairway, I wasn't hitting it close to the hole, so it makes for a very frustrating day.
Q. Any particular thing you want to fix?  Seems like a lot of irons were drifting right today.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I hit everything bad, so I'm going to go to the range and practice a little bit here.  Hopefully I can figure it out and come out and shoot a good score tomorrow.  The good thing is hopefully by the end of the day I won't be too far back, and around this golf course, if I can get something going tomorrow I can get myself right back in it.
Q. What seems to bring you down lately?  Is it easy to dismiss this because the conditions are blowing so hard?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I can't blame anything on anyone but myself.  The golf course, it wasn't -- it's playing difficult, but if you hit good shots you can shoot a good score.  Good scores are out there, I just didn't play well enough to shoot a good score.
Q. Given how bunched the leaderboard is right now, do you take positives from what you were able to do on the weekend last week?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, obviously we'll see what happens by the end of the day, but I'm going to have to play two really good rounds on the weekend, but tomorrow I'll probably be teeing off pretty early and go out and post a good number and get myself back in the golf tournament.
Q. Is there a number you need to be within to be within striking distance in the tournament?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: If the lead's around 6- or 7-under, that's still within reach, absolutely.
Q. Jon Rahm mentioned the green firmness because they're new.  Is that the variable that's even adding to the difficulty?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know the greens are firm so it's not like -- it's just firm.  You play for it.  It's not like you hit one and it stops.  They all bounce.  So you just play for it.  You got to drive it in the fairway, and I didn't hit enough fairways today.
Q. How much comfort -- you almost won last week from the cut line.  It looks like you might have to do something like that here.  The break you got on the last hole, the ricochet off the railing, can you talk about that?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: That was not really a good or bad break.  It probably would have been better if it was over to the right a little bit more.  I just need to play some good golf here in the next two days.
Q. Did you guys talk about extra holes to break the tie?  You guys all three finishing at even.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was all different, too, so...
