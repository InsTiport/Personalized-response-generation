Q.   Obviously you're making the decision that you're going to give it a go this week?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I think so.   I'm going to see ‑‑ obviously go to the gym and get some work done on it tonight and in the morning.   It's going to be all right, but, as far as everything's going, everything's going really good with it, with the healing.   My knee's feeling strong.   It's better than it was last year. 
I saw Butch on Monday and we worked and my swing is as good as it's ever been and it's mostly because the knee's healthier and strong again.   Last year, it wasn't that it was bothering me, it was that it was just a little bit weak.   I wasn't, I couldn't swing just right.   So it's probably been getting better since then.

Q.   When is the first time you picked up a club after you had the surgery?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Probably two and a half weeks ago.   Three weeks ago.   Well I chipped and putted for starting after about 20 days after about three weeks just maybe two and a half weeks I started chipping and putting it.   And then I started hitting about a month after. 

Q.   And you just walked 18 yesterday for the first time?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I didn't, I actually I didn't walk 18.   I walked ‑‑ we went out and played, we played probably 16 or 17 holes and I walked probably every other hole.

Q.   Have you done a full 18 walk?   Did you do that today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I walked‑‑ well, yeah, just the last couple days I been playing on a cart, but I been just walking, kind of walking every other hole, just to stay kind of loose and loosen it up.   As far as hitting balls and doing all that stuff, it doesn't bother me, but I haven't been out there all day walking on it yet.   But I don't think it's going to be an issue.
