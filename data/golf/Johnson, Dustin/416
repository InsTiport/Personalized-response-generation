Q.   Just talk about the round today and the whole PGA overall, how you felt?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, I really played good today.   I just‑‑ the putter let me down a little bit today.   I shot 1‑under, but it felt like I shot 75.   I just missed a lot of putts. 
Other than that I'm pretty happy with the way I struck it.   I drove it really nice.   And I hit a lot of great shots, but just putted really poorly.

Q.   Do you feel it was two different courses? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, the golf course, you know, obviously no wind today kind of‑‑ I would like to see it be a little bit breezier, but the course firmed up a little bit and played really nice today.
