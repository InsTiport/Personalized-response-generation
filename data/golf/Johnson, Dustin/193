Q. There's a lot we can talk about in that duel with Jordan Spieth, 5-down, you ultimately took the lead and made a clutch par putt on the 72nd hole but everybody is going to be talking about the first playoff hole with Jordan in the fairway.  Why was it such a great shot for you to take on the water and the bunker and that small target?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was actually easier than hitting it to the right.  The first time around, I probably should have hit it there -- the fairway, I think, for me, the fairway's wider going that way.  But you know, obviously it gives me a huge advantage there, especially I hit a good drive in the fairway.  You know, I'm only coming in with a 60 where he's hitting, you know, a 7-iron or 6-iron.
So yeah, I mean, definitely advantage went to me when I hit a good drive in the fairway.  But yeah, I made a heck of a par, though, on the 72nd hole to get in the playoff and he made a really good 2-putt, too, from where he was.  But I made a nice putt when I knew he was going to make four.  I made a nice putt to get in the playoff and ultimately hit two really good shots in there to about three feet to the playoff hole.
Q. We talked after the third round, you said you like chasing the lead.  What kind of attitude did you bring to the golf course today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I said I didn't mind, but I would have a lot rather had the lead.
Q. You're not uncomfortable there.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: This golf course, though, if you drive it well and you're hitting your irons really good, you can shoot a good score.  You've kind of got to do everything very well, because even after you hit the drive in the fairway and hit a good shot, you never have an easy putt.  You know, the greens are really fast and firm.  They are undulated.  It's tough.  Every part of the game, it's tough.
But I knew I was swinging really well.  I was hitting everything very good.  I was hitting a lot of -- a lot of times I was hitting it close to the hole.  I knew it was going to be a day where I just needed to go out and do the same thing I've been doing the first three days, which is drive it in the fairway and keep giving myself good looks at birdie, and that's what I did all day today.
Feels great, it's been a tough road to get back here.  You know, I felt like obviously leading into Augusta, I was playing the best golf that I've ever played.  Really solid, steady golf.  Nothing too fancy.  Just playing really steady, which is what I did this week.  You know, I drove it good.  I hit good shots.  Never really got in trouble.  I just felt like the golf swing's finally back to where it was, so I feel like I've got control over it, I'm controlling the golf ball, controlling my distances very well, and I played really solid every day this whole week.  It was a lot of fun.
Q. You have 16 PGA TOUR wins, you've won a major championship and you've won WGCs and you're in great position to win the FedExCup for the first time in your career.  What would that mean to you?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It would mean a lot.  It's something I haven't done and it's something that I really want to win.  You know, it's tough, though, to get it done in Atlanta.  Atlanta is a really tough golf course.  Obviously I'm going to be in that top five going into Atlanta.  So you know, I kind of control my own destiny, and I'll need to; I might have to go there and win.
