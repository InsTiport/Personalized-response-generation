 Q. (No Microphone.)DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's not bad.  I played solid.  I had a lot of good chances to make birdies and just a little off with the putter.  I missed a real short one on 6, but other than that I thought that I played really solid and put myself in good spots all day.
Q. Would you have taken 2-under after 36 holes when you were done on Wednesday?  And if you would have, would you have thought it would have been eight shots behind?DUSTIN JOHNSON: I would have taken it on Wednesday.  And no, I wouldn't have thought it would be eight shots behind.
Q. Did you think it would be leading?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, you always think through Thursday, Friday, 3-, 4-, 5-under probably is going to be leading. But obviously Martin's playing very well and that 10-under's very good around here for two rounds.
Q. Has your approach changed going into Saturday so many shots down or are you trying to hope maybe he falls back?DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, this golf course is tough and you got to -- my approach won't change at all, just keep doing what I'm doing.  I've got a good game plan for this golf course and I'm going to stick to it, no matter what.  I'll just keep trying to shoot under par around here.
Q. Is tomorrow more important than usual?DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I think that -- I mean Saturday's always important to put yourself in a good position on Sunday. Tomorrow you need to come out and play solid again, and depending upon how the course is set up whether you shoot even par or a couple under, I think that will still give you a chance to win on Sunday.
Q. Have you played with Martin before?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I played a good bit with Martin.
Q. What's the best thing about his game?  What's impressed you the most?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, he's always been a really good putter.  So obviously he's making a lot of putts and to make putts you have to be hitting good shots.  So I think obviously 10-under, his score speaks for it, he's doing everything very well.
Q. How would you compare yesterday's setup to today's setup?DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought the pins were a bit more difficult today, for sure.
Q. You know what it's like to have a chance to win on Sunday.  How eager are you to get yourself back in that spot?DUSTIN JOHNSON: I want to be there every week.  It's always a good feeling, you know you're playing well, you got a lot of confidence, especially when you're right up there by the lead. After two days today, after two days this week, I'm really comfortable with where I'm at and just need to keep doing what I'm doing.
Q. What was going on with your stroke there on 6?DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's just something I do for practice.  Nothing's going wrong.  My stroke feels really good.  I'm just -- I just hit a bad putt, you can't hit them all good.
Q. Is it more about your play this week or more about the course?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm just playing better.  The last two Opens -- and the golf course.  The last two, I wasn't particularly a big fan of the last two.  You know, great golf courses, just didn't suit me.
Q. Having shot 82 yourself on Sunday at the U.S. Open, if you're in a spot where you're several behind does that increase your eagerness or does it help your patience?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, anything can happen.  As you all know, anything can happen in a U.S. Open.  It's not -- this golf course is tough.  If you get just a little bit off with your driver and your irons, you're going to have a long day. So I just need to -- I've got a good game plan, I'm going to stick to it.  If I keep hitting it like I am then I'm going to keep shooting good scores.
Q. (No Microphone.)DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I'll take any Major.  If you're off at all at any of them, you're going to have a tough time.
Q. Is the game plan affected at all by the deficit or do you just not think about what Martin's doing?DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I can only control what I'm doing, not what he's doing.
Q. Does Martin Kaymer ever talk at all about 2010 and Whistling Straits and how that all fell out?DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.
Q. I mean, he kind of benefited from your misfortune there?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, well, no, we never talked about it.
Q. (No Microphone.)DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, they're fine.  I think the golf course looks great.  When you hit it in there, it's either you get a good lie or you don't.  And I've had two where I've had to chip out, but other than that, I've had decent looks at it from in those areas.
Q. How many drivers did you hit today?DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm not real sure, but I hit -- let's see, there's 14 -- I don't know, probably 10.
