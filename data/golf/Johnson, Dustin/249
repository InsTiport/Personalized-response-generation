 Q.  4-under today, 15 for the tournament.  Just your thoughts with how the week went and are you happy with the way you played?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm happy the way I played.  I struggled on the greens, though, this week.  I didn't make any putts.  You know, I played pretty well.  I had a lot of chances.  I could have easily been right there.  I did not put it.  I putted well.  Just nothing went in the hole.   
I lipped-out of maybe 12 or 13 putts, at least, like pretty bad lip-outs.  But overall, you know, I'm happy with the way I played.  I thought I played really well.  You know, just missed a lot of putts.   
 Q.  Thoughts on the conditions out there today?  Wind kind of changed a little bit.  I thought the back nine might have been a little tougher.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's a little different direction.  But the golf course, the golf course is in great shape considering what they had to work with.  I just didn't execute on the greens this week.  But yeah, the wind definitely switched directions.   
 Q.  When do we see you again?  What's your schedule now, the next month, two months?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Playing Abu Dhabi next, and then possibly Torrey and then Pebble and L.A.   
 Q.  I'm sure your father-in-law will be out watching?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Sure, he'll be out some.  He's going to play with me at Pebble, so that will be fun.
