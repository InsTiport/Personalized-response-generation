Q. Comments on your opening round.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I thought I played really solid.  Made, I kind of gave away two shots there on 15 and 16.  Just one, bad swing with the driver, and the other one I just misjudged the distance a little bit with a wedge shot.  I actually thought I hit a good shot and it came up about 10 yards short of where I wanted it to and ended up making bogey there on 16.  But -- or on 15.  And then 16 I hit a driver left and into the stuff.  That was the only, probably worst swing I made all day.  Overall I felt like I played good.  Had a lot of good chances at birdies.  Just it's tough to make putts out here.
Q. More so than the other courses?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think so.  I've always struggled.
Q. But are you happy with the score you start with?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I think that's probably my best score here.  So, yeah, I'm happy with it.  I mean around this course I think 5-under for me is playing good.
Q. Shooting 59.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: For me.  Usually I shoot about even so I'm happy with it, even though it should have been a lot better, but I mean I'm okay.
Q. Seemed like you were able to console the commissioner after his round.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I saw how he did.  He said he had trouble on the greens today, but that's, he's not the only one.
