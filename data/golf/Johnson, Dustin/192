DUSTIN JOHNSON: Jordan is a tough competitor.  He played really well all day.  I felt like I played really good today.  Just the front nine, I could not hold a putt.  I hit really good putts the whole time, just burning the edges all day.  It was nice in the playoff here, the wind kind of switched and I could cover the water.  It was a little bit easier coming in with a 60-degree on 18.  I hit a great shot in there to three feet.
Q. You spent 30 minutes extra time yesterday working on your wedges.  How important was that given the choice you made at 18 to lay up and get into the playoff?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It happened to me yesterday, too, on 14, when I drove it just in the rough.  I just chipped out sideways to a number that I knew.  I had a good number and I know I'm swinging it well, especially hitting my wedges very good.  Just laid up on 18 to where I had 200-hole or something, so I had about 195 or something the first time around.  Actually thought I hit a better shot than I did but I holed a really nice putt to get myself in the Playoffs.
Q. What are you expecting now in the playoffs?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm expecting to play very well.  I feel like the game is finally back in form like it was leading into the Masters.  I feel like I'm swinging everything really well.  Got a lot of control over the golf ball.  I'm feeling really good.  Obviously getting the win here today gives me a lot of confidence going into next week and the rest of the Playoffs.
Q. Going forward, where do you think you need to improve?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I think right now, I just need to keep doing what I'm doing.  I feel like everything's working pretty well.  Keep working hard on my wedge game.  Because if I drive it in the fairway, I get a lot of wedges and that's where I can score.  I feel like just continue to work on those and hopefully keep driving it as good as I am.
Q. What were you thinking when you were 5-down going to the sixth hole?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I knew I'm playing really good.  I was hitting it great, even through the first five holes.  I just missed some really short putts.  I didn't hit any bad putts.  I didn't hit a bad putt all day long.  Hit them all right where I'm looking and burned the edge a few times, and Jordan holed a few.  I knew this golf course, if I kept hitting it like I was, kept driving it in the fairway, that I was going to make some birdies, and I did.
You know, obviously made a really good 4 on 18 to get in the playoff, and then the next time around, I learned from the first time.  I should never have gone right the first time around because I can cover the water.  Hit a great drive down there and obviously hit a great 60 in there to about two feet and made it.
Q. After what went on at the Masters, what's it feel like to win again on the PGA TOUR?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It feels good, real good, especially because I was playing so well leading into Augusta.  Obviously when I slipped and fell and hurt my back, it's been a struggle to get back to where I belong and where I feel like I should be, which is contending in golf tournaments and playing really good golf.
This week I did that.  I finally got back.  Finally feel like my swing was back to where it was before Augusta.  I felt like I had complete control over the golf ball.  I mean, I think my scores show it.  I didn't hole a lot of putts this week.  Obviously I holed some when it counted, which is the big thing, but I hit a lot of good putts.  But I really drove it and hit the ball very well.  I think I only made four bogeys all week, which is -- around this golf course, is pretty darned good.
Q. How much fun was that for you out there?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Jordan is a great player.  It was a tough day but I feel like even on the front nine, I hit the ball really, really well.  A lot of great shots and a lot of good looks at birdie.  Hit a lot of good putts.  Just didn't go in.  But I did make it when they counted there on 18.  It was down little, breaking right-to-left, and felt like it wasn't going to turn but finally went in.
