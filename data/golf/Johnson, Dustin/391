  JOHN BUSH:   We'd like to welcome Dustin Johnson into the interview room the after 2‑over par 74, 1‑under par for the tournament.   Dustin, quite a day out there, if we can just get some comments on your round and how difficult conditions were. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I thought I played pretty well.   Didn't really get much out of my round but you know, finished pretty poorly.   I hit some good shots but it's just tough.   Hit a good shot on 15 that went in the water. 
The golf course is playing really tough right now and especially with the conditions, it's so windy, the greens are really firm and fast and that makes for a tough golf course. 

Q.   Growing up along the Carolina coast, did that help you with the wind today? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, I mean, playing over the last seven years on TOUR, we play in a lot of different conditions.   So I've always enjoyed it when it's tough.   I like these conditions.   It definitely‑‑ you've got to play really good golf, hit the ball great, and hole short putts‑‑ I missed a short one on 18, but   you get good bounces, you get bad ones.   Out here if you don't hit it perfect, it doesn't come out very good.   But yeah, just frustrating.   I was a little frustrated 18, thought I hit the right club and the right shot.

Q.   A lot of fans would love to see conditions like this because they like to see you guys have to be creative and things like that.   Obviously it's no fun when you're struggling but when you're done with the round, is there any sense of enjoyment from you that it tested you in that way? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, like I was saying, I really like the conditions here.   I like it playing hard.   You know, being 1‑under par and tied for the lead, that says something about the conditions and also the golf course. 
This golf course, Trump did a great job and I think that with the re‑design it made it a lot tougher and then also these conditions, no matter what golf course you're playing, it's going to play tough. 

Q.   A lot of the guys who finished earlier said that the official the who set it up, knowing the conditions were going to be this tough, should have made it a lot easier.   How do you feel about that? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I mean, I don't think it was a bad setup.   I think there was maybe a couple holes that they could have moved the tee up a little bit on.   But other than that, I thought they did a good job with the setup as far as conditions.   They put some tough ones out there, but I don't think it‑‑ it doesn't matter where you put it on these greens.   It's going to be tough. 

Q.   Did the wind change a lot or switch a lot out there? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, it was concisely blowing hard in one direction.   It didn't really‑‑ you know, you would get some gusts that would come up.   It was blowing extremely hard but it blue in the same direction the whole time. 

Q.   When you play in wind like this say the British? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I've played in a lot stronger winds than this.

Q.   What shots did you hit today that turned out good, if there was one? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   That turned out good?   I don't know‑‑ No. 5, I hit a good drive down the left‑hand side and I had probably 60 yards and I hit a little like 54, one hop, skipped and ran on to the green about three feet.   That was probably the best shot. 

Q.   It's a little clichÃ© when condition get like this, that the game becomes more mental than physical.   Do you find that to be true and can you explain it, if so? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   You've got to stay patient and you've got to hit the right shots so you really have to think your way around the golf course when conditions are like this.   You have to be creative and you definitely have to stay in the middle‑‑ because you're going to hit a shot that is going to do something you don't like, and it can frustrate you a little bit.   But you've just got to remember that the golf course is playing hard and you're not the only one it's happening to. 

Q.   The 13th hole, did the renovation improve that hole?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, the 13th hole was good.   Today it was 225 dead into the wind so didn't matter what they did, it was going to play hard. 
The new hole, I think they made the green a lot bigger, a lot wider, so it's definitely easier to hit the green.
