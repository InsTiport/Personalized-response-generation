  DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I played better today.   I putted a little better.   Even though I had two 3‑putts, I still putted a little better.   Yesterday, I just putted really bad.   I had like four 3‑putts yesterday or something.   But played better, much better today.   I hit it better and played the par 5s a little better, even though I parred 7, which was not very good.   
   
 Q.   Overall, have you enjoyed your time here in Perth?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I really enjoyed it.   It's been very nice.   You know, everyone's been really‑‑ all the fans and everything, have been great.   I've really enjoyed my time here.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you might be keen to come back if IMG come knocking again next year?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, if they do I'll definitely come back.   I liked it.   I like the golf course and it's definitely a place I would come back to.   
   
 Q.   How do you think the golf course compares to other courses around the world?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I mean, it's very similar.   It holds up just fine.   I've played golf courses everywhere and this one is just as good as all of them.
