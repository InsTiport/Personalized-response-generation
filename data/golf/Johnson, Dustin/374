Q.   4‑under par today, and we were just talking about how difficult these greens are, but 26 putts is really good when you take a look at Riviera?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, my short game was really good today.   When I was up close to the green, I chipped it close to the hole.   So I didn't really have any long putts for par.   I had a lot of tap‑ins, which is nice. 
But I hit a lot of great shots.   Had a couple‑‑ made two bogeys, and both those putts were probably eight, nine feet, because they are just tough to make.   The greens are so fast and have got a lot of slope in them.   So it's hard to get it in the hole.   I had quite a few good looks at birdie.   Just hit good putts, burned the edges.

Q.   We talked about how important experience is here at Riviera, when you come here year‑in, year‑out, what are the things that maybe you learn more and execute better? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   You just know, sometimes even with a wedge, you just can't attack flags.   That's the hard part about being here, especially when the greens are firm.   You've got to play away from a lot of flags and try to use the slopes to get it close. 
But you know, I played really solid today, and hopefully go out tomorrow and do the same thing.   I drove it great.   I hit it well and putted well.

Q.   New father to baby, Tatum‑‑ he's not here, I asked; but how is it being a first‑time father?   It has to be amazing. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It is amazing.   He's doing awesome.   Mom's doing awesome.   They are here this week, just not out here.
