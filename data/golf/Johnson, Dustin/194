 Q.  If we can get some comments on your round, please?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I got off to a good start right out of the gate on the first hole.  Made a nice 25-footer on the first hole.  Got the day started off nicely.  Then, you know, just kind of kept it rolling from there.   
The conditions were quite difficulty thought.  The wind's blowing pretty hard out there and it definitely made it tough.  I drove it really well today and hit some really nice iron shots.  Put together a pretty good score.   
 Q.  Can you describe the second shot into 18?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I had 205 front, I think 220 hole.  You know, wind is down off the left.  I hit, you know, it was a 6-iron.  It was a perfect 6-iron for me.  Getting a little bit of help there.  I just hit a really nice shot.   
 Q.  Where did you wind up on 12 and how did you get that far?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know.  The wind's in out the right there.  And I just -- I was just hitting a little chip, caught up against the wind over on the left side of the fairway.  I thought it would be ten yards shorter into the fairway and it ended up down the hill.   
 Q.  Did you get a good break there?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know what -- no, it wasn't a great lie.  Ball was way below my feet.  But hit a pretty good shot to get it on the front edge of the green there.  But yeah, it's a great golf hole.   
 Q.  When you get on a run like this, does it feel like week-to-week, it's almost the same tournament, coming off what happened Sunday, and playing well again today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  We're in a different place, different golf course.   
But the golf game is what's more important to me, is feeling the same every day.  I feel like -- I finally feel like I'm swinging the club how I was, you know, when I was playing really well at the beginning of the year.  I've got a lot of control over it.  I feel like I can control my golf ball very well, which is what you've got to do in these conditions.   
 Q.  You've got a very good track record, the weeks after you win.  Is there anything, or a secret to keeping that momentum going?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, when you win, you're playing well.  So it gives you a lot of confidence.  For me, that was one thing that was probably lacking a little bit the last few months is just the confidence, just because I wasn't seeing the shots that I wanted to see.  I wasn't consistently hitting them.  So the confidence was just down a little bit.   
But you know, after last week, obviously I've got a lot of confidence now.  I feel like the things I've been working on, they are back to working.   
You know, I'm feeling good, so I think that's a big key for me.   
 Q.  Is the hole looking bigger, or does it look less small?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it always looks small.   
 Q.  The way conditions are out there, do you foresee that someone might have a lower score this afternoon?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I couldn't tell you that, but yeah, it's definitely possible for sure.  Because I feel like I left a few out there.   
 Q.  How cool was it, the weather, teeing off?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was cool this morning.  I don't know the temperature, but it was cold, I know that.   
 Q.  Do you remember the last time you felt that cool teeing off?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: West Coast.  Pretty much every tournament on the West Coast it's cold.
