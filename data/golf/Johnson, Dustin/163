 Q. Let me start, there's a thing‑‑ there's what they call your position is "lurking." Everybody talks about everyone else, you're minus 3, currently four shots back, how do you feel about your position?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel like I'm in a good position. Even the guys on the golf course, there's some birdie holes out there. The conditions are tough, so you're going to have to play a good solid round to get it in‑‑ Pat's at 7‑under. Good finish would be to stay at 7. Obviously it could go either way. But I feel like I'm in a good spot going into tomorrow.   
   
 Q. Talk about the par 5s. Was 16 key?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit a great shot in there off the tee and I gave myself a really good look at birdie. Thought I hit a pretty good putt, hit the hole, just hit it a fraction too hard, went down the hill. But very nice to make that putt coming back up to the hill.  
   
 Q. Talk about the par 5s.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean I played the par‑5s well. I was on the green in 15 and 2 and ended up 3‑putting. That was kind of really the only stumble I had today other than 5. I bogeyed 5, but I hit a great drive, and I hit a really good second shot, it just went over the green. And it's a tough chip from there. Other than that I definitely played the par‑5s very well today.   
   
 Q. (Inaudible.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, you know, just hit a nice drive off the tee, and left myself‑‑ you've got to hit that fairway. And had a really good number at 139 adjusted hole. And hit a really nice sand wedge in there to five feet.  
   
 Q. Is there great satisfaction where you are right now after last year?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, that was a year ago. At this point I don't even think about it. But, yeah, I'm definitely happy to be back here. Always a pleasure to come here to Augusta. And to put two pretty good rounds together is even better, leading into the weekend.  
   
 Q. Will you do anything special tonight to get ready for tomorrow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, just go‑‑ whatever the weather is for tomorrow, we've got to play in it, that's okay with me. The tougher the better.
