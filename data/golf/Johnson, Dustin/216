START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT








Q. Dustin Johnson, a bit of a rough day for you today.  A little bit uncharacteristic.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I started on the greens a little bit today.  I felt like I was hitting good putts.  My speed was a little bit off.  I was hitting it a little too hard on the high side of the hole or not hitting it hard enough to catch it low.  I played good.
Q. This is only your third event back after the injury at Augusta.  How would you say you are mentally and physically in terms of getting back to where you want to be?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Mentally I'm fine.  Physically I'm fine, too.  Just, you know, I'm not as sharp as I was, obviously, you know, before the Masters but it's going to take a little time to get back in that kind of rhythm but I'm seeing good signs.  Just going to keep working on it.
Q. In that case, you know, we always like to focus on what's happening good, let the bad take care of itself.  How are you going to approach tomorrow?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean I got to go out and be aggressive and try to get you a low number.  There's some good scores to be shot out here at this golf course.  I felt like I'm hitting it good enough, if I can roll some putts in tomorrow I'll shoot a really low number.
