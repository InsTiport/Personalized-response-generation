Q. 63 for you on Friday, 68 today.  How would you compare today's round to yesterday?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought I played pretty solid today.  It was pretty tough, the wind was blowing pretty hard and a little bit different direction, made the par-5s play a little bit tougher.  Then with all the rain we got last night, I felt that I struggled with the speed a little bit early in the round and I kept leaving everything a little bit short.  But I got a pretty good handle on it on the back nine and finished off really nicely.
Q. A lot of attention has been focused on your putting, the switch to the new putter, after a few rounds competitively, how would you rate your confidence as you stand over the ball on the green right now?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's really good.  I felt like I'm seeing the lines really well out here, I feel like I got pretty good speed, and the putter is working.  It's just going where I'm looking, which is the only thing I look for.  I mean, I feel like I read the greens very well, so just feel like I'm making some putts this week.
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, you have a three-shot lead going into the final round, how do you attack this golf course now with that cushion over the competition?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm not going to change anything.  Just play it the same way I've been playing it.  I feel like I got a good game plan out here and I'll be aggressive on flags when I feel like I got a good club and a good number and other times there's a few holes out here you just want to make par on and keep on going.
