TOM BENBOW: We welcome back our defending champion, Dustin Johnson to the Saudi International. The current world No. 5 was victorious last year with a total score of 19-under par.
Dustin, how does it feel to be back?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm feeling good. I'm really pleased with how I played last year, and I'm excited to be back in Saudi Arabia for this tournament.
TOM BENBOW: You've defended a trophy once before in your career. Do you think about that coming into an event as defending champion?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Any time you've won somewhere, yeah, you're looking at it, but every event that I go to, whether I've won there or not, I'm always trying to win it.
But you know, it's more like the process. Like I want to get myself in contention. I just want to give myself a chance to win on Sunday. I feel like if I can put myself in a position to have a chance to win going into the back nine on Sunday, then I've done what I wanted to do that week, and you know, just see what I can do those last nine holes.
TOM BENBOW: Have you had any chance to look at how the course has developed since last year?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I have not been on the course today. I am going to get out there right after this press conference and get on the golf course.
TOM BENBOW: One more from me before I send it out to the floor. Aside from being back, you're obviously depending your title. Was there anything about Saudi Arabia that made you want to come back, anything you did off the course, or any other reason?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, last year, met a friend that lived here and took us out on a SCUBA dive, and then so that was something I was looking forward to doing again this year. So we went out this morning and did another dive, which was really nice. It's beautiful, the Red Sea.
Q. How do you assess last season as a whole, and what are the goals for this year?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Last season was okay. You know, definitely didn't play quite as well as I would have liked to, especially towards the end of the year.
This year, I'm looking forward to having a big year. I feel like the game, it's in pretty good form. Obviously I haven't played much since Atlanta, but I had surgery in the off-season, so I'm just kind of getting back into it. Everything feels really good, and I'm excited about this year.
Q. What let you down last year towards the end?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think it was a little bit of everything. I don't think there was just one specific thing. I think everything was just okay. It wasn't good enough.
Q. What's the wisest thing you've ever heard from your friends about being a defending champion? You may have listened to Tiger, or anything on the subject. What have you picked up?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I have no idea. But you know, obviously being a defending champion comes with, you know, there's -- you have a little more obligations, but you know, just managing your time and stuff with those obligations.
You know, just still understanding just because you won at a golf course, too, it doesn't mean you're going to win again. You're going to have to work for it.
Q. The other thing I wanted to know is what did you see under the Red Sea?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: We actually saw a shipwreck. It was a really neat dive. All kind of fish, sting Rays. Pretty much what you see anywhere a lot of places in the world when you're diving.
Q. Sharks?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No sharks today.
Q. Was it an old ship?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was. It was a hundred years old, I think, from what I was told.
Q. Such tragic news coming out of the states on the weekend. Did you ever meet Kobe in your golf career, and can you share with us your thoughts? Devastating news.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, he was a great ambassador of the game. You know, he was an idol to a lot of people, including me. I grew up watching him play basketball, and you know, just kind of everything he did. I thought it's definitely tragic news.
I did get to meet him. I actually was on a phone call with him not too long ago because we're both involved -- well, he was one of the main investors in Body Armor, which is one of my sponsors. So we were on a call not too long ago.
Yeah, it just tragic news.
Q. Some reports over the weekend about a proposed Premiere Golf League. Can you ask if you've had any contact about what your thoughts are?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Obviously, of course, I've heard of it. I think it's in the early stages, but sounds interesting.
Q. Would you require some reassurances that if you were to go for that, you could go back to the PGA Tour, or is there anything that you need to hear from them that would convince you to go with it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think everything is in the early stages right now. So it's kind of hard to say.
Q. When you say it "sounds interesting," what part of it -- well, let's just go the other way. What would it take for you to basically lose your card and go play somewhere else?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I don't know if that's even a possibility, but it would take a lot.
Q. When you say "a lot," financially, or some other way?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think probably in every way you could think of.
Q. That being said, could you see 48 guys go that way?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, it's possible for sure. I think so.
Q. Has there been any contact from the PGA Tour to the players since the start of the weekend.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: From what I was told, I got an e-mail recently. I haven't read it yet. Probably read it right after this.
Q. Tell us about it after that?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Sure (laughter) you'll be my first call.
Q. Last week Sebastian SÃ¶derberg played the fastest round of golfer on The European Tour. Did you see any of that online?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I did not, but I do know Sebastian.
Q. He played in 1 hour, 36 minutes, he was just running around?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: What did he shoot?
Q. 75?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: That's not too bad for playing that fast.
Q. What do you think of his decision to do that, and if you did find yourself on the first group on Sunday, would that cross your mind to go out and do that, too?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No. Well, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't be running. But I'd probably play very quickly, especially if I was first out on Sunday. Probably wouldn't -- yeah, I wouldn't like being first out on a Sunday. So yeah, I'd probably play pretty fast, kind of like he did. Maybe not that quick.
Q. Do you think that could -- say somebody goes lower than him, do you think that might build a bit of excitement, guys might start talking about it and wanting to go lower and it might become a thing?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't think so. But maybe some guys want to have that record. But it's not one I'm looking for.
Q. I have actually two concerns, my question. Maybe you're not the right guy to ask. Is there any specific type of fitness, able to play this sport? It's a new sport in Saudi Arabia and nobody knows about the requirements to play this game. That's the first one. Second, I used to be a billiard champion, and once I started playing, actual lifting weights and going to the gym, all my shots were shifted and I had to re-design all my shots again. Is it the same that applies to this kind of sport; that if you start playing -- lifting weights or playing a different kind of sport, you need to readjust all your shots?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I don't think so. There's not a specific body type, either. If you look at the guy who is play, you know, there's not a specific body type. And then also, lifting weights and playing, as long as you're still -- if you're doing the right things, you know, I think if you just go to the gym and just lift weights, it could definitely hinder your game. But as long as you're doing the right things in the gym and you continue to stretch and swing while you're training, which is something that I do a lot, then it hasn't really affected me. If anything, it's helped.
Q. Pretty jam-packed season this year with the Olympics, The Ryder Cup. How important is it to get that schedule right? And is the goals Ryder Cup and represent the States in the Olympic Games?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, schedule is always a big part of your season. You sit down at the beginning of the year just to kind of schedule out to see, you know, what events fall where. You know, how you're playing.
But everybody is different on the amount of events they like to play in a row or how many weeks they want to have off, when they need time off.
But yeah, it's something that you constantly battle every year, making a good schedule that fits you. Yeah, obviously Olympic year is more difficult just because, you know, the way the schedule falls, and obviously it's an extra tournament that's in the season, so they moved some things around.
But yeah, obviously representing the United States in the Olympics is something that, you know, definitely be proud to do. But is it going to fit in the schedule properly? I'm not really sure about that, because there's so many events that are right there and leading up to it. So you know, I'm still working with my team to figure out what's the best thing for me to do.
TOM BENBOW: Thanks very much for joining us, Dustin. Best of luck this week.
TOM BENBOW: We welcome back our defending champion, Dustin Johnson to the Saudi International. The current world No. 5 was victorious last year with a total score of 19-under par.
