  Q. What's the challenged of a jumbled and uncertain schedule, even though it happens often during the course of a year?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know. You kind of get an idea of what time we're going to go, but you still don't know and you kind of just got to guess. But we're going to tee off late tomorrow and so actually just got to kind of find something to do.  
  
  Q. What was your day like yesterday? Take us through the last 36 hours. You've been waking up early, sitting around here. Etcetera.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: When I got up yesterday morning I got up pretty early, went and had breakfast and I heard about the fog delay and that we were going to be pretty late teeing off, so I went to the gym. Came out here around 12:30 and had some lunch, hung out for a little bit and then went and warmed up.  
  
  Q. What's the relative advantage of turning around that quickly when you're playing well?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well it definitely helps to get both rounds in. Even though we didn't quite get finished last night we only had a couple holes to play today and then getting out there today and getting the whole round in is definitely an advantage.  
  
  Q. You almost beheaded Chad Campbell behind the 6th green there, I think they were expecting the ball to end up on the left where everyone else was driving it. And you hit it over their head. You must have hit that thing 360 to the green?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think it was like 315 hole, but, yeah, I didn't expect it to go that far, kind of it went a little too far. But it worked out okay.   
  
  Q. On 8, you flew that with an 8-iron? On the par-3.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean the wind's kicking pretty good, it's kind of tough to judge how far the ball is going to go, especially downwind. And yeah, 200 hole and I hit an 8-iron and flew about 220, so yeah, I wasn't looking for that, but I hit a good pitch and hit a good putt but made an unfortunate bogey there.  
  
  Q. How often does your length surprise you?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean it still does sometimes. But it's straight downwind. It's tough to judge. But it's just really hard for me to be back at 200 yards and say it's a 9-iron. I just can't do it.   
  
  Q. Your caddie said this as well, I know you've been asked but after the U.S. Open he said pretty much has there been any back and forth sense of it? Are you still affected by it?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's already past. You can't really -- dwelling on it can't help anything. So, no, I got this tournament to look at and I always try to focus on what I'm doing at the time and not what I did in the past.   
  
  Q. How did you put a moment like that behind you so easily and so casually?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: That's just my personality, I guess.   
 I don't know. I just always look forward.   
  
  Q. Tell us a little bit about Pete Dye and what knowing coming to one of the Pete Dye courses, especially in a major championship, does to a player's psyche.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, this course is very, it's really visually intimidating, which a lot of his stuff is kind of visually intimidating. And the greens are tough. Which he's known for having tough greens and you really got to hit the ball in the right part of the green to have a good putt.
