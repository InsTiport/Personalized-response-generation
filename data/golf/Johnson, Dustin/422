 Q.   Dustin, you climbed all the way back in there until 17; what happened there?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I was playing really well.   Really confident, swinging the driver really good.   So you know, it's a driver hole for me, and I just blocked it a little bit, made a poor swing.  
   
 Q.   How disappointed are you right now?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Not too happy, but I felt really good with my golf game.   I'm looking forward to the next several weeks.   I like both the golf courses.   Other than the one drive I hit today on 17, I'm actually driving it really well.   That is one thing I have been struggling with is the driver.   But this new Taylor Made SLDR driver I've been hitting has been working really well for me.   I'm really confident with it.   You know, just happened to make a poor swing with a bad wind, and kind of just amplified it.  
   
 Q.   Were you trying to shape your shot in there?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I was trying to draw it back into the wind and I just blocked it.  
   
 Q.   Is this something thatyou can ‑‑  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I'm done.   It's nothing, nothing to worry about.   I'll go get them next weekend.
