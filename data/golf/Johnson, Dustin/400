  DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I love this golf course.   I think it's a great golf course.   It's fantastic, and it's in great shape right now, too.   Obviously the weather couldn't be any better.  
   
 Q.   How much has the confidence carried over?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I've been playing pretty good all year, so the game's right where I want it to be.   You know, coming off a good week last week, I'm definitely feeling good coming in this week and then obviously getting off to a great start today.   Any score under par out here is a pretty solid round.   It's a tough course, but it's right in front of you, so it's just a golf course that I really like.   
   
 Q.   This course is notorious for getting rain and now we are in a drought; how does it change how the course sets up?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   We play it, seems like every other year, we play it where it's kind of firm.   Next year it will probably be soft.   Right now it's in perfect condition and have zero complaints about the course.   
Generally I haven't played well coming off a long break but this time I kind of stayed with it and practiced and never took too much time off.   A little rusty, just a little rusty maybe mentally more than anything.   Plus the weather was so bad last week that it was tough to stay focused the whole time.   And playing sixâ€‘hour rounds in the cold, wet weather, sometimes you lose concentration a little bit.
