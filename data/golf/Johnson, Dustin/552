 Q. A couple comments on this week. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You've got to play four rounds. I struggled a little bit with the putter, didn't hit it as well as I have been. You can't really do anything about it. Strick played very well all week, and he's still playing well.

 Q. For you what do you take out of the fact that you bounced back with a great score today?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, I played well all week, just struggled a little bit yesterday. I knew I was going to come out and play well today, and I did. Unfortunately I couldn't -- I didn't hit it very well on the back nine, but I still hung in there. I had a three-putt which hurt pretty bad. But overall played very solid today.

 Q. You've won, you're going to go back and defend here. What do you get out of this experience playing with a guy like Stricker and being in contention again?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: You know, it's always good to get in contention and get those juices flowing. Playing with Strick, what a great guy, and also an unbelievable player. 

 Q. Long week obviously battling all the elements, which really adds to it. How much did that take out of you and how proud are you that you hung in there and finished as solid as you did? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was a pretty special week. You know, it was early mornings, but I managed my time pretty well, went to bed and got some sleep, so it didn't bother me too much.
