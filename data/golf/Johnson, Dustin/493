 Q. What would you have thought coming to the 14th tee, that you would finish where you did?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Obviously we wanted to -- talking about we needed to just get looks on the rest of the holes just so we could have a chance. We needed to make a few birdies at least. Standing on 14 I wanted to make a few birdies and give myself a chance to get back in this thing, and I was fortunate enough to birdie 14, 15 and eagle 16 and birdie 17. If you would have bet me money that I would be 1-under par standing on the 18th tee, I would have taken it.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: That's some really good golfing. He played early. The wind started to die down a little bit here on our last few holes. He played in a pretty strong wind all day. Obviously his putter is working really well. But he's hitting some quality golf shots, too. Yeah, I thought it was a great round. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm not very excited at all. I'm going to go home and sleep. I'm not feeling all that well, so a little bit under the weather. My glands are all swollen.

 Q. What happened?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know, I've got some kind of infection. I'm on some antibiotics, so hopefully it'll go away.

 Q. Throat infection?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Sore throat, I don't know, something.

 Q. When did you start on the antibiotics?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yesterday. I'm going to go home and rest.
