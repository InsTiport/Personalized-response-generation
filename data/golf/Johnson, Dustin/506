  Q. Just a quick assessment of your day.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I got off to a pretty good start. Played solid on the front and missed two short birdie putts but other than that, I played pretty solid.   
 And you know, the wind picked up on the back nine, so it made it really tough to get it close to the hole. And you know, just played so-so on the back.   
 Hit some good shots. Just didn't really make anything and 3-putted 18 which didn't help.   
  
  Q. That sum up the day in a way?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was -- overall, I'm happy with the day. I shot 2-under so it's not that bad. It played pretty tough.   
 Maybe come out in the morning with an early tee time, hopefully no wind is blowing and make a run.  
  
  Q. What's up with the shoulder?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: My neck. I think I slept on it wrong, so it's tight. It didn't bother me until I was on the range and hit a couple of balls and felt something and it just tightened up really bad. It all right, though.
