DUSTIN JOHNSON: I missed three or four short ones.
Q. Jordan said it wasn't the speed of the winds as much as just the unpredictability of them.  Can you elaborate?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: The winds were kind of gusty.  I felt like it was kind of no directions little bit.  So it made it difficult to judge.
Q. Overall how would you sum up your success on this course?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't understand why I haven't had more success here because I like the golf course.  I feel like it sets up well for me.  And I'm going to have success this year.  That's the plan.
Q. (No microphone.)
DUSTIN JOHNSON: If I want to compete and I want to be at the top of the leaderboard come Sunday I need to drive it well.
Q. What motivates you this time of the year, is it any different --
DUSTIN JOHNSON: The FedExCup and all the cash that's available to win.  That's plenty of motivation for me.
Q. You've got this great ability to just move forward so well.  Anything in life that makes you look back at any one of them?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, because I had no control over it, so it wasn't like -- yeah, I could have played better, but I didn't, so it was -- it was actually kind of fun being in the situation and watching.  And then watching the playoff, I mean I've played with Rory and Chappell, but I was pulling pretty hard for Chappell.  I had a lot of reasons.
Q. Two years later as you're walking down a sidewalk and you see Chappy, do you say, hey, there's Chappy or --
DUSTIN JOHNSON: He owes me three dollars.
Q. Is your motivation really cash?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, the FedExCup, I want to win the FedExCup.
