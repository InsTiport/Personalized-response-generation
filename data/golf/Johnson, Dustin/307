Q. How were the conditions there coming down the stretch with the wind?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, it was really tough.  I mean, it was blowing really hard.  It's cold and it's blowing -- the last four, five holes are straight in and off the left.  It played difficult.  Just played tough.  I mean I had -- missed a short birdie putt there on 18 in the dark, but, you know, the conditions all day were tough.
Q. How do you feel about your position through 36 heading into the weekend?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm happy with where I'm at.  Obviously today I didn't play quite as well as I would like to.  It was a tough day, and I didn't really have my best stuff and I still managed to get a round under par, so is a pretty decent score today.  I'm happy with that.  I'm very happy with my position going into the weekend.
Q. Did your approach have to change at all given the conditions and wind?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  I mean, yeah, the wind is blowing in different directions than yesterday.  You're hitting a lot of things, but as far as I didn't change the game plan at all.
