  Q. We just talked a couple of minutes ago about your stated goals of coming here and winning a FedExCup.  You've done so many things in this sport.  What does it mean to you to be a FedExCup champion?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, it means a lot.  Obviously it's a very tough trophy to win.  I've been close several times.  This time I did control my own destiny, which I knew what I had to do.  I had the lead to start, but I still had to go out and play well today.
 I had a lot of great players right behind me and they played some good golf today.  It got pretty close there at the end, which is what I thought it would be.  I knew I was going to have to come down the stretch and hit some golf shots.
 But I'm very proud of winning the FedExCup Trophy.
 Q. This is a year-long journey to win the FedExCup, and it's so difficult to win, as you said.  Jay was just saying, the commissioner, about your three victories and how well you played in these FedExCup Playoffs, first, second in a playoff, and then first here at the TOUR Championship.  How would you compare the way you're playing right now versus any other time in your illustrious career?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I'm definitely playing probably the best I've ever played.  I really feel like everything is dialed in pretty well.
 Obviously here you play this golf course, you think you're driving it bad but you're really not just because the fairways are so narrow.  Yeah, I've just got a lot of confidence in every part of my game right now, so obviously I'm looking forward to -- obviously we've got a couple days off, but then our new season starts back Thursday, I guess.
 I'm not playing this week, but U.S. Open, you've only got a few days and then got to get ready for the U.S. Open.
 But yeah, hopefully get to celebrate this win a little bit with the family.  Paulina came up today so I'm really excited about that, and then I'll get home and see the kids tomorrow morning.
