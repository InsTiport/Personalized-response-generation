Q. Probably a slower start than you wanted to, and you guys were playing from behind most of the way.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, we gave them the first hole.  But, you know, other than that, you know, we played pretty solid, had a lot of good looks, had a lot of putts that didn't go in, quite a few lip-outs.  But and they made some long ones and they played pretty steady.  But we didn't really give them any holes other than the first.  But then we -- Rickie made a nice birdie on 2 to tie it right back up.  Just from there, you know, we had a lot of opportunities, but they never gave us anything.  They made a lot of nice putts, so they played very well.
Q. As daunting as it seems rights now, only 12 out of 28 matches have been played, 16 still to go, so there's still time, right?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Absolutely.  We need to go out and have a good session this afternoon, though.  Absolutely.
Q. And do you -- how are you and Brooks going to pair and are you guys the ones to lead it off?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yes, we're going to go out and lead us off and get us that first point.
