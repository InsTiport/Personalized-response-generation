 Q.  Looked like a pretty solid round of golf out there.  How did it feel?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was good.  I hit it well.  Hit a lot of really good shots, had a lot of good looks at birdies, and made a lot of good putts that didn't go in, too.  But it was really solid.  I felt like I played solid all day.  I was in control of the golf ball and gave myself a lot of opportunities.   
 Q.  Did you feel like you left some out there though?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, there were quite a few that I did, but that's golf.  But I still felt like I put together a really solid round.  But, you know, you can always make a few more putts.   
 Q.  Make eagle on 2, that sort of jump start your day?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's always -- I hit two good shots into 2 and a nice putt.  Anytime you make an eagle, it helps the round out, for sure.   
 Q.  What is the plan for the weekend?  More eagles?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'll take as many as I can get for the next two days.   
 Q.  There are a lot out there.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, you drive it on the fairway, I could reach all the par-5s with irons, but I've got to be in the fairway.   
 Q.  Is it going to be a birdie fest?  You're going to have to go low, you think?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, the greens -- the golf course is in too good a shape not to have to go low.  Today was fairly windy, but with the greens being receptive and then the greens are perfect, yeah, you're going to have to attack the golf course and you're going to have to shoot low.
