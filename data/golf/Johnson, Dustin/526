   DUSTIN JOHNSON: Any time you can play this golf course with no bogeys you're doing pretty good.

 Q. Do you think you can win?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Depends on what the leaders get to. But I definitely put myself into the hunt for going into tomorrow.

 Q. What's too far away at the end of the day, do you think, how many shots?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, I guess you never know out here. But if I can play like I did today, there's not too much out of reach. 

 Q. How did you play 5 today?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I made par. I hit it -- I hit driver. I was trying to cut a driver, hit it a little too good. Hit it long, left over the green. Not a good spot. But I hit a good pitch, and then back onto the green and then just barely missed about a 20-footer.

 Q. What happened on 13, 13 got an eagle?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: 13, I hit -- finally hit the fairway on that hole. And got it down there. Got 280 hole and hit 3-wood, hit a great 3-wood to the left of the flag to about 15, 20 feet.

 Q. What did you think of the fans applause coming out of the woods on 17?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, it's nice, but it's good to have a lot of people out there following me. It was a fun day. 
 And you know to have a good crowd out there, too, it makes it that much better.

 Q. How hard was it to put the events of what's happened, the big event in your life this year, put it behind you and move forward?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Not hard at all. I mean, because there's nothing really to put behind me. I mean, I played good golf. Unfortunate situation. It's not very hard to let go, though.

 Q. Did you need sunshine to get to 13 and 2? Could you have done it on Wednesday?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, no way. Yeah, I definitely needed sunshine. 

 Q. Has there been a par 5 at any tournament you've played that you couldn't get to in two?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm pretty sure. It always depends on the conditions, but there's not too many. 

 Q. Is the course firming up?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: A little bit. I mean, I thought it was, and then I got to 18 and I had a mud ball. So it was the only one I had all day. So the course is definitely firming up. The greens are firming up. 
 The fairways are a little bit. 

 Q. That was your only mud ball on 18?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: 18 was. It made it turn a little more.
