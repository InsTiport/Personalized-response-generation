 Q.   Dustin, first of all, thoughts on the golf course here.   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's a good golf course.   I like it.   It's the first time I've seen it, today.   You know, it'll probably be a good course, sets up well for me.   Drawing off a lot of the tees off here, so I like that.   
You definitely gotta drive it straight in the fairways.   They're fairly narrow.   It's the first time I've seen it.   But I like it.   I was on one of the par 3s on the back, 14, maybe, long downhill, could be a little ‑‑  
   
 Q.   Thoughts after playing so well last week and having all that time off, getting back better?   How do you feel today as opposed to a week ago?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm feeling good.   I just gotta keep getting tougher.   Last week I competed.   I was kind of right in there within a few holes until Saturday and then a few bogeys.   And I bogeyed the last two holes.   And same thing on Sunday.   My last three holes, so that hurt a little bit.   But overall I'm very happy with my week.   I did fairly well.  
   
 Q.   Some people may not play this week, just head out to San Francisco early, take a look at it.   Is it about the competition here this week and just kind of going through all that?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah.   I've had so much time off I need to play.   So that's one reason why I'm here.   They put on a great event here, and I'm happy to be here, but probably, you know, in a normal year I probably would be headed out to Olympic a little bit early to practice.   I need a good rest in, and need some competition.   So I'm glad to be here.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you're close, you're there; you can be a winner again soon?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah.   I'm getting there, getting close.  
   
 Q.   Thanks a lot.
