 Q.  You played two days here.  You've got two wins, two important wins?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, all the matches here are important.  So to get two victories, I'm very happy with that.   
 Q.  How tough was the golf course today?  Yesterday you said you hit a lot of drivers.  Was it the same with the high winds today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, the wind was blowing the same direction.  So the golf course played a lot more difficult today with the high winds.  But still kind of the same clubs off the tee.   
 Q.  You are playing Zach Johnson tomorrow.  He needs to beat you to get to two points.  Martin Kaymer if we wins his match against Webb Simpson gets to two points.  A lot can still happen, even though you're in a great position.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I kind of control my own destiny.  If I win my match tomorrow, then I might be through.  That's the plan, just go out and play some really solid golf.   
 Q.  Pretty windy, are you going to practice?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it's way too windy to go out and practice.   
 Q.  How long do you think you've been on a roll?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know.  I feel like I've been playing pretty well since the beginning of last year.  I feel like it's just been really solid, nothing has really changed.  I didn't have to change anything, keep working on the same things.   
 Q.  Is this the best you've played recently?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I feel like I'm playing pretty well.   
 Q.  What suits your game better, stroke play or match play?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't mind it.  We don't play match play very much, but I like it.  You hit a bad shot, you just go to the next hole, so it's not too bad.  But we play stroke play all the time, so I like stroke play.   
 Q.  Do you think a guy can be intimidating in match play?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I guess.   
 Q.  Are you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Am I intimidating?   
 Q.  I'm not saying are you intimidated, I'm saying are you intimidating to your opponent?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know.  You have to ask them.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on the course?  Do you like this golf course?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I think the golf course is good.  I like it.  You've got to drive it straight and hit good shots.  The greens are undulating, so you have to control your golfball getting to the greens.  But today was just really windy so it played difficult.
