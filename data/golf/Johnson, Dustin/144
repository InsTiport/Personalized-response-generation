Q. How would you assess the day today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was okay.  Definitely a lot of good things, but I've got a few things that I can definitely work on.  It was fairly solid week.  Could have been a lot better.  Played the par-5s terrible this week.  Other than that, it was pretty solid week though.  I felt like I had some moments where I was very good.  But I feel like the game's in good form leading into, I'm going to play Memphis next week, and then obviously the U.S. Open.  But I feel like things are starting to come together right at the right time.
Q. What would you say is the biggest thing you need to work on while you're playing Memphis to get ready for the U.S. Open?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel like the irons are really good.  Need to maybe work on the driving a little bit.  It's not quite as good as I would like to have it right now.  The irons and wedges, I feel like I've got those dialed in pretty good and the putter's rolling nicely.
Q. Did you take a trip to Shinnecock?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I have not yet.
Q. Will you?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know.  I'm debating.  I might go Tuesday and play, before Memphis.
Q. I looked at the schedule.  Last year you didn't play Memphis.  You did not last year.  The year before you did.  You historically played it.  Bringing it back in your schedule, is it just a matter of it fitting better in your schedule or is that what you want to do before the U.S. Open?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I just felt like -- well, Masters I had, after Hilton Head I had three weeks off.  I played THE PLAYERS, which was okay, I was a little rusty.  And then couple weeks off and played here.  And I just felt like I needed to get a couple more reps in before the U.S. Open, just to go in there pretty -- I would rather go in there sharper than go up there and get more practice rounds in.
