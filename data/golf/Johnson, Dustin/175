Q. Solid day, only the lone bogey on the card and a good way to open up 2018.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it was a really solid round, I thought I played really well.  Definitely missed some putts, but I felt like I hit good putts, just didn't have quite enough speed and lipped out a few on the low side.  But other than that, yeah, it was really solid.  Had a lot of good looks at birdies and only the one bogey, which I shouldn't have made.  But other than that it was a pretty good day.
Q. Even coming home on 17 and 18, those were putts that I thought you had both of them, I thought you thought you had them as well.  When you're hitting good putts like that, and playing on greens that are this difficult, I guess you can't avoid it, just keep hitting good putts, eventually they will go in?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, just got to trust your lines, hit them and I feel like I'm rolling it good, so I'm going to make some putts, but the greens are, they're difficult, they're a lot of slope, a lot of grain, so it makes it tough to make putts, but I feel like I'm rolling it pretty well, but just got to keep giving myself some chances.
