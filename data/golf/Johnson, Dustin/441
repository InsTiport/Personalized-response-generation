Q.   Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar, talk about the roar at the 17th when you holed that crucial birdie putt to go 1â€‘up to the 18th. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   You know, it was probably the loudest roar I've ever heard, especially in this situation.   We were all square, and my partner, Matt, he had been carrying me all day pretty much.   I made a couple good shots on the back nine, but that was definitely in that situation probably one of the best putts I've ever made. 

Q.   Matt, talk about not having control of the match at 18 and having to watch Nicolas Colsaerts hit a putt that was worth half a point. 
MATT KUCHAR:   That's not a nice feeling to be in.   You want to have control.   You want to be that last guy putting.   But so proud of this guy.   He struggled today and I kept telling him I've got faith in you, I know it's going to turn around.   This guy came through so big.   That putt on 17 and then being there on 18, that's just awesome.
