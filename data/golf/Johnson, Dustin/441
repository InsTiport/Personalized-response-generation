 Q.   How enjoyable is playing this links course?   Can't get much better than this, can it?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's a lot of fun.   I really enjoy coming over here and get to go play with my brother and some of the other pros and celebrities.   It's a lot of fun and St. Andrews is a great place to be.  
   
 Q.   What is the plan for tomorrow, to shoot as low as possible?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I need to go out and shoot a good score.   And then obviously the better I play, the better the team is going to do, and then if he plays like he did today, we'll be just fine.   
   
 Q.   How are your energy levels after last week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I'm doing fine.   Obviously a little disappointed in my first two rounds, but played better today other than I made double on 12, which kind of sucked.   But other than that, I played really good.  
I really didn't hit that poor of a tee shot.   I just pushed it a little bit right in the gorse.   But other than that, I played really well all day.   I probably had six putts that should have gone in the hole that didn't.   Today was a good day.   
   
 Q.   Are you over The Ryder Cup?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, yeah.   It's fine.   
   
 Q.   Has this been a good kind of release, miles away?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's all right.   You know, I played well in The Ryder Cup.   The team played really well.   We just got outâ€‘played on Sunday.   
   
 Q.   Have you any thoughts, just talk about Paul Azinger maybe captaincy or the next; any thoughts on who would be a good captain?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I thought Davis did a great job captaining.   I don't know who is going to be next.   I don't know who is next on the list but whoever they pick is going to be a good one.  
   
 Q.   Much golf left this year?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, just a couple tournaments.   Play HSBC and Tiger's event.   So that's about it.   
   
 Q.   I've seen you a few times over here in Europe, any thoughts of playing more of a schedule over here?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No.   
   
 Q.   This one again?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I like this event, so I'll be back here.   We have good fun.
