   MARK WILLIAMS: I'd like to welcome Dustin Johnson to the interview room. Justin shot a 67 today on Poppy Hills and has a five-stroke lead currently at the AT&T Pebble Beach. If you'd kind of go into your round today and kind of your thoughts going into tomorrow.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: What do you want to know about, just how I played today?   
  
  Q. Yeah, just overall thoughts on your round.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I got off to kind of a little bit of a rough start. I hit a few bad shots, but my short game was very good, so I chipped it close and made the putts. So that kept me going a little bit.  
 I made a good putt on No. 7, which is a par-5 on the front nine for birdie.   
 I hit it close on 8 and three-putted.   
 Then I went to 9, hit it real close for eagle and missed it.   
  
  Q. How close was it?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: 10 feet. I just got a little excited. It was the first time I had a good look at eagle all day. I hit it hard.   
 Then hit it 12 feet on 9 for eagle, two-putted. Had a pretty good little stretch.   
 10 was a par-5, hit a really good drive down there and I hit it about 20 feet for eagle on 10.  
 Then I chipped in on 11 for birdie. So my round got going pretty well.   
 Then on 12, another par-5, I hit a pretty good tee shot just through the fairway and then hit a really good second shot to about 12 feet for eagle, again, and two-putted for birdie. That kind of got me going pretty good.   
 I hit some good shots coming in, just couldn't make any putts. Then I made a good putt on the last for birdie.   
  
  Q. Talk about 7; why did you say that was a good putt?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: That was about 30 feet. 7 is a pretty difficult par-5. It's playing like 600 yards into the wind uphill.  
  
  Q. What did you do on 18 that you were so pleased with?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I hit a terrible tee shot right and then laid it up in the first cut, and I had like 72 yards and hit it about probably seven feet right behind the hole. It was a very fast putt with about a foot and a half of break, so made a really good putt there.  
  
  Q. You birdied all the par-5s today?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I birdied all the par-5s. Out there you've just going to take advantage of the par-5s and usually you're going to play pretty well.  
  
  Q. You've got a five-shot lead, I think?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  
  
  Q. When was the last time you played with a lead that big?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Probably in college. I don't really know. Maybe a couple amateur tournaments. But it's probably been in college since the last time I had a pretty big lead.  
  
  Q. Are you comfortable with that?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  
  
  Q. It's better than the opposite.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'd rather be in the lead than not.  
  
  Q. Pebble in bad weather can be the worst of the three courses, and they're talking that it might be very severe tomorrow. Do you just go out and play the same game or try to alter it because of the weather?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I'm not going to change my game plan at all. Obviously everyone is going to be playing in the same weather, so if it's difficult for me, it's difficult for everyone.   
  
  Q. How many people were out there following you at Poppy today?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know, maybe 20 or 30. It wasn't a bunch of people. Poppy is not very fun to walk for spectators.   
  
  Q. You possibly answered this a second ago when I talked about the lead, but do you change anything as opposed to how things go in a tournament on the last day? You've got some room to --  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, you don't really go away from your game plan at all. I played well here the first day and looking forward to tomorrow and not going to change the game plan at all.   
  
  Q. Dare I ask what the game plan is?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know, it's hole by hole. That would take a while to go through.   
  
  Q. This is obviously a different tournament because of the celebs and the three courses. The celebs are here today and you're out there leading the tournament. Does that bother you at all that nobody is paying attention to the real tournament leader and they're worried about Bill Murray?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, not really. It is a little bit different because you're spread out on three courses, but I've still got to play golf. I don't care if there's 100,000 people or 10 people; it doesn't matter.   
  
  Q. You do have a pretty comfortable lead. You said you're comfortable going in, but are you a little bit nervous? This is the AT&T, it's a pretty big tournament. It would be a huge win for you. Are you going to sleep well tonight?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I can sleep always. I'll get some sleep. Yeah, any time you're in the lead or right around the lead, you're going to be nervous, but it's a good nervous. You like the feeling you get inside when you've got the lead.   
 MARK STEVENS: Thanks, Dustin.
