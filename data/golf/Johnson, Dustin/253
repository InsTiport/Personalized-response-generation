 Q.  Towards the end you knew that the Cup was clinched for the United States team, what was it like out there for you to finish it off?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Really just coming up the last hole, so it was -- I mean, it was great.  Obviously it takes a lot of the pressure off of you, too.  I knew my match was going to be important today.  So I felt like we both had a great match, and then obviously coming up the last hole and we know we've already got it done was definitely a relief.   
 Q.  This was your third Ryder Cup.  What was the difference this time, you think, for the United States team?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just our team.  I think our team chemistry was so good.  We all got a lot of trust in each other.  I feel like we all get along so well.  We came out here and we played for each other, we played for our country and we played for all these fans.   
 Q.  How would you summarize 2016 for you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's been a good year.  It's been a good year.
