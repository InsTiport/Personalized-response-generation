 Q.  How would you assess today's play?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I played really good again today.  I played really solid.  I felt like the golf game I was in control all day.  There were a couple bad tee shots around 4 and 5 but other than that I felt like I drove it pretty well and hit a lot of great iron shots.  Rolled the putter good.  Didn't make my putts but rolled it good.  Burned the edge a few times.  But all in all it was a pretty solid day.   
 Q.  What do you think the weekend has in score?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I just need to keep striking it like I am, I'm going to be right there come Sunday for sure.   
 Q.  On 18, can you talk about what you saw, just as far as trying to make that and how you read it?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I just pushed it.  Just pushed my putt.  It was an inside right putt and started it outside the hole.   
 Q.  What did you do on 4?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I just sliced it (laughter).   
 Q.  Was it an over-correct on the next one do you think?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was above.  I just hung back a little bit on both those drives.  One I held on to and it sliced, and the other one I released and it just went just straight down the left side.   
But you know, hit good drives on and 8 9.  I mean, it was fine.  Just a little bit of a hiccup.   
 Q.  How would you categorize your year so far?  Didn't win a major but obviously won a handful of times earlier in the year and playing well now.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's been pretty solid.  I feel like it's been a good year.  Obviously I'd have liked to play better in the majors.  Getting hurt before Augusta, which is going right into the major season, didn't really help, especially for the momentum and how good I felt like I was swinging, and everything was going in a really good direction.   
But I feel like I've got it back on the right track.  I feel like I'm swinging well again.  I'm rolling the putter good, driving it well.  I mean, I'm looking forward to the rest of the Playoffs.   
 Q.  I know it's been a long time since that injury at Augusta, but has there been any point over the last few weeks where you felt either pain or discomfort on or off the golf course?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, no, I've been fine.  Last month or so I've been good.   
 Q.  What do you think about the New York crowd so far?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: They have been good.  I have a lot of fans up here.  I'm glad they like me, that's for sure.
