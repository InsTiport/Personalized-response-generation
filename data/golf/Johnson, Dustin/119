 Q.  Kind of a heavyweight battle out there this afternoon.  Came out on the short end.  Seemed like they may have made an extra putt or two along the way.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, Stenson made some really nice par putts for them, especially there on 16 and 17, some big par putts.  And we really didn't roll in anything.  I think we both -- both teams played fairly well, it was definitely a close, tight match.  We just couldn't get anything to roll in the hole.  They were rolling around the hole, they just weren't going in.   
 Q.  This isn't over, though, going into tomorrow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, absolutely not.  As I recall, at Medinah, pretty sure we were down 10-6 going into Sunday and ended up losing.  So I think it might be our turn to flip it around on them.
