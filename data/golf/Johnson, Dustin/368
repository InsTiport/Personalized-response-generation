Q.   A couple of comments about being back.   A significant tournament, gave you your first start on the PGA Tour back in '07 or '08?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I've played a couple of times at the old course it was at.   This is my first time seeing it today.   The golf course is great.   It's in really good shape.   I like the course, I think it's fairly tough.   And I think it will be a good week.

Q.   The greens right now, one of the guys called them magnificent?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, the greens, they're really good.   They roll nice.   I think they're fairly easy to read.   If you hit a good putt it goes in. 
The greens are tough, there's a lot of slopes in them, so it's going to be tough to get it close to the flag.   But they're putting very well.

Q.   You're keeping your streak alive.   You've got at least one win so far this year.   How are you feeling about your game coming in, how is your confidence level feeling?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's really good.   I feel like I'm playing really good right now.   Obviously last time I played I won at Doral.   But the game's in good shape.   I'm happy with my year so far.   And looking forward to the rest of the year. 

Q.   What did you learn from the layoff?   What did you learn about yourself?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I don't know, I learned a lot of stuff.   But it's been very good to get back.   And I'm in a really good place.   The golf game is good.   The family is good.   My son is good.   Everything is really good right now.
