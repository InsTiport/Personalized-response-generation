 Q.  Good fight.  How big is that birdie to finish to just make today feel better and head clear going into tomorrow?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, it was just -- I had a rough day on the greens.  It didn't feel like I was hitting bad putts.  I don't know, ball was not going in the hole.  Hit a lot of good shots out there that didn't end up very good.  I still feel like I'm playing well, driving it really well and that's the big key for me.   
You know, tomorrow, hopefully get some putts to roll in.   
 Q.  You leaned on the 3-iron a little today off the tee.  Hit some beautiful irons off the tee.  Was there more irons than yesterday's round, and if so, will you lean on the iron again tomorrow a little bit and start thinking maybe driver for par fives, etc.?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, it all depends on where the flags are.  I hit a 2-iron on 10 today just because I knew if I hit driver, I was going to get too close to the green.  I couldn't stop it because the pin was tucked over there over the bunker.  I ended up hitting a really good shot in there on 10.  Just didn't hit a good putt.  Kind of dove right across the hole.  I hit a lot of those putts today where it looked like they were going, and then right at the last second, they were dying or catching the lip and or just missed.   
Other than that, I felt like I played pretty solid today.  I felt like 71 was the absolute highest score I could have shot.   
 Q.  What were the course conditions like out there for you today?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: The conditions were pretty difficult.  It was windy.  I had a hard time adjusting to the greens.  I think they put a lot of water on them.  It seemed like some greens were really soft, some greens were hard.  I thought they were really inconsistent.  But they are still rolling beautiful, I just thought the firmness was a little inconsistent.   
 Q.  You mentioned you would make adjustments based on conditions.  What adjustments did you make?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I had a hard time adjusting today.  Yeah, I would either hit it too far or too short.  I feel like I'm hitting good shots.   
But today was all about, I just didn't make any putts.  Felt like I rolled it pretty well.  Just didn't make anything.   
 Q.  You dropped a couple shots at 14 and 15.  What's it mean to get one back at 18 there?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, it was nice to make a putt finally.  But still, I hit a poor chip and just fortunately I made a 10-footer.   
Yeah, I dropped two bad shots on 14 and 15.  And then 16, too, I 3-putted 16.   
71 is about the worst  --  that was about as high as I could shoot today.  I felt like I played pretty solid today.   
 Q.  71 for the second consecutive day, but not all 71s are created equal.  How did this one compare to yesterday?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: That wasn't very good.  I felt like I played a lot better than 71.  I really struggled.  I felt like I struggled on the greens.  Felt like I was hitting pretty good putts.  They just were not going in the hole.  My speed wasn't that great today either.  I made two 3-putts.  I missed a handful of short birdie putts.  It wasn't a great 71.   
 Q.  With all that, if that's your bad round, you're still just one shot back.  What is your outlook going forward and what will you make sure to put emphasis on in the final round?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I've got to get better lines, because I felt like I hit pretty good putts.  Just didn't read them that well today, which I usually feel like I read them really well and I've got a good feel.  Today was just a little bit off.   
Tomorrow, I feel like I'm playing pretty well, swinging the ball well.  Got a lot of confidence in my golf swing right now.  So just need to go out and make some birdies early and put some numbers on the board.   
 Q.  Is it a little bit different given that 11 players are within three shots?  It's not as if you're looking at one guy here.  It's going to be a wild day on the last day.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I need to go out and shoot a really good score tomorrow.
