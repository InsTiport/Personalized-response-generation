Q.   Nice to win that first match, especially with the new format.   Talk about closing it out on 17. 
    DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It was tough match.   I thought I played pretty solid, just didn't make a lot of birdies.   Made a couple on the back, got me a couple up.   It was nice finish.   Always good to win that first match.

Q.   What did you think of the course conditions?   First time you had a chance to play here in a while?
    DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I thought the course was great.   I think it's fantastic.   It's in great shape.   I thought they did a good job setting it up today.   I like it much better than the previous course.   For me it sets up a lot better.   It's a great golf course.   You've got to hit good shots.

Q.   The mindset, knowing that you still have two more matches to play.   Was it any less tense this opening day?
    DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No.   You still‑‑ only one guy comes out of the four‑man bracket.   It's really important to get that first one.
