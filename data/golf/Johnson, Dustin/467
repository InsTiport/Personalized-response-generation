 Q.   Obviously tough day out there, talk about the match.   Mark got up early?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I've been down with my allergies and sinuses all week.   I think it just caught up to me.   I didn't feel so good this morning when I got up.   I didn't feel good on the range.   You know, he played well, and I played awful.   So I hung in there.   Mark's a tough match.   I'm going to have to play good to beat him.   I played material.   I drove the ball bad, hit terrible iron shots.  
   
 Q.   Still your best performance here in the four days you've been here.   Do you still take some positives out of the week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Sure.   I kind of scraped around the first round and then I played well yesterday.   Yeah, I'm starting to figure out the golf course a little bit.  
Come back next year, I guess.   I don't know if it's going to be here next year, but if it is we'll come back next year and try to finish making it to Saturday.
