Q.   Dustin, just a couple quick ones, would you just comment on the day, 14 took the wind out of the sails there?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, my ball is a foot left coming out of the air.   It's a really good shot.   It just happened, it came up just a little bit short and it was about a foot too far right.   I know it's going to be tough. 
But I made a really good putt for 7.   I made a hell of an up‑and‑down for 7.   So I mean, I wasn't angry or anything.   I knew that that was kind of‑‑ I kind of needed to make something happen there.   But obviously Phil behind us was playing well.

Q.   Another good week for you at Pebble Beach, talk about this place and how special it is to you?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's always special.   It's a whole lot of fun to play here.   I really enjoy it.   I look forward to coming back every year, so I think it's a great format.   Wish we played a little bit quicker but other than that it's fantastic.   But if you're going to be stuck out on a golf course for six hours, this is a place that's not so bad.

Q.   Schedule going forward? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   L.A., Match Play, and then off, Doral. 

Q.   Talk about your putting? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It was better.   I rolled it better.   The first day I rolled it well.   But I putted better today.   I felt comfortable today with the putter, probably after maybe starting on the back side‑ish, I started rolling it better.   I just have to trust it, that's all it is.
