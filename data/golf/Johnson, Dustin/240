Q. A flawless scorecard today.  How did you put together a 66?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I played really well.  I feel like I've been playing pretty solid all three days and finally got a few putts to go in today.  But it's still, it's playing, it's not playing really easy, it's not easy to get the ball close to the holes and when you do it's hard to make putts.  But today I felt like I drove it really well and I hit a lot of nice solid iron shots.  So, it was just a pretty stress-free day.
Q. What exactly happened with that drop on 18?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, we were just trying to figure out where it went into the hazard.  So, it was definitely, it was hooking in, and so it was just trying to decide where it went, because they didn't have it on TV or anything.  So we just did a best guess between me and Jordan.  So, but, yeah, I ended up, didn't hit a great chip shot, but made a nice putt to save a good round.
Q. You're playing again with your fiance's father, Wayne Gretzky, what was his best shot of the day, in your opinion?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: He hit a lot of good ones today.  That one on 18 was nice.  He made a nice par for birdie there.  He got a stroke.  So, that helped us out.  But we played pretty well and made the cut again as a team, so we get to play tomorrow, so it will be a lot of fun.
