   THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Dustin Johnson back into the interview room. You were with us yesterday, we were talking about how much you like this golf course and how well you play here, and you had your 8th round in the 60s in your last nine attempts. Comment on today's round. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Got off to a rough start, hit two good shots on 10 and kinda missed it on the low side, then hooked it in the water on 11, then hit a good drive after that and pitched it over the green and got up and down for a double. 
 Came right back and birdied the next hole, hit it close on the next one and just played really well from there on out.
 THE MODERATOR: Good pairing, Sergio obviously played well, also. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, Sergio played well, too. It was a nice day. K.J. played well for the most part, missed a few putts, hit a lot of good ones, had a few come down the stretch and burn the edges and should have gone in, but overall it was a fun day. 

 Q. You're trying to do something early in the round and trying to go for the green. Talk about getting your mind-set back when something doesn't work. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, I usually always hit driver there so it's just the play that I like. I don't like hitin' -- even when you lay up there is a small fairway to hit it in, so I like hitin' driver and just hooked it. Hit a terrible drive, made a bad swing, hit a terrible drive. I didn't get too mad. 
 I was a little frustrated but came right back and made birdie on the next hole and hit a good shot on the next and just barely burned the edge, so I got right back in it. 

 Q. Do you think you guys were able to feed off each other? Sergio got off to a good start. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: He didn't hit a good tee shot -- well, he hit it pretty good. It leaked right on 10, over -- but he got lucky, got fortunate, and he had a shot at the flag from just left of the cart path and actually made it. So he got off to good start, K.J. went par birdie on 11, and I went par double so I wasn't feeling too good at that point but, you know, I made some putts today. 
 I rolled the putter well all day. I had a lot of putts that looked like they were going in that didn't so I was pleased with my round today. 

 Q. You said you rolled the putter good. How are the greens? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: The greens were great, so, you know, I got to give props to the grounds crew. They did a really good job of getting the greens ready, especially after that hail storm. That's -- definitely got to give them a hand. 

 Q. Dustin, how differently will the course play tomorrow when the south wind turns back around? 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, it seems like the wind blows different here every day you play it, so you just kinda -- today the wind was -- it wasn't blowing very hard but tomorrow it's supposed to blow and when the wind blows out here it plays really tough. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, sir. 
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Thank you.
