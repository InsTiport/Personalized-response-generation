 Q.  How hard was it today to just kind of gain traction and maintain it?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  I mean, my day is kind of summed up on the first hole when I one-hopped it into the flag and it came off the green and I made bogey.  You know, I hit two perfect shots and I make a 5 on No. 1, then hit two good shots on 2, horseshoed a four-footer.  That's just kind of how my day went.  I could never really get any momentum.  I hit some good shots, would lip out the putt.   
You know, but all in all, obviously finishing under par is a good finish.  I just kind of hung in there.  It definitely played tougher later in the day.  But feeling pretty -- I mean, I'm okay with the round.  Obviously it could have been really good today but ended up just being okay.   
 Q.  It's been a while since you've had a round like this --  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, last week the first couple days was a little frustrating.  I feel like the game is in really good shape.  I feel like I'm playing really well.  Today it wasn't easy.  This course isn't very easy.  A couple putts here, get a little momentum, and shoot 4- or 5-under.  But you know, still 1-under, and I'm right there.  Especially go out tomorrow morning, post a good score, and just put myself in position for this weekend.   
 Q.  You had another horseshoe somewhere, didn't you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: 12.  12 was a bad one, too.   
 Q.  Expecting bad things to happen when you do things like that?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Maybe on a day like today, I don't know.  It just seemed like nothing was going my way.  But you know, I still feel like the golf swing is in good shape.  You know, just made a poor bogey on 10 and 15, but other than that, you know, I felt like I played pretty well today.   
 Q.  Is it okay to have things not go your way and shoot 71 around here?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Absolutely.  It seems like everybody has one day around here where they struggle a little bit.  To get it in under par is very good.  You know, I'm pleased with it.  I just need to go out tomorrow morning obviously and post a good score.
