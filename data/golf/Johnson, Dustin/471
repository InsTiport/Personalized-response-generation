Q.   Well played out there especially after having to withdraw last week.   How did it go, and how did it feel? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Good.   Last week was the first time I walked in a few months, but the knee's good.   I feel great. 
Last week I just had a little bit of trouble because I favored my left side because I had surgery on my right knee.   So I struggled.   It wasn't the knee bothering me or anything, I just walked on the left basically and my back and stuff got a little tight. 
But I've been getting some treatment on it every day to make sure I don't get stiff again, but I feel great.   I felt good last week too.   It's just I stiffened up.

Q.   So what was going right for you out there today? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   You know, I hit the ball well.   Even though I missed a few fairways, but all the fairways I missed, it seemed like I was just a foot off.   These fairways out here on the North were really tight. 
But I drove the ball, hit my irons really good.   You know, I holed a couple putts.

Q.   As someone who hits the ball pretty long, you have to feel good about hitting the ball on this course, and going to the next course for the next three days.   What's out there. 
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I really like the South course.   I've been playing here for quite a few years now.   And I really enjoyed playing it.   It's a little bit tougher than the North.   I usually tend to play really well out there.
