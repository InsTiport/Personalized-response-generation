 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just not making enough putts.  It's definitely helped.  Because I'm a feel putter anyways and so the way you're doing it really is you're just feeling it, so it definitely, it works.   
 Q.  How long did it take you to pick it up, do you think?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Not very long.   
 Q.  A day or two?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, no, I was pretty good the first time I switched.  I had done it a little bit, like messing around with it.  (No microphone) I'm very pleased with the way I'm putting it today.   
 Q.  A lot of the pretournament chatter was about No. 1 and what this person has to do and what that person has to do.  Was this kind of your way of saying, hey, let's not forget about the guy who actually is No. 1?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, I don't care what people are talking about, it doesn't bother me.  I want to play good golf.   
 Q.  How much different when you play the course now as opposed to the first few times you were around here?  Is there any major differences?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't think so.  Just, I feel like I got a good game plan around here, I played -- I feel like I played it the same way most of the times I played it, other than I fade the ball instead of draw it -- but it still requires you to hit the same kind of shots off the tees.  But I don't know, today I drove it well and hit some nice shots and rolled in a few putts, it adds up to a good score.   
 Q.  What did you, what was the reason for switching putters?  What do you like about this putter?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well it's just kind of, it's almost in between.  I always liked putting with a blade, I putted with one forever, and then, but I've been using the Spider for the last year or so and this was kind of in between.
