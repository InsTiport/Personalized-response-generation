Just overall good to be back?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was good.  A little rusty.  I played okay today, I made three bogeys with wedges from the middle of the fairway.Q. I was going to ask you one, I know 5 I saw that one there, but the one at 6.  What happened?DUSTIN JOHNSON: Who knows?  I chunked it.  That's what happened.  Even I was surprised at that one.  Sometimes I'm not surprised with golf shots, I was surprised on that one.  That kind of throws it off a little bit the less of the way, too.Q. It actually looked like you laid it up perfectly to a great yardage.DUSTIN JOHNSON: I did.  I had 90 yards hole, it was perfect.  A little 60.  I was trying to hit it high.  I just hung back on it.Q. You eagle 4.  135?DUSTIN JOHNSON: What?  How far did I have in?  No, 159.  I hit a perfect, obviously, shot.Q. What did you hit in?DUSTIN JOHNSON: 8-iron.Q. What did you, going into today, what did you want to see out of your game or what did you see?DUSTIN JOHNSON: I just wanted to have just a solid round.  Whether it was -- I wanted it to be fairly easy.  I didn't make it too easy on myself. But I still played all right.  Even though I'm 2-over, I missed a handful of short putts, I missed two putts this far (Indicating), so. But overall it wasn't bad.  My chipping was pretty good.  I hit some good bunker shots.Q. You come out and start with a par-5.DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bad.  I hit a couple of bad chips and a couple bad wedges, other than that, I thought I played pretty well. I hit a few drives off line, but overall I drove it pretty well, I thought.  I hit a lot of fairways.  Just a few drives I missed were out to the right.
