Q. (Inaudible)? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought it was pretty good. I hit some really nice shots, had some good looks. I mean, I'm pretty pleased how it went for the first nine holes so far.

Q. Course kind of play the way you thought it would? It's softer? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON: There was so much rain this morning. We were watching on TV, you could tell the course looked really soft. You kind of need to come out and take advantage of the conditions right now because there wasn't really a whole lot of wind and really soft conditions, you can fire it at the flag. 

Q. Some long days coming up here. Is there any mentality you need to take to keep yourself loose and rested and everything? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think, for the guys that teed off in the afternoon, obviously, we played nine holes. Tomorrow we're good to come out. If you can get it going, obviously, you've got 27 holes potentially to play. Yeah, hopefully, come out tomorrow and get off to another good start and keep it rolling. 

Q. On this golf course, how important is a good start at Augusta? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, at any golf tournament, but especially Majors, especially at Augusta, but any golf tournament, it's always good to get off to a good start or just even a solid start, which I felt like I did. I got off to just a nice solid start. Hitting it good, leaving myself with nice putts, and hopefully rolling a few more tomorrow. 

Q. (Inaudible)? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, it's golf. We've still got to play. Coming out tomorrow, we know it's going to be a long day. So tonight, just go home and try to get as much rest as we can and be ready and be prepared for tomorrow.

Q. Was it interesting playing without the patrons? 
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's definitely strange playing Augusta without patrons. Even the practice rounds, there's so many people out here during Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. It's been strange all week, but it's still the Masters. They're still going to put a green jacket on somebody at the end of the week.
