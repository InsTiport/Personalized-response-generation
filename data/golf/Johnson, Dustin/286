DUSTIN JOHNSON: I felt like I had an opportunities and hit a lot of great putts that didn't go in the hole, a lot of lip-outs.  But these greens are really tough to putt.  I feel like I'm seeing the breaks really well and I'm hitting my putts solid and on my lines.  So it was a good, solid round.  This is a tough golf course.
Q. You've had a couple of near-misses in these big tournaments.  What do you take from those near-misses into the fourth round this week to try and win this golf tournament?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm going to have to go out and play a good round of golf.  I've got a lot of confidence in my game right now.  I feel like I'm swinging really well.  Just got to go out and play a good, solid round of golf and see what happens.
Q. Got a late tee time this afternoon.  What are you going to do to pass it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I have no idea.
Q. Good luck this afternoon, man.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Thanks.
Q. Couple pars to finish off today.  Take us through the round.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought it was a good, solid round.  This morning, came out and played 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.  So I had five holes to finish, played them 1 under, which is solid.  I had some good looks there.  Like I was saying, I've got a lot of confidence in my game right now.
I know I'm four back, but with this golf course, that can change in a hurry.  I need to go out this afternoon, I'm going to have to play a good, solid round of golf, though.  A lot of fairways, a lot of greens.
Q. Being four shots back, what else do you think it's going to take to kind of conquer this course in the final round?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I just need to keep playing like I am.  I feel like I'm playing really well.  I just need to go out and get a couple putts to drop.
Q. You've been very close to winning a Major.  What's it going to take?  What are you taking from this experience, near-misses in tournaments and obviously what happened last year that you think can kind of put you over the edge this year to win a Major?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, obviously, I've got to get off this afternoon.  So just need, like I said, to go out and play a solid, easy round of golf.  A lot of fairways, a lot of greens.
