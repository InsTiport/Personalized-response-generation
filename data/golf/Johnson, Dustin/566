  Q. Playing Riviera for the first time since a year ago, it looks like you've learned some things. Are you getting more comfortable each time you play it?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's like any golf course, the more you play it -- it suits my eye off the tee. Yeah, I'm getting more comfortable with it. I really like the golf course. It's in great shape. The greens are rolling really good.   
  
  Q. You've had a time now to sort of run through all of the courses now a second time. Have you picked up some favorites?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I don't know, any -- all of the golf courses play good, so I don't really have any favorites I guess other than the two places I've won at are obviously my favorites.   
 Good greens determines whether a golf course is really good or not.  
  
  Q. Ten greens but only 24 putts today. Were you able to scramble a little bit?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I didn't hit that many greens, but the ones I missed, from the collar or maybe just off the green -- so maybe the stats were not that good, but overall, I hit it very well. I hit a lot of good shots and maybe just rolled off on to the edge.   
 It was a pretty good day.  
  
  Q. Got another one left in you?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I do. Looking forward to tomorrow. Practice a little bit this afternoon, and ready.
