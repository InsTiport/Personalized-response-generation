Q. How would you assess your round out there?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I thought I played okay.  It was pretty difficult with the wind.  The wind was blowing pretty good.  It was tough to get a good bead on it.  But didn't hit quite as many fairways as I would like to.  But all in all I thought I played pretty solid.  Had a few good looks that I should have made.  But other than that, I think it was a pretty solid day.
Q. Are you surprised to see a lot of the big names not quite at the top of the leaderboard early on?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I mean it's tough.  This golf course, for one, you got to hit it in the fairway.  The fairways are generous but with the wind blowing the way it is today, it's tough to hit the fairways.  So and then you got to hit good shots coming into these greens if you want to have a good look at birdie.
Q. Is the course a little soft out there today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean it's soft, but it definitely started to firm up a little bit the later the day went.
