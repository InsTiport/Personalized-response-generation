Q. Your reflections on a second round 68 to leave you 5-under par for the tournament?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It was a bit more challenging today with the wind. I felt like I played pretty well. I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in the hole, but that's how it goes. I mean, yeah, I'd like to play a little bit better today, or shoot a little bit lower, really. I played all right considering the conditions. It was pretty tough out there, especially the last nine holes.
But I felt like I kept giving myself chances, and that's all you've got to do.
Q. Do you feel like 68 is the most could you have scored?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, that's probably about the highest. I missed quite a few short birdie putts.
Q. Some nice stuff on the back nine?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I played really well. Other than the drive on 18, I hit a lot of good shots. Just a little bit of lack of focus obviously. For the most part, I felt like I drove it really nicely. Hit a lot good shots. Gave myself a lot of looks at birdie.
Q. How well positioned do you think you are heading into the weekend?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm a few back, but you know, nothing a good score tomorrow can't take care of.
Q. How much are you looking forward to that challenge of defending your title?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I feel like I'm playing well enough to give them a run. See what happens tomorrow.
