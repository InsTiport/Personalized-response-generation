Q. 3-under today leaves you at 10-under.  What do you think?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean, you know, with the weather that's coming in tomorrow, supposed to be probably a little bit more wind.  The golf course is going to play fairly difficult.  But it's receptive to good shots.  If I can drive it in the fairway and hit some good shots, then yeah, you never know what can happen.  I definitely need to get the putter going.  I haven't really made too many putts this week.  But today I made a lot of nice five-footers for par, but I didn't putt it very well.  Really didn't do a whole lot that well today.
The first two days I felt like I played really good.  Today just a little bit off.  I mean, I still gave myself a lot of good chances, but yeah, I didn't drive it as good as I have been today.  But I still -- you know, I'm still right there in it.  I need to come out and play a good round tomorrow, though, especially with the conditions we're going to have.
Q. You got to 10-under today; that's five strokes back.  We had a lot of low scores out here today.  Do you still feel like you're in the mix?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I'm definitely in the mix, especially we've got some weather and some wind tomorrow, so anything can happen.  But yeah, I need to go out and shoot a really good score if I want a chance to win.  But I feel like I'm in the position where if I put a special round together tomorrow, then I've definitely got a chance.
Q. In your last start, you did get a win, but you were the 36- and 54-hole leader.  What kind of strategy do you take to this given that you are now trailing?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I mean, I'm going to have to play aggressive.  But this golf course, you've got to drive it in the fairway.  If you drive it in the fairway, you can attack the flag, and that's what I'm going to have to do tomorrow.
Q. Does the weather help or hurt you do you think?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, definitely it helps just because if you can put a really good round together, you've got more of a chance.
