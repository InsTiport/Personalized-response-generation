  Q. Do you always travel with a bunch of putters?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I try not to.  I like to tinker, but most of the time I stick with the same one I've got.  It's not the arrow, it's the Indian.
 Q. What are you looking for?  You said you're going to practice --
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Just practice.  Just hit my lines.  I feel like my speed is pretty good.  It's just not hitting it down the line.
 Q. First time we've seen you since the PGA.  What was your takeaway from that week?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I played really well.  I mean, I played solid.  Generally with the lead shooting 68 at a major on Sunday, nine times out of ten you're going to win.  Yeah, I mean, obviously Collin played really well that Sunday.
 I played really good, I just couldn't -- I had a lot of 20-footers and hit a lot of good putts, just --
 Q. The fact that you shot 68 object Sunday, does that make it get easier to get over?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's just one of those things.  They set the back nine up where you could attack it, but it was just tough to get in that mentality of attacking the golf course when you're playing defensively kind of all week.  But it was there.  I played solid.  Wasn't upset with it.  Obviously I would have loved to have won, but I played good, finished second, that's all right.  Made a nice putt on the last, though.
 Q. How are you approaching this three-week stretch?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I mean, what am I, 15th right now, so I'd like to move up a little bit going into East Lake.  I'm looking for some solid weeks here just to try to better my position going into the FedExCup Championship.
 Q. A lot of hubbub made over what Brooks said Saturday night at Harding Park.  Do you have any response to that, or what were your thoughts on it?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It doesn't matter.  It doesn't bother me.  He can think whatever he wants.
