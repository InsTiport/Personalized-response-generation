 Q.  What's your overall thoughts of that match?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was a really good match.  It was tough.  He just never, never gave me anything, and I gave him No. 2 and then No. 13, and that was kind of killer for me.  But yeah, it was a good match.   
I felt like I played pretty well.  Made some nice putts.  I knew it was going to be a tough match starting out.  I just didn't hit enough fairways.  I needed to hit it closer on 18.  I hit a couple poor iron shots but other than that, it was a good match.  It was a good day.   
 Q.  What's your overall thoughts of the week?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It's been a lot of fun, and you know, don't really know what's going to happen yet but looks like they are going to probably take the Cup, which, you know, it sucks.  I want to win.
