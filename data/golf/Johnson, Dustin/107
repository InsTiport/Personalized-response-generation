 Q.  A new course record, 61 today.  We thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  How much fun was it for you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was really good.  Obviously you always have fun when you're playing well, but yeah, I did a lot of the same things I did yesterday.  The greens rolled a little bit better today.  I felt like I paid a lot more attention to exactly what the putts were going to do and just kind of tried to make sure I just trusted the line that I was playing and made some putts today.  You know, drove it really well and gave myself a lot of opportunities.   
 Q.  When you birdied the sixth and seventh, having started at the 10th, you got to 9-under for the day, we're thinking birdie-birdie 59; is it going through your mind?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  I mean, I was trying to go birdie-birdie, but I never really thought about it.  I wasn't even thinking it was a par-70.  I was just trying to keep getting my score lower and lower.   
 Q.  You mentioned reading the greens a little bit better today; they putted a little better, too, they were a bit smoother?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: They were a bit smoother.  You know, they rolled better today.  They're still very tricky to read.  I hit a lot of putts today, a few short ones, too, that I missed.  But yeah, they're just tricky to read.  I felt like even today, shooting the score I did and making some good -- a lot of putts, I still had a lot of chances to just -- really hard reads.   
 Q.  Bryson DeChambeau is getting a lot of attention at the moment, particularly with his pre-shot routine.  He factors in every variable possible.  You seem to me like you just look up, see the shot, hit it.  Is that the process?  What's going through your mind?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I get a number, I see which way the wind is blowing and I hit it.  There's not really much factor involved.   
 Q.  24 hours before you'll play again; how will you spend that time?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm going to go eat some lunch right now, probably go to the gym and then come out here tomorrow morning and get ready.   
 Q.  How good was that round?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was very good.  I mean, I played really solid all day long, gave myself a lot of opportunities, and today -- I mean, it wasn't a whole lot different than yesterday except that I just holed some putts today.  I felt like I had a little bit better feel on the greens, just really would pick a line and made myself trust it, hit a lot of good putts, and a few of them went in.   
 Q.  You holed a nice eagle putt on 4.  Have you gotten used to these grainy greens?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I wouldn't say used to them.  I mean, I still misread a few short ones, but getting a little bit better feel on them, and yeah, really just trusting the grain and trusting that it's going to affect the putt.  That's the big key.   
 Q.  Does this course suit you?  They say it suits a long hitter.  Do you think it suits you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I like the golf course.  Keep driving it like the way I am right now -- I switched to the M6 driver this week, and I really like it.  I'm driving it really well right now, so if I keep hitting it in the fairway, I'm going to really like this golf course.   
 Q.  How does this round rank?  As one of your best rounds?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was a very good round.  I've played quite a few good ones, so I wouldn't say it was the best, but it was a low score.  I played really solid all day and gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Yeah, it was a very good round.
