Q. Two-time champion here now at the Saudi International.  How do you reflect on a very commanding performance over the past four days?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, it was a really good week.  I felt like I played really solid every day.  Gave myself a lot of chances.  Didn't putt quite as well as I'd like to, but obviously well enough to get a victory today.
But conditions were tough, especially a couple of the days, but I felt like I struck it very well.  I drove it really good.  So I gave myself a ton of chances.  But yeah, just obviously I'm very pleased with the win and very excited but I'm going to have to go home and work on the putting a bit I think.
Q. You won the Masters as world No. 1 and another victory as world No. 1.  How much satisfaction does that give to you win as the world's No. 1 golfer?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, it's tough to win on The European Tour, PGA TOUR, no matter what ranking you are.  But yeah, obviously winning as No. 1 is definitely good, and obviously it gives me a little bit more of a lead.  It gives me a lot of confidence going in for the rest of the year.  Obviously we're at the beginning of the year, so pleased with how I'm playing and looking forward to the rest of the year.
Q. Major championship; PGA TOUR victory; what does a stand-alone European Tour victory mean to you?  It's different, isn't it?
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Well, I've won here a couple years ago.  Finished second last year.  I like this golf course.  I like the tournament.  I think the Saudi Golf, they do a great job hosting us and put on a great event.  So obviously the field they have this year was really good, so it's a big win.
