  Q. Talk about your thoughts on who you're playing with, what you know about Aaron and Jason.   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Me and Kuch played today obviously. We are happy to play together. I think we are going to make a good team.   
 I was looking at it and we are going to have a tough match against Aaron and Jason, and playing here in Australia on their home turf, it's just going to be a tough match. This golf course is tough, so alternate-shot is going to be really very hard.   
  
  Q. You guys have very different games to the average person. Why do you think you gel well together?   
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well alternate-shot is real different in the strategy. Par is a good score, especially on this golf course. I think two guys that are opposite players match up well than like two guys that are very similar players. Say like two hitters, me and Bubba or me and Phil or something like that.  
  
  Q. So it's easy to figure who is going to hit on the par 5s and stuff like that in?  
 DUSTIN JOHNSON: I think it just matches up better when you have different games.
