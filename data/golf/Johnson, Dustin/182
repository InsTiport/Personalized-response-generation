Q. It looks like the American Team is very, very invested in these team events.  Give us a sense of how you feel about that statement.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah, I think the guys, we all enjoy playing these events, whether it's the Presidents Cup or The Ryder Cup.  You know, all the guys want to make the team.  We all want to play on the team.
We just have so much fun when we come here and do this.  It's a week like no other.  So I think all the guys really want to be on it.  We've got a young team.  I think we're going to be really good for a long time.
Q. How does it feel to have been a part of this?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: It feels good.  I had a really good week.  Obviously I'd like to get a win here in the singles, but I played good.  Branden played really well.  It was a tough match, but it was a lot of fun.
This whole week's been a lot of fun hanging out with all the guys all week.  We've got a really special team on the U.S. side.  I think we're going to be very good for a long time.
Q. What do you think has been the secret of your success?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: The guys are just good.  We tall trust each other.  We all believe in each other's abilities, and we all want to be here and we all want to win.
Q. You made it look easy.  Was it that easy?  How much resistance did the International Team offer?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No, it wasn't easy.  I know we made it look that way but it could have very easily flipped and gone their way, and it could have been dead-tied coming into singles.
But we had some stuff go our way.  It wasn't very easy.  We fought hard and we played hard.
Q. In The Ryder Cup over the years, the American Team has had it rough, but you guys look to really be clicking as a team and there's a real renaissance going on in American golf.  How optimistic are you for the future?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Very optimistic.  I think the guys, we're really looking forward to The Ryder Cup next year.  It's going to be very tough, though, playing on their turf, playing in France.  It's going to be very, very difficult.  But I'm really looking forward to making that team and going over there and playing.
