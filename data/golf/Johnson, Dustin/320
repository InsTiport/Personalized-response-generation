Q. 3-under 68, you love this place, you play here so well; today, did you feel like you could have had a few more?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Felt like I played pretty good today.  I missed a few short putts.  You know it's going to happen out here, though.  But yeah, a couple up-and-downs, they were fairly easy that I didn't get up-and-down.  I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in.  I had a lot of good looks from short range that I didn't make anything.  But overall, it was a good day.  I felt like I hit the ball well and hit it close to the hole.
Q. Is that just the poa annua late, it gets a little bumpy; was there any particular reason.
DUSTIN JOHNSON: The greens are soft, and late in the day.  Unfortunately it rained last night, because this golf course was probably the best I've ever seen it.  It was firm and fast.  It was going to play very difficult obviously with the soft greens.  Made it play quite a bit easier.  But you know, still the golf course is in great shape.  I felt like I played well today.  Just didn't get a lot out of my round but I'm still right there.  3-under par today, you're doing just fine.
