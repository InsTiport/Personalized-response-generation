  Q. I just worked out that you can go 60-60-60 and still can't get to 30-under par for the week.
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, but I would win.
 Q. That's true.  I think you opened 67 last week, which is a pretty good start, not your best.  Does it feel similar at all to being 71 given what you faced out there?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, you know, I felt like it was -- I didn't drive it well.  I didn't hit enough fairways.  I didn't drive it bad, I just didn't hit enough fairways, and this golf course you've got to play from the fairway if you want to stop the golf ball.  So tomorrow that's something that I need to hit a few more fairways.
 I feel like the golf swing is still -- I'm really comfortable with it.  I hit a lot of nice shots.  But then again, I didn't hit to hit too many from the fairway.
 Q. Why didn't you hit more fairways?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It's very difficult to hit the fairways out here.
 Q. Just because of wind?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, you get a lot of these holes crosswinds, and the ball is going really far, so the golf course is super firm, it's something that's just hard to judge exactly how far they're going to go.
 Q. Can it be a bit of a mind game when you go from a course that allows good scoring because of the conditions to a beast?  Can it play head games with you?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, I knew coming in playing my practice rounds here that it was going to be difficult, and it is.  It's fair, though.  It's a fair test of golf, but it's just hard.  It's not like -- there's nothing tricky really about it, it's just hard.  If you want a golf course to play tough, grow a little rough, make it firm and fast.  Every week, every golf course this firm and fast with a little bit of rough plays difficult.
 Q. This 71 today feels like what last week, 68?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   They're not comparable, but I'm happy with the score.  I'm right there.  It's going to be difficult every day.  If I can get my bad round out of the way today and play three solid ones the next couple days, I'll be all right.
