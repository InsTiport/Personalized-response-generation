EMILY TILLO: We'd like to welcome Dustin Johnson into the Interview Room.   
Dustin, you've had a pretty successful history here at the Byron Nelson, four Top-10s, 6 Top-25s.  So, obviously this course seems to fit your game well.  What about it do you like and what's your thoughts heading into this week?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I feel like I had a pretty good day today.  I'm starting to hit the ball a little better than I have the last couple of weeks.  That's definitely a positive.  This golf course I feel like it's -- it sets up well for me and I've liked it ever since I came here.   
Greens are really good, so you can make a lot of putts if you're hitting good shots.  But, yeah, I don't know.  I just always liked this course.   
EMILY TILLO: And you've now been atop the FedExCup standings for 8 weeks in a row.  Now we're in the second half of the season.   
What's kind of your game plan heading into the final stretch and the FedExCup Playoffs and the last bit of the season?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON: If I want to stay at the top, continue to play very good golf.  It's where I want to be leading into the Playoffs.  Still got a lot of really big golf tournaments to play and, you know, I'm going to have to continue to play very well.   
EMILY TILLO: Cool.  We'll open it up for questions.   
 Q.  I was curious if there's any lingering effects from your back injury and how you're feeling heading into this tournament.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  Back is a hundred percent good.  It has been the last two weeks.  You know, I just didn't -- even leading into Wells Fargo where I finished 2nd, you know, it was just kind of got around the course.   
It was playing tough and it was windy and, you know, just got around the course and kind of the same thing last week.  I wasn't really -- the back wasn't bothering me, didn't have any practice leading into the two weeks.   
So, you know, I've had to put in a lot of time in the last couple of weeks to try to get my form back to where it was and, you know, today is one of the first days where it felt like it's -- I felt like I was hitting some shots I was actually trying to hit.   
 Q.  On Monday you tweeted a picture of or a video from The Floridian, "Great practice session".  I wondered what you figured out there, what was so great about it?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  Just, you know, getting the reps in and, you know, I'm finally feel like I'm starting to hit the ball where it's supposed to go and, you know, it's just repetition.   
I mean I just hadn't -- even leading into, you know, Wells Fargo and last week, you know, no practice other than working at the tournaments but I finally, you know, the last couple of days I finally feel like I've starting to swing it a little bit better, have a little more control.   
 Q.  Curious if you've had a chance to see or experience Trinity Forest the course where it will be next year and your thoughts on it.  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I have not seen it so, yeah.  No thoughts.  Sorry (laughter).   
 Q.  You've obviously had a lot of success here as people mentioned it earlier here in this news conference.  
 What about this course will you miss and do you have a favorite memory from all your years here?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean I like the golf course.  Obviously I've done well here so I'll definitely miss that and then staying here on-site, you know, you can walk to the range or to the locker room and there's a great gym here.  It's a pretty good set-up and, you know, I like that.   
So, I'll definitely miss that next year.   
 Q.  Do you have a favorite memory as far as a shot or an experience?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: No.  Sorry.  I can't think of anything off the top.   
 Q.  DJ, you've had a good run now as No. 1.  Jason Day was talking earlier in the week about how it was almost -- or last week how it was overwhelming for him to wear that mantle being No. 1 for awhile.  Tiger seemed to really relish being in that role.  
 What's it been like walking in those shoes?  You had said it was never an explicit goal of yours.   
 Now that you've had it, what's it been like being the guy with the bullseye?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I like it.  Obviously it's why I play and why I practice and why I work so hard at the sport, you know, it's to be at the top.   
But, finally getting there and, you know, being here for awhile now, for me it drives me to work harder and, you know, to try to get better each and everyday.  So, you know, I enjoy being, you know, being here.   
 Q.  You haven't had the greatest success at TPC Sawgrass but you finished tied for 12th and had a really nice round on Sunday.  
 I'm wondering how much you gained from that week in terms of just where you were at and how much confidence you got playing well at a course that you haven't had the results, really?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Yeah.  It was my best finish I've ever had there so it was big and I didn't feel like -- I mean for me I felt like I played terrible.  Obviously I got it around but the ball was not going where I was wanting it to and, you know, just out there, you know, just grinding.   
It was tough for me last week.  I wasn't hitting it very solid, wasn't hitting great shots.  I just found a way to get it in the hole and -- but, you know, not feeling like I had definitely didn't have my best stuff, you know, to have a good finish definitely was huge and gives you a lot of confidence even though I wasn't playing that well.   
 Q.  Dustin, you've won a Major, No. 1 in the world.  What are the expectations and goals going forward now?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I mean I go into every week, you know, preparing, you know, to obviously I want to put myself in a position to have a chance to win the golf tournament.  Doesn't matter what tournament it is or where I'm playing it at.   
You know, I expect to compete every week.   
 Q.  Dustin, can you talk about preparation, how you plan to prepare for the 18th hole here at TPC Las Colinas?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Just all depends on the wind what I'm going to hit off the tee.  Today it's into the wind so I hit driver right at the bunker.  But, you know, if the wind switches and it's downwind, obviously I'll have to -- depending on which way it's blowing, whether I hit a layup with a 3-wood or 2-iron or something.  Just all wind-dependent.  It's a tough driving hole.   
EMILY TILLO: Dustin, we appreciate your time.  Good luck this week.
