  Q. Your second win here at the Saudi International, give us your initial reflections on today's round?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, obviously conditions when we started were really tough.  I knew I was hitting it well and I saw the leaderboard a little bit.  The guys were playing well, but I kept giving myself a lot of chances.  I didn't hole any of them but I kept hitting good shots.  I finally holed a really nice putt there on 13.  I just played solid all day.  Couldn't hole any putts today, though.
 Q. What was it you were struggling with, the line or the pace?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Just the reads.  I'd see it going right-to-left, it would go left-to-right.  I'd see it going left-to-right and it would go right-to-left.  Just misreading them a little bit.
 Like I said, I played really well.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Obviously 17 was a really nice birdie.  Hit a great drive there and a nice little chip.   It was tough all day today.
 Q. It's your ninth win on The European Tour and your first win since picking up the green jacket last November.  How important is it for you to prove that you're capable of winning around the globe?
 DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, I don't get to play around the world as much as I'd like to, but yeah, it's definitely nice to get a win not on my tour.  Obviously after Augusta, to get my first win again, obviously the game's still in really good form and I'm really excited about the rest of the year.
