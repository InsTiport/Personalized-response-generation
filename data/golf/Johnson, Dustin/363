 Q.   It's been a while since you've been here, off to a good start?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, a good, solid start.   Five birdies, no bogeys, played fairly solid.   I'd like to hit it a little bit better, but I hit some good shot, and I putted and chipped it pretty well today.  
   
 Q.   Any jogging of your memory of the last time you were here or is it too long ago?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Not much.   It was a long time ago, I've played a lot of golf courses since then.   But I played yesterday, so it jogged the memory a little bit, but I was pretty comfortable out there today.  
   
 Q.   I know the course is pretty soft, but did that factor into your game at all or was it okay?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   No, it was fine.   The fairways are really soft.   The greens are firming up a little bit, but the course is out there.   So you can go get it right now and be aggressive.   They've got some good pins be and you can fire at them.  
   
 Q.   Are these greens tough to read like that?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, there are a lot of little lumps and bumps on them.  
   
 Q.   Are you a hot player right now?   You had a really good year.   Would you say you're ‑‑ how would you characterize it?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   I think I'm playing okay.   I wouldn't say hot, but I'm playing pretty solid.   I'm pleased with it.   I feel like I could play a lot better.  
   
 Q.   I know you and Steve go back a ways to Pebble Beach.   What made the difference in coming here this year?   Did he wear you down?   
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, a little bit.   No, it fit my schedule this year for me.   I haven't been here in a while, so I just thought it was time to come back and play and have another go at it.  
   
 Q.   You said that you went to SouthCarolina (Indiscernible).   That didn't deter you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   It was a good game.   Unfortunately‑‑ (No Microphone).   But it was a fun game, and I enjoyed coming here and watching the game.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) you all are playing very well?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON:   Yeah, we all played soft.   We're used to playing it soft (Indiscernible).
