Q.   Tell me a little bit about your overall thoughts on your round today. 
BOB FRIEND:   Well, a little disappointing.   I played okay, I just hadn't 3‑putted all week and I 3‑putted twice today and just really one loose tee shot at number 18 which caused me to make a double bogey there. 
But other than that, I played pretty good.

Q.   And thoughts on being tied for low club pro?
BOB FRIEND:   Oh, I didn't know that.   I might get a cookie or something like that. 
No, I played on the PGA TOUR for five years and the, what's now called the web.com for nine.   I haven't competed for 10 years, so I guess it's okay. 
I'm not completely satisfied, I'm going to have a little bit of ‑‑ it feels like sauerkraut in my mouth right now, with the way that I finished.   But I played fine and just hopefully I'll get the opportunity to play next week in Iowa.
