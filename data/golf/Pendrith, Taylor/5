  TAYLOR PENDRITH:   It was a fun week.   I had three pretty solid rounds and one not so good round, but for the most part I had a lot of fun.   It was a great experience just being out here and experiencing what the guys experience every week, so I had a great time.   
   
 Q.   What did this week tell you about your game?  
TAYLOR PENDRITH:   Just told me that if I play good that I can play with these guys.   It's just like any other tournament; you don't play good, you don't make the cut; you play good, you can make the cut.   It just gave me a lot of confidence just to see that.   I'm not sure where I'm going to finish, but just to make the cut is pretty awesome.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you can use this tournament as a springboard?  
TAYLOR PENDRITH:   Absolutely.   This gives me confidence like I said, and I'm playing good golf right now, so the next couple weeks are pretty important tournaments for me in the amateur circuit.   Yeah, it gives me a lot of confidence.  
   
 Q.   What was your best memory of this week if you could pick just one?  
TAYLOR PENDRITH:   Probably the first day, seeing my name on the first page of the leaderboard is pretty awesome, just to shoot 65 first PGA TOUR round is good.   
   
 Q.   Anybody comment about your drives or anything like that?   
TAYLOR PENDRITH:   Yeah, quite a few people.  
   
 Q.   Guys you were playing with?  
TAYLOR PENDRITH:   Yeah.   I hit it far.  
   
 Q.   Surprised some people I guess?  
TAYLOR PENDRITH:   Yeah, I guess so, yeah.
