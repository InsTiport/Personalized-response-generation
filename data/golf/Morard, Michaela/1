Q. What kicked in at the end?
MICHAELA MORARD: It was mostly my approach shots because, well, I was struggling to get my driver and through it straight, too, so that was it, too, and then the back nine I started hitting them good because I figured out how to keep my foot down in my swing, which I wasn't on the front, and then I started hitting fairways, which gave me good shots into the green, and then I started just hitting them to like three or four feet and then making putts.
Q. How long were the putts on 15, 16, 17?  I saw the one at 18 was about six feet.
MICHAELA MORARD: Yes.
Q. What did you hit in there?
MICHAELA MORARD: Into 18?  I had a three-quarter 8-iron.
Q. 15?
MICHAELA MORARD: 15 was like -- because I went for it in two and then chipped it up to like two feet.  And then 16 was about four feet.  17 was about three feet, and then 18 was --
Q. So what were your clubs on 16 and 17?
MICHAELA MORARD: On 16, I had a 6-iron into the green.
Q. From?
MICHAELA MORARD: From like 155 because it was playing uphill.  And then on 17 I had 8-iron because it was 135 into the wind, and then on 18 I had 139, so I hit a three-quarter 8.
Q. You're from Alabama, so you're a little used to this type of conditions, the weather, the golf course, grasses, that kind of stuff.  Do you feel comfortable and at home playing here?
MICHAELA MORARD: Yeah, I did.  The weather aspect is a definitely a huge advantage because where I'm from, it gets so humid in the summer because it'll rain and then be so humid for the next week.  So I was used to that, which helped.
The fairways, we don't have these kinds of fairways where I play, but we have them where I live so I can get around to play on them sometimes.  And then I love fast greens, so I love putting on these.
Q. Have you played here before?
MICHAELA MORARD: No, I haven't.  When I went on my Mississippi state visit we drove the course but we never played it.
Q. Does the course suit your eye?
MICHAELA MORARD: Yeah, I love the way this course looks.  I was talking to my coach about it, too, but yeah, I really like the way the course looks.
Q. It's a match play event so you know the drill, you play in a lot of these things.  This does set you up pretty nicely for tomorrow where you don't feel like you've got to grind over everything?
MICHAELA MORARD: Yes, sir.
Q. And you're coming off a decent week at the Girls' Junior?
MICHAELA MORARD: Yes, sir.
Q. Second round you lost to Yuka?
MICHAELA MORARD: Well, I lost to Rose, but she was 8-under through 11.  I was like 3-under, so it wasn't bad.
Q. How do you beat somebody that's 8-under through 11?
MICHAELA MORARD: No, Rose is a great player, though.  I'm really good friends with her.
Q. Not here this week, she's at the Pan-Am Games.
MICHAELA MORARD: Yeah, I'll be watching her.
