Q. What are your thoughts on your starting round at St. Andrews?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: I'm pleased.   It's a good start, like you say.  I've been struggling a bit, so I was pretty apprehensive about today, so good start.  I hit some pretty good shots all the way around really in some tough conditions coming in.  So I put myself in a nice spot for the next three days.
Q. And how tough were those conditions, because it seemed fairly benign early on but the wind has picked up considerably?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: We expected it to pick up and also switch a little bit of direction and I think it did that.  We played the front nine sort of down off the right and then it switched to a little more off the left coming in, although it's still hurting.  With the wind blowing out-of-bounds on every shot, you're just hitting it left and trying to miss the bunkers.  There's four or five holes on that back nine where you're just trying to make pars really and I managed to do that for the most part.  Had a couple of 3-putts from the fringes which is a little frustrating.  I hit the ball well, which is the big positive for me.
Q. Tell us about the eagle at 10.
EDDIE PEPPERELL: I hit it short left probably 30 yards from the front of the green and the pin is just over the tier.  I didn't have a shot to putt it because I couldn't stop it chipping it, just hit the putter and rolled all the way in.  Yeah, gave the Pepper Army something to cheer about.
Q. There were plenty of people out to cheer.
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Yeah, which is great.  Quite a few come up from home which is great.  Pepper Army, yeah, that's a good name, I didn't make it up.
