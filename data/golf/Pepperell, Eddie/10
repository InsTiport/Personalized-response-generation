Q. How do you evaluate that performance?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: It was okay.  It was windy.  I think it was still very doable out there.  Crosswinds for most of the course.  It was really a case of, I often find links courses play easier when it's crosswinds as opposed to up and down the course, but that's probably me.  So I didn't find it -- I didn't think it was too difficult, but it was tricky.
Q. Different direction of the wind, as well.  You say lots of crosswinds.  Is it something that you relish the opportunity tomorrow for it to blow again?  Is that something you'd hope for with an opportunity tomorrow?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: I don't know.  I probably do need it to, if I want to have any chance of winning.  I don't know if I'm swinging it well enough to shoot the right score in those conditions.  I kind of want to have a fun day on the links tomorrow.  I guess that's what I want right now.
You know, I think the forecast is pretty nice tomorrow, so I expect a lot of low scores tomorrow, and you know, I think this course will be very gettable tomorrow.
Q. Just finally, just give us a sense of what it's like playing here in these crowds, as well.  It's a sell out.  What has the support like for you?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: It was great.  Awesome crowds.  The first two days with Tommy and then right next to him today in the draw, brilliant.  It's always a pleasure to come play in the U.K. and they certainly know how to support an event, so all credit to them.
