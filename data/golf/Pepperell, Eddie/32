 Q.  A second successive 68, no dropped shots today.  Give us your assessment to the final day?  
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Boring, really.  Frustrating, instead of boring, obviously on Sunday, being in contention.   
I played steady.  I had my chances.  I stuck to my game plan.  Yeah, if I had holed a couple of putts, easily could have shot 5-under par and end up finishing second.  You know, it's a good week, another good week.  I'm playing well.  Hardly any negatives to be quite honest with you and a lot of positives.   
 Q.  Is it days like today where the mental side of the game kicks in because you have to stay focused when things are not going as you'd like?  
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Yeah, and I actually had kind of a similar round last week in Holland.  I was getting a bit frustrated at the start of the final day.  Felt like I was making the putts I could have and I ended up -- stayed very patient.  Ended up making a few birdies to finish with and had a good finish.   
That helped, and Nick was great, again.  Reminded me to stay patient and there's going to be lots of birdie opportunities to come.  Unfortunately they didn't drop for me today but I'm generally pleased.   
 Q.  The game is in great shape at the moment and now moving forward, you can start building on this and get that momentum towards the end of the season.  
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Exactly.  I'll be in next week now.  I'll play the Dunhill Links.  There's lots of golf to play in climates and courses I'm more suited to with my body fat.  Yeah, I've got lots to look forward to.
