EDDIE PEPPERELL: It's so difficult out there.  I guess it was a good thing, not being a birdie-fest.  It was just a pure grind from the get-go, and I didn't play very well, but you know, what can I say, yeah, shows how important it is to build a lead I think.
Q. Really gutsy, given the fact that you lead wire-to-wire, to see it through.  That must give you so much satisfaction?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Yeah, yeah, it does.  It's tough sleeping on it.  I didn't sleep too well the last couple nights.  My mind was very active, especially with all the stuff after the hole-in-one, the social media, it's hard to avoid that, and I never try to avoid it.  I always try to confront it.  You know, challenging week.  But I'm just delighted, really.
Q. You told me to wait until you had won the trophy, but how does it feel to win on British soil, and a championship that has so many great names to it for British golf?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Yeah, ideal, really, especially Justin hosting it, beautiful course, love it.  Really nice moving into the rest of the year.  Off the back of last week, this is a surprise.  I'm thrilled to have won, really, British Masters is iconic.
Q. From the British Masters to the Masters, because now you're certainly going to end this year in the Top-50, and we know what goes with that.
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Yeah, that's brilliant.  I said that to Mick on the last, lots to look forward to next year, really, to be frank.  So looking forward to seeing the dog in the morning and giving him a big cuddle.  He doesn't know what's happened.
Q. But I'm sure you'll tell him.
EDDIE PEPPERELL: I'll tell him by the way of a bone or something like that.  I'm sure he'll know something's happened.
