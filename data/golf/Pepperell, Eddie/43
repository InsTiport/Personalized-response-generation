 Q.   What got you around that very difficult golf course?   
EDDIE PEPPERELL:   My putter I think.   I played well, no question, but I had to putt really, really well, so I would have to put it to putting for no bogeys.   Whilst today was very difficult, I didn't feel‑‑ just hung in there.   I said to myself, anything in the 60s would be a really good score at the start of the day.   Good round of golf.   
   
 Q.   You were seven behind at the start of the day.   At what point did you think you might win?   
EDDIE PEPPERELL:   Not at any point really.   I saw the leaderboard back at 17, and I figured that would be an important putt to make.   That's the only time that I realised‑‑ surprised to see the leaders come back as much as they have but obviously when you are playing with as good a player as he is and he's struggling‑‑  
   
 Q.   Tied for the clubhouse lead, not going anywhere, are you?   
EDDIE PEPPERELL:   No.
