Q. You carried two 3-woods this week -- changed up at the last moment?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Yeah, the rain woke me up at 4.00am and I couldn't get back to sleep and I knew I was going to have to hit driver.  I used it on the third and I didn't use it again actually.
So yeah, I mean, we had a major change of bag, really.  I think at one point I had about 18 clubs in there and we had to decide.  I went from four wedges to three wedges, removing two.  It was all going on.
And the wrist was playing up a little bit on the range.  I felt it a bit.  To be honest I was going out there not knowing what to expect.
Q. What brought that on?  You had to miss the Pro-Am yesterday because of the wrist.
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Well, it's been playing up for a while.  I had a scan last week and my scan is not right in my right wrist but it was just too late to have an injection.  Just try to get through it as best we can.
It's just one of those things that flares up a little bit out there and just have to hope that I don't have to grip a club for five minutes.
Q. It's early in the week but our favourite stat already is that you are No. 1 in the world into approach play everywhere.  You've got to finish off those chances; how much more difficult, or how different was it out there today, every part of the game based on these conditions?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: It was totally different.  That was a 4-iron in there.  I hit my 3-wood in the trees.  A shame you didn't get to see the shot -- I mean, you have to make the best.  It was at least three or four par 4s where you're going in with at least a 5-iron.  Tough course.  Anything under par is a good score.
