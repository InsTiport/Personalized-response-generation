Q. You came out in positive fashion and a couple early birdies got you off to a great start?
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Yeah, other than kind of the crazy 3-putt I had on hole No. 7 maybe where I missed another short one, it was good golf to be honest.
Q. Great eagle on 15 today.  You know the extra couple of shots has helped elevate you up the leaderboard.  Not quite going to be enough but in terms of ranking points, that was an important hole.
EDDIE PEPPERELL: Yeah, definitely.  I didn't know the leaderboard.  Gin the situation.  Decided to hit driver off the tee because I wasn't hitting anything straight at that point, so I thought I might as well hit driver, and hit a great one, and 8-iron to ten feet and knocked it in.
Great time to do that, obviously.  A shame I couldn't make one or two coming in.  It would have been nice to hole one on 17 or 18.  The game didn't feel immaculate today.  So 67 is good.  Like you say, it's another Top-10, and while I'm getting a bit sick of that and not winning, it's not a bad place to be.
Q. Your best performance in a Rolex Series event after the tied 10th in Italy, so you're taking good form into the last two events of the year, as well.
EDDIE PEPPERELL: I'm definitely trending.  They might give me a watch soon if I keep doing what I'm doing but I doubt it.  Played three this year and every time they have got better.
Looking forward to the Nedbank.  Haven't been there before, and obviously Dubai will be great to be there.  My whole family is coming out and a lot of people from home.  We can celebrate, and yeah, two lovely events to finish the year.
