Q.  What do you think of the course conditions right now with all the rain we have had and everything?
DANA QUIGLEY:  The rain is no problem on the course.  It's soggy, but it's no problem with the golf shots at all.
Q.  How about the greens?  The speeds?  Did it slow them up a good bit?
DANA QUIGLEY:  Well, I don't know how fast they were before.  But the PGA would probably like to have them a little bit quicker.

But without any drying conditions I don't think that's going to happen.
Q.  Overall the venue, do you like it?
DANA QUIGLEY:  Couldn't be better.  It's perfect.
