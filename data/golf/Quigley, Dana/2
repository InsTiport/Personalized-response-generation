Q.  Tough four days out there.  You held it together, even par today.  You knew where the leaders were at the whole time, they were in your group, just couldn't get any electricity in your round today.
DANA QUIGLEY:  Well, what happened is I hit a perfect shot on 2 and it ended up in the water.

I hit a really good 9 iron on 8, the par 3 over the water, hit the bank right on line with the pin and came back in the water.  And I had, I made 5, 5, I was 4 over after 8, really hadn't hit any bad shots.  And Jay just came off of five birdies in a row, so it was kind of like he was gone.  He was 10 shots ahead and I just really just tried to put my nose to the grind stone and play a solid back nine for placement.  I didn't think I could catch, but I almost, as it turned out I was pretty close to catching him.
Q.  Certainly you said you had a couple of good shots early?
DANA QUIGLEY:  And it went in the water.
Q.  And you had a poor result.  But other than that you felt pretty good the way you finished?
DANA QUIGLEY:  I'm very, very happy to get in here 2 under in these conditions on this hard golf course.  At almost 60 years old I'm very happy with it, believe me.  It's just another great thrill for me.
