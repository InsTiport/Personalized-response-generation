Q.
Let's start off with the fog delay this morning.  What did you do to get through that?
DANA QUIGLEY:  It actually didn't affect us at all.  We were fine.  The guys that had to play at 6:50 had the biggest hardship.  Because they got shuffled to last.  So they went from 6:50 to 10:35.  I know there were a few disgruntled guys this morning, but it takes a lot more than that to get me mad.
Q.  Let's talk about your birdie birdie finish this morning.
DANA QUIGLEY:  Yeah, I was pretty luck.  I hit a great 5 iron on 17 to close and had a    the greens were really soft.  I had a pretty good sized heel print in my way and somehow the ball maneuvered around it and got in there.

And then 18 I hit just a terrible first putt and I thought it was really quick going down there.  Left it 15 feet short and somehow slapped that one in.  So I was pretty much prepared to accept the 3 putt on 18, but the ball went in so that's good stuff.
Q.  What are your plans for this afternoon?
DANA QUIGLEY:  Same plans.  Going to go out and just play this golf course.  You got to    in my opinion, you got to    I got to attack it.  But to play it well you got to be aggressive and force that ball down in there and go for it.  I'm just going to keep going for it.  If it happens it does, if it doesn't, I got another tournament tomorrow starting.
