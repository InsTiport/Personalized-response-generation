Q. Yeahlimi, what a great round.  How do you feel having the three rounds in?
YEAHLIMI NOH:   I feel good.  I played all right today.  I didn't play as well as I hoped and the last hole really sucked, but overall it was good.  Yeah.
Q. Is Cambia one of your favor tournaments?  Because last year you also played really well.
YEAHLIMI NOH:   Yeah, uh-huh.
Q. What is it about this course that you love so much?
YEAHLIMI NOH:   Yeah, I definitely love the course and like the area in general.  Portland is so nice.  Today we had amazing weather, which is so great.  I really like the setup of the course.  It's pretty narrow.  I really love the grass.  It's always so flush and just amazing here.
They keep it in really good shape.
Q. Your game is really good.  What are you thinking about in terms of the rest of the 2020 season?  Which tournaments are you thinking about going to?
YEAHLIMI NOH:   So my next event is ShopRite and then KPMG.  I'm going to play everything I can play obviously because of this year.
But, yeah.
Q. After this tournament is there anything in particular you want to work on?
YEAHLIMI NOH:   Uh-huh, yeah.  My putting for sure.  It's getting there, but it can be better.  Yeah.
Q. Lastly, your mom was out there.  How does it feel to have her there supporting you, especially because there aren't any fans?
YEAHLIMI NOH:   Oh, yeah it's good.  Feels really familiar because she was always there watching since junior golf, so it feels nice to have her there and clap sometimes.
