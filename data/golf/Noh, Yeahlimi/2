Q. How do you put the week into words, what you were able to do this week?
YEAHLIMI NOH: I'm just overall really happy with how I played and how I finished, too.  It was my goal to be inside the top 10 for this week, and I'm really happy with how I finished.
That bogey was just -- it happens, but I'm really happy with who I got to play with and how I played.
Q. You really were thinking top 10 when you got here Sunday knowing you had to qualify just to make the field?
YEAHLIMI NOH: Every qualifier I play, even when I missed it, I'm like, If I made it I know I can play well.  Just this week when I finally made one I just had a lot of confidence that I could play well.
Q. Played with the world No. 1; Amy Yang on the weekend.  What do you think you learned from them on how they conduct themselves out here?
YEAHLIMI NOH: Yesterday playing with the No. 1 player in the world was a bit nerve wracking, just seeing how composed she was and really like expressionless.  Just little things like skill-wise I was really impressed.
And then I had a really great time with Amy today.  Talked a lot.  It was all fun.
Q. Score aside, did the week exceed your expectations?
YEAHLIMI NOH: Yes, yes, it did.  Just based on the course and stuff, I was happy with my number this week, yeah.
Q. See what Patty did today, too?
YEAHLIMI NOH: Yeah.  Yes, I did.  Before I went off I saw that.
Q. Feel bad for the UCLA team all of a sudden.
YEAHLIMI NOH: No, I think she's repping them well.  Yeah.
Q. Did you feel like today you had a lot of support out there?  Maybe people came in not knowing who you were and by the end of this tournament you probably had a good share of fans out there.
YEAHLIMI NOH: Yeah, for sure.  I am really grateful for everyone that cheered me on.  It was great today.
