PAUL CLAXTON:  It was nice, I got off to a good start, made a lot of putts today.  And the golf course is just in great condition.  Put those factors together with nice weather, and it was a good day for me.  Best round of the year.
Q.  Was there a point in the round you really knew you had things going?
PAUL CLAXTON:  Well, you never really know.  (Laughing).  The fairways are so tight out here, you can get in trouble on every hole.  You try not to ever think that you've got it going and just enjoy it and play one shot at a time.  That's kind of the way I look at it.
Q.  Best round of the year, what's the difference between the last two days and coming in?
PAUL CLAXTON:  I've been making a lot of birdies with a lot of bogeys and today I managed to stay away from the bogeys.  I had a double today, but other than that, maybe one bad swing, I played pretty solid all day.
Q.  Did you just hit the ball better or putted better?
PAUL CLAXTON:  Probably the best putting I've had all year, so that's a good thing.
Q.  Maybe you can play like this tomorrow?
PAUL CLAXTON:  You never know.  These guys, there's a lot of birdies out there.
Q.  At the very least you get to sleep in a little?
PAUL CLAXTON:  Right, it will be a little later tee time tomorrow but it was fun today, I enjoyed it.
Q.  Did you hit some bombs out there?
PAUL CLAXTON:  I did.  I made two real long putts for birdie.  No. 1, I made about a 30 footer for birdie on 1, and 14, I made about a 30 footer for birdie.  Two poor chips, but I made the two long putts and that really kept my momentum going and I birdied 14.

I was in perfect shape on 1 and hit a bad chip.  I had not made a long putt like that, so that got me off to a good start.
