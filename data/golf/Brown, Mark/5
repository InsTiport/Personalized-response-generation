 Q.  Just your comments about your first time in this KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship and having a chance to extend it a little further.  
MARK BROWN: It was tons of fun.  Playing with some of these guys that I grew up idolizing and then to play with some of them was kind of cool.  Then to make the cut was really kind of cool.  To try and go for the low club professional was really nice, too, but my putter just let me down all week.   
 Q.  You had been hitting it well, right?  
MARK BROWN: Yeah, I actually hit it pretty good all week, it's just my putting, I couldn't make anything.  I couldn't read the greens right.  My speed was pretty good, it was just we didn't make anything all week.   
 Q.  Did you have a chance on 18?  
MARK BROWN: No, no, I blocked it right and chipped it out, hit it in the bunker and I had to make a 4-footer for par so I didn't really have a shot.   
 Q.  I understand your plans are to get into the U.S. Senior Open?  
MARK BROWN: Yes I'm going down to Maryland June 12th.  Argyle Country Club.  We're going to try to one day, try and get in the U.S. Open up in Boston.  So that will be pretty cool, too.   
 Q.  Do you know the course fairly well?  
MARK BROWN: I went over there on Tuesday here.  Played with someone over there and we went around there.  It's a short course, but kind of tricky.  And there was three spots, so something to look forward to get back out here with these guys.   
 Q.  Is it Caves Valley?  
MARK BROWN: Argyle Country Club.
