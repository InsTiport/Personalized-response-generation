MARK BROWN:  I was watching some of the other guys I was playing with.  Bob Estes, he hit just kind of shot to shot, and playing with Dean Wilson, too, it was fun.  Seeing Dean, coming off a win, obviously wasn't the straightest guy out there today but he somehow pieced it together to shoot I think a couple over.

So it was nice.  It was nice being out here with people and didn't hurt anybody, so I was good, too.
Q.  Do you have anybody here with you?
MARK BROWN:  I've got a bunch of family:  my parents, my sister, my niece, my wife, my brother's caddie, so there are a bunch of people out here.
