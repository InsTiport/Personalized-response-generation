   MARK BROWN: Struggled tee-to-green, especially the last nine holes. I know the weather wasn't great, but even before the weather came, I wasn't playing well tee-to-green. 
 Wasn't that comfortable with my swing, and towards the end of the round when you are under, you are aware of where you're sitting, but like last week, I just hit a number of poor shots. So obviously something in the technique is letting me down there. 

 Q. Certainly over those back holes, the rain was coming down, and so cold, as well. 
 MARK BROWN: Yeah, the weather only had an effect on the last hole for us. Before that we had the odd shower and a little bit of wind, but it was only the last hole where it was really coming in, so I can't blame that. We actually probably got a little bit lucky because the wind died down and we got a little bit of rain but it wasn't too bad.

 Q. Still two days ago, just don't know whether the weather is going to hold. 
 MARK BROWN: I would like it to blow. I grew up in that, so I would be confident in that. It's just a matter of whether the balls will stay on the greens and it's playable. So, we'll find that out tomorrow.

 Q. A little work to figure out what it is that's letting you down?
 MARK BROWN: Yeah, I just don't know what it is, and it's really disappointing, because the times when you really want to be in control of your ball and your ball flight, it's let me down the last two weeks.
