 Q.  Your experience here at Oak Hill?  
MARK BROWN: It's been great.  The people up here are great.  The golf course is in fantastic shape.  And just kind of -- you know, couple days, practice rounds were good, first round didn't hit it that great.  Second round hit it better.  Today I didn't hit it very well.   
But the short game is kind of keeping me in it.  Putting really well.  That hole-out bunker shot the other day was kind of nice.   
But just trying to -- you know, hole by hole.  One mistake today.  I tried to go for a par 4 out of the rough, and I hit it in the water.   
 Q.  You didn't get any big problems today.  
MARK BROWN: No.  Today, hit it in the water, I probably should have laid it up.   
 Q.  Which hole in the water?  
MARK BROWN: 5.  Yeah, I didn't have a best lie.  I thought it could get it up there.  But that's the only shot I'd take back.
