 Q. What was your assessment of a pretty good day on the golf course?
 MARK BROWN: Yeah, it's nice to get out there early. The last two days of practice have been pretty windy and cold, and some of those par 4s, we were hitting 3-iron into yesterday and only 9-iron or wedge today, so it was a massive difference. It was perfect conditions, different golf course totally. 
 I didn't play here last year, so it's my first real look at it. But just played nice and steady.

 Q. Impressions of the place?
 MARK BROWN: Yeah, it's good. Totally different light today with the sun out and real lack of wind. I think this island, probably it will blow before the week is out and that will provide a different challenge.

 Q. Does that put more importance on today's score?
 MARK BROWN: Possibly. It's good to be in with that nice and early, and sit back and relax and try and build on that tomorrow afternoon. 

 Q. The form is good, isn't it? Played well last week?
 MARK BROWN: The last two or three tournaments I've started to play a little bit better and get my confidence up a little bit; to peak for a Major in July back in Europe, it's a step in the right direction.

 Q. Has it been lacking, the confidence?
 MARK BROWN: Yeah, a little bit. I didn't play well for a good few months, and just lost it a little bit. But it doesn't take much to get it back. 

 Q. Why is that? 
 MARK BROWN: Oh, you just hit a few good shots and I'm the type of person that the only way I can gain confidence is by actually seeing the proof, not by trying to kid myself. When you start to see the ball fly a little bit straighter, then you slowly gain confidence. 

 Q. Nice bottle of Ballantine's, as well. 
 MARK BROWN: It is, for a 2 on 17. I'll enjoy that next week.
