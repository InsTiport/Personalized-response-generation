Q.  Mr. Tettleton, this is kind of an interesting career transition for yourself.  When were you first approached about the idea or for caddieing and what were your initial thoughts when you were asked about it?
MICKEY TETTLETON:  Well, I first went with Rick the first time he went to Q School.  And first of all I was honored that he would even consider me doing it and having enough respect for our friendship to do it.  And I think more than anything that's just it, our friendship.  I mean, he kind of knows if he gets upset he can bark at me and it's not going to bother me.  But it's just nice to be out here with him.  I don't do it a whole lot, but it's fun to be out here.
Q.  What about being a caddy has presented the most challenges for you?  You're probably learning at it every day, every time you come out here.  What challenges are you facing coming into that you weren't aware of initially?
MICKEY TETTLETON:  Well, I think that probably knowing what to say and when to say it has probably been the biggest thing.  I think that if anything I may be a little bit passive, but as Rick said, it's basically, he's got the final decision, I do appreciate the fact that he trusts me enough for reads on putts and yardages and stuff like that, but it's basically the same thing.  Pitcher/catcher relationship, it's his decision.
Q.  You don't have any problems with being the most famous caddy out here?
MICKEY TETTLETON:  Well, I don't know about that.
Q.  It is your home course?
MICKEY TETTLETON:  Yeah, I'm a member here and it's really been fun to take this, to watch this whole thing come together and then to    you don't really think about it when you're out there, but once it's kind of over with and you realize that you had the opportunity to be inside the ropes at a Major championship, that's pretty cool.
