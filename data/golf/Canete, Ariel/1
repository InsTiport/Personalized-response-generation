   ARIEL CANETE: I played well today. Still my putter helped me a lot, but I'm confident, playing nice.   
  
  Q. The course certainly seems to suit you, 10-under par after two rounds?  
 ARIEL CANETE: Yes, well, I think that when you have the preferred lies, short game is a lot easier, so good scores. But the course is nice.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like you could have shot a lower score today?   
 ARIEL CANETE: No, no. I didn't play that well, between 6 and 13, 14. I missed a lot of shots, but my lob-wedge helped me. No, 69, it was a very good score.   
  
  Q. Tell us a little bit about your medical exemption. What injury have you had?   
 ARIEL CANETE: I had the subscapularis tendon in my shoulder, it was cut, so they fixed a year ago. I didn't play last year. It was very painful after the surgery, and now I have the full exemption for this year.   
  
  Q. How difficult is it to come back from an injury?   
 ARIEL CANETE: It's difficult. I love more than I thought after I start again. My shoulder was with tendonitis again, and it's hard, because you think you are okay, and then the pain comes and it's very hard.
