  Q. 7-under, that's going to be one of the best scores, particularly this afternoon?  
 ARIEL CANETE: Yes, well, I played consistently, and the putter was very good today. So comfortable, nice day.   
  
  Q. Am I right in saying that you're on a medical exemption at the moment; is that right?   
 ARIEL CANETE: Yes, had an injury last year in my shoulder, didn't play all year, so they gave me the category three, so, yes, a full exemption for this year.  
  
  Q. And how is the shoulder now?  
 ARIEL CANETE: At the moment it's good. I had some tendonitis last no Mo and now it's okay.  
  
  Q. In Abu Dhabi you had a good finish there; what's been going on the last few months?   
 ARIEL CANETE: Well, it was a little bit unlucky in the shoulder, a little bit of pain, I have to say, but it's okay now.   
  
  Q. So hopefully a pain-free week the rest of the three days coming up and a good finish for you?   
 ARIEL CANETE: Yes, I hope so, and well, my wife is with my babies over there.   
  
  Q. How old is the baby?   
 ARIEL CANETE: 2 1/2 months, our first.   
  
  Q. How is fatherhood?   
 ARIEL CANETE: It's difficult to explain but it feels great.
