  BERND WIESBERGER:   I've had a good start to the round.   4‑under after six, good start, but then I found trouble with the pace and the birdies kind of went away, so lots of pars and fortunately I holed a long one on 15 to go to 5‑under.   Should have made a couple more, maybe get the pace tomorrow, maybe get quicker greens tomorrow morning.   
Otherwise, good start to the week.   
   
 Q.   Presumably you came here in a good frame of mind after the performance last year?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, obviously I've had good memories of last year.   I played decent up until the last couple holes.   But yeah, definitely a course I like and definitely a course I can see myself doing well.   Yeah, very happy and looking forward to a calmer round tomorrow morning.  
   
 Q.   You do look back on it as good memories; wasn't one that got away?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   Of course it was one that got away, but just getting myself into position and a course that I like, it's maybe kind of‑‑ where I got well and got myself into position again this year, and yeah, so just try to figure that and take the good memories.   Of course, I made some bad decisions at the end of the round last year, which kind of got me out of the winner's circle maybe, but played well, like the course and it's good enough for me.
