  BERND WIESBERGER:   Very disappointed after just a couple of minutes after we finished but, you know, it's a Top‑5 and a lot of positives there.   I felt all day it didn't go my way early on.   Putts didn't drop all day really.   Kept the odd par putt.   Yeah, you needed a little bit of luck, as well, to get some breaks and I didn't have that today. 
Yeah, stupid mistakes on the last two holes, that was probably not the way I should have finished this tournament, because I played nicely, and another one gone.   But still a couple of big tournaments ahead and moving up.   I think I've made my goal to make it to The Open next year, Top‑30 in the rankings, so that's a positive.   Yeah, going back home tomorrow, relax a bit and looking forward to China.

Q.   Last holes, was it just trying to force it just that little bit to make sure you were right in at the end? 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Well, you know, I had good chances on 14, 15, didn't make them.   Made a good safe on 16, and looking back, it hit the wrong club into the green on 17 and really should have gone for the flag and beyond.   You always have a shot from behind the green, never had a shot from the water, so that was an error there. 
So to finish the tournament with a 3‑putt is never good, because I felt I made two good shots, and yeah, just not my day.
