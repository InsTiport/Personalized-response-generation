BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, got a bit sloppy on the back nine I have to say, left a couple of shots out there but all in all a good start here.  Was able to take advantage of a couple holes just before the turn, some good short game in there.   
 Q.  Nice to do it in the rain conditions?  You had rain; you had cold.  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, it was really cold.  It was a bit of a breeze there.  The wind picked up, but all in all it evened out.  Just trying to stay warm, especially early on.  Made scoring a bit tough.  Took advantage after that.   
 Q.  How straightforward is it to make the transition from playing links golf to playing on a parkland like this?  
BERND WIESBERGER: We are playing all around the world and different kind of courses and setups.  Obviously you have to be a bit more creative around links golf but here it's kind of darts towards the flags again.  Greens are nice and receptive.
