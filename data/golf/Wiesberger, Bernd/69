  BERND WIESBERGER:   Finished third now, second Top‑10 of the year with Abu Dhabi.   Definitely good.   I gave myself a bit too much work after the first three holes where I hit it a bit badly.   Came back nicely, but I was leading then. 
Gracey just pulled it off on the back nine.   He hit a couple of good putts on 12 and obviously on 14 which got him going, and then made the tournament‑winning shot on 16.   It was great for him and good for me to finish with a birdie and top three this week.   Definitely a lot of positives.

Q.   I guess it felt like a kick in the stomach at the time on 16, didn't it. 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Well, he made a great shot.   Great 2.   Nothing wrong with that.   We both challenged for the tournament and he pulled off a great shot.   That takes some fortune, as well, but it was right on line all the way and a great putt.   I have nothing against it. 
Unfortunately i made a bit of a mess on 16, same as yesterday but that's how it is.   Finished nicely and on to next week.

Q.   Must be good just to be competitive and up there and have a victory chance. 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Somebody told me at the beginning of the week taking 17‑under, I would have taken that, and quite happy with what I did.   And yeah, it's just a lot of positives to take on for next week.
