Q. It was one of these days where you look at the card and you are going boy, that's not great golf.  It's match play and you came up with the point.  That's all that counts.
BERND WIESBERGER: That's what it is.  At the end of day, we both didn't have a great day.  I think we only made three birdies between us, which is not a lot out here.  He gave me a couple of holes, I gave him a few.  At the end of the day, I'm glad that I prevailed and got a win.
Obviously it wasn't his best day.  It wasn't the best of my days.  I think we both have to do a little bit of work this afternoon.
Q. He was playing so poorly, you were actually a couple up and he scored the match with a couple of wins on that back side.  Made it interesting for you.  But you were able to come through.  Just talk about your mindset as he squared the match up but you were able to still win?
BERND WIESBERGER: I went back and forth.  I have never played with DJ, so I can't -- I wasn't really knowing what to expect.  But he had a couple of off shots, gave a hole on 3 with a tee shot into the water, and then two out of bounds, which is quite unusual for him.  I knew I had to barrel it out.  He's not the No. 1 player in the world for nothing.  That back nine suits him and I saw him play well last year and winning this championship.  So I knew I had to play well.  I still didn't play great but somehow managed to get it through and just happy with that.
