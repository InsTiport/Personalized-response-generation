Q.   Your thoughts on getting back into this competition in some good style?
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, I've been up there in the round the last couple of days.   Unfortunately had some bad finishes to the rounds on Thursday and Friday, but I played well today.   A couple of important scrambles, as well, on the back nine, and got a couple of breaks, as well.   Chipped in on 13 and a longer putt on 16, which got the round where it should be, and yeah, just happy with the outcome today.

Q.   When you're making birdies on this course, must feel good?
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, I had 13 in the first two rounds, which is a lot around here, so I know my striking is really high when I hit the greens and just tried to do that today. 
Yeah, I got off to a good start, birdied the first, and was 1â€‘under around the turn and a nice solid back nine with a couple of good putts.   Quite happy with my round today. 

Q.   Am I right to presume you still fancied your chance at the halfway stage, albeit off the lead but still with opportunities? 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, the stretch on 14 is quite dangerous and you never know what's going to happen. 
Even if I'm a couple back, I'm playing decent on Sundays lately and I hope I can bring that kind of form into tomorrow, as well, and then you never know around this course.   It can chew you up and spit you out just as quickly as it can give you some birdies.   So you have to be alert, be focused and sometimes par is a really good score around here.
