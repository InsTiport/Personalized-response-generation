  Q. Assess your win today.
 BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, I mean I tried to go out there and play a little bit more freely, have a bit more fun than yesterday.  I played pretty awful there yesterday, all day really.  So just tried to reset a little bit overnight, get a couple thoughts in and have fun out there.  Played decent, got a couple of good breaks and I was able to win today, which was obviously a nice win against Viktor.
 Q. What was maybe the biggest key to your win today do you think?
 BERND WIESBERGER:   I holed a couple nice putts.  I grabbed a couple of holes unexpectedly, like on 10, also 9 and 8.  I just maybe got a little bit of benefit from mistakes from Viktor which I could take advantage of.  I played the par-5s well today for most of the day and, yeah, I did just enough to get it over the line.
 Q. What's your mindset heading into tomorrow with the hopes of moving on?
 BERND WIESBERGER:   We'll see how it goes.  Obviously I think Abraham is 2-up walking up the 16th.  Obviously for me to be able to progress I need to win my game first and foremost, and if I can do that we'll see what happens.  Obviously I need help from Viktor tomorrow, but that's out of my control, so just try and do the same thing as today, hopefully get a win in tomorrow and then see what happens.
