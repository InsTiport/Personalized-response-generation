BERND WIESBERGER:   No winds out there really, so just played poor to not pick up a couple more shots.  So even though I'm in a good position, quite disappointed with the last quarter of my holes that I've played this week.
Q. What do you know, then, to improve over the weekend?
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, I need to -- you know, I did really poorly the back nine, so I get a little bit more momentum going on the greens.  Generally lost momentum after a quick birdie on 9 at the turn, and then, yeah, just hit a little bit closer, get a bit of positive feedback on the greens, which I had all day yesterday and in the front nine, and then should be fine, yeah.
