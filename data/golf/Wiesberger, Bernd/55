Q. Your thoughts on shooting a nice 66 to move right up there?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, that's a good score today.  It's quite windy out there.  Obviously tougher than yesterday.  I played decent.  I had a couple bad breaks, a couple good breaks.  Still felt like I left a lot of shots out there on the greens, even though I hit good putts.  But it's tough to read some of them.  All in all I played really, really steady golf today.  I would have liked to maybe get into double digits, but the score in these conditions today, quite happy with that.
Q. Does the wind actually help on occasion, as well?
BERND WIESBERGER: Well, if you play every hole downwind and you have the pin at the back, it helps.  But obviously it's all around, and sometimes it's tough to get the wind, as well, when you maybe get underneath the top of the branches to know 100 per cent where the wind is coming from and a couple elevated tee shots, as well.  Definitely it's a bit more challenge than yesterday.
Q. Are you feeling better as the week goes on about things?  Obviously it's an improved score; you've done a lot of traveling.
BERND WIESBERGER: To be honest, I was a bit not having too much expectations going into this week.  I lost my swing a little bit last week and struggled early on this week.  So not too many expectations.  I played nicely yesterday.  Played nicely today.  Only had one bogey so far, which is good, and something to build on.  Hopefully I can continue on the weekend where I left off today.
Q. Given your position, do your expectations change?
BERND WIESBERGER: No, I'm driving the ball pretty nicely, so if I keep doing that -- I enjoy playing this golf course.  Maybe have a bit of work on the short to mid-range putts today to get a bit more line aware out there and get a better feel for the read of the greens.  Otherwise, just enjoy.
