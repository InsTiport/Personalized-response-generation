 Q.  Talk about this lovely round first.  What are your thoughts on shooting a 66 to move nicely into the mix?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, obviously a good day today out there.  It was quite hot again, so a bit struggling with staying hydrated and keeping the focus up.  But I made a couple more putts than I usually do, and reduced the mistakes to a minimum and sometimes could even bounce back with a birdie after being out of position.  No, it was a very good day and thankfully finished it with a nice birdie.   
 Q.  Was it different or easier playing first thing in the morning when the winds haven't yet picked up?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Doesn't look like it's getting too windy today.  It was pretty calm through out the day.  A little breeze every now and then made it a bit more, how do you say, more comfortable with the heat but the wind was not really an effect today.   
 Q.  Clearly things can change but what do you think of your position on the board and your opportunities into the weekend?  
BERND WIESBERGER: We'll see.  I think today is a good scoring day.  It looks tomorrow will be quite a breeze and I tough day.  Yeah, nice round today, let's feed off it for the weekend.   
 Q.  Is there an added determination to get something out of the season-ending tournament?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, a lot to play for this week.  I'm looking forward to the final events of the season and try my best to get good results in, and obviously a lot to play for for the World Rankings.
