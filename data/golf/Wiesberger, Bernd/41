BERND WIESBERGER: Wasn't quite as good yesterday where I hit it closer, but I made a couple birdies, left a couple out there.  Never really in any danger of making bogeys at some point.  Scrambled all right.  I just missed a couple of greens but all in all, a solid day's work.  It could have been, again, a couple shots better.   
 Q.  Seemed like benign conditions, a fair bit of warmth until now.  Tricky pins?  
BERND WIESBERGER: No, it kind of feels like it's right there.  It really feels like they gave it to us so far.  Pins were in really very gettable positions for the first three days and I'm surprised the scoring is not lower than what it is.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on Sunday in this position?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I mean, obviously liking it.  Let's see how many shots we are going to trail by the end of the day, but we are positioned and hopefully we can make a good, quick start like we did today and just keep pushing forward.  Everything to play for.
