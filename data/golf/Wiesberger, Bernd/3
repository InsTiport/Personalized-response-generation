  Q. Bogey-free 64 to start your tournament here in Saudi.  How pleased are you with your score this morning?
 BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah good.  Obviously it was flat calm pretty much all day.  So I had to attack.  I played pretty well.  First nine I had almost a look at birdie every hole.  Played really steady.  Got away with the odd thing on the back nine, but kept it together.  Got a score in and really pleased with the start for sure,
 Q. Would you agree, pretty solid start to the season, some good signs last week in Dubai.  Is that a continuation?
 BERND WIESBERGER:   Absolutely.  I played -- I just played myself into the weekend in Dubai, both actually in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  Played steady over the first two weeks.  I actually played really well on the weekend in Dubai.  Just couldn't get anything on the greens, as most of the guys probably did.
 But yeah, stayed positive.  I didn't really put a lot of hours in so far this week, so I was quite rested this morning.  I knew I was playing well, so just kind of tick over and did that well today.
