Q.   Your thoughts on today?
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, it was a tough day for me today.   I couldn't hole any putts really.   Played okay but I hit bad putts, didn't hit my lines, didn't read them well.   Couldn't take my chances then.   My play actually tee‑to‑green was pretty good.   Yeah, if it's my off‑day, I'll probably take it.

Q.   Sounds irritating and frustrating but in terms of score, it's not bad at all?
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, I would have probably said 66, 67 was definitely out there for me, but I missed a stupid two‑footer on the third and a couple short ones at the end of the back nine and at the front nine.   Yeah, that's how it is, and some work done on the putting green, get some momentum back there and get the goods out of the long game. 

Q.   Just the nature of golf, not something that you're doing wrong particularly. 
BERND WIESBERGER:   No, just today was not the best day on the greens for me, so I kept plugging away, kept hitting decent shots and that was good.   Left myself a couple chances and yesterday I took them really nicely and just didn't do quite as good.   But tomorrow is another day and feeling good with my game.
