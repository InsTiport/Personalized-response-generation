  BERND WIESBERGER:   Put down the pins this morning and thought there was a good chance we would score.   The wind came up and the greens are really, really hard to stop it on.   It was tough, yeah.   I didn't play particularly well.   Didn't put good.   But I somehow scrambled around, a couple under for par, especially the one on the first was good.   There's momentum there.   
Yeah, it was tough work today.   It was tough work.  
   
 Q.   You've hung in there and that birdie at the last means that you've got a nice opportunity for a good finish.   
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, it was nice to finish with birdie obviously.   But yeah it was a tough working day, and took advantage of the par 5s, which was nice, birdied all of them.   But a couple silly mistakes, and, yeah, I need a bit of work on the putting green later to get a bit more comfortable on those lag putts and around the green.   
   
 Q.   Not feeling 100 per cent right at the moment?   
BERND WIESBERGER:   I felt a bit dizzy walking up that last hole.   It was a long day, very hot, and maybe just didn't drink quite enough.   
   
 Q.   Fancy your chances on the final day, at least a good finish?   You probably know who is leading.   
BERND WIESBERGER:   I didn't look too much on the leaderboard but a couple back obviously against the world No. 1.   But I'll try to get back to where I played on Thursday and make a good move early on and you never know.
