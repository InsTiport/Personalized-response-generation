Q. Tell us about a good day.
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, I didn t know how I would feel after three weeks off   I really enjoyed the break, but I thought it might take me a while to get my feel and my swing back to where it was. But I got off to a pretty fast start and that got me back into my rhythm again fairly quickly. I played really solid golf for the first eight holes, but then unfortunately bogeyed the ninth, which was my first dropped shot in 67 holes of tournament golf. It was a good run, but I suppose it had to come to an end some time. The back nine was much more of the same   I felt in control of the ball and it was a similar feel to my final round in Korea. And to finish with a birdie was obviously a great way to end the day.

Q. There have been a few changes to the course, including the 18th is it set up to attack a lot more?
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, especially as the 18th tee was brought forward today. I was in two minds whether to hit a driver or three wood, but in the end I went with a driver and left myself with a nice six iron for my second shot. I hit my approach to six metres, but unfortunately couldn t make the eagle putt. Still, a 68 in my first round back is not a bad start.

Q. How has the reaction been to your win back home?
BERND WIESBERGER:   It s been absolutely great. It s obviously not every week that Austria has a European Tour winner, so I obviously had lots of media to do, which was a lot of fun. Hopefully it will raise the profile of golf in Austria, and get some more young children to take up the game. I had always planned to take two weeks off before Wentworth, but I also decided to skip Seville after Korea because I knew there would be lots of interest back home. And at the moment it s looking like a good decision, because I feel good and ready to go again. My confidence has obviously gone up a level or two after winning, and hopefully I can keep it going for the rest of the season now.
