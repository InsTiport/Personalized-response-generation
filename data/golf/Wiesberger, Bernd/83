  BERND WIESBERGER:   Obviously happy, I got myself back into contention again and up the leaderboard, so very happy to see that, after a couple of hiccups, as well, during the round.   No, all in all, I like the way I hit the ball.   I like the way I executed my chances when I had them, so pleased with my game overall.  
   
 Q.   You were not entirely happy, because of the hiccups on the first day, but doesn't matter, if the hiccups keep producing this kind of score in the end?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   I prefer to not make bogeys with wedges in hands, and 3â€‘putting is something that you should avoid.   I've had three of those today, but as well, I made a lot of good things, a lot of good putts, which cancel it out and got myself up the leaderboard, so all in all, a good day.  
   
 Q.   Not only up the leaderboard, but right at the top as things stand.   Is it going to stay come the end of the day?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, got a couple of guys who really played well yesterday in the morning, and the conditions are still very good.   So I don't expect to be in the lead at the end of the day, but you know, there and about, and that's where you want to be on Sunday.  
   
 Q.   Very positive into the weekend?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   Definitely, playing nicely, quite in control, and I've holed a couple of long putts, but if I keep that momentum over the weekend, I'll be up there.
