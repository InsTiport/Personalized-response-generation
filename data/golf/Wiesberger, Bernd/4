Q. Give us a sense of the emotions you've been through the last sort of 24, 48 hours and your reaction to the statement and news that has been dramaticized over the last sort of few hours?
BERND WIESBERGER: Well, first of all, I want to say I think it's the right move, what Jay Monahan and the PGA TOUR have done going forward. Obviously everyone here would have loved to see some golf, but in the bigger picture I'm in constant contact with family and relatives in Europe, and it's pretty bad there. I'm looking forward to going back home and being with them and help out over there, so in the bigger picture just having a golf tournament here and that's it.
But you know, it's unprecedented times. We all need to kind of stick together and do the right thing for everyone, for the elderly, to not have anyone affected that doesn't need to be, and therefore I think it's good we're packing up today and kind of going home and try to -- as I said yesterday, have as minimal a social contact as possible and try not to spread it any further.
Q. Give us a sense of the timing. Obviously at one point yesterday it was only fans, and then it was about 10:00 when you were all advised, wasn't it?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I was asleep actually. It was a tiring day yesterday. A lot went on. With the time change I was up really early seeing things unfold at home. I mean, I'm getting videos from supermarkets being completely robbed basically from people panicking at home, and it's not nice news you want to wake up to, and to some degree you can feel this coming over here, as well, it's inevitable. Europe has been hit, Asia has been hit, and hopefully over here in the States it can buffer it up better than we've done in Europe, but inevitably it's going to be here, as well. It's crazy news, it's been a long day. I found out by my caddie calling me actually on my hotel phone because I've had my stuff on silent, and the first thing was trying to get home as soon as possible. The only logical thing to do, and trying to help out at home and help any elderly, my grandmother, my parents with any sort of grocery shopping so they don't have to go out too much and just trying to get through this on our own or all together, but it's crazy times. I certainly haven't experienced anything -- I'm sure most of us probably haven't experienced anything like that. I'm sure tough times, stick together, do the right things, stay healthy and just lay low for a while. But golf will return at some point, we don't know when, but it's not a priority right now.
Q. What are your travel plans right now? When do you hope to get back?
BERND WIESBERGER: Well, funny enough, I'm on the last flight back to Europe. The last Austrian Airlines flight back to Vienna departed this morning, it's on the way, and the last is going back this afternoon. I'd like to be on that one. I'm pretty sure more travel bans are going to happen for Europe, and it's going to be a bit crazy, so I'm actually quite fortunate to be able to go back, but it also means that I won't be able to come back for the Masters if that's going to happen. I doubt it, but we'll see. But you know, decisions have to be made, and I think it's the only right one.
