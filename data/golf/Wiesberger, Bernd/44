 Q.  Let's talk about the early part of the round, 5-under par through eight holes.  What were you doing particularly well at that stage?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Kind of everything.  I drove it right.  I just had one hiccup off the 12th tee, which is our third hole, where they moved the tee box and didn't quite commit to it.  Other than that, it was quite good to control and I hit lovely shots to set up kind of easy birdies.   
You know, then just 18th tee, just hit a wayward drive.  Two bad decisions after that, and paid the price with a triple-bogey there.  Those things can happen.  Tried to re-settle and played decent, and obviously the way I finished was quite disappointing.   
 Q.  Obviously this is a golf course which really tests every aspect of the game.  Is it just evidence of the fact that you don't have to do much wrong here to suddenly have a big number and succession of bogeys?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Definitely, it goes quick.  I could see that.  I was in control; I felt like I had it figured out, and it just bites you back and shows you who is the boss out here.   
I need to stay shot for shot, and even though I played lovely early on, I didn't quite do it and gave it back just as quickly.  Need to reset this afternoon and need to work on a couple of things and go out and do the same things I did early on today.
