 Q.  Thoughts on the final day?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Well, glad we managed to play this week, after all was said and done by the promoter and everybody involved with the Turkish Airlines Open, I think everybody had a great week and so did we.   
I played nicely.  Got myself somewhat back into the mix around the turn.  But you know, all in all, it was a good week.  I'm happy with my performance and made a good move in The Race to Dubai, so all in all, it's a good week.   
 Q.  I sense you don't feel it's a great week for you personally but there were so many good things and the way you caught fire for a little while again today, that was nice.  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, that was good.  I only made four bogeys all week again, similar like I did at The Grove a couple weeks ago and that's a really positive for me, not getting into trouble too much.  When I did, I got a way a little bit today with some wayward shots, but keeping the bogeys off the card, that's a lot of positives to take into my final event in Dubai.   
 Q.  There's a lot to look forward to for the season ender, isn't there?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I've got a week off next week and then obviously our final, the DP World in Dubai, and I've got the World Cup coming up in Australia, as well, that I'm looking forward to and that should be a fun week.   
I hope I can keep the momentum going throughout next week and into Dubai.  Should be a good season ending.
