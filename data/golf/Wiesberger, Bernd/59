  BERND WIESBERGER:   It's been a great first half of the year for me so far.   I've had a lot of great success but just couldn't pull it quite off.   To stand here with the trophy right now, it's pretty sweet. 
Another tradition of this great tournament, and I'm very proud to be now on this trophy. 

Q.   The front nine, what were you thinking‑‑
BERND WIESBERGER:   Well, I just hit a great shot down the fourth before the horns were blowing and they took us off the course.   I liked my yardage and had a good shot in there and had some momentum building, chipped in, held a long putt. 
I felt really comfortable out there.   Had a great weekend, only one bogey, 66,65, that's not a bad score. 

Q.   Three behind at the start of the day, and the front nine in 31.   What's the mind‑set then, very dangerous holes to come? 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Well, pretty much what I did, I hit still great golf shots.   Stayed aggressive but not stupidly, and I gave myself a lot of chances.   It was a bit frustrating because I didn't make any but I stayed calm and putted well on the dangerous holes, 15, 16, and obviously the save on 17 was huge mentally.   Very pleased to pull that off. 

Q.   We saw last year that you have the game to contend into major; how excited to be heading into The Open Championship holding this trophy and in this sort of form? 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Oh, I love St. Andrews.   I love the Open.   I love playing hard golf courses.   As you can see, I played well in Ireland and now on this one.   I'm really much looking forward to the rest of the major season.
