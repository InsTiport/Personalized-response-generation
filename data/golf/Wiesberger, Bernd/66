 Q.   Well played.   
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, Sergio was in control on the front nine, hit it nice except for that one hole which I managed to get.   I didn't play well and tried to resettle on the 10th tee, hit a couple of good shots then.   Got back to even.   
A good break on 15, where I chipped in and a great shot into 16, which got me 2â€‘up.   And I fought back nicely, obviously was able to win.  
   
 Q.   First time here at TPC Harding Park.   What are your thoughts about it?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   I like it.   It's not a very long course.   It's a shot makers course.   I need to improve my shot making to a point where I can be competitive here.   It's fun to play.   It holds up very well.   Enjoying my time here.
