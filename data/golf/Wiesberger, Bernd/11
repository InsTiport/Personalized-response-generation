 Q.  Another round of 69. What's been the secret to the success so far?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, last week, we fell into some bad mental habits. Got a bit frustrated. Coming here, I knew it was a golf course that can really bite you and test you mentally, and even though early on I wasn't on it, I had to stay calm and take the chances when I got them. After the 5th hole, I played pretty decent golf and took my chances. Just trying to stay a little bit calmer and wait for good things to happen.   
Luckily I turned two bad starts into pretty decent rounds.   
 Q.  Talk about the mental frustration. You're No. 1 in The Race to Dubai, and you're excited about that challenge, and is there also a sense of expectation about what you could achieve?  
BERND WIESBERGER: It's not in the forefront. I'm very aware of what's ahead and the chance I've got this next week. At the end of the day, it's six months of golf which I put 100 per cent in, and if I do it every day regardless of the outcome, I'll be proud, proud of the season, proud of everyone who supported me this year. That's all we can do.   
Obviously we try to go as well prepared into every round, every tournament going forward. Looking forward to what's ahead in the next couple of days.
