 Q.  Tough conditions out there.  How was it for you?  
BERND WIESBERGER: It was fine today.  We had all this the same yesterday, so it was probably one of the toughest two rounds in a row, especially out here in the Middle East.  I've never seen conditions like this.   
A little bit unlucky in the draw and thought it was better conditions yesterday morning, but that's how it is.  Did well also, just a hiccup on the last and played well again today.  Not making my chances; could have been a couple better.  I've just got to battle away in the tough conditions.
