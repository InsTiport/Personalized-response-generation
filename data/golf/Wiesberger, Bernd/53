BERND WIESBERGER: Something new, first time for me here at the EurAsia Cup.  Everybody is having fun.  I think everybody is enjoying each other's company and that's most important at an event like this.  To start off the year, a Ryder Cup year, with a team event, we get into the feeling what it should be at The Ryder Cup later on in the year, as well.  It will be a good experience and also a nice, smooth way to start a new season.   
 Q.  That suggests Ryder Cup is very much in your mind for the year ahead?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Well, you know, when you step off the golf course, it's a goal you want to achieve, but not too much on the golf course.  Even not so much during this week.  First of all, we want to perform well and win and make a good impression on the EurAsia Cup team captain who also happens to be The Ryder Cup Team captain.  It's a good week to make an impression but not a good week to maybe have other things on your mind, rather winning each match.   
 Q.  You're so used to preparing as an individual for tournaments.  How is it being part of this environment?  
BERND WIESBERGER: It's nice.  You can learn off each other.  You can get a feeling how the guys are approaching different situations and try to work as a team.  It's always nice to get that aspect of the game in every now and then because most of the time, we play for ourselves and against the course.  It's good to have that kind of team battle going, as well.
