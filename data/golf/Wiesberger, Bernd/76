 Q.   Great round.   Great finish.   
BERND WIESBERGER:   I'm very pleased obviously.   I didn't expect any of this really coming into this week.   I knew I was prepared well and the course really suits my eye.   So far I'm taken advantage of this and it's great to finish the round with three birdies in a row and basically tap‑in birdies as well.   
That gives me hopefully good momentum going into tomorrow and really it's a new situation for me in a major championship.  
   
 Q.   Do you have extra energy playing with Phil Mickelson?   
BERND WIESBERGER:   Well, I knew what I was going to expect going to today and everybody is pulling for Phil.   He played nicely down the stretch as well, which got the crowds fired up a little bit and was good.   
You know, maybe I stayed a bit in the background and let him do his thing.   The crowd cheered for him.   It was nice being in the situation.   He's a great player, to feed off his performance as well for sure.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   Well, you know, I have it in me.   I know I can perform on the big stage.   I haven't‑‑ I have been a bit disappointed with the way I've played maybe this year at the U.S. Open, at the British where I thought my game was in a good spot but I couldn't pull it off.   
I've kind of decided to get a bit of different preparation into this week, two weeks after after the British, came here early, had a good look at the course, felt really rested on Thursday morning.   I tried to enjoy.   I think at the majors before‑‑ it is obviously hard to play those events, but you shouldn't forget to have fun and really had fun out there this weekend.
