 Q.  61 yesterday, 65 today.  It's often difficult to follow up a super low round with another good one.  What was the secret to you doing so today?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I just stayed with it.  Early on I actually, as I told you, I was hitting the ball good.  I was just making minor misses and couldn't capitalise.  And then once we got a bit of break off the tee shot on 5 and made birdie there, it kind of kick started it a little bit and definitely towards the turn, we played really good and holed a few putts.   
Yeah, then after the turn, it kind of stalled for us a little bit.  We weren't getting any more birdies, a couple of loose swings.  Yeah, just happy to get a couple birdies in late in the round to get a mid-60s.  I'm pleased with the way I handled myself today and the way I finished off.   
 Q.  You mentioned the run you had, four birdies in five holes from the 5th.  What's going through your mind as that happening and building a lead three shots by the turn?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, just keep doing what we're doing.  I was really comfortable off the tee with driver, which had nice a reset yesterday on the range.  I really felt I drove it nicely out there today.  Hit a lot of fairways and just could build off that.  Other than that, I just tried to stick with it, what we were doing, and not get ahead of myself.  You know, it's still a lot of golf to be played.   
 Q.  A recent win in Denmark, second place last week.  How valuable to have had such recent experience of being under the gun?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I'm quite flat with my heart rate I feel.  I'm just enjoying being out there and not looking ahead too far.  Playing with Nino out there today, he had a great start and I just tried to plug away and match him to a degree.  I just caught a bit of fire before the turn.   
But definitely, being in the position the last few weeks or been there in the round does help, but it's always a bit nerve-wracking and a bit of a different situation.
