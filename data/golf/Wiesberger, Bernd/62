 Q.   What are your thoughts on a tough day out there?   
BERND WIESBERGER:     Hope it's not over yet in a way.   It was very tough.   I struggled a little bit with my irons into the wind coming back on the outward nine and left a lot of shots out there which I really shouldn't have done.   
And yeah, a couple of birdies after the turn helped to get back in the mix, and you know, I would have loved to finish with a birdie there.   I hit two great golf shots on 17 and 18.   The wind just left it completely long and just ended up a bit too far‑‑ I recovered from the front nine.   
   
 Q.   How do these conditions compare to some you've faced?   
BERND WIESBERGER:     Pretty much up there.   When I heard yesterday that we are going to have high winds, I tried to, again, it's a hard course but with those conditions, even more so and I need to stay patient.   
Around the turn, luckily had a good break on 12 with the drive and let me come back a little bit.   I felt pretty decent from then inwards.   But it's probably up there with the toughest conditions you can get on a great links course.   
   
 Q.   And comfortable with your finishing position?   
BERND WIESBERGER:     You know, I don't wish anyone making bogeys.   I've had my chance to go 3‑under.   If I get another opportunity to play for the wind, obviously I would love to take it but we'll see how it goes.
