 Q. Round of 68, what was the secret to success? 
 BERND WIESBERGER: Well, kept my game together really. I had a good start with two birdies, and then two bogeys on 5 and 6. After that, I kept myself together and had a good last couple of holes. 

 Q. What was your minds set going out? 
 BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, just wanted to have a solid round. I saw the forecast, it wasn't as good, and I heard it's getting windy tomorrow. Yeah, just give myself a chance coming tomorrow.

 Q. Are you a good wind player? 
 BERND WIESBERGER: I've improved. I've been a bit shaky really but had a couple of really fun days and done well. So I look forward to a challenge at least.

 Q. Currently 105 in The Race to Dubai, so a cheque tomorrow will secure your playing rights for next year, or you're going for the win, what's the story?
 BERND WIESBERGER: Either way. Looking forward to tomorrow. Had a great final round in Ireland and want to try to get something together like I did three weeks ago in Ireland, and if I can do, that I would be happy. 
 I think it's going to start raining a little bit, but I got lucky yesterday, as well with an early morning draw and it was quite rainy in the afternoon. 

 Q. Nothing lucky about your back nine, particularly the last four holes. 
 BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, actually it was the last seven, I played them in 4-under, so it was pretty strong. I was happy with that. I had good putts on 15 and 17. Unfortunately I couldn't get up-and-down on 16 from the right. I was happy with the way I recovered. 

 Q. Saturday, moving day, you've certainly done that. You're in contention. Can you win this?
 BERND WIESBERGER: You never know. I've heard tomorrow is going to be a bit of rough wedge we are some high winds and guys are going to struggle, so if you can keep your score together tomorrow, who knows. I just go out and try to do the same things today. I've driving the ball pretty good, holing a couple of putts every now and then and if I can do it tomorrow, you never know.
