 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BERND WIESBERGER: No, not really.  I wasn't putting it in my head.  I don't think it was a great match where you saw a lot of birdies.  But we kind of avoided the mistakes, except for the odd one.  And I think at the end of the day he kind of lost interest and I maybe holed a few more putts at the right time compared to him that could have changed the momentum of the game.  I felt I was in control for the most part.  I'm happy to get a win on the first day.   
 Q.  It's tough getting around the first day, because it's all about momentum and confidence on this course.  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, it felt like I had momentum early.  And then he had momentum after getting three holes up on me on 5, 6, 7.  Then it switched my way again.   
It was a good game and definitely in match play more so you want to -- if you are on you want to keep momentum.  And if it switches the other way you want to get it back quickly.  Therefore I'm just happy that I ended up at the end of the day.   
 Q.  Thoughts about tomorrow, another match coming up fast and swiftly, isn't it?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I'm going to rest this afternoon.  And going over the full distance, 18 holes, on a breezy and warm day, it kind of tires you off.  So I'm going to get a good cool down session later on and get some rest for tomorrow.  It's going to be definitely a tough match against Alex tomorrow.
