 Q.   Is it exciting to start 2015 in this fashion?   
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, very good.   Definitely didn't expect scores like this just yet in the first tournament of the year.   But I've been playing all right.   I struggled a bit off the tee the first three days, but the rest of the game has been very solid.   Tried to avoid the bogey.   Taking some outside chances for birdie this week, so, yeah, quite pleased with where I'm standing right now.  
   
 Q.   Some of those outside chances are down to some terrific putts?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, sometimes you have to be careful on these pins.   I played a bit conservative on some of them, and got a good break on 12 and 14, some longer putts, which gave me a bit of momentum there and kept my round going.   
But yeah, I think if I feel comfortable on the greens, even those can drop every now and then.  
   
 Q.   And you are feeling in tune with things?  
BERND WIESBERGER:   I would love to hit some more fairways, but my iron shots and my wedge, especially, has been much better than pretty much all of last year.   I can take way more birdies coming in with wedges, so that's quite good, and putting, if that works well, which it did so far this week.   
   
 Q.   Did you reflect on last year and think, it's got to be better; you were not quite at the heights you reached before.   
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, I had lots of Topâ€‘20s last year, lots between 10th and 15th and just couldn't quite get myself up there in the hunt.   I'm going to try towards getting myself more and more in this position that I am now over the weekend.   
Obviously Martin is way ahead, but still, I'm getting myself into the last couple groups on Sunday and pushing myself towards playing better under these conditions, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
