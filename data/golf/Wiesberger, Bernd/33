 Q.  Give us your assessment on the final round, bearing in mind conditions were really tricky out there.  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, it was really windy already warming up, so we knew it was going to be a grinding day.  Pins were really, really tucked away today, as well.  You could bail out easily, leave yourself long putts; taking on the pins was really risky today.  I think I found a good balance with it.  Drove the ball just as good as I could really.  Really, really important to hit it well off the tee.   
Came into the greens, not quite there, but I left myself a bit too far for purchasing for more birdies.  But all in all, just two bogeys all week.  Really happy with that, first week out on a tough golf course.   
 Q.  Coming up two short, you must take a lot of positives from this week?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, like I said, keeping the mistakes off the card, this week it was good.  Definitely I felt some positive things in my game this week.  As I said all week, I'm not really sure where it's going to stand after the first couple of weeks but I'm really pleased with the way I've started 2017.   
 Q.  What does that do for the next two events in the desert where you've performed well before?  
BERND WIESBERGER: I feel good.  I'm looking forward to Qatar next week, and then Dubai.  As you said, I've played well in the past there, as well, in the last three years.  I come in off good form.  I've done some good things over the break.  It's definitely something I'm looking forward to, and going out next week again and trying from scratch.
