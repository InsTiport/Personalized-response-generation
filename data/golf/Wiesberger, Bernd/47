 Q.  Given the circumstances of the weather this morning, how satisfied are you with a round like that?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, you know, wasn't easy, especially the front nine where I actually played better.  But anything under par I think today is all right.  I thought the score, I thought it would go towards 4-, 5-, 6-under maybe, even though it was windy and a bit of rain.  But the greens are good in the morning.  I'm happy with the score in relation to the field.  So yeah, a good first day for me.   
 Q.  Happy, therefore, with your attitude, because that is often key when you're playing in awkward weather conditions.  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, you know, for me in these weather conditions, it's key to get it in play.  I've been struggling off the key, and the guys from Titleist really found me a good setup for this week.  I put in a new shaft in my driver and really feel committed over that and I can play better knowing the wind.  That helps.   
Even though I made a couple stupid mistakes around the turn, but getting out there, it's not easy.  You see everybody struggling with the conditions.  Just stick with it and had a bit of a rough patch through the turn, but luckily made a longer putt on to get myself in red figures which I felt I should have been all day.
