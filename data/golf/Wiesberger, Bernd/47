Q. Pretty good in these conditions?
BERND WIESBERGER: Well, I don't think I could have played one single stroke better than that.  I played actually off the tee pretty bad.  I was in trouble a lot, out of position.  Just kept it together and at the end, hit one good wedge into 15, hit a good 3-wood into 16 and made two birdies and somehow shot under par.  But need to work a bit on my driving for tomorrow.  It needs to get better, a bit more into play and not get into positions I don't want to be in tomorrow.
Obviously given the conditions, it was a decent score.
Q. I know there's plenty of players still out there, but if you look at that board, you're in a fine position, aren't you?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I thought starting the day, if you get 70, something in the 60s even, if you can do that, you would be good.  It's not a day where the leaders are going to run away.  It's going to be bunched up.  It's just a matter of staying in it and not making too many mistakes and getting too many bogeys on the card and fortunately, that's what I did.  A lot of scrambling.  So yeah, looking forward to tomorrow.
