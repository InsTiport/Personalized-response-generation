 Q.  A couple under par yesterday. You said you battled and you enjoyed how you managed to perform. What about today's performance, 17 pars and one birdie, what did you make of it?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, got to say, Matt and I were pretty flat out there today. Couldn't get any momentum, either of us, unfortunately. You know, I was out of position a couple of times and I did well then and hung in there and saved my pars.   
Early on I had a couple good looks and I would loved to have get the round going, and didn't quite happen. On the positive side, when we were out of position, we did well to stretch out a couple of pars, but obviously would have loved to make more of a move.   
But you know, still two rounds ahead of us. Work a little bit this afternoon and see to turn it around a little bit for tomorrow.   
 Q.  You know the world's media, what they are talking about, the enormity of this week and the sort of things you are up for grabs. Give us an idea, what does it feel like? Does it feel like you thought it would coming into this tournament in the position that you are?  
BERND WIESBERGER: I played so well in the big tournaments when I was in position, that I feel quite comfortable regardless what's thrown at me. We have so many good players out here all capable of being in my position. Just cherish being the one who has tried to be hunted down. Try to do the best we can and enjoy it as much as we can.   
As I've said, you don't know how many times you get in a position, and when you are, it's a great feeling. So hopefully we get to finish the season stronger with another couple of good rounds and we'll see what happens then.   
 Q.  Are you a leaderboard watcher? Do you monitor where the other guys are around you?  
BERND WIESBERGER: There's a couple more leaderboards out there than normally, but more for getting a guidance how the course really plays. I thought I had a couple more chances in relation to par to get a couple more under par, but it looks like it's only the odd few who made birdies out there and really made a move.   
It's more for not getting too frustrated with not being more under par because kind of the whole field is not running away.
