Q. 67, 4-under. What really changed on the back nine?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I wasn't swinging well early on. I missed a couple of shots and didn't get up-and-down early on and dropped behind.
You know, just tried plugging away. Keep grinding. Keep making pars when I was out of position. I did that well, and hit a good pitch into 9, and holed a lovely putt off the green for par on 10, and that kind of started a bit of momentum, and then rolled in a few nice ones. Took advantage nicely of the par 5s today.
Q. What did that run feel like on the back nine?
BERND WIESBERGER: It was good. It was good. We tried to keep it going. Obviously had a pretty good feeling for the green at that point, and was hitting the putts online. They are rolling beautiful, so if you hit it on line, you have a good chance on making some. It was pleasant on the back nine.
Q. A couple wins already, big win at the Scottish, a Rolex Series Event, how nice to be in the mix once again in one of the premiere events on The European Tour.
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, these weeks are very important for our season-ending, Race to Dubai. We try to focus on those and make the best out of these weeks. I feel I've played well in bigger events. Played good in Wentworth and in Scotland. Yeah, tried to keep that Rolex Series momentum going.
Q. Give us your assessment of how things went?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I started hitting the ball a little bit better from 6, 7, onwards. Before that, I was a little off and wasn't able to grind out some pars. Not happy with the start obviously, but just trying to dive through it.
Looking for the momentum to shift a little bit, and definitely did on 9 when I hit a pitch and made a birdie and rolled a putt in for par on the next. Made a few nice putts on the back nine, and always good to finish strong in the back nine on a Saturday to get in position.
Q. Did you feel you had to grind through those first nine holes for things to change?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, at least I was driving it really well. I was getting it in position, but then I was struggling a little bit into the greens, which is kind of uncharacteristic. Get those days every now and then. Just plugging away. Tried to stay within myself and I did that pretty well, and then on the back nine, I had a couple good looks at it and fortunately made a few of them.
Q. You won in Scotland, the Rolex Series Event there. What confidence will you draw from that going into tomorrow?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, we are out here to play for the big events, and obviously these select few are very important for our Race to Dubai at the end of the year, and try to be as well prepared as possible.
So far, we are doing all right. There's still a little more in the tank, especially hitting towards those flags when I get myself into position off the tee. I should be a little bit more decisive. But at the end of the day, we've done well this week. Plugging away when you're out of position and then getting those putts when we are, so quite happy with the position.
