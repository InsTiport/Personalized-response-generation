Q.   Thoughts on your finish?
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, at the end of the day, I have to be happy, had a tough time finding my concentration and making putts.   Big thanks to my caddie who got me around and executed some great shots at the end.   To finish at 68, good finish. 
Hit a perfect drive, online, hit an aggressive putt on a good line‑‑ went for it.   Can't blame myself, four out of the last five, pretty good finish to the tournament. 

Q.   It should bode well for tournaments to come?
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, a strong field this week and that's what counts, and having a good break again next week again and then the Majors and looking forward to the next tournament.
