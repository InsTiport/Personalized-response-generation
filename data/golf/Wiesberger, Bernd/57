 Q.  What are your thoughts on a different kind of day?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, it was challenging with the course was set up a lot shorter than previous days, and I thought I played okay, but just made some stupid mistake.  I should have shot a couple under par.  Putter was pretty average.   
Yeah, I went out there with the mind-set of a battling day today and I've done well for the most part.  But just things like that finishing off pushing it into the water, can't do that.   
 Q.  Despite the annoyance, do you take some positives about your position still in the tournament?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I played the last couple of holes as it would be the last of the tournament, and we'll see what the weather does.  It's not hit yet.  Obviously doing the same kind of weird shotgun thing, whatever that is, tomorrow again to get 72 in, but see what the afternoon is going to bring.
