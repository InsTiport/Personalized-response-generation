Q. You put yourself in good position.  Obviously Justin is out there playing some other kind of game.  You like the way you played today?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, even though I had a slow start early on and missed a couple of shots, but stayed calm.  Started hitting good shots from 8 onwards, I hit a couple of really nice shots, and gave myself a couple of good chances and mostly I'm quite happy with taking 4-under on the back nine to get into the 60s.
Q. To be in contention, this is the first time you've done it, you made it into the weekend.  You're not just here, you're contending.
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, it was big for goal for me to finally break that -- to slay the demon in a way.  My fourth U.S. Open and finally made it to the weekend.
So played decent the last couple of months.  I thought I was in good form coming here, even though I had a bit of a disappointing weekend last week in Austria.  But doing good things, and trying to keep up for another good one tomorrow.
