 Q.  Bogey-free 68 today.  Would you was that for you?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, it was tough today.  It was wind from the start and obviously increased a little bit throughout the round.  It was a little gusty at the end, so made it tough to hit greens.  As you saw, I struggled a little bit on the last couple holes.   
But I kept it together, kept the bogeys off the card which was nice and made some birdies early on.  I had a few more chances to go a few deeper which would have been obviously nice but a good round on a tricky day.   
Wind direction is similar or almost the same but it's obviously a couple miles an hour more in general with the gusts.  I would say it gusted up to 25, 30 miles an hour at some points there.  It makes it difficult on any course, especially if you have a couple of trees there where it swirls around a little bit.  It's still a good test.  Just kept it together and kept the bogeys off the card, and that's what counts.   
 Q.  Two shots behind.  Still in a great position.  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, let's see how the day finishes for us.  A lot more golf to be played for the guys in the afternoon but if it stays that way, it's going to stay breezy, and the greens are getting a little bit worse in the afternoons, as we know.   
It's going to be tricky out there for the guys in the afternoons.  We'll see where we are, but regardless, proud of the way we played today.  Good round for us today and look forward to hopefully a better weekend for us.
