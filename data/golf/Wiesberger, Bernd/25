 Q.  Today's 68, what was the difference today or was it more the same?  
BERND WIESBERGER: A bit disappointed to be honest, but I can see some improvement.  It was similar.  I just holed the odd putt more yesterday maybe.   
Today, pretty sloppy the last couple holes.  Unfortunately missed a couple greens there.  It was good but all in all, I'm there and about.  I'm looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  Scoring seems pretty decent this morning.  Is this almost perfect conditions?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, you couldn't get it any easier.  Greens are still receptive.  Not too much too in the rough this morning in case you missed them but all in all, I don't think you get it any easier than we did this morning.   
 Q.  9-under par total, how do you feel about your performance?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, very positive on the birdie count.  Unfortunately I threw in a couple bogeys, as well, a couple loose ones.  Played a bit sloppy in the last two holes.  Missed three of the four last greens, so wasn't pleased with that.  But first tournament out there, see where we are and so far we're on the leaderboard which is nice.   
 Q.  How much do you use last week and how much does that whet your appetite for this season, bearing in mind it's a Ryder Cup year?  
BERND WIESBERGER: I didn't play well the first two days.  I gave Rafa and Ross a lot of work to do unfortunately, but the Sunday was kind of a turning point for me.  I played really well.  I had a great score out there and a good game with Phachara, and that kind of felt like it sparked me a little bit.  I've played really well since, felt in control.  Even though I feel I still have some things to improve on but it definitely was a great week.
