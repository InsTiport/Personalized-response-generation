Q. Many, many congratulations, your third win in '13 starts, two of them Rolex Series Events. Sum up your emotions for me.
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, it was amazing. It's been a great summer for me. I've had a lot of good golf and a lot of progress from coming back after last year. I'm just enjoying my time out there. As I said, enjoying getting back into these situations.
It was scruffy at times out there, but we did really hard all week to keep making one extra put and we did really well today and we stayed really composed and really enjoyed all of that today and the last couple of weeks.
Q. Going into a tie for the lead on 9 and went two ahead when Matthew Fitzpatrick made a 7; what were you thinking and feeling as the back nine was unfolding?
BERND WIESBERGER: The first time I saw the board was on 16, when I knocked my putt in there, and that felt quite good. I could see a little cushion there. We didn't expect that at all. I didn't look at the board. I just wanted to keep making shots.
I didn't follow the scoring at all whatsoever. I was playing decent and got away with a couple of wayward shots, which you need to get as well sometimes, but just stayed composed and try to get as low a number as possible.
Q. This victory takes you to the top of The Race to Dubai. How excited with the possibility of ending the year as Europe's No. 1 golfer?
BERND WIESBERGER: Amazing. To be honest. I've played really well in the right events, obviously, in Ireland and Scottish, and here this week, which obviously helps getting up in that Race to Dubai. Just really excited what's ahead of us in the last few events.
Q. A year ago, you were five months into a seven-month injury, 389th in the world, and you're now just outside the Top-20. How do you explain what's happened? You've come back and hit the ground running from May onwards.
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I've been really good putting myself in positions and staying there. The weeks where I was up there was really only weeks where I was in contention, played well and enjoyed my time on the golf course what I was there. That's the key factor for me, as I said many times.
I've won three times this year and it's been the same every time. I just really enjoy my time and being back out there, because I know how tough it was when I had to withdraw from these events last year. It's just really full enjoyment out there when I'm in position.
