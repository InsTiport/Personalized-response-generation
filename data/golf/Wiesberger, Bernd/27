BERND WIESBERGER: Probably the worst it could have been.  Finished with two 3-putts on the last two, so not a great feeling coming off the course right now.
Q. Going into next week, you've won in Paris, how do you feel going into that week?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, looking forward to another big event.  Played better today, that's positive, but kind of looking forward to get out of here now.
