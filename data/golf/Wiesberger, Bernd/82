  BERND WIESBERGER:   Kind of disappointed because I think I played my best golf today of all week.   
   
 Q.   You're usually pretty good at seeing the positive out of situations, aren't you?   
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, you know, I'm hitting the ball well, just a bad tee shot‑‑ but the rest was really good golf.   I'm hitting it close and holing putts when I need to, and on the par 5s when I get on in two‑‑ just couldn't get it going but then it was good on the last.  
   
 Q.   And probably good playing with Martin Kaymer?   
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, we had a great round.   Obviously expecting a lot of people out there and that's what we got.   It's always nice playing with him, him favorite, but got my share of support out there, as well.   
   
 Q.   You are obviously playing well, so what do you feel is needed and capable of on the final day?   
BERND WIESBERGER:   A lot of birdies.   I'm still only four back.   I've won from that much behind in Austria with that many players tucked in between, so got a week off next week, so try to make as few shots as possible.
