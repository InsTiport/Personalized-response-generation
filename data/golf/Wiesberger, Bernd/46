 Q.  What do you make much a score like that on day one here?  
BERND WIESBERGER: I'm happy with the score.  Definitely anything under par today, or any day here, I think is all right, even though we had really low scoring two years ago.  But the rough is thick, penal, and some of the pins were, well, tucked away, at best, and therefore, it wasn't easy.   
I didn't play pretty with my irons, definitely not, but I got the ball in play off the tee, which was key.  You know, took advantage of the par 5s most of the day, and a couple of good, longer putts.  All in all, I'm happy with the score.  The way I played golf, I still can improve on my iron game, for sure.   
 Q.  One of the longer putts was at the last.  That was a nice way to finish, wasn't it?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I felt like I was kind of letting the round go, get away from me.  I started hitting a couple of wayward shots, starting on the par-3 4th, and it was a good way to kind of obviously finish off, but get a bit of that score back.  Nice way to finish.   
 Q.  How are energy levels?  
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I've played a lot of golf lately.  It's my sixth tournament in the last seven weeks, twice over the pond.  So I can feel that it's been a couple of long weeks.  But it's not an issue.  We've had a lovely day today.  It was a bit humid, but I'm going to have a bit of practise this afternoon and then a good rest before tomorrow afternoon and be ready to go.
