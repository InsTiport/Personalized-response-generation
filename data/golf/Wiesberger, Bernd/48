Q. 4-under par through here in blustery conditions?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, actually I'm pretty satisfied with my score.  The scoring looks a lot easier than it actually is out there.  We've got a good bit of wind out there.
But I played nicely.  Got in trouble a couple of times, mainly on distance control with my irons but managed to scramble well.  Holed a couple of 5-, 6-footers for par early on in the day, which kept the bogeys off the card.  Didn't have one all day, which was good.  Collected a couple on the back nine when I had chances, and yeah, overall I'm pretty happy with today's work.
Q. And are you conscious of getting off to a good start when the forecast is for a tricky week?
BERND WIESBERGER: Yeah, I like it.  I feel like I can calm down my swing and I feel like I can control the ball a lot better in these conditions.  And that's what I did today.  I wasn't particularly driving it well last week and early on this week, but that feeling about getting used to the wind and getting the ball into play kind of helps my swing it seems.  Hope it's not going to be too windy the rest of the week but so far, so good.
Q. Does that suggest that you found something in your driving on the range?
BERND WIESBERGER: As I said, just a bit of confidence, a couple of good swings on the range early on before we go out on the course, and just stick to it, trust what I'm doing, and you know, that's all you can do.  And today I drove it quite nicely.
Irons were pretty good in those conditions and I took chances on the greens, which are a bit slower, you have to get used to compared to last week.  It's not easy.  Overall it was definitely a good day for me.
