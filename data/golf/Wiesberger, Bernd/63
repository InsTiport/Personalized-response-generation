Q.   How do you stay warm competitively when it's like this? 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Yeah, it didn't quite snow or hail, like at the Match Play for Kaymer.   I thought it was a good idea and I keep it in my travel cover every week in case we get colder conditions.   I just didn't want to get too cold around my neck.   Felt like my ears, could lose the balance a little bit.   I know it's not pretty, but it keeps me a bit warmer.

Q.   Supposed to be even colder tomorrow, and you probably heard about the winds, 40 miles per hour.   You're in a good spot in this tournament.   Does that help you?
BERND WIESBERGER:   You know, it's pretty tight, just three shots behind, so that's a good position to be in.   We'll see what the weather does tomorrow.   I've heard about some more good winds out there for tomorrow, so it will play tough.   Just another round to grind it out probably. 

Q.   Talk about round three and the way it's panned out? 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Started nicely, played good on the front nine except for one shot out of the rough on 9, took a bogey there.   But yeah, in general on a day like this, anything under par I think was good.   A couple really low scores out there today, which was great golf I thought and generally I'm quite happy with 1‑under starting the day.

Q.   You still look cold.   I take it was tricky to cope with conditions even though they seem that much better than the first two days? 
BERND WIESBERGER:   Well, there was no sun, so it didn't really warm up.   Cold winds, I've heard that the winds from this direction we had today are actually the colder winds out year.   Yeah, it felt quite hold and I just tried to stay warm and managed somewhat to do so. 
Only three back.   Obviously SÃ¸ren had a great round out there today, and I was cruising along well on the front nine.   I thought if I could get another couple on the back it would be really good. 
But coming off a weird bogey after a really good shot into 14, a bit unfortunate there and again unfortunate on 16 where I tried to drive the green.   It was not ideal to pick up two bogeys there but it was a tough stretch coming in, and I'm just happy with a round under par today.

Q.   Do you have a sense of what's necessary on the final day? 
BERND WIESBERGER:   You know, I've heard about high winds tomorrow, anything could happen.   You could quite easily lose a couple of shots on each of those holes out there and you've got to be careful.   I don't think if it's really that windy that you're going to need a lot of birdies, but just keep the high numbers off the card and take every hole as a new challenge.
