  BERND WIESBERGER:   Well, he made a good birdie.   I was a bit stiff on the tee.   I just didn't want to take the left side into play, so hit it down the right a little.   I thought I hit a really good 3â€‘iron, it was right online.   I don't know how it came up that short.   It was like 15, 20 yards short from what I expected from that lie.   
Just two bad chips on 18 that kind of cost me in the end to go to another extra hole.   But all in all, especially after last week, the way I played there, I have to be very proud and I'm quite happy with second place, and especially going into my favorite event in a couple weeks, I hope I can go one better.
