 Q. How did your round two go for you today?
 JERRY TUCKER: I did a little better. I shot 76, but I'm going to miss the cut by four or so, so it's not what I hoped for. But I didn't embarrass myself totally.

 Q. Did you notice a difference between playing in the morning and the afternoon?
 JERRY TUCKER: Oh, yeah. Yeah. You always think you got the bad end of the deal, but I don't think there's much doubt about that. The wind picked up a lot yesterday afternoon, which it wasn't doing when we came in today. One of the guys with us was right on the cut line, Mike Harwood and if the wind would blow like it did for us yesterday he'll make the cut for sure. If it doesn't, he could miss it by one. But, yeah, a little bit of an advantage yesterday to go out early. 

 Q. Did the altitude affect you at all?
 JERRY TUCKER: We did pretty good with that. As far as picking the right yardages, if that's what you mean. Of course I'm 60 years old and not in too bad a shape, but just coming up 9 and 18 I was trudging a little bit, but it wasn't bad. I'm really glad I got to come out here and play.
