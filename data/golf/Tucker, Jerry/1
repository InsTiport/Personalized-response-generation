Q.   Just describe your round today. 
JERRY TUCKER:   Well, I played pretty good today.   73 in a Major is not bad for me.   Gave it a go.   I tried, I knew I was trying to finish par, birdie, birdie and I went par, birdie and hit a tree on the last hole. 
But yesterday was what got me.   Playing in the rain and all that in the afternoon we got the short end of the stick maybe.   But that's the way these go.   So it was tough to go low yesterday.   But overall I'm satisfied.

Q.   Well what was the differences between today's round and yesterday's?
JERRY TUCKER:   Well I had some more birdie chances today.   Yesterday when I did hit greens ‑‑ I hit 12 greens yesterday, which is not bad, but I kept leaving myself 50, 60 feet.   You're not going to make birdies that way.   I had quite a few chances today.   So I hit the ball a little better and putted a little bit better. 

Q.   Overall, how was the experience for you this week?
JERRY TUCKER:   First class.   Memorable.   One of the pinnacles of my career.   I played in a total of 17 Major, but this one, it ranks right at the top.
