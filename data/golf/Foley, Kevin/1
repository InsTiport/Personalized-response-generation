 Q.   All right.   Tell us about the hole-in-one on 12.   You saw John Merrick hit the same club right before you and go past the hole, I believe.   Did you have any second thoughts on your club?  
KEVIN FOLEY:   No.   We talked about it.   6 would have been pressing it a little bit too much and then you had the backstop there.   5 was right on the number.   
We said let's hit a little cut.   So I hit a little cut and it was falling a little right of the pin, landed just about pin high.   I wanted something coming in a little softer after seeing John's chase up the hill.   Even with the cut, it kind of ran to the top of the hill, stopped maybe for a second and then started to come back and it was taking the break pretty good right towards the hole.   It was tracking and at one point I think I said, "Go in."   Sure enough, we saw it disappear.   We went pretty crazy.  
   
 Q.   That was your first one on Tour.   Have you had any others professionally?  
KEVIN FOLEY:   Last year on the Web Tour in Salt Lake City.   I forget the name of that golf course.   I had one there.  
   
 Q.   The ball, what did you do with it?  
KEVIN FOLEY:   I looked to see if there was any little kids around.   There was a little girl, probably four, five years old.   I went up after we finished the hole and signed it and gave to it her.  
   
 Q.   Now, we don't know the name of the person but you did win mortgage payments through the Quicken Loans sweepstakes for somebody out there, lucky fan, mortgage payments for a year.   
What's your thoughts on that?  
KEVIN FOLEY:   I'm glad I could help somebody out.   You know, it was nice to grab a hole-in-one and to be able to have somebody lucky enough to win that.
