  GEORGE MURRAY:   I got off to a quick start and thought, oh, this is going to be nice.   Then don't really know about‑‑ looking back, if I repaired the pitchmark‑‑ I never repaired it properly.   I missed a really short putt.   I would admit it if it was a bad putt.   Bogeyed 16 out of nowhere and bogeyed 17 and then I was kind of hanging on for a couple of holes and finished quite strong which was good.   
   
 Q.   Carnoustie does that to you.   
GEORGE MURRAY:   You're never comfortable, you're always thinking, oh, no.   But I was happy to get in under par anyway.  
   
 Q.   Nice that this course is out of the way and you can go to Kingsbarns tomorrow?   
GEORGE MURRAY:   Still got to get it in the hole, that's the only thing.  
   
 Q.   How is everything feeling today?  
GEORGE MURRAY:   It was better today than yesterday.   My driving and that was a bit better.   I don't know if I was just more focused off the tee but definitely drove it better.
