 Q. Tell me about your round?
 GEORGE MURRAY: Played quite nicely. Had a chance on 10. Missed a couple of short ones great. Played great all week apart from that. Just made a couple of birdies coming in which was nice. 
 On the second, I holed a good 10-, 12-footer and saved par there and I birdied 3 and 4, so got a bit of momentum, and that's when the fog came in. 

 Q. Tough conditions out there, tougher than last few days?
 GEORGE MURRAY: I've been around this course more than any other course, used to caddie here, I know it like the back of my hand. 

 Q. How many years did you caddie here?
 GEORGE MURRAY: Since I was about 16 through about 23 or something like that. 

 Q. 67 isn't a bad round. 
 GEORGE MURRAY: It was almost a case of I was trying to overdo things, saw what I was used to seeing and I was double-checking it, so I was making it as simple as possible. 

 Q. Your season, obviously a bit of a struggle this year. 
 GEORGE MURRAY: It's been terrible. Tomorrow need a good finish, lost my card pretty much need to win it back. 
 Then I think we have got a few more after this, so I have maybe five events to try to get my card back. That would be nice. I've putted.

 Q. Where have you struggled? 
 GEORGE MURRAY: I've putted terrible most of the time. Most of the time it's been woeful but this week it's been bloody good. 

 Q. Has something just clicked?
 GEORGE MURRAY: I don't know what's happened. I don't feel any pressure to be honest. I'm dead relaxed. 

 Q. You'll be hoping that's the case tomorrow at St. Andrews? 
 GEORGE MURRAY: Not going too get too excited. Go home and have a good night's sleep hopefully.
