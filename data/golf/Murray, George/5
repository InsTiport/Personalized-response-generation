   GEORGE MURRAY: I always think I'm one of the people, if I give myself half a chance, and I'm able to take it. Like I think I'm a worse player when I'm not near the leaderboard. But when I get on the leaderboard, I think I'm a lot better when I'm there.   
  
  Q. Accompanying the world No. 1, as well.   
 GEORGE MURRAY: I must admit, when I stood on the first tee and they said world No. 1 Luke Donald, and he hit it obviously right in the middle and I thought, oh, no, that's me, four rounds just gone to gravy. But I managed to get it around pretty good. Holed a nice putt on the first and a great putt on the third. That said, still nervous the whole way around.  
  
  Q. And the card secured now?  
 GEORGE MURRAY: I hope so. Just go and try to play well the next few weeks and the get-go the job done.  
  
  Q. To do it here must be so satisfying?  
 GEORGE MURRAY: I've got a flight at 12 o'clock in the morning --  
  
  Q. Where are you off to?   
 GEORGE MURRAY: Madrid. I think I could struggle to make that.   
  
  Q. You said all year you've been looking forward to coming here and playing at home?  
 GEORGE MURRAY: Last week I genuinely thought, my preparation was not the best, but there you go. Just shows you, doesn't it. It's how it works out.   
  
  Q. You will go to Madrid?  
 GEORGE MURRAY: I'll definitely go.   
  
  Q. Where are you partying tonight?  
 GEORGE MURRAY: Get away from the whole golf thing and out with my pals.   
  
  Q. It's been a bit of a struggle, but was there a point where you really felt a low point?  
 GEORGE MURRAY: Wentworth was one of them because I hit the ball absolutely great at Wentworth and walked off with nothing, missed the cut. And I missed the cut after that, big events, really struggling mentally. When I say struggling mentally -- struggling mentally on the course but when I get home I'm all right. Missing cuts ...  
  
  Q. Jim's helped you with the putting?   
 GEORGE MURRAY: I've seen Jim. I've seen him over the years. I just need to start paying him -- (laughter).  
  
  Q. Luke say anything encouraging-wise?  
 GEORGE MURRAY: No, he seems to walk around in his own little world. But he chatted away really nice.   
  
  Q. You obviously enjoy this, but try and use this as a sort of spring board now?  
 GEORGE MURRAY: Any other season, always needed a good result, but it just makes you feel a bit more comfortable, and to do it in this field will do my World Ranking points some good.
