Q.
How did the course play different today for you?
PAUL STANKOWSKI:  It was a lot softer.  It wasn't as fast.  Obviously no wind blowing.  It was right there, played pretty easy really.

Q.
A lot of low scores?
PAUL STANKOWSKI:  Not on my card, but a lot of guys shot low.  This is more like the Memphis that we have all grown to love.

Q.
You had a lot more luck yesterday than most guys did.  What went different for you today?
PAUL STANKOWSKI:  I just didn't hit it quite as good.  I missed a couple putts, I had some three-putts, missed some short putts, so any time you do that, it doesn't help the score card.  So that was the difference really, putting.
Q.
What do you have to do to step it up over these next couple of days?
PAUL STANKOWSKI:  Hit it closer, make more putts.
Q.
It's that simple?
PAUL STANKOWSKI:  It's a simple game.
