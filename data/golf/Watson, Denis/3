  Q. Great shot on 9.   
 DENIS WATSON: Oh, yeah, that was about the only highlight of my week so far.   
  
  Q. Take us through it?  
 DENIS WATSON: I hit a 3-wood off the tee and just a little off the fairway. And hit a 9-iron from 144 and I jarred it.   
 So that was sort a surprise that it went in.  
  
  Q. Pretty solid round, what are you expecting to do tomorrow?  
 DENIS WATSON: Just hope I play better. I've been playing so indifferently that -- I've had a bad knee and I feel I can't hit it at the moment. I'm hitting it shorter than I normally do and it hasn't been going that well for me. But it's difficult as it is.
