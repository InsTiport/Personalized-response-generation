 Q. Birdie on the 18, nice way to finish your round? 
 DENIS WATSON: Yeah, very, very fortunate. I hit my second shot a little fat trying to hit it too hard, so I was lucky.

 Q. Standing here now, the breeze seems to have picked up, how has that affected things?
 DENIS WATSON: We didn't get too much of it, just the last hole was long and pretty hard. We were fortunate. The rain could make it a little tricky for it the guys. There's a lot of disaster on this golf course, if you hit it off-line, you can have a lot of problems.

 Q. Fred Funk has a nice lead at the moment but you're nicely tucked in just behind, so everything to look forward to for the next couple of days. 
 DENIS WATSON: Yeah, you know, you never know in golf. This is a course where it's important to be driving it straight, that's a key here, you have to drive it in the fairway. 

 Q. And how do you find the way Sunningdale has been set up this week?
 DENIS WATSON: They have done an incredible job.
