 Q.  Happy with that 70?  
CARLY BOOTH: Not really.  I left a lot of shots out there.   
 Q.  A day for making a score?  
CARLY BOOTH: Yeah, I didn't make the most of the par 5s.  It's just one of those courses where you miss on the wrong side of the fairway and you give yourself a lot of hard work.  So I put myself in a couple of fairway bunkers.   
 Q.  Course was quite short?  
CARLY BOOTH: Yeah, they put the tees forward on a couple of holes.  It's one of those things, it's not necessarily helpful.  It's just one of those things, they just put them forward.  I would have thought they would have done that tomorrow.  The weather is supposed to be bad tomorrow, not today.   
 Q.  For somebody like yourself, a reasonable hitter, kind of upset?  
CARLY BOOTH: Yeah, I didn't hit my driver very well today.  That let me down.  Putting was fine.  My short game was okay, too.  I missed a couple short putts, but, I made a few, as well.  Overall it was better.  I wish my tee shots -- missed too many fairways.   
 Q.  A couple decent birdies or anything that stood out?  
CARLY BOOTH: No, not really.  I wish I could tell.
