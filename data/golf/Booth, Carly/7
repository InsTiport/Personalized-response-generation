Q. How was that today?
CARLY BOOTH: It was pretty brutal to be honest.  Played good golf today apart from the 4-putt from five feet.  Tried to trickle in that on the 15th, was just stupid.  Apart from that, it was good golf.
Q. Did the conditions affect the putt?
CARLY BOOTH: Just maybe a little bit lack of time.  I rushed the putt and then it went a little bit -- it's just one of those, forget about it now.  I'll kick myself for a little bit but then tomorrow is a new day.
I hit the ball really good today.  My score doesn't do my golf any justice at all today.  So again, you've just got to hope for a better score tomorrow and keep battling away.  It's a battle out there.  It's not easy at all.  You have to try and take advantage of the birdies when you can and try and save the bogeys.  Putting is really key here.  I haven't been putting really well.  I putted all right yesterday, but today and the first day I struggled.
I obviously want to finish the best I can this week and hopefully it's Top-10.  I'll be happy with a Top-10.
