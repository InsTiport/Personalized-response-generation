 Q.  How do you feel after that?  
CARLY BOOTH: Just another bad day.  Two small putts I missed on 16 and 17.   
 Q.  Is that the kind of main problem at the minute, the putter?  
CARLY BOOTH: Not necessarily.  Just this week.  Struggled this week.   
 Q.  How many putts would you say in general?  
CARLY BOOTH: Too many.   
 Q.  Heading to Kingsbarns --  
CARLY BOOTH: Yeah, I'm looking forward to next week.  I'm playing good.  Just struggling right now.  I'll be fine.   
 Q.  How many times have you been in Kingsbarns in preparation?  
CARLY BOOTH: Last time I played was the qualifier for the British women's when it was at St. Andrews, so 2013.  So I haven't played since then.  But I have played it quite a number of times before that.  So I am quite familiar with the course.   
 Q.  Was the pace of the greens here you didn't get used to?  
CARLY BOOTH: Just everything.  Line, pace.  I've always struggled on these greens every year.  I find them very hard to read.   
 Q.  Is it because they are designed to be slopey?  
CARLY BOOTH: A lot of slopes.  There's not a single straight putt out there.  When your confidence isn't up with it, it doesn't help.   
 Q.  Do you think you're quite hard on yourself sometimes?  
CARLY BOOTH: Maybe, but you know, you want to do the best you can, and when you finish badly, it's always a bummer.
