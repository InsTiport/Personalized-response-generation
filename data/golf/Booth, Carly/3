 Q.  Great round of 67.  Talk me through the round.  You started with a bogey.  
CARLY BOOTH: I started on 10.  My only bogey today was on the 1st, but that was my tenth hole.   
Apart from that, played very solid.  Can't really complain.  I mean, going into today, we've been very lucky with the weather to be honest.  We didn't really get much -- any rain, apart from our delay after our 12th hole.  We were lucky in the afternoon.   
Still a bit of a slog.  It's been a very long day.  I'm quite happy with my game.   
 Q.  How did the course look?  A lot of rain this morning.  
CARLY BOOTH: Yeah, very surprised.  It was in great condition, considering how much rain we've had.  It's holding up very well.  Hopefully the rain can calm down for the weekend now.   
 Q.  So far you're making the most of the sponsor's invitation.  Any thoughts back to 2012 when you're out there today?  
CARLY BOOTH: Not really.  I played with the leader out there today.  She killed it, shot 9-under.  She did not waste a single shot or putt today.  I see what the best are doing this week, so I've just got to keep focused, keep playing my game and you never know.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy playing with somebody who is playing with that sort of quality?  Does it help spur you along?  
CARLY BOOTH: Definitely.  It's always great to see good golf.  When you see that, it kind of makes you want to play good golf, too.  It was a great threesome we had the last two days, so you know, looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  Did you have any support out there for you today?  
CARLY BOOTH: Today, no.  Just my caddie, he was my support.  Yeah, I told my family not to bother today because I knew the weather was going to be so bad, but they were all out yesterday, so that kind of cheered me on for the rest of this week.
