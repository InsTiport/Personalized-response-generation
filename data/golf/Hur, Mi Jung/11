 Q.   Talk us through your round.   
MI JUNG HUR:   I had a good round today.   Little struggle with my shots on front nine, but my putter and chip shot, short game, save me today.  
So I think I like it.  
   
 Q.   A good recovery at the end to get up‑and‑down for par on 18.   
MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah, I missed a fairway on No. 18 and I tried to hit it with 5 hybrid, but it was a little thick rough.   
Had a lucky bounce from in the hazard.   I think I hit some rocks and bounce out and then saved the par.  
   
 Q.   Talk us through the birdies.   
MI JUNG HUR:   Birdies?   
   
 Q.   Tell us about your birdies.   
MI JUNG HUR:   Cannot remember.   There's two on front nine and three on back nine.   I think I had a good putting all day, except No. 17.   I missed a.  
Short par putt.   But I will take today's round.  
   
 Q.   It's actually quite mild as we speak, but earlier in the round the wind picked up.   Were the conditions harder today than yesterday?  
MI JUNG HUR:   No in this morning it was a little chilly and we had rain gear on, so it's hard to swing it perfectly.  
But after the nine holes sun gets hotter and hotter and weather is getting better.   Warm up quickly.  
   
 Q.   Talk us through your mindset going into the weekend.   
MI JUNG HUR:   I don't think about anything like win or the Top 10s, because I'm just going to focus on my each shot.   If I am on the tee ground I am gonna focus on my driver.   If I am on the fairway I'm gonna focus on that shot like that.  
It really helps me more than think about the winning.
