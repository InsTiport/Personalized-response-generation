   MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, M.J. Hur, 1-under par, 70. Everybody talked about how difficult this golf course was before they teed off, and yet the rounds have been quite good. I mean, you're tied for the lead right now. 
 Just tell us how you felt about the golf course. 
 M.J. HUR: You know, this course is very tough for us, because it's 66,000 -- over 66,000 -- is it...
 MODERATOR: 6,600.
 M.J. HUR: 6,600 yards, yes, with par 71. They are very tough to hit the fairway, and greens, greens are so fast with a lot of slopes. 
 If I hit good shot, it still goes I don't know where this ball going. I just think about my safety shot. Hit the fairway and hit the green. Just two putts. That was my goal today.
 MODERATOR: You achieved that goal, didn't you? 
 M.J. HUR: Yes.
 MODERATOR: Yes, you did. 
 M.J. HUR: It was working.
 MODERATOR: Oh, good. You started on hole No. 1, front nine.
 M.J. HUR: Yes.
 MODERATOR: You birdied the 3rd hole. What club did you hit into the green, and how long was your putt? 
 M.J. HUR: You know, I missed the fairway at that hole. Ball goes left in the bunker, but it kicks out to the mound. Do you know the bunker has a mound, like a lot of mounds.
 MODERATOR: Yes, it does. The church pews they call it. 
 M.J. HUR: Yes. My ball was there, and I hit 7-iron. It was 25 yards short, and I hit 58 chipping and it rolls in. That's why the birdie at that hole.
 MODERATOR: That was a good birdie. And then you bogeyed No. 6.
 M.J. HUR: I hit 7-iron into the left bunker, and from the bunker has three yards par putt, but I miss it. 
 MODERATOR: About nine feet? 
 M.J. HUR: Nine feet? I don't know what it is. 
 MODERATOR: That's close. Then you had a lot of pars until No. 11, and you birdied that hole. What did you hit to the green? 
 M.J. HUR: I hit 9-iron, and it rolls maybe 12 yards, and -- nine feet, same.
 MODERATOR: Nine feet again. You made a birdie and then you parred in. You must be very pleased with how you played today? 
 M.J. HUR: I'm very happy with my score today. 
 MODERATOR: All right. I haven't had a chance to look up how you've done in the Women's Open in the past. What has been your best finish? 
 M.J. HUR: This is my second time to play U.S. Women's Open, but I play last year but I missed the cut with bad shots and bad putt. 
 But that things goes away, so I want to keep this momentum till Sunday. It would be great.
 MODERATOR: Have you made any significant changes in your game recently or in your equipment? 
 M.J. HUR: Change? After? 
 MODERATOR: Have you made any changes in your swing or your putting stroke or in your equipment recently, just getting ready for this championship? 
 M.J. HUR: Yeah, I change my swing just a little bit to more consistent. My driver was very bad last year, so I find out what is the problem and working on driver shot a lot. 
 So right now it's very comfortable with my driver, and I like my putter. So it will be great happen on Sunday. I really look forward... 
 MODERATOR: To playing this course? 
 M.J. HUR: Yes.
 MODERATOR: Who is your instructor.
 M.J. HUR: Tony Ziegler. 
 MODERATOR: Where is he located? 
 M.J. HUR: He's from Florida, Orange County. 
 MODERATOR: That was a wonderful round. Thank you so much for joining us. We look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
