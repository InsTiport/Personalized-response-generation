   MODERATOR: M.J., welcome. We'll start it out just kind of give your thoughts overall on the week and on the finish.  
 M.J. HUR: You know, I finished second. I think it's good because I played good final round, but Ai, she played really good and did much better than me.   
  
  Q. You made those three birdies finishing up with three straight birdies. I mean what -- did you just find your swing at that point or what got you going, you know, the final three holes there?  
 M.J. HUR: I saw the scoreboard on 16. I was tied maybe fourth, and I just wanted to finish second, so I tried to make a birdie the last three holes, but, you know, the ball goes in.   
 No. 16 I chipped it in, so that made me tied for second, and No. 17, that putt made me second. So I like it.   
  
  Q. Did you think that if I told you you had the score at the end of the round, did you think it would be good enough or did you foresee people walking you down the way that I did?   
 M.J. HUR: I don't understand.   
 MODERATOR: Did you think at the beginning of the day if you were given 14-under par, do you think that would have been good enough to win?   
 M.J. HUR: My goal was 4-under par today, so it made me 15-under par, but that's not enough. 16-under par. So I'm good with my score. I'm happy for my score today.   
  
  Q. This is the fourth time that Ai has won this year and she's the new No. 1. What are players saying about her game and just how she's kind of dominating right now?  
 M.J. HUR: I play with her in Sybase Match Play, second round. She's just gorgeous. She hits straight and has good putts, so I think she play really simple. I want to be playing that, too.   
 MODERATOR: Anything else? All right.  
 M.J. HUR: Happy Father's Day. Thank you.
