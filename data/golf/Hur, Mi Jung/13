Q.   Great round.   Very solid.   No bogeys.   How did you feel?
MI JUNG HUR:   It was really solid round, because I had a struggled year, like last week.   But my shot's getting better and better, and trying to find my confidence again.
Like today I tried to focus on my each shot.   Like if you're on the teeing ground, just try to focus on driver and then if you go to fairway, try to focus on the iron shot like this.   Because I read the interview from So Yeon Ryu.
From last week.   She did like that. 
You know, when I won this tournament back on '09, that's what I did at the time. 

Q.   Just shot by shot?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.   Shot by shot.   And then like today I just did it.   So that's why I had a good round today.

Q.   So you thought just staying in the present on that one shot was the most important thing?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.

Q.   Have you been struggling with that?
MI JUNG HUR:   Kind of because my shot wasn't that good like two years, and has been my swing changed a lot.   So I lose a lot of confidence from my swing and feeling. 
So I tried to find my old‑‑

Q.   Yeah.   Your old self. 
MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah.   So it worked today.

Q.   Have you been changing anything recently?   What have you been working on recently?
MI JUNG HUR:   My swing. 

Q.   Just in general?
MI JUNG HUR:   I used to hit played with a fade shot a lot, but right now I try to hit a draw a little bit.   It's a really big difference.

Q.   Difference with the draw?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.   It's like tiny things change.   But for me it's like whole swings are changed.   So I was confused.   It's getting better.   I feel good.

Q.   What do you think was the key to managing your rounds today?   Putting, drives?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.   I changed my putter on Wednesday during the pro am.

Q.   Of this week?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.   After nine holes, the pro am.

Q.   During the pro am. 
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.   During the pro am.

Q.   Was it like the amateur's putter or whose putter was it?   You had two putters?
MI JUNG HUR:   No.   I just ordered a new putter from Odyssey.   I used to have that putter like a long time ago.   I just grabbed bag.

Q.   What kind is it?
MI JUNG HUR:   It's blade, No. 2 Versa. 

Q.   Okay.   Odyssey. 
MI JUNG HUR:   And yesterday, I mean the first round I had a little inconsistent with my putter, the speed.   So I tried to find my speed today.   It worked very well.

Q.   Yeah.   With 26 putts?
MI JUNG HUR:   I don't know.   I didn't count it.

Q.   It was pretty low.   So you felt good on the greens?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.

Q.   Just finding the speed was a big help?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah.   Especially this course they are really firm greens and fast.   So you have to focus on the putting every shot.

Q.   How big was the par save here?   How hard was that shot?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah.   That was hard.

Q.   Tough shot?
MI JUNG HUR:   Missed the fairway to the left and tried to hit a draw because the trees are in play.   I had 144 yards to the pin and hit a 9‑iron. 
I carried pin high on the draw, super fast. 

Q.   I guess since this is the spot, Portland of your one win, how special does it feel to be back?   Do you have more memories coming back to the town where you win?   Do you always feel good?
MI JUNG HUR:   I'm so comfortable with this town, especially I love the shopping in Oregon.   There's no sales tax.   I love it.   And my American parents I just talked to about it, I met them maybe '05, back to '05 in Pumpkin Ridge.   I played the U. S. women's amateur.   And I met them.

Q.   Kept in touch ever since?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah.   I met a lot of lovely people here, and they're all nice.   Even the courses are super conditioned. 

Q.   So feel good?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah.   I feel good.

Q.   Favorite store here?   What are the stores, Nike?
MI JUNG HUR:   Adidas.

Q.   Perfect.   They're both here.   Might as well go to one or the other?
MI JUNG HUR:   I went there three times already this week.

Q.   Should I ask how much the damage was or no?   How much clothes did you get?   Sneakers?
MI JUNG HUR:   I got‑‑ I spend 600.

Q.   I think you'll be set for a while. 
MI JUNG HUR:   If I make that one birdie tomorrow, it's going to fix it‑‑ I mean what is it.

Q.   Even out? 
MI JUNG HUR:   If I made one birdie, it's going to be even. 

Q.   Yes. 
MI JUNG HUR:   More than even. 

Q.   Well, thank you for your time.
