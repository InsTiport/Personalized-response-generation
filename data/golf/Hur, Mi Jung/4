Q. Always nice to finish with a birdie, and your 5-under moves you into a share of the lead.  How happy are you with that?
MI JUNG HUR: I'm really satisfied with my round today, because I shoot 4-under par on the front nine but had lots of chance to make a birdie on the back nine, as well.  But my putting didn't drop much, but I'm really satisfied with my round.
Q. Do you think conditions changed a little on the greens after the rain?  Was it a little bit more difficult to read the speed of the greens?
MI JUNG HUR: Well, I think it's pretty much the same.  But it was really hard to read the break, because I think the greens are pretty brand new.  Also it's hard to stop the ball from the second shot.  I think that's the biggest thing on the golf course to think about it.
Q. But you finished very well.  And I was asking you a little earlier on about changes that you made to your swing.  Can you tell us a little bit more about that and why you felt that you had to make the change?
MI JUNG HUR: I was working on my swing since 2011 I think.  But finally last year, find my swing pretty well.  Still think about those kind of things.  I think it working pretty good now.  It goes more straighter, farther.  I want to keep this swing till end of the season.
