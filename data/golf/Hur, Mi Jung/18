  Q. How many holes had you finished before the delay?  
     M.J. HUR: Today?   
  
  Q. Yeah.   
     M.J. HUR: I played three holes, and I'm on the fairway No.4.  
  
  Q. No.4?  
     M.J. HUR: Yeah.  
  
  Q. You got a birdie on was it No. 1?  
     M.J. HUR: It was 2nd one.  
  
  Q. No. 2?  
     M.J. HUR: Yes.  
  
  Q. Long putt? How did you make the birdie on No. 2?  
     M.J. HUR: I hit 8-iron and 12-footer putt.  
  
  Q. Again, you had only played a couple holes, but when you were playing well and you want to keep going and you have a delay like this - and I don't know if we're gonna come back today or tomorrow - do you worry, Oh, can I keep my momentum going for tomorrow? Is this just something that you deal with all the time?  
     M.J. HUR: It's not a problem, because everybody are same, same thing: we play and come back in here and go back out to play. It's doesn't matter.  
  
  Q. Whether you go back out today or tomorrow, with all the rain the course is probably gonna be a lot different, isn't it? Wouldn't you think?  
     M.J. HUR: Uh-huh.  
  
  Q. Not as much roll or...   
     M.J. HUR: Yeah, I think like this morning, they play really earlier this morning, like 7:40 something. At this time, the fairway was really firm and bounce a lot because it's dry. I think they hit like 300 yards.  
     But right now, courses are really wet, so 250 something. It's more harder.  
  
  Q. Yeah. So whether it's today or maybe coming back in the morning. Tomorrow could be a pretty long day, couldn't it?   
     M.J. HUR: Definitely. And I heard that there is another storm coming tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah.   
     M.J. HUR: Hopefully sunshine.   
  
  Q. Yeah. I guess right now, you're tied with Cristie for the lead. There's a long way to go. I think you said yesterday, as far as being in the lead, being nervous, when you came out here today, did you feel -- being in the last group were you nervous, or was it fun?   
     M.J. HUR: I feel every days are same. I mean, same nervous and same focus, so...  
     Today I think just comfortable.   
  
  Q. How do you do that? How do you keep yourself like that? How do you make every day the same?  
     M.J. HUR: I just think about more positive, more enjoy the golf, not serious. It is serious, but I try to feels like enjoy.   
  
  Q. What did you do during the delay?   
     M.J. HUR: I just sit down and eating. Everyone eating up there.
