 Q.  (Regarding final five holes.)  
MI JUNG HUR: I'm definitely happy.  So exciting to play those five holes, like short par-5 and short par-5, chance to eagle.  So I made two eagles on second round.   
Anyway, it was very exciting.  It was good experience.   
 Q.  So a lot of fans say that final five hole will impact on your score.  So did you feel deal that?  
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah, I felt that, but the problem was I start today's round with two bogeys on first two holes, which is very frustrating.   
But I made four birdies on final five so I'm pretty satisfied with my round today.   
 Q.  How do you adjust yourself for the mental?  
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah, I tried to make birdie all five of them, but I missed 17, which the green wasn't that good on No. 17.   
Anyway, very happy.
