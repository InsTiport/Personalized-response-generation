Q.   Very nice round once again.   How did you feel throughout the whole round?   Very good up until obviously maybe the blip on the back nine. 
MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah, I had a good round all day long except the No. 16, the par‑3.   I hit a chip shit from right side of the green and the ball just roll into the hazard and made a triple ‑‑ triple?   Lose three strokes from there unfortunately.
But I satisfied for this round because the pin position was so tough all day long.

Q.   Yeah. 
MI JUNG HUR:   But I satisfied.

Q.   Good.   Now, I wanted to ask you about playing well in Portland.   You played your way into this event this week.   Did you have any game plan coming into this, not knowing if you would play or not the past couple weeks, or did you expect to be playing?
MI JUNG HUR:   I think my long game were getting better and better.   In Portland and this week my putting really doing well.
But I have tough day with the putter today. 

Q.   I know you said in Portland you have been really concentrating on staying shot by shot and in the moment. 
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.

Q.   How has that been going this week?
MI JUNG HUR:   I keep try to do that.   I will do it tomorrow. 

Q.   That's the game plan tomorrow?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes. 

Q.   Okay. 
MI JUNG HUR:   Because if you think about like win or top 3, something like that, it's really hard to focus on the ball. 
You have to think like, Oh, this putt is for like second place, something like that, it's not helpful. 

Q.   How much did Portland help coming into this week with confidence, feeling in the mix of things?   I know you said it had been a while.   How much did that week help this week?
MI JUNG HUR:   It helps a lot, because I shoot 7‑under in Portland on second round.   It made me my confidence bring it back, so I think that helps a lot from the Portland.

Q.   What did you do during the off week?   Anything? 
MI JUNG HUR:   Off week?   Last week? 

Q.   Yeah.   In between. 
MI JUNG HUR:   Portland was fourth tournament in a row, so I just take five days off in Dallas and starting to practice on Friday. 
I think it refresh my condition, so...

Q.   That helped?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.

Q.   Perfect.   What about caddies?   I know you had a local caddie in Portland.   Another local caddie?
MI JUNG HUR:   They're all 22 years old. 

Q.   Is he local here in France?
MI JUNG HUR:   Yes.

Q.   Can you speak with him?
MI JUNG HUR:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   How long have you been using local caddies?
MI JUNG HUR:   Two weeks.

Q.   So just Portland and here?
MI JUNG HUR:   I think I work good with local caddie.

Q.   Yeah, you tell them what to do.   Okay.   Game plan for tomorrow?   Anything you want to improve on from today? 
MI JUNG HUR:   I hope the pin position is a little bit easier tomorrow, but nobody knows. 

Q.   Can't control that. 
MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah.
