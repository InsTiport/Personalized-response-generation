THE MODERATOR: You played so well yesterday and today, two days in a row 63.  Today no bogey, right?  Six birdies for today and 10-under par.  What has been working out so well for you?   
MI JUNG HUR: For today I think my iron shot and putting doing well, but I miss two birdie opportunities in the front nine.   
THE MODERATOR: Which hole?   
MI JUNG HUR: I think was third hole.  No. 9 is par-5 and Brooke and Shanshan made a birdie and I didn't made a birdie.  So I was frustrated, but I made five birdie on the back nine so I satisfied with my round today.   
THE MODERATOR: Brooke and Shanshan both are long hitters.  I check your number, the average driving distance.  It's over 260 yards, right?  So you're hitting the ball miles as well.  I know this golf course favors long hitter, so what's it going to be like with the three long hitters standing out on the tee?  You're in contention.  What can you take into tomorrow's play?  It's going to be very competitive play.   
MI JUNG HUR: I play Shanshan and Brooke today and tomorrow as well.  They both are my favorite player on the tour, so I just want to enjoy the game with them.  Actually it's hard to enjoy with them.  Try to enjoy, yeah, that game with them.   
I just want to focus on my every shot.  That's the most important thing I've ever had.  Like crowd here is a little bit noisy, but they're really fine.   
THE MODERATOR: Noisy?   
MI JUNG HUR: Like they take a photo.   
THE MODERATOR: Oh, I'm sorry.  We're sorry.   
MI JUNG HUR: No, no.  It's fine.  You get used to it so I don't care.   
Yeah, I just wasn't to focus on my ball every shot.   
THE MODERATOR: Are you sure you can focus?  Because today is day three of the tournament, but day one for Chinese National Holiday.  Tomorrow going to be lots of Chinese fans come to cheer for you, maybe cheer for Chinese player.  So are you sure you can focus on your play, and how and what will you reply if Chinese fans cheer and just don't know the game of the golf?   
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah, I'm not sure about focus, but I mean, at least I have to try.  I just want to set my goal.   
THE MODERATOR: What's your goal?   
MI JUNG HUR: My career record for 72 holes was 21-under par when I won the Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic in 2014.   
Yeah, I just want to break that record.  If I set my goal and focus more about that it will help me to focus.   
 Q.  Two questions.  There are many Korean girls on the LPGA Tour.  Did you learn something local?  I mean, some simple Chinese languages?  How much did you learn?  Show us.  
MI JUNG HUR: I only know --   
THE MODERATOR: Other than ni hao.   
MI JUNG HUR: (In Chinese.)   
THE MODERATOR: Okay.  That means I'm sorry.   
MI JUNG HUR: I know the number.   
THE MODERATOR: Oh, you know the number?   
MI JUNG HUR: (In Chinese. ) (Applause).   
THE MODERATOR: So tomorrow there may be a lot of changing back.  Golf fans will be after you, cheer for you, so how will you make them feel more excited during play?  How will you make them happy?  They come to you and cheer you.  How will you reply them?  Maybe we are using Chinese local way.   
MI JUNG HUR: How is that?   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, xie xie, so stuff like that.   
MI JUNG HUR: Okay.  If I made a birdie, whatever hole is, and they clap and cheer me up, I will just say, Xie xie.   
THE MODERATOR: That's it?   
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah.  Easiest word.   
THE MODERATOR: Yeah, xie xie.  When you win the championship we'll teach you some tough ones.  Okay?  (Laughter.)   
We noticed you always get good performance on the back nine.  Everybody know yesterday you got two eagle on the back nine, and today just one birdie on the front nine; five birdies on the back nine.  So we want to know did you get any advice from your caddie Tom or you just think maybe this back nine is quite easy for you?   
MI JUNG HUR: I think because of the Red Bull Challenge final five, like No. 14 through 18, yeah.  Because there is a big sign on the tee box.  It makes me more focus.   
THE MODERATOR: Kind of different colors, right?   
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah, because we never have those kind of challenge on the tour.   
THE MODERATOR: So only this tournament?   
MI JUNG HUR: Yes.  It's so special.  So I really wish win that challenge.  I will do my best tomorrow as well.   
THE MODERATOR: Talk about your record is 21-under par at the Yokohama 2014 LPGA Classic.  We think this score is tough to claim the title.  In inaugural event the winning score was 26-under par.  What do you think your winning score will be?  Even, or break the first year's record?   
MI JUNG HUR: I think nobody knows about the winning score for this year, so I just want to set my goal and try to get it.  After that I can think about it.   
THE MODERATOR: All right.  Who knows?  Nobody knows.   
MI JUNG HUR: Right.  Nobody knows the score.  I don't want to think about the scores on the course, but there is a scoreboard every hole.  I mean, I can see it even I don't want to see.  But I just want to --   
THE MODERATOR: I guess maybe you will break the record.  Yeah, I guess you will break the record.  Okay.   
You're in the media room two days in a row and we notice you always smile at every shot.  You love to smile.  Talk us through your front nine and the 8th and the 9th on your front nine.  The 8th where you hit the second shot, approach the green, you short of the green, right?  Shanshan made the birdie.  You made the par at No. 9, right?   
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: You felt a little bit struggling.  How will you overcome that pressure or struggling feeling after the turn?   
MI JUNG HUR: I didn't feel any struggle because my shot and putting was good, but No. 9, the ball just stop right beside the hole.   
My birdie opportunities just stop by the hole.  Like I thought was in the hole but it didn't.  After that I didn't feel bad about it.   
THE MODERATOR: Maybe in front nine the 7th and the 8th you didn't make the birdie, but in the back nine, in your back nine, you made five birdies of the six today.  So do you feel any pressure when you feel struggling?  And how come five birdies of six today your back nine?   
MI JUNG HUR: I mean, on the back nine just everything works really well.  I mean, front nine, yeah, I think it's all about the putter.  Didn't work on the front nine but works on the back nine.   
THE MODERATOR: So what were the key today on the back nine, the putting game?   
MI JUNG HUR: Yes.   
THE MODERATOR: All right.
