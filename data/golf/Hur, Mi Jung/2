 Q.  Another great day of near the top of the leaderboard.  How are you feeling?  
MI JUNG HUR: Definitely feel very, very good right now because I finish with a birdie on the last.  Was huge, long putt.  I'm getting excited to playing tomorrow.   
 Q.  How long do you think that putt was on 18?  
MI JUNG HUR: My caddie said was like 67 feet.   
 Q.  Nice.  
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah.  I think that's the longest putt I've ever made in my life.   
 Q.  Wow.  
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah.   
 Q.  That's awesome.  How are you feeling going into tomorrow being near the top of the leaderboard?  
MI JUNG HUR: I just want to stay positive and still be patient for those greens.  Actually was good today and my putter was good.  A little bit struggle with my iron shot.   
But I will just stay be patient and keep focus on my ball.  Just play like today.   
 Q.  Does hitting a putt like you did on 18 give you momentum going into tomorrow or something you have to forget about and start new?  
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah, I will definitely restart, you know, like final round.  But that helps a lot, the last putt.  Put me second place.   
Look forward to play tomorrow.   
 Q.  You said it was 67-foot putt?  
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah.
