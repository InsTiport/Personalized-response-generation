   MODERATOR: M. J. Hur, second straight 66. Tell us about the round.
 M. J. HUR: I play really solid today. You know, I miss a lot of greens, but my chipping and puttings save me a lot. 
 I mean, I had two chip-it-in birdie today, so I think it's really lucky.
 MODERATOR: What were the... 
 M. J. HUR: Oh, the first hole, I play on back nine first, so I make No. 10, I chip it in, and No. 14, par-3.
 MODERATOR: Wow. So you made the birdie on your 10th hole, and then I think you made three straight on, what was it, 12, 13, and 14? 
 M. J. HUR: Yeah.
 MODERATOR: Not only making four birdies in your first five holes, but also your first hole was a chip-in birdie. Does that do anything for you mentally for the rest of the round? 
 M. J. HUR: You know, my shot was left/right, left/right. But chip-ins are great, so made me more comfortable and confident, so...
 That's why I'm better shape right now.
 MODERATOR: Cool. Questions. 

 Q. (Question regarding the course conditions and wind.)
 M. J. HUR: No, it was windy in the morning, so it's much tougher than yesterday. And, you know, last hole I tried to putt like 12-footer, but the rains are this big come down, so it will be starting -- I think the afternoon tee times will be tough, unfortunately. (Laughing.) 

 Q. 66 yesterday. The way you got that 66 today, was it a lot different than yesterday?
 M. J. HUR: No, it's really exactly same like two rounds. Same shots today, same short game today. 

 Q. Traditionally, do you take a lot of pride in your short game? Have you had a pretty good short game throughout your career?
 M. J. HUR: My short game was really bad when I play on Futures Tour. I mean, like before that. So I tried to practice a lot on my short game.
 Right now I'm more comfortable with the short game. 

 Q. When you first came out and you played on the Future's Tour, when did you realize that maybe you needed maybe a more well-rounded game and improve your short game? Was it kind of during your time on the Future's Tour when you realized, I really need to work on chipping stuff?
 M. J. HUR: Yes, during the Future's Tour. Last year I feel a lot, because a lot of top player has a great short game. So it made me practice, keep practice. 

 Q. You talked about the wind. This obviously happens when the wind changes directions. Today I guess it was out of south. Were there a few holes that played maybe differently today than yesterday as far as the club you had to use? 
 M. J. HUR: You know, few holes really backwind, I mean, helping me a lot. So like par-5, if I hit a driver, I grab 4-hybrid, 3-hybrid. So easy birdie. 
 But some holes, par-4, hit driver and 3-hybrid. It's level. 

 Q. Did you bogey 10?
 M. J. HUR: The first hole. 

 Q. The first hole?
 M. J. HUR: Yes.

 Q. Oh, that's right. What happened there? It was a par-5, right?
 M. J. HUR: Yes. My driver went to left under the tree. But it was not bad, so I hit 6-iron to layup and tried to get birdie. 
 But I saw the ball was in the divot, so I take one more clubs. It was 105 yards. I hit pitching wedge, but too solid. It goes all the way through the bunker. That happens.

 Q. So you were in the bunker?
 M. J. HUR: Yes. 

 Q. For this year, this season, as far as midway through a tournament, is this the best position you've been in like midway through, or have other times have you been really in contention like halfway through? 
 M. J. HUR: Yes. I mean, this is my first time on the leaderboard after second round. You know, I had one last year, won one last year in Safeway Classic. 
 But that was like 20 something, but I shoot 7-under par the final round. So I'm exciting. 

 Q. Going into tomorrow, you're either going to be at the top of the leaderboard or very close to it. Maybe in the final group. As far as nerves or anything, do you think you'll handle that okay?
 M. J. HUR: Definitely nervous, but I will try to calm down and focus on my ball. If I made a birdie or a bogey, it doesn't matter. Just keep myself calm down. 
 So I think if I did that, it will bring me great happen. 

 Q. I read that somebody mentioned that you really like to play video games. Do you think you play them more than the average person?
 M. J. HUR: Yes, I think like 24 hours day. I had like five hours with iPhone and Nintendo DS or computer. I love play games. 

 Q. Since you were young, or has it just been kind of the last few years where you really started doing that a lot as far as video games and stuff?
 M. J. HUR: I think I'm still young. (Laughter.) That's why I play video games.

 Q. When you were younger. 
 M. J. HUR: Yes. 

 Q. Again, the little thing about your bio said you like to play something called Sudden Attack. 
 M. J. HUR: How do you know? 

 Q. Is that true? What's the objective? What does that have to do with Sudden Attack?
 M. J. HUR: That's like shooting game with a gun. It's really funny with the other person that's like online. You have to login with the Internet, and like it's team match. Eight people -- I mean, eight person. Try to kill, and it looks like real. (Laughter.)

 Q. You don't look like someone who would want to kill people. 
 M. J. HUR: No. Stress goes away. I'm not that person. (Laughter.)
