  Q. All the times you've watched the Masters and the best players on Sunday come to No. 12 tee, and now you get there today, what's going through your mind?
 OLIVIA MEHAFFEY:   It was a bad number.  I was really in between two clubs and I just tried to hit it hard and I probably didn't even need to and then I hit it fat.  But once I was in the situation, I was kind of thinking, giving myself a chance at a bogey and get out.  I think seeing what Tiger did last year was a little bit scary, and the hole is very intimidating, even that short wedge shot is difficult.  I was trying to get out.
 Q. What clubs?
 OLIVIA MEHAFFEY:   I hit a 9-iron but I was right between a 9 and an 8.
 Q. And you hit 9?
 OLIVIA MEHAFFEY:   I hit 9.  Tried to hit it hard and caught it heavy, yeah.
 Q. What was going through your mind, you had to think you were still right there.
 OLIVIA MEHAFFEY:   Yeah, of course, even after that, I was thinking okay, I can get some birdies.  Nobody was running away with it.  I think it's been pretty tight the whole day.
 So that was -- you know, I was still thinking, try and get some birdies and I thought I hit a really nice shot into 13 and I would love to watch it back; a few feet away from being pretty good.  But yeah, I still felt like I was still in it.
 Q. You played a practice round here last year, too.
 OLIVIA MEHAFFEY:   And the tournament two years ago.
 Q. Today how much different was this experience?
 OLIVIA MEHAFFEY:   It's very different when you're in contention and I wasn't in contention last time.  It's definitely a different feeling out there and there was definitely a lot more people than I thought and it was very nice.  Yeah, it's very different when you're in contention and you're not just playing and trying to enjoy it.
 Q. Look forward to coming back?
 OLIVIA MEHAFFEY:   I'm going to turn pro soon.
 Q. But you'd visit this place?
 OLIVIA MEHAFFEY:   Oh, gosh, in a heartbeat, I'd love to.  Unbelievable.  Just lives up to every expectation and more.
