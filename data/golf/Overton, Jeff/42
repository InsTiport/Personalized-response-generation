 Q. 1-under 69, 5-under, four back. A couple comments on the round today and the plan for tomorrow. 
 JEFF OVERTON: Probably one of the best ball-striking rounds so far. I didn't putt it well. I missed a bunch of putts. If I could have putted like I did that first round, I could have really put myself up there in contention. But I'm just glad to see the ball-striking coming around because if we can do that again tomorrow and we can get everything firing with the putter, too, get everything on the same cylinder tomorrow, we can do pretty good.

 Q. On a course like this that's obviously playing hard, it levels the playing field. Are you playing well enough to win, or would you rather be playing on a course that yields a lot more birdies? 
 JEFF OVERTON: I think that any time you're going to play a really tough, challenging golf course, it's great. You have the opportunity on Sunday just to try to come back from behind. It's going to be tough. Justin is 10-under, so I'm five back or whatever, and the guy goes and shoots even or 1-under tomorrow, it's going to be awful hard.
