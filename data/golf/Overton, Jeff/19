 Q. You made a huge jump.   You came in 83rd this week and now you're 38th and you accomplished your main goal of playing at home.   That must feel great.   
JEFF OVERTON:   Yeah, it really does.   I really wanted to play at Crooked Stick all year.   It's kind of been circled on the schedule of things to do this year, and just I really wanted to get in there.   Today it was hard looking at it last night knowing you've got to shoot probably 3‑ or 4‑over because that's the last thing you want to think about doing, and there's nothing more nerve wracking and thinking about shooting over par.   But Phil on the first day was great, he said, let's have a good day, we'll go make a whole lot of birdies, and it kind of just clicked in my mind a little bit and shot a few under, and it was a fun day.   He was awesome to play with.  
   
 Q.   Now more pressure next week because you have to impress family and friends, correct?  
JEFF OVERTON:   Yeah, it'll just be a fun week to be at home.   I've never really played a professional golf tournament in Indiana.   It'll be like a junior tournament, a couple college events.   It'll be really fun, looking forward to it, and nothing like Crooked Stick, too.  
   
 Q.   And you're playing well?  
JEFF OVERTON:   Yeah, absolutely.   Finally getting the putter going well, and hopefully we can keep it going and maybe got bigger goals now, I guess.  
   
 Q.   When John Daly won in '91 how old were you?  
JEFF OVERTON:   I would have been seven or eight.  
   
 Q.   And you were there, right?  
JEFF OVERTON:   I didn't even know what golf was at that time.   That would have been probably the last sport I would have been thinking about playing at age eight.   
   
 Q.   It'll be good to be back, though, right?  
JEFF OVERTON:   Absolutely, I'm really looking forward to it.
