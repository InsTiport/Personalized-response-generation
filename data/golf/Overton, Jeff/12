 Q.   You had some chances coming in, all in all a great week for you.   How pleased are you?  
JEFF OVERTON:   Yeah, pretty happy.   All in all I felt like my putter came around this week, even though I had a couple hiccups the last four or five holes.   Any time you finish in the top 5 and you have a chance to win, it's always fun.   It's just frustrating at the same time.   
   
 Q.   What does this do, maybe jump starting some big events for you coming up in the next couple of months?  
JEFF OVERTON:   Yeah, I looked at my track record, and these next five or six weeks, usually there's times I play pretty good.   It was nice to start off here good after two weeks off, and really looking forward to the next few weeks.   
   
 Q.   I know you gave it a good try out there today, a couple of putts just caught the lip and didn't drop, but still a good week?  
JEFF OVERTON:   Yeah, it was fun.   It's been a while since‑‑ all the way back to Hawai'i when I actually had a chance to win the last nine holes, so it was fun.   It's just unfortunately didn't make some of those short putts coming in, something that I was doing a really great job of all week, and it's frustrating, but what can you do.  
   
 Q.   What do you take away from this week?  
JEFF OVERTON:   All in all I felt like I drove the ball exceptionally well and chipped and putted it outstanding.   I've chipped in‑‑ I feel like I'm playing pretty good, so just kind of keep the ball moving here and take on next week.
