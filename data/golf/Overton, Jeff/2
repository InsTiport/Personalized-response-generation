A flash interview with:
JEFF OVERTON
Q. Well, Jeff, started with a bogey.  Just talked with William McGirt.  He said it was a pretty hard start.
JEFF OVERTON: Yeah, hit probably one of the best shots of the day, hit a 9-iron in there to like 154.  It was cold.  Thing landed like eight feet short of the green.  It was like laying on ice or something.  It shot right over.
Q. After that it looks like you got used to it, the birdies on the day, six of them.
JEFF OVERTON: Yeah, I just kinda kept plugging along.  Got to watch him hit a couple of shots first.  He was playing really well.  Could kinda see how the ball was really bouncing hard early.
The greens are still firm but definitely softened up just a little bit.  Hard golf course today.  I played really well.  I didn't realize I shot 5-under until I got done.  Felt like kind of a 2-under par round, kinda scraping around and getting by.  The birdies came at the right time.
Q. You had that birdie on 8.  Very aggressive putt there.  Confident with the line?  That thing had some speed on it.
JEFF OVERTON: Yeah.  I was feeling pretty good.  Had a good line on it and just got up there, and it was like let's make sure we don't leave it short because it's uphill.  Gave it a run and she went in.
Q. Fantastic second round there after shooting even yesterday.  Enjoy the afternoon.  Get some great lunch.
JEFF OVERTON: Will do.  Thanks.
