Q.   5‑under 65, watching you come on 18, you sat on the bag shaking your head.   Why were you shaking your head? 
JEFF OVERTON:   I had it going pretty good, and had a hybrid in there on the last hole.   Had a little mud on it but still, no excuse, and just kind of didn't make birdie.   Would have been nice to have had a birdie, but played well. 
And the golf course, I don't think I've ever seen it play this easy as far as conditions goes.   It's soft, and there's not much wind.   So it was really there for the taking this morning.   I'm glad I was able to get a little ground back. 

Q.   You played in the afternoon yesterday, shot 1‑over, and it was lift, clean and place; playing the ball down in the morning and shooting 5‑under.   What were the differences? 
JEFF OVERTON:   Yesterday I just putted bad.   Today I made everything inside of ten feet, and yesterday, if I make everything inside ten feet, I shoot 3‑ or 4‑under, is the biggest difference.   Chipped it well and got a lot of things going.   It's when you get things going, it's just easier. 

Q.   I've looked at your finish chart, has not been quite the season you envisioned yet.   What's been happening?   What's gone right and what's gone wrong this week?
JEFF OVERTON:   I put in a lot of work in the off‑season and had a little tendonitis in my wrist and kind of struggled.   Had to pull out and never hit it better.   Felt really confident.   I was playing good at Phoenix and had to pull out.   Took a week off to get it healed up and it's feeling good.   And all of a sudden had a bad putting episode at Riviera and took one more week off to let this thing heal up.   Feel good and hopefully keep making putts.
