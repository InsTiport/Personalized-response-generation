Q.   To follow up a 63 on Thursday with a 68, how did you feel out there?
JEFF OVERTON:   Yeah, I hit it really good today.   I felt a lot better today, actually, than I did yesterday.   But the score wasn't quite as good.   I hit two little wedge shots that I made bogey with rather than making birdie with, that normally you would, and basically that's a fourâ€‘shot turnaround.   I had one on the last hole or through the last hole there, but all in all, it was a fun day.   Webb is lighting it up, so I have to get ready to go low tomorrow.

Q.   But you're in position; 27 top 10s in your career.   Of course you've never won.   Does that play on your mind?   Are you thinking about one of these weeks it's going to be my turn? 
JEFF OVERTON:   You know, that's the goal.   I want to get one, at least one sometime, and maybe some more.   But the whole emphasis is on the first one now.   But yeah, it's going to happen.   I think it's just going to be one of those things that happens whenever you play good and a bunch of putts go in.

Q.   You love playing in the fall. 
JEFF OVERTON:   Yep, absolutely.
