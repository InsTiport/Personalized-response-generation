Q.  Can you explain what happened?
DAVID RICKMAN:  Well, my understanding and what's been
explained is that Martin hit his tee shot in the rough.  He then
looked to identify that by just gently parting the grass on that
occasion.  That was fine.  He then hit a second shot, also stayed
in the rough.  And on that second occasion he marked the position
of the ball and touched it and just moved it ever so slightly.
This is now a situation, by putting his hand on the ball, this is
a situation covered by Rule 12-2, which requires the player to
announce to his fellow competitor, before getting his hand on the
ball, either to move it slightly or to lift it, in either of those
circumstances, and he didn't do that.
Obviously this week we've also got a walking referee and
an observer.  Those two individuals would also have qualified as
somebody to make that announcement, but I'm afraid by not doing
that, it's a breach of Rule 12-2 and it's a one-stroke --
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DAVID RICKMAN:  Well, I believe he maybe said it to the
ball spotter, who was in closest vicinity.  But the rule is very
specific.  It needs to be the fellow competitor, the fellow
competitor is there to protect the interests of the rest of the
field, and therefore, we are specific about who that needs to be.
Because you need to give that fellow competitor, or as I say this
week, the referee, the opportunity to come over and observe the
player's actions.  That's the protection that the rule gives.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DAVID RICKMAN:  The ball spotter saw that this was
happening.  The referee also saw a tee, on this occasion, a tee
coming up and down, and that, of itself, indicated that perhaps
there had been more than just the parting of the grass, I'm
afraid.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
DAVID RICKMAN:  I don't believe it was a spectator, no.
