 Q. How would you assess your play today?
 TITIYA PLUCKSATAPORN: I tried to play fairway, green and put. Yeah, I tried to hit as many greens as I can and make a putt.

 Q. How did you approach the mental side to the game? 
 TITIYA PLUCKSATAPORN: I speak to my sister yesterday and she said to me I had to leave my brain at home and then don't think too much. Think about only the target and make the commitment with myself that I can trust my swing and just roll it in the hole. That's all I speak to her (about) yesterday. 

 Q. And it seems to have worked; right? 
 TITIYA PLUCKSATAPORN: Yes, it worked today. 

 Q. So what's your goal now for this tournament?
 TITIYA PLUCKSATAPORN: So I try to finish in the Top-10. 

 Q. How do you like this golf course? 
 TITIYA PLUCKSATAPORN: It's very, very nice condition. I really like the green. The green is very fast and then you just have to roll the ball and read the good line, and it's very, very nice greens.

 Q. And how do you assess the year? 
 TITIYA PLUCKSATAPORN: I try to finish Top-30 this year, but I don't know, it's still.

 Q. Just outside the Top-30 at the moment. So this could be a good week for you?
 TITIYA PLUCKSATAPORN: Yes, hopefully. 

 Q. But you're not thinking about it too much?
 TITIYA PLUCKSATAPORN: I'll try.
