STEWART McDOUGALL:  Ladies and gentlemen, Eric Ramsay, 4 under par, 68, currently sharing second place in The Open Championship.

Eric, when you came to The Open, did you ever think you'd be in this position after the first round?
ERIC RAMSAY:  Definitely not.  I was just trying to hopefully come and enjoy it and see how I played.
Q.  If you manage to win the silver medal, will it make up for missing out on the Walker Cup?
ERIC RAMSAY:  It would be a nice bonus.
Q.  How did the galleries compare with regionals at Renfrew?
ERIC RAMSAY:  A little different.  There was no one at Renfrew.
Q.  And what about leading the links on Sunday?  Did you enjoy that?
ERIC RAMSAY:  I've been quite lucky.  I've been leading quite a lot.
Q.  Coming from Carnoustie, does that help as well?
ERIC RAMSAY:  I think so, somewhat similar conditions.
Q.  How do you approach tomorrow?
ERIC RAMSAY:  I'm just going to go out and just enjoy it, really not expecting too much, just see how I play.
Q.  How much have you played The Old Course?
ERIC RAMSAY:  Probably between 20, 25 rounds, maybe.
Q.  Have you scored lower than this?
ERIC RAMSAY:  No.
Q.  What was your previous low?
ERIC RAMSAY:  70.
Q.  So what was different about today that brought the best out of you?
ERIC RAMSAY:  I was just out there, just relaxed, just having fun.  I wasn't really thinking too much of my scoring.  I holed a couple of nice putts near the end.
Q.  How do you manage to stay relaxed when it's The Open and everything going on roundabout?
ERIC RAMSAY:  Just try to enjoy it.
Q.  Were they not supposed to have made the course tougher for you guys rather than a bit easier?
ERIC RAMSAY:  I've played here a lot in British Amateur and standard links.  Apart from the tees, it's pretty much the same thing.
Q.  Did you speak with Stuart Wilson before you came?
ERIC RAMSAY:  I haven't spoken to him.
Q.  When you were in Australia this year, were the conditions somewhat    this course is quite fast, was it similar when you won there last year?
ERIC RAMSAY:  Yeah, it was quite a lot warmer this year, but same sort of condition.  Hard to run fairways.
Q.  Under those conditions, you like playing it?
ERIC RAMSAY:  Yes, that's what I like.
Q.  How nervous were you before the round, this morning and last night?
ERIC RAMSAY:  Wasn't too bad.  I was quite nervous when I came here Monday and saw all the stars on the practice ground.
Q.  Playing with two Ryder Cup players, were they good to play with?
ERIC RAMSAY:  Right.  Very encouraging, and always said "good shot."
Q.  Did you look at the leaderboard much?
ERIC RAMSAY:  I didn't really see it until the last fairway, so it was quite good.
Q.  Do you have a lot of friends and family with you?
ERIC RAMSAY:  There's quite a few people today.  I think more people are coming tomorrow.  A lot of friends are off work tomorrow.
Q.  Nice to finish with a birdie?
ERIC RAMSAY:  I would have been happy with par, but birdie was nice.
Q.  Have you played in many professional events so far?
ERIC RAMSAY:  No, only a Challenge Tour event last year.
Q.  Where was that?
ERIC RAMSAY:  In Wales.
Q.  Are you going for your card this year?
ERIC RAMSAY:  In September.

Q.  Did you have a trade or a profession originally?
ERIC RAMSAY:  No, I was at university for a year or so, but that was about it.
Q.  Can you actually live on your Lottery money to make ends meet?
ERIC RAMSAY:  It just pays for your expenses for all the tournaments and that.  My mom and dad help me with the rest.
Q.  Besides today's score, what's the best thing that's happened to you this week?
