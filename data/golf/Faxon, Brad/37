Q.  Just talk about your match?
BRAD FAXON:   Well, it was a tough match.  Adam is a good player and hits it a long way.  Conditions were so different today; it was almost like playing a different course.  But I played well, especially towards the end.  I birdied the last three holes of the match.  So, it was awfully nice. 
I had a big putt on 15 to tie him.  He had already hit it in there for birdie and I made about a 7- or 8-footer that kept me 2-up with three to go.  So that was nice.
