 BRAD FAXON:  No, I think I birdied it each day, but I didn't win it each time.  I think yesterday Scott birdied.

Q.  The birdie on 3 --?
BRAD FAXON:   He got a real bad read.  Did you see that chip shot?  I don't know that it would have made a difference, but he got unlucky there.  I played well today.  Good irons, putted well.  Good combination.

Q.  Do you know anything about 17 and 18?
BRAD FAXON:  I went out and played them after the first day.  I went back and played the last six.  I don't care if I don't see them. 
Putted well.  I hit it close.  I think my iron game has been the best thing this week.  Felt good in my swing.  I had a new set of irons last week, 690 -- just swinging really good.
