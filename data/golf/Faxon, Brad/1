 Q.   A battle today?   
BRAD FAXON:   It was.   I got off to a good start.   I just wasn't as crisp maybe with irons.   I missed a few greens.   Tough up‑and‑downs.   It was firmer and faster a little bit on the back nine especially when we finished, the front nine on the course.   
But I played okay, I bogeyed the two par‑5s with some silly bogeys, which they always are.   I don't know, is 4‑under leading?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
BRAD FAXON:   Well, that will make me sick for a little while, but I'll get over it.   But there weren't a lot of birdies out there, that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   Hard pins?  
BRAD FAXON:   Hard pins, yeah.   Even with short shots, some of these little nooks and crannies, you know.  
   
 Q.   What is your mentality now heading into the weekend only a few shots back?  
BRAD FAXON:   Actually, good.   I'm a little angry right now, because I had a chance to reach the par‑5 9th in two, but I didn't.   But, yeah, I'm in pretty good shape.   I just got to cool down for a second.   
But I'm three shots back, going into a Major, there's a lot of golf to be played.
