  Q.  Five inches away from making two more birdies on the last couple of holes?   
 BRAD FAXON: I had a beautiful putt on 17 and 18, actually.  I made some nice putts today.  I love when you have to stay in your crouch after you hit a putt and you know it's got a chance.  That's a good feeling.   
  
  Q.  Do you have some good memories on that 18th hole?   
 BRAD FAXON:  I hit the same club, actually hit it a little too far, but I'm not complaining about anything.   
  
  Q.  How much does it help a guy, when you feel like your play hasn't been up to par, and you come back to a place you've played well, does that give you a boost?   
 BRAD FAXON:  It can give you a boost, but I don't think it necessarily means a whole lot.  You can have good memories if you use them the right way.  I didn't play here -- played well here last year.  If you want to go with that theory, that you play good on courses you play well at, I've played great on courses, but I've played badly on courses I've played well on a lot.  I don't have any pattern.  I wish I did.   
  
  Q.  It's a busy week for you with your tournament earlier this week, played the Pro-Am yesterday.  Kind of hectic.  Did you feel this coming on today?   
 BRAD FAXON: Well, I played with Zach Johnson as my partner at CVS.  We had a great time.  We had a putt to win or tie for the lead on the last hole.  So that's nice, getting into competition, going through your routine, picturing shots and stuff like that.  And then I was paired with him here, so that was nice.  I was very comfortable playing with him.  Things worked out pretty good.  Have a great week.
