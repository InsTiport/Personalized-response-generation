Q.  The wind picked up obviously in the afternoon, but at 5 under you've got to be happy with that?
BRAD FAXON:  Yeah, I double bogeyed the first hole today, then bogeyed the second hole, No. 11, which was probably as bad a start as you want out here, but hung in there, made one par on the front nine and made four birdies on the back to bring it back nicely.
Q.  I guess good to see, too, that the leaders from yesterday didn't take off and separate themselves?
BRAD FAXON:  Well, it's tough out here.  You know, you can see the wind has picked up.  If anything, this afternoon the wind has been very steady.  It's hard to get the ball close.  It's hard to make birdies.  I'm really very happy.
Q.  Players Championship is moving to May.  I guess that will help these type conditions?
BRAD FAXON:  Yeah, it might calm the winds down a little bit and give us a firmer, faster golf course, which everybody wants to have.  I think the field staff was nice to us today, they watered the greens a little bit and didn't cut them down like they could have.  I think that was a pretty smart move.
Q.  All in all you like your chances going into the weekend?
BRAD FAXON:  I could jump right into the hunt.
