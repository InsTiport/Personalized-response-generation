Q. A round of 71, how did you find it out there today?
SCOTT McCARRON: I played okay most of the day.  I had it 3-under going into 16.  Didn't really do much.  Birdied the first hole and birdied the two par 5s on the back.  Nothing else real special.  And then unfortunately bogeyed 16, which is one of the toughest par 3s in all of golf.  Hit it in the burn on 18 and actually made a nice five there.
It was kind of a poor finish, but all in all, not a bad day.
Q. How will you prepare for the final round?
SCOTT McCARRON: Again, I'm just going to go hit a few balls, get my neck worked on which has been bothering me all week and hopefully get some good sleep.  Be able to sleep in, because I'll have a late tee time.  I know I'm chasing Miguel; Miguel is a great player and a very good frontrunner.  He will be very difficult to catch.  I'm hoping the weather turns nasty tomorrow and maybe gives us a chance.
Q. Is this a course where you prefer to be a chaser rather than the leader?
SCOTT McCARRON: Well, I'd always rather be the leader.  Always rather be in front, because then you have everybody else chasing you.  Miguel is in a good position.  I'm five back of him, so I'm going to have to play some really good golf tomorrow to catch him.
