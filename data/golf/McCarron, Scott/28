 Q. Just get some quotes about the round today and something about the course. That'll be good to hear.
 SCOTT McCARRON: Well, I thought I played pretty solid. The wind was picking up just enough to make you guess a little bit. Had a lot of opportunities for birdies coming down the stretch. Made a couple and left a couple on the lips. I'm happy. I'm 5-under and in a good position. 
 The golf course is really in good shape. It's starting to firm up a little bit in the fairways; you're starting to get a little bit more roll. The greens are really fast. I would expect to see some low scores this afternoon.

 Q. You learning something about time management in week?
 SCOTT McCARRON: I've learned a lot about time management. You know, soon as I tee'd it up Thursday yesterday, then it was normal, back to normal. 
 Certainly we had a lot of things going on the first couple days. Things are going good.
