  Q. Scott, 7-under through two rounds. Nice position; nice playing.   
 SCOTT McCARRON: Yeah, I played really well today. I really enjoy this golf course. A lot of fun. You know, you get a lot of short irons in your hands. It's very tricky to hit the ball close.  
 So really enjoy it. Beautiful day out here at the Greenbrier.  
  
  Q. What's the gallery like out there?   
 SCOTT McCARRON: Yeah, the galleries have been fantastic. I'm glad to see we've got big galleries out here this week. We had big galleries just on a Monday when I came out here for the Pro-Am. So glad to see people come out and support the tournament.   
  
  Q. How is the course playing different today than yesterday, or is it hole to hole?  
 SCOTT McCARRON: I think it's pretty much the same. You know, we had a little delay yesterday but didn't rain. The golf course is still very soft, so it's playing about as long as it can.   
 The greens are holding up nice. I think it's in beautiful condition.  
  
  Q. Some of the golfers are talking about they didn't know what to expect coming here, and this kind of exceeded their expectations. Can you talk about that?  
 SCOTT McCARRON: I've always heard about the Greenbrier and what a beautiful place it was, but I'm really impressed with this golf course. You get the CB McDonald/ Seth Raynor redan greens, a lot of different looks, square greens, square bunkering, which is unusual. It's something that I wish we played more of.
