 Q. Talk about battling all day and the roller coaster on the front nine?
 SCOTT McCARRON: I notice any time I get into the wind left-to-right, it's difficult for me because I'm kind of a cutter. So I missed a couple of shots right, a little disappointing.
 I came back and hit a lot of good shots, and putted well, today. Kept me in play. 

 Q. You're still tied for third. 
 SCOTT McCARRON: Yeah, I have a chance to have a good tournament. Phil shot 62 and that's a great round of golf today and my hat is off to him. Tomorrow I have to go out there and see if I can make a lot of birdies.
