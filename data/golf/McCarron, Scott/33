  Q. How did you play?  
 SCOTT McCARRON: I tell you what, 6:50 was a little early for me to tee off. I had to wake up at 4:15 or so. I think I was still asleep the first couple holes till I finally woke up.   
 But I played pretty solid out there. I'm happy and proud of myself that I made a nice comeback today.   
  
  Q. You really did. You got it going, and no more bogeys after those first two, and I just watched the last couple of holes, but it looked like you were solid.   
 SCOTT McCARRON: Yeah, I was pretty solid all day. I even missed a couple of short putts for birdie. Could have been even better, but I'm very happy with the way -- my position right now. Could have been a lot better, but I'm happy I at least made the cut.   
  
  Q. You and Jay both use the long putter. Is there any advantage for either of you when you get to play together to see it, just to see that much more of it?  
 SCOTT McCARRON: You know, not so much. The only thing I'm looking for is the ball rolling. I don't care if it's long putter, cross-handed, belly putter or whatever. I'm just watching the ball roll. I'm not watching the guy stroke, so Jay rolled it really well the last couple of days, so it's nice watching his ball roll in the hole.   
  
  Q. You rolled it pretty well, too. And hit 14 greens today.   
 SCOTT McCARRON: Yeah, I hit a lot of greens today, which was good, and yesterday even though I only hit maybe nine or something like that, I missed like four or five of them by like an inch or two, so I'm hitting the ball really well.  
  
  Q. Anything you need to do differently this weekend?  
 SCOTT McCARRON: Make more birdies, obviously. You got Justin Rose up there. Probably be a lot of good scores in the afternoon, so I gotta make a ton of birdies.  
  
  Q. Go get 'em.   
 SCOTT McCARRON: Thanks. Appreciate it.
