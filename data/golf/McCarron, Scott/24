  Q. Four straight birdies. That's pretty sweet.  
 SCOTT MCCARRON: Yeah. It feels good. I played very solid today. I was very patient. A couple under. Then I birdied 12. And, again, it was when am I going to start making the putts? Left a lot putts short out there. Our scorekeeper said, "If you made any putts today, you'll be leading this thing."   
  
  Q. On 18, it's a tough putt you had. It's going to go past the hole unless it hits the hole and it did.  
 SCOTT MCCARRON: It's a very fast putt. That ball got above the pin. I was kind of hoping it would come back but it didn't. I read it absolutely beautifully. I was able to make it.  
  
  Q. I was here in 2008 when you finished 2nd. It's like deja vu all over again.  
 SCOTT MCCARRON: Obviously The Playoffs start next week but for me this is a playoff. I don't play well, then I'm going home. I'm coming out here and basically saying this is five playoffs for me, tournaments, so I got to play well tomorrow.  
  
  Q. I know you're excited but you've been here before. How will you handle tomorrow?  
 SCOTT MCCARRON: Just like I did today. We always say stay one shot at a time. Really do a lot of breathing and get out there and just trust it and let it go.  
  
  Q. Great playing.  
 SCOTT MCCARRON: Thank you.
