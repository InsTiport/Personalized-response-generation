  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Tournament Host Scott McCarron here at the Reno‑Tahoe Open.   Nine points into the weekend with you.   First time playing here under the modified Stableford format, if I'm not incorrect.
SCOTT McCARRON:   Yeah, I didn't play last year.

Q.   But you've had experience obviously with the international and the format.   So all that being said, just some comments through two days here. 
SCOTT McCARRON:   Well, I certainly like the format.   I make a bunch of bogeys, made a couple of double bogeys.   At least had an opportunity to make some birdies, get them back. 
I'm happy to at least make the weekend, haven't played on the weekend in a long time and host the tournament and all the extracurricular activities I have to do this week, hosting pairing parties, sponsor parties and players party.
And I haven't got a lot of rest, I need a haircut, don't have time for a haircut.   But at least I get to play on the weekend, so I'm happy about that.

Q.   How does that add‑‑ with what you just said, how does all of that attack your mindset, or does it in a way help you kind of streamline things?
SCOTT McCARRON:   I don't know if it helps.   But certainly I've done it four or five years now hosting.   And before that I was kind of an unofficial host where I was still going and doing some of these parties. 
So you try to compartmentalize and get the stuff you gotta get done at that time and not worry about the other stuff.   I'm out there playing, I can't think about what I'm going to say at the Pro‑Am pairings party or serving at dinner tonight.
I've gotten pretty good at it.   And so I enjoy it.   I enjoy it.   But definitely is a very busy week for me.

Q.   What do you make of this field, Scott, it's always hard to kind of judge because you've got a variety of guys but what do you make of this field compared to past?
SCOTT McCARRON:   I think it's the best field we've ever had.   We've got Padraig Harrington and Davis Love.   We've got I don't know how many major winners, 11 major winners.   I definitely think this is the best field we've ever had. 
Guys are running out of events before the FedExCup.   So we've got a lot of guys playing this year.
I think it's helped our field out quite a bit.   The word's out.   Guys like this golf course.   Guys really seem to like the Stableford system. 
A lot of us played the international back in the day and love that type of format.   It's different.   It's not like every single week, week in, week out.   So the guys like coming here for it.

Q.   Does word of mouth continue to travel, early on that was your best weapon around here was other guys talking to guys; is that still the case or is it more?
SCOTT McCARRON:   I think so.   I think definitely word of mouth, guys that love the golf course, it shows so well on TV, if anybody catches any of the highlights.
It looks like one of the most beautiful golf courses we'll play all year.   But I think what really did it when we brought the milk shakes over here, that was really the thing that did it.

Q.   Have you had one?
SCOTT McCARRON:   I'm lactose intolerant, but I'm going to have one later today.

Q.   If you could go back on your injury a little bit.   I know you had the one elbow surgery.   Did you have surgery on both?
             SCOTT McCARRON:   I didn't have surgery on the left one.   Had surgery on the right one.   They repaired the radialis brevis tendon tendon.   It was torn off the bone.   They had to reattach it. 
             The left one was getting bad.   I did a PRP injection where they do the blood spinning, shoot it back in there.   That seemed to help quite a bit.   I haven't had any problems with that.   That was about two years ago. 
             And I've had surgery on my left thumb, had a bone spur removed where they had to detach ligaments and tendons, take the spur out and then reattach them.   That's been a tough one.   Just that left thumb is very critical in a golf swing for a right‑handed golfer.

Q.   Do you feel with this week, making a weekend, your last night at Canada was pretty solid, do you feel like you're back to where you need to be?
SCOTT McCARRON:   No, I'm not back where I need to be.   But I'm certainly moving in the right direction finally.   It's been a very difficult year.   I still was in a lot of pain the start of the year.   I would say over the last couple of months I've been able to swing without pain, which is good.   But I'm only playing one tournament a month or one every month and a half. 
I'm not getting any events because of my nonexempt major medical.   This year being a short season was a really bad year to be on a medical.   And it was just unfortunate.   I've only played seven events or something like that through August.   So that's not very many. 
It's tough to get any momentum going when you're only playing once a month.   So I haven't even come close to making a cut really all year. 
Last week I got a last‑minute call from Bill Paul the tournament director at the Canadian Open.   Got in.   Missed the cut by a shot. 
So for me that was a positive step in the right direction.   Even though I missed the cut, it was the best I've ever felt missing a cut, honestly.   It's been a year and a half, two years.
So to come here, make the cut while hosting, I'm very happy.   I'm disappointed in the way I played today in my round and my finish.   But I'm still happy I made the cut, got a chance to play two more days.

Q.   Can you imagine at any point in your career thinking that you would go two years without making a cut?
SCOTT McCARRON:   Well, it hasn't been quite two years.   It's been Bay Hill.   Absolutely not.   It's just one of those things, when injuries come up, you never know. 
I mean, so many guys have been derailed by injuries and it's tough to come back from an injury.   The players out here are so good.   And a lot of us play too long with injury and come back too early, which I've now done twice where I probably should have stopped way before and not come back the start of this year, I should have waited until I felt healthy. 
When you do that, you put yourself behind the eight ball.   And I've done it twice in my career now.

Q.   And then you've got this and Wyndham.   Are you planning on playing in the Wyndham championship?
SCOTT McCARRON:   I would like to play Wyndham.   As of this morning or last night I was fourth alternate.   So I'm not in right now. 
That's an event where you will have a lot of withdrawals because once guys are locked into the FedExCup, they will take a week off so they don't have to play so many weeks in a row.
So I'm hoping for a lot of withdrawals.   If not, I'm hoping for a sponsor invite.   I finished second there one year.   Played in the final group the following year when Arjun Atwal.   It's a course I like.   But I've got my work cut out for me this weekend.

Q.   Will you play in the WEB.COM champion?
SCOTT McCARRON:   Yes, I'll play in that tour school for the PGA TOUR, those four tournaments, I've signed up for them and am going to play.

Q.   And then you're about a little less than two years from 50, do you want to play in the Champions Tour, do you want to do the commentating?
SCOTT McCARRON:   I enjoy the commentating, been fortunate enough to work for Golf Channel the last year and a half.   Jack Graham hired me to do quite a few events last year and I'll do probably ten or 11 events for him this year. 
I really enjoy it.   But I still want to play a little bit.   And tournaments I'm getting in, I would like to play.   A lot of the events I do for Golf Channel are world golf championships or events that I wasn't going to get in this year anyways. 
But I've really enjoyed my time there.   And it's taught me a lot, and I've learned a lot not only on the commentating side but also on the playing side being on course and watching the best players in the world when they're playing their best has been a lot of fun for me.

Q.   Given you haven't got a chance to play as you were saying, are you surprised at how well or to be playing in a weekend or pleasantly pleased how would you define?
SCOTT McCARRON:   Not surprised.   I played pretty good yesterday.   I had eight points and still left quite a few out there.   Today I made some mistakes and then had three 3‑putts on my last nine holes which stings a little bit and 3‑putted the last whole which is no fun. 
But I'm not surprised.   I could see my game starting to come around a little bit in Canada.   And so when I came here, it's a golf course I like, this was my home course when I lived here.   Love MontrÃªux.   I've got a lot of local knowledge here, even though I've forgotten quite a bit of it since it's been a couple of years and I'm getting a little older.
But I got off to a pretty good start yesterday and I want to continue.   I felt like I could compete this week and so I put myself behind the eight ball here after today's round.

Q.   Can you talk about just the difference between conditions from yesterday and today?
SCOTT McCARRON:   Yeah, yesterday we kind of got the short end of the straw yesterday because yesterday was very difficult conditions.   Wind was swirling, tough to pick clubs.
And today was absolutely perfect conditions, I thought.   Just a hint of a breeze at times.   It's as easy as can you have it here at MontrÃªux, golf course in beautiful shape no wind beautiful day, I think guys will go really low today.   I played with Rod Pampling.   He had 17 points today.

Q.   Is there room on the schedule for another Stableford tournament during the season?
SCOTT McCARRON:   Is there room on the schedule for another Stableford?   I don't believe so.   I think that's one of the things that makes us unique.   I don't think any other tournament is going to go to Stableford.   Guys certainly enjoy it.   It's fun we get to do it at least once a year. 
But I don't think there's going to be another tournament going to Stableford.   If they did, I'd call them a copy cat.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
