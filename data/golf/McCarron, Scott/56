 Q.  What happened after 10?
SCOTT MCCARRON:   I played really well the front side.  Didn't miss a shot, didn't miss a fairway or green.  And, you know, I played okay, I shot 1-under and Tom played really well.  He left the door open on 10 for me.  He hit it into the right rough underneath the tree; and had kind of a restricted backswing and hit it in the water and I think that was the turning point in the match.  I started believing that I could start winning some holes.  I guess I was the closer today.

Q.  You had the blade working pretty well, too. 
SCOTT MCCARRON:   Made some real good putts today.  The greens are starting to smooth out a little bit.  They are starting to firm up a little bit.  I just really hit some great shots coming down the stretch today and made some real good putts.

Q.  You said you were the closer  -- you were more of a starting pitcher, but it looks like you had the closing  --?
SCOTT MCCARRON:   Yeah, I had the closing job today.  You never know in match-play.  I thought it was probably good for me to be down in the match in the first nine holes because I continued to be aggressive.  I was not holding onto anything.  I was just really being aggressive the back nine, and that was a lot of fun.

Q.  Is the cup getting bigger for you?
SCOTT MCCARRON:   I tell you, I am starting to putt so good right now, and it's just perfect timing.

Q.  It looks like you are going to play Azinger in the next round. 
SCOTT MCCARRON:   Great.  Paul has been kind of my mentor over the last few years.  He is a great guy and has really taught me a lot about playing here on the PGA TOUR.  He's a wonderful family man and he's been doing this a long time.  Any time Paul talks, I listen.
