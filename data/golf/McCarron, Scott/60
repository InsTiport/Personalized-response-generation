SCOTT McCARRON:   It was a good match.  Colin played real solid.  He only made one birdie, but he didn't make any bogeys.  He didn't make any all day long, which kind of forced me to make some birdies. 
And I hit a couple loose shots, and didn't putt that well, but, you know, I had a great, great shot at the par  3; made a hole-in-one.  That was something I'll never forget.  And Colin knocked it about a foot and a half. 
Then I hit a good shot the next hole, really good shot the next hole about three feet, and missed it.  And again, a good shot on 17, so it was a great finish. 

Q.   What was the turning point in your match?
SCOTT McCARRON:   I think the turning point probably was making hole-in-one.  The match was all-square at the time.  I had never been up in the match.  Making that hole-in-one was probably the turning point.

Q.   And talk about, you're going to play the winner of Mike Weir  --
   SCOTT McCARRON:   Looking forward to playing Mike Weir.  We have known each other for a long time.  We battled it out for the Canadian qualifying years ago at Morning Star up on Victoria Island.  He's a great guy and a really good player and I'm looking forward to playing against him tomorrow.
