  Q. Par 5 on the back nine. Looked like you tweaked your shoulder on that rough?  
 SCOTT McCARRON: No, I tweaked it last night. It was bad, bad this morning. I came early and had treatment on it. It was still bad. It was bad all day, I guess.   
 It was okay the first, made five or six holes, then it started really hurting the backside. It showed in my swing. I wasn't able to swing through it.   
 Jim was out there, and I had him, he popped me right before we got to the green on the par 5. What he did kind of helped it. Made some good swings. Bogeyed the next hole, made two good swings and played all right from there.   
  
  Q. I know you're working on your swing. You missed a lot of shots long and left?  
 SCOTT McCARRON: The only reason I missed those shots long and left is I couldn't swing. I'd get to the top and my neck would grab me. I hit it great all week. Today the only reason I played the way I did is my neck was out.  
  
  Q. Let's talk positive then; your first top 5 finish. How does it feel?   
 SCOTT McCARRON: It's my first top 5 in this year. I was out for two years. So that doesn't really count. But thanks for pointing that out.   
 No, it's good. It was a good, solid week. I'd like to have played better. Like to have been healthier today and give it a go. But it just wasn't meant to be.  
  
  Q. Good to see you back. Your game is coming around, you've got to feel good about that?  
 SCOTT McCARRON: I'm going to my hometown next week. The Reno Tahoe Open, sponsored by RED Development. So I'm looking forward to getting there.
