 Q. Not the finish I know you were looking for, but otherwise 2-under par, 73, solid day out there. 
 SCOTT McCARRON: You know, I didn't play all that well, but 2-under is an okay score. It was a little tricky out there. The pins were tucked and tough to get to. Obviously not happy with the way I finished. 
 I've been wanting that cart path removed for years. As the host that, cart path is gonna be removed next year. That's all.
