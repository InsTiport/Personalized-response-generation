 Q.  Any other time when someone's not shooting 7-under, 3-under on a day like this, how do you feel?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I didn't shoot 3-under, sorry.   
 Q.  3-over, sorry.  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah.  Yeah, not great.  Things would have (indiscernible).  Saw the play go right, kept the ball in play all the time and gave myself some decent opportunities for birdies, and didn't take advantage of them today and -- but, yeah, 7-under is a great score, obviously.  It's a really, really tough course.  So he's obviously played really well and (indiscernible).   
 Q.  You managed to be one of the few that actually handled 10 well.  How did you do that?  No. 10 seemed to get a lot of people today.  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, two great shots, good drive and a good 3-iron to 12, 15 feet and straight uphill, left of the shoulder, and then in the middle.  A little bit of the story of the day.  I thought I had some good opportunities for birdie, didn't take them.  So that's how it is sometimes.   
 Q.  What's it going to take to get them tomorrow?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Well, we'll definitely have some smoother greens.  But the green gets a little bit bumpy in the afternoon.  So hopefully I can take advantage of that tomorrow.
