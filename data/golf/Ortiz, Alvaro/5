Q. The fact that you're a few shots off the lead and you're competing against the best golfers in the world, what does that mean to you?
ALVARO ORTIZ: Oh, it means the world. Just to have the chance to come out here and compete against the best and being toe‑by‑toe by the names like Tiger Woods or Bernhard Langer, I played with him, and it's just special to me and to my family and I was just so honored that I had the opportunity to do it.

Q. The lead is at 4‑under now, so what is it going to take for you to make up ground and kind of catch up with the leaders tomorrow?
ALVARO ORTIZ: Well for sure take advantage of the early round tomorrow. I think the weather's not going to hold up, it might rain, hopefully it won't, but you never know. 
If it rains and it starts getting a little cold it can play really tough and we might not even get to double digits, the winning score. 
So you never know, but I'm just going to try to go out there tomorrow and post a red number and get a good feelings for the weekend.
