 Q. How do you feel about your round today? You had a little bit of trouble on the front but was able to do some things on the back nine.   
ALVARO ORTIZ: Yeah, it was a good round, I had a lot of good things, I did a lot of positive things, I hit the ball well, I hit way better than I did Thursday and Friday, for sure and I just couldn't get anything out of it.   
The front nine was just tough. I didn't putt great, I had my chances, I just didn't take them. I hit a bunch of good shots in there.  
And then going into the back nine I hit so many quality shots, I got some momentum going and then I just, at the end I think I got a little frustrated with a couple shots that, you know, that didn't end up the way I wanted. And maybe like the one on 16 and to 17, I made both great swings and I had 50‑footers, 60‑footers for birdie, which it happens out here, you know, it's just a tough course, tough challenge.   
But I think tomorrow will be a great day and just have to take the good positives things that did I today into tomorrow and maybe a 64 or 65 I can post it up there on the leaderboard.  
   
 Q. Were you happy to finally be out there today without any rain or wind or any adverse conditions like that?  
ALVARO ORTIZ: Yeah, for sure. I just, I think it's a little bit why I'm a little mad about my round today, it's just, it was perfect conditions, I've been putting so well and my ball striking has been a little bit off and today it was just completely on and I was hitting the shots like I wanted them and in spots where I wanted it and just the putting wasn't there. And I made a couple silly bogeys and in the blink of an eye I was already 3‑over.   
And I was happy I got it back a little bit and I got it in a good position to win the low amateur tomorrow, but hopefully I can get something going in the 60s tomorrow.
