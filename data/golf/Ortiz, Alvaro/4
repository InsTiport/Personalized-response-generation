Q. What does it mean to you to make the cut here?
ALVARO ORTIZ: Oh, man, it means the world. I came out here with a mentality of, I want the Green Jacket and everything, but at some point in the round today I thought it was getting out of hand and I thought I was losing my game and I wasn't going to be able to make the cut. 
But I found something on 14 and gladly I hit that great shot on 14 and 15 and on 18 and that 4â€‘under in the last five holes really helped me to get some confidence going for the weekend.

Q. How did you settle yourself down?
ALVARO ORTIZ: Well, I have no idea, to be honest. I was really, not angry, but I was just feeling, you know, doing things quick and maybe I wasn't taking the right time, and at the end of the day I cannot put any excuses of my swing or anything, just, it happens, it's golf and I was just happy that I found it when I needed it and I'm looking forwards for the weekend.
