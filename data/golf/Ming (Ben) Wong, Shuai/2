 Q.  So you went up 1st hole; back to all square.  Kind of back and forth on the front nine.  
BEN WONG: Yeah, back and forth, back and forth.  Tim is a grinder and he's younger, so I think I had a little bit of a distance advantage.  He hung in there really, really well.   
Even when he hit some errant shots he would always make the putt coming back to tie me.  Made it really, really tough for me.   
I got up on -- I mean, I was up going into 9 and he won that hole.  After that, we were kind of just neck in neck all the way up to 14.  I missed a putt on 14, so that put me 1-up.   
So I was just staying patient the whole time.  I knew he was a good putter so I was just staying aggressive.  Birdies can only beat this guy, no matter where he hits it.   
So I stayed patient and got one back on 17.   
18 he had a really clutch up and down.   
I birdied the last hole to win, so, yeah, pretty satisfying.   
 Q.  You've been in the Junior Am five times.  
BEN WONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is this your first round of 16?  
BEN WONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  How does that feel?  Not much time to enjoy, but how does it feel?  
BEN WONG: It feels great.  I know that I have two matches and I've thought about if kind of all day, that I have a seconds match after this.   
I was confident in myself I was going to win the first match, but actually it was harder than I thought.   
After I did so, it was pretty relieving.   
 Q.  Going into the round of 8 in a little bit, what's your mindset going into that?  
BEN WONG: Same thing:  Just be myself.  Yeah.
