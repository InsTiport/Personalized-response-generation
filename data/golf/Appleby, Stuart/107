Q.
Just a general comment about your round.
STUART APPLEBY:  I got off to a pretty slow start, didn't make any mistakes.  Didn't make any birdies early on and turned at 1-under par so it was a bit of a sneaky, slow nine holes.  The second nine, would have been the front nine, was much more improved.

I holed a trap shot on 7, actually really didn't have much of a chance at getting it really close, ended up throwing it into the hole on the fly, so that was a bit of a break of good fortune.

And then messed up a good chance on 8 for birdie there and happened to chip in off the back left-hand side of nine.

But that nine holes was solid.  I have just taken a month off and hadn't played since the NEC Invitational, and that was a good round of golf considering I was pretty rusty, but I liked the way I was playing.
Q.  So you weren't surprised at all?
STUART APPLEBY:  You wouldn't think if you're a top 20 player in the world you shouldn't be surprised by shooting 5-under, otherwise you're going in with pretty negative feelings.  I would say that was a good start.  I'm not surprised.  I would have been more surprised if I'd have shot 5 over.  It would have been more that way.  A good start, nice feeling going into the rest of the week.  Now it just depends on what sort of weather we're going to get in the next few days, which I hear tomorrow could be potentially bad.
