  Q.  On his round.   

 STUART APPLEBY:  I got off to a bad start when with a double bogey on No. 1 and then another on No. 12.  It was a tough day, but I enjoyed the day.  I think Zach was emotionally a lot sharper than everyone else.  And I think there was an element of luck involved.   

 Zach knew he had a sharper game today and he knuckled down and got it done.   

 The course was ultimately the beast this week.   

 Zach had the right relationship with the golf course today.
