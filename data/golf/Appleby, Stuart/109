STUART APPLEBY:   I didn't do much wrong out there.  I really screwed up the back nine.  Felt all right all day but Chad just kept making every putt.  I was trying to just ignore that and continue and to do what I needed to do and hit my shots.  It just was a day where I think he played  -- today he played great.  Yesterday he played good and mixed those together  -- yesterday I played great and ordinary together.  I would have had to play pretty good golf.  He just outplayed me, no two ways about it.
Q.  How hard is it to block out how well he played?
STUART APPLEBY:   To a degree, it is difficult.  All day I was trying to focus on what I was doing and my play.  I didn't have the little bits of luck today that I had yesterday in my round and I hit some poor shots.  And playing with Chad for two days, looking back now, I can't even think of a poor shot he hit in two days.  He hardly dropped a shot in two days.  Great golf, great golf.  He made good putts yesterday and made a bunch today, on his behalf, very clean golf.
Q.  Was 9 sort of the turning point you're up three?
STUART APPLEBY:   A little bit, 9 definitely was a turning point.  Didn't hit a great drive.  Thought I hit a really good second shot.  Left myself in a vulnerable position and he holes the putt, and I was like, okay, he's holed his  -- didn't make it.  And then the tide really started to move there and played all right until  -- I thought I hit a better drive down 15 and 17 is diabolical.  Hit a drive down 16.  17, just didn't read the break enough.  And 18, if I didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t hit a branch Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ then ended up making a great double in the end.  Yeah, I would have liked to have pushed it.  Four-shot lead, it's disappointing.  But Chad certainly played great, no doubt about it.
