  Q. Well, one of the better rounds of the afternoon.  
 STUART APPLEBY: Yeah. Didn't get off to a great start. Struggled a little bit early and sort of steadied the ship and hit some good shots and made a couple of putts and just got up and down. Tricky chipping around. Sometimes you miss the green, it's not that much going on. It looks like no big deal, but the lies are difficult, and that's -- next with missing greens here, you're going to struggle. The secret here is hit greens.  
  
  Q. Jeff Overton was 6-under at one point and finished at even par. Get harder in the afternoon?  
 STUART APPLEBY: Probably harder in the afternoon. The greens are receptive, but you've really got to be comfortable on the greens. Otherwise, you start guessing yourself, you get grain involved and the wind and all that, gets very tricky. Anything under par -- if it's like this, anything under par everyday is a good start.  
  
  Q. You like your opportunity to play early in the morning?  
 STUART APPLEBY: Yes.
