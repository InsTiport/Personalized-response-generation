Q.   You never complain where the birdies come from, but five on the back nine has to do wonders for your confidence regardless how today turns out moving forward in the Playoffs?
STUART APPLEBY:   Well, absolutely.   I try to set out every round to have six birdies.   If I had six birdies every round, I would be talking to you a lot but more it doesn't turn out like that that often. 
Today that's what I was thinking.   I got to the back nine and thought, well, six might not be enough.   Then you get back to this is the FedEx and this is the Playoffs; if I could time my performances more like this, it would be nice.   The year has been a bit quiet so it was really nice to get out there today and feel more comfortable.   The nerves, I dealt with them nice, which was great.   It was a great test of golf and it was just nice to roll the ball and make some putts. 

Q.   When you do get yourself in contention, you seem to seal the deal?
STUART APPLEBY:   Well, it's been a long time.   I've won tournaments but they feel so long ago and sometimes that experience can wear thin and sort of doesn't show its head much.   Today I just thought, go out there, don't fight, don't wrestle the golf course.   If you get an opportunity, give it a roll, see what happens. 
Really worked a lot to get my ball flight to take off online, seems quite obvious but I just lost a little awareness of where the ball was taking off, so that was a factor this week.
