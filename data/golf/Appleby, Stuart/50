 Q.  How was that 69 today? 
 STUART APPLEBY:  I played pretty bad all day.  I hit the ball bad.  Didn't really do anything except chip-and-putt.  Putting was the only reason.  I could have easily been over par.  I could have shot four or five over today if I hadn't saved. 
 I think I hit eight greens for the day.  Well, I hit driver onto 10, so sort of nine greens getting in there but chipped and putted well.  Chipped and putted well.  Made some birdies.  Didn't make many birdies today so it was really close.  I easily could have shot 3-over instead of under, easy. 

 Q.  Seems like a lot of real low ones out there -- 
 STUART APPLEBY:  I played worse than what the course played difficult, I think.  I haven't played -- hit it like I did the previous two tournaments.  I'm getting it done but I've got to play better.  Making putts for pars are like dogs that chase cars, don't last long.  If I can shoot under par tomorrow, hopefully it won't be as stressful as the way I did it today. 

 Q.  You're alone at third in the moment? 
 STUART APPLEBY:  Daylight's up front, first and second.  If I can shoot a nice, good round tomorrow, I think, you know, if you shot 4- or 5-under tomorrow, that would be a good score. 
 Now, what's that mean for the tournament; does that threaten the top?  Probably not.  Yeah, I think if you looked at the odds in Vegas, the odds of a couple players winning it, that's about it from here.  It's not really an open tournament.
