STUART APPLEBY:  The fairway is a little firmer, the breeze was definitely up, it kept the ball moving up in the air, and it kept kicking in the rough.  I should know, I spent enough time in the rough last few days.  The greens are very firm, some not actually as firm as others.

I actually didn't notice it until I walked up to 15 tee and was against it.  The wind changed, probably got to the green, played that one out and started to change.  16 and 17, it started to rain out there.  It's pretty grim.  I'm sort of surprised we didn't tee off earlier if we knew this was coming.
Q.  Looking at the leaderboard, did you see where Tiger placed his number?
STUART APPLEBY:  I did see it.
Q.  Players in the locker room have been saying that maybe, since knowing what they knew about the forecast they should have bumped the tee times up a couple of hours.
STUART APPLEBY:  Yeah, I think it was pretty much the forecast we were going to have some thunder late today.  I think we need to have a couple other hours up our sleeves, to wrap it up on Sunday or Monday for viewing.
