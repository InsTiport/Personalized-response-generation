 Q.  Talking about his round. 

 STUART APPLEBY:  I made birdies today and that was the difference, but it was just a really hard day.  This course doesn't let anyone get comfortable.  The greens were unbelievably fast.  This tournament feels like it has so far to go.  Where I am is a good position to be in. 

 Today was a very indifferent round.  The key on the weekend is to be more consistent. 

 To have any success, you've got to learn to somehow relax here. 

  "You are going into a bout with a heck of an opponent."  

  "You have to punch and jab and be light on your feet or this place will knock you the heck out."
