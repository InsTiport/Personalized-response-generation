STUART APPLEBY:  Yesterday and today, I managed to get the ball rolling.  I would have liked to have taken day one back, but you can't.  I got off to a great start last year and that turned out to be a win and that was nice.
Q.  The challenge of putting on these greens that are slow grainy and slow, can you talk about that?
STUART APPLEBY:  It's tricky because the whole property is one massive slope.  Flying in, you see the lie of the land, it's just one big slope and the whole course, running across it and down it and you still have to try and get the read of the grain correct and the winds can be coming from the north or south.  Once you get those things sorted out in the practice rounds, you can get a good feel.
Q.  With the early tee times tomorrow, you're having trouble with sciatica and you've been stretching, an early tee time, is that going to be any trouble?
STUART APPLEBY:  I'm feeling better.  I made an improvement yesterday and last night.  I woke up today in a lot better shape than I've been for weeks, so I think I'm really over the hill now in getting back on track.  Stretching is making a massive difference.  I think getting an early start two or three days ago, it would have been tough.
