   STUART APPLEBY: You've got to drive the ball well around here, and I drove it poorly both two rounds today. That just left me too much guessing on yardages. I hit some good shots, though. I could have got away with some average driving and some putting but just seemed to hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in, and then when I had a good chance, I messed that up.   
 I left a lot of shots out there and certainly should have been in contention more than that. Bottom line is if you don't hit the fairway, you're not going to have a decent shot in.
