   STUART APPLEBY:  Working in the right direction.  But it's a very interesting animal.  I played well last year.  Didn't win many matches really but I loved the way I played.  I'll be taking that attitude into this year if I get a chance.   
  
  Q.  Have you played the course before?   

 STUART APPLEBY:  No.  I don't believe so.   
  
  Q.  Happy with your game finish?   

 STUART APPLEBY:  Yeah, happy with the way I played this week.  Yeah, I have to say pretty good.  The conditions were certainly a few shots out there that were tough just under the duress of the heat and so on.   

 But, I mean, everyone was going through that and all players are good at playing the violin, but I was very happy with the way I played.  Some good things there.   

 I would like to have cracked into the Top-10, but generally pretty happy.   
  
  Q.  How big a statement do you think this makes to Gary Player if you don't crack --   

 STUART APPLEBY:  It's not a statement.  He's not in an easy position.  No captain ever is.  It's not as obvious as picking 11 and 12.  It's not as obvious as well hanging out with a guy on the move.  15th of 20th, pick him up.  It's a bit of the roll of the dice but I'm not concerned.  I would be disappointed if I wasn't on the team but certainly I understand if I'm not on the team.  Because I just want to play.  And I want to play Presidents Cup.
