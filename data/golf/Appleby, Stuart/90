Q.   Stuart, 65, low round of the day so far.  What was the difference for you from yesterday?
STUART APPLEBY:  Difference, five shots better.  Some putts, definitely some putting.  Overall I wouldn't say the round was that much different at all, just putted a little bit better.  I'm playing solid.  The putting is the key.  I made a couple nice ones today, but there was nothing extraordinary in any of the putting, it was just a good day.  If you wanted to be greedy, that's the type of day you'd want to have every time you played golf.
Q.  When the round started you were 8 back.  Now you're 4 back.  How do you like your chances?
STUART APPLEBY:  I'd like to just keep playing like I played today, just create opportunities.

Certainly it sounds a little predictable, but hitting fairways is important here.  Once you're in the fairway, you can get the ball in range, and the greens are nice enough where if you can get your iron you can make six birdies a day.  The wind hasn't gotten up to cause the players any concern.  The fairways are critical because if you miss fairways around here, you're going to drop shots.
Q.  The eagle on 9?
STUART APPLEBY:  Driver, 3wood, putt.  I hit a driver, hit a 3wood pin high, ten feet, made the putt.  It was right to left about three and a quarter inches (laughter).
Q.  And then the par 4, 5?
STUART APPLEBY:  The long one?  I hit 6iron, downwind, downhill.
Q.  13 was the longest putt you've made in a month.
STUART APPLEBY:  It's the longest par putt, yeah.  Yeah, putting hasn't been a lot of fun for me the last few months.  The best I putted was at the Presidents Cup, and I haven't really managed to roll the ball as effectively as I would have wanted, and that's where the scoring is.
Q.  Tell us about the birdie on 14.
STUART APPLEBY:  Well, I hit it right over the crowd, hit a tree, bounced back in the fairway, knocked a 9iron on, holed about a sixfooter, something like that.
Q.  Did you realize it bounced right back into the fairway?
STUART APPLEBY:  I should have walked down there quicker and had a look (laughter).
Q.  You've got to have a shot like that every now and then to have aÃ¢ï¿½  
STUART APPLEBY:  You need more of them.  You always need bounces like that.
Q.  How long was the one at 13?
STUART APPLEBY:  Par putt?  12foot, something like that.
Q.  Anymore 62s out there like there were yesterday, Bart Bryant's?
STUART APPLEBY:  I didn't see how he did that yesterday, sort of highlights package.  I imagine he hit the ball pretty good.  You've got to make a lot of birdies or you've got to have an eagle that really shifts you along.  But you've really got to get upanddown.  It's a good quality course that testsÃ¢ï¿½   allows birdies to be easily made and allows bogeys to be easily made.  That's a good quality course.  You can make runs of birdies, but all of a sudden you can make runs of bogeys, but it's quite dynamic in that sense.
Q.  Have you given enough thought to the changes for the schedule in 2007 to think whether or not you see that actually working with enough of the big guys buying into it?
STUART APPLEBY:  Well, just based on what they're going to do, you're basically herding  cattle talkÃ¢ï¿½   you're herding more of the players into a smaller window, smaller gate.  That's going to produce the better quality fields.  How much, I don't know, but that's definitely going to be more intensifying, that last two months of the Top 30 season, and I think it will be good.  I think it's great promotional material.
