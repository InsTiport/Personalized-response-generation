Q. Talk about the conditions out there.STUART APPLEBY: Well, they have got fairways, I know that.  I had an unbelievable time trying to find them.  I drove it really poorly today and I managed to eek out a 1-under par.  It's a tough golf course.  I'm probably not one of the longer hitters on Tour anymore, so if you're short and crooked, that's not good. First hole I got lucky, which was my 10th hole.  Made probably a 22-, 24-yard chip-in, difficult shot, so I got off to a good start.  Blew that early and went over par, but I think it's difficult.  You can see by the scores, there's not a bunch of guys shooting four to 6-, 7-under.
Q. How do you explain that?  There are only 13 guys in the first 60 that are under par.STUART APPLEBY: Conditions have picked up a little bit.  Guys in the afternoon are going to be more challenged with the breeze.  The greens did have a bit of rain last night so they have taken the bounce out.  They are still pretty pacy.  They will probably scruff up a bit in the afternoon.  The guys are getting a one-shot minimum difference, maybe two. It's just a lot of golf course.  Once you've had a U.S. Open here -- they have still got a lot more yardage they can use on this golf course, thank goodness, because we played back everything yesterday in the Pro-Am and it was an absolute bear. I would say hitting it long and straight is going to make a difference here because you're going to have such an easy shot compared to I'm hitting 5 and a lot of guys are going to be hitting 7s and 8s. These greens are pacy.  They have a bit of an Augusta sneakiness about them, how you have to pay attention to some of these putts; and the positions, where they can put them is quite varied and quite difficult.
