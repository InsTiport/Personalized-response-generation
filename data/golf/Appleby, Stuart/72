Q. Just talk a little bit about the conditions right now.  You're under par; there's just six guys under par.  The course is playing pretty challenging out there.
STUART APPLEBY:  It is very challenging.  The course is not letting you get on enough of a roll to make birdies.  Sometimes it's just barely letting you hang on to making pars.  There's just enough pin positions that are tight and tough, enough speed to be respected.

The fairways are tight enough.  Everything is there.  It's a good quality course.  We've probably got a little bit less rough than in previous years.  Cool temperatures make a little bit of a difference.  They make the course play longer.  As you see by the scores, we're trying our best.  It's tough out there.
Q.  Jim Furyk said the pin placements were pretty touchy.
STUART APPLEBY:  There's just so many times you weren't thinking about the flag, and if you're not getting it inside 15 feet, you're not realistically giving yourself many birdie chances.
Q.  How do you feel about your chances?
STUART APPLEBY:  It's okay.  I've got to pick it up a notch.  The course is tough but I've got to pick it up a notch.
