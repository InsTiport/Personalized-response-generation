STUART APPLEBY:  That match was of pretty ordinary quality.  No one really hit the ball any good.  You couldn't hit it any good out there, and no one really did anything on the greens.  The course was really unplayable, really had no chance of    really with stroke play, no chance of playing today.  And match play was a mess.

And I guess you're trying to make it even for both parties, but it really doesn't quite work that way.

So hopefully tomorrow we'll get something better.  But certainly we're lucky we're here with match play.
Q.  You guys were square most of the match?
STUART APPLEBY:  Yeah, he was up, I was up, square, then I birdied a 10 footer on the first hole to win the hole.  But the match never got away from anybody at any time.  It was always pretty much me ahead or we're back to square for a bit of a match.  There were no real birdies being made out there, there was nothing special.  I don't think anybody out there is going to tear the course apart; it's too sloppy.
Q.  How is your form now?
STUART APPLEBY:  I played ordinary today.  I hit the driver terrible, and it's hard to get the ball near the hole with the greens spinning sometimes; sometimes they don't.  And the greens certainly aren't smooth by any means.

I have to play better now to keep advancing.
