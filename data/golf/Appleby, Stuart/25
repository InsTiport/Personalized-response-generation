 Q. Just talk about your round of golf. 
 STUART APPLEBY: Very different golf course. My score was very different. Of course a lot more difficult, a lot longer. 
 Greens were pretty good this morning. They were pretty pacey certain parts. Tricky to read couple breaks, sort of two breaks and a ten-footer. Had a lot of lies that were straight and then move, or vice versa. 
 Yeah, very different. Certainly Mr. Justice has made maybe my score the last time you'll see that anywhere. 

 Q. Still early though. 1-over, certainly not out of the running.
 STUART APPLEBY: No, I just didn't really -- just couldn't seem to get the fire started. Couldn't get it going. Had some opportunities, but the course is tougher. You just have to get on the right -- you know, I just didn't have enough opportunities in that sort of inside 15-foot range. 
 Just got off to a dodgy start. Would have loved to be in red for sure.

 Q. You played with Watson and Mickelson. What was it like having everybody follow you today?
 STUART APPLEBY: Yeah, it was fantastic. Crowds were great. Very, very quiet. Actually that's nice. I like quiet crowds. 
 Good numbers out early, absolutely. And playing with two legends - both still growing their legendary status -- fantastic. I was definitely the third wheel out there.
