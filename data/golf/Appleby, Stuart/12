Q.   Your game's been clicking this year. 
STUART APPLEBY:   Yeah, it's definitely going in the right direction.   That's why we spend all our time practicing and looking to get the results on the golf course.   Today or this morning was really quiet.   We had very little wind until maybe the last hour out of the day, and the wind was only mild to maybe 5 miles an hour at the most. 
The course was receptive.   It's in pretty good shape though considering we had a really tough winter here.   There are some areas that have struggled a bit.   But, overall, I think you'll see low scoring this week.

Q.   It seemed to me you had control of the golf ball.   You only missed three greens out there, a clean card, no bogeys. 
STUART APPLEBY:   Yeah, I'm hitting it actually straight.   If I'm going to hit it short, I guess you have to hit it straight.   I'm not hitting it as long as I would like, but, again, if you're going to be short, you better be straight.   And I think, obviously, what's going on when the swing is moving better.   I worked on some stuff last week and had a good weekend at Hilton Head.   The path coming into the ball is getting more consistent.   I'd just like to get a bit more bang on it.

Q.   On the PGA TOUR, straight is always long. 
STUART APPLEBY:   Straight is always good.   It's easy for your caddie to get a yardage.   If you're a club or two behind the guys and further down the fairway, that's not always a disadvantage.   Again, if you're hitting 15 greens a round, there is nothing like being on the putting green.
