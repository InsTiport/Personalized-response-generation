Q. Talk about how the first two days have gone, obviously you played so well last week and played well earlier this fall. Just what's been working out there?
IM SUNGJAE: This is my last tournament, so right now, I'm in third place, but my position is pretty well and I can win maybe.
Q. You've played so much this year, why are you not playing the rest of the fall?
IM SUNGJAE: After this tournament, it's unwise to go back for two tournaments to go back there and come back again to Korea.
