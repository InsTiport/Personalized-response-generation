Q.   Nice finish, the birdie at 9, 4‑under for your opening round, and I thought you made a nice up‑and‑down at 6 and another sweet one at 8, that 12‑footer was no easy putt.   Talk about your finish?
SCOTT STALLINGS:   It was up‑and‑down for as good as I felt like I was playing.   It was nice that I made four birdies in a row through four, and you know, made par on 5 and then I hit really good shots on 6,7 and 8, just‑‑ I moved my ball position a little bit back and started not drawing it as much.   Kind of hung them out a few times.   But overall, made some nice putts throughout the day and it was nice to close off with a birdie on 9.

Q.   So your first competitive round on the PGA TOUR here at Riviera, had you played here before? 
SCOTT STALLINGS:   Yeah, I played‑‑ I got hurt in the Pro‑Am two years ago and last year my son was born.   In my rookie year I didn't get in so this is my first opportunity, and the golf course is awesome.   You know, we don't get a chance to play many like these out here.   It's pretty cool, no matter‑‑ you know, early, late, any time you're out here, especially with the weather the way it is, it's pretty awesome.

Q.   How have things changed since San Diego? 
SCOTT STALLINGS:   It was back to reality really fast, my whole family got a stomach bug the week of Phoenix and the fact that I even teed up at all was a pretty good feat.   Everybody is back healthy and my son celebrated his first birthday on Tuesday.   Nice to be out playing and especially at a place like this.
