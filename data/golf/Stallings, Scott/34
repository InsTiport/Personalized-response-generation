 Q.   A couple comments about your round.   
SCOTT STALLINGS:   I played good.   I only missed one fairway.   I don't know, it's frustrating at the beginning because I felt like I was playing really well and wasn't getting anything out of it.   My caddie kept me patient all day, and I knew if I kept driving it good, I was giving myself opportunities.   I was thankful to get in before the weather got here.   It's one day down, and definitely looking forward to the next couple.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the par putt on 5 that kind of got you going.   
SCOTT STALLINGS:   That shot and the shot on 10 were the most frustrating ones because really you're sitting over it and you're completely guessing.   There's mud all over it, and you're just sitting there, it was 192, and I was trying to hit a 6‑iron to the back of the green and have a two‑putt, and as soon as I hit it, it went straight right, and Josh said, just give us a look, and I chipped it down there about 15 feet, and that's probably the best I could have done.   So obviously making it there and finishing off the front nine like I did...  
But the golf course, even though it's soft, it's difficult.   There's not a lot of really low scores, and I think the mud might have a little bit to do with it, and they're soft, but they're really fast.   Perfect example, on 9 I hit it to five feet and I was just trying to two‑putt.   The golf course has held its own for sure.  
   
 Q.   You were looking forward to this round for such a long time, 2‑under, a great round.   I've got to think it's all you could ask for.   What are the emotions right now?  
SCOTT STALLINGS:   The emotions are‑‑ I'll be honest, I got a little‑‑ not necessarily teary‑eyed or anything like that, but some emotions were definitely flowing on the first hole.   A lot of people have helped me to get here, and it's something I'll never take for granted, but the first tee shot I'll never get back again.   So to hit the fairway was a bit of an accomplishment.   
But the whole day got started off to kind of a funny start.   I felt like I had never been to a golf tournament before.   I forgot everything.   I forgot a yardage book.   I didn't have any golf balls in the bag.   I actually showed up to the range in my tennis shoes, and my caddie is like, where are your golf shoes at.   I was very anxious to get out here and get going.   So 1:09, it seemed like it took forever to get there, and I was very happy to play well when I had the opportunity.   
   
 Q.   Talk about 13 and the break you got there.   
SCOTT STALLINGS:   Well, from the perspective where you guys were from, it was a little bit different.   That was actually a really, really good shot, it was just about five feet too far left.   I hit it really good, and it could have gone in the water, could have gone in the fairway, and I hit it really well, it was just one of those deals where I was fortunate enough for it to drop, once it nicked the tree, to drop to the right and give myself a good number, hit a good shot in there to make a birdie.  
   
 Q.   How far was that putt?  
SCOTT STALLINGS:   About eight feet.  
   
 Q.   Talk about coming up 18.   You're 2‑under, you just come off that birdie on 17.   Were there any emotions there when you got up to the green, you see the gallery, you look at the scoreboard and you see you're right there?  
SCOTT STALLINGS:   I'm not really a scoreboard watcher much.   We've got a long way to go, and there's so much newness to this for me just to understand it's a major championship, let alone a Masters.   I've held this tournament in such high esteem my whole life, and now to be a participant and to play well, it's something that you've got to learn a lot from.   You can't get too far ahead of yourself, and all the clichÃ©s that kind of go along with it.  
Obviously there weren't many emotions because it was a bit hectic out there.   The wind started blowing really hard.   TV made it look like it was sunny, but it was definitely not.   Anybody that was out there knows it's a lot darker than it showed on TV.   But it is what it is.
