 Q.   Must have been a great workout yesterday.   Just obviously not the way you wanted to finish right there.   But that string of seven birdies, have you ever run off with a string like that before?  
    SCOTT STALLINGS:   I don't know, man.   Obviously I was disappointed with a bogey, but you know what, I didn't feel super comfortable off the tee and obviously I'm not going to try to force something in there if I'm not comfortable, but I gave myself a chance to play a really good round and made some birdies, and it was fun.   Obviously when it gets going like that.   But you know, I've been making some strides in my game and it was nice to kind of see it all come together like that.  
   
 Q.   I noticed you working out like you have.   How long have you been on that kind of fitness program?   I mean you look like you're just incredibly determined, really focused on kind of the task at hand and how it transcends out here on the golf course?  
    SCOTT STALLINGS:   Definitely on days like this it makes a huge difference, but probably about two years now I've been making the transition where it's more of a priority than it was and understanding if my body doesn't work properly, then it's difficult to play golf, especially when you're asking your body to do things over and over and over again.  
   
 Q.   Your birdies, have you ever run off a string of seven straight that you can recall?  
    SCOTT STALLINGS:   In high school is the last I can remember.   John just asked me when we were walking off the last green, but that's the last I remember.   Maybe one time on the Nationwide Tour, five or six, but not seven.   That's definitely my best on tour.
