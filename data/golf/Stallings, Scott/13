Q.   Scott, a really solid ball‑striking round, you missed only two greens the whole day and one of those was because you hit an errant drive into the hazard. 
SCOTT STALLINGS:   Yeah, it was good.   It was nice to get off to a solid start in the tournament.   Some good success a few weeks ago in Australia and kind of tweaked a few things, new golf ball and a few different changes in my clubs. 
But it's nice to get out and play, and working really, really hard on my golf swing and trying to get a little more consistent and working a lot harder on my short game in the off‑season.   It was nice to get out in the first round of the new season and a play well.

Q.   You hit a good putt on 14.   
SCOTT STALLINGS:   Yeah, unfortunately when you're playing with this much grain, you don't have to hit that bad of a putt to miss.   Missed a few 6‑ , 8‑footers that maybe could have gone in.   The greens, they have done an incredible job at this place to get from Monday to where they are now.   They are rolling great and definitely looking forward to the next few days. 

Q.   Playing with someone who is 6‑under after eight, I thought you kept your patience out there. 
SCOTT STALLINGS:   Yeah, Moon played awesome.   We probably both left a few out there, but he played really good on the front and I played really good on the back and we kind of fed off each other a little bit and made a couple good pars here and there.   It was definitely a good pairing between the two of us.
