 Q.  Scott, how pleased are you with how you played, not only today, but this week, to advance on to Boston next week?  
SCOTT STALLINGS: Exciting, man.  Keep moving on, and obviously I was outside the number going into the week and I knew that a solid week would move me on.  Boston is where a bunch of my family is.  I was born just down the road.  Excited to play a golf course that I love in a town that's near and dear to my heart.   
 Q.  As your game's progress recently, kind of coming on, do you feel like you have a run in you to get to Philadelphia?  
SCOTT STALLINGS: Yeah, Aronimink is definitely a golf course that's on the top of my list.  We played there my rookie year, and I accomplished my goal and moved on to Boston.  Now I need to get ready for that event, and hopefully have a chance to move on.  East Lake is the ultimate goal but you have to take it step by step.  I think next week can go a long way to that.
