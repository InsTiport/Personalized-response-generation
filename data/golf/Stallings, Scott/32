  SCOTT STALLINGS:   Yeah, I mean, I definitely hadn't had very good form coming into the week and missed a lot of cuts, and I've had a lot of‑‑ just a lot has gone on and the beginning of the season definitely hasn't gone nearly as close as I would have liked.   
But I love the golf course.   This is my favorite tournament of the season, non‑Masters, and it's a special place, and happy to play well today.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT STALLINGS:   We've got a long way to go.   I was happy to get a good round under par.   I haven't had a round under par since Saturday at Augusta.   It's been a long time.   Been really struggling with my game coming back from injury, and I was healed, I wasn't healed, and kind of the ebbs and flows that go along with that.   It's been interesting to say the least.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT STALLINGS:   Absolutely.   It wasn't due to lack of effort.   It was one of those things to where you know you're working hard and you're doing all the right things, it's just a matter of time to where it all gets put together.   
My caddie and I were working hard, my coach came up for three days this week and we got after it, and he kept pumping me up the whole time saying, It's just a matter of time.   
I made a few putts and I hit the ball nice all day, and when I got in trouble I got up‑and‑down.   That's what you need to do around here.   But it was kind of the end result of the tournament, I'm not really worried about it.   It was nice to have a good solid round under par, and I'll go out tomorrow and try to do the same.
