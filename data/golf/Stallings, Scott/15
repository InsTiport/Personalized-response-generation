 Q.   Give us some thoughts about your round.   
SCOTT STALLINGS:   It was good.   I haven't played very good of late and I definitely haven't played very good here.   
But it's a golf course that suits my eye, you definitely have to learn how to play your way around it.   My caddie did great job as far as making sure I was aggressive all day.   It was one of those deals where I got it under par and I kept it under par and I stayed aggressive all the way through, all the way through 18.   It was a nice day.   
   
 Q.   Scott, did you know that 64 of the 72 guys that have played this morning are at even or better?   Does that surprise you?  
SCOTT STALLINGS:   No, I think that the tournament is doing an incredible job.   It's a little bit softer and slower than normal, the fairways aren't really running out like they do, but they have to be protective at the beginning of the week.   Dealing with what this place has dealt with over the past few months, it's pretty incredible to get it to where it is.   
It will be awesome come Sunday, but they did a great job of setting it up.   If you were to ask all the players how they would want it, they would have said about like this.   
   
 Q.   So everybody's going to make birdies.   It's those par saves and avoiding the big number that seem to keep the momentum going.   
SCOTT STALLINGS:   Yeah, absolutely.   That's the same with any round, whether you're here, whether you're next week, or whether, no matter what tournament you're playing in, that's what separates a good round from a great round.   
This place, you just have a little bit more opportunity to make some bigger numbers than most places.
