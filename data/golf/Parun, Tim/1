Q.   A little tougher day today.   How did it go out there?
TIM PARUN:   It wasn't that tough, I played actually pretty well for 14 holes.   I had opportunities, didn't can them.   But I was even par at that point, so I was actually playing pretty good. 
Then I made a poor decision on 15 on the lay up.   Got in the bunker and then hit it in the hazard and made double. 

Q.   So it was just a bad finish. 
TIM PARUN:   Actually I was pretty happy the way I played for the first 14. 

Q.   Definitely.   I mean, you're plus 7 or plus 6 right now, what are you looking for going into tomorrow?   You're still having that opportunity to be the top club pro still.   Is that kind of in the back of your mind or are you going to go out there and go as low as possible, of course?
TIM PARUN:   Well, you go as low as possible.   I'm going to maybe play nine holes and see if they will take that score. 

Q.   Anything you're looking to change going into tomorrow?
TIM PARUN:   Maybe I can fill out the scorecard?   I don't know. 
No, I thought that everything was pretty good, managed my emotions, had my focus pretty good, sometimes you don't make the putts, but I just made a poor decision.   A poor decision and then lost focus on a couple shots coming in.   So don't need to change anything.   I feel my game's good. 

Q.   Perfect.   And how the course is set up between the weekend and the first two days, did it seem a little different to you?
TIM PARUN:   Not really.   Not really.   Fair.   There's some good holes out there.   Wind's playing on a few, but also some you take advantage of.   Pins in general, about the same.   So, no.
