  Q. Talk about your day today?  
 TIM PARUN: It was pretty good. We finished six holes and I played those very solid. Birdied the last two, but had birdie chances on all of them. So really happy how I finished that round at even.   
 Kind of let it loose at the start of the second round, but I was happy, I hung in there, I wasn't swinging it quite as good the rest of the way, but I ground it out, I got up-and-down when I needed to and just kind of made it happen. Hung in there. A little tired. So not bad.   
  
  Q. Talk about the course.   
 TIM PARUN: I love the golf course. I think it's a fabulous course. I think it drains incredibly well for what's happened to it. It's a little muddy, but I think that it's fantastic. I didn't have mud on the ball that much. So almost could have played it up. I mean really, it was pretty good.   
 But it's a fabulous golf course. And I'm sure that if it was dry weather and you get it firm and fast, it's a great test of golf.
