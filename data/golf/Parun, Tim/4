  Q. How was your day?  
 TIMOTHY PARUN: It was a lot of fun, I got to play with Keith, we led out the field today, so it was a beautiful morning.   
 A little bit of a struggle swinging the club today, but I had some beautiful up-and-down opportunities. Just really enjoyable today. So it was all good.   
  
  Q. Talk about your week, if you will. Just the whole experience.   
 TIMOTHY PARUN: I was really looking forward to this, this is my first Senior PGA Championship. I loved coming back here. I played here 10 years ago in the Club Pro, so I kind of had a feel for it. But really felt good and pretty comfortable all week. Which I had been thinking about doing. And really happy the first two rounds how I played, how I kept my composure. Just how I kept my head in the game.   
 The last couple days wasn't as bad as it looked, but it wasn't as strong, scrambling and stuff, so the whole week I'm not asking for anything more. It was really wonderful. The experience was great. I feel good about myself and my game, so really happy about it all.
