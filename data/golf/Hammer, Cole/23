 Q.  Describe the experience of being 15 and playing a U.S. Open.  COLE HAMMER: Oh, man, it was awesome.  I had a blast.  It was the best time of my life.   Q.  Today didn't go as well as your first round.  What trouble did you run into out there?  COLE HAMMER: I just hit a lot of bad shots.  I mean, I guess that kind of explains itself.  I didn't hit the ball solid enough to be able to score.   Q.  Was there any one thing that may have caused you problems today or was it a combination of things?  COLE HAMMER: It was just everything, my ball striking, I didn't make enough putts.  I felt like my short game was good, I just didn't make enough putts and didn't hit the ball well enough.   Q.  What do you take away from an experience that a lot of adults don't get to do, let alone a 15-year-old?  COLE HAMMER: It was just awesome.  I had a great time.  I can't even describe it.  It was such a cool feeling.   Q.  What do you do from here?  COLE HAMMER: I'm going to go to play some junior golf for the rest of my high school career, I can't wait for that.  I've got some good strong tournaments lined up for this summer, so I'm excited to get that going.  I'm sure this will give me a good experience going forward.   Q.  Do you want to try this again next year, try another Open?  COLE HAMMER: I will try, yes, sir.  I definitely will.
