 Q.  So just kind of tell me how you're feeling after today's play?  
COLE HAMMER: Good.  It was solid ground.  That's all I needed.  It's nice to have one of the higher seeds going into Match Play.  I mean, whenever you make Match Play it's good because it wipes the slate clean, so I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.   
 Q.  Sure, and talk about 18 a little bit.  Just where were you, about a foot and a half out?  You had a first putt from the fringe, kind of brought it in close.  
COLE HAMMER: I had about six feet for par.  I think my putt just broke a little more than we thought and lipped out on the left side.   
 Q.  But you did get a birdie on 17.  Walk me through that birdie.  
 A. Yeah, it was like 199 with a right-to-left into the wind, and I hit a 5-iron.  Landed pretty close to the hole, almost went in.  Went to 8 feet, made that putt for birdie and I was solid going into the last hole.   
 Q.  Throughout play, was there any hole that really stuck out to you, other than 17 of course, that kind of solidified today's round?  
 A. Yeah, I made a great birdie on number 9.  It's one of the hardest holes on the court.  I hit it in the rough and hit it to five feet somehow and knocked that one in for birdie.  Then birdied 11, hit the green into a two-putt, and that was a nice, stress-free birdie.   
 Q.  Anything you're looking forward to tomorrow?  
 A. I love Match Play.  I just love it.  It's a different type of golf, and I feel like I'm really solid at it, and I'm looking forward to Match Play.
