Q. Great round today.  Tell us what it was like, the conditions and overall the round today.
PORNANONG PHATLUM: I made not much birdies today.  The pins is kind of hard to get close to the pin today.  Yeah, it's very hot out there, so just try to focus on the game and drink a lot.
Q. You ended on a strong note today.  What was your approach, was it to play it safe or was it aggressive?
PORNANONG PHATLUM: I did play safe today but I didn't putt good today.  Couldn't make birdie much.
Q. The greens are tough, though, with a lot of undulations?
PORNANONG PHATLUM: Yes.
Q. How was the week overall for you being out here in Blue Bay?
PORNANONG PHATLUM: It's a good week and finish good this week.  Because I didn't play good for like a couple months, so this week, Top-10, so that's very great.
