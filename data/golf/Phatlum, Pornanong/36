Q.   Take me through the day.   Obviously, really strong.   How did the birdies go? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Like today the course was very good, and the driver is very straight.   And I keep on the fairway for every hole, and it was easy to get near the pin. 
Today I played very good, my putting, everything was very good.

Q.   Did you find yourself in trouble in any bad areas?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   No, not today.

Q.   Coming off a really strong finish at Kia.   You had a really good last round there.   Did you try to just keep those good vibes coming into this week, or what did you do in the off week to keep that momentum coming? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yeah, just keep good confidence last week and do my best this week.

Q.   When did you and your brother start the matching?   We have to ask because that's always a fashion question.   When did you guys start dressing the same? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Last year.   I think in Thailand at Hyundai last year.

Q.   So when you were back home, you started matching? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yes.

Q.   Is he upset he has to wear the one piece over, because you can't tell?   Are you still matching? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yes, uhâ€‘huh.

Q.   So game plan going into the weekend?   You've got yourself into a good position.   Anything you're going to concentrate on going into tomorrow and Sunday? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yeah, I'll try to hit on the fairway because the loft is very long, it's hard to play on the loft.   Just keep my confidence like it is and just putt well.

Q.   Do you think you'll be nervous tomorrow? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I think I will be a little bit, but I'll try my best.

Q.   How do you like this course? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yeah, it's a very nice course.   Every year I'm not playing very good on this course.   This year everything is better, and I'm trying to keep my good confidence.

Q.   So this year has been the best you think you've performed on this course? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yes.
