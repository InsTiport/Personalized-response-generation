Q.   How big was last year's win in terms of your career?   How big was this event win?   How much did it mean to you? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   It gave me more confidence to win this one, because I know this tournament is a major, also can count as a major event in my achievements.   After I win, I gained more experience and more confidence and my play in the LPGA in 2014 is very good this year.

Q.   How do you feel about defending your title? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I have a lot of confidence this year because I love the course, love the weather.   When I practiced yesterday, it made me relaxed when I played. 

Q.   Just going back to last year, obviously you and Stacy were in contention, and Stacy is a very good player.   What was it like, was it surprising for you to beat Stacy, and is that what gave you the confidence this year?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I know that I'm high ranking in the world, like No. 1 in the world, but when I play, I try to beat myself, also, and try to keep up the score with Stacy.   And when I pass that, it makes me have more confidence that I can do this. 

Q.   Who do you think your biggest challengers are this weekend? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   This year, there are many strong players from the European Tour, also, and from LPGA also.   So I think there are many good competitors.

Q.   Women's golf coming up in Thailand, is it coming like in South Korea? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I want to say more Thai players play and also more tournaments in Thailand, also.   In Thailand, the tournaments are growing and we have more events, and some of the players that play in like Asia are coming to Japan or coming to the U.S. Tour.   Yeah, I want that for the younger players to start coming up into the tournaments and play.
