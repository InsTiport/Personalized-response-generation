 Q.  Can you tell me a bit about, you know, you're dressed fully in black today and how long you plan to continue to wear black to mark the death of your king?  
PORNANONG PHATLUM: I am planning to wear just for respecting the king until the last event of LPGA this year, which is CME.   
But if I can, I'm going to continue wearing it for like maybe another month also.   
 Q.  Even after CME?  
PORNANONG PHATLUM: Yeah, because the government is doing a year.   
 Q.  So even on and off the course you will continue to as well?  
PORNANONG PHATLUM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Have you and your fellow players from Thailand done anything while you've been out here to take part in what's going on back home?  
PORNANONG PHATLUM: We can't really do anything since we're here, so just focus on do our best for the king.  You know, like every action is just like hoping the king knows what we doing for the country.  That's what the king was hoping for.   
So what we been doing is just posting on Instagram and Facebook to just show the respect to people in Thailand.  Just show them that we know what's going on, like that.
