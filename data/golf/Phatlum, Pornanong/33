Q.     Another good day.   Not as good as the last two, but just take us through your round, how you felt and how you're feeling now afterward?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I'm just okay with my score today, and putting not really good today.   Just try my best tomorrow.

Q.   You said you thought there was going to be pressure coming into today and tomorrow.   Did you feel nervous on the first tee or were you nervous waking up today?   Was it any different than the past two days? 
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Not really different, but I can't‑‑ like putting not very good like the last two days.

Q.   When you don't feel like your putter is really working, is there a mental block, or how do you get over the fact that not as many putts are dropping as were in the past?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Maybe the pressure today.   Today is like slow today, and I feel like not comfortable.

Q.   Not as comfortable; you weren't really kind of getting into a rhythm as much as yesterday?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yeah.

Q.   Did you notice a lot of the low scores early on?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yeah, I saw.

Q.   Did you feel pressure like you maybe had to shoot a low score to keep up?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I didn't think about that, just try my best.   Kind of today the lie, and long putt today not hitting good much.

Q.   What about the game plan for tomorrow?   You're right in the mix, only three back from Yani, but a lot of good players up at the top.   Anything you're going to try to do tomorrow to hopefully keep you right there?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I will try to focus on putting.   This course is going to be‑‑ like can make the birdies, like focus on putt more.

Q.   It seems everybody who is ranked high in putting this week is up on the leaderboard, so do you think it's going to come down to who's putting the best?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yeah.
