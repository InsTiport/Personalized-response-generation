 Q.  A great round today.  Start us off about conditions.  How wet was it?  How much different was the course playing?  
PORNANONG PHATLUM: It was pretty wet today.  I think the greens were more soft because of the rain, so it made me like -- can approach, stop --   
 Q.  Stop on your target?  
PORNANONG PHATLUM: Yeah, distance control is better.   
 Q.  How much adjustment was that for the speed of the greens?  I know everybody said this week they were so fast.
