Q. You're done with the first round here in Jersey.  How is it to be back and how do you feel after your first round?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I feel pretty good today.  I just work on my game a lot this year.  I just try to be confident every shot that I play, and today is pretty good today.
Q. That's good.  You had an eagle out there today as well.  Take us through the eagle real quick.
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   That hole, the second shot is about 80 yards like into the wind, and I hit like 53 degree.  Then I hit it pretty good and it's just like -- yeah, it just in the hole.
I didn't see ball because the little hill before the hole.  Yeah, and just surprise.
Q. So were you really happy when you saw it in the hole?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   Yeah, really surprise.
Q. And what is there to work on for tomorrow?
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   I just play on my game for tomorrow.  I hope the wind not like very windy like every year, so just try to play my best.
