Q. Well, Mo, that was a tight match, never more than 1-up for either team and you were 1-up heading to 17.  How do you feel after it all ended?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well like everybody played hard today and we really have to play a really good match and they're a super strong team.  And like myself I made like five or six birdies and she had to win the hole with like eagle and that's become a really, really great match and it was close.
Q. You made a lovely birdie on 14.  What length was that to put you 1-up?  And it looked as though that might be the decisive birdie.
PORNANONG PHATLUM: The eagle?
Q. On 14, beg your pardon, eagle.  Yeah.
PORNANONG PHATLUM: Yeah.  So it was very close to the pin.
Q. What club did you have coming in?
PORNANONG PHATLUM: Driver.  I was lucky.  It was a good shot.
Q. How close to the pin?
PORNANONG PHATLUM: About three or four feet.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, she hit it really good.
Q. Was there one key hole apart from that eagle today for your team?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well I think, no.  To me the key is like you just have to talk to each other, like what you want to do or what you want the other to do.  And just try to support each other with the game.
Q. Obviously you want to get a win on the board, first match out, you both played well, but you couldn't close out the win.  It's a halved match.  Do you feel a little bit of disappointment?
PORNANONG PHATLUM: A little bit.  We tried to win today, but they're very good players.  Everybody tried hard.  We both played great and also our team has been playing great as well.
Q. Nasa had a great birdie, birdie finish.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, so they made birdie, birdie finish to tie and so that shows like how good they are.
Q. How cool was it having your sister watching you, having won her match a couple of holes behind?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I was actually asking her, like, did you see the group behind us?  And they were like, no, we haven't seen them, so we had no idea.
Q. Yeah, she was watching you on 18 green.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: That's good.
Q. Last question.  Both of you playing well today, is this good for momentum going into tomorrow?
PORNANONG PHATLUM: To me it's a decision that the team has to make and it's still a secret for us.  Like we haven't talked to each other like the four of us and we don't know what's going to go tomorrow.
