Q.   Must be very tired.   This whole week was very emotional.   Just talk about how big of a week this was for you to play well.

Yeah, it's fun to play with I.K. Kim.   She played very good and, yeah, a little bit of pressure on me. 

Q.   Very close match the whole time today.   How much did you have to keep your composure and play one hole at a time?   How important was that?
