Q. First of all, was it your first hole in one?
JAY MCLUEN: No, I couldn't remember how many I've had.  It was my third in tournaments.  But I don't know how many I've had.  Maybe seven, maybe eight now.  But it was pretty cool.
Q. What kind of confidence does that give you, especially in the first round, kind of early (indiscernible) something like that?
JAY MCLUEN: I only missed one green today and it was actually a shank.  So I don't think I've ever had a hole in one and a shank in the same round.  We had a good plan today.  My caddie helped me out quite a bit.  We tried to stay shot by shot, really picking small targets.  So just been working hard since I've been hurt.  So it's been nice to come out here and get a great start again.
Q. Overall you've got to be pretty pleased with the way you've finished today.  On the leaderboard and in contention -- can't really ask for much more in first round?
JAY MCLUEN: Last year I was tied for second after the first round too here, but let off the gas a little bit.  There's a different formula this here to kind of stay up there, but it's supposed to get windy and stuff like that tomorrow afternoon.  So it's a good start again.  Can't ask for much more.
Q. Take us through number 11, Jay.  Just one shot, but how were the conditions?
JAY MCLUEN: It was 139 yards.  And I think it was just a little right to left, and my caddie said you've got plenty of room right.  I said, okay.  And it was just a perfect pitching wedge and hit it good.  It was right at the flag.  The crowd started -- I saw it bounce but couldn't see it go in.  But saw the crowd kind of stand up, started yelling when it went in pretty cool.  I didn't get the truck, though.  The truck was yesterday, I think.
