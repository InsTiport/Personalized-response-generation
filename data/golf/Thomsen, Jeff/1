Q.  How does it feel being a club pro and having a great opening day?
JEFF THOMSEN:  Well, every day's opening day.  My clubs don't know I'm a club pro.  My club's don't know it's hot.

So I played well today.  I'm happy to shoot an opening round under par.

I just played well.  It was a nice day and the wind laid down, still coming out of the southeast, but I am happy with the way I played.
Q.  Were there any highlight holes for you?
JEFF THOMSEN:  Not really, just really steady.  I chipped in for a birdie on number 6 from in front of the green or number 5, I think.  So that was nice.  I was maybe staring at a potential par or bogey, so that was nice.
Q.  What are your expectations for the rest of the tournament?
JEFF THOMSEN:  My expectations are to just keep executing good golf shots and make good decisions and play as smart as I can and hopefully Sunday that will be good enough.
