Q.  How was your practice today?
JEFF THOMSEN:  Good.  I played three rounds already, so just practice today.  Practice and rest today.
Q.  Do you feel confident about tomorrow?
JEFF THOMSEN:  Well, what I feel confident about is that it's a good, hard, golf course.  And you are just going to have to be very patient and pay attention to what the golf course is telling you to do and the wind and hit quality shots and execute some good shots and add them up.
