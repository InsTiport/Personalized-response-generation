Q.   Just thoughts on how the first two days have gone?
ZACHARY BLAIR:   Yeah, I played well.   Was hitting it pretty good.   Rolled in a few putts, so it was a good start.

Q.   You played well at the Web.com Tour championship obviously.   Anything click the last six rounds or so?
ZACHARY BLAIR:   Just maybe was a little less hard on myself, putting a little too much pressure on myself maybe those few weeks where I missed the cuts.
But you know, you obviously want to go out and play well, so it was nice to get a good start in.

Q.   What were your goals coming into this week for you?
ZACHARY BLAIR:   Make the cut, and then get into contention on the weekend is always kind of a good one.

Q.   That's where you are now, so how does it change going into tomorrow?
ZACHARY BLAIR:   Same thing.   Just try to hit shots down the middle of the green and roll in some putts would be nice.

Q.   And tomorrow you'll be second to last group.   Thoughts on being in that position?
ZACHARY BLAIR:   Yeah, I was the last group today, so yeah, I pulled the pins in today, so it would be nice to stay there.
