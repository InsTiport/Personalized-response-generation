  Q. How good of a score is 67 out there today?   
 JUSTIN GUERRIER: I'm very okay with that. I had a good start. I made two birdies in the beginning, one bogey, so stayed focussed, and after, on the 17th, it was my eighth, I didn't play really good. My feeling was bad. My sensation was wrong, I don't know why, but I said calm, and I say, okay, make your best and after the fifth, I hit some good shots.   
 I think the patience, it's the key of the golf.   
  
  Q. Saw some excellent short game from you today. Is that generally a good part of your game?   
 JUSTIN GUERRIER: You know, yeah, I want to say, yeah, when I play well, I chip well. So it's one good part of my game but normally my good part, it's the driving. In the middle of the course, I didn't play well with the driver, and when you miss the fairway on this course, especially, it's really hard to make par and birdie.   
  
  Q. Your best performance of the year came last week, fifth place there, has something clicked in your game? Has something come right?   
 JUSTIN GUERRIER: Just that I try -- I saw Martin Kaymer, 26 years old and he made the fantastic title in the US PGA and I said, he's a good player, but I'm a good striker and I can do it.   
 So I try to do it and I don't try too much, just play your golf, play your best and go see the flag and play it. That's all.
