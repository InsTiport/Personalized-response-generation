ANDREW COLTART:   Just 5-iron second shot, which didn't come out like I thought; it was the wrong club.  Came up short of the green.  Chipped it over the back of the green.  3-putted the fourth.  7, hit a little 8-iron about eight, nine feet.  Holed that. 12, I hit a 3-iron to the back of the green.  17, about 20 yards short of the green and played a nice chip to about three feet and holed that. Just caught the bunker on the last.  Didn't come out of the trap like I was expecting it to. You know, today was a bit better.  Today I hit the ball better than the past couple days, which is strange given my score.  You know, if I post a good score fairly early on tomorrow  -- will let people think about it. 

Q.  Funny breezes coming and going?

ANDREW COLTART:   It's pretty tricky.  Tricky to find the right club and try to find out where the breeze is.
