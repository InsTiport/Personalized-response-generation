  PETER HANSON: It was always kind of a weird feeling to see the ball disappear.  Everybody that played the game that had a hole-in-one knows what it's like, and it's a great feeling.
Q. And the giveaway?PETER HANSON: I thought it was only on hole No. 10.  Seem to have a big attempt on No. 10, kind of a signature hole here. But was very happy to hear a lady named Arlene got a free mortgage for a year, so I'm glad I could make someone happy.
Q. Do you get to invite yourself over maybe to a barbeque or something?  You did pay for the mortgage.PETER HANSON: (Laughs) yeah, maybe I should do that.  Actually Billy Haas's caddie said, "Drinks are on you I guess."    I offered him Gatorade out of the cooler but didn't really want it (laughing).
Q. And you birdied 18.  Nice way to end the day.PETER HANSON: Yeah, it was a bit up and down.  I actually started with a 3-putt on the first hole from pretty short range, so a bit disappointed walking on to the second tee, see the ball disappear for a one, and then made bogey on 3. My game has been a little bit up and down, but like you said, it was fun to finish strong with birdie and hopefully I can build on that for tomorrow.
