Q.   You were sent to a playoff, how do you feel? 
PETER HANSON:   It feels great.   Shane played very well today and I didn't have a chance in the regular match. 

Q.   Talk about the pressures of a playoff; you have to muster the energy to get through a three‑man playoff. 
PETER HANSON:   It's hard, when you play and come under, it's a lot of pressure and you have to make those putts.   Lucky enough today to make a couple good up‑and‑downs on the first hole and then made a good little downhill left‑to‑right putt on the second hole. 

Q.   Your thoughts on a strange scenario, if you like, to get beaten in terms of score but having to come through in a playoff?
PETER HANSON:   Of course, it's feeling great now that I made it through.   I got beaten badly after Shane played very well and I was losing a few balls off the tee. 
But you know, this is the great thing about this format and the way we play, it's good fun and it's exciting for us, and you know, happy to make it through. 

Q.   In Monopoly terms, it's a Get Out of Jail Free card, isn't it? 
PETER HANSON:   It is a little bit.   Normally you can't lose and still be in it, and this is match play, and I need to play better but I need to play better than I've done the first two days.   But you never know, I might find something tomorrow and sneak through another match. 
I lost a ball on the 14th or 15th hole, and you know, walked down and tried to make that chip, tried to get a halve and then it was straight back to work.   No real disappointment; just get back to work and try to hit a good tee shot down.
