Q.   Good to get a round like that to start?
PETER HANSON:   That was good. It's always nice to get off to a good start.   6‑under today, I'm very happy.   Felt good.   I drove it well.   Hit some nice approach shots, made some putts and missed a few putts but it was overall a good, solid round of golf.

Q.   On what is a challenging and very long course. 
PETER HANSON:   We were lucky today, conditions were perfect, not too much wind and soft, soft golf course.   Makes the course play very long but if you control your approach shot with soft greens and as good of this course is condition‑wise, you will get a few chances.

Q.   Tell me about this course and its Swedish nature, because it's named after a very famous Swedish lake?
PETER HANSON:   Yeah, Lake MÃ¤laren.   There's not a lot of people that can say that, but obviously the owner paid a visit to the city of Sollentuna and fell in love with the place and he actually copied the city centre and built this golf course and named it after MÃ¤laren, which is approaching Bro Hof where we play the Scandinavian Masters. 

Q.   Is there anything more Swedish about the nature of the course?   The way the lakes move around, there's a little bit of run‑off?
PETER HANSON:   I think so, with the length of the golf course, probably this one and Bro Hof are probably the two longest golf courses in the world I would say.   Definitely feels like it.   But definitely the two longest we play on Tour, so similar kind of design, kind of generous fairways and tricky greens, all of these humps and bumps, so it feels a bit similar when you play it.

Q.   I don't know if feel at home is the right phrase but you must feel comfortable knowing your teammates from The Ryder Cup are here?
PETER HANSON:   Yeah, it was great to see them again, to spend a bit of time.   We are trying to get together a little bit and it's always nice to get back with all those sweet memories and fond memories of Chicago.   It's just nice to see the boys again. 

Q.   And is it that little bit different knowing the euphoria has passed and you can reflect almost like a drink over at the pub with your mates?
PETER HANSON:   I actually have to say that I took a couple of weeks pretty easy.   I played the Dunhill but played it more like the amateurs did, stayed up late in the evenings and just went out and enjoyed the links golf course.   You know, didn't have a great result but that was‑‑ took it easy and celebrated after The Ryder Cup. 
Now we are back to business again.   This is a big week.   BMW always put on a big event, and 78‑man field, strong field, as well, and playing for a huge purse, so back to work and try to get up and try to win tournaments.
