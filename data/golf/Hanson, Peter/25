Q.   71 today for Peter Hanson, got off to a nice hot start with that birdie at 1.   Did you know at the beginning that it was going to take birdies today. 
PETER HANSON:   It felt like it.   The greens were a bit soft today, and the wind was up, but it was still very playable.   I saw someone getting up the board, Ian Poulter had a really good round, so I was trying to hang in there and make a few birdies, but I just didn't take the chances I got.

Q.   How quickly did you see those low numbers, and did it make you try and force the accelerator a little bit out there?
PETER HANSON:   Yeah, maybe a little bit.   I felt I was a bit behind already on the first tee there, but you know, you get off to a good start and then made a couple clumsy ones in the second nine, and Tiger did the same thing, missed a short putt on 12 for birdie and made bogey on 11.   We didn't really get anything going in the group.
Sometimes you just need a bit of momentum to get in there.   71, a bit disappointed, but still, you know, decent result.

Q.   This course gave you a little bit of everything.   What was this championship like? 
PETER HANSON:   I mean, it was great.   This is a fantastic golf course, and playing down here, it's very hot for being a Swede.   We're used to the cold and been sweating a lot.   Only one thunderstorm, can't complain.   Overall it's been a great week.
