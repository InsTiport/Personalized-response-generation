Q. I take it you're pretty excited, aren't you, at the moment?
PETER HANSON: Yeah, but it was fun being out there, obviously playing with Lee and playing with Bernd, we had plenty of support with these amazing crowds.  Kind of new to me.  I haven't been in that situation for such a long time, so it was nice to feel a bit of nerve and see the people around.  Back to old days.
Q. I take it it is that slightly different feeling, slightly different adrenaline levels and the juices flowing?
PETER HANSON: It is.  It just makes it so much fun.  Walking down here today all day we had great support.  It just makes you a little bit sharper, and like we talked about yesterday, I putted better today.  I didn't hit it as nice but made a couple of good putts coming down the stretch, a couple of birdie putts and a couple of par saves.  It was overall a very good day.
Q. When you start off the way you did, I imagine that sort of whips it up, as well.
PETER HANSON: Yeah, it's so nice to get it going.  I think that kind of helped.  That first tee was full of people.  It's just a different feel than when you're out there playing yourself and you don't have that many people behind you, you're maybe not as sharp.  So it kind of gets the better out of you when you have more people around.
Like I said, playing with Lee helped.  Obviously they are out here to cheer for him and so on, but it kind of feeds over to me, as well.
Q. You've been there on so many occasions.  Do you draw on that when you go into a final round?
PETER HANSON: I hope to be able to say as calm as I did today and just keep focusing on my game.  Obviously it helps if you're up there week-in and week-out, I think it helps you to perform and maybe pull off a win.  I'm just going to try to work with myself tomorrow and try to focus on the right things, and then we'll see what happens.
