Q.
A day of two halves?
PETER HANSON:  It sure was.  It was really tough out there today.  The wind was really tricky.  I was hitting the ball really, really nice today, but made a couple of stupid decisions, hitting a club too much off 8 and ended up making double from that slope up there.

Good finish, which is always nice.  I just told Duncan after we finished the front nine, I was plus four after nine holes and I hit one bad shot.  Didn't feel like I was playing that bad.  So if I just kept playing and maybe a few went in, we should still be all right.
Q.  Is that a case of getting out of your head and ignoring it almost?
PETER HANSON:  It's very easy to be frustrated, but when you feel you're hitting the ball good, and I was hitting    yeah, the front nine, I think I was hitting the ball better than I did the back nine here, which is really strange.
Q.  17, the eagle, what did you do?
PETER HANSON:  I managed to hit a really good tee shot with a 3 wood all the way down around the corner, only had a five left, and made about another 25 foot putt.
Q.  Thoughts for tomorrow?
PETER HANSON:  It's going to be fun tomorrow.  I hope the wind gets down so we can play a little bit more aggressive tomorrow, because I'm four shots behind and got some work to do.
