 Q.  Tell us about the 18? 
 PETER HANSON:  It's always nice to make a hole-in-one on a par 5.  Never happened before. 

 Q.  What club was it? 
 PETER HANSON:  I was aiming straight at it.  After good opportunities on 16 and 17, a little bit frustrating, but pulled a 6-iron straight at it.  And even when you see it, you're always surprised. 

 Q.  How many have you had? 
 PETER HANSON:  This is my fifth. 

 Q.  Have you had any on Tour? 
 PETER HANSON:  Three. 

 Q.  Pretty good shape, suggests that you're really on top of your game; is that the way it feels? 
 PETER HANSON:  Yeah driving it good and hitting a lot of groans and almost made both putts, the greens are really pure. 
 It's up to the player to just read the greens right and hit it well. 

 Q.  Coming into a week like this, ball-striker's week, difficult golf course, do you feel your chances are pretty good? 
 PETER HANSON:  Yeah, I made it through qualifying on upon day at Sunningdale and have been hitting the ball very solid. 

 Q.  Fancy your chances tomorrow? 
 PETER HANSON:  Absolutely, with the finish, being 5-under coming into the last and now being 7, it's a big, big difference.
