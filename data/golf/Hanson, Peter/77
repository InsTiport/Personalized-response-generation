 Q. It looked as if you were dead and buried but had a good performance; the ones you holed on 17 and 18 pulled it out of the bag. 
 HENRIK STENSON: He hit a great shot into 18. I thought we had the advantage on 16. Peter hit a good drive and they were in the trees and they had a good bunker shot and were in trouble and won quite easily in the end. Wanted to give ourselves a chance on 17 and had it, and the GB&I Team made, I don't know, 20, 30 of those putts during these three days. And it was just nice to be able to get a few back. And to make that one, give us a chance on the last, Pete was dying to get the shot on the last and hit another iron, and I hit a great putt and managed to get a half a point out of that. 

 Q. It's such a slippery putt from there, as well, isn't it; his pace was just perfect. 
 HENRIK STENSON: Very pleasing to get a half a point out of that and take them right to the finish. 
 PETER HANSON: We have been struggling, and thought we came out and battled Graeme and Rory pretty good in the greensomes. And then we had a bad start here in the fourth and made a couple early bogeys and struggled a little bit with the golf ball, and Henrik was hitting it a little further. 
 I thought we played okay in the middle but fought a couple of bad breaks on 8 and 9, a couple of bad bounces; shouldn't blame that. But it was nice to get a half a point.
 HENRIK STENSON: We didn't give up. That's the main thing. It was looking very dark until that putt slipped in on the last. We haven't been playing great as a team but I just have to say that the GB&I Team have putted fantastically and played solid, the first two fourballs that I lost to, they were 10-under after 13 and 10-under after 17. 
 Hats off to them, they went out there and crushed us this week. There might be a small chance for us to come back tomorrow. 
 PETER HANSON: We need a few of those putts. They have had such a strong team and really everything they have put out on the course they have been playing fantastic. We just have to go out and do our thing tomorrow and get some early birdies and get a few blue boards up there.
