 Q. I was going to ask you what your secret to success was, but you've had 31 putts in 66 shots; you must have hit it amazingly well. 
 PETER HANSON: It was really solid today. I was hitting driver well and my irons were really, really good, and so got off to a great start, birdieing 1 and 2, and then I 3-putted four 4 and 5, back to level of par. I hit most of the par 5s in two shots and hit all the greens.

 Q. Have you ever swung the club better then? 
 PETER HANSON: I don't think so. It's starting to get really, really good. Of course with the win in Sweden, I was hitting my irons really well and the driver is starting to get really good now. 

 Q. What is a satisfy score in these conditions for the leaders just going out there?
 PETER HANSON: With the greens spiking up in the afternoon, anyone getting underneath 70 is going to be really, really happy. 
 Teeing off early today of course helped with the greens being a little bit better.

 Q. Obviously you're still in The Ryder Cup picture in terms of a wildcard pick, you can't make the team outright, but having won to weeks ago, and if you won here, would he have to take notice, wouldn't he?
 PETER HANSON: I certainly hope so. To be fair I'm trying to, I changed my schedule last week to go and play in Holland but I was really tired and wasn't playing well but this week I want to give it everything I have and just see what happens.

 Q. What's the game plan tomorrow?
 PETER HANSON: Very aggressive. 

 Q. Go for every flag, go for every birdie?
 PETER HANSON: I think I have to. It's nice to come off the win as well and really, with that win, that's what I'm trying to get, more wins.
