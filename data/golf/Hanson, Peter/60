 Q. You hit quite a shot out there, walk us through that one. 
 PETER HANSON: It was tough. Crucial point, really. Very hard-fought and we made a bit of a miss, back to all-square, and stood on the 15th tee and Bubba hit a great tee shot and Jeff, as well, both middle of the green. I pulled mine left, my drive and didn't look good but able to get up-and-down out of that water hazard. 

 Q. Biggest up-and-down of your life? 
 PETER HANSON: I think maybe even Seve would have been pretty happy about that. 

 Q. And the key tomorrow? 
 PETER HANSON: The key tomorrow is just to stay in my game and try to win my point. It's going to be a key thing. We have got strong players coming out and hopefully we can get a bit of blue on the board. If I can focus on my game, try to win that.
