 Q.  Good score over the two days?  
PETER HANSON: Yeah, it was pretty steady, no bogeys on the card today.  I thought that I hit the ball pretty good and gave myself some decent chances.  I didn't really get it close enough, so it felt like I was putting from 15 to 25 feet on pretty much every hole and i managed to make a few.  Yeah, it was a good, solid round.   
 Q.  Early in the second round but you found yourself in good position, don't you.  
PETER HANSON: Yeah, steady.  Still got a bit of work to do with my game to get back but it's getting there and health is very good, so trying to get back in shape.  So everything is moving the right direction.   
 Q.  That's an important thing to say, the health is good, hasn't been for awhile, so nice to start 2016 feeling good.  
PETER HANSON: Yeah, it is.  The last bit of last year was actually pretty good and I've been able to practice very hard for the last six weeks, so that obviously helps.  Just makes you feel a bit more comfortable standing over the shots and over the putts.  Just try to build on it.   
Short game still needs a bit of work, chipping and pitching and I think my par 5 scoring average this week kind of shows that.  Only level par on the par 5s, so got a bit of improvement to do there.   
 Q.  Do you feel like it is a fresh start and you can really have a good go at the year?  
PETER HANSON: Yeah, it does.  I'm back running again.  The body holds up very well.  Lost quite a bit of weight over the nine, ten weeks that I had off.  So just going to keep working at it and try to slowly get back to where I want to be.
