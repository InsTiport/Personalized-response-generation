  Q. 6-under par through two rounds here, that's very good scoring; the course has not been easy.   
 PETER HANSON: No, it hasn't. It has the par 5s that are reasonably easy birdie opportunities, but so many difficult holes, as well.  
  
  Q. Have you enjoyed the tournaments following your win?  
 PETER HANSON: Definitely. Gleneagles was really good fun and I gave it everything I had to try to win and maybe get a pick. I know it was a long shot. But finishing third and playing well, so it's really nice.  
  
  Q. And does this course setup nicely for your eye?  
 PETER HANSON: I think so especially the way it's playing now, a lot of long irons and mid-irons into the greens and tight areas, so I think it suits me pretty well.  
  
  Q. Was The Ryder Cup on your mind at some point through the summer?  
 PETER HANSON: Not really because I was not playing good enough through the start of the season and up until July when the big tournaments came up ask and I started to play better but it was just a little bit too late.  
  
  Q. This would be a nice tournament to win, second of the year.   
 PETER HANSON: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball well and if you can make some putts here on these fantastic greens, you have a good chance.  
  
  Q. 6-under par at the halfway stage, what's a good total you would like to have on Sunday?  
 PETER HANSON: Depends on the weather.   
 Today it was a little bit tricky with the rain and the wind, but I would say double that, 12, 13, 14 and you're going to have a good chance.
