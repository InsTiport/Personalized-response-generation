   PETER HANSON:  Played really solid but a couple of bad lies made it a different score today. It felt better tee to green but that's golf. It is like Dubai where the front nine is hard and the back nine easier, and I think you will see the stroke average much less on the back nine here. It plays like that, with a lot of slopey greens. 
 It's trickier today with the breeze swirling around and there are some tricky up and downs. I am really happy with the way I played, though. I should have been 3 or 4 under today with a bit of luck but golf can be like that. 
 I got the most out of my round yesterday shooting six under par. It's a fine line between the good score and a bad score. The pins are all tricky here because the greens are so small and so slopey and it's tough. Some greens you can't find a flat spot, but that's the name of the game. If you shoot 10- or 11-under par here for the week you will have a chance.
