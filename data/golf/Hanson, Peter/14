  PETER HANSON:   You know, it was an average round of golf, but I putted really lights‑out, so it was one of those, I got the most out of the round I think.   It was a nice way to start, 5‑under around here. 

Q.   Seemed like scoring took awhile to get going for everybody?
PETER HANSON:   It did, but it was a great group to play in, playing with Dustin and Hunter, we all played well, and they started making a lot of birdies, and it always helps, no matter what people say.   It always helps when you see good golf and you see birdies, and you are trying to, I didn't play as good as they did early on, and just trying to hang in there and catch up and managed to do a nice‑‑ make a nice eagle on 10.   Hit a 3‑wood to, you know, four feet.   So really got my round going. 

Q.   Putt of the day? 
PETER HANSON:   I think, you know, I was trying to play it clever on 16, and hit 4‑iron off the tee, missed the fairway, and you're dead, short pin.   Left it short of the bunker where I'm not supposed to leave it, hit a good bunker shot to 20 feet and made that for 4.   One of those crucial‑‑ you walk off 16 with a 5 is really, really difficult for your head, but to make that putt, set up a good chance on 17.   And then 18 is 18; 4 is okay. 

Q.   Have you played with Dustin much? 
PETER HANSON:   A few times.   I wouldn't say a great deal, but we've played a bit.   We used to fly together.   We flew over from Dunhill together, so I feel that I know Dustin pretty good.   He's a great guy to play with, plays very fast.   Just a very comfortable guy and always relaxed and good guy to play with, especially the way he played today.   He should have been, you know, 6‑, 7‑, 8‑under par the way he played.
