  Q. 2-over par through two holes and 2-under at the end, how do you feel about your day?  
 PETER HANSON: Good. Of course it was playing very, very tough, especially on the way out. A lot of the holes were into the wind. 1-under for a return was okay and managed to pick up a couple of birdies on the way in.   
  
  Q. Describe the final hole, misjudged pitch?  
 PETER HANSON: Yeah, it's kind of hard. I've been missing that fairway left now three days in a row, so getting a bit annoyed with that. Chipped out a lob-wedge, but it almost made it all the way into the hazard. And just sometimes when you are on the downslope, just delofting the club a little bit and over hit it over the back of the green so, that was no good.   
  
  Q. You are renowned for your ball-striking and obviously that was a premium today. Did you look at today as an opportunity to make ground up?   
 PETER HANSON: Yeah, I've been happy the way I've been playing. Struggling a bit off the tee the first two rounds, and today I felt I hit it much better and iron play was good. Especially today when it was windy, I scrambled very well and made some really good putts, like the one on the last.  
  
  Q. You have your locker from The Ryder Cup and obviously those huge pictures; are they inspiring you?  
 PETER HANSON: Definitely, walking in the hotel or up in the clubhouse, it brings back a lot of great memories.   
  
  Q. Goals for this season, is winning one of them?  
 PETER HANSON: Absolutely. I was lucky enough to win twice last year, and want to do it again this year.
