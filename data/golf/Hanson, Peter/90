  Q.  A big finish?   
 PETER HANSON:  Yes, I needed that up and down at the last was very important for third place. To birdie these last two holes was very pleasing. I felt I did well to hit all 18 greens and when you are putting for birdie on every hole it's difficult. I didn't make enough on the front nine.   
When you finish like that you can't be unhappy, though. I was pleased with the way I played in a great field and head to head with Harrington and Jimenéz. I noticed after about 12 holes that he was flying and he must have been six or seven under par after 12 holes. It didn't really happen for me after that, although I tried my hardest. It was a good week all round.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It was a poor start. I suffered with my focus. I bogeyed two holes on the back nine and that doesn't happen too often. Such is the game. Always disappointing when you have a chance but I still feel I am well ahead of expectation for this time of year.   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENÉZ:  I had a very good chance but I hit a very bad shot at the 17th. I missed the shot and no excuse. I played good enough golf to win today, certainly to get a play-off and I still felt on the 18th that I had a chance of a play-off and a victory. I am very disappointed about the last few holes but I am very happy with my game in general. It is only three weeks into January.
