 Q.  Fantastic round of golf, highlighted by the hole-in-one on three?  
PETER HANSON: Obviously that was a great start, to get a bonus like that on the third hole and managed to keep it going with a birdie on 4.  Yeah, the round was good.  I played solid and took advantage of the par 5s.  So good day.   
 Q.  Fairly benign conditions it seems today.  Is this the easiest it's played over the three days?  
PETER HANSON: I think definitely easier than yesterday.  Yesterday we had a bit more wind.  But like I said, moving day is a day you go out there and try to play aggressive and go at maybe a few more pins than I did yesterday, when you are kind of fighting to make the cut coming down the stretch.  It's nice, always a nice feeling to go out there and go straight at it and try to make birdies.   
 Q.  In these Rolex Series events, big prize money and points up for grabs.  
PETER HANSON: Yeah, it's nice.  Obviously these are the big weeks.  With Rolex Series coming into play, it's massive to get a day like this, and maybe not be in contention for tomorrow but somewhere up there, and hopefully a good round tomorrow can give us a really good cheque.   
 Q.  What's pleased you most about the game this week?  
PETER HANSON: I've actually been starting to putt a little better.  First day I putted really well and game is feeling pretty about.  Driving it good which is key here, keep it in the fairway and made a few putts.  Overall, pretty happy.
