PETER HANSON: Very pleased, especially the way I played in the afternoon to shoot a 65. Had a decent 70 this morning but didn't play that great. We had dead calm conditions in the morning and the last two three holes, it picked up a bit but it was still good conditions for us.
Q.  What was the key?
PETER HANSON:  It's a pretty open course. You are going to hit a lot of greens. You have to make a lot of putts to make it to nine or 10 under par. I feel very good, just striking the ball very nice. I'm just trying to keep my momentum going and keep my focus on this tournament and not think too much of what I did last week in Spain. I had a couple of beers in the evening to celebrate last Sunday but we were home at 1am at night and had a flight down here.
Q. Talk a bit about yesterday?
PETER HANSON:  I was just hanging around here for six hours. But I'm on the good side of the draw and I'm happy with that. The guys who played had some bad conditions. I had to wake up at 5 this morning to play two rounds but it was fine. Just a 13-hour day today.  Made a few putts out there in the afternoon. At least I'll have a lie-in tomorrow morning.
