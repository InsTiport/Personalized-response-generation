  PETER HANSON: It comes down to putting. To be honest I played all right the first two days, but just didn't hole anything. Today, they all seemed to go in.   
  
  Q. You shot 2-under for the last four holes, but those four holes are ranking in the six most difficult on the course. Is that the way they felt, or could you see why they are playing difficult?  
 PETER HANSON: 17 is really tough today with that pin on the right. And 16, a lot of things can happen. You can see big numbers coming up 18 like we saw yesterday, as well.   
 So I mean, of course, I'm very pleased to get away with such a great finish.   
  
  Q. This is a huge week for you, 54th in the World Rankings, currently in 15th place in The Race to Dubai; if you can get in the Top 15 or stay into the Top 15, you'll get in three majors next year. How much are you feeling that?  
 PETER HANSON: Quite a lot. I mean, I have to say, I know what it's all about. Like you said, this week. So maybe that had a bit to do with the first two days.   
 It get good out there today but maybe a bit more relaxed, so hopefully I can stay that way tomorrow.
