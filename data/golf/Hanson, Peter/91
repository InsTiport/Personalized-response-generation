 Q.  Nice sequence - 70, 68 and now 66. It looked as if you were enjoying yourself? 
 PETER HANSON:  Yes, very much. I was happy yesterday and even better today. 

 Q.  A nice run of events. Have you been preparing hard for this run? 
 PETER HANSON:  Yes, I was over in Dubai last week for practised with my coach for six days. They take really good care of us at the Emirates and I am looking forward to coming back there in a couple of weeks' time. 

 Q.  Were watching leaderboards? 
 PETER HANSON:  No, I wasn't paying attention. I saw Harrington and Miguel were there. I probably need another 6- or 7-under par tomorrow to have a chance of winning. It would be great if I could keep the sequence going of lowering my score by two shots every day. I would take a 64 tomorrow! 

 Q.  Are you playing all three weeks? 
 PETER HANSON:  Yes. That is the plan then take a couple of weeks off. I stayed with Joakim Haeggman last week in Dubai to practice. With Henrik Stenson and Johan Edfors also living here, it is becoming a bit of a Swedish camp! 

 Q.  Did you take a break? 
 PETER HANSON:  I really had five weeks off. We had a baby girl on the second of January. It's our first. Sanna and I have called her Stella. Maybe I am flying a little bit at the moment. They are coming down next week. I left home and she was only one and a half weeks old and I've been walking on the clouds since then. It feels wonderful and it would be great to win for her.
