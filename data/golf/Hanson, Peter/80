 Q. How does it feel to beat your friend and the European Number One?
 PETER HANSON: It feels pretty good. Even if we are good friends it is match play and always nice to win.

 Q. Did you feel in control all the way?
 PETER HANSON: I wouldn't say that but I got off to the better start and was three up at the turn and just played sensibly on the way back in. 

 Q. Was there any sense of the form needed to beat Robert today?
 PETER HANSON: Hard to say as I have had three weeks off since Dubai and have been practising in Orlando for two weeks. It is hard to know where you are but I was happy with my game. It was not the best of rounds and I need to find something better for tomorrow.

 Q. Does the altitude have much effect?
 PETER HANSON: It can do especially now when it is really hot as it goes even further. The course is actually playing quite short even though it is 7800 yards.
