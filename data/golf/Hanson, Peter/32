Q.   Peter, you gave it your best shot, you came up short but you have to be delighted with your week's work?
PETER HANSON:   A good week's work, and it was fun to play with Justin.   Played very well.   I felt on the back nine, if I could stay close to him I was going to get close.   3‑putted 13 from maybe 30 feet, that kind of killed my round a little bit.   He made a nice birdie on 14 and I made bogey.   So instead of being one or two behind, all of a sudden I saw myself five behind and I'm running out of holes.   But it was nice to get the birdie on 16 and played pretty solid on the way in. 

Q.   Must be a lot of positives, as well, second to last in a WGC, what you play the game for?
PETER HANSON:   To be honest, it's a little new to me, being on Tour for so long.   But the last two World Golf Championships, I really felt like I kept up with the big boys a little bit more and nice to be up there. 

Q.   Gives you great confidence going into the Masters? 
PETER HANSON:   It does.   Having a few more weeks of playing over here, play Tampa and I'll play Houston as a preparation for Augusta.   I need to fine tune a little bit on the short game before Augusta. 


Q.   Have you got a decent record there at Augusta? 
PETER HANSON:   No, I haven't really.   I struggled a little bit‑‑ last year I was struggling with the short stick, so now I feel that I roll the ball so much better, and I think it showed this week, even though I wasn't 100 percent off the tee.   I still managed to make some good putts and hang in there. 

Q.   Gained a lot of Ryder Cup points this week, as well?
PETER HANSON:   These weeks are key and if you play a little bit more over here, as well, each week will count double, there's massive Ryder Cup points over in Europe so you have to play well these weeks.
