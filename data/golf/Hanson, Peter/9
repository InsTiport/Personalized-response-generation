  PETER HANSON:   It was nice, to make two long putts coming down the stretch, it obviously feels great, putter was working nice all day today, and yesterday, so I need to strike it a little bit better.   I'm still hitting it a little bit off centre of the club, so an hour of practice and then be ready to go for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Certainly have seen signs that you were going to do in Abu Dhabi what you've done from so often and come off the pace, game looked good?  
PETER HANSON:   Getting there.   Like I said it's slightly off and I'm quite a bit behind distanceâ€‘wise, probably come from the back injury last year and still have a bit of work to do physically to get back in shape.   
But I've been scrambling really nice, 24 putts today, and I think had pretty similar numbers yesterday.   That always helps the score.  
   
 Q.   How is the back, what treatment are you getting?   
PETER HANSON:   Feeling great.   Obviously a lot of rehab and gym work to try to get it better from the stage it is now, but 100 percent pain free for 2 1/2 months.   All good fun.  
   
 Q.   Gym work easy?   
PETER HANSON:   No, I've always loved being in the gyms.   It was actually quite hard last year when I wouldn't move very well and couldn't spend as much time in the gym.   So feeling a little bit weaker and I was probably 20 yards behind Ernie and Martin, but I would probably be normally up to the same length, so I've got a bit of work to do.
