JIM AHERN:  I played pretty good, only had one bogey, made a nice par save on -- I don't know what hole it was -- 6, maybe.  And then missed the green there on 8.  I had the right club, I just didn't hit it very good, it plugged in the bottom of the trap, kind of surprised me.  But I played pretty good.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
JIM AHERN:  Yeah, there's a lot of fade holes there.  I've loved the course since I first played it.  A lot of those holes look good to me, if I can just keep it in the fairway.  I seem to get kind of lucky, when I did miss the fairway, I had a decent line most of the time.  I'm pretty fortunate there.  Graham missed the fairway there, and couldn't hardly get it out the last hole.

Q.  Is it a relief to get the first round out of the way?
JIM AHERN:  I think they all feel that way.  Major or not.  But the answer is yes, it's nice to get a good round, get off to a good start and not feel like you're behind the 8 ball.

Q.  What do you think of that 64 that Eaks put up?
JIM AHERN:  That's fabulous.  I tell you what, I know Bobby is a good player, I've known him for a long time, but that's a low score today.  I don't think anybody -- I don't know what is next best, I haven't looked, but it's a great score.

Q.  What in your game will you change for tomorrow's round?
JIM AHERN:  It kind of depends on how I feel.  It was kind of touch and go if I'd play today.  I pulled a rib in my back, and this time yesterday the odds were not in favor of me playing.  So, it just depends on how I feel.  You need to keep the ball in the fairway and get it on the green.
