  Q. What did you think out there today?
 HUNTER WOLCOTT:   I had a good time.  You know, we kind of just wanted to have fun.  We were anxious the past couple days to just get going.  We had a good game plan and got off to a good start.  Short game was kind of there all day and ended up shooting a good number.
 Q. Did your dad ever play in the Am?
 HUNTER WOLCOTT:   Yes, sir, dad and older brother.
 Q. What was the thought going into this?
 HUNTER WOLCOTT:   No thought except I play week in, week out with these guys and know I'm good enough to play with them, know I'm good enough to compete and win here, so I just wanted to put my head down and show people how good I really am.
 Q. Your thoughts going into tomorrow?
 HUNTER WOLCOTT:   Just kind of keep it going.  We've got a good game plan.  We'll sit down and look at the pins for tomorrow, spend some time later in the day and kind of just keep it going.
