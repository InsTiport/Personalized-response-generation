 Q.   How cold was it this morning?  
TAG RIDINGS:   It was freezing.   I'm underâ€‘packed this week obviously.   But I think the late tee time, I'll be all right now.  
   
 Q.   Are you telling me you didn't have anything with sleeves this morning?  
TAG RIDINGS:   No sleeves.   I had a short rain vest that really wasn't warm enough.   But I got it done on the first couple of holes, and after about six holes I was okay.  
   
 Q.   A few birdies warms things up for you.   
TAG RIDINGS:   They do.   It took me a while to make, one but my guys were making them in the group so I knew they were available.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you had to know that it was going to be tough out there with the wind blowing, the cold conditions.   How pleased are you with 68?   
TAG RIDINGS:   I'm very pleased.   The greens, they sped up and the wind is drying them out.   The little rye that's on them isn't really slowing things down.  
   
 Q.   I thought from the looks of the weather, you guys might have got the short end of the stick, the wind is supposed to calm down and be nice the rest of the week.   In other words, the other of half of the field is not going to get that cold morning tomorrow that you guys got today.   Did that play into your thinking, knowing that you needed a good one?  
TAG RIDINGS:   You know, I didn't think about them getting away with one tomorrow, but it happens a lot out here.   You just take the punches when you get them.   
   
 Q.   How's your game right now?   It's been on and off so far this year?  
TAG RIDINGS:   It's been, yeah, a lot off, but minor details, like if you aim where you want it to go, it helps.   I've started doing that today and it seemed to help.  
   
 Q.   How many years have you been on TOUR now, 12?   
TAG RIDINGS:   I don't know, keep doing the same thing.
