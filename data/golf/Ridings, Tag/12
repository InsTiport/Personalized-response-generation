 Q. Tag, you had four birdies, an eagle, two bogeys, shooting a 66, 4-under par. Are you happy with the round?
 TAG RIDINGS: I am. It's been a while since I've had a good round out here, getting under par by more than one or two. I'm looking forward to this, and it was nice to hole the eagle. That was beautiful.

 Q. What's different about this round when you said it's been a while since you've shot that kind of number? What changed today?
 TAG RIDINGS: I haven't been putting that well this year, and today things were going in that should have gone in. I missed a little one, but I hit a good putt and it kind of bounced off line. But for the most part all the putts I hit were just like I wanted to hit them, and I made a lot of them.

 Q. Positive mindset going into the rest of the week? Feel like you can keep this going? 
 TAG RIDINGS: Absolutely. If I keep the ball-striking where it needs to be, I'll be right there in the end.
