 Q. Just comments on your round today. 
 TAG RIDINGS: Nice pitch in and a nice birdie on 14 from left of the hazard. Prior to that, just a couple good up and downs. 
 11 was a 70-footer two-putt. 12, got it up-and-down from the front left bunker, so that was the turnaround. Couple bogeys at front and then we just got it going and birdied the last hole. So really wasn't anything to it. I just putted well and hung in there.

 Q. Talk a little bit about the conditions we've had these first two days?
 TAG RIDINGS: It's been as hard a conditions as we've had all year, and as hard as we ever see normally. This is a good test.

 Q. And you're right there heading into the weekend. Just your thoughts on the weekend. 
 TAG RIDINGS: Yeah, I need to have a good weekend and see if I can get in contention on the last few holes on Sunday and have a chance at them. I'm kind of due for one, so let's hang in there. 

 Q. You were saying that the conditions changed drastically from the morning to the afternoon. How drastic was it and how much difficult was it on the first nine holes?
 TAG RIDINGS: Well, I would say the first nine holes it was quite a bit cooler than the back nine. (Inaudible) It's a good test of golf right now.

 Q. You're 152nd on the Money List on the PGA Tour. These six weeks are obviously very big for you. This week in particular, how important is it for you to get this good weekend out of the way to free yourself up for the next five weeks?
 TAG RIDINGS: Well, that's very important. I haven't won out here yet. I have a good shot at it. I've been in position several times going into the weekend, and I'd like to get a good shot at it this time.
