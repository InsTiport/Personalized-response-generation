 Q. Still playing tough out there? 
 TAG RIDINGS: It's a nice golf course and makes you pay attention all the day long. Can't ask for anything more than.

 Q. How do you like what you did? Anytime you're under par, you're happy with that. 2-under, 68.
 TAG RIDINGS: I'm extremely happy. It feels like the lowest round I've ever shot on this course. I may have tied it before. I don't think I ever beat it.

 Q. How do you build on this for tomorrow, just try to do the same thing?
 TAG RIDINGS: Yeah, yeah. Hit a lot of fairways, hit it really good and I made some putts. If I can do that and eliminate one goofy mistake I made, then, you know, it will be one swing under. All you can do is take one at a time.

 Q. The conditions change during the round. How much did it change?
 TAG RIDINGS: The wind picked up and moved from south to west. That's changed quite a bit on a few holes coming in. It will be different for this afternoon. I think it's supposed to move to northwest, so that will flip a lot of holes backwards from where they were this morning. That's a pretty good change right there.

 Q. Different from yesterday. It's been like different every 12 hours.
 TAG RIDINGS: Yeah. Yeah. That's part of the gig, right?
