 Q.  Two rounds in the 60's to get things started.  Talk about it, shocker? 
 TAG RIDINGS:  Shocker, yeah. 

 Q.  To you a shocker? 
 TAG RIDINGS:  It's been a while.  It's good to see though. 

 Q.  You have had the whole four weeks off of the playoffs.  You haven't played since Wyndham.  What did you do with the time off? 
 TAG RIDINGS:  I played.  I went to the Nationwide Tour.  Played quite a few events there.  Kind of not very high on either money list, so trying to get myself in position to get a card back one way or another. 
 So hopefully this week will get me in that position out here. 

 Q.  This is the way you want to make it is on top of this tour? 
 TAG RIDINGS:  Yeah, pays better. 

 Q.  Talk about your game.  You've only had three bogies, I think.  This golf course can be had if you put it on the fairways? 
 TAG RIDINGS:  That's just it.  I've been driving the ball a lot better this week.  Hit a lot of 3-woods off the tee. 
 The wind has helped.  We haven't had to hit a lot of drivers, but when I have had to, I've hit it pretty well.  And the putting has been really good this week. 

 Q.  Are you going to play as many of these final seven of the Fall Series as you need to? 
 TAG RIDINGS:  Very likely.  Depending on which ones I get in, I'll probably get in 5 out of 7.  So I'll probably just stick it out. 

 Q.  All right, great playing today.
