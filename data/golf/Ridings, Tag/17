Q.  Is it like any other tournament when a guy is on top

TAG RIDINGS:  No, that happens a lot.  But, you know, I'm just having a chance to chase him down and obviously he's got it in hand.
Q.  Have you been paired with Tiger in competition, and if you have, was playing with Camilo about the same thing?

TAG RIDINGS:  I haven't played with Tiger since college, but yeah, very similar, actually.  Tiger has probably gone upwards in terms of status and playing with him is probably tougher now than it was then.

But playing with Camilo, the crowd was very similar.
Q.  What did this week do for you?

TAG RIDINGS:  It got me into Bay Hill.  It got me up there moving upwards on the Money List, which takes a little heat off me, too.
Q.  What kind of progress did you see in your game this week?

TAG RIDINGS:  Putting progress, it helps that I know these greens very well, but I haven't been making anything.  I made a few this week which helps my confidence going on down the line.
Q.  What do you think about Camilo Villegas?

TAG RIDINGS:  Incredible talent, great guy, fun to play with, Florida Gators, I won't hold that too much against him.  He was great to play with.
