  Q. Good playing today.  You're right there in the mix.  I thought it was really good.  Middle of the round there, the scoring holes at 14 and 15 when you didn't make birdies, looked like you kept your composure really well.
 KRISTOFFER VENTURA:   Yeah, I mean, that's something I've worked on, and it's definitely paid out.  Today I just had to stay patient.  I didn't make as many putts as I normally do, so it was nice to drop one on the last and finish in style.
 Q. Did the golf course -- obviously it was soft early in the week and you haven't had any rain, had a little bit of breeze.  Has it changed any?  Has it gotten a little firmer, greens a little harder?
 KRISTOFFER VENTURA:   I mean, these greens are probably the best greens that I've putted on ever.  They're fast, they're kind of firm, but they're just so pure that you can see if you made a putt 10 feet out or six feet out.  But no, the course has been playing a little soft.  It would be nice if the fairways were a little firmer.  But overall this is one of the best courses I've played, and it certainly fits my game.
 Q. As you head into the final round, anything you're thinking about, or how do you approach tomorrow's round?
 KRISTOFFER VENTURA:   I mean, like everyone just says, just one shot at a time.  For me it's just more mental.  If I just do my absolute best, that's all I can do, and I can sleep good at night no matter what happens tomorrow.  That's the way I've approached my game the last few months, and it's definitely paying off.
