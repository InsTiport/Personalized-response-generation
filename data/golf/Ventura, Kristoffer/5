Q. Tell me about playing against your college teammate today.  What kind of feeling was that out there?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: It was interesting.  I didn't know what to expect.  I've played with him and against him a bunch of times, so I just treated it like another round.  (Wind interference.)
So I came out on top, but I still he thought he played great.  (Wind) It was impressive.  Yeah, just treated it like another match.
Q. This was your first USGA Championship.
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: Yep.
Q. What was your expectation coming in here?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: First of all, Riviera, I mean, I've heard a bunch of good things about the course.  This is amazing.
For the tournament, I've played a bunch of British Amateurs, and this is way better.  I mean, it's a big tournament, the British Amateur is, but this feels like a U.S. Open for amateurs.  That's the kind of feel that I get.
Q. You got to the round of 16 this year, right?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: Yeah.
Q. Did that give you some confidence going into this?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: It did.  It did.  I played a budge of the match play representing Norway tournaments in Europe, and then I played a bunch of other tournaments on the British Amateur.
I mean, I play matches against my buddies all the time.  So, yeah, I feel like I'm a good match play player.  Yeah, I mean, last couple days I've played some really good golf.
Q. Was the key getting out to an early lead today?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: You know, I wasn't really planning on I want to get to an early lead or whatever.  I was just playing my own game.
I figured if I didn't make any bogeys, if I just made easy pars, and then had some good looks and putts to win holes, then I was going to give him a good run.
Q. Birdie the 3rd hole, right?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: Yes, I think.  Yes.
Q. How did you do it?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: I hit, what was it, 3-wood barely in the rough right.  I hit a wedge to 25 feet and made the putt.
He hit a little right (wind) to chip out and he was in a bit of trouble.  I was just trying to put good speed on the putt and give it a chance.
Q. And then maybe one of the best shots of the day was the chip in for eagle on 10?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: Yeah, that was incredible, but that was fun.
Q. How far did you have?  What club did you use?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: You mean the chip?
Q. Uh-huh.
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: Was about 20 yards maybe just short.  I had to hit it like just left of the bunker.  But I knew it was going to be fast, so I had to get it up in the air with some spin.
And just to see it go in, I mean, it was a good shot.  I saw there was a camera there, and one of my friends from Norway took a video, so that was lucky.
Q. What club did you use?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: I used a 60-degree.
Q. So you're feeling good heading into the round of 16 here, too?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: Yeah.  I know, I mean, just kind of play the way I've been playing and whatever happens, happens.
Q. Have you played with or against Connor Syme before?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: I've played with him a few times.  I know him pretty good.  We played some tournaments in Europe together.  Yeah, so I've known him for a little bit and he's a good player, so...
Q. So you know what to expect this afternoon?
KRISTOFFER VENTURA: Yeah, obviously.  I mean, it doesn't matter what player it is.  You just got to play good and do your own thing.  Hopefully I'll come out on at the end of the day.
