  Q. Talk about the ace on 14.  Walk us through it if you could, please.
 KRISTOFFER VENTURA:   I hit a great shot and it just happened to go in.  It took awhile for the ball to go in and then when the crowd went crazy that's when we knew.
 Q. Was it kind of cool to make a hole-in-one, now that the crowds are kind of back, to have that excitement?
 KRISTOFFER VENTURA:   Yeah, I mean it's my first one ever -- or on TOUR, at least, in a tournament.  So, yeah, it was pretty cool.
 Q. What club did you hit?
 KRISTOFFER VENTURA:   6-iron.
 Q. How cool that Mastercard is going to donate the $200,000 to the Arnold & Winnie Palmer Foundation?
 KRISTOFFER VENTURA:   That's great.  That's awesome.  That's probably the only thing that was really good about my round today and that's, I mean that's a lot of money, so that's very exciting.
