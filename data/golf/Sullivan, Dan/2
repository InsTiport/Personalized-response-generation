 Q.  Didn't probably go quite the way you drew it up.  
DAN SULLIVAN: That's a gross understatement.   
 Q.  Obviously.  Just not a lot of the putts falling?  
DAN SULLIVAN: I couldn't do anything right.  I think I made six or seven bogeys and just gave away hole after hole.   
Really didn't make him work for it but maybe a couple holes, which is really, really disappointing.   
I mean, last year I felt like I at least gave it a good go.  Today I just had nothing.   
 Q.  Compared to this morning when you said you...  
DAN SULLIVAN: Yeah, I missed one shot this morning, and I'm not sure I hit one good shot this afternoon.   
So, you know, that's how it goes.   
 Q.  Got to be frustrating.  You climb the mountain this far two years in a row.  
DAN SULLIVAN: It's unbelievably frustrating.  I can't tell how frustrated I am right now.  It's frustrating, and more than that, disappointing.   
It's one thing if you get beat, and I just gave it away.  Like I said, missing a four-foot-putt to lose the match is about the weakest way to go out.   
But Matt played very solid.  He's a great player.  Got a lot of the game.  He did what he had to do, which is make it hard for me to do anything other than just give holes away.   
 Q.  I know you're in great shape, but it's a lot of golf.  You think fatigue had anything to do with it?  
DAN SULLIVAN: I don't.  Last year I did.  Last year after I finished I looked back and felt like some of the shots I hit down the stretch were fatigue.   
This afternoon was just poor golf.  I had no game.  I was missing everything left.  I had this happen at times during the week and I either got away with it or I was able to kind of get it back on track.   
Today just completely fell apart.
