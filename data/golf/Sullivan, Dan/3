 Q.  Obviously you were down early in this match and you made a rally at second nine.  What turned it around?  
DAN SULLIVAN: Putting.  I finally was -- I was hitting the ball terrible.  I was hitting it left and missing greens and missing putts and just getting frustrated.   
Finally I was like, If I'm going down, I'm going down swinging.  I started to be very firm with my putts and banged in the last four on 15, 16, 17, 18.  It really started on the Par 3, 13, for birdie.  Then I was just like, I'm just going to be aggressive with my putting.   
 Q.  How long was the putt on 13?  
DAN SULLIVAN: Probably 12 to 13 feet.  It was on the top level and it was pretty straight, so I thought if I got it started online, gave it a good firm (indiscernible) it was going to go in.   
 Q.  How about a 50-year-old guy in the round of 16.  It can be done.  
DAN SULLIVAN: Happy to be here.  Having a good time.  It's a lot of fun playing in this tournament and doing well.  It's nice to see what you're made of.   
Finishing up the match the way I did, it really makes me happy to have done that.   
 Q.  Gives you a nice taste for this afternoon.  
DAN SULLIVAN: Yeah, absolutely, especially because I was struggling so much early.  To kind of dig myself out of it really is satisfying.   
 Q.  You beat the guy that knocked out Stewart, so...  
DAN SULLIVAN: I was aware of that, too.
