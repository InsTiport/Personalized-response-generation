Q. Obviously coming off last year's result, a good start this week.
TOM GILLIS: Yeah, two 64s in a row on this course.  I didn't expect it because I haven't done a whole lot this year to be quite honest with you.  I don't know, I feel really comfortable here, and I've got a lot of good feelings.  I don't know, for some reason, at least the last two minds, I've been really quiet in the mind.
Q. Eight birdies, just one bogey.  Obviously you had to stop and start yesterday, rainy and wet yesterday, but how was it today?
TOM GILLIS: Well, it's wet.  Fortunately we'll have a ball in our hand for the second round.  Finishing up is going to be tough for some of these guys.  There's a lot of casual water, so finding the relief is going to be tough.  But I actually thought it was a little drier than what I was expecting.  Yeah, it's going to play longer, but you're going to be able to take dead aim.
