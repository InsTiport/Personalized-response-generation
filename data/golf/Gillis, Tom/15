 Q. Top-10, a year ago here, Top-5 this year; you're getting closer and closer?
 TOM GILLIS: Yeah, it was a good week. I played good all week, I really did play solid. I had a bunch of chances early, and I didn't get any to go and I never really got any momentum early in the round today to really be a threat. 
 So all in all I'm happy and just pack the car up and go to L.A. and see if we can get another shot at it next Sunday.

 Q. Do you think you moved up the ladder shooting 70 on Sunday here?
 TOM GILLIS: Well, you would think you would. I don't know what I started at, but I might have started at fourth place, too. But I knew with the guys behind me, Phil and Hunter were probably going to play well. 
 So, you know, you can only do what you can do. You go out there and just try to hit the shots and convert and I think I may be missed one or two greens all day, so I played good. 
 I would like to make some putts, but it's a great golf course and I'm really looking forward to it.
