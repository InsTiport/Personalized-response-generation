 Q.   Well played out there, 4‑under par 66.   Really had it going but a couple of lip‑outs there at 6 and 7.   Is that just the poa annua greens?  
TOM GILLIS:   Probably not.   I think I just‑‑ the one I just hit‑‑ you know, I hit too hard going on I think it was 6 and then on 7 I just pulled it.   
I think they were fine.   I made a couple of 35‑footers, 40‑footers, so I guess it all evens out.   What are you going to do.  
   
 Q.   Seven birdies out there today.   You have to feel pretty comfortable on this golf course.   
TOM GILLIS:   Yeah, well, I started out on 10, hit it right out of bounds on the first hole.   After everything that went on there and shoot 4‑under, yeah, I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   As you head into the weekend, any thoughts?  
TOM GILLIS:   Not really.   Pretty much just go about what I've been doing, just keep playing and we'll see how it shakes out.
