 Q. Talk a little bit about how you've gotten to here from where you were ready to hang up your clubs a few years ago. 
 TOM GILLIS: Well, I think at 38 years old I didn't have any status anywhere, and I played in Europe, played a couple of years over here on this Tour, so it took a lot of commitment. I sat around for three months in winter in Michigan in '07 trying to decide what I wanted to do and decide if I had the commitment level to come back with no status. Three months of winter up there, that kind of made it a little easier for me. So yeah, I'm just proud of what I've been through and hopefully it gives some strength to other players that have fallen on hard times.

 Q. You don't have a logo on your hat and that's kind of unusual out here on the PGA TOUR. What about next week? I imagine Tom Gillis is a little more desirable than he was a week ago. 
 TOM GILLIS: Well, I hope so. We're working on a couple things, and being from Detroit there's some things I'd like to do up there, and hopefully they'll come together.
