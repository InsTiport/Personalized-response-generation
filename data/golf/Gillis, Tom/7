 Q.   Nice going out there, 2‑under par‑70 there, kind of keeping the momentum you gained during the finals for the Web.com TOUR.   
TOM GILLIS:   Yeah, that was kind of my goal all year after seeing the new structure last year.   I watched the guys that played well in the finals last year continue to play well in the fall, so when I did my schedule this year, I tried to schedule really, really light until right about now because I knew the finals we were going to play four and then we were going to play five out of six weeks in the fall, so I've been trying to get my game to peak at this time of year now, which I guess you would say is different maybe than in years past to some extent.  
   
 Q.   As you look at today's round, a little cooler temperatures this morning.   How did the golf course play out there?  
TOM GILLIS:   Well, it played long early, and with a few weeks off or a couple weeks off, I'd have to say we all were probably a little jittery, just because you've had a little bit of time off.   But the good thing is we got on those smooth poa annua greens in the morning and that makes a difference because they're good greens but they're a little soft, and in the afternoon it's going to be tougher to hold that line.  
   
 Q.   You talked about those finals events.   How do you think that prepared you to start the season off so quickly?  
TOM GILLIS:   Well, I think it prepares you pretty good because the golf courses are good.   I would make the same comparison to the Kansas City Royals who have been playing playoff baseball for about the last two or three weeks, and then they get in, and they've played well.   I would say it's real similar to that.
