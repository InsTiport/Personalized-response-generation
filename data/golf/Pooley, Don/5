DON POOLEY:  I played solidly for 14 holes and hit a good drive on 15, and then hit a bad 4-iron into a bunker on my second shot and didn't get it up and down and made bogey. I'm happy being right where I am, but man, I'm not happy with my finish. I made little mistakes on each of those holes at the end where I made bogeys and it cost me. I was just a little off here and there.

I'm still right there though. It was a very tough day to make birdies; every hole is playing very difficult. The wind was very difficult and it was even tougher out there today than yesterday. It was a struggle just to make par.

No. 5, sand wedge, 15-foot putt.

No. 9, chip to 2-feet.

No. 6 -- missed left and didn't get up and down.

No. 15 -- poor 4-iron into bunker and didn't get up and down.

No. 16 -- 3 wood, chip to 5-feet and misses putt

No. 18 -- Missed 12-foot putt.
