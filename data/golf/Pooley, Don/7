DON POOLEY:  I did a few things right today, especially in the middle of my round when I went eagle-eagle-birdie on holes 9-11. I can't remember the last time I had consecutive eagles in a tournament. It was a nice comeback, especially after the way I started out with bogeys on three of the first four holes.


The wind was difficult all day and par was a good score on any hole.


There's disaster all over out there. You need to miss it in the right spot. If you don't, it's dangerous and makes it a real struggle.


Eagle on 9, I hit 3-wood to 35 feet

Eagle on 10, I hit 3-wood to 20 feet

Birdie on 11, 9-iron to 10 feet
