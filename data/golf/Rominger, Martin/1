  Q.  I followed you at the turn.  You were 4-under and you went par, par, par, and then like you said, you hit the bogey train, huh?  Will you walk us through that part of it?  What happened in that stretch there?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  My first bogey came on 13.  That's a really easy hole, actually, and I hit it long over the green.  I took the wrong club.  I just hit it a bit too hard downwind, and then from back there it's hard to get it up-and-down.  I hit it a bit too long and missed the putt.   
 On the next one, I should have hit 4-iron as my second shot and I hit 5 and I ended up short, didn't get it up-and-down, same thing.   
 Next one, 15, I hit it in the trap, and from there I didn't get it on the green, didn't get it up-and-down again.   
 And then 17, I'm not really aiming for the pin anyway, so I'm aiming to the right side of the green or even further right, the wind pushed it, so I didn't get that one, either.   
  
  Q.  You were the first Swiss to make the cut on the PGA TOUR; is that correct?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Yes.   
  
  Q.  What are your thoughts about that?  Congratulations.   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Well, thank you.  I'm very happy.  I was pleased I was able to play like I wanted to yesterday.  I had a good round -- actually my first round was good, too, I just didn't manage to make all the putts I wanted to.  But yeah, very happy.   
  
  Q.  Is it special because of the name of the tournament?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Yeah, it's very good.  I got invited by Zurich to come over here.   
  
  Q.  Sponsor's exemption?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Sponsor's exemption.  They wanted to have a Swiss guy playing in the tournament.  And I came -- I played already last year, the first time a Swiss person plays in a PGA TOUR event.   
  
  Q.  You played here last year?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Last year, yeah.  So this is my second time, and I'm glad that I was able to play like I wanted to.   
  
  Q.  To familiarize us, how many pro golfers do they have in Switzerland?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  There's not many.  We probably have four or five competing at -- playing on a pro level, on a Tour.  But no major Tour.  They're all smaller Tours.   
  
  Q.  So they're not on the European Tour or anything?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  There's nobody on the European Tour, no.   
  
  Q.  What Tour do you play on?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  I play on the Asian Tour.   
  
  Q.  What is your hometown?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  My hometown is Pontresina.   
  
  Q.  And how long have you been on the pro Tour?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Two years.  I turned professional two years ago, went to the University of South Carolina prior to that and got my Tour card right away in Asia and had to go to Q-school again this year and finished second at Q-school this year.  So I'm going to play the whole year again on the Asian Tour.  So this is just one event I'm over here.   
  
  Q.  Would you like some day to make it out on the PGA TOUR?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Yeah, that would be nice.  I would love --   
  
  Q.  That's your goal?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  I would love to come back here, play over here.  As I said, I went to college here.  I like the States a lot.  It's a great place.  The courses are really nice, the people are nice.  I like it here.   
  
  Q.  Where do you go next week?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  I would have a tournament in Beijing, but I'm not doing that.  I did that last year, played the tournament right after this event pretty much on the other side of the world, so it's too far away.  So I'm just going home, one week rest, and then I go to South Korea for the next event on the Asian Tour.   
  
  Q.  Do you play out of Switzerland, or what would you consider your home base?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  My home base was Singapore for the last few months.  I had an apartment there, traveled from there to the different locations in Asia.  But now I don't have anything anymore.   
  
  Q.  Will you try Q-school here in the fall, or are you going to try back on the European Tour?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  I don't know yet.  It all depends on how I'm doing, what my rankings are at that point, if I have any kind of status on the different Tours.  I don't know yet.  The season just started up.   
  
  Q.  Are you a popular person in Switzerland because of your golf status?  I mean, are you considered --   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  I don't know.  Golf is not that famous in Switzerland.  It's tough with the media and so on.  It's not very well covered.  But I'm hoping I can help it out a little bit, change that.  If I have a few more good results, then possibly, maybe get Switzerland more interested in golf, as well.   
  
  Q.  How many pro tournaments have you played in the States, last year and this year?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Yeah, two, yeah.   
  
  Q.  How did you do last year?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  Missed the cut.   
  
  Q.  How old are you?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  I'm 27.   
  
  Q.  How many years did you play at South Carolina, all four?   
 MARTIN ROMINGER:  All four years, yeah.  I came a little bit later to school because in Switzerland you go to school a different time.
