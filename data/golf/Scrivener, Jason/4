 Q.  2-under par 70 to close out the tournament in difficult conditions. Talk us through the round.  
JASON SCRIVENER: Got off to a really nice start which is key today. Around this golf course, it's nice to get a couple birdies under your belt, and played really nicely the rest of the round. Couldn't really get any putts to drop, and hung on the last few holes that were playing tricky.   
 Q.  The putt for par on 18, fantastic way to close out the tournaments, since it looks like this is going to get you into the DP World.  
JASON SCRIVENER: Yeah, massive. Big goal of mine at the start of the year was to get to Dubai. Pretty happy with that and looking forward to that.   
 Q.  What's pleased you most about the way you've performed over the course of this tournament?  
JASON SCRIVENER: I think just the fact that I was playing under pressure pretty much every day, and just hung in there and stuck to my game plan. Yeah, that's probably the biggest thing.   
 Q.  Obviously you can look forward to your first DP World tournament next week now. There's a bonus pool for the top five, so is that a goal or are you looking to enjoy the week?  
JASON SCRIVENER: To be honest I haven't had any time to really think about it. I haven't even got the flights booked. Yeah, just going to take it as it comes. Feel like I'm playing well enough to contend and yeah, just looking forward to it.
