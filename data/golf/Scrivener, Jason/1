  Q. Many, many congratulations, a fabulous round of 66 and a back nine of 29.  Brilliant for us to watch.  What was it like for to you do?
 JASON SCRIVENER:   Yeah, I don't know, I was in my own little world.  My caddie and I just kind of kept plodding away.  Wasn't a good start, made a few soft bogeys, and then just kind of stuck with it and yeah, 29 on the back, which was pretty nice.
 Q. Your caddie was telling me he had never seen you work this hard; Christmas Day was the only day you had off and you've been working with Dave Alred.  Tell us about that.
 JASON SCRIVENER:   Yeah, he's been a game changer for me.  Really taught me -- we sat down probably two months before Christmas at the end of my season last year, and he's really helped me a lot and pushed me that bit extra to work harder.
 Q. Tyrrell Hatton looks like he's got it under control; will you stick around?
 JASON SCRIVENER:   He looks pretty solid right now, but I'll wait around though.
