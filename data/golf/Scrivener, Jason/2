  Q. 7-under total, and 2-under 70 today, pleased with that?
 JASON SCRIVENER:   Yeah, it was hard work this afternoon.  Had to hole a few nice par putts to keep the round going but happy with it.
 Q. How much more difficult does it make the golf course when the wind picks up?
 JASON SCRIVENER:   We're just not really used to it around here.  Normally it's nice and warm the ball goes a mile but some of those holes are pretty long, so you kind of had to adjust as you went but it's a really good test.
 Q. Right in the mix now, Rolex Series Event, big weekend ahead for?
 JASON SCRIVENER:   Yeah, looking forward to it.  Put in a lot of work over the off-season and it's nice to see it pay off this early, and yeah we look forward to the weekend.
 Q. What are some of those things that you worked on?
 JASON SCRIVENER:   Just every part of my game really.  Just ramped up my practise schedule, and it's nice to see it pay off.
