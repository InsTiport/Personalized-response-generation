JASON SCRIVENER: Really happy with the way I played and happy to have a job next year.   
 Q.  Nice to finish birdie, birdie?  
JASON SCRIVENER: Yeah, I was just trying to play solid today.  I played really well all day.  I just didn't hole too many putts until the last two holes.  But happy with my round.   
 Q.  What was it like mentally?  
JASON SCRIVENER: I think the more times I can be under pressure and perform well, it's good.  After the up-and-down year it's been, highs and lows, but happy to go through.   
Love playing in Europe and I should be able to plan a schedule.  Haven't had that opportunity the last few years, so looking forward to that.
