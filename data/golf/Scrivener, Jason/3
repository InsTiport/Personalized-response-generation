Q. Opening round of 66 in Abu Dhabi. Your analysis of how you felt today went?
JASON SCRIVENER: It was pretty much stress-free. I played nicely the whole day. Didn't do too much wrong which is nice. Nice way to start the year.
Q. How did you find the weather evolve? When you made the turn, things were starting to change and the greens were starting to evolve?
JASON SCRIVENER: Yeah, they quickened up a little bit. Wind picked up a little bit but not much. It was still perfect conditions out there. I knew it was playing as easy as it's going to play, so wanted to take advantage of it. Nice way to start.
Q. Guys are talking about how tough it is to keep off -- well, in areas, the fairways are narrow and you have to make sure you're always in play. How much does that speak to your game today?
JASON SCRIVENER: Yeah, any time I was out of position, play for par and when I was in the fairway, I could play more aggressively. I think that's the way we'll try to play the rest of the week and stick with that plan.
Q. Guys from Australia, it's kind of the climate what you've grown up in?
JASON SCRIVENER: Yeah, I love it here. It's perfect, great conditions and great golf course.
Q. Tomorrow, different day obviously. Going to be a little bit different, maybe some wind as the week pushes on. How will you approach it?
JASON SCRIVENER: Hopefully the same as today. Yeah, just fairways and greens and hole a few putts. The greens are rolling really nicely, so definitely plenty of opportunities out there.
