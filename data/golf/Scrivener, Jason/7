 Q.   Your round today, what was it like playing in the challenging conditions?  
JASON SCRIVENER:   It was challenging, yeah.   It actually wasn't too bad because it softened up the greens quite a lot, slowed them up, so wasn't too bad.   The wind wasn't too bad.   It was just the rain was a little bit annoying.   I'm happy with it in the end, gives me a chance tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Being from Perth, is there extra pressure heading into the final round?  
JASON SCRIVENER:   I probably put a bit of pressure on myself at the start of the week but just told myself, you only put yourself under the pressure.   You put it on yourself.   
I think everyone just wants me to do well.   I don't think there's any pressure or any expectations.   I think they just want me to do well, so, it's nice.  
   
 Q.   Is it nice to see a couple of west Aussies out there?   
JASON SCRIVENER:   Yeah, it's great to see Brody up there.   I've played with Brody for years and he's so talented, so it's really good to see him up there.   And yeah, obviously a great round by Brett.   What was it, 7â€‘under or something?   That was really impressive.   Be good for the WA supporters and everyone here to get behind us.  
   
 Q.   And Brett Rumford, have you had the opportunity to play much with him?  
JASON SCRIVENER:   Not for a long time but a few years ago as an amateur I played with him, yeah.   Nice guy.
