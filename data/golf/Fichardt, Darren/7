Q.   At the halfway stage, that's not too shoddy, is it. 
DARREN FICHARDT:   Yeah, I would have taken it on Wednesday morning.   But today wasn't as good as yesterday.   Got a bit of work to do on the range.   Putting was good.   But no, I left a few out there.

Q.   Seems like an odd day, pins are tucked away and scores are not as prolific as perhaps it is was yesterday?
DARREN FICHARDT:   It's strange, this golf course, the prevailing wind almost helps you a bit.   The long holes, it helps shorten the long holes and makes the short putts holes a little easier to pitch into the greens being into the wind. 
But yeah, we are up for a good test on the weekend, so see what happens.   I'm two behind now, so it's not a bad place to be. 

Q.   What is it you're working on then this afternoon?
DARREN FICHARDT:   The same thing, just hit some soft cuts and then hopefully take it out on the golf course and be able to do it out there.
