  Q. 70 today, pretty good score under the circumstances with the wind?  
 DARREN FICHARDT: Yeah, the wind is brutal. Lucky they put a few tees up, and they didn't cut the greens this morning. So the greens are pretty slow, which was tricky with the chipping, because I left a couple of chips short and stuff. But yeah, they were definitely prepared for the wind.   
  
  Q. How pleased were you with the way you performed out there?   
 DARREN FICHARDT: The key thing here is you need to hit fairways. The rough is very thick, so that is my main goal. Even hitting 3-woods off the tee, keeping it in play from there, and to stop it on the green wasn't that tough because the greens not being cut. The greens are pretty soft.   
 And lucky the putter was good. So all in all, 70, I'm very happy.   
  
  Q. You've performed well here before. How tough was it compared to what you've known?   
 DARREN FICHARDT: Well, it's definitely a little harder than when I won in 2003. But it was very similar -- well, they had sandstorms and hopefully there's no sandstorms today. The wind was quite stiff. But it's definitely playing tougher. I mean, the rough is up, and, yeah, of course it's tight and you have to strike the ball well.   
  
  Q. How are you feeling about your own game?   
 DARREN FICHARDT: Feeling good. I haven't been on The European Tour the last two years, but I've been playing well and won five times back home and I've had like ten or 12 top fives last year.   
 So my game's been solid, recovered from injury, and just been playing solid. So just dig in there and keep playing and see what happens.
