 Q.  Considering you weren't even playing in this tournament at the start of the week, how do you assess things over the four days here?  
DARREN FICHARDT: Yeah, in shock.  I mean, yeah, come Wednesday evening, I was thinking I've got another two weeks off.  So it is definitely an awesome surprise to be playing and surreal, you know, it actually happened.  Pretty happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  You saved the best till last, as well, a final round 68.  What was the key to that out there?  
DARREN FICHARDT: I actually hit the ball really, really well today and played really, really well.  I just struggled to make some putts out there.  But I think I could have really shot a very low one today.   
But yeah, I did my best, and obviously trying to get into the DP World next week.  So let's hope it's enough.  We'll see what happens.   
 Q.  Where does this tournament rank for you on the schedule?  There's some big tournaments in South Africa now, the SA Open, the Joburg Open.  Where does this rank for you?  
DARREN FICHARDT: Well, slogan says it for itself; it's Africa's major.  South Africans always want to play in it, so it ranks pretty high.
