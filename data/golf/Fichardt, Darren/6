 Q.  What do you make of 7-under at the halfway stage?  
DARREN FICHARDT: I'm very happy at 7-under.  It's playing a lot easier today.  The wind wasn't blowing as hard, and the greens are rolling a lot better.  Definitely tough out there but I'm very happy with 7-under.   
 Q.  Does it feel like a different course today after the storms overnight?  
DARREN FICHARDT: No, it's playing pretty much the same.  There's no run on the fairways, and the greens are pretty soft.  So it's set up for some scoring.  You can fly it at the holes.   
But with the soft greens, there's a lot of heel prints and stuff like that.  So can tend to get a little frustrating out there, but yeah, I'm happy to be in the position I'm in.   
 Q.  You said yesterday about your attitude and determination to enjoy golf again.  Still enjoying it despite those heel marks?  
DARREN FICHARDT: No, definitely.  The greens are good.   
I'm definitely enjoying it a lot more.  I have a lot more feeling in my game and you know, you tend to get very technical in this game and it takes away a lot of your creativity, and obviously that affects your scoring.  I'm glad that's much better than it's been, especially the last couple years.  Take it into the weekend and see where it gets me.   
 Q.  So what was the most creative shot you had out there today?  
DARREN FICHARDT: Most creative shot, I had a few, quite a few.  But the one I really enjoyed was my second shot on 10.  I was in between, and I managed to hit this high pitching wedge, pitched past.  I had a good birdie there.   
No, pretty much the whole game is pretty good.  See where it gets me.
