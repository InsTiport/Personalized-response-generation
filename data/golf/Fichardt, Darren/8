  DARREN FICHARDT:   Obviously a great start.   This golf course seems to suit my eye so we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Well, it's hard to say, but what is it that suits your eye?   
DARREN FICHARDT:   It's variety.   It's not a monstrous golf course where you have to hit killer drive off the tee and a 3‑wood in for your second.   It's a very good layout.   Sometimes you hit iron off the tee, and other times, driver, 3‑wood, you know, it's a very nice, playable golf course.  
   
 Q.   Always good to be bogey‑free; all the more so in breezy conditions this morning?  
DARREN FICHARDT:   It's a little tougher this morning.   Obviously going to play a little tougher this afternoon, but just keep it on the fairway and on the greens and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Put it in context, if you would, because we haven't seen you right at the top for a little while.   
DARREN FICHARDT:   After I had my success in South Africa, I needed to make a few changes, just to get more consistent, and it's taken longer than expected.   But at BMW, I was playing pretty well, but I just couldn't make putts.   And then I got it going the last day at HSBC, putter was dead again.   But this week, the greens seem to suit my eye.  
   
 Q.   And you've seen the signs and you've seen the positive moves in your game?  
DARREN FICHARDT:   Definitely, it's always going to be a process.   So yeah, it's good to see it coming to.
