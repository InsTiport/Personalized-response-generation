 Q.   Just your experience on being in the Senior PGA Championship first off and then we'll talk about today.   
SHAWN KELLY:   Well, it's very exciting.   Very thrilled to be here.   I can't believe I'm a senior these days, but really fun, very exciting, great tournament, great field.   
   
 Q.   This is a golf course we all know it's going to be so demanding, people have to be patient, it's a segmented golf course, there's all different styles.   Have you ever seen anything like it?  
SHAWN KELLY:   I have not seen anything like it, but it's a very good golf course.   It's very nice what they have done here to revitalize the community and just a beautiful golf course.   It's spread out, but it is very fun when you get out there.  
   
 Q.   What do you think are the critical stretches that a player has to be very careful of before they go on to the back side?  
SHAWN KELLY:   I think that front side, 7, 8‑‑ 6, 7, 8 are pretty good holes in there.   That's a pretty good stretch.   
I think that there's a few holes on the back side, I think when you get to 13 that starts a couple good holes, you better be ready right there.  
   
 Q.   This is a chance for you to be among your friends from the club professional ranks and then to meet some of the guys that have been some of the great names in the past.   And that's quite a blend for you, isn't it?  
SHAWN KELLY:   It's a great blend.   It's good to see some old friends I haven't seen in a while.   And it's a nice blend and I'm enjoying it.
