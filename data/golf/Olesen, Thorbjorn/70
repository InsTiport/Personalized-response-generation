 Q.   Details on 18 if you don't mind, clubs, yardage?   
THORBJORN OLESEN:   I hit a 9‑iron for my second shot.   I had 145 meters, 160 yards, I guess.   
   
 Q.   How close?  
THORBJORN OLESEN:   I was probably 15 feet.   
   
 Q.   Do you think at the end of the day that's going to be good enough?  
THORBJORN OLESEN:   Not really, no.   I gave it my best today.   I hit a lot of great shots, but it's probably going to be a couple too much.   But I had the chances to make it, but I didn't take them.   
   
 Q.   What happened yesterday?  
THORBJORN OLESEN:   I played some great golf yesterday, especially on the front nine, and hit so many good shots.   But these greens are tricky, and it's my first time here and I didn't really figure them out.   Hit a few bad shots on the back nine and got max punished for them.   
But I think I've played well, but my short game has not been good enough this week.  
   
 Q.   How is the neck?  
THORBJORN OLESEN:   The neck is better, but I'm still on a lot of pills and getting a lot of treatment, so it's not perfect, but I can play golf now.   
   
 Q.   Disappointed at the way you were hurt right before this and‑‑  
THORBJORN OLESEN:   Yeah, very.   I'm very disappointed.   I've played really well.   Obviously at Bay Hill I felt like my game was going the right way, and Houston in the practice round I was playing really well.   So it was a couple steps in the wrong way unfortunately.   That's probably why my short game was not good enough this week.   
   
 Q.   What's your schedule after this?   
THORBJORN OLESEN:   A week off and then I'm going to play New Orleans, Zurich.   
   
 Q.   And then back to Europe?  
THORBJORN OLESEN:   Back to Europe for Wentworth.   
   
 Q.   Did the course play a lot different for you being the first group out today?   Obviously you had a nice 70.   
THORBJORN OLESEN:   I think the pin placements were trickier today, but we got a lot of rain, and that made the course easier, unfortunately, and it was starting to firm up out there.   But hopefully it stays really windy.   
   
 Q.   The scores are a little higher today, mostly just because of the wind?  
THORBJORN OLESEN:   The wind and the pin placements are definitely trickier than yesterday.   
   
 Q.   What's your overall assessment of this golf course?  
THORBJORN OLESEN:   It is extremely hilly.   It's difficult to see on TV, but yeah, it is.   But it's been really special for me to be here, but unfortunately I didn't play good enough.
