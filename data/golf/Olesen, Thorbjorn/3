Q. How do you feel about the round?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I thought I played better yesterday to be honest.  It's quite tough, the first nine holes I guess, a bit breezy and a bit cooler.  I just wasn't hitting the ball as good as yesterday, but managed to get a few putts in, which is nice, and so it was a bit of a mix today.
