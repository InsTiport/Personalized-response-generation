 Q.   Another good day?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, still shot 4‑under, it's a good score, but disappointed,6 and 17, and a few putts‑‑ well, I hit two good shots and it's over the green and I had a bad lie and made double.   
   
 Q.   That's really annoying.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It is very annoying, yeah.   
   
 Q.   But you bounced back with a bogey at the last.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I could easily have been 6‑ or 7‑under today.   
   
 Q.   I think that putt was quite important for your team, for your amateur partners?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I saw that now, we just got to 21 and we are probably going to make it, so I'm very happy for Rob.   
   
 Q.   Eagle at the third?   What happened there?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Hit a good drive and a brilliant 3‑wood up to five feet.   Holed the putt.   So, yeah, it was three great shots.   
   
 Q.   That's a great start, and you must have had it in your mind that you had to stay in touch with Branden Grace?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, yeah, I knew when I was going off yesterday‑‑ we had a good start, made eagle and missed a few short putts.   It was still a good day but could have been a lot better.  
   
 Q.   Going to St. Andrews tomorrow where you had a 63 on the first day, so that must give you confidence for tomorrow?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Definitely, I find the greens at St. Andrews easy to read.   I had a tough time today reading the greens.   I'm looking forward to getting to St. Andrews tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Would you say you're more comfortable at the back chasing someone or objecting at the front?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, he's at 20, he's a great player but I'm going to do my best.
