Q. How much difference did a day make to shoot the round of the week so far?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I played really well.  I had a couple of good breaks, also.  I hit the tee shot right on 8 in the desert, made birdie.  Did the same on 16.  Got lucky with the drive and made birdie.  That's a couple of good breaks.  But besides that, I played really, really well.  And I putted a lot better than yesterday.  Yesterday I felt like I was playing some good golf.  Just missed a couple of really short putts.
Q. You've done this in the trickier conditions; you've done this in the wind.  Did it help you were playing so well in Qatar last week?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I think so.  Always like when there's a little breeze.  I think sometimes it helps me actually.  There was a few holes it was tricky into the wind, but there's some holes that are downwind, also, makes it easier.  Yeah, I was just playing really good golf.
I love this tournament, and I really want to do well in this tournament, so I was very focused on Thursday and I felt like I played some good golf.  Couple of bad putts, but yeah, I feel like I'm playing good and excited for this weekend.
Q. I take it that excitement grows and grows when you're going from maybe looking over your shoulder to being right up there and just one off the lead.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, definitely, but looks like shot off the lead and it will be a good weekend.  You need to hit good golf shots out there, and hopefully I can keep doing that.
