 Q.   The start, the finish, the putt at the last, nice way to finish?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   That's a nice one, a long putt, yeah.   It was nice to see it go in.   I had a few lip‑outs out there, so it was nice to finish with holing a good putt.   
   
 Q.   Watching you on TV, the commentators said every time they saw you, you were the in middle of the fairway.   Was your driving particularly good today?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it's been good the last two days, definitely.   I hit a lot of solid drives and good iron, also.   I actually thought I left a few out there today.   Could have been a few more.   3‑under is still a good score at Carnoustie.  
   
 Q.   And Kingsbarns tomorrow, good scoring course there hopefully if you keep playing well?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It all depends on the weather I would say but if it stays like this, there is a lot of birdie chances.  
   
 Q.   And you're on the same score as your good friend Joel, that's a nice feeling?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I was standing on the last three holes, I thought, I need to make a birdie just to tie him.   It was quite funny.   
   
 Q.   All season you've kind of been inspiring each other, would you say?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, we have a really good friendship, and I think that's good in the game also.   
   
 Q.   So if you don't win this week, you want to see him win this week, and vice versa?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, definitely.
