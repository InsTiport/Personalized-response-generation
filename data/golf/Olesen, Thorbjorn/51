Q.   What are your thoughts on how well you played this week and a good finish in the end? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Well, any time you finish in the Top‑10, it's been a good week.   Unfortunately on the back nine, I couldn't really hit it close and I couldn't hole the putts.   So a little bit unfortunate, the bogey on 17, had a good chance on 18 also.   But yeah, it's been a good week, Top‑10.

Q.   So many positive thoughts when you got off to three birdies in the first few holes‑‑
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Two birdies.   I was 2‑under, playing nicely.   And a bad bogey and then a couple of good birdies.   But yeah, I played steady but nothing special. 

Q.   And Top‑10 in this kind of field is very good for Race to Dubai points which were really boosted with Perth and then World Rankings, as well?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, Top‑10 in a championship like this is a great result.   I'm happy with that.   Yeah, it's been a good week and a great golf course, and I've enjoyed playing here.   It's a tough golf course.   So it was a good setup for me.
