Q. Nearly birdied 18, turned away at the last minute.  Would have been a nice way to finish.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Would have been a great way.
I was keeping pace and felt like I was hitting some good shots and giving myself some good chances.  Two great putts on 16 and 17.
Q. We spoke yesterday about leads evaporating on this golf course and that's what's happened today and now all of a sudden you're back in the mix, defending champion going into the final day?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I feel good about the course, a lot of good memories.  Yeah, by the looks of it now, I've got a small chance, if I go out and shoot a really low number, we'll see what happens.
