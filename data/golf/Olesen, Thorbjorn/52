  THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Thought it was pretty good today.   Had a bad mistake on 8 and cost me a double‑bogey, and the 3‑putt on 17 was unfortunate.   But the rest of it was really good.   Played solid and 3‑under is a really good score on this course.   So, I mean, yeah, quite pleased with the round.  
   
 Q.   Looks like the course has played difficult all week but presumably in the cold like this and after the rain, even trickier?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it was cold today and it got a little bit darker on last three or four holes, also, and a small breeze made it tricky.   But the conditions are perfect.   If you can hit it on the greens, you have a good chance to hole a few putts out there.  
Yeah, it's a great course to play.  
   
 Q.   Presumably you were conscious, making those birdies on the start at least, just how close you were getting?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, got off to a good start.   I was 2‑under until I got to 8 and made that double‑bogey, but I fought my way back and got it back to 7‑under.   So, yeah, quite happy.  
   
 Q.   I know we touched on this in Perth two weeks ago, but your form has been coming really nice over a few months now.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, like I said to you in Perth there, since the PGA this year, I feel like I've played some really good golf.   Yeah, it's paying off now and I'm starting to roll the putts in, also, and my short game is getting a lot better.   
So yeah, it's nice to be up there in contention and hopefully go out there tomorrow and enjoy myself and shoot a good score.   
   
 Q.   It's enjoyable, isn't it, when you come off the back of Perth International, you were saying there's so much more to play for and you're not feeling the fatigue yet?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No, I feel good.   I feel good in my body.   I've done a lot of physical training, and, yeah, I feel ready.   So I'm excited to get out there tomorrow and see what it brings.   
   
 Q.   What will it take?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I think it's a long way for me but you never know on this golf course, if you start missing a few drives, you can easily make a few bogeys and worse.   So I'm going to go out there and enjoy myself and try to be aggressive.
