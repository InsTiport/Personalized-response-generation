  SCOTT CROCKETT:   ThorbjÃ¸rn, thanks for coming in and joining us.   Well played this morning.   Decent effort, I know you were pleased with a lot of elements of that.   Just give us the bits you were most pleased about.   I think the driving was one of them, wasn't it? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I hit a lot of drives, and that's been my problem the last few weeks.   So it's nice to see the practice has been paying off.   Hit a lot of fairways and I'm still hitting the irons really good.   I gave myself a lot of chances for birdie.   So, yeah, I was very pleased. 
SCOTT CROCKETT:   It's been a good year, obviously the win in Sicily and a good recent spell; you had a chance in Austria and as we know and doing well in the majors.   It's been a decent spell for you.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It has.   It was a long stretch there and I played well mostly and then got that win.   It's been a lot of good weeks and I think I learned a lot from The Open and the PGA, also.   It's nice to make the championship. 
It's been a good stretch and I've definitely learned a lot. 
SCOTT CROCKETT:   A long way to go, but do you fancy another Dane's name in the trophy to follow up Mr. BjÃ¶rn? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it would be nice to follow him.   He's a big idol for me, so it would be really big for me to follow his footsteps. 

Q.   What is the best advice you've ever had from Thomas?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I think it must be in Italy last year where he gave me a little putting lesson and I shot 10‑under the next day.   So it's probably the best advice. 

Q.   What did he tell you?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I was a little bit close with my shoulders, and he opened me up and it turned out to be the right thing. 
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Did you pay him any money? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I'll pay him dinner.

Q.   What did you take out of The Open?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I got to see that my game is definitely good enough to be in a Major Championship and be up there in contention.   So obviously playing with Tiger and playing in one of the last groups showed that I can handle the pressure, also, and play well under big pressure.   So, yeah, I was very pleased. 

Q.   Anything surprise you playing with Tiger?   Had you ever seen anything quite like that before? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   A lot of camera guys and a few bodyguards, and just a massive crowd.   So, yeah, it was really special, and it was a great experience for me. 

Q.   As a young player coming through, having made yourself a winner, who do you measure yourself against?   There's a whole generation of players out there who presumably measure themselves against Tiger Woods; have we moved on a generation?   Do you measure yourself against Rory or something like that?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No, Rory is a fantastic player in general.   Yeah, you do sometimes, but Tiger Woods is my biggest idol, definitely.   But Rory being world No. 1, and Martin Kaymer also, it's nice to see so many young guys win major championships and get to world No. 1, also.   It's given me some confidence that I can get up there, also. 

Q.   Goals for the rest of the year‑‑
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It would be really nice to get my second win.   And my goal from the start of the year was to get in the Top‑20 in The Race to Dubai, and that's still my goal.   Nice to move up in the World Ranking and it would be nice to move up a little bit more so I can get into the big events. 

Q.   What did you do‑‑
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No, not really.   I do a lot of fitness and I really enjoy that.   I play a little bit of football but not much. 

Q.   In your profile‑‑ (Inaudible.)
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it was in a lot of magazines, so I think it has, but I love the golf so much, I don't really know. 

Q.   If you were asked how Danes differ from, say, Spaniards, what would you say about Danes? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   That's a tough one.   I don't know.   I think there's a lot of good Danish guys coming up now on Tour.   But the difference‑‑ I don't really know. 

Q.   Spanish are quite fiery and feisty; you are sort of a quieter people from Denmark. 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, we probably are.   We are very focused I think, and we want to reach our goals‑‑ maybe, yeah, we are a little bit more quiet on the course but off the course I think we are having a good time, also. 
SCOTT CROCKETT:   But you had a good time on the course today.   Well done.
