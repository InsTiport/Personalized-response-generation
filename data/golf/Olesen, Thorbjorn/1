Q. Great round, bogey-free.  Tell me about it.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I mean, especially my putting was really good today.  Got in trouble there a couple of times and holed two really, really good par saves.  That was key.  And then coming in, hit a few good shots and holed the putts.  Yeah, especially my putting was great today.
Q. Seem to really like these Rolex Series Events.  You've won one before.  How are you enjoying your time in Lahinch?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I love it.  I've always loved coming to Ireland.  I played well here a few times, also.  But yeah, I think links golf, just I embrace it and love it, and you know, that helps.  Sometimes it can be pretty tricky.
Yeah, it's always been a type of golf that I really, really enjoy.
Q. What part of your game?
Q. We talk about links golf being quite testing.  What part of your game was tested the most today?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: There's a couple of tee shots with left-to-right wind and that's tricky to hold it up in the fairway.  But all in all, I mean, the wind wasn't really picking up like yesterday afternoon.  In the Pro-Am, it was really windy and a bit tough.  Yeah, it was a bit easier this morning.
Q. After today's experience, how does your game plan change going into tomorrow?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I mean, we'll probably get some wind in the afternoon and it will play a lot tougher.  So yeah, you need to be patient, and for me, it's just keeping focused on the right place in my swing and not so much think about the outcome, but concentrate on my swing more.
