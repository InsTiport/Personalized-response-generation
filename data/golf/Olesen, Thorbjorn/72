Q.   You beat Jamie Donaldson 3 and 2.   Tell us a little bit about that match. 
THORBJORN OLESEN:   Well, it was difficult yesterday the first seven holes we played, but I holed out really well yesterday, and that was important.   And I played solid today, not specific but really solid.   Holed a few putts, and that's what you need to do in this game.

Q.   First time at this championship.   When you saw the course in practice, did you think you liked it?
THORBJORN OLESEN:   I do like it because it's tough, and par is a good score here.   You can win holes with par.   I do like it, and you need to be straight and hit solid shots, so I think it suits me pretty well.

Q.   How much experience do you have in match play and how do you approach it?
THORBJORN OLESEN:   Well, it's a long time since I've played match play, actually, but I do love it.   I think it's a great format.   I think it's fun to watch, also. 

Q.   When was the last time you played match play? 
THORBJORN OLESEN:   Like really match play, probably amateur days when I was 17 or something. 

Q.   How long ago was that then?
THORBJORN OLESEN:   Five, six years, yeah.   I played a little bit when I was professional, but that was club match play and not serious.

Q.   Did you have any success as an amateur?
THORBJORN OLESEN:   No, I played the British Boys two times, and I think I lost in the first round the first year and came to the second or third round.   So not really, but I always enjoyed it.   I think it suits my game all right.

Q.   I suppose it's a different animal when you're playing against these guys. 
THORBJORN OLESEN:   Yeah, it is, and you know, you have to beat them every hole, match him.   You have to think different, and I kind of like it.
