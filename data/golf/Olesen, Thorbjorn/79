 Q.   How do you reflect on 4‑under to start the tournament?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I played really lovely today.   Unfortunately I finished with a bogey but it was a really steady round and I never got in trouble out there, so it was good.   
   
 Q.   Despite the fact it's a difficult course‑‑  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I was very rusty last week but did a lot of practise the last two weeks.   My game has improved and I hit a lot of 5‑woods today, which is very important.   It was nice.   
   
 Q.   After last week, has that helped, having four competitive rounds under your belt?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, definitely.   I had a long break in December, I had three or four weeks off.   So need to get back into it.   But two good weeks with a lot of practise, feels pretty good now.   
   
 Q.   What did you do, recharge the batteries?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I needed it.   I didn't have a break for a long time, so it was nice to be able to take a few weeks off.  
   
 Q.   How do you look at 2013, bearing in mind what happened last year?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, a lot of things that I can improve from last year, but I had a great season, and I want to win more tournaments, that's it.
