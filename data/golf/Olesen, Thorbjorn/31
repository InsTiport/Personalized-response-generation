Q. What do you think of 6-under to start?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Well, I felt like the last few weeks, it's been really good.  I felt like I played really, really nicely in Portugal and couldn't really get it going but felt like I was playing really well.
Yesterday in the Pro-Am I was playing really, really well also, so I felt like something good was going to come soon?
Q. Is this a product of good, hard work, or something just clicked?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, hard work, that's always what it is in golf, really.
Q. Are you enjoying this track in the sunshine?  What's not to like?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, actually I played here before on The Challenge Tour.  I think it's probably six or seven years ago.  I didn't know that before I played yesterday in the Pro-Am.  I enjoy it.  I always love coming to Turkey.  It's great golf courses can, great hotel, the service is fantastic.  It's always very enjoyable to be here.
Q. So when you're playing that Pro-Am, you recognised a few things and presumably things have changed or developed a bit?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, there was a few changes.  There was a new hole I think.  I got a lot of flashbacks when I was out there.  Obviously they changed 9 and 10, so we play it as 10 and 11 now that they put in an extra par 3.  But yeah, a lot of flashbacks from when I played here.
Q. You were always coming back; you always had this Final Series event on the calendar?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, definitely.  When you are in these tournaments, you know you've had a pretty good year and you played good.  The best guys on The European Tour is playing here, so it's great to be here in The Final Series.
