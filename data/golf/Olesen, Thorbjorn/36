Q. What do you make of that at the start then?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: The key to this round, I was struggling a little bit on the first nine but had some great up-and-downs and saved par 3 times.  I just got it going there on the back nine and hit some beautiful shots, and yeah, the key was to save the pars on the front nine.  Yeah, back nine was great.
Q. You look like you just threw a switch and suddenly birdie after birdie after birdie and you're flying up there?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, my patience was good.  I was fighting for par a few times and then all of the sudden, I started hitting great golf shots.  It makes it a lot easier out there.  It was tricky today.  It was very windy, very hot, and you know, the course started to firm up.  There's some deep, deep rough out there.  It's very tricky out there today, so I'm pleased with 5-under.
Q. How are the greens, because after the rain, they were bound to be soft and cutting up a bit in the afternoon?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah -- there were definitely a lot of spike marks the whole way around.  It's got a lot of rain unfortunately, but the fairways and everything else is great.  You just have to get over it and just hit good putts and hope they go in.
Q. In general terms, it sounds like you're feeling pretty good about your game and the way things are going?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Been working hard the last few weeks, and it was a bit of a struggle to start with and then sort of find my game.  Yeah, I feel pretty good.
