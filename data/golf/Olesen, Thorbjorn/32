THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Plus one today was not what I would have wanted but I have now got Carnousite out of the way and I am not out of things at one over.
I was in bed for most of the day yesterday and felt a bit sick so in that respect Iâm pretty happy to have got round today. It was quite tricky out there, Carnoustie is always difficult and today was quite breezy as well.
