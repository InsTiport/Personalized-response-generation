 Q.   What's verdict on the week?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, it's been a great week to be honest but I didn't play good today.   It was probably the worst I've played these three weeks, so it was not easy out there.   Just try to keep on fighting, but it didn't go my way.   I holed a great putt on 3 and that was about it.   
Yeah, I played great for three days, and unfortunately I didn't play good enough today.  
   
 Q.   Sounds like it must be hugely frustrating particularly when you look at that leaderboard and know that you're not that far adrift.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   That's what I mean, I'm only three shots from the lead, and yeah, that's very disappointing for me.   But I didn't play good enough and I didn't strike it well enough with my irons, so that's what happens.  
   
 Q.   You're the kind of player that takes that on the chin and uses it to make you stronger?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I didn't play my best and I'm still in the top 5 and have a chance to win.   I know if I play my best, I'll definitely be up there and could have been this week.   It's been a great week for me and I enjoy playing here.   
   
 Q.   What's next?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It's going to be in America in two weeks' time.   
   
 Q.   So a little break until then, recharge the batteries?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Exactly, going home and a week break so that's going to be nice.
