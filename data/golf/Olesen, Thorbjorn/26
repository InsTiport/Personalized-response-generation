 Q.  Straight to the fourth hole.  What happened there?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Obviously I hit the second shot on the bank and it rolled back in the hazard and I had to drop it down.  It was a very steep slope and almost impossible to find a spot.  I tried like ten times and then in the end, me and Ernie thought we found a spot.  We could still see it moving around.  I took five steps up to the green, and it rolled back in the hazard.  And obviously we called a rules official over, and obviously he didn't know the rules, and then it ended up giving me a one-stroke penalty.  I still don't agree with it but it is what it is.   
 Q.  How do you deal with a situation like that?  Obviously you've got to keep calm, playing golf, but how do you deal with it?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It's especially annoying it comes after a couple of holes because the rules official didn't get it right, so that makes it a little bit worse.  But I mean, I holed two great putts after, so I guess that was pretty good.   
 Q.  Still big time in it, aren't you.  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah.  I hope I can have a good weekend and, yeah, find some of the game I had on Thursday and, yeah, see if we can hole some putts and have a lovely weekend.   
 Q.  How are conditions out there today?  It's a bit windier, wasn't it?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, it was tricky.  It was definitely not easy.  I thought the scores was pretty good compared to how difficult it actually was.  It's very gusty around here, and we're always in the trees and it's difficult to get the wind right all the time.  I thought it was very tricky and to be honest the pin positions, especially on the back nine, our front nine, was very tough.
