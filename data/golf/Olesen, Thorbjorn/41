Q. Thoughts on the start in windy conditions?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It's good.  Got off to a slow start, really, but a nice chip-in on 16 got me going.  Then I had three birdies on the run and kept on going.  It was pretty breezy out there, so it's difficult.  But I managed to keep the ball in play all the time, and yeah, played pretty solid.
Q. I suppose it wasn't quite as windy as we thought it would be but still hugely challenging.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, it is.  It's a lot warmer than what was expected, also.  It was actually a nice day out there but still difficult, and you still have to be really concentrated.
Q. Do you relish that kind of challenge?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I like it.  Us Danish people, we grow up with a lot of wind and cold.  Yeah, I like it.  I think it's a great layout, this golf course.  It suits to be breezy out here.  Yeah, it was a good challenge.
Q. You are the Dunhill Links champion and this is linksy, so might meet your eye.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It not really a linksy golf course, but breezy.  But you need to play a few shots out there, a few low ones in this wind.  Every hole has a little bit of a side wind, so you need to control the ball very well.
Q. Do you feel that you wintered well and that your game is in good shape?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I've worked hard.  I changed a lot of things over winter, and it seems to be more confident with it now.  But it's still difficult and I still have to work hard on it.  But yeah, I'm in a good process right now.
