THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, it was a lot calmer today.  We were just walking around waiting for the storm actually but lucky enough for us, we got to play all 18 holes but it doesn't look too well now.   
But I played better today.  A few bad drives on the last nine holes, the front nine, but besides that, I played nicely.  It's a great way to finish with two birdies and get me right up there in contention.
