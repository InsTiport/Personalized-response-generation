Q.   Talk about the difference today to previous days. 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I played well the first two days also, but today I saw the lines on the green and my pace was brilliant.   And so I holed a few really, really good putts, and I hit a lot more greens today, as well. 
But it was perfect for me; it was a little bit windy today so I knew that it was going to be a little bit tougher so I just had a lot of patience and hit a lot of good shots.

Q.   I guess the experience of the first two days tells you there are opportunities coming home?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, there is some.   The greens are fast and firm.   They are probably some of the fastest greens we play on, so if you hit good putts, it's going to roll in, and I did that today.   So hopefully I can keep on doing it tomorrow.

Q.   Similar scenario to last week?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I mean, we'll see the end of the day how many I'm behind, but I'm definitely up there in contention for tomorrow, so hopefully down the stretch tomorrow, I'll have a chance. 

Q.   Presumably that was the aim today, really, just to get low enough to give yourself that opportunity?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Exactly and it was a bit windy so it's going to be tougher today.   Hopefully the leaders won't run away and I will still have a chance tomorrow. 

Q.   Enjoying it?   Nice place to come? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I am.   I'm playing great and the Middle East is a great place for me.   I really feel good here and I play some great golf.
