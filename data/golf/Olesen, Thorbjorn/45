THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Unbelievable, especially the way it came along, under a lot of pressure there and obviously I had a few dropped shots early on, which just made it even tougher.  I just kept on fighting, kept being patient out there.  Trying to hit greens, trying to give myself birdie chances.  And then it was a big relief when I saw that putt roll in on 15.  Gave me a bit of room on the last three holes, 16 and 17 are definitely not easy.  So I knew I had to hit some proper golf shots.
Q. And that was a magnificent putt, wasn't it, to see that drop from that distance?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, it was very long, a very long putt but pretty straight, just a perfect speed.  It's not really a putt you expect to hole, but sometimes you just have it, and it was my week, if you can say so.
Q. Given the year you've had, I appreciate there's an awful lot of hard work, but is this a little bit out of the blue, come sooner than you expected?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I feel like I've been playing some good rounds.  I just haven't been able to play all four good rounds, or even two good rounds together.  So it's nice to have been able this week to put three really, really good rounds, and a solid round today, also.  It was not easy conditions.  So yeah, it was just great to see.
Q. How much was saving your card playing on your mind?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: After yesterday, I just tried to go out and see if I could win the tournament with a three-shot lead.  That was all I was thinking about.  About you obviously last night, it was still in the back of my head but tried to throw it out of my head and keep focusing on winning.
