  THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it was good.   Played a lot more solid today.   Yesterday I got off to a bad start.   I was plus four after nine holes with a couple of double‑bogeys but played nicely on the back nine yesterday and just kept that momentum today.   Gave myself a lot of chances.   Unfortunate on 8,9 finish, but played solid, a lot of fairways today, which is key here.

Q.   A tremendous bounceback; I know we didn't see you at your best last week.   Is that the hangover from a victory in a sense? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I guess it's always difficult to come the week after you won but I actually felt like I played all right last week.   The putting was not great but this week, my putting has been very good.   Rolling it nicely.   I feel like I've got the speed on the greens.   So looking forward to the weekend here.

Q.   Does this course suit you? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I think so.   My driving is getting a lot better.   I missed the one on 9 here but I hit a lot of fairways today. 
Yeah, I like the golf course.   It's a great setup, great par 3s out there and there's some good risk/reward holes on the par5 holes.   It's a great place to play.

Q.   And you got on pretty well last visit, didn't you, as well, to Sheshan? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I did.   I think I had a Top‑10.   Yeah, I like China.   It's a great golf course and the conditions are perfect.   Looking forward to getting to the weekend.

Q.   And parties planned for when you eventually get home?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it will be awhile before I get home but yeah, there might be.   We'll see.   I'll have a little think about it and hopefully there will be some friends when I get home.
