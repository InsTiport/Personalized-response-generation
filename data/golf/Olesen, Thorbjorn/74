 Q.   You followed yesterday's 67 with one less today; how did your play compare?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I played more solidly definitely.   I rolled the putts really nicely the first two days, and that's why I'm 11‑under.   It was more solid today and I striked the irons a lot better today.   I was still struggling a little bit from the tee and I got a few good breaks out there, especially on 8.   Settled for par there.   
   
 Q.   The breeze got up at times; do you enjoy the challenge of having to shape your ball and control trajectory?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it's nice, I like to keep the ball low.   It's good for me when it's windy.   It was actually windy the whole day from the morning.   It was pretty tough out there.  
   
 Q.   I was asking some of the top players in the world who they expect to be the next big star, and they all said you.   How do you feel about that?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I feel great (smiling).   That's a great complement.   I'm very pleased that they say such nice things about me.   
   
 Q.   Does it add any sense of pressure that other people have got such great expectations for you?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, maybe a little bit, but I have big pressure on myself, also.   I believe in myself and I want to achieve my own goals, and that's the biggest pressure.   
   
 Q.   What were the keys to that great performance today?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I think the keys to yesterday and today was the putting.   I rolled the putter really nicely out there and holed some really good putts.   I started with four birdies today and that made it a little bit easier.   It's definitely the putting and the irons were really nice today, also, I striked them really solid.  
   
 Q.   You've hit the ground running this season.   What are the expectations?   Are you hungry for a win?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I'm hungry for more wins, yeah.   I want to win twice this season.   That's my main goal.   So the quicker I can get the first one, the better.   
   
 Q.   With regard to the playing conditions out there today, it was obviously very windy this morning, but you clearly relished that challenge?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Like I said I hit the irons really solid and it was definitely windy this morning, also.   It was not easy.   But I holed some nice putts.   
   
 Q.   Yesterday, you didn't seem entirely happy despite being 5‑under and you're now 11‑under, haven't dropped a shot.   What are the thoughts now?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I played a lot better today.   I hit the driver after yesterday's round and I found something with the irons, so that was nice.   I still need to find something with the driver.   I hit a few bad ones today but I managed to keep it in play and hole a few nice putts.   
   
 Q.   We've seen you have a lovely run of form plenty of times in the past but is this one of the best going on from Abu Dhabi and keeping the form alive?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I've played really nice, and it's been three great tournaments for me.   Hopefully I can finish it off this one.   
   
 Q.   I guess most players say they are still learning.   Are you in that bracket?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I think I'm 23, so definitely still learning, and I have a lot to learn.   It's a really good progress I'm in now so hopefully I can keep going that way.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on being in a prominent position on the leaderboard?   Are you getting more and more comfortable with it?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Definitely I am, yeah.   More confidence and more belief in myself that I can do it.   So hopefully I can keep rolling the putts over the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Turning into a fantastic start to the season, isn't it?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it's nice, especially after the first two rounds in every tournament I've been up there.   Hopefully this week I can play a little bit better over the weekend and finish it off.   
   
 Q.   What's been the key, because you've gone through a club change, as well, haven't you, in the close season and you really have settled so easily.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, I didn't play good the first two in South Africa, but I changed a few things after that week and I've just striked the ball really nicely, with the irons especially, and my putting has been good all four weeks, so that's definitely one of the keys to why I'm up there.  
   
 Q.   And that was very much the key today, as well, wasn't it?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I holed some great putts.   I started on 10 and holed a long putt there and just kept on going.   It was nice to see the ball rolling in.  
   
 Q.   Are you playing the best golf of your life right now?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No, I don't think so.   I think I can improve a lot of things, and especially my driving has not been the best the first two days.   So hopefully I can find something on the range today and hit it a little bit better tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   But do you sense that there are big things around the corner for you, given the way you've started this year?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I think the more times I'm up there, I have a better chance to win, so my chances should be better this week after the first two.   So no, I'm looking forward to the weekend, and I enjoy being up there.   
   
 Q.   You managed to keep an incredibly clean card these last three weeks, I think it's like ten bogeys and a double, if I looked it up right?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, that's probably right.   The last couple of days in Qatar was not very good but other than that, it's been really good, yeah.   One of the keys is definitely my iron play has been so good and I've hit a lot of greens and that makes it easy not to make bogeys, and then the putting.  
   
 Q.   When you turned pro so young, what were your options at that point?   Had you gotten any interest from colleges or anything like that or were just going to go pro all the way?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I just had a long chat with my coach and my family, and we thought if I was going to improve my game, then it was the best way to do it to turn pro.   
   
 Q.   Tell us something about your start today, the first four holes?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I hit a good drive and then hooked my second shot on the 10th.   I blocked it right, actually, and hit a bad clip and holed a really long putt.   That's really a good way to start the round.   It was off the green, so probably 25 feet maybe.   
And from there, I played really good.   I hit a good shot on the next and a great shot on the par 4 and then I hit it on 2 on the par5 and made an easy birdie there.   I played really good from there on.   
   
 Q.   What did you hit on 12 for your second shot and how far was it?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   On the par 4, I think I had 140 meters, 9‑iron.   
   
 Q.   Were you a month ago sweating your World Ranking or do you know it was going to be 50?   You were 51, second to last and obviously that was a magic number.   Did you have a pretty good idea that you were going to be there?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No, I thought I would slip out of the Top‑50 definitely.   After The Race to Dubai, there was three or four events I think and I chose not to play and take some time off.   No, I thought I would definitely slip out of it.   But lucky enough, I've stayed in there and gotten into the Masters.
