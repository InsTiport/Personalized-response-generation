Q.   Thoughts on the week? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I played some solid golf all week, and didn't have that many bogeys.   I probably should have made a few more birdies, but it was a really solid week.   I had a chance coming down 18.   I tried to play aggressive the last four holes, and 15 I went for the pin, also, and on 17, I went for the pin.

Q.   Given that you said you have not been up there for a while, it's nice to know that you kept it going right to the wire?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I did.   I kept myself very focused and concentrated on my own game, and just played nicely.   Didn't play as good as the first three days, but still hitting solid and it was two good shots down on 18 and a little tricky putt.   But I felt like I was confident out there. 

Q.   It bodes well for weeks to come. 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I'm playing next week in Dubai, and hopefully I can move up a couple of spots more and be there on Sunday, as well.
