THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Always love coming back here to BMW.  Obviously played pretty well last year.  Had a bad Saturday but then came strongly back on Sunday and was in contention.  So yeah, there's a lot of good memories.  Been in Munich quite a few times now and always love coming back here.   
 Q.  And BMW always put on a good show and look after the players?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, they do.  Just last night, a great event in the park and got to hit a few bunker shots in front of a lot of people.  No, they always put on a great show, and a great event, and I think this year with the changes of the golf course, it's really, really good.   
So yeah, looking forward to it.   
 Q.  That second-place finish last year put you to No. 6 in The Race to Dubai, and of course towards The Ryder Cup.  How big was that in your pursuit of making Ryder Cup debut appearance at Le Golf National?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It was massive.  Obviously I just got on the team, so every point counted for me.  So to go out on Sunday, go out early and just be aggressive and shoot such a good score and move up the leaderboard was huge.  Definitely gave me a lot of confidence after that week.   
 Q.  And you come from the U.S. Open; BMW flew you over.  How is your form coming into this week?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Been struggling a bit to be honest.  So it's definitely time to change it around.  I couldn't find a better place to do it than here in Munich.  Hopefully I can turn the season around this week and play well from then.
