  Q. Disappointing finish on the 18th for sure still a fantastic tournament from your side. Tell us a bit how was it.   
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Well, it was great to be out there, the French crowd was amazing. I know they were cheering for Thomas, but still, it was nice, he's a really nice guy, and so we had a lot of fun out there. And I played good and coming down the stretch, I was hitting -- I missed the putt on 18. Thought I hit a good putt but didn't go in.   
  
  Q. Still after the second spot in The Italian Open, what do you take from this tournament, for tournaments to come?  
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: This is the first one I've played for such a big crowd so it was a really good experience for me and hopefully next time I can go out and do a little bit better and win.
