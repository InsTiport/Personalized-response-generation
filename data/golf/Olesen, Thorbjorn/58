  THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, actually, I felt like I played better yesterday.   Hit a lot more fairways, a lot more greens yesterday.   But started out holing a great putt on the first and second, and just found something in the stroke. 
So I felt great on the greens and holed a lot of great putts, especially inside ten feet.   A lot of like four‑ or five‑footers for par.   And that's what's important. 
And the greens were really, really quick today and difficult.   So I just felt comfortable on the greens.   And then I hit a few shots really close also here, 9 and 18, and took advantage of some of the par 5s. 
So it was a great round of golf.   And especially on the greens, it was nice to get that going because that's been my big issue the whole year. 
So it was nice all of a sudden to just see them roll in.

Q.   Anything different going on in your putting?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I changed actually before I went out.   I changed last night after the round and started to put some more forward pressure on the putter, and that really worked out today.   So it was nice.

Q.   And then you got two par 5s today.   What's the importance of birdieing those par 5s?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   The key is to hit the fairway.   Actually missed a short one here on the first par 5 on the front nine, but to get the fairways there because the rough is really high.   But then if you get to the fairway, you have a good chance to hit the green in two or get close. 
So that's the key point on these par 5 holes on the back nine.   If you hit the fairway, you can really take advantage of them.

Q.   And just talk a little bit about you got a good round in the morning, you know the golf course is only going to get harder, your position going into the weekend?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, definitely felt like the golf course was harder today actually than yesterday.   A little bit firmer and faster greens. 
But they're rolling really nice and just really pure, the greens.   So hopefully the wind picks up a little bit and it gets firmer and the guys will struggle out there.

Q.   And just how has your year been this year out on the European Tour?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I've played all right on the European Tour.   I've struggled over here in America.   Like I said, putting has a been key issue to my game.   Too many three‑putts and missed putts inside of ten feet. 
And that was really good for me to see them roll in today and just feel I got that confidence on the green. 
But, yeah, I started out well on the European Tour, and got over here and been struggling a little bit.   But been working hard every week, and I know it's going to come back.   And I feel a lot more comfortable with the ball, with the long irons and the driving.   So I'm hitting more fairways. 
It started last week, actually, at Wentworth in Europe where I started hitting a lot more fairways.   And that's been quite a big issue for me also, so ‑‑ and this week, I mean, I know the fairways are a little bit wider, but still there's a lot of pressure on some of the tee shots. 
So it's nice to see I started hitting the driver and 3‑wood well.

Q.   Did you change your driver or anything, or was it just‑‑
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No.   I've changed a little bit in my setup last week, actually, in my long irons and driver and 3‑wood.   So that's just helped me. 
I just feel better over the ball.   The swing is not that big change, but I feel comfortable over the ball and I feel like I can hit it now and don't really think about it too much.

Q.   And then finally anything you're going to do this afternoon?   Are you going to go practice or anything?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Practice, and then I'm going to go to the gym and have a good workout.

Q.   (Question not recorded).
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I really love this golf course.   I think it's one of the best I ever played.   I got here late Monday night and played 18 holes Tuesday morning and just loved it.   I've seen it on TV many times, and to get out there was a pleasure to see the golf course for the first time. 
And the condition of the course is absolutely perfect.   The greens were faster today and a little bit firmer.   I think that's what Mr.Nicklaus wants. 
So I think it's going to be tricky over the weekend, if it keeps getting firmer.

Q.   Have you had a chance to shake his hand and introduce yourself?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I did.   I had a clinic with him on Wednesday.   So that was a big honor for me to meet him in the locker room.   It's really something that's really big for me.

Q.   It really is, there's no question.   I don't care who you are or where you're from.   Coming over here and playing in the U.S., are you getting more comfortable with the atmosphere over here?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I've been struggling over here in America.   I got off to a pretty good start in Europe and then my game just fell apart a little bit.   Especially struggling on the greens. 
And today just seemed like I could hole everything.   And that was really nice to see them rolling in and get that confidence on the greens. 
That's been a big issue, but I feel like I'm getting there now.
