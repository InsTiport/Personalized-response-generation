 Q.   All the positives, what are your thoughts on 67 around there?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Played well.   Like I said before, I know this golf course very well.   I've played it a lot of times.   It feels like a second home golf course for me really.   I played lovely, hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.   Hit a few really close, and the putter was working nicely.   It was a really solid day.  
   
 Q.   A lovely purple patch out with a run of birdies.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, especially 8 and 9 is two tough holes.   To birdie those two was extremely important for the round, and I hit it really close.   It can be a tough stretch there so it was nice to get over that easily and with some nice birdies.  
   
 Q.   Have to ask about the blip.   Does it really damage your day too much or are you still really positive?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, when you're 7‑under going to 16, and you know you have 18 which is a possible birdie chance, also.   Of course it's a little bit disappointing, but I took a chance and it didn't work out very well.   But I felt like it was going so well and I felt like I could pull it off.   But yeah, that's what happens in golf.  
   
 Q.   Did you fancy your chances with your knowledge of the course and the way you played in Australia and China?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, definitely, I played this golf course a lot of times and I know the place and where it hit it from the tee.   I feel comfortable going out and playing here, but it's always nice to play well.   You can easily know the place very well and not play great.
