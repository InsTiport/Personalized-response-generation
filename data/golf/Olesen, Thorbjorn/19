Q. Final round 66, three birdies in a row coming home.  Put a little bit of pressure on but just coming up a little bit short in the end?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I actually felt like I had a chance today, definitely.  During that middle part of the round, I played very nicely.  Gave myself so many chances.
Yeah, they didn't drop in at the right time.  And then on the back nine, the last few holes, I started hitting a couple of poor shots because I got annoyed by myself.  I felt like I had a chance, so still a good week.
Q. Are you a leaderboard watcher when you were going around?  Were you aware what's going on elsewhere?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, always, I always look.  I want to know what's happening out there and what I have to do.  So I knew it the whole way around.  And I was trying really hard but it didn't happen.
Q. Overall, four sub-70 rounds across the week.  It's been a good defence.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I felt like I played better and better each day.  Obviously I wanted to keep going.
It's been a great week.  Feel like I've been playing some good golf.
Q. Nice to be taking some good form into the final two events of the year now in Nedbank and Dubai?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, definitely.  Hopefully I can finish strong and see if I can get that victory I haven't got this year, so I'm hoping.
