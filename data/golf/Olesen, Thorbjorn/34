 Q.  What's your verdict on the week?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Well, all in all it's been a good week.  Today was a little bit day and night to be honest.  Played really well this morning, and lost it a little bit here in the last 18.  Couldn't really find the fairways, and my putting was not particularly good.   
It was nice to finish with that four on the last.  That's definitely important.  But yeah, all in all, it's a good week.  To be out there in contention is always nice.  I wish I could have done a little bit more this afternoon and put some pressure on Henrik.   
 Q.  After the sorry stretch just around the turn, are you proud of yourself for the way you hung in there, because you still had a chance until the late, late stages.  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I did.  I had 3-putted 8, and like I did this morning, unfortunately, and that just started a bad run with three bogeys in a row.  I made a few pars there and then birdied the two par 5s coming in.  But yeah, I'm proud of that.  Coming back after that stretch was not easy.   
 Q.  I take it the work that you are doing, at least this is a good evidence that things are going in the right direction.  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, definitely.  Still need to work a lot more on it.  Showed here and there in the afternoon it, I got a little bit tired in the legs and I just couldn't really find the swing, especially with the driver.  So yeah, I need to get back there next week and work a little bit before Thursday next week.
