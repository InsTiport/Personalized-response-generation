Q. Your best finish this year, in the Sixes with a partner, doesn't count as by yourself.  Sum it up for us, if you will.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I still count that as a win, definitely.
It's funny actually, I didn't feel great on range.  Been struggling a little bit.  Practised really hard the last week or so.  And then I just relaxed when I got on the golf course.  Totally relaxed and I hit good shots.
Yeah, I played well.  It was a really nice feeling.  Sometimes you hit it great on the range and all of a sudden you get on the golf course and you hit a couple of bad shots and you're struggling.  Today was the other way around, which was a really nice experience.
Q. You were struggling.  What were you struggling with, and tell us how you fixed it.  Give us a little tip here.  We all want to know.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I don't really know to be honest.  Like I said, I felt really relaxed as soon as I stepped to that first tee.  Hit a great drive and that gave me a bit of confidence and from there on, I felt good out there.  We had a good three ball, which was nice, also.
But like before, just in the warm up, I couldn't really get the feel.  I wasn't really striping the ball.  Was just struggling a little bit.  But I know I've been working really hard, like I said, the last week or so.  So I knew it was going to come at some point.
It was actually my caddie who said, "Go down the right of the water," and I said, "No, I want to hit driver left."  I just caught it a bit high in the face, and I was like, oh, is it going to make it or not.  But luckily it did and it turned out really well.
I tried to pump a 7-iron in there, and you know, the pin was tucked all the way back, so I was trying to hit it five or seven yards short of the pin.
Q. 66, you must be pleased with that today.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I'm very pleased.  It's funny, I didn't feel that great on range when I warmed up today.  Just struggling a little bit to strike the ball.
But as soon as I stepped on the first tee, I felt very relaxed, and then I just hit a good drive and that gave me a bit of confidence and I just played well from there.  It was nice to see that.  Sometimes you hit it great on the range and you get on the course and you hit a couple of loose shots and you lose a bit of confidence.  Today was just the other way around, which was a really nice experience.
Q. What was the key to the game today?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It was just all around.  I hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  I think I missed a couple of greens only, which was nice.  But no, just kept it in play.  Like I said, I was very relaxed and enjoyed it out there, and that was definitely the key.
Q. Only one dropped shot on 17 but you made it back immediately on 18?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I hit a loose shot on 17 and that's what happened.  Short-sided myself and it was a bogey.
Yeah, I mean, 18, I hit a good drive.  I was not really sure, I caught the driver a little high in the face, so I was not sure it was going to carry.  But it did and it turned out very well.  Yeah, it was a nice finish.
