 Q. You've finished Top‑10 here before; how does it suit you?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I think is suits me great.   It's quite long and you need to be straight; and then the greens are tricky, and then I find it really easy the first two days to read the greens.   But today I struggled a little bit.   But it was a good day.   I played really solid today.   
   
 Q.   Talk about your development over the last year or, so you've gradually been sneaking up the World Rankings.   How much more comfortable do you feel in this position heading into tomorrow?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, yeah, I've been there a few times now.   I won last year and that gave me a lot of confidence, and I had a few second places.   
So I'm learning in every tournament, and it's been a really good process the last three years.   Hopefully I can make a few birdies tomorrow and make it exciting.   
   
 Q.   What's the game plan?   Do you treat it like match play and you're a couple behind or couple down standing on the first tee?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No, I'm going to try to be aggressive tomorrow.   I thought I was pretty aggressive today but I didn't hole the putts I needed to.   But I played well, and hopefully I can make a few more putts tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   You're looking very comfortable out there, is that a result of the hard work in the off‑season or because you like the course?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I love this place, first of all.   I had a long break, I had three or four weeks' break, and then I practised really hard the last two or three weeks.   I just found something to focus this week.   I didn't play well last week but on the range, I started hitting it really well first couple of days.   So it's been really solid for me.   
   
 Q.   What did you find?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I don't know, just starting to strike the ball really nicely.   I hit a lot of balls; sometimes that's what you need to do.   
   
 Q.   So do you feel good about your chances now to chase down Justin tomorrow?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It looks like he's playing really well, but if I can get some birdies in quickly, I think it can be exciting.   
   
 Q.   It's been a disappointing week for Nike in some regards, but they must be very pleased with you; you're obviously pleased with their equipment.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I'm enjoying their equipment.   I think it's great, so yeah.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the way you finished to prove up into that prominent position.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It's nice to finish this way.   I missed a few putts out there but yeah it was really nice to finish with a birdie and only two behind.   He will probably make birdie on the last, but I'll definitely have a chance tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   And a very good, solid day, despite the fact others are shooting low, you've kept your position on the board.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I've not made a bogey the last 36 holes and that helps.   I thought I had a few more chances today, especially I hit a lot of greens.   Didn't roll in for me today, but hopefully tomorrow they will roll in nicely.  
   
 Q.   Elaborate on that lack of a bogey, because that is something special around here, isn't it.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It is.   The rough is very tough, and if you get in there, you almost don't have a chance to hit the green.   It's not an easy golf course, so it's been pretty amazing to make a bogey.   
   
 Q.   How are you in this kind of position?   Do you relish it?   It's obviously why you play the game.   But we have seen you there repeatedly now and you seem pretty comfortable.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   So I'm learning every time I'm up there, and that's important.   And hopefully I can do better tomorrow than I did last year here, that would be nice.  
   
 Q.   What about the prospect of playing with Justin Rose?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   That would be nice.   I've never played with Justin I think, so definitely it will be nice to go out with him tomorrow.
