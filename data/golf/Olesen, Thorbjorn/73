 Q.   Thoughts on a prominent finish like this.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It was nice to finish with the birdie but a disappointing day for me, really disappointing.   Didn't go my way, didn't get the wind right.   Just not good enough today.  
   
 Q.   Looked like you were trying and just didn't click?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   No, I was trying on every hole, but it didn't work for me today.  
   
 Q.   You are always aiming for the top of course but when you reflect on the way the start of the year has gone, there's a lot of positives, aren't there?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I've been up there the last three weeks and it's been nice, but yeah, I'm still disappointed by today.   But he played great and he deserved this win.
