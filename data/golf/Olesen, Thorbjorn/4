 Q. A little disappointed on the last shot, but a pretty good day for you?  
THORBJORN OLESEN: Yeah, very disappointed. I hit two great shots and got the read wrong and it went over the green and had a really tough chip. So obviously very disappointed. But felt good today, like I did the first two days. I watched a few more putts today that dropped in, which was nice. So, yeah, it was nice round.  
   
 Q. What has the difference been for you between today and yesterday?  
THORBJORN OLESEN: Yeah, the weather has been perfect until the last two or three holes, the wind picked up a little bit and was swirling around. But the conditions were great. And it's very scorable when there's no wind.  
   
 Q. Still a way to go, but you're in a nice position going into Sunday?  
THORBJORN OLESEN: Yeah, obviously, like you said, there's some low scores out there, so it would have been nice to have been a few shots closer. But, yeah, pretty happy with the way I've played the first three rounds. So hopefully go out tomorrow and we'll see what happens. Hopefully I'll go out and shoot a good score.
