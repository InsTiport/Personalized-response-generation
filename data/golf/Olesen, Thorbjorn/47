 Q.  Five birdies in seven holes, what was responsible for that burst of good scoring?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: The putter really.  I played all right all 18 holes but those seven holes, started rolling the putter very nicely.  The greens are pure out there and if you find the lines, you're going to hole some putts.   
 Q.  Unusual tournament in that you play three different courses in rotation.  How do you prepare?  Do you play all of them?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Actually I played 36 on Tuesday, so it's been a lot of golf.  But yeah I've played all three courses, so seen them.  But yeah, we know the courses pretty well.  Been here a lot of times.  So it's just to get a look at it and get the feel for the greens and see how it's playing.   
 Q.  Seen you on the range a lot recently as you normally are, you're a hard worker.  You seem to be hitting the ball particularly well?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: My bad shots have been bad and that's got a lot better the last three weeks here.  I've narrowed in my driver a lot.  Seem to hit it pretty well now and find a lot of fairways.  That's been my struggle and it's gotten a lot better over the last months or so.
