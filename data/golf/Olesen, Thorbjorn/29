Q. 3-under, what are your thoughts on that round?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I thought I played really, really solid.  Missed a few short putts there in the middle of the round.  Had some great chances for birdie, but when I holed that one on 14, it was very important because I missed quite a few before that.
So it was nice to see one rolling in and then making a few birdies in a row there, it was very important.
Q. You blitzed the course yesterday, with a new course record.  What was it playing like today?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It's obviously difficult.  I thought I did very well mentally.  I was very patient out there.  I felt like I was playing some great golf, a lot of good iron shots.  So yeah, I was really good mentally I think.
Obviously it's a shame with 18, but I just lost a little bit of concentration on that tee shot.  Felt like I've been hitting my driver and 3-woods really, really well, so I just lost a little bit of concentration.  You get in trouble quickly, so that's the key tomorrow.
Q. Seven-shot lead going into tomorrow.  How do you approach it?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, same as today.  Felt like I was doing a lot of good things today.  I was being aggressive.  The pin positions was very difficult today I thought, a lot of back pins, and we were just in-between clubs quite a few times, and it's very difficult to hit them close then.
Tomorrow I have to do the same, be aggressive, and see if I can make a few birdies.  That's the key.
Q. The fact that the lead was just four shots at one point, were you aware of what was going on on the leaderboard?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I'm a person that always looks at the leaderboard.  I think that's important.  I felt like I was playing really, really well.  I gave myself some really good chances on that front nine.  Felt like it could have been two or three shots better.
But it's difficult after yesterday, when you shoot such a good score, to come back and still keep making putts.  But no, I felt like I did really well.  I stayed patient and at the end of the round made some birdies in a row.
Q. Those putts on 14 and 16, was it, they were vital to really push on?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, exactly.  That one on 14 was very important, probably around 12-foot or something.  That was just to keep it going.  I felt like before that, I just left a few chances out there.  So it was very important to get that one in the hole.
Q. A lot of money obviously at stake tomorrow, but is that on your mind at all?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: No, it's not about the money.  This is The Final Series and it's a massive event and obviously it would be great to win it.  There's still 18 holes left and I really have to stay concentrated out there and stay in my own little zone.
Q. How do you sleep with a seven-shot lead?  Have you had one before overnight?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I've never had a seven-shot lead, no.  I felt a bit nervous when I went out today, also, because I've never been that many shots clear.  Yeah, it's a bit of a weird feeling, but I know it's not easy and there's a bunch of guys there, and it's possible to shoot a really low one out here.  Stay aggressive tomorrow and keep plugging away.
