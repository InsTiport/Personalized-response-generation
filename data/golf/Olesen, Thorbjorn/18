Q. You had a great start yesterday with a 65 and you shot low again, 6, nicely placed in the tournament.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I felt like the game was better today.  The first nine holes yesterday, I really struggled and my short game was in good shape, and that helped me a lot.
But yeah, today I felt like I was more stable and my bad shots was better.  Hit one bad drive there on 6 but that was about it.  I had opportunities to make birdies, so it was a lot more fun to play today.
Q. Is it nice having slightly softer conditions where you can be a little bit more aggressive into some of these greens?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, definitely.  Like I said, if you keep it in play, like on the fairway, just off, you still have a chance to hit them close.  That's what you need to do and I felt like I did that today.  So I had a lot of looks.  But got a bit breezy there, also, and made it a little bit trickier.
Q. Is this the kind of golf course that you enjoy playing?  It's two very different nines here, isn't it?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I love coming to Italy and play golf.  It's nice to come and play an old-fashioned golf course, and tree-lined and you have to shape the ball a little bit and yeah, I think it's nice to play one of these courses.
Q. Nice going into the weekend in contention at the top of the leaderboard?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, we'll see at the end of the day.  Just keep my process and keep trying to get better.  I've not had the best of seasons so far, so that's what I'm focusing on and try to get my game in a better state.
