  THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, I started out really nice.   I started on the 10th and I lipped‑out and from there on, I just holed the putts I needed.   I missed a short one on 7 but then I holed two beautiful putts on 8 and 9.   So it's a very good round, I played solid and I hit almost every fairway and kept the ball‑‑ a stunning day here in Scotland.  
   
 Q.   You say a stunning day, when you first appeared at the course, you knew there would be chances?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   When you see that little wind and the sun came out, I mean, it got quite warm actually out there, but it's a good chance to score I would say, definitely.  
   
 Q.   How familiar are you with the Old Course?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, I've played this tournament last year but that's it.   But I've played really well on Sunday last year, I think I had 66 and 68 maybe.   So I've shot some good rounds, and it's special to play here.   
   
 Q.   Everyone says it's special, because of the history, they don't always like it necessarily, but I think you've got a infections for it straightaway, haven't you?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I enjoy to be here.   I've grown up with seeing it on TV and actually being here in 2000 and watched the Open as a kid.   
So it was just a lot of history and I really enjoy to be here and play.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on shooting 9‑under and then seeing that there are guys at Kingsbarns, Brandon Grace at 12‑under, Victor due by son at 11 at the moment?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, there is really a lot of good chances today.   In this little wind, you can go low here.   Kingsbarns and St. Andrews.   
So I knew there was going to be a lot of guys shooting low, so I'm really pleased with my round, 9‑under is a great score still.  
   
 Q.   Of course it's always fun to go low, but is it fun in this competition, as well, with a different dynamic about it?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I have a great partner this week, Rob.   I played with him earlier in the season in Abu Dhabi.   He's just a lovely guy and I really enjoy to play with him, so that makes it easier to go out there.  
   
 Q.   Having played in Abu Dhabi, was that by choice to couple together again?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Actually we won that Pro‑Am, me and Rob, Al Naboodah.   Hopefully we can do it again here.   
   
 Q.   What do you know about him?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, he's a South African and owns a jet company.   That's about it.   Fun guy.
