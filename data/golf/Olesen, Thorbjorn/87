  THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   My putter was better today, it was, it definitely was.   But I hit the ball close.   I had two shots I hit inside three feet.   That makes it easier to make birdies.   But my putting was spot on.   I saved some good pars out there and that was important I think. 

Q.   I take it you've enjoyed all three days despite the masochistic nature of playing in these tournament conditions?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I qualified for The Open, so it's great, preparing me for The Open and playing links golf is great for me.   Unfortunately it's quite soft out there but it's a beautiful course. 

Q.   How much links golf do you get to play? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Not much.   Not much.   But I'm used to playing in a lot of wind, so I really like to play the links golf.   I think it's a lot of fun. 

Q.   Most people would say that it is the challenge; that you've got to play different challenge to what you're used to week‑in and week‑out?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Exactly.   Most of the times, par is a good score and I think that makes it good fun.
