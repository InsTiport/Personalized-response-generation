  THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It's been a great week and I love the place.   Unfortunately a few shots too many, but it's been a great week for me. 

Q.   That was a lovely chance to have at the last. 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it was quite a long putt actually.   But I just miss‑read it and I thought it was left‑to‑right, but it was almost dead straight.   So that's what happens. 

Q.   Given the strength of this field, are you satisfied, can you reflect with the way you finished up? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, obviously second place is always good, especially when you have all the stars here, so it's a great week and I enjoyed playing with Justin.   Fantastic player. 

Q.   That's why you play this game, isn't it? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It is, to be in the final group, that's what I love.   So it was a nice day. 
I played really well the last few days, so got a lot of confidence.   I started out a little bit shaky, I hit a few bad shots on the second and third, but then came back strong.
Unfortunately I got a bad lie in the rough and hit a bad shot which cost me a double‑bogey which put me a little bit behind.   But I tried to fight back.   I mean, it's hard to be aggressive out there and it's hard to make birdies, so could maybe have holed a few more putts. 
But Justin could have made that, also.   So unfortunately we didn't do it. 

Q.   Were you trying to force it there with the second shot at the 6th?   What happened? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I was trying to go for the green but I knew the lie was bad and I tried anyway.   Maybe I should have just laid up, but you can always say that after.   I tried to make birdies today, and I didn't make that many unfortunately. 

Q.   The putt on 18, obviously a lot of people are thinking about Justin Rose's chance, but you had a very good try, as well.   Was it just a miss‑read?   What happened? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Definitely a misread, I thought it was left‑to‑right and it was almost dead‑straight.   But there was a lot of putts I could have holed instead of the last one, so it was not that one that cost me the victory.

Q.   In the big scheme of things, how important is a result like this for you? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Second place is always great but I would have loved to have won.   It was a great week for me and I love this place.   I think it's one of the best courses we play on the whole year.
