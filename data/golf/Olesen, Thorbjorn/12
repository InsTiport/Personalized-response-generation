 Q.  67 today, how was that for you?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I felt like I hit it better.  I was struggling a bit with my game the last couple weeks.  Yeah, struggling in the first round also and yesterday, but managed to make a few birdies yesterday and gave me a little confidence and I played a lot better today, so it was nice.   
 Q.  Any particular part of the game you're not happy with?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I just haven't been striking my irons.  My irons have been poor.  Actually, I've been driving it okay.  But it just seems like this week, especially today, I drove it really well and it was easy iron shots I had.  But yeah, it was definitely better.   
 Q.  Sixth in The Race to Dubai with the last four tournaments to play.  Is that in your mind, winning that?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I'm quite a long way behind, so I would need to do something really special to win it.  But you know, I go into every tournament to try and win it, and it would be special to win one of the last three events.   
 Q.  Feelings better going into the last round better than the start of the week?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, for sure.  I feel better after today.  I feel like I was a bit more comfortable with my swing.  Like I said, I've been struggling a bit, so this is definitely a move in the right direction.
