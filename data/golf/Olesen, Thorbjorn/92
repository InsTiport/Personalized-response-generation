  Q. What's the verdict on the day?  
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Hit a couple of loose shots. Holed a few good putts, and that saved the round, so that was nice.  
  
  Q. You said earlier in the week this is the best course you've played so far on The European Tour. Why do you feel like that?  
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: You get under pressure on every hole and you really have to hit good shots all the time. I think it's a great course.   
  
  Q. This is your first year on The European Tour, how has it measured up to your expectations?   
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: We get to play some good courses and everything is nice.   
  
  Q. People are saying things about you and expecting big things for your future. What are you expecting from yourself?  
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I'm expecting some good stuff, also. My swing is getting better and better, so hopefully soon, something big.  
  
  Q. Are you ready to win one as big as this?  
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: I hope so.   
  
  Q. How was it today?  
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It was all right. The first nine I played good and then I hit a couple of loose shots and got punished. I made some good putts and that saved the day. So that was nice.  
  
  Q. The course is firming up a little. Is it getting harder to score?  
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: The greens are getting a little bit harder so that maybe the end of the day -- it's pretty much similar to yesterday.  
  
  Q. The course seems to be quite challenging scores, are you surprised scores are not as low as maybe in other tournaments?  
 THORBJÃRN OLESEN: No, I'm not. It's a tough course this one. You really have to keep it in play and you have to be on it all the time and make some putts, also. I'm not surprised.
