 Q. Better day for Denmark, Søren is 4‑under for the day and you're 4‑under at halfway. What's your sense of your position?  
THORBJØRN OLESEN: Well, I'm happy. It was a fight for me all day. I mean, the first nine was bad weather, and actually I did all right in the bad weather. I think I was 3‑under at one point. But yeah, I'm not hitting the ball like I should do and it's a bit of a fight out there.   
   
 Q. So you were scrambling well?  
THORBJØRN OLESEN: Yeah, I'm hitting a lot of shots in the right direction, but it just doesn't feel that comfortable. And yeah, it's not easy to play golf when I'm fighting a lot, and I'm doing very well for how I'm hitting the ball, I would say.  
   
 Q. So 4‑under is the best you could be for 36 holes?   
THORBJØRN OLESEN: I don't know about that. There's still a lot of missed putts yesterday. But yeah, I'm just happy that I'm keeping fighting and keeping my head high and keep grinding.  
   
 Q. What's your assessment of the overall experience then?   
THORBJØRN OLESEN: I think it's great. You know, it's a good atmosphere out there today. Even with the rain this morning, there was still guys out there cheering you on. You see your own flag and you see all the other flags out there, people hanging them around their neck and stuff like that. That's a great atmosphere.   
   
 Q. Different from ordinary golf?   
THORBJØRN OLESEN: Yeah, it's a bit more of an achievement, and you can see your countrymen out there. It's very special and it's very nice to try and makes you work even harder to do some better shots.
