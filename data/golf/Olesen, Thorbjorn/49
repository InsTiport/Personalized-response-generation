 Q.   What do you take from the day?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Played well.   Then all of a sudden I 3‑putt the 12th.   I was going so well and hitting great shots and holing great putts, and then all of a sudden a stupid 3‑putt coming in and got me back a little bit.   I came back with two birdies, and then two balls in the water on 18 is a shame.   But it was a good day and then to ruin it on 18 was unfortunate.   
   
 Q.   Still kind of in the mix heading into tomorrow.   How do you low do you really think you need to go tomorrow?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, that birdie on 18 or a par would have helped.   Now I'm quite far back, and, well, if I can get the start I did today, 4‑ or 5‑under after nine, you never know.   But that's a long way to go.   
   
 Q.   What is your verdict on the third round?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Played well on the first 11, 12 holes, and then I 3‑putt from nowhere.   I came in and I fought it back, and made two great birdies there on 15 and 17.   Then 18, two balls in the water was bad.   But yeah, I played well today.   
   
 Q.   Your performance is clearly good, you had five birdies in six holes, so presumably, there's a lot of positives to take?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, obviously when you catch me right after the round and I've finished with a double and a couple of stupid bogeys, it's a bad taste in my mouth.   But I played well and hit a lot of good shots, and holed some good putts, also.   There is a lot of positives, but right now, it's not the best.   
   
 Q.   But you know your ability so you know you can go low, and I know the leaders are moving away, but you're in the mix?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I'm still there.   But quite a long way back now, and you never know tomorrow, I'm going to go out there and try my best and we'll see what happens.
