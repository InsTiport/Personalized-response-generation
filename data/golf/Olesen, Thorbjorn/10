Q. That must have felt like a birdie, that great up-and-down.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, there was a couple of them today.  Started off hitting a poor second shot and got that one up-and-down, and got up-and-down on the second.  That sort of started my round.
I hit some good shots and made some good birdies.  But it was just key not to make bogeys today.  The course is very scorable when there's no wind and the greens are pure.  It was nice to have a clean card today?
Q. Something about this golf course that you love, a former winner, of course.  What suits your eye the best?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I think I feel comfortable on the golf course.  I know I've hit a lot of good shots on this golf course and I can sort of take that with me.  Managed to hit a few today.  But like I said, a few bad ones.  It was just key to keep getting up-and-down.
Q. Playing with Justin and Tommy today, how much do you feed off them, Justin in particular, when he's also going well?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, he's one of the best players in the world by far, and Tommy is also playing incredible.  We became pretty good friends at The Ryder Cup, so it was a fun group.  There was definitely a lot of good golf shots.
