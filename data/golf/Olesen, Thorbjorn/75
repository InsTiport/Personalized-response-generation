Q.   Thoughts on 4‑under par to start this tournament? 
    THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It was a very solid round, hit the ball pretty good and gave myself a lot of chances and no bogeys again today, so it was nice. 

Q.   Beautiful conditions?
    THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I mean, it doesn't get much better than this.   This is perfect golf weather and it's just nice to be out there. 

Q.   Well, nobody is shooting the lights out but there are so many good scores; is that because the course is still tough? 
    THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It is, I think definitely the greens are difficult to read, so I think that's the main thing why we don't shoot it that low today. 

Q.   How quick was it to get the disappointment of Sunday out of the system? 
    THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Just after a few days, I would say Monday, I forgot about it, but it's still a great week for me.   So came over it pretty easy.

Q.   So many positives, and your form is great?
    THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I don't make that many bogeys at the moment and that's definitely a positive.   And I think that there will be a low round very soon.
