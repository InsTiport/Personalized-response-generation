Q. You just beat Jordan Spieth to one I didn't remember first Ryder Cup point in a vital singles match.  How big a rush of adrenaline?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It was massive, getting down to the first tee, I was just -- I really wanted to win today.  I wanted -- obviously not playing yesterday, the boys played great and just wanted to get out there and get a point for Europe.
Q. Describe the atmosphere out here, these fans are just going mad.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: It's been unbelievable.  I played great on the front nine.  Holed some really, really good putts and the crowd were mental.  It's been so much fun.
