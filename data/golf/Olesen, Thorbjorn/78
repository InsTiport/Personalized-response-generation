 Q.   A bogey‑free round, that's got to be something to be proud of.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Really nice, especially with the round yesterday the way I finished with a bogey, so it's nice to get a bogey‑free round today.  
   
 Q.   Still not easy out there despite the weather being so good?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, I didn't play well on the back nine, but I got some good pars and that's important.   But I played well the front nine, and it was nice.
