 Q.   Fantastic result, how do you feel?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it was a fight today for me.   I didn't play well, but I was fighting on every shot.   When I hit a few good shots, I missed a few putts.   But it's a tough day for me.   I didn't really hit the ball like I wanted to, so it's a tough day so I'm happy to finish 2.   
   
 Q.   It's a very special tournament, not only playing with an amateur as a team partner but also playing the most wonderful links course in the world under perfect weather conditions; how did you enjoy that?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I love this tournament.   I was really lucky to have a partner like Rob.   We had a great time out there.   He's a fantastic guy and we had a lot of fun.   And then you get to play these three courses, it's just amazing.   And we get the weather with us, also.   It can't get any better than this.   
   
 Q.   Are you looking forward to going to Portugal next week and maybe get a title there?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, going to take the three first days with me, and also today, and hopefully I can do one spot better.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on finishing runner‑up to a man like that?   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Branden played great.   He missed a few putts, and he missed a few putts on the front nine but he holed some really good ones on the back nine.   He played great, and three amazing rounds the first three days.   
I struggled today.   I didn't hit the ball really good, and I didn't get the putter to roll, either.   So it was a tough day, so 4‑under is still a good score.  
   
 Q.   And yet despite a struggle, you put the pressure on.  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I was a little bit surprised, actually, he left a few putts out on the front nine, so all of the sudden to be tied with him, I was a bit surprised.   But I tried to hang in there, but I didn't hit it good enough to win this week, and that's it.   
I really like St. Andrews and I've played great every time I've played here.   I was trying to shoot a low one today, but I didn't play good enough.   
   
 Q.   Lovely one at the end, though, wasn't it.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It was.   I thought I had that last putt, and that would have been interesting to see Branden with the 4‑footer.  
   
 Q.   With him coming back to you on the road hole, and you very, very nearly holing, that could have been interesting?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it could have been.   I'm pleased to finish second.   It was a great tournament for me, and I had a lot of fun.   Congrats to Brendan.  
   
 Q.   You like the format?  
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I do.   I enjoyed it, and especially when I get a partner like Rob, it makes it even better.  
   
 Q.   And it's quite an achievement for himself, four victories in a season on The European Tour.   
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   It is.   He has it going right now.   It's amazing, four times this season, he's been great.   It's just unbelievable.
