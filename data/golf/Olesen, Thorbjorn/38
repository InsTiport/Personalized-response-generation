Q. Thoughts on the week?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: If you take it the start of the week, tied second is pretty good.  Obviously I had a lot of chances today but nothing really went in.  I missed that short putt on 10 which hurt a lot.  I never really got the pace on the greens.  Had a few good lines but then they were short.  When I got it to the hole, it was not a good line.  So it was just a little off there around the greens.
Q. Still that opportunity, a chance there right to the death pretty much.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, there was.  I mean, 16 got a little bit of a bad lie over the green.  Hit a great 3-wood in there.  It could have been on the green and an easy birdie and a chance for an eagle.  I gave myself chances there on 15, also, and 17, and I hit a bad second shot on 18.  I gave myself so many good chances.  That's always nice.
Q. You seem to be smiling out there just about all the time; looks like you're enjoying your golf once again.
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, I've tried to change my mental side a little bit, and I've really enjoyed this week from the start.  Even though I hit a few bad shots, I was still very good mentally.  That's a good sign and that's what I have to keep working on.
Q. Bodes well for 2016 when you're in this kind of mood, doesn't it?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN: Yeah, it's obviously a good start.  Didn't play that well last week but this is a very good start and looking forward to next week in Dubai, so hopefully we can make some good shots there.
