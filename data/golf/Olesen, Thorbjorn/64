  THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I haven't been up there in while, so it's nice to be there now.   I played really well last week and this week.   Holed a lot of putts and that makes it easier and from tee‑to‑green, I've been good.   Abu Dhabi I played good all four days but didn't really get anything out of it
It's really nice to be in this position

Q.   Despite the wind picking up, you are feeling a reward? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it was the same.   Didn't have any wind the first couple of days.   I think on this course, needs to be a little bit windy and when you're playing well, it makes it okay to play.   I enjoy it and hopefully we get a bit of breeze tomorrow.

Q.   You said we haven't seen you in a little while.   What's changed? 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   I struggled a bit in the middle of the season and end of the year last year.   I had a couple of injuries and I didn't really take that break.   I just carried on playing.   But I'm feeling about and my body feels strong and working hard.   The last couple of weeks we worked hard on the swing and changed quite a bit and it feels good, it feels very comfortable over the ball. 

Q.   And it's nice when that competitive spirit comes back, as well. 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, definitely.   You know, I've not been up in a long time, but I've been up there a lot of times.   Hopefully I can play great golf tomorrow and be consistent.
