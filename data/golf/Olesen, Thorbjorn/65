  THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Well, we played a course that was very soft and very attackable, so I mean, there's a lot of birdies out there. 
But you know, I played well today, and I think I missed one green only and I didn't get that one up‑and‑down.   Then it got pretty dark in the end and I 3‑putted 17 from a not very far distance unfortunately.   I played very solid.   Didn't really hole that many putts but hit it good from tee‑to‑green.

Q.   You certainly made up for it at the last in the fading light. 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   That three‑ or four‑footer was pretty long in the dark, but I'm pretty happy that I made it and hopefully got me an hour or two hours more in bed.

Q.   I imagine it's frustrating when you have to wait for three hours, but once you got out there, you just felt loose, did you?
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, it's no really problem.   We have a great players' lounge up there, and I just chilled out and had a bit of food and relaxed.   The course was great when we came out.   The greens were really good and the course, it was nice to get out there when it's drained and play a good course.

Q.   I haven't actually seen you up on a board for a little while, so it must be nice to be up there in The Final Series. 
THORBJÃRN OLESEN:   Yeah, for sure.   I've been working hard the last four weeks.   I've not been playing great and I've just started to work really hard and need to get back in and play some good golf again.   It's nice to shoot 6‑under.   It's been a while since I've been down there, so it feels good, and hopefully I can keep on going the next few days.
