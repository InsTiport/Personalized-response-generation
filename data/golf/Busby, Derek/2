Q. I know you wanted to be aggressive and you came out of the gate fast here.
DEREK BUSBY: Yep.  The way the course is set up I think you can get off to a quick start if you're aggressive.
I was aggressive again and made a 20-foot birdie putt on 1.  Really set the tone.  He hit a good putt on 2 for birdie; just missed it.
Then I made par on top of him there.
Then kind of got in a rhythm.  Again, short game kind of saved me today.  I did not strike it very well.  I've got some work to do.  To compete this afternoon I'm going to have to hit it a little better.
I don't think I made any bogeys until maybe the last hole.
Q. Yeah.
DEREK BUSBY: So all in all, good, solid round.
Q. Birdied 6 to go 4-up.
DEREK BUSBY: I did.  Let me get to 6.  6 they played with the tee markers a lot, so we laid back off that tee just because I had a good lead.  I hit a good 9-iron in there to ten feet to a conceded birdie there because he was going to make bogey.  So that one was a pickup on 6.
Q. You still like the changes you and Butch Harmon worked on?
DEREK BUSBY: Yeah, yeah.  I've got a little work to do on ball striking, but the good thing is I know exactly what I'm doing out there.  I know when the misses show up what causes them.  Just got to go put the work in on the range.
Q. There is a little backup because there has been some overtime matches today.  Do you know how to deal with that with all your experience?
DEREK BUSBY: Yeah, absolutely.  You learn in these events to pace yourself.  I didn't play many shots on the practice rounds; didn't warmup too long this morning.  It's all about conserving energy.  This afternoon will be hot.  It will be a good match whoever I play.
Patience will win and conserving energy will be the game plan here.
