 Q.  Derek and Stewart, obviously, you guys were playing a match against a fellow Mid-Am champion.  You figured it would be down to the wire, and it was.  Kind of overall, talk about how that went.  
STEWART HAGESTAD: How much of that do you remember?   
(Laughter.)   
He had a migraine in the middle of it.   
 Q.  Did you really?  
DEREK BUSBY: Yeah.   
STEWART HAGESTAD: Yeah, no, they're really good.  Any time you go -- not only two really good players, obviously, but two really good friends that obviously play a lot of golf and trust each other, you know that they've got kind of something extra that you're not anticipating.   
But, no, listen, they played great, and we threw a whole bunch at them.  Derek made the eagle when we needed it most.  And, dude, he fought so hard.  Literally on the back nine, he, like, comes over on 11, and he's like, I'm going to need you to play real hard for about an hour and a half.  I don't get migraines very often, and I'm about to have one.   
 Q.  Remember it happened at the Augusta Women's Amateur, same thing.  Were you having trouble seeing?  
DEREK BUSBY: Yeah, I couldn't see.  I get kind of black spots, and on the putt on 10, I looked down and couldn't see the ball, and it's always a process, those things.  I knew it was coming.  Luckily, he had some medicine.   
But I don't think that affected the match very much.  I think those guys played well, and we just didn't have enough.   
 Q.  What was your eagle on 17?  Did you knock it down in two?  
DEREK BUSBY: Yeah, hit a 5 iron about eight feet, six feet behind the hole and made it.   
 Q.  How far was your 5 iron from?  
DEREK BUSBY: 230 straight down.   
 Q.  Downwind?  Did you figure when you hit it, it was --  
DEREK BUSBY: I did, yeah.  It was the best swing I hit all week, when I needed it too.  So all in all, I think we just got beat.  I didn't do enough early in the middle of the round, and they were helping each other out and made one more than we did.   
 Q.  A lot of birdies out there.  Four ball, that's what you expect with two good players, two good teams.  
STEWART HAGESTAD: I don't know how many holes we tied, but it couldn't have been more than two or three.   
 Q.  It wasn't a lot.  
STEWART HAGESTAD: Look, they played great.   
 Q.  Your par at 18, how far was it?  
STEWART HAGESTAD: 15 feet.  It was a really, really good approach shot.   
 Q.  It was out of the bunker, right?  
STEWART HAGESTAD: Maybe the worst putt I've hit in 2019.  I wish I could have that one back.  Long in the wind could be a little tricky.  It hit me there.  We knew Matt was going to make birdie.   
 Q.  Did he make most of them out there today?  
DEREK BUSBY: Yeah, he did.   
STEWART HAGESTAD: Herb made a couple early, right?  So Herb made birdies on 1 and 3, and he made a great save on 16.   
DEREK BUSBY: He was probably 4 or 5 under on the back.   
STEWART HAGESTAD: Yeah.  I think Matt had most of the firepower, but Herb contributed early and freed him up a lot.   
 Q.  You guys have a couple extra days to get ready for a big Monday for both of you.  
DEREK BUSBY: Sectionals.   
 Q.  Yeah, 36 holes.  You're going to Georgia.  You're going back home, trying to qualify for a third straight.  
STEWART HAGESTAD: Yeah, yeah, that would be really nice.  It's anywhere.  Derek knows, you're trying to qualify for a U.S. Open.  So go out, prepare the best you can, try and go kick some butt.   
 Q.  Have you played in an Open?  
DEREK BUSBY: I have not.  Looking forward to it.   
 Q.  Guys, best of luck with your qualifying.
