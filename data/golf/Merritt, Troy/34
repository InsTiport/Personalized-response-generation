 Q.   Great round.   Moved up quite a bit.   Just talk about the day if you could.  
TROY MERRITT:   Yeah.   I didn't get off to a great start on the first hole, little shaky with the swing but settled down right away.   Nice to make a 25-footer on 2, kind of got me ready to go on the greens and made a couple putts that were outside ten feet, couple outside 20 feet.   Didn't really have to work too hard for pars today and got a little unlucky on 6 but, nonetheless, take 5-under.  
   
 Q.   Anything about the conditions today, were they less than yesterday or Friday?  
TROY MERRITT:   Yeah, the wind is down just a little bit, out of a little different direction.   Tough thinking about it, still.   Greens are still receptive.   Probably rolling a little bit better than yesterday.   Get your ball on line and read it the right, it's right around the hole.
