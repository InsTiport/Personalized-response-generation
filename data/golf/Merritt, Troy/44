  Q. Troy, great birdie at the 18th means you get two more cracks at 17, but at least you get to stick around for the weekend. Talk about your round today.  
 TROY MERRITT: Yeah, that birdie on 18 came one hole too late. But I'm happy to have it and be 4-under for the tournament. I don't know how I shot 1-under today. I was really inconsistent, especially the first nine holes.   
 Played a lot more solid on the back nine, didn't take advantage of the par-5s, and I don't know where the three birdies came from on the back nine, but I'm sure glad to have them.  
  
  Q. How aware are you of the fact that Rickie had made birdie there at 17?  
 TROY MERRITT: I thought we heard a little bit of a yell when we were standing back on 16 tee box. We didn't know exactly what it was because it sounded like three people yelled. So we didn't know what was going on.  
 Nonetheless, it really didn't take any consideration what I was going to do with the whole just because Bads was already tied with me. Now we got a three-way tie on top, and I'm kind of playing with house money, I guess you could say.  
  
  Q. Two more cracks at it. Most importantly you get to improve your position on the Money List as well. Great grinding out there.  
 TROY MERRITT: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
