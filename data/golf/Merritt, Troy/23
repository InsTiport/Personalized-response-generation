Q. 5-under 67.  Beautiful start today.
TROY MERRITT: Yeah, thank you.  I hit the ball really well off the tee with the exception of trying to make some new friends on 4-over in the houses, but ended up making par somehow on the hole and it was a good ball-striking today.
Had a lot of good looks at birdies and the putter was rolling nicely.  Hit a lot of good putts and found the bottom today.
Q. Speaking of hitting ball all off the tee, the way the course is setting up, it's crucial to be able to get the ball close to some of the hole locations.
TROY MERRITT: Absolutely, especially for me.  I'm average to below average off the tee with the driver.  I got to get in the right side of the fairway and semi attack the pins and stick them in the corners how firm the greens are getting.
It's definitely a strategic course for me.  I can't just bomb away.  So, it worked out today and we'll see if it works out the next few days.
Q. Tremendous start.  Get some rest.
TROY MERRITT: Yes.
