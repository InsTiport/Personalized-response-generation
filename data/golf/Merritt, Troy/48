  Q. You've had a couple of phenomenal days so far this week. Seaside, Georgia is a long way from Boise, Idaho. How did you adjust so quickly to this type of golf course?  
 TROY MERRITT: It's a lot different, totally, from Boise, when I was playing there for three or four years.   
 I'm not real familiar with Bermudagrass. First time I saw it was three or four years ago. And I love Bermuda greens, and I have for a few years now; and I've had a lot of success on them, won probably half dozen to 10 tournaments on them.   
 And I love rolling them. They roll really well for me. I like reading the green. It adds a different element. It helps keep your focus so you can hit a lot of good putts, and I think that's the main thing, just reading the greens and not hitting it in the rough.  
  
  Q. The attitude when you're around the 125 number is if I can just get myself in contention, I don't have to worry about that anymore. You've gotten yourself in contention.   
 TROY MERRITT: I have, and that's the main goal Thursday morning when you peg it in the first tee. And usually I don't get off to great starts.   
 This week I was able to do that and kind of had a rocky day yesterday, but today played pretty flawless golf. There was a few whoops-a-daisies, but you're going to have those every day, but to shoot 64, I'll take it.
