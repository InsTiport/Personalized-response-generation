 Q.  It's not the finish you wanted, but what's your biggest takeaway from today?  
TROY MERRITT: Oh, it's fun to be back in the mix.  For the most part we hit it pretty solid, and I didn't quite make the same putts I made the first two days.  I had been putting wayward the last six holes, really didn't have any looks, had to get up-and-down on all of them.  Struggled for pars instead of making birdies.  That was the big thing.   
But hat's off to Collin, to birdie four of the last five, including the last three.  That's pretty good.  He's a good champ.  I'm sure there's probably more to come for him.  But we gave it our best.   
 Q.  What was going through your head on that last chip on the 18?  
TROY MERRITT: I was hoping that that 8-iron would carry further.  It was right on line.  Figured we had to make eagle.   
And I knew we had to make the chip.  And a par wasn't going to hurt us.  So we gave it our best effort.  We thought it might go a little right on the green, went just a little bit left.  I don't know if it would have gone, even if it hit the stick, it had a little bit of speed.  But gave it a chance; didn't work out, try again next time.   
 Q.  Did you feel like you had added pressure going in as the overnight leader?  
TROY MERRITT: I didn't feel it too much.  Just wanted to go back out, see what I could do on a Sunday afternoon in the final group.  Would have loved to have got off to a better start, make a couple of birdies.  But we were there all day, just didn't get enough to go in.
