Q. To me you won this event.  You didn't back into the victory.  266 shots en route but a couple today were crucial.  I thought the par save on 8 was huge and the third shot into the par 5, 14. Talk us through that one.TROY MERRITT: Yeah, you know, I didn't learn my lesson from yesterday on 8.  I chunked a wedge again.  This time it ended up in the bunker instead of the green. Hit an okay bunker shot but that's the type that you don't want.  Slick downhill, going to break a couple cups.  Trying to find the line and hit it just hard enough to get it down the hill and luckily enough went right in the center. And tweaked that 9-iron a shade on 14.  I wasn't going at the stick but it ended up landing softly and about 20 feet was as good as I was going to do.  I was happy with that.Q. Now the course is playing really tough.  You really accelerated through the back-9.  We spoke about it before the round, your rhythm never changed even when the breezes picked up.  Speak to the discipline it took.TROY MERRITT: The worse type of wind condition for me is somewhere between 2 and 6 miles an hour.  I feel like I control the ball a little bit better, hit a lot more flighted draws in there and the pin is on the back.  It didn't call for that shot.  I stuck with it.  Accepted 30, 40-footers, some tough ones but, nonetheless, ended up getting the job done.Q. You got the job done.  Go enjoy it.TROY MERRITT: Thanks
