 Q.  Talk about that early run of birdies.  
TROY MERRITT: Rolled a nice 10-footer in for par and next couple holes made about a 22-, 24-footer for birdie on 11, another 20-footer on 12 and hit a beautiful hybrid in on 13 and nice wedge in on 14.   
It's nice to see putts going in early, especially from a little bit of length.  It kind of gives you confidence going forward the rest of the day and they kept going in.   
 Q.  You were able to have another three-birdie run in a row on your inward nine, so nice that you got off to a good start.  It's nice that you got off to a good start.  
TROY MERRITT: Yeah, I joked with my caddie.  We need to shoot 6-under or 10-under, and haven't shot 10-under for a little while.  Have a few of those on TOUR.  First time I shot 9-under.  Those three birdies in a row on our back side were nice, but the par save on 7 was big from 110 yards.  Kind of kept the round together and gave us a chance to post even better on 8 and 9.  A couple pars, but we're not disappointed with 62.   
 Q.  You're not quite the bubble boy, but at 72, you know you have work to do to get into the BMW, to get to THE TOUR Championship.  Is that on the back of your mind maybe at the start of the week, but once the round unfolds, it's just golf?  
TROY MERRITT: I didn't think about it a whole lot.  I know good golf will take care of itself.  You just try to play the best you can.  Obviously be watching throughout the weekend, but just getting off to a good start, put that to the back of the mind and try to win a golf tournament and do that, I'll get inside the Top-70.
