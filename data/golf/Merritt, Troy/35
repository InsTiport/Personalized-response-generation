Q.   Really solid round of golf.   Just never got much going on the back nine.   Fortunately ended with a birdie. 
TROY MERRITT:   Yeah, I was telling my caddie, Saj, before we hit the second shot on 18 that we were stuck in neutral and lulling everybody to sleep including ourselves.   It was nice to get that last one up‑and‑down.   The 2‑iron wasn't very good, but bad shots like that don't look as bad when you get them up‑and‑down.

Q.   Did you know what Jimmy was doing just in front of you?
TROY MERRITT:   I didn't hear much, but I knew he was playing well.   Obviously he's got great memories of this course, defending champ, very good player, Ryder Cupper.   You don't expect anything less, and it'll be tough to chase him down tomorrow.

Q.   The good news is that you can chase him down tomorrow.   You are still in touch with the leader. 
TROY MERRITT:   Yeah, I was telling Saj, I don't know what Jimmy had, but he probably had 10, 11 birdies today it seemed like, and maybe he got them all out today and we've got a chance to catch him on a cold spell tomorrow, and maybe we'll make some putts tomorrow, so we'll see.   It'll be fun to play with whoever we get paired with and just enjoy the ride for a fun round.
