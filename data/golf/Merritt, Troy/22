Q. Clean card until the 17th hole but a good par save.  How are you feeling about the round today?
TROY MERRITT: I feel pretty good about it.  The course was firmer than what we played yesterday.  I was able to get the ball into play off the tee with the exception of my last two holes.
I couldn't quite save the one on 8 but I was able to knock one in on 9.  Probably between those two you're probably going to make one of those two, missed the shorter one, made the longer one.
Overall, take anything in the 60s today.  Put us into a good position the weekend.
Q. Coming off a year where you got your first win, missed a few cuts this season.  How does it feel to be in contention heading into the weekend?
TROY MERRITT: Unfortunately, I've been making a habit of missing the cuts.  When I do make the cut I play really well and find myself up in the Top 20, 25.  Hopefully a good weekend this week and we'll just add them up in the end and see what happens.
Q. You're making your first start in the Arnold Palmer Invitational.  What's it like being in an event like this?  You've seen Arnie out on the range and how special his legacy here is.
TROY MERRITT: Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Anytime you can get your name involved in the tournament at the place that you love, that's pretty special.  Obviously Arnie is one of the greatest of all times and the people absolutely love him and us as players, we absolutely love him.  To be able to tee it up here for the first time is pretty special and hopefully can run into him here before the week is over.
