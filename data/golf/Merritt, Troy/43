 Q. You're sitting there watching Johnson and Mark finish. I mean it's quite a day, and at least you know right now you got exempt status, and then the drama is going to start in a second. Just a couple thoughts about just sitting there after you finished. Maybe talk about your putt there on the last hole.
 TROY MERRITT: Yeah, I didn't realize -- I mean I really wanted to make birdie just in case something like this happened, but it just didn't break quite as much as I thought, and it burned the edge. 
 But nonetheless, solid day, 67, no bogeys, take that for the final round of the year. And definitely didn't think it would take 67 to try and keep my card today, but nonetheless, very happy with that. And you gotta feel for Johnson, playing his heart out today, and had it there for a second and gave it back. But he's a good player; he'll rebound, and we'll see him out here next year I'm sure. 

 Q. Okay. And anything about just being right on the bubble? I mean you were the guy, and you had to sort of sit that out, the whole experience of that?
 TROY MERRITT: Yeah, you go from first step final stage of Q-School to the bubble boy, number 125, the last one in. 
 It doesn't matter. It gives me better status next year than I had this year. So definitely looking forward to next year now.

 Q. Well, good luck on the hole-in-one.
 TROY MERRITT: Thank you.
