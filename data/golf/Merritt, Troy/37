Q.   A great bounce back after an early start with a couple of bogeys.   You end up making six birdies and shooting 66.   What turned your round around?
TROY MERRITT:   You know, I just had a poor lay‑up on 12 right into the bunker.   You never want to have a 90‑yard bunker shot, especially from a par‑5 coming in from the middle of the fairway, and didn't hit a good wedge and made a bad bogey there, and just tweaked my tee shot on 14 and one‑hopped into the water.   But other than that my swing felt good all day and just kind of settled down on the greens.   I didn't really have to make any long putts.   I hit a lot of really close iron shots, especially on the end of the back nine, beginning of the front nine, and played pretty stress‑free golf minus those two swings on the first five holes.

Q.   As you mentioned near the end of your front nine at 15, 16 and 17, you birdied three in a row, parred 18, then you birdied 1 and 2.   You obviously had to feel like you were in the groove there.   What were you feeling?
TROY MERRITT:   You know, sometimes when I'm making birdies they kind of come in bunches, and today was just one of those days.   The swing felt really good.   I didn't have a lot of full iron shots, kind of a couple 80, 90 percent iron shots, but nonetheless they were right on the stick, got them inside eight feet, five feet, and then three feet, and it feels pretty good when you can hit them in there and then see them go in.   Sometimes it's just a domino effect, one right after another.
