Q.  Juli, five shots back, a tough front runner and Karrie Webb.  But you've come from that far back before and won, I wonder your thoughts.
 
JULI INKSTER: Karrie is playing great.  I played with her today and she played awesome.  I'm going to have to start hitting the ball better to give it a shot.  Hopefully in the next couple of days I can figure out my swing and give her a run. 
 

Q.  You had it going today.  What's the strategy?  You're a veteran, you're cool, you can't make it up all at one time.  Are you going to chip away and keep working?
 
JULI INKSTER: I've got to drive the ball better and hit better iron shots today.  I made two birdies on my first two holes, but one was out of the weeds.  I've got to drive the ball better, and that's the bottom line.
