 Q.  Talk about your round today. 
 JULI INKSTER:  Disappointing because I didn't play well.  I three-putted 13, two good shots on 14 and 15 and didn't make birdie, so that kind of hurt.  And then I bogeyed 16, I hit it in the water on 17, so kind of frustrating. 

 Q.  Were you able to play defensively today? 
 JULI INKSTER:  You can't.  You can't.  I hit good shots coming in.  You know, on 16 the wind is going right to left, I hit it on the right side and I blocked it a little bit, and 17 the same way, I blocked it. 

 Q.  What did you hit there? 
 JULI INKSTER:  I hit 7-iron.
