  Q.  The course is playing tough?   
 JULI INKSTER:  Yeah, it's tough, but it's very fair.   
  
  Q.  How did your game go?   
 JULI INKSTER:  My putting stinks.  Can I say that?   
  
  Q.  You're being candid.   
 JULI INKSTER:  I didn't cut well.  I made bogeys, had some good irons, my putting just -- you know, I 3-putt on one hole.   
  
  Q.  What part of your game is giving you the most trouble?   
 JULI INKSTER:  All of it.  It's just not flowing right now.  I'm hitting good irons, and I hit three bad drives, and I got punished for them.   
  
  Q.  Do you think it's the putting or --   
 JULI INKSTER:  Yeah, my putting is really bad.   
  
  Q.  How are you going to change that?   
 JULI INKSTER:  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure that out.   
  
  Q.  Maybe it's the club --   
 JULI INKSTER:  I don't think it's the putter; I think it's the puttee, unfortunately.   
  
  Q.  Annika was talking about the lengthening of the course.  Is that a factor?   
 JULI INKSTER:  Oh, yeah, it's a big factor.  Instead of 8-irons, 9-irons, I'm using 6-irons, sometimes 5-irons, and the ball is not rolling much in the fairways, either.   
 It's pretty tough out there, but, you know, it's a Major.   
  
  Q.  Have you hit more club this year than you have in the past?   
 JULI INKSTER:  You used to be able to get there in two; you can't now.  The 3 I hit more club, 5 I hit more club, 7 I hit more club, 9 -- there's like 8 holes in the back --   
  
  Q. (Question regarding the length of some holes.)   
 JULI INKSTER:  It's more than two shots to get there.  A couple of them you can, but I was having trouble getting to the corner here on 9, you know?   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JULI INKSTER:  Yeah, but I hit my driver and a 3-wood.  It's different.   
  
  Q.  You know this course pretty well?   
 JULI INKSTER:  Uh-huh.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the Pro-Am and what that means for the players.   
 JULI INKSTER:  It means Monday you have to get in here and play.  You've got to travel on Sunday night to get here Monday, play on Monday, and Pro-Ams --   
  
  Q.  You have to get here earlier?   
 JULI INKSTER:  It's hard to do that.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 JULI INKSTER:  No, I think they have, like, 7 tournaments.   
  
  Q.  It's been around for a while.   
 JULI INKSTER:  Yeah, it's been around for a while.  I think it's time we changed it.  A two-day Pro-Am?  It's hard to do.   
  
  Q.  I'm wondering if you would like to see any changes as far as the timing of tournaments -- like, for instance, play a Pro-Am on Saturday or --   
 JULI INKSTER:  We can't play here on Saturday.  (Chuckles.)   
  
  Q.  Oh, there's something that prevents that?   
 JULI INKSTER:  Another one of our silly rules.
