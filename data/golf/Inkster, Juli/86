 Q. So tough end to the day. Just tell us about --
 JULI INKSTER: Yeah. Yeah. I just edged my shot and I missed it and I just missed it to the right. It was a three-quarter shot, and I just left it out there. 
 And you know, I played well all day. So you know, Jimin birdied the last hole. She played well. 

 Q. You had a nice round of birdies there. 
 JULI INKSTER: Yeah, I did.

 Q. I think it was four or five to get yourself in the hunt. 
 JULI INKSTER: Yeah. You know, I three-putted 10 for bogey, and I had a birdie chance on 11 and didn't make it, and I made a few coming in. 
 I putted pretty good all day. You know, I just hit a few loose shots, and that happened to be one of them.

 Q. Seems like you've put yourself in contention a couple times this year. You had a chance in the finals. 
 JULI INKSTER: Yeah. Well, one, I got DQ'd and a couple other ones. You know, I'm playing a lot better. Just my swing just doesn't repeat. I just gotta keep working at it.

 Q. Does it make you want to stay out here? No thoughts of --
 JULI INKSTER: Well, I mean I really enjoy what I do. This is great traveling here to Malaysia. They treat us great, and it's a nice feel to compete and maybe next time.

 Q. All right.
