 Q.  Assess your day today, please.  
JULI INKSTER: I struggled with the putting again.  I had three three-putts from nowhere.  I didn't hit the ball as good today, but I still hit it good enough to score better than I scored.  I just keep throwing them away on the greens.  But tomorrow I've got to play a great round in order to win.   
 Q.  Is there a number in mind, or just a great round?  
JULI INKSTER: I just can't throw them away.  I've got to shoot probably at least 4- or 5-under to win.   
 Q.  Is that asking too much of yourself --  
JULI INKSTER: No, shoot, it's doable.  Playing too good to shoot the scores I'm shooting.   
 Q.  The ball-striking is what's the best right now?  
JULI INKSTER: Yeah, I'm driving the ball well, and I didn't hit my irons as well today, especially coming in, a couple of mine were left to the right, but I've been hitting my irons really well.   
 Q.  Is it kind of a feeling of semi-frustration?  
JULI INKSTER: It's a huge feeling of semi-frustration.  But you know what, I can't do anything about it, I've just got to go try to be better tomorrow.   
 Q.  I mean, the position is probably in your mind good but not great.  Is that kind of fair to say?  
JULI INKSTER: I'm just doing a lot of things good except my putting, and you can't score unless you -- you've got to putt well, and I'm just not doing that right now.  But I've got to figure out something by tomorrow.
