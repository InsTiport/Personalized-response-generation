JULI INKSTER:  I mean, she just played better.  That was the bottom line.
Q.  Do you think she showed pretty good poise for a 19 year old?
JULI INKSTER:  Yeah, she's been playing longer probably than I have.  She's probably played more tournaments than I have.  They start them young over there.  I mean, if I putt anywhere halfway decent, it's mine.  But she played good.  What can you do?  It's golf.
Q.  It looked like on 14 she had a great approach.
JULI INKSTER:  I went for it yesterday.  I hit it on in two and made birdie.  So I stuck to my game plan and I hit a great shot.  I just had trouble getting the ball to the hole all week.  My chip shots and my putting, that was the difference.
Q.  Is it a surprise to see the top seeds falling?
JULI INKSTER:  Match play, anything can happen.  This is the type of golf course where you just kind of hit it anywhere, so it brings a lot of people into play.

Match play, just someone needs to get hot for a stretch, and it's tough to get it back.
Q.  Would you describe it was freaky?
JULI INKSTER:  It's golf.  It's just golf.
