JULI INKSTER: I putted really good today.
Q. Great putt on the last.
JULI INKSTER: Yeah, and I hit the ball like crap.  I've been hitting the ball so good, and I drove the bad really bad today.  I played defensive all day.  But very happy with even par today.  Could have been a lot worse, so I feel -- just go back and try to work on something with my swing.  I'm just excited that I actually putted pretty good today.
Q. I knew you were concerned about putting coming in.
JULI INKSTER: Yeah, I missed a short one on 1, but other than that, a lot of good par putts.
Q. Was it the driver --
JULI INKSTER: My driver.  I think I probably only hit maybe four fairways, which -- that's probably been my best club all year.  I don't know, I think I just got a little bit out of sorts, and we'll go hit some on the range and figure it out.
Q. Did you find you had a little extra adrenaline than normal playing in this inaugural event?
JULI INKSTER: Not really, no.  I mean, I didn't.  You know, it's just Thursday you kind of don't want to shoot yourself in the foot.  It's a long four days, and I'm just ecstatic that I shot even par today.  Could have been a lot worse.
Q. A lot of long putts that you had to judge really closely?
JULI INKSTER: Yeah, maneuver.
