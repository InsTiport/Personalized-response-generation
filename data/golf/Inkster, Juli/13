Q. What was different today than yesterday?
JULI INKSTER: I putted better today.  I didn't have any three-putts, no four-putts, hit a lot of greens.  I think I hit 17 greens.  I think I hit every fairway.  I hit the ball very well today and gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Didn't really cash in, but I felt like I rolled the ball better today.
Q. Was the putting better -- was it a technical thing or was it being more comfortable, more familiar with these greens?
JULI INKSTER: Brian worked on my putting last night with me trying to smooth it out a little bit, kind of take the hit out of it a little bit, trying to roll it a little bit more, kind of get the feel back.
Q. What do you think the weekend -- is par a good score?
JULI INKSTER: Yeah, I mean, I don't know how they're going to set it up, but I would say -- I mean, I knew I had to shoot under par today just to kind of get myself back into it.  So I accomplished that.  It's just tough getting behind the 8-ball so early.  But I feel like I'm playing well.  I've just got to make a few putts.
Q. Were any of the par saves as good or better than the birdies you made?
JULI INKSTER: I really -- I mean, the only par save I had, the only green I missed was on 4.  I hit my drive in the junk, and had a bunker shot and had to make a five-footer.  That was really -- all the rest of them were tap-ins or three-footers.  I made a really good birdie putt on 5, about 20 feet.  So that was nice, unexpected.
