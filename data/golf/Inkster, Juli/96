 Q. Juli, sounded like that was an incredibly exciting match out there. 
 JULI INKSTER: Yeah, we both played really well. You know, I just couldn't get really a putt to go in that front side, and I was 2-down and I just kind of hung in there and missed a shorty on 12 to go 2-down. And then I birdied 14, 15 and 16, and then she bogeyed 17 to go 1-up, and then I dumped it in the lake here.
 I played really well today, so I'm very excited. 
 Q. There's been talk that this potentially could be your last Solheim Cup. 
 JULI INKSTER: It is.

 Q. Are you saying that definitely?
 JULI INKSTER: Well, I'm not doing a Brett Favre, but it is. I want to come out and watch. These girls are great. They've got a lot of young talent, and it needs to be passed down right now. But I had a great time, and I'm glad Beth and Meg thought enough of me to pick me. It's been a great ride.

 Q. Would being a captain in the next few years be a huge goal for you?
 JULI INKSTER: Yeah, it definitely would be. I would love to do it. I'd love to be able to pick out the uniforms and hair ribbons and stuff like that. That's my forte.

 Q. You're good at that. 
 JULI INKSTER: Yeah, I would love to be a captain someday.
