JULI INKSTER: I'm telling you right now, it's just not right.  You just don't do that to your peers.
Q. What was the reaction immediately afterwards?
JULI INKSTER: I couldn't believe it.  I thought it was good, too.  I saw Charley walk off.  I saw Suzann turn her back.  And then Suzann said she didn't give it to her.  If that's the way they need to play to win, we'll just try to do our best out there today.  They didn't even have to do it, they were winning anyway, it was tied.  They should have birdied 18.  I don't get it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JULI INKSTER: I did.  I did instruct her to do something, but she didn't.  So we'll just move on from there.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JULI INKSTER: It's a done deal now.  And you know what, we don't want it now.  If they wanted to do it, they should have done it then.
Q. Have you talked to Carin, yourself?
JULI INKSTER: No.
Q. How fired up is your team is the question?
JULI INKSTER: They're fired up, but, you know what, they were fired up before, too.
