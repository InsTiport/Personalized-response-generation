Q.
To be down and have to come back?
JULI INKSTER:  It was tough to be out there and start.  I was really nervous at the start.  It's hard to keep your    it's hard to golf.  You're out there and you have all your teammates there, and all of a sudden you walk off the first tee and it's a tough feeling.

I let her back in the ball game on 8 and 9 and on 10, I don't know where that came from.  I made a great birdie on 11.  I stuck it on 13.  She gave me a little bit on 14.  I had a great shot on 15.  I just kept hitting great shots.
Q.  13 and 14, the two holes that are going to favor the monster that she is, what's that about?
JULI INKSTER:   Oh, God, she    the thing is is that she's hitting 50 yards off mine and she's got a straight shot in.  It's    you're hitting the fairway, you're hitting the fairway, you're hitting the fairway.  I know how Rosie Jones feels now.  I was totally the tortoise and she was the hare.

And Rosie goes, you know who won that, don't you?
