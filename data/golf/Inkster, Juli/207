Q. What was the key to your round?
 
JULI INKSTER:  We started out real well by hitting fairways and greens.  We hit every green until No. 6.  6 was the key because we thought we were going to lose a hole because we made bogie, but then Davies put her shot into the bunker and they made bogie as well, so that saved us.  We thought overall we played good, stayed patient on a couple of holes and grinded it out.  The one bad part of the round was some of the putting.  We 3-putted 10, which killed us.  You can't 3-putt in alternate shot.
