Q.
Now, you were sent out first.  It wasn't a surprise to too many people.  You were sent out to get that valuable first point and to make a statement.  You came up big.
JULI INKSTER:  Yeah, I did.  On the back side I hit the ball phenomenal and gave myself a lot of chances.  I didn't putt great, but I did what I needed to do.
Q.  All the matches got tied, but now it looks like they're all going your way.
JULI INKSTER:  Great, that's what we needed to do.  Paula went out there and didn't break a sweat.  I'm glad to get a win.  Go USA
