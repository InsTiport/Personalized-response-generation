Q.   Gotta be pretty pleased with 68 today. 
JULI INKSTER:   Yeah.   I played really well.   I drove the ball good, putted pretty good.   Yeah, I was happy.

Q.   15 years after the big win here, what would it mean to win here?
JULI INKSTER:   Well, I got a long way to go, but to win anywhere would mean a great deal, especially I'm not playing that much anymore.   It feels good to get out here and play.

Q.   I was going to say, you're not playing much anymore, but great finish at the Open, great finish here.   Does that give you any thought of playing more at all?
JULI INKSTER:   No.   I just like what I'm doing now.   It's a great balance for me.   Yeah, it's good.

Q.   How much do you get to practice, doing Golf Channel?
JULI INKSTER:   Well, it's hard.   I feel like I got two jobs.   But done with Golf Channel this year, so I've been able to practice a little bit more.

Q.   Does watching it give you any different sense out there do you think?
JULI INKSTER:   Yeah, watching it really helps.   You just realize how good these girls are, and they don't make any mistakes, so you've just gotta plod away.

Q.   What's your strategy going into tomorrow?
JULI INKSTER:   Keep doing the same thing I'm doing.   I hit the ball pretty good, putted pretty good.   Didn't really make any mental mistakes, so that was nice.

Q.   Is it tougher out there in the afternoon with the poa annua?
JULI INKSTER:   Yeah.   The greens are bumpy. 
But I mean the course is in great shape.   You know, it's firm, and you just gotta play for that.
