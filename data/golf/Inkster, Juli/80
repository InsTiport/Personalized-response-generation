 Q. Can you tell me about your hole-in-one?
 JULI INKSTER: The pin was back left. My ball mark was probably 15 feet short of it. It just kind of went in. I didn't see it. In competition I think that's my fourth. I think my ninth or tenth all-time.

 Q. What do you think of the level of Lexi Thompson's play?
 JULI INKSTER: Oh, my God. It's incredible. She's 16. I didn't even start until I was 15, so she's a good player. She hits it long. She's got a good touch. She works on her game. You know, it's incredible.

 Q. If she's able to complete this and win this tournament as a 16 year old, what would that mean for this sport?
 JULI INKSTER: It means we got a good 16 year old out here, you know. You know, they're just starting younger and they're just so much better. You know, now they're not even finishing high school. It's just a different world.

 Q. When you were 16, what was going through your mind?
 JULI INKSTER: 16 I didn't even know what the LPGA was, you know. (Laughter.) I just kind of fell into golf. I got a job working at the golf course and I just started playing. You know, I never watched golf.
