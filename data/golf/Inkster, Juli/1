Q. Juli, obviously I know a little disappointing but perhaps one of the best Solheim Cups most of us have ever witnessed. What do you say about the heart of your team being able to do the things they were able to do throughout the week?
JULI INKSTER: It's amazing. It's just great golf. We had Scottish weather, which we all expected. And today the sun just came out and shined.
And we saw a lot of great matches out there. But you know what, they just played a little better than us. But as you know that's the way it goes in golf.
Q. What are you going to take away from this and the spirit of your team?
JULI INKSTER: We had a great time. We had six rookies out there that played great. I think they all got at least a point or half a point. And I couldn't ask any more of these girls, the way they grinded during that weather yesterday.
And you know what, Suzann made a great putt. And you know, the Solheim Cup doesn't come down to that putt, but she made it today.
Q. Back in the States, they say you are the people's captain. This is your third time running the ship. Will we see you again?
JULI INKSTER: No, you won't. But I'll be out watching. I can't wait to get to Toledo and see if we can get that Cup back.
Q. What can you say about that finish?
JULI INKSTER: Amazing finish. Suzann played great, Marina played great. It was just a great match, and it came down to half a point. So, good on them.
Q. You had six rookies. Everyone on your team scored a point. What can you say about the entire unit?
JULI INKSTER: You know what, they played great golf. They just played a half a point better. But you know what, it's great for women's golf. And I'm really proud of my team. I'm really proud to be able to represent the U.S.A.
Q. Three straight times captain of the U.S.A. Solheim Cup team. How about a fourth?
JULI INKSTER: No, no, no. I'm 2-1, I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.
