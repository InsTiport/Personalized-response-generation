Q. How does Captain Juli Inkster sound?
JULI INKSTER: From the emotions this morning to the emotions now, my team played so damn good out there.  They just never gave up.  It was just amazing.
Gerina Piller's putt on 18, unbelievable.
Q. And what about Angela Stanford, here, bringing down Suzann Pettersen.  What was the cause of all the hullabaloo this morning?
JULI INKSTER: You know what, Angela deserved that.  She played pretty good this week and didn't get a point and I know everybody is on her because of her record.  She wanted it today, and she played awesome.
Q. It's been two Solheim Cups since you guys won.  You were down such a big deficit today.  I know you talk about heart and all the things that you've said to your team day in and day out until today.  Can you believe that this has happened?
JULI INKSTER: You know what, I was on them all week.  You've got to play with heart.  You've got to play with fire in your belly.  Never give up.  I saw my team out there today, it didn't look good early, they hung in there, a lot of 2-downs came to evens, and then plus 1.
Cristie Kerr was down early.
And I love my lineup.  I loved the way they stacked up today.  I just have so many people I have to thank.  It's a great feeling.
Q. Speaking about that lineup, Paula Creamer, some would have thought maybe a little bit of a controversial pick.  She was never a controversial pick for you, you put her out in the anchor position?
JULI INKSTER: She played great this week.  I've got a ton of confidence in Paula.  I knew if I needed a 4-footer to make, I knew she would make it.  I put her in last and it turned out great.
