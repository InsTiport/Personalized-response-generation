Q. Had a good day?
JULI INKSTER: Yeah.
Q. Having fun?
JULI INKSTER: Yeah.  Played well today.  Actually played pretty good -- I got to hug my Commish.
I actually played pretty well all week.  Friday had kind of a balky putter, but really like the way I'm hitting the ball.
Rolled the ball really well today.
Q. What did you do you on the eagle?
JULI INKSTER: Driver, 3-wood, about 15 feet, and made it.
Q. We've asked you this a million times, but what keeps you going?
JULI INKSTER: You know what?  I wish I could give you an exact answer.  I like the challenge of getting better and playing.
I don't know if that makes sense, but I really enjoy playing golf.  I really enjoy practicing and I really enjoy working on my game, especially when you have days like this where things come together and it works out.
Just got to learn how to put the four rounds together again.  I really like the direction I'm going.  I've been working with a guy named Jeff Brehaut; he's a friend of mine and he's been good for me.
Q. Wanted to ask you about the nature of the game today.  You played through some eras, golden ages.  Where do you think we're at right now?
JULI INKSTER: We're at some really good golf and some real talent.  When I was kind of in my prime I was probably top 15, 20 distance, and these girls hit it 40 past me.  They just bomb the ball.  They hit it straight.  They're just really good players.
Q. Is it as deep and talented as it...
JULI INKSTER: Yeah, it's deep, it's deep and it's talented.  In order to win out here, you've got to play four really good rounds, four low rounds.
