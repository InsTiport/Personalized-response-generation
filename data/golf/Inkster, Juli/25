JULI INKSTER: Got a little sloppy at the end, but I think they're looking forward to coming out here, best ball, maybe getting that one point back.   
 Q.  (Question about the lineup)?  
JULI INKSTER: I want to get Wie and Yin out here, and Danielle and Michelle want to play together.  And Lexi and Angel have been -- Lizette and Angel have been practicing a lot together, and they're a good mix because Lizette is straight down the middle and Angel can bomb it.  So we'll see how that works out.  And then Lincicome and Lang, they haven't played, want to get them out.
