Q.  Juli, there was a lot of action out there today.  What is the difference from this morning's matches from yesterday's matches?

There was a little bit of a meltdown by the Americans.  Were you in charge of the team room last night?

JULI INKSTER:  I was.  We played good golf yesterday.  They made a lot of good putts yesterday on us.

I didn't get to play with Paula yesterday morning, so the coach gave me that job to come out here and get her all fired up.  We really complement each other really well.

We were struggling on who was going to hit the odds and who was going to hit the evens.
Q.  Well, your strategy was perfect.  Paula, you really hit the key shot in the match on 16.  What was going through your mind?

PAULA CREAMER:  Juli said on one hole, I think it was 12, that my irons weren't being struck as well.  I was guiding it.  She said, "Let it go.  Let it go."

I hit some really good shots on the stretch, and we needed that.  Good finishing for us.
Q.  Congratulations.  Good luck this afternoon.

JULI INKSTER:  All right.  USA!
