 Q. Just talk about the day, where you are and how it went?JULI INKSTER: Yeah, I didn't play as good, I didn't putt as well, I just didn't hit it as good.  I missed a couple short putts. So overall, disappointing, but I'm here for the weekend and we'll see what happens.
Q. How do you approach it?  There's competition, a little bit of nostalgia going on here, what's the balance?JULI INKSTER: I'm just trying to play golf.  It's such a hard golf course.  It's five and a half hours for us to play.  I'm just trying to survive.  Tomorrow I hope to get a little later tee time and come out fresh and come out and play.
Q. What raised up and got you today?JULI INKSTER: Well, I didn't hit the ball as well as I hit it yesterday.  So I was in the native a little bit and I missed a couple short putts and there you have it.  It doesn't take much.
Q. Heat, humidity, those sort of things, have they impacted you at all?JULI INKSTER: No, not really.  It's just a long day.  I felt pretty good out there, just mentally it's just a grind.  I think it got away from me a little bit.
Q. Strategy for the rest of the week?JULI INKSTER: Go out there and try to play even par or 1-under each day and see what happens.
