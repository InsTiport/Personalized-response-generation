 Q.  It was your 18-year-old captain's pick who ultimately gets that winning point for you.  What does that say?  
JULI INKSTER: Well, you know, I'm just proud of my team.  The Europeans fought hard today.  They made it really close.  I really haven't been nervous all week.  But today I was a little bit nervous.  So it's just an honor to captain this team and I'm really proud of the girls.   
 Q.  You gave them a lunch pale two years ago in Germany.  You gave them a hard hat and told them to go to work this week.  How did they do?  
JULI INKSTER: You know what, they just bonded.  They believed in each other.  They played for the person behind them and in front of them.  And they played some amazing golf.   
 Q.  You're looking around here at your daughters and your husband, Brian.  You mentioned on Thursday in the opening ceremony family.  You got a little emotional.  What does it mean to do it in front of them and all the fans?  
JULI INKSTER: Well, they're a big part of my success.  And I couldn't be where I am this afternoon without them.  It's not only my family, but I have a lot of great friends here, and I'd call ourselves a team too.  So we call ourselves the core group and they're all out here this week.   
 Q.  You join Judy Rankin as the only woman to captain back-to-back successful Solheim Cup teams?  
JULI INKSTER: Anytime I can be in the company of Judy Rankin I'm feeling honored.
