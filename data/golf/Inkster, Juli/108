  Q.  What was different today?   
 JULI INKSTER:  You know what, I played just as good, I just didn't lose my momentum out there.  Yesterday I had a four-putt and two three-putts.  Today I eliminated those and kept it going.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 JULI INKSTER:  It's packed.  You've just got to keep making birdies and see how you do on the weekend.  Keep playing the way I'm playing, I think I'll be okay.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 JULI INKSTER:  Yeah, it's still breezy, breezy enough to keep your attention.  It's swirling, especially an those par 3s, trying to pick the right club, you know.  So it's still up there, but it wasn't as bad as yesterday.
