  Q. Good, solid start for you?  
 JULI INKSTER: Yeah, I didn't do anything bad. I kept it pretty much in the fairway. Hit a lot a lot of greens today. Had a lot of putts at it. Left some out there. But you know what, I played pretty consistent.   
  
  Q. It's hot today; how did that affect you at all?  
 JULI INKSTER: Well, nothing you can do. Just drink lots of water and try to eat a little bit as you go along, but it is hot. Yeah, it's hot.   
 Got to keep my irons a little crisper, my driver a little crisper. I felt like I rolled the ball good today. I didn't make a lot but I thought I kept it rolling, so that was encouraging.
