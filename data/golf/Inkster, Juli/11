 Q.  I know it didn't finish the way you wanted and didn't get as low as you wanted --  
JULI INKSTER: 10 really killed me.  I could have got there in two and ended up making bogey.  But you know, I drove the ball great.  Just didn't putt well.  So I didn't make any putts, and you've got to make some putts out here.  First day just killed me.   
 Q.  Competitively, you're not playing that much, so your expectations are high still, but --  
JULI INKSTER: Yeah, I mean, tee to green I played great, but I just didn't make the putts, and you have to -- out here, you have to make the putts.
