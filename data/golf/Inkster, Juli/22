Q. Just how proud are you of your team's performance here this week in Iowa?
JULI INKSTER: They were great.  I'm glad we had a lead because Europe came out firing.  And I knew they would.  But we got the beat.
Q. How special does it feel to go back-to-back?
JULI INKSTER: It's pretty special.  I've got a special group of gals.  We had Alison Lee, and I can't remember last year.  We added a couple new ones this year, and they just filled right on in.
Q. Lizette Salas, with that winning point for Team USA, is she kind of the epitome of the spirit and the passion that your squad has shown this week?
JULI INKSTER: You never know whether she's around or not, but every time you look at her, you just want to -- just leave her alone because she know what she needs to do.  She's not the longest hitter, but she's a great putter.  And you can't teach heart, and she's got a ton of heart.
Q. What was the difference this week for your side, Juli?  Why were you so dominant for the three days?
JULI INKSTER: They just came in in good form.  They came in ready to play.  They knew what this golf course demanded.  We had great preparation.  We played loose.  And we played free.  We played for each other.
Q. You talked about the fun elements as well.  How much did that feed all the way through this?  How much did that prove to be a decisive factor for them to go out and enjoy themselves and turn it on when they absolutely needed to?
JULI INKSTER: I'm sure Europe had a good time, too.  But we tried not to make anything too regimented, just let them do their thing.  We had some great team-room dinners and had a lot of banter and a lot of ping-pong.  But it's amazing.  I just can't believe we won.
