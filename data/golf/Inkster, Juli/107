  Q.  Juli, how did it feel to come out here and make that charge today like you did in front of a home crowd, family, friends?   
 JULI INKSTER:  It felt good.  I am disappointed in my finish.  I played good.  I played good.  It was fun.   
  
  Q.  Is breaking best record to become, say, the oldest woman to make a win here, is that something you focus on?   
 JULI INKSTER:  No, no.  (Laughter) I am just trying to focus on winning.   
 I mean, a lot of little things.  A little chip here, a little putt there.  It is keeping me from winning, and I just got to work on that so I am a little sharper.   
  
  Q.  You've mentioned before you have been vocal about what type of player you think Lorena is and having an admiration for her.  What was it like being paired with her and playing with her and watching her in action?   
 JULI INKSTER:  She was fun.  We get along really well and, you know, you're just chitchatting and playing some golf.  We talked all the time.  So it was fun.   
 It is very relaxing playing with her.  You know, you try to do your thing and she tries to do her thing and see what happens.
