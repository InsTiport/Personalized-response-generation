  Q. Tell me a little bit about how the course was playing and how you were able to -- maybe didn't have the round you did yesterday but still score well.
 RILEY SMYTH:   Yeah, I thought the course was playing a little tougher today.  It dried out great from all the rain, but I just wasn't making the putts.  I think they just weren't breaking as I thought they were going to, but I just kept it going out there, kept my attitude positive and just looking ahead to the next shot.
 Q. First Women's Amateur, you're going to advance to match play, what does that mean to you and how does that look from here?
 RILEY SMYTH:   Yeah, I mean, this was the experience that I wanted coming here.  I mean, my goal was to make match play, and luckily I made it comfortably.  Now there's still a lot of golf left this week, and the mental side definitely shifts because we are going into match play.  I mean, there's just a lot of golf left out there, and it's anybody's game now.
 Q. What's your experience with match play been like?  Have you played in many tournaments like that?
 RILEY SMYTH:   Yeah, I've played in a handful of match play events.  Last summer I actually finished runner-up at the Carolinas Match Play, which definitely gave me a great experience there just getting that match play under my belt and just knowing what it's like to make a run at it.
 Q. What's been your favorite part of the week so far?
 RILEY SMYTH:   Honestly, the course is phenomenal.  It just really sets up to my eye, and it's a great track to be out there.
