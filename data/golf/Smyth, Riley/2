  Q. 4-under 68.  Talk me through maybe some of the birdies you had on the day.
 RILEY SMYTH:   So I started out with a birdie on No. 4, which really got my day going.  I made a 15-footer, which just built up a lot of confidence in my putting and most of my birdies came from some pretty good putts.  I actually let a few slip out there on some short ones, but I mean, I was hitting the wall great and just really sinking some putts.
 Q. Playing in your first U.S. Women's Am, how did it feel, your first round out there and with it being the year that it is?
 RILEY SMYTH:   Yeah, so it was definitely nerve-wracking on the beginning.  I mean, I was nervous just as anybody else would be.  But I think a little bit playing in the situation that we are definitely helped because not having like really much going on around really calmed down my nerves.
 I just really was trying to let the experience just really take over my mind and just let that be only thought.
