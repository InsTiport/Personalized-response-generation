 Q.   So your putt on 18, it was a significant putt.   Did you feel a lot of pressure?   Did you know the significance of sinking it or missing it?  
SAKURA YOKOMINE:   It was so much pressure the whole 18 holes.   And then it was only five meters, but I felt like I need to make it for that point.   So it was just too much pressure and I was putting too much thought on it that's why it's kind of sliced out a little bit.   
I just feel so much, putting too much thoughts on it.  
   
 Q.   How has this tournament been, finally being able to play with teammates?  
SAKURA YOKOMINE:   The Japanese players are not used to playing in the team play, and so I was fortunate.   I was honored to be on the team representing Japan.   
The whole four days are so tough.   Today is the toughest day because the players are so good and play so well.   
But I'm happy that I am one of the four people on the team.   I just feel today that I'm lucky if I win today.
