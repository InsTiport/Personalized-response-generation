 Q. It was disappointing to finish with a bogey, but it's a good solid round and you're right in there.  You are certainly going into the top 10, do you feel good about your round and your position?SAKURA YOKOMINE: That's disappointing because it was sort of an easy mistake.  But overall I made an eagle and finished 1-over today.  It was a good round and I feel confident.
Q. You like hole No. 5, it's been good to you.SAKURA YOKOMINE: It turned out that way, yeah.
Q. Talk about the eagle.SAKURA YOKOMINE: I hit driver off the tee.  From the fairway I hit No. 4 hybrid and made a four meter for eagle.
Q. How do you feel in terms of your nerves going into tomorrow, knowing that you have a chance to contend for the championship, and will be in later groups on Sunday afternoon at a U.S. Open?SAKURA YOKOMINE: I feel that I'm still a little bit far away from chasing the title, but I will be happy if I finish amongst the top 10.
Q. In terms of the approach to tomorrow, is it just going out and doing more of the same and playing steady golf or do you try to take a few risks out there and make up the differential between the leader?SAKURA YOKOMINE: I'm going to do the same.  I'm going to play steady golf.
Q. It's working for you.  Very good.  Thank you.SAKURA YOKOMINE: Thank you very much.
