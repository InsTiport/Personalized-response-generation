   MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us now Sakura Yokomine. She had a round of 35, 36, 71, even par. Two birdies; is that correct?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: Yes.  
 MODERATOR: I think I have you for two birdies, one on No. 4.   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: No. 4?   
 MODERATOR: Birdie on No. 4, par-5.   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: Yes.  
 MODERATOR: How long was your putt, your birdie putt on No. 4?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) About three meter.   
 MODERATOR: And then you had your only other birdie on No. 14; how long was your putt there?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) 15 meter.  
 MODERATOR: 15 meters, so 45 feet. Wow, long putt. So you played a very consistent round, it looks like. Two birdies, two bogeys. How did you feel about the way you played today?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Well, what I did was each hole I did my best, tried to make it.   
 And then for the tee shot, I tried put the fairway. The green was pretty good. It stopped. So I thought that was a key, so I tried to concentrate on the green.   
 And then last hole was, last back nine, shot was pretty good. So I'm very happy about it.  
 MODERATOR: So the greens were holding? The greens would stop, and so you were trying to hit your irons all the way to the hole because they would stop; is that correct?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Yeah, even the greens stop, but I tried to get from pin to green about ten yard before. Ten yard before I tried to make it.  
 MODERATOR: Land the ball about ten yards short of the hole?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Yeah.  
 MODERATOR: Questions?   
  
  Q. Could you tell us where you left off in the rain, and what you did to prepare for the difference in the golf course after the rain hit for today?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Yeah, I feel like the distance was very long, but like I said, green was pretty much good stop.   
 So I tried to put on green, and I feel pretty relieved green. So I played comfortably today.  
 MODERATOR: What hole did you start on this morning?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) 13.  
 MODERATOR: And you played the back nine first, so you played 13 through 18 and then 1 through 9?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Yes.  
 MODERATOR: Questions?   
  
  Q. You obviously now have a fairly long wait until you resume playing. What will you be doing during that time to prepare yourself for a golf course that probably is going to get a little firmer and faster?  
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.)  
 INTERPRETER: Your question was how she prepare?   
  
  Q. Yes. Since you have a long wait now until you go back out for the third round, and the golf course will probably play a little bit differently than it did this morning.   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Yes, the sun out, so green is going to dry. It's different what I play and later on. So each hole I want to play my best.  
  
  Q. You played in the LPGA Championship, and then the next time you were out was here. What did you do between the two tournaments? Where were you, and did you think about coming to Oakmont a little earlier to get more practice rounds in?  
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) I haven't practiced.  
 MODERATOR: Took time off?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) I haven't been here.   
 INTERPRETER: Oh, between.   
 MODERATOR: Between the tournaments.   
 INTERPRETER: Thank you.   
  
  Q. Where were you and what you were doing?  
 INTERPRETER: Between?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Just relaxed.   
 MODERATOR: Okay. Where were you?   
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Chicago.
