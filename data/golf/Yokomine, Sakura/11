   THE MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome Yokomine Sakura, who came in with a round of 71 today. Yokomine, that's a wonderful wound for you. You had three birdies on the front nine; four birdies in total, and a double bogey on No. 12. 
 On your birdies, let's first talk about that. No. 2, how long was your birdie putt?
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Eight meters.
 THE MODERATOR: So 24 feet, about. No. 5? 
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) About three meters.
 THE MODERATOR: Three meters? Okay, so about nine feet. No. 9? 
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) About one meter. 
 THE MODERATOR: So about three feet, more or less. Then No. 18? 
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) 18, about same, one meter. 
 THE MODERATOR: One meter, so another three feet. If you will tell us about the double bogey on No. 12, and then we'll await the translation. 
 THE TRANSLATOR: After finish 12 hole how she felt about it? 
 THE MODERATOR: Describe how you made the double bogey first. How did you make double bogey? 
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) Second one, second shot I went to bunker. And then third one just only, you know, 6 got it out. 
 Then there was an 80 yards left, and then I did about 25 meter par putt on the green, and then I approached to two meter but she missed it. 
 THE MODERATOR: So she was in the fairway bunker, short of the green, on the green, and from about 75 feet three-putted? 
 THE INTERPRETER: That's right. 
 THE MODERATOR: All right. Tell us please how you like the golf course. Did it seem very, very hard to you? 
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) When I was doing the practice run, i thought maybe I can stay maybe three over, but today was even. I think I did very, very good job. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions? What will you try to do tomorrow after being even par today? You play in the afternoon tomorrow. What will you try to do when you play the course for the second round.
 SAKURA YOKOMINE: (Through translation.) So I have to make sure do the fairways on the tee shot, and after that put on the green. Then I would love to get the par, but I don't know it's going to go well or not. 
 I think this is a very important putting, so I am going to try her best to have the good putting this time.
