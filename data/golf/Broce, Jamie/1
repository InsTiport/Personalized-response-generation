Q.   Thoughts on your performance? 
JAMIE BROCE:   It was pretty good.   I think I drove the ball as good as you could possibly drive it today.   Had excellent chances.   Hit a couple of fat irons from just the wet lies in the fairways a couple times and didn't get the ball from some of the light fringe.
It was tough chipping but I played really well.   I gave it every heart and gut I had out there, so ended up missing the cut by three.   It was a good effort. 

Q.   What were your feelings about the entire week and the experience?
JAMIE BROCE:   Oh, you can't compare it to anything I've ever been through before.   Golfâ€‘wise it was absolutely awesome and now I hope to try to get back again.

Q.   How special was it for your family to get the VIP experience?
JAMIE BROCE:   I think they had a lot of fun, being able to eat the food and come down by the range and see all the players.   We got tons of autographs from all the guys.   It was unreal.

Q.   How about a recruiting tool; is this something you'll be able to utilize going forward?
JAMIE BROCE:   I hope so, especially with our guys, I had a lot of my own players out here, and I'll be going over to the British Boys' Junior in Scotland next week, so hopefully I'll be making a few more connections and people will realize what we have in Toledo.
