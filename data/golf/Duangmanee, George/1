 Q.  Tough match.  You had to really gut it out.  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: Yeah.  I mean, we brought it to 18 and he played incredible.  It was just tough to play against him.   
 Q.  And he made a couple birdies early to take the lead, and then on the backside you birdied 10 to go ahead.  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Tell me how did you that on 10.  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: Well, I saw him miss the green on his approach shot and I know his chip was going to be pretty tough.  Just played to the middle of the green and (indiscernible) conceded, so just to get it done that way, too.   
 Q.  And then he tied it with a par on 2 and you took the lead again on 14 with a par.  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: Yes.  That par, that was -- I shouldn't have won that hole.  I hit my driver in the thick rough, just chunked it out, hit it up on the green, and made the putt.   
The hole, it looked like he was going to win the hole, so, I mean, he three-putted, which, I mean, that's how I won the hole.   
 Q.  How many yards did you have on your third shot?  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: I had like 50 yards left in the rough.   
 Q.  What did you hit?  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: I hit a 60-degree and I just tried to get one trickling up there and was able to make the putt afterwards.   
 Q.  How far do you think the putt was?  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: Like ten feet left to right downhill.  It was not one of my favorite putts to hit.   
 Q.  When something like that happens, doesn't that give you a little confidence?  Match play you're never out of a hole.  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: Yeah, I mean, that one changed the whole round.  I think we were tied going into that hole and I thought he was going to win that hole and I ended up I wining the hole.   
That's a real momentum changer.   
 Q.  Then obviously it was going to even here to 18.  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: Yeah.   
 Q.  How do you keep yourself mentally focused with everything that's happened to this point?  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: I just stick to my routine:  hit it in the fairway, get it on the green, and have a great putt at it.   
I mean, you have to make changes compared to what he does, so I notice he hit it long and I just played it to the middle of the green and try to take my chances with putting.   
 Q.  Pretty good lag putt.  How long do you think that was?  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: About 30 feet, but with all the pressure -- with all the pressure on that putt I left it couple feet short, but I was able to get it done on 18.   
 Q.  How exciting is this for you?  
GEORGE DUANGMANEE: Exciting.  This is my first U. S. Junior, so I'm excited to see where this one goes.
