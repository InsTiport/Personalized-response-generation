It's not too bad being three shots behind. I played a bit better but couldn't get the putts to drop. Maybe I'm saving them for the weekend. It was just a couple of putts difference between today and yesterday. I just missed a few, that was it.

The course was probably playing a bit easier today. I wished I could have picked up a few more shots but I don't have that choice now. I played my game well and it would have been nice to see a couple more putts drop. I just have to keep playing the same way and keep patient at the weekend.
