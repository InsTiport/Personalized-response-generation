   PADRAIG HARRIGTON: I was very confident going out. I kept playing aggressive shots tentatively whereas playing conservative shots aggressively would have been better. I was felling good and overplayed a few shots. It's disappointing as I was very happy going out there.  
 I missed a putt on the seventh for birdie and got on my eighth hole, the 17th and it is a tough hole and John came up short with a four iron first. I thought I had to hit my four iron and draw it in and got to think other times hit to the right and get down in two putts but that is golf and I was too aggressive.   
  
  Q. Is it a case of not getting any traction early on?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I felt like that out there. You could say I try too hard and that is a possibility, no doubt about it. I was in great stead going out there coming off the last two weeks. I was hitting the ball well and looking forward to it. I probably wasn't that patient. The first two holes were very simple birdie chances and I played them one over. It was a disappointing start and then maybe holes like 17 I would have played more conservatively if I was a couple under par
