  Q. First Playoffs event of the PGA TOUR; it's a tough course to learn this quick.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, it is a good golf course. It's tough, you want to hit it straight. It's a fine test out there.   
  
  Q. Tell me about your day on this golf course.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Myself, the middle of the round, I had some great birdie opportunities. Missed a number of short putts right in the middle, and two sixes from the edge of the green on two holes, instead of coming off those holes at a couple under par, I played them 3-over.   
  
  Q. Kenny Perry was saying that on a couple of holes, the rough was so thick, it was tough to even get hybrid out of it.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Oh, yeah, you don't want to miss the fairway and you're forced to take on a lot of shots out there. You've got to hit it well off the tee. I managed that okay. It was more, as I said, a couple of chip shots around the green.   
  
  Q. A couple more days to play golf.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, that's what I'm going to go and do. I'm going to go and do some practice, and you know, you get days like that and just hope that I don't get another one tomorrow or the next day or the next day.   
  
  Q. How did the mind and body feel today?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I felt okay. I thought I played nicely, but middle of the round, I missed a number of really good birdie chances and then took four twice and two sixes. Looking back at it, you have to say, you know, I didn't feel like I did much wrong, but some of that's that mental tiredness.   
 I know it's difficult out there and the rough is tough, but that was just bad play on my behalf.  
  
  Q. Do you like the way the course is set up?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: The course is really good, yeah. You have to get it off the tee and to get it off there, to give yourself any chances of making birdies, and it's firm and a good pace. Yeah, a good setup.   
  
  Q. You said earlier in the week -- did you feel more confidence in what you were looking for ahead in this week?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: More of the same old stuff. I suppose you're not going to change overnight, anyway, or change a lot. I played the same as I would normally. I worked my way through most of the round. As I said I made a few mistakes in the middle of the round and missed a couple of putts from four or five feet for birdie, but I look back at the two sixes, and gave away four shots, or certainly two on those holes.  
  
  Q. Do you feel more pressure this week after the last couple of months?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I feel the same as any time going out on the golf course, trying to do my thing and work hard. I obviously wouldn't be as good on a Thursday as I would on a Sunday, and first week back, it takes a bit of time to get back into the swing of things and I did make a few mistakes out there. I wouldn't want to make them the next three days and hopefully I don't make them the next three days.
