Q.  Is 2 over the par the worst you could have shot out there?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Looks like it.  Suppose I could have shot worse.  It was certainly    probably played a little bit better than that.
Q.  Off to a nice start.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, no, should have been 4 under after five, and you know, hit a few bad putts to take it away and wasn't really trusting my reads after that.  Hit plenty of bad putts to follow up.  There you go.  Goes like that some days.  Hopefully I can keep playing the same way the next three days and it will even itself out.
Q.  Did you feel sorry for Paul the way he was feeling today?  He looked absolutely desperately unwell.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, it was obviously a very tough day for him.  He was struggling to get around.  It's always tough on any playing partner, you want your playing partner to play well.  It certainly helps when two guys are holing putts and two guys are going well.  You tend to play a little bit better.  It was very tough on him today.  Nothing seemed to go right for him either.
Q.  Did it have detrimental effect on your play?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I wouldn't think it had detrimental effect.  But it is nice to see putts going in, and neither myself or Paul holed putts.

You know, that's all I tried to do on the last there, but that sums up your day, you hit the perfect putt, the perfect line, you try to pick it out, I start with a horseshoe and I finish with a horseshoe.  Some days it goes like that.  You know, another day, those two putts would have gone in and another three or four putts had gone in and no different, I'd be all smiles.  I have to accept the fact that some days it goes like that.

Disappointed that I hit one bad putt on the 17th hole where I did    you know, I hit a bad putt from four feet.  All day, I hit poor putts and that's all you can do.  When they are not dropping in is to try to keep hitting them at the hole and I did do that.  So that's as much as you can do on a day like this.  But some days, you hole them with your eyes closed.  Another day, you can't find the way in.
Q.  What is the damage, your situation?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  The damage is I played well today.  You know, to try and win any tournament, you probably want to play well twice, two days, and two average days.  This is one of the days I played well, and I haven't scored.  I could have played awful and shot a better score.
Q.  Graeme McDowell went out first and said the greens were absolutely perfect.  Was it the opposite for you then going out at the end?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  No, I never had one second today where a ball hit a spike mark or a heel, but I thought the greens held up great.  Graeme thought the greens were great because he dropped a few putts.  (Laughter) that's the way it goes.  You hole a few putts, you know, you think it's the easiest game in the world, and it breeds confidence into every part of your game.  Like I did well to keep playing well all day when they were not dropping.  I kept my focus really good.  I'm really happy with that.  I got in the right place all day and focus was great.  I didn't let the not holing the putts get to me.
