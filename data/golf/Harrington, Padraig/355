  Q. The last three rounds, how do you assess them?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Actually it was tough going, but the only difference in the rounds was I didn't really hole putts in the last two days, three rounds. But I suppose as expected.   
 I'd like to think that I could -- I wish I wasn't so predictable at times. I obviously hoped I could get into the FedExCup and perform, but that's not the case. In hindsight it was a step too far. But there you go.   
  
  Q. Do you think a week off will be long enough to recharge the batteries?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Oh, dear, yeah. Well, I hope. It's not as if I have a choice. Yeah, I hope so.   
  
  Q. Some of your colleagues have said it's wrong that a two-time major champion won't be in the TOUR Championship.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I don't believe so. I actually think it's probably right. I think the whole idea is this is a four-week event. It has a little reflection of the year, but it's really a four-week event, and it's the guys that do the best in those four weeks should be there. I think the system needs tweaking, but I don't think it needs tweaking to keep people in there. I think you need to have people missing out. I think that's what's missing at times. We need to have players get knocked out. That's what happens in a playoff.   
  
  Q. How would you tweak it?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Without going into it in depth, I certainly probably would reduce the points in the first two weeks for just making the cut, increase the points higher up, probably double the points in this week to make it as volatile this week as it was in the last couple of weeks and double the points again at the TOUR Championship.   
 I'd probably say the first two weeks should count on a scale of say one, the third week two and the last week three in terms of how players should move around. And as I said, maybe increase the points at the top and reduce it at the bottom. That would be -- something along those lines.   
  
  Q. What about the 144?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I think that's another issue. I don't think that would be a very popular decision to cut the field any more than they do. I probably would stick with that but keep the volatility. Somebody starting off who plays well should be able to win it from 144th or 1st, should have the opportunity to go and play golf.   
  
  Q. Will you take this week off? Will you practice? What is your plan?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Actually the game is fine, so my intention would actually be to rest this week. There's nothing in my game that I'm unhappy with. Just rest needs to be -- make the right decisions a bit more often. I struggled yesterday at times just making the right decisions, and that is a little bit of tiredness, really, that comes into that.   
  
  Q. Going home for a week?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, going home.
