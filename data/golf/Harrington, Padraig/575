Q. Is everything all right with Dave (McNeilly) (who ran from the 18th green without waiting for Harrington to putt out)?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Oh yes, he's fine, he's just had to rush for a flight, that's all. Everything is okay with him.



Q. We thought it might be something to do with the baby, how are things there?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well there is my last text (Mobile phone showed the message, 'You concentrate on your job and I'll do mine). Yes, she's in hospital at the moment. When I was talking to her earlier today before I went out that things were happening and she said, you know, it is possible. I texted her out on the course on the tenth and I didn't get a reply immediately I thought she must have gone in. Then I got that reply when I was on about the 13th.



Q. So it doesn't look like you are going to make it then?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well hopefully not, I hope she has the baby in the next ten minutes for her sake. Obviously I wish I was back for me but it certainly doesn't look like I'll be back at this stage. Hopefully I will just get the good news as soon as possible.



Q. How do you feel now?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well the last couple of days have been tough, I have got to say. I've wanted to go home. We were hoping it would go a couple of days more and that would make everything all right, but it looks like is not to be. But we can't have everything, as long as I have a healthy baby and a healthy wife at the end of it all, I'll be a very happy man. My flight is 5.00pm, I'll get back home about 7.00 in the morning. She has gone into hospital in Dublin. It is 5.00pm from here to JFK and then on to home.
