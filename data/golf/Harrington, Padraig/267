  Q. Padraig, nice play today. You were neck and neck with Lee Westwood all day. How was it out there?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah. It was good. Yeah, it seemed okay. I had three three-putts, which is a bummer. I shot a nice score, considering, and so pretty pleased with my position going forward.  
  
  Q. What's it going to take to win the tournament?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I don't know. Have to wait and see. If I knew that sort of stuff, I'd be a fortune teller. Keep doing our thing and see what happens.   
  
  Q. Going to work on anything different with the putting stroke?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No. The putts I three-putted were difficult. It wasn't a question of being silly. I hit a few -- I putted actually quite nicely. I'm not saying I putted badly or anything. I just had three three-putts, which was unfortunate.   
 It's nice to shoot a decent score when you do do that.  
  
  Q. Right.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: And a couple of them were on par-5s, so I still parred the holes.   
 Yeah. Don't have anything in particular to work on, no. The game was fine, and we'll have more of that for another three days.
