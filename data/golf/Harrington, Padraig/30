PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Definitely, I thought it was going to break right to left instead of left to right.  It kept going straight.  It looked like it was going in all right.  The story of my day.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's not hard at all.  No.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I played how I expected.  I played grand.  I made a few errors in getting to judging the wind, and then I felt, I guess I made two birdies in two days.  One of them came -- I only hit two bad shots today, and one of them resulted in a birdie.
I missed the green at 17 left, and it bounced down onto the green to ten feet.  Everywhere else drove it superbly, just got caught out a couple of times.
The second was a bad start obviously, and a double-bogey, then a bogey.  Two three three-putts in a row.  Again, you need to get -- the whole idea is you want to play in these certain conditions.  You get one ahead of the game early on and you feel okay.  You feel you have something in the bank.  And dropping three shots and then I missed a short putt on 14.  10 and 14 I missed two short putts.  I'm sure people missed short putts in these conditions.  I'd be happy if I played like that every day.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, the nicest part of the day was when we stopped.  It was lovely at that stage, very calm, no wind.  Yeah, and then it came up back up windy and west.  Realistically, really the golf ball is going nowhere at the end of the day.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Between now and Birkdale the last time I was here I probably got the average amount of breaks.  I'll take it as it went.  I'll try to have it all one week and none the next.
Yeah, I was surprised, you know, as I said, it was -- things didn't go right.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I hit 6-iron.  I hit a nice tee shot, 165 front.  I thought I could a three-quarter 6-iron, as long as I didn't hit it into the wind and land it around the front.  I overdrew the draw but I was shocked, I assumed it was in the bunker.
There was a lot of that today.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah.  There was a lot of that today.  Oh, 10, you'd be surprised.  There wouldn't be many.  The pressure worn off.  I did a lot of good things, yeah.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: (Speaking off microphone).
