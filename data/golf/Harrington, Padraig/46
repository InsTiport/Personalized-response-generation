Q. 67, going into the last day 17-under?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I'm happy with that.  I would have liked to, obviously when I got it through ten holes as I did, if I pushed on a couple, it would take a lot of people out of it, out of contention tomorrow.  Obviously there's plenty of guys now that feel they can shoot a low one in there, 8-, 9-, 10-under par as we've seen.  Got to play well tomorrow.  A lot of work to be done.
Q. It looks like we got in in the nick of time, raindrops are starting to fall.
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, it will be no fun now playing in the rain, I can tell you.  You've got to drive it well and it's tough to drive it when it's raining.  I'm happy we're in now.
Q. Was it very different out there from the first two days?  Obviously overnight there was a lot of rain?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: It was a little different, a little soft but not incredibly different.  But I've got to say, I think the course played very well.  We had placing and we didn't really need placing.  The greens are a tiny bit softer.
But I've got to say, a tiny bit longer the golf course played, but really didn't make a huge deal of difference.  The golf course held up well.
Q. The golf course itself, it looks like it's held up to the weather extremely well and also going into the final day, do you like going it in front or behind?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: You always want to have as many shots in hand as you can get.  I won't say that it's easy to lead from the front.  It's definitely easier to, let's say, less stressful if you're a bit behind and you get some momentum.  That's what I was saying, guys at 12, 13, 14 might be a bit relaxed going out there and to make a few birdies early on, because they are relaxed, they have got momentum going into the back nine.  Whereas, you know, when you're leading a tournament, you've always got one eye on not making a mistake, which that's the way it is.  You could be through nine holes and level par and not quite feeling on top of your game.  You could be still leading the tournament and feeling a little bit, you know, not 100 percent, I've missed a putt, or I'm a little tentative here.
As I said, these guys, 12-, 13-under, could be having a great day, and there's nothing like momentum.  So that's what I was saying, it would be nice if I was two or three shots further forward, because it really does take out those guys who could essentially have a big day.  I won't say get lucky, but have a big day tomorrow.
