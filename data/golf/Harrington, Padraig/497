PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Well, it's actually not a tough way to lose, it's a good way to lose if you're going to lose.  I wouldn't see it like that at all.  I was mentally making    giving myself    I was expecting Davis to get up and down on the last and I'd have to hole mine out to go to 19.  I was prepared for that, but maybe not prepared for him holing out.
Q.  What a comeback you made, though.  You were down 3 and you hung in there.  You've got to feel good about that.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, I played better today, but what's been going wrong with my game the last couple of days is a test of my short game.  When I struggled early on, I didn't get it up and down.  Ultimately it's hard    Davis is playing very well and it's hard to give him three holes.  Out there I gave him three holes.  I'm sure he gave me a few back, but I certainly can't afford to give him up three.  Pity about that.
Q.  You've lost more holes than you've won, and here you are in the quarter finals.  I don't know how that happened, but that's the stat.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  How is that?
Q.  I don't know.  Must be another TV error.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I could have    no, I was 4 & 2 the first day, so that means I'm up 4.  And I was down at most 2 today and level the other two, so it's impossible.
Q.  Then that was a bad stat.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  That's impossible.

You know, I suppose, as I said, I didn't finish out well myself today.  I played a bit better than I did the last two matches, but just the short game was rough, basically.  You can't get away with that all the time.  It was good the last couple of days but not good today.
