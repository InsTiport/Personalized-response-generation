 Q. Solid day? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah. I had plenty of chances. The bogey on 15 was horrible but it was nice to chip-and-putt the last. I felt like I had gotten it back on 18 when I had given a shot away on 15. Always nice to finish that way.

 Q. How about the feeling over 54 holes, pretty consistent all around?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I seem to have gotten 18 holes further than most weeks. 

 Q. Getting closer. Good to have that buzz going into Sunday?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

 Q. Missed it, have you?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Of course I've missed it. I had it plenty of times last year. I was in contention a dozen times last year, and the same sort of contention as I am tomorrow, a little bit off the lead and I need a big day. It's not like at any stage last year, except for the one, I was out in front. I've been in the last couple of groups through last year but just didn't play well and ended up going backwards. 
 A lot of events over here last year, I was in the Top-10 going into the last round, three, four, back. It's doable but it means a big day tomorrow and I had that a lot last year and I don't want to press too hard or too quickly. Have to wait and see how we get on and keep playing the same way. 

 Q. How are the changes?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm very happy with those.
