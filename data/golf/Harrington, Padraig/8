 Q.  Tell us about the day and the way it unfolded for you.  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Had a nice start.  I didn't play well after 5.  So the course is set up nicely.  It was very playable.  Yeah, just wasn't -- a couple of putts could have dropped in the middle of the round.  There were a significant number of putts that didn't go in.  And clearly I lose momentum when it gets tougher after that.   
So it was a combination of a few weak shots and a few poor putts that didn't drop.   
 Q.  This is not an ordinary occasion with Royal Portrush after 68 years.  What does it feel like as an Open course, the atmosphere from early morning?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: The course is great.  Atmosphere is great.  It's unbelievable to have an Open, but we've been saying that all week.  And I'm sure we'll say that next week.   
 Q.  If you have an opportunity to get through to the weekend, do you have something in your game to be competitive in the next few days?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes and no.  I thought I would have been better today, so it doesn't fill me with much confidence.  I know I'm on the right track.  Just today was not a good day.   
 Q.  What is it do you think at the moment?  There's great golf in you and it hasn't been there lately.  Is it something you're working on, a switch that needs to flip?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No, it's not a switch.  It's going to take some time.  It's there, physically, but mentally needs a bit of work.
