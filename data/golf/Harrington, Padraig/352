   PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Probably missed a couple of putts that we could have closed the match out with. They came back strong, and obviously it was tight over the last three holes. I quite fancied Phil chipping in from there. That's the sort of stuff he does. When I had a chance to hole out, I think that's an 8-footer, ten foot tore win the match. That's as good as we could have asked for. Looked like it was going in a little bit firmer than I thought it was and just kept going on the high side. I think, you know, in the end of the day, 18 holes, we're happy we had that putt on the last and venture on with that.   
  
  Q. You must be a little disappointed.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I think we're disappointed. We had a chance at the last hole. We had a putt to win from ten feet and I thought I had holed it. Besides that, we can't be disappointed. We did as well as we could. We didn't leave too many shots out there. You know, we fought really hard and took a lot of opportunities. We turned over a number of holes out there, so we can't complain about the halve, even though it would have been very sweet to get the win there.   
  
  Q. It was proper, proper match play, wasn't it. ?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It was good fun out there. Two very difficult players we played against and it was good fun.   
  
  Q. What about the atmosphere, what was it like?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: There are more American fans here, but it's good.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: We don't feel like it was a halve point lost. We fought hard and turned over a number of holes early on. We had a great chance at the end of the round.   
 We missed some short putts on 8 and 9, 13, and after that, it was a bit of a struggle. You know, we did well and we holed a putt and we made good pars on 16 and 17, and you know, we did well to halve the putt to win the match on 18.   
 I suppose, if you had asked me on the first tee, I would have taken a 10-footer to win and looked like I had holed it. Obviously I hit it a fraction harder than I expected it and it just stayed up on that high side, and that is disappointing.   
 Certainly, on the first tee you would take a 10-footer on the last to win the match and take your chances.   
  
  Q. Brilliant atmosphere, as well?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, it was classic match play because it wasn't classic golf. I certainly struggled a bit with my swing, and you know, thankfully myself and Robert, we knew what to expect of each other. We knew that we were not going to play, you know, orthodox golf and we were going to get it up-and-down.   
 We did that. We did ever so well. I don't think we ever let up on any single shot out there. You know, that's all you can ask yourself.  
  
  Q. Any problems with your shoulder or neck?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's fine. It was just a little thin through six or seven holes. I was worried about it getting worse rather than anything else and it seems to be fine. It's warmed up nicely with the heat.   
  
  Q. Pretty disappointing with six to play, losing three holes, that's a bit of a blow, isn't it?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, in the overall context of the match, no. If I look at the match, yes, we were 3-up. But you know, we were doing very well to be 3-up. You've got to say, the last three holes, we really did well to halve all of them, to be honest. They were in the driving seat in all three holes.   
 So we can't complain about the halve at the end of the day. We've got to see that as being positive. We did fight over those last three holes to keep it.   
 It was very good, good, noisy, respectable. Those couple of holes we lost, the atmosphere went up and the tension went up and it was very exciting to finish it off that way.   
  
  Q. Generally happy with the day?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, you can see yourself, it was very erratic. I did some really good things and I hit some poor enough tee shots and I hope I drive a bit better this afternoon.
