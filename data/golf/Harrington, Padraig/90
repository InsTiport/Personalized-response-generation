Q.   Good day? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   It was nice.   I scored nicely today, better than probably‑‑ certainly the first consecutive rounds of the year, where I scored better than I've certainly played, which is nice. 
I have been scoring poorly, on top of how I've been playing.   4‑under par, okay, not a bad position.   I think it's the first tournament of the year that I've come down to the last hole not on the cut line.   Actually second tournament of the year, because one I missed a putt, and every other tournament I've been on the cut line, and it's nice to be on the leaderboard rather than at the other end of it. 
6‑under ‑‑ it was important to make that par at the last, 4‑under.   Maybe there might be an 8‑under lead at the end of the day, 4‑under is not too far away.   You don't want to be slipping back to 2, let's say.   You would have a lot of work to do. 
But from 4 to, if 8‑under is leading, it's not that far way. 

Q.   Can you go through that last par at the last? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I hit a 5‑wood off the tee.   Unfortunately I‑‑ you know, I hit a good hard draw and I thought it was perfect and it kept drawing into the wind.   Basically the wind went into me rather than off to the left.   It bounced down.   I thought it stayed up but it was down and I had to drop it back 25 yards, I would say, and I had 190 to the pin and I hit 184, just‑‑ nice 6‑iron in there, straight down the pin. 
I was a little disappointed to be 15, 18 feet short.   The good news for me was that Brian hit it in right behind me and gave me a perfect read on the putt.   These are the good breaks you get sometimes, that's the difference in having a good score or a bad score. 

Q.   You're not of that removed from being one of the top players in the world. 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, you look‑‑ my game hasn't been as good as I happened this year.   I'm addressing it, and I feel I'm addressing it the right way.   I see some positive signs.   A lot has to do with my putting.   It hasn't been so strong and that feeds back into the game. 
I'm seeing some good stuff.   You know, it doesn't happen‑‑ it's not an overnight thing.   These things don't switch straightaway.   It's a gradual thing, and I'm seeing the signs of it turning around nicely, and I don't want to get too bullish.   I've got to stay patient and let it happen but certainly I'm happy that things are turning around and the good news for me is I know I can do it when I'm there, so it's just a question of allowing it to happen. 

Q.   Retief is playing well?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I see that.

Q.   Mike Weir, Duvall had a good round yesterday.   Kind of a throw‑back week, huh? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm not as old as them!   I'm not!   Yeah, you know, I don't know, maybe certainly this course is an interesting course, it's not a straightforward course so maybe a bit of experience doesn't do you any harm out here.
