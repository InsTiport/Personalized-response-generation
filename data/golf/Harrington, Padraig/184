   PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, that was nice. Could have been a bit better. 

 Q. How is this new swing we've been reading all about? Is it slowly kicking in? Comfortable with it? Or is it still a work-in-progress? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, it's still a work-in-progress. I was very good in practise. But I wasn't quite as relaxed about it in play, that would best sum it up. You know what, I think playing well in practise didn't help things, either. Because you kind of think, you hit it to 20 feet -- I'm happy with where it's at. 
 Yeah, just it's not quite automatic. That's the word I was looking for.

 Q. You've had a lot of time this week with Pete, haven't you?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I've had time. Still working on things. It's not like I'm not working on things, but yeah, there was a lot of good stuff. I hit a lot of good shots. An awful lot of 9-irons and wedges and things like that to 30 feet. That's a sign that you're thinking too much. 

 Q. A lot of golf to play this year, haven't you, before the Christmas break?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I'm happy. Like definitely the bit I would consider my weakest bit is very good at the moment. I would be -- I need to just keep playing like this and get used to it.

 Q. You're going to Carnoustie tomorrow which is always good memories?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes, it has great memories, but tough golf course. 

 Q. Tough out there this afternoon? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I should have made more, end of the day. I did hole several short ones, 3- or 4-footers, but as I say, I didn't hit enough of my short irons close and I was well in range on the last and birdieing -- my birdies came really -- two putts and an eagle putt on 6. What else did I birdie? Well, on the edge of the green on 12. Holed about a 12-footer on 11. 
 You know, look, it's exactly -- it's not quite automatic but I'm very happy with what I'm seeing.

 Q. What's the big goal in the rundown for the year? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Win, win, win. 

 Q. You desperate for that, or getting impatient?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I think so at times, yeah. I would definitely say that. Yeah, it's always the case though, when -- it's the chicken and the egg. When you're relaxed you play better and when you haven't, you try harder. I can see myself out there, I wasn't anywhere near as relaxed as I should be. I was anxious at times, and there's no reason to be. 
 Game is under good control. It wasn't -- you know, but that's a sign, yeah, you're pushing it a little too hard. 

 Q. So start of The Ryder Cup, that's not a priority; win and things like, that good results will take care of that, won't they?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I'm thinking of, you know, winning, getting backup the World Rankings, Ryder Cup, Race to Dubai. There's a lot of different goals. But I do feel good about my game, yeah. 

 Q. You have a lot of golf left?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, five tournaments or so.

 Q. What's after this week? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Probably play Portugal. Then China, Race to Dubai. There's a few left to win. Hopefully I'll get myself into HSBC, too.
