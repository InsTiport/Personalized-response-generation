 Q. Padraig, talk about your round today and finishing with a bogey on 18. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You said it all. It was a tough day. I wasn't very coordinated today. Struggled a bit. You know what, I fought hard on the back nine, created a lot of chances, didn't hole the putts and that was a bit disappointing. But I was never a bit too sure of myself tomorrow. So hopefully a better day tomorrow. 

 Q. Do you feel like being at 7-under Jim is at 11, how do you feel about tomorrow? Do you feel like you're too far away from him?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, it's obviously only one person, so that's not so bad. I don't want to give Jim a four-shot lead over a four-round tournament, let alone one round. There's enough guys behind that somebody is going to shoot a good score and put some pressure on him. Hopefully it's me. 

 Q. You guys are going to go out early, will conditions change anything at all for you? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It doesn't bother me, no. It will be the same for everybody. 
 Yeah, I'm not too fussed about going out early. It's fine. Just go and do our best.
