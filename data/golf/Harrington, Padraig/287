   PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, obviously I come up shy, a bit disappointed but on the last definitely had a chance. Such is life, I suppose. I made some mistakes around the turn. Probably was a little bit aggressive off the tee on 10 and then maybe -- didn't hit a good tee shot on 12. Obviously got very unlucky. It looked like it was just in the rough. But that's the way it goes.   
 Obviously it was nice to make a few birdies coming home and have a putt on the last that meant something.   
  
  Q. We talked about it a couple of times this week, but the support that you were getting from the gallery out there, you were beaming all day with the way that the gallery was giving you the love that they were. It was really amazing.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, obviously Boston, there were a lot of Irish people here, and they came out and supported me today. They would have liked to see me deliver. Unfortunately I didn't.
