Q.
Can you talk about coming in 2nd the past couple of years here?  Does it help you as you progress playing this year?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Definitely not.  You finish 2nd a couple of times, obviously there's people putting the burden of expectation on you.  You go out there thinking that you should be doing this, you should be doing that, and it's a lot harder when there's expectations.  Where I've fared well on the golf course, I've enjoyed the golf course, it does put a little bit of burden on you when you think that you should perform well on it.
Q.  Was it important for you to come out this morning when it was still a little wet to put up a nice number?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I think the conditions were perfect.  I've never seen this golf course play as easy.  You know, no wind, a lot of pins in hollows, so if you're hitting fairways you've got great chances at making birdies.

Obviously there was a bit of mud on the ball and things like that, but overall this was a good day for scoring.
