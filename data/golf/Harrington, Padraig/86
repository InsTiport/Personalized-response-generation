 Q.   You said all you needed was a little momentum was this year of yours to burst back to life.   Was today momentum?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     Headed in the right direction.   Last couple of weeks I've had some good scores and I haven't been able to sustain it.   Obviously that would be the goal for the weekend is to play like I did the first two days, and if I do that, yeah, then we'll start talking about momentum.   But you do need to finish off tournaments, and I badly need a win and certainly that would be the momentum I'm talking about.  
   
 Q.   What's it like to play in front of thousands of people who are willing every ball into the hole?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   You have to be very careful.   There's no doubt, you have to take it in the right way.   For years, I found it put me under a lot of pressure.   Now, I kind of see there's encouragement without the expectation.   
Years ago it was expectations and you felt like you were letting people down.   And true enough, you're emotionally attached to your own event, The Irish Open here.   And anything happens, you take it certainly.   I hit an average shot to a green and I kind of want to tell everyone that's an average shot, it wasn't a great shot, and they are clapping, that sort of thing.   
Take the momentum for sure, take the good stuff, but try not to get too personally involved.   
   
 Q.   Good feeling into the weekend?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I've been here a few times and haven't done so well on the weekend.   I'm changing up stuff and hoping it will still work well for the weekend.   I'm looking forward to the opportunity, and that's what we really look for in the game of golf, plenty of opportunities, and given enough opportunities, you figure it out sometimes.   
For sure, I didn't have myself much trouble over two days.   Wasn't out of position that much.   A lot of fairways, a lot of greens, didn't seem to, I didn't hit that close; I could have hit a few of my wedge shots closer, but I had a lot of 15‑, 20‑footers, 30‑footers and I kept running the ball at the hole.   That was nice and positive.   All my putts today halfway there had a chance of going in.   I got a big bonus on 17 but the reality is I ran a lot of putts at the hole, so at some stage, something is going to fall.  
There's no doubt that you've got to use that momentum, but it's a double‑edged sword to be honest and I've found over the years it put a lot of pressure, the expectation.   I think I've mellowed a little bit, and especially having won one, you realise people are behind you and encouraging you but you have to get away from that expectation.   It's not that easy to deliver all the time to win any tournament on demand.   You have to relax a little bit and maybe enjoy the applause, which I do, but don't get too carried away with the expectations.   
   
 Q.   On the eve of the championship, you said the pressure is off you because you already have one of these under the belt.   Presumably it's cracked up a bit on the weekend when you're in a challenging position.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   No doubt about it, but this is where you want to be and this is kind of before I was expecting to be.   Whether I can finish it off was more the curiosity coming into this week.   I did feel in decent form.   I've put myself in that position to have a look at the weekend and if it doesn't go my way, I'm sure I'll learn something from it.
