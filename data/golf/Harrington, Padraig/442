  Q.  Many congratulations on last week.  How are you feeling emotionally, a bit of a roller coaster for you.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, I'm obviously tired now.  You know, just trying to really get through today and, you know, be ready to go tomorrow.   
 Arrived last night and as I said, I'm suffering now, tiredness and just need to take it easy for the next 24 hours.  Thankfully I have a late tee time, and hopefully I'll be ready to go tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  How was Monday and Tuesday for you at home?  Did the phone stop ringing?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  A good day Monday and Tuesday indeed.  It's nice when you win and take time to enjoy it.   
  
  Q.  What about winning here this week?  This is obviously another big, big title.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I think it would be a difficult task obviously.  You know, any tournament, but a tournament of this quality and then a tournament on a venue that has not been one that I've done well on in the past.  You know, there's a number of factors set this week against me.  Plus, I'm tired coming in.   
 Yeah, it's a difficult job but somebody's got to try and do it.  I'm the only one that can win that million Euro bonus; why not.   
  
  Q.  When your back's up against the wall, it seems to bring out the best in you sometimes, as well.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  There's no question about that, but back's not against the wall, is it.  I won last week!  (Laughing).   
  
  Q.  Give us your thoughts on the course.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I really like the course tee-to-green.   
  
  Q.  Do you prefer the greens a bit later in the year?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, basically.  That's as simple -- I think the venue, the heritage here is great.  Tee-to-green, superb course.  What can I say?  I don't want to say any more.   
  
  Q.  You look at the roll of honour of people that have won, some great players, Faldo winning it, Ballesteros; a nice inspiration this week.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  This is another tournament I really would like to win, no question about it.  The BMW PGA Championship is our biggest event, and it is definitely something I would like to win equally.  Not quite as much as I want to win the Irish Open, but it's now next on the list after the Irish Open as the next one you want to win, so yeah, definitely.
