Q.  What are your thoughts reflecting the past five days?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Four shots away at the moment and a lot to reflect this week.  With tough weather like that, you look back at the missed opportunities; it was a long day to wait; come back out to 3 putt my first green and miss from four feet on my second green and didn't have my charge up the leaderboard.  We'll take it into next week and see what happens.
Q.  A busy few weeks, second major, U.S. Open not too far away, how is your game at the moment?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Game is good.  I've been doing things better, but I'm on top of most parts of my game.  You know, I'm happy enough with my form.  Just get a few things going in the week and we'll be there.
Q.  Ryder Cup in September, how important is automatic qualification for you?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I would assume it's very important, yes.  Of course that would be one of the goals, without a doubt.
