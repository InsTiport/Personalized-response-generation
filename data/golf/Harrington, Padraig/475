Q.  Just a case of putts not dropping today?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, you know, obviously that's how I feel, got to stay patient and hope that they will all drop on the weekend.  It's tough to take out there, you know, I seem to hit a lot of shots at the flag and again, they should have been wedges.

Just was coming up a bit short, a bit long, spinning back, something was happening and hitting good putts and not holing them.

You know, not too much wrong.  Hopefully, as I said, on the weekend, if I stay positive, maybe they will drop.
Q.  It does look as though you're going to be in touch by the end of the day.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I don't know about that.  I've got to think the course is there for the taking this morning, it really was.  You know, there are 65s and 64s out there.

I have to think somebody is going to do a decent score this afternoon and maybe the lead will be 12 by the end of the day.

I felt I needed to push a bit more and maybe get it to 8 myself to be well in touch for the weekend.
Q.  You're not worried about your Ryder Cup place but you're playing with someone who might not necessarily be worried about a Ryder Cup place, but he's worried about his form going into the Ryder Cup, Paul McGinley.  What did you make playing with him for two days?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I said to him when we finished, congratulations, and I said, you know, you'll be happy that that noose is not around your neck now.

The worst thing, can't be very pleasant trying to hold on to his position.  You look back now and you wonder why, because he's easily making it now.

Hopefully he'll realise that now the next couple of weeks and show his form, and he will.
Q.  In the same way you said about Paul that maybe he needs to get the qualification process out of his system to start releasing his good golf, the qualification system looked a bit long for you, too; will it make any difference to you having made the team?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  No.  Really that month of July, once I got my points up after the French Open, I haven't been too focused on it.  I've known what's happening because everybody's talking about it but I haven't been too focused on it.
Q.  You seem to have every part of your game working at some stage in the round, sometimes not always at the same time or the right time, when is it going to all flow together because it seems so close?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  You know, I've driven it really well for last two days, which is very important on this golf course, and if you drive it well, you know, you're well in position and you're creating a lot of birdie chances.

As I said, I've been happy with, you know, with my approach shots, and this golf course has a little bit of attitude and a little bit of working out, just not getting the ball to come up five yards short, just a couple of shots that could have been stone dead, all of a sudden    inaudible    that's the nature of the game.
Q.  On this course five years ago, you shot a 62 on Saturday.  You might not have to shoot that to get into contention, but you need a good Saturday round, don't you, just in general with the way the season has gone?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, I don't need to shoot a score like that.  I've been posting a lot of 70s and they are frustrating and it's frustrating when you feel like you had a 65 in that round today.  Hopefully I'll throw in one of those 62s. I generally do it when I'm not swinging too well, and I feel like I am at the moment.  When I'm not happy with the way I'm swinging, that's when I'm at my most dangerous.
