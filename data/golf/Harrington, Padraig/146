  PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Obviously I started off well.   Four birdies in the first seven holes.   I hit it close after that but couldn't get it in the hole, which is a pity.   
You obviously need to make the birdies out there, so yeah, unfortunate, I suppose, but maybe I'm saving them all for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Yeah, right now you're just five points behind.   
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah.   I made some little ground.   I could have made a lot of ground today.   I could have got up there ‑‑ I could have got to 28, which is probably going to be two or three, four points behind or something at the end of the day.  
You know, I'm still in the tournament.   There's no doubt about that, but I could have made my job tomorrow a lot easier today.  
   
 Q.   What was the biggest issue today for you?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I misjudged a couple of wedge shots, and I just didn't hole putts in.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   That'll work.   Thank you.
