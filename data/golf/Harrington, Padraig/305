  Q. Padraig, decent day, obviously pleased with that?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I'm very happy. Obviously 64 is my low score of the year, probably my low score ever around Akron. It was nice to shoot a score that probably was even slightly ahead of how I played. I haven't been doing that too often this year. There's obviously a long way to go in this particular tournament, but it is quite positive to shoot a decent score.  
  
  Q. You birdied the first hole --  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, you know what, I birdied the first hole and then missed a pretty short putt on the second hole. I was wondering which way it was going to go, but I made a nice up-and-down on my fourth hole, and from then on I kept things pretty steady. I had plenty of birdie chances, and it was only at the end where I holed a couple of putts that really turned a 67 into a 64.  
  
  Q. It must please you, the work you've been doing showing a bit of reward?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I'm very happy with the work that I've done. I think that's going to make me a better player going forward. I don't think that's necessarily going to -- doesn't make the difference on a day like today. It was the good, solid short game that shot the 64 today. But certainly going forward over time, not the last couple of years, but the last eight months that work will show up in my game over time.
