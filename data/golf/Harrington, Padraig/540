PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I resumed on the 15th all-square, so it was a four-hole match. First blood was going to be everything. I holed from about 20 feet and he missed from 12 at the 15th. It made all the difference. That was the problem with a four-hole match and coming out cold, whoever struck first was going to have a huge advantage. Fortunately it was me. Not easy.

It's a sprint and after playing 32 holes so well it was a super match and then a sprint. I won the 16th. He three-putted and I had two for the match from about 12 feet on the 17th and that was it. It all boiled down to that 20-footer and whoever got that first hole up. I was up at 5:30. Early start, but I am always up two and a half hours before my tee time wherever we are.
