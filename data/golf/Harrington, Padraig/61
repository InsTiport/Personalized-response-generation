Q. Assess what your day was like.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, it's strange how things happened.  I chipped in on the 10th hole.  I had two simple chips straight uphill afterwards and both of them I chipped by the hole and missed the putt like on 18.  So, you think chipping in could be a good thing.
I got a little bit cocky at the end.
Q. Tell me about what this golf course, what you found here that's made what you do to contend.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Oh, me, yeah.  I don't know.  Lot of things.  You know, this is a lot of things, swing things, mental things, putting things.  I can't tell you which one is making the difference.
I certainly feel really good about the game and I'm not too stressed tomorrow if it doesn't go well because I haven't had much time under tension.
This game is all about time under tension and clearly I haven't been in that certain position so I'm comfortable with where my game is at, all the aspects of it.  Yeah, very clear where I'm trying to go.  Doesn't mean I can do it but, yeah, I'm in a very happy place.
Q. How are you finding the course today compared to the first two days?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I don't know if it was a little tougher today.  I certainly played -- I played a lot -- had a lot more chances the first two days.  I played a lot better -- I felt like I played a lot better the first two days and today I obviously scored well in places.
I missed an awful lot of chances during the first two rounds.  That's what we expect.  With 156 guys, whatever, the first two days and with weather problems, they set the course up to get us around and we expect to get a bit trickier on the weekend, holes will be tougher, pins will be tougher and the par 5 and -- two par-4s were drivable today and couple of the par-5s, you know, were reachable.
It probably should have been an easier score today.
Q. Even though you missed the cut at Houston, did you find something there, especially with your irons?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No.  I've been happy with things for a couple of months.  I haven't been putting as well as I would like.  I went home the last couple of weeks and I kept working on the game and what I'm working on and I did some work on my putting and, you know, ultimately if you want to know why -- this is probably the answer, if you want to know why I'm doing better this week, I'm putting better.
Q. Pretty spectacular day.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Couldn't ask for better.  I know we had that storm but all three days on the golf course the weather has been stunning.
Q. The wind doesn't blow very hard, that's kind rare for here.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I fancy a bit of wind now.  I'd like to see -- as much as I know I haven't been there in awhile, I suspect I'll be panicking all day tomorrow.  Bit of wind with everybody else panicking, that would be a good thing.
Q. You said you haven't been in this position contending in awhile.  Does that give you kind of a sense of maybe being a little bit freer going into tomorrow?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No, not at all.  I think it would be the opposite.  I'm a great believer in momentum, of getting yourself in position time and time again and, you know, generally I know my last week came out of the blue but generally my wins have been -- I built up to and where I've been, you know, steady, in contention a few of the weeks and then finish it off.
