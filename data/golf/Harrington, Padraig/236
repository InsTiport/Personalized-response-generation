  Q. Your thoughts on a day where you've given it absolutely everything, shot a brilliant score. But looks like you may come up slightly shy.   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I think I'll just wait to see the tee shot on 18. Ross has done enough at this stage. Obviously he's played very well to shoot going out leading and looks like he's going to shoot 65. That's quite impressive, so fair play to him.  
  
  Q. Quite impressive from your point of view, obviously the short game has been incredible even by your standards; it's been special.   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I've had a few good ones. The plugged lie bunker shot that I got up-and-down with will go down as one of the best ever for me.   
 Obviously the others, the par 3 No. 6 was pretty good, too. That was playable, but at least I took it on. You know, whereas another time, I would have played it -- well, I wouldn't have but I took it on, anyway, and went with the flop shot. I went after it and it was nice that it came off.   
 A couple of shots like that were very nice. I think overall, you know, I've had a lot of chances today and I created a lot of chances, kept running the ball in the hole, and so, yeah, I'm more than happy with it.   
  
  Q. Talking about the next two weeks, Bridgestone and the PGA and the form that you're showing now?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I've been comfortable with my game for a while now. Even today at times, I just have to trust it a little bit more. You know, when I trust it, I'm hitting the ball great.   
 I just have to ease up a little bit, relax a little bit and let it happen, and, you know, I shouldn't get so stressed but maybe to get it up-and-down when I do have it, I guess I shouldn't be worried about missing but a little bit. I just have to let it happen a bit more.   
  
  Q. Looks like you've come up a little bit short today?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I obviously can't complain. You know, I went out there maybe looking to shoot 6-under and I did better, I shot 7-under. Ross has done very well. He's leading the tournament and he's going to shoot 65. That's a hell of a score to shoot when you've got everybody coming after you.   
  
  Q. Your form today, absolutely brilliant, you must have been happy with it?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: My form -- as I say I've been happy with my form. I just haven't been bringing it on the golf course or putting it all together on the golf course. Obviously today I played well and also my short game is sharp.   
 I obviously need both of those working hand-in-hand and today they certainly were.  
  
  Q. Lots to look forward to over the next couple of weeks and months?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: There's always lots to look forward to. That's the great thing about golf is there's always next week so matter what happens. I don't feel like I've lost this one, so that's okay. I'm not going to walk away from this at all disappointed. I think Ross has gone out there and won it, so look on to the next weeks. I'll just try to continue working on the same things, and I've just got to ease off a little bit, trying a little bit too hard at times, just let it happen.   
  
  Q. The Killarney experience, how has that been for you?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: It's been a fantastic golf course. It was ideal conditions all week. When the scoring is nice, good scoring -- the golf course really could have taken the players, really, this week. Thankfully for the weather, with hardly any wind, it's produced a superb event and it's been -- there was obviously a little worry at start of the week, I heard a lot of people worrying that the scoring would be low but the course has proved it's well capable of handling tour pros, and it's been the winner.
