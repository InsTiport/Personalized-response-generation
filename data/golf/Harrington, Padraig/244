 Q. Pretty sporty way to start. 5-under 65. You've got to be pretty pleased?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm happy, yes. I suppose it's always there, beware of the injured golfer. Expectations aren't quite as bold when you're out there. I thought it was nice to play well and did the right things at the right time.

 Q. This is a tough golf course, and you and plenty of others made it look fairly tame today. Why?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, conditions are as good as they can be. It is a tough course. If you're going to score the morning time, there's a bit difference of moisture in the rough. You're not getting the same flyers as you would in the afternoon and it dries out. So you got to get the score in the morning, and I'm not expecting it to be as easy for the rest of the week.

 Q. On the back-9 as you looked over some putts, you were almost like Camilo Villegas, the Irish spider out there. What was that all about?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Called a version of that. I wasn't even close to a spider. Yeah. I was trying to figure out how many times I was going to end up lunging on my left leg during the day. Would it make it to a hundred times. My muscles in my left leg are going to be tired the next stretch. I'm probably going to have a few pains tonight. That knee surgery two weeks ago, it gave me a bit of pain through 9 holes and stiffened up on the back-9.

 Q. Is it going to hold up, you think, through next week?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah. It's only getting better.

 Q. Thanks, Padraig.
