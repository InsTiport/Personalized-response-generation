 Q.  Your thoughts on that day, watching leaderboards quite a lot? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  At the end, yeah.  At the end we were having a look. 
 I putted terrible. 

 Q.  Didn't seem to be any spark in your game. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  There was. 

 Q.  No red figures on the board -- 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I did. 

 Q.  But the very first hole -- 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yes, absolutely. 

 Q.  -- you seemed agitated -- 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yes, I was in the zone. 

 Q.  And after you were no longer in the zone, on the next hole, you came up a bit short, did you miss it too short or was it a gust of wind? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I hit the shot like I wanted to.  The rest of it was a struggle. 

 Q.  It's been a good long season, and you've won the Irish Open, you've won The Open, I suppose maybe at the moment, it's not the time to be patting yourself on the back but obviously disappointed with the way things have turned out today? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Just because it was an opportunity missed.  If Justin finished 5-under, I wouldn't be disappointed, but you know, 1-under par, the winning score was obviously easy enough.  Even the last few holes, I missed 3-putts the last three greens. 
 I just wasn't in the zone and I wasn't focused.  It was hard work all day. 

 Q.  16th hole the one that hurts the most? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Not really.  Just the putt at 16, the putt at 17, you know, the other day, you knock those two in.  That's the way it goes. 
 It's just disappointment the way it's happened rather than anything else.  As I said, I think it would be easier to take if Justin was 4- or 5-under par. 

 Q.  Disappointing also because of how important the Order of Merit was to you? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Well, it is important, but it's a missed opportunity.  You know, it's one of those things that I look back at it something else to work on and, you know, something else to work on my game, yeah, basically, you know.  

 Q.  Struggle today on the golf course? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It wasn't that tough a day, but you know -- it was just like any other day.  I went from being, you know, right in there to having to dig deep and just play, struggling at golf, really.  I had the chances.  I had birdie putts or whatever, but worked so hard for it.  Of course it takes three days to get into that position, so it was a pity to lose it so quickly. 

 Q.  How did you feel playing the fourth hole? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  As I said I was right in the zone, I had not missed a zone.  My focus, my attention was spot on. 

 Q.  And the putt? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I just wasn't focused on it.
