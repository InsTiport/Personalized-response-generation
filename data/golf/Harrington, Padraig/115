Q.   Really couldn't get anything going today?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah.   Either I didn't hit it quite close enough or didn't get it close to create momentum.   Most of the day I hit nice shots.   You know, you need to hole a few putts early on, get a few birdies out there, because as I said, when you're not making birdies it feels like there ain't any birdies out there, whereas if you have a few birdies made, I think the golf course is easier.

Q.   Harris put up a 64.   It's out there to be gotten?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   This golf course plays the same every year.   Some guys can't shoot a good score.   Overall, over 72 holes nobody tends to get away too much.   The likelihood, it's a tough course to be leading on.   You know, probably if he finishes 10-under at the end of the weekend could still be the winning score.
