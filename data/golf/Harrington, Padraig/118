Q.   You didn't seem to play well today. 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I missed a few shots.   I misread and missed a few short putts at crucial times.   And I really lost a lot of momentum.   And obviously ‑‑ yeah, that's exactly the story of my day.   It wasn't, it was not a good day for me, no. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   14.   14, I needed.   In my head it looked like I was birdieing 13, 14, 15, to get back to level and it looked like I hit it in close there and ended up making bogey. 
I made three from the edge of the next green. 
I shouldn't have hit it over the back of 17, off a decent tee shot. 

Q.   Trying to get it in the bunker, were you?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I was just trying to hit it short right of the green and I just hit it too hard.   Another 3‑putt as well there. 
So a number of misreads on short putts missed, which you need to be holing them momentum.   And obviously it was a tough day after that.   A bad chip on 5 caused the double bogey.   A pretty straightforward shot.   When I look back at it, it's all short game. 

Q.   (Inaudible.) 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, but, you know what, it was a pretty simple chip on 6 and to end up taking double bogey, as I said, a couple of 3‑putts and a couple of short putts ‑‑ 8 again was another short putt missed.   It was a big momentum killer. 
It would have been nice to get back to level par and all of a sudden I'm dropping one at 9.   You know, it's that sort of day.   Every time ‑‑ yeah. 

Q.   Was it the reading the putts or was it the speed? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   The putting was okay, I just missed them.   I misread the one at 17.   I misread the one at 8.   I didn't hit the greatest putt at 14.   But then I had too many 3‑putts, too many missed opportunities, two chip shots missed.   I think back on it, it was all short game. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Well, it was a terrible finish there.   To lose three shots on the last two.   As I said, ball's in the air on 14 and I'm thinking, oh, pretty good.   And all of a sudden I'm, you know, dead.   Bad day.
