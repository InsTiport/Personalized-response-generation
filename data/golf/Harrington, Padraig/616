PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm obviously pleased with the score, but it was disappointing to bogey the last hole.  I was steady all day and nothing too exciting was happened until the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th to turn an average score into a good one.  I hit a tree on the 18th and that sent the ball deeper into the trees.  I hit a very good 6-iron recovery to the front edge and I should have been thinking of chipping it in, but I haven't been that confident with my chipping recently and I fluffed it.  My putting generally was better today, but to be honest, the five birdies came from hitting very good short irons.  I didn't hole too many long ones, but hit my short irons very well. At the 7th, I holed from 15 feet for a 2.  At the 13th, I hit a drive, 9-iron to two feet.  At the 14th, a drive, 9-iron to ten feet.  At 16th, I hit a sand wedge to a foot.  At the 17th, a wedge to three feet.  And although I recovered well at the 18th, I didn't hit the chip well at all.  I can't complain with that score.  66 is a good round.  Not quite my best, though.  I had a 65 here last year.
