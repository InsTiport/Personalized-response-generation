Q.  Was it just a case of rustiness?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Suppose so. Put it down to that.
Q.  How was the concentration?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Same. Bit rusty. Could have been better. Definitely. It was going well for a good while and just hit a few poor, slack shots. Concentration really. On the par five I laid up into the water and on the last hit a poor wedge with the wind swirling. I didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t really settle on the shot. Lost three shots on those two holes.
Q.  Was the wind making it hard to make your mind up?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I was thinking of going for the green but at the last decided to lay up and just rushed it. DidnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t make a decision.
Q. Few went begging on the greens?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  DidnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t really think so. The one on the last was very disappointing because I thought I had holed it. It is always disappointing when you go to pick the ball out of the hole and it doesnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t go in.
Q. How are the greens?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Good. Very good in the morning anyway. They will be soft I am sure so it will be very tough for the guys in the afternoon. I thought they were fine. I hit a good putt on the last and it missed. Missed one on the first and the last and didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t really miss any in between.
Q.  There were some nice shots out there?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Three iron into the ninth to about three feet. Hit some good shots. Just a couple of careless shots there which knocked me back two of three shots which is a bit of a problem.
Q. Was the extra day a blessing?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I was very happy to sleep all day yesterday. Definitely. It was a bonus for me to have the day off.
Q.  Do you build on today?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Oh yes. I will go and hit a few shots and hopefully it will get better. It was a pity to let a couple of shots go. Four under is a lot better than two under.
Q.  Was it easy to keep your mind on the job?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yes. When you are out there doing your job it is no problem. I would have liked to have been but we always want to be better.
Q. Michael Campbell is playing with a lot of confidence?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  IsnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t he.
Q.  It helps when you win a Major?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It does indeed. You have to be pretty confident to win the Major in the first place. You have to play with confidence to win it. He did that score today very easily. He had other chances out there.
