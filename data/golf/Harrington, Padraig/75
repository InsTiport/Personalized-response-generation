  PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     Two late bogeys, so disappointing.   16 and 17 weren't playing hard, so that's disappointing.   It's always disappointing to make a few bogeys coming home, and 2‑under would have been a very nice return, and level par seems‑‑ 2‑under, you're looking forward; level par, you're looking backwards.   That's the way it is.  
   
 Q.   Got a lot of good golf in in those 16 holes?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Some good golf.   I hit some nice shots at times.   Obviously struggled a lot on the greens, which is an issue.   So hopefully will be better tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You did struggle a lot on the greens, you said?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   What was the issue?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I just didn't hole putts.   
   
 Q.   On 17, I missed what you had?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I hit left.   I hit 9‑iron on to the green and 3‑putted.   
   
 Q.   Did the course get tougher?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I didn't think it got tougher with the wind.   I think it played into our hands most of the day.   It was good direction all the day.   I definitely don't think it was an easy wind.   
   
 Q.   Does the scoring surprise you?   Scoring is good.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, the course is there.   It always is on Thursday, but it was easy today.   A lot of the holes, like I said, the wind seemed to help a lot today.   There wasn't very many holes that it played tough on.   
   
 Q.   Hopefully good scoring day for you tomorrow.   You need something like that.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I need to do nicely over the next three days.   As I said, I feel like I've given up two or three shots today.   You're still not thinking‑‑ the end of this week, who knows.   You get to 8‑under par, you'd sit in the clubhouse, so I do need to play well from now on.   It's not like I need to go out and shoot 66 tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Great reception when you stepped on the tee.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, it was very nice.   
   
 Q.   If you had to pick out a highlight of the round?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   My four birdies were on the par 5s; three of them were 2‑putts.   
   
 Q.   Some good pars, as well.   Were you okay on 9?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I was unlucky on 9.   Hit 6‑iron, came back down the hill.   
   
 Q.   72 was the worst you could have shot.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Pretty much so.
