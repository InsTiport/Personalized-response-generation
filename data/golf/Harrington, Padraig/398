  Q.  You had the physios out there, what happened?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Just had a sore back but it had no effect on my swing. I didn't actually have treatment on the course. It wasn't affecting my play. I asked him before I went out about it, but I didn't actually have treatment on the course.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the match itself, you battled well?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:. I did, but I just wasn't with it out there, I made too many mistakes. He played solidly and I made three or four errors in the match. He played nicely, no question about that but I missed the sixth hole from the middle of the fairway and made bogey and handed him the hole and three putted the tenth from 25 feet so I handed him two holes there. I got a bit unlucky on the 15th as well, I hit a really good tee shot and ended up under a bush, not often you hit a really good tee shot and it ends up under a bush. But I suppose it is the nature of the game, but I also wasn't really focused out there, wasn't really good.   
  
  Q. Plans now?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  As soon as I can get out of here, I'm heading for home.
