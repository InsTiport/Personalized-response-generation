Q.  Contented with 3-under or a little frustrated?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  There were plenty of chances out there but I struggled a bit on the greens. Two or three better would have been okay. The golf course was set up easier because of the weather and there were a lot of wedges out there. I just missed a lot of putts.

I made only one real mistake when I hit my sand wedge into the water at the fourth hole. Besides that I was short range for birdie bar the 16th, where I holed a 15-footer for par.

I am struggling on the greens. They hadn't cut the greens but I found them faster than yesterday, which was interesting. The golf course is now very easy even in the bad weather, so I think the lead will be around 10-Under at the end of the day.
Q. Are you concerned with your game?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I am not concerned with my game.
