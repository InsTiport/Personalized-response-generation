 Q. Interesting strategy by Captain Faldo to take his biggest veterans and give them rest, something they didn't expect coming in. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I think you know, speaking of my own, I needed a rest. Worked really hard ovary suppose 53 holes I played. A little bit off of my game, so had to work hard to get the ball in the hole as best I could. 
 It does take a lot out of you. Yeah, it's important, it was a big hole today and this morning, because we did rest two guys, one who has not lost in 12 matches and one who has not lost a foursomes match ever, and we needed a big morning and we got that big morning. It definitely worked out for us. 
 So hopefully again this afternoon, certainly four-ball-wise, there's plenty of guys to take my place, so I'm not unhappy not being there. I'm struggling a little bit with my alignment this week and it's putting me off a bit, and I've got to try and find the key, so that I can play tomorrow. 

 Q. In hindsight it looks like a fine decision to sit a guy like Lee or Sergio in the morning because Oliver and Poulter showed up and did well and got some points, but the initial reaction from the team, what was that like? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Sergio asked for it. And Lee, I think Lee wanted to play, but you know, when he lost his partner, there was other options that opened up and it just seemed like a good decision by the captain to rest him. 

 Q. And you were fine with that?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: As I said, you know, we needed a big morning. We got that big morning. You know, you've got to be behind your captain when he does something like that, and as I said, it really has worked out. Maybe should have rested me this morning. You know, would have made it a bit easier for me, too, struggling a bit in four-ball. 
 I think we need a big afternoon. If we can win this afternoon, that would put us in a good position tomorrow, because we have rested players, and it looks like you know, the team is playing well. It looks like the guys are playing well, and that's important going into the singles to have some fresh guys playing well. 

 Q. Just to turn it back to you, obviously the last couple of Ryder Cups haven't gone your way, even though Europe has been victorious, what do you think is missing for you in this format; are you still drained from the majors? What's going on? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, you know, obviously I can't remember past the last Ryder Cup, I don't know what I did the one before that. 

 Q. Inclusive of this one. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, it's whether the team wins or not. There's so many things you can do behind the scenes that are important in a team thing, and it's always about just getting the points. Even though that does help, there are a lot of things that can work. 
 I think there's a few -- even yesterday, there's things, you can help out your teammates. I know I didn't have a great day, half a point out of three matches, and I worked so hard for that half-point, but you never know that, half-point might make the difference at the end of the week. If it doesn't and my team win The Ryder Cup, I'll be celebrating and you know, there's no joy in winning five matches if your team loses.
