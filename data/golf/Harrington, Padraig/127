 Q.   Solid round of golf.   I talked to you yesterday and you seemed like you were in a good, solid frame of mind getting ready to start your year out here in the United States.   Tell me about your round.   
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, it's a nice score, obviously, 7â€‘under par.   It's a little bit behind Phil but still a nice score in itself.   You know, I pretty much got the most out of the round for the first 15 holes and then had three chances the last three holes and didn't hole the putts.   But overall I've got a good feeling about it.  
   
 Q.   Do you think the course might get a little tougher as the week goes on?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, I think that's likely.   I still don't know the course that well.   I was hitting a sand wedge into 18, and I was very concerned about not going long, and when I got up to the green, long was the place to hit it, and I'd spun it off the green.   So I'm going to make mistakes for the rest of the week.   I know there's going to be a couple of errors here and there.   Hopefully, as I said, I can keep making enough birdies to counteract that.  
   
 Q.   I won't tell you about some of the places you don't want to know about; it works both ways for you.   
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, it's possible there are going to be some shots that are going to be dangerous shots that I don't realize.   Hopefully I'll get away with it, let's say, but I'd still prefer to have a bit of local knowledge.
