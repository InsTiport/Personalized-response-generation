 Q. What happened with that putt over 17?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, there's a bit of grain out there, and I was really -- I was trying with my heart not to start it right, and I succeeded. I started it left after the hole and it break a little bit. I was trying to hit it firm and straight, and yeah, I just was afraid of missing it right, and bad focus. 

 Q. Looks like you're going to have another day with Tiger tomorrow. How do you feel about it?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I look forward to it. We had a great day out there. We enjoyed it. It's where you want to be. If you're playing with Tiger, you're going to be generally there or thereabouts with a chance to win the tournament. 

 Q. With the FedExCup being like it is and Tiger is right there with you --
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, it's not good for me. It's out of my control whether I can win the FedExCup. You know, it's hard to see Tiger not finishing in the top two when he's leading the tournament after 36 holes. I think it's hard to get your mind around him not winning it after leading after 36 holes. 
 You know, I've still got the tournament to compete for, and I can only do my thing, and if I can go out there and play well over the weekend, and it would be nice to win regardless of not winning the FedExCup.
