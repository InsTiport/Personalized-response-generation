 Q.   Not the second round you were hoping for; tell us about your card.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It was a tough day, and I didn't get a great‑‑ I started okay, but missed a few chances for birdie early on and then I had a horrible 3‑putt on like my fifth hole of the day and that set me back for the rest of the day.   I was always a bit on the back foot.   When I did make a birdie, I dropped that shot quickly enough.   Just couldn't‑‑ my short game wasn't good.   Wedges weren't good.   Didn't hole the putts.   It always meant that I was, you know, just watching that cut line all day and that never gave me any freedom to go forward.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel now about the likelihood of being around for the weekend?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It's going to be tight at the end of the day.     Could be tight, unfortunate on the wrong side of it, or just about in.   But there's no way you could call it at this moment.   
You know, as I'm on the cut line, or on that plus one, I'll say it won't make it, because that's the way as golfers tend to go, we try and play it down.   But the reality is, having a look at the scores, assuming that the weather is‑‑ unfortunately hoping for the others that the weather is bad this afternoon, that might be the difference.   But they have moved up tee boxes anticipating the wind, so some of the tougher holes, they are not playing as tough as they could be.   
There's enough guys shooting 3‑under par, that sort of score, that a few of the guys who are going out there 1‑ or 2‑over will be able to move in.   So I really do think it's a tough ask.   But you know, it wasn't far lack of trying.   I didn't leave any shots out there through carelessness.   
It's the nature of the game.   Very tight, professional golf, between making it or not making it.   Even the difference between missing a cut and leading a tournament is just a couple of putts, a little bit of momentum.   So it's just the nature of the game and we have to accept it.   You're going to miss some cuts during the year and you just wait for your good weeks to make up for it.   
   
 Q.   I remember you saying Lytham 12 years ago, "I hate greens with subtle breaks."       Is that the key this week, you're just not getting the subtle breaks?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm struggling with the breaks really.   Exactly as you said, a lot of times from 15 feet, you're looking at maybe two breaks on the putt and there's not a consistent, okay, I can hit this four inches right and it's going to break right‑to‑left.   There seems to be a lot of changing a little bit; is it right lip, is it straight, is it left half.   
The only putt I holed today was on the 18th hole, my ninth hole, and I had hit it in practise and I knew the line.   That was the only putt I had holed all day.   The rest of my putts, I struggled, and I hit some good putts at times.   Yeah, it was a real disappointing day on the greens; for a day that I didn't hit‑‑ I kept hitting good putts, and kept rolling the ball at the hole.   I just couldn't seem to pick the right line at all.   
   
 Q.   People will see you wearing the glasses and know that that's hopefully something that you are hoping that would improve your reading of the greens; is that just not working at the moment?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I think it's the nature of the greens.   Some guys like flat greens.   Like I know a lot of guys who like to hit the putts that love‑‑ they don't want to aim outside the hole, they like to aim straight from 15 feet.   I like to use the break, and a lot of guys‑‑ well, I can hit a putt four inches right of the hole and the other guy will be hitting right half.   That's just the way people putt.   
I like to see bigger, breaking, faster greens, the sort at the U.S. Open where I putted very nicely.   These, they kept the pace reasonably slow because of the wind, and I had to remind myself to hit the ball a lot of times.   
As I said, because they are good quality, and they are fairly level, the ball is not, you know, not breaking as much as I would like it to be breaking.  
   
 Q.   You started with a couple of 66s last week in the Travelers Championship in Connecticut, and you could finish with that be there or thereabouts possibly.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I would love to have the opportunity, I really would love to have the opportunity.   As I said, I hit the ball fine.   Like three of my bogeys were all from like 135 yards, which are terrible.   The wedges I never got up‑and‑down.   
So, you know, those things, it wasn't a physical aspect of my game that was wrong today.   Just didn't score very well and didn't have the momentum, so, yeah, I could easily shoot two 66s without changing anything over the weekend.
