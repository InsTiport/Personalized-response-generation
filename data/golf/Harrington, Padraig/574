  PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It was a good day for golf and I got off to a good start but it was not a great score at all. Not on a golf course when it is like this. It was a funny round and if this makes sense, I played well enough to be four under but I didn't deserve it. I am just not making it happen at the moment.
