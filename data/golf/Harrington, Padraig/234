  Q. Are you prepared for next week?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, you know, I created a lot of chances again today. I struggled on the greens. Yeah, I'm happy. I really did create a bundle of chances out there. That's nice going forward. Yeah, happy with the game as I leave here. I certainly overdid the work this week, and I'm putting that down to too much time spent on the range has maybe upset my putting a little bit in terms of maybe I'm just a little bit tired or whatever, so I'm not going to worry about the putting thing.   
 I putted great last week, so happy with the longer game. The work has paid off, and certainly I'm happy with the amount of chances I created.  
  
  Q. Going into next week what's your schedule?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'll probably play -- yeah, I get up there Monday. Somewhere around 36 holes I'd say I'll play over three days, somewhere around that. Maybe nine, 18, nine, something like that. It just really is tapering down now. I'll probably do a little bit of work on the putting.   
 As I said, it was great coming in here. It was great earlier on in the week, I just created a lot of chances in that sort of 15-foot range, 10-to 15-foot, but yeah, they're hard to hole.
