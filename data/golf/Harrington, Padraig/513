PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Really haven't shot a good score in a while.  I don't think I've missed two cuts in a row in my career, so it's always nice to    I wasn't thinking about it going out there, but it was momentum going my way.  I made a few birdies, and then my ninth hole of the day, and when things are going your way you've got to take them.
Q.  Can you talk about the chip?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, it was a nice drive, trying to get cute with a 5 wood and cut in there and just came up a bit short in the bunker.  Straightforward bunker shot, straight up the hill, and when it landed, I thought it was down in the hole and it did.
Q.  Were the conditions    inaudible?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I have no idea what anybody else is doing to be honest.  I was just concentrating on what I was doing.  I did feel things were very tough yesterday.  You know, it wasn't    seems to be a bit windier today but the pins seem a bit easier.
Q.  Did you think that this would be more of a departure from last week?  It seems most guys are saying it's the Open, Part 2.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  You know, that's golf.  I consider this golf course    when I see a golf course I like, I enjoy playing, so I don't see the difficulties.  Maybe other people are seeing it.

But that's the nature, when a course is good for you, you tend to think it's not as hard as it maybe it is.  Last week's course I thought was very difficult.  It's really in the eye of the beholder.
Q.  And what about the success and being in the playoff since last year?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Well, certainly I'm a person who likes to come back to a course I play well at.  It just puts a little bit of pressure on you.  You think, well, I did well last year and I did this last year and you think you should do the same.  It's never easy with expectations like that, but obviously the course suits my eye and I'm playing well on it thankfully.  I've got a lot of work to do over the next two days, but I will certainly take a playoff on Sunday if you offered it to me and take my chances from there.
Q.  Were you in the water on 8?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Oh, I took a drop that was in the water.  That must be the toughest pin of the day.  I hit it in the rough eight times, and the eight times I was in the rough I couldn't make a green and that's a lot of shots to give up.  Just last couple of weeks I've been struggling out of the rough, and just wasn't getting the ball there.
Q.  How does it feel being on top of the leaderboard going into the weekend?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Two shots off the lead, nice position.  A lot of work to be done.  You just want to be there thereabouts with nine holes to play on Sunday, and anything can happen on this golf course.  That's the good thing about this course, a lot of the holes and pin positions, you hit a good shot and you can make birdie, a lot can happen in a final round there with a little bit of pressure on.  Birdies and bogeys are easy to be made.
Q.  How forward are you looking to the British Open?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I set out this year, there's no    if I'm here, there's no point in thinking about what's going to happen in three weeks time.  You know, it's all about this tournament.
