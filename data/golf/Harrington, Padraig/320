 Q. Not the Sunday you were looking for. Now we can look ahead because The Masters is next week, the first Major of the season. How do you feel?
 PADRIAG HARRINGTON: You know, it's awfully tough today. You start looking forward to next week and it has been a good week for me in terms of where my game is at. Lot of patience today. Well, you know, it was windy today. 
 Slipped a bit of patience today. Don't want to do that next week.

 Q. What was the slip of patience today?
 PADRIAG HARRINGTON: Hit a couple of average shots. The wind was getting up. Made a couple of bogies and it was -- you know, really be patient after that. I got frustrated about it.

 Q. The conditions this week, great preparation obviously for next week. Are you going to work on anything in particular between now and then?
 PADRIAG HARRINGTON: I have a few little things to work on. Probably just sit down and think about it now, couple of things need adjusting. The wedge play will be better. Few little things. Probably the wedge play.

 Q. You certainly proven you've got major game. Best of luck to you next week.
 PADRIAG HARRINGTON: Thank you.
