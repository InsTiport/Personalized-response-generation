Q.  Last time we were here at Gut Kaden you were lifting the trophy -- how does it feel to be back?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It has been a good event. I won it the last time here. I don't know what it is that suits me about the golf course. I ran it through my head as I was coming here on the plane and don't necessarily think I have any great advantage here. When you win on a golf course, though, there is obviously something about it that is good for you, and that gives you some confidence coming into this week. Sometimes you can pick it out on a golf course, the reason why you like it, but I don't know why it is here but obviously last time wasn't too bad.
Q.  How important was that win for you?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It was a very important win at the time. It was a big win for me. I needed one at that stage and the way it happened was probably the most important thing about it. To hole a good putt to get into the play-off and then to win the play-off. They were lining up more headlines for another second place at that stage. I think that was going to be 22 or something like that so it was good to win. I knew I would finish second again sometimes but it is always nice to get a win and to hole a good putt on the last to get into the play-off was very important.
Q.  Since then you have gone on to pick up a number of wins.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  You could say I have had a few more breaks since then, no doubt about it. I always say I am just doing my thing but I have had two wins in the States which, if anything, were against the head and I got the breaks. Maybe it all started with that week. My fortunes turned around with that win two years ago. I have certainly won more than I have lost since then whereas before that I had lost more than I had won.
Q.  The two wins in the States, what have they meant to you?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  By taking my card I had set out my stall to try and win a regular event on the US Tour and it happened very quickly after four weeks and I felt I was in great position to move on from that.

Obviously since then we had some particularly bad news with my Dad at that stage, and to be honest other than that one week, I haven't really played golf all year. I had one round at Mirasol (Honda Classic) to win and had a decent week at Westchester but that's it. I haven't really performed at all this year. It has been an interesting year and one I wouldn't mind seeing the back of at the end of it.
Q.  These are difficult times and last week in particular -- missing the Open Championship which would have been one of the highlights of the year for you?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I had no interest anyway. I said the week before my Dad passed away I would be happy enough to pack the clubs away and leave them for a year. I am not bad when I am on the golf course, but it is hard to get motivated when I am off the golf course to get on the golf course.
Q.  How have you found arriving here this week and trying to get that motivation?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I came here a day earlier than I would probably need to for a course that I know but that is just trying to get into it somewhat. It doesn't feel too good at the moment but hopefully by Thursday it will be okay.
Q. Have you had the opportunity to play the course?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I played three holes but then had to come in because of the rain. I will play a few more holes when I get a chance. But the course looks in very good condition, in very good order this week.
