  Q. Overall impression:   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I don't know why we didn't play for the four hours this morning. I could have been at the safari with my kids this afternoon. I would have been finished by three o'clock. I don't know why they wasted the four hours. Now they are faced with the situation where they have both nines in play and everybody is out on the golf course.  
  
  Q. Still do you think they'll get to play 72?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: They have to play 72 at this stage. I think there's a kind of a rule that they tell you during or before the third round, before the third round, whether they are going to play four rounds. The ball came straight out down the pin all day.   
  
  Q. At that rate do you see yourself catching him?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, I left a lot out on the golf course today, which is never a good sign. Probably the worst score I could have had. The ball came straight out down the pin. I could have been a lot closer a few times and made a few more birdies.  
 Hit the flag on the second, nearly holed my third shot on the fourth. Had chances nearly everywhere else. Hit a super shot into 12, we couldn't see where it came down and wondered if I was long. Actually I was short, probably my best shot of the day and I made bogey off it. Just one of those days. Every ball was coming out straight down the pin, I wish there were more days like that.  
  
  Q. Maybe tomorrow?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It'd be nice if they did
