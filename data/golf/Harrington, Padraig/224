 Q. Round of 64, is this perfect preparation for match play next weekend? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm obviously happy with the nice score. A little bit disappointed that I left a lot of shots out there. You know, it's an interesting day. It's nice to shoot a good score but certainly I should have been several better today and would have been nice to post a score and make the leaders have to think about it coming home.

 Q. Have you got what you wanted from this week?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I would have had that anyway. You know, the week before a big event, it's all about seeing where your game is at; whereas I struggled with my putting early on in the week, it was much sharper today. Yeah, there's lots of things that you work on during the week and definitely I don't have as much to do it on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday of next week to get ready.

 Q. There's been a lot written in the press the last few days; did you feel that you had a point to prove over the last four days? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: No. In the end of the day, it's impossible to prove any point like that. Everybody is going to have their own opinions and most people are pretty committed to their own opinion. So there's no point in many he trying to prove people right or wrong. 
 I have to do my own thing and play my own game, and not something I can control. So it's best to stay away from it. I haven't read of the press, I never do, so it's best to just play my game and see what happens. That's all I can do. 

 Q. Going back to 1999, you said there was so much excitement going into that Ryder Cup, do you feel the same excitement going into this one?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: It's a totally different experience. In '99, I was a rookie, I think I qualified very late, the last eventually, I think I holed a putt on the last green, it was -- my head was spinning for the whole week. 
 It was an experience -- it's hard to believe that I can remember that I was actually excited the whole way through the week, this time around, obviously got a pick, it's a totally different feeling going into it. Certainly the last one I was very tired going into it, it was a tough week, and I fought against a lot of things that week, fought my own game and just I wanted to rest more. It was an awkward week, anyway. 
 This time around, I'm heading there now, actually, getting in early. I want to get there. I want to do things. I'm enthusiastic. I'm ready to go. Wheres several year ago, you come into The Ryder Cup and you've had a long year and it's tough. This year, no feelings like that. Excited to get there.

 Q. And just finally, thoughts on who you're playing with Friday?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I'll settle for playing with any of my 11 teammates on Friday. In fairness to the whole team it's a very strong team, and we have rookies on our team but they are some of our better players. It's one of those teams that I'll be very happy if we tee it up on Friday, I know Monty said we are all going to play on Friday and that's nice. You never really know in a Ryder Cup until once you get out there and play the first day. You know, you can play very well and play all the matches. You can play average and play a couple of the matches. It's one of those things, it's a good idea to give us all a run the first day and see how we are all faring up to The Ryder Cup pressure and the golf course and everything else that goes with it.
