Q.  Nice finish there.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, nice to finish with three birdies.
Q.  Overall your thoughts on the round, it was a pretty tough day?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It was a tough day.  You know, it's always a tough day when things go away from you.  But that's the hardest thing on a windy day is if you can get off to a nice, solid start and keep going, it's never too bad.  It's when you're back is to the wall early on and you can't see a way out of it, it's always going to be a tough day.
Q.  How is the neck?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Fine.
Q.  Your thoughts on tomorrow, some ground to make up?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Six shots back I was, so I don't know.  What's Peter finishing?  So I'm six back.  What can I say?  I would have liked to have    it was a day if you played well, you could make a move, as I'm sure you've seen plenty of guys who have done that.
Q.  Not too many.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Well, I'm just saying you could.  It was an awful day.  It was very difficult.
Q.  Very front on the front nine?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I overplayed a few shots early on and I lost all confidence on the greens.  For me, you know, I played through the turn quite nicely, and I 3 putted 10 and didn't birdie

12.  So that's where my round, those two shots were two shots too many and appeared that I was playing well.
