  Q. What is the difference between winning and coming close this week?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I misread the greens all week. You know, I had seven three-putts, hit a number of other putts, and not that I hit bad putts. I just kept hitting them -- for some reason I kept hitting my right-to-left putts high, and I was seeing a right-to-left break that wasn't there.   
 So obviously I could have done better today. A couple of error in shots, but it just wasn't my week in that sense. I can't give up that many on the greens.  
  
  Q. When you look back at 2009, how would you assess the entire season?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It was a disappointing season in terms of results, but a very positive season in terms of the benefits. So I'm happy, I'm happy going forward. That's it. It's probably a good year to put behind me, too.  
  
  Q. We talk about this eight-week break. What do you do?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Practice.  
  
  Q. With your family, on the golf course and off the golf course to recharge your battery?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Just being at home, not having any deadlines, not having any schedule.  
  
  Q. Padraig, bogey, eagle, bogey to start your final round. What was it like early on?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, I hit a lovely shot down the pin in the first, I hit a lovely shot down the pin on the third. You know, slight misjudgments. Probably was a little bit aggressive, and you know, these things happen.  
  
  Q. You had that chip-in eagle at 16 to get back to 10-under and two shots back. What did that do for your chances there?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It gave me some chance. Obviously Jim Furyk finished strong, so he won the tournament. You know, that's the way it is.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the atmosphere out here this week?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's been very good, yeah. It was very exciting there today. There was a lot of -- you can hear a lot of cheering. This golf course lends itself to that, though, because there is a lot of chances to make birdies and eagles.
