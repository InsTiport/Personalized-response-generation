  Q. Good round today.  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm disappointed, to be honest. I had a lot of chances coming home. I hoped to play a few shots better and it would be right in there.  
 I was supposed to be in contention. It's always nice to play well on a Sunday. From that side it's positive. Certainly I'll be a little disappointed going to bed tonight.  
  
  Q. Was the score you had in your head "If I shoot this" --  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I was trying to shoot the best score I could. It's quite possible somebody could have had a good day and shot 5-under and run away with it. It was also very much in my mind 4-under par was probably going to be the winning score.  
  
  Q. Was the wind as bad today, or did it calm down a bit?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'd say it was a bit like yesterday. Wasn't as windy as the first two days, and, you know, the ball was moving. Certainly didn't have as much effect today.  
  
  Q. How do you feel going into next week?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: What I set out to do this week, I did. Preparation was good. Feels good. Keep doing more of this and maybe putt a little bit better next week.  
  
  Q. Do you think this course compares with next week?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I know it's not exactly like last week, but there's a lot of tough shots and you've got to hit the ball well and got to get your mindset right, and you can do all that, 72 holes on a really good golf course like this. It might be the same grass as next week. It's certainly a strong golf course. Probably as good a test as you would have the week before a U.S. Open.
