  Q. It's all about being there come the final day with a chance of winning. Is that really how important that putt on 18 was, to keep you in touch?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, there's no doubt. I went for the pin more than I would have if I was maybe a shot or two further ahead. I felt like I needed to make a birdie towards the end there after dropping one on 16. You know, certainly I shot the same score as yesterday but I feel a lot better about it.   
  
  Q. The way you've played this week, you've played very consistently and you've had a very good attitude you've spoken about. Going into the final day, probably a few shots behind, what is your perspective?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, I take playing like I did today, I couldn't have played any better golf than I did today. Created lots of chances. Really didn't put myself in much trouble. So I'll be happy if I do that tomorrow and just see if I hole putts.   
  
  Q. Just a roller coaster year, a bit barren for a few months and an awful lot of good form but no win. Is there to some degree the feeling that you're in a better state of mind in the year now, kind of calmed that you're playing pretty well again with a position to win?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I was in a great state of mind through the FedExCup in the States, got in contention every week, and I lost it a little bit when I came back to Europe, as you would expect. I was just pushing too hard.   
 I realised that only at the last event, and I can see this week how much better, how much easier it is, how much less stress there is when I get my attitude right.   
  
  Q. And you have taken some sort of expectation stress off yourself this week; tomorrow, it might just be a chance to chase this.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, tomorrow, I'm in a position tomorrow that it's just going to have to go right for me. I'm that far behind that I'll go out there and play golf and see what happens.   
 You know, well, there's not much; it's not like I have to turn up and play and see what happens. I can't really control it past that. You know, I think it's all in Lee's hands by looking at that leaderboard. I had not looked at a leaderboard until I came off 18 and he seems to be in great form if he plays like that tomorrow, it's probably beyond anybody.   
  
  Q. Could you chase this, do you go aggressively?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I think, yeah, I'm going to go very aggressive but no more so than today. I was trying to be aggressive all day today, bar my second shot on 16. I was going at all the pins and I'll do the same tomorrow.  
 The worst-case scenario for Rory this week is the two of them would be contending for winning the tournament. It would be much better if they were both contending for 30th place, then Rory would have it. It is tough. Lee has performed and he's in position to take it away from Rory. You know, Rory, you could see a good one out of him tomorrow. He'll put the pressure on Lee, and Lee is well able to handle it. It should be exciting.   
 Unfortunately I'll be in the middle of it so I won't get to see it.   
  
  Q. No. 1 coming down to one last round.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: That's what you always want, you want a playoff scenario, four guys with a chance of winning this week and now you're down to two. It's exactly what they want.
