 Q. Talk about the conditions out there.
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: The greens. You know, the greens are -- you know, the decision was made.

 Q. Greens are a little bit -- this is a normal day of golf for you in Ireland, right?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Certainly we would see weather like this, this wind, maybe a little bit cooler and what they tend to do is obviously have the greens a little bit firmer and slower.

 Q. All in all, you guys are used to this kind of delay, kind of get back out there tomorrow and do your best, right?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: That's all we can do. At the end of the day you just have to put up with it.

 Q. Good luck this week.
