Q. A 65 today, what did you do particularly well?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Pretty much everything.  Probably for me, you drove it well.  If I drive it well, I can score.  I drove it well.  I gave myself lots of chances.
Yeah, just kept it nicely in play all day.
Q. Tell us about this golf course.  How strategic is it?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: It's just a nice golf course to play.  As you said, there's a lot of options.  You'll see guys hitting different clubs off different tees on the same hole, whether you want to fade or draw it into the trouble or away from it.  It's a nice test of golf like that.
Some tough pins early on in our round that were up on top of shelves.  Even at the end there on 16, I was unlucky.  Went into the first cut of rough.  You have no shot to a pin if it's up on top of a tier.
You can get a break or two if you miss the fairway and it was an easy pin or a decent pin, you could get at it but there was definitely some elevated pins out there that you have to hit fairways to give yourself opportunities.
Q. Winning score last year was 20-under and looks again it will be a similar number.  Is that a different pressure knowing you have to break 70 every day to have a chance?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: They have toughened up the course a little bit.  They are using the back tee on No. 10 this year where they didn't use it last year.
To be honest, I don't think the scoring is as good as last year.  I know there's 6- and 7-under pars, but you start looking down further, 3-under is a pretty decent return for today.
Yeah, look, the greens are beautiful.  If you're hitting good shots, you can hole a lot of putts out there.  They are a very nice pace.  They are not quick, so you'll feel confident over every putt.  There's nothing slipping away from you.
I think the course gets more difficult as you maybe are doing better in the tournament.  So I certainly take 20-under par but you know, maybe a little less would be the winning score this week.
Q. Fantastic opening round.  You must have enjoyed things today?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I played nicely.  Didn't really get in trouble at any stage during the day.  Wasn't really out of position.  A nice number of chances, converted a few of them, and it was a pretty easy 6-under par, yeah.  I wish they were all like that.
Q. Conditions seem pretty good here today but this is quite a narrow golf course in places, isn't it.  So accuracy off the tee is important here.
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, there's no doubt, depending on the pin positions, and they have put a few pins up on tiers.  You have to be coming in off the fairway to those pins.  You've got to hit a good strike.
Yeah, you do want to hit fairways.  Today, mightn't have hit all the fairways I would have liked to, but I certainly kept myself out of any trouble, which is very important.
Q. Overall, the experience here, it's a fantastic golf course.  Everything looks in great condition here.  How much have you enjoyed the time here so far?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: It's a great course.  It's a great piece of land for a golf course.  Good turf and inside the pine trees.  There's a whole strip of these golf courses down here and they are quite impressive, all of them.  They are really, really nice to play, a joy to play.
