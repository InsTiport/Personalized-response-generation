PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Hopefully today's putting was the start of good things to come and not just one day. The difference is that yesterday I played well and hit it to 20 or 30 feet but if you do that you can b e the best putter in the world it's not guaranteed to go in from there.  It often happens that if you are playing badly, you have to hit more chips and you are left with shorter putts to hole and consequently you think you are putting better!

I have no problem with the birdies. The weather is pretty good and it's running fast, so it's not that long a golf course if you keep it in play. You can go at the pins and the greens are reasonably receptive. The difficult thing is trying to keep the bogeys off the card if you hit it into the rough. I can see the birdies but there is also a lot of difficulty out there. It's quite extreme, the rough.

Without a doubt I need a round in the mid 60s. To shoot a 68 today is okay but in the greater scheme of things you've got to be doing better than that if you are going to win a tournament. I need two good scores at the weekend.

It's different for me this year. Okay I am defending but it's a different course and it doesn't feel like I am defending. It's as far away from last year's course as you could possibly get.
