   PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: One of the Wilson guys has got cancer, and so I said I would wear the badge and the cap helps the badge stand out.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I have no idea, and you know what, I would say I'm the only guy in this whole theatre who has no opinion on it, none whatsoever. None. Some guys love it, some guys -- more positive than negative, but I don't have an opinion. I honestly do not have -- as I said, it's one of the Wilson guys, very young guy, 30 years of age, is ill, and the badge is there and the hat helps promote that.  
  
  Q. Is it male cancer?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes, male cancer. They don't like to use the other words because it doesn't -- that's how they term it is male cancer.   
  
  Q. Is this what you expected from your first round interview?   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: No, I thought I'd be talking about my birdies. Do you like it? Hands up, who likes it? Hands up, who doesn't like it? It's actually very warm and very comfortable in the wind. I would definitely wear it again in links condition.  
  
  Q. Did you consider a beret?   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: No, that's reserved for Bubba. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. What was the birdie on 17?  
  PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I hit a perfect tee shot down the right-hand side. I hit a lovely 9-iron to three feet, four feet, knocked it in. If I played golf like that all the time, I'd be great. I hit a 5-iron.
