Q.  How do you feel how the day has progressed?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It's been a great day for the team.  I'm happy to take the losses for the team if that's the way it goes.  Everybody else is doing great and hopefully tomorrow    we've got a lot of work.  Four points as we saw in '99 is not enough.  We worked very hard to get that four point lead, yet it really isn't that much.  Big day ahead tomorrow.
Q.  Playing against Tiger, a tough afternoon.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It's always going to be a tough game and, you know, at the end of the day, we're going to have to do something special as they seem to do.  Such is life.
Q.  Some great roars out there.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, we played well.  You know, it was tough.  Early on they holed a couple of putts to tie us and it looked like we had a great chance going down 16 and all of a sudden we're 3 down.  Such is the game.  But as I said, that's fine, I'm happy enough, we're four points ahead, the team is doing well.
