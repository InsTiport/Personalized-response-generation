PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: The rain today was persistent rain, which is awkward for us, but it certainly wasn't as tough as it was yesterday, no.
Q. In terms of your round today, I know you're not going to be around for the weekend, but satisfied with today's work?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I didn't drive it well again.  Didn't give myself a lot of opportunities.  So that's really where I stood.  I chipped and putted well but I just didn't drive it well enough this week.
Q. Birdie at the last --
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: It's looking a lot closer when I look here, but we had a good look at it coming down 18 and there wasn't enough numbers on the golf course.  We checked the 1-overs, we checked the 2-overs.  Literally at that stage, it was 71st and there was six guys on 2 and three guys on 1.  Just didn't look like it would move.  Have to go for it.
At least I had clarity in going for it.  I thought I had to make an eagle.  I wasn't in any doubt when I was hitting my second shot.  Going back now, I think if I had seen the scores now, I would be hitting a shot in doubt and would have ended up making four and missing the cut.
Q. You'll always go for it no matter what, even if you just needed a birdie.
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Hit it in the middle of the green and try and 2-putt.  The one thing I didn't want to be was trying to hit it in the middle of the green and that not be enough.
Q. You wouldn't have laid up?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I was well down.  I hit a good one drive.  I only had -- I was well down, 200 yards to the pin.  I was hitting a little 6-iron.  It was a long way down.  I hit a very good drive, and I hit the hole with my chip.  I thought I chipped in, which would be nice.  I'm hoping it's going to be one too many, because it would be a sore miss if it wasn't but as I said, we were in no doubt.  When I was hitting my second shot, I hit driver up 17, and we were in no doubt I needed to get to 2-over.  Such is life.  There you go.
