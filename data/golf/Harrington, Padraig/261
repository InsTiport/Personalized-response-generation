  Q. You were playing pretty well last week?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I played well today. He out-putted me. I putted badly, he putted well. At the end of the day in match play, it's huge who putts the best.  
 Not to have the lead after the first eight holes, you know, he was in the driving seat in every one of them.   
  
  Q. You thought you could have won a couple of them?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, on the face of play, I should have been quite -- I didn't hole a 10-footer, but he holed them all.   
 I thought things turned a bit for me when I made a good up-and-down on 12. And he's in trouble. I'm on the green. He made a really good chip and I have a three footer. That was a killer.   
 The problem was, you know, having not taken the lead, you know, early on, I couldn't give up the lead and I just gave it up so easy on 13. He played lovely.  
  
  Q. He did what he always does.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes. Yes, he did. And unfortunately at this time of year, and it's always the case when it comes to this match play, but I'm not sharp enough, that I did need to raise my game towards the end and it just wasn't there.   
 I'm more than happy with how I played. I'm happy with every aspect of my game, but it's just not ready for -- one off. 72 hole stroke I'd be doing nicely, and still in the tournament and be quite comfortable and happy with where I'm at. But unfortunately it's not, it's match play and I just didn't have it. I didn't have the ability to raise it. Every year it's pretty much the same at this event.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No, I lost.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No, I struggled. It's just too early in the year for me.
