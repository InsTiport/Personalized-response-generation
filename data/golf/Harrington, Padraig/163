  PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Plenty of positives.   Some I can't tell you (chuckling). 
I played well.   Hit the ball well.   Happy enough.   Tough to hole the putts on the greens.   Tough greens for that.   But I putted well.   Overall can't complain.

Q.   Not the best place to be coming in you're sort of working on your putting. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Well, if you hole putts, you hole putts and you feel good; and if you miss them, you miss them.   I didn't hit very many bad putts.   Didn't hole very many putts but I didn't hit many, so that was positive enough. 
But you would want to be putting, you would want to be quite confident on those greens, no doubt about it.   Those are not greens to be in any way questioning or doubting your reading or anything like that. 
So in that wind, as well, crosswinds and things, you want to be confident. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I hit a good tee shot, hit a very nice second shot.   Probably hit it six feet away from where I wanted to go, and it just fell off the back edge of the green and I putted from there into the water.   Putted up to five feet and then I missed that one. 

Q.   So the coming weeks, you're looking to get some rhythm I take it. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   There's a lot of good stuff.   I'm certainly not searching for anything over the next couple of weeks.   That's probably the best I've hit my putts in certainly 18 months. 
So a lot of positives to take from that.   I really did hit the majority of my putts really well.   So happy with that end of things and I'll just keep working on what I've been working on this week, because my tournament ended on the second hole.   Happens. 
That's a long way back on a golf course that clearly I'm not comfortable on.   It's tough.   I played a lot of decent holes, but there you go. 

Q.   Catch up with Pete Cowen in the week off, will you? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I've talked with Pete and happy with how things are.   I'm not going to find it in the ball‑striking, that's for sure.   I might find it a bit better in a bit of decision making and stuff like that, routines.   My chipping has come back strong the last couple of weeks.   My putting, I really found something good this week, so very happy with that.   And the long game was good.
