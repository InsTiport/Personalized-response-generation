  GRAEME McDOWELL:   I was pretty aware that I had to make the putt.   It was a slow couple of days really.   I didn't make a lot of putts, as all.   Played very averagely and putted worse.  
Jamie played very well.   I was hoping myself and PÃ¡draig could be kind of dragged along by him but we both struggled and very much struggled on the greens.   I look up the leaderboard and I see 9‑under par and I wonder, how, you get to 9‑under par around this golf course.   It's phenomenal scoring.  
Obviously I want to be here for the weekend.   Desperately wanting that cut to come back to plus one and give me an opportunity to get back on this golf course.  
   
 Q.   You yourself were hovering over the cut line on the back line, how much pressure do you feel in that situation?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, normally when you're on the cut line, it's not a nice feeling.   It's kind of a horrible experience.   You always want to be a couple of shots inside the cut line going into your second round so that you can move away from it rather than be moving towards it.   
Unfortunately I had an early bogey, a bad early bogey, and the rest of my day I was sitting on it and thinking about it, and trying hard to get away from it.  
Actually I felt all good all day that I would.   I really did think that I was going to make enough‑‑ make a couple of birdies coming home, but I didn't.   Now I'm stuck on the same score as Graeme, and Graeme was so lucky that‑‑ he didn't have any luck today so he must have some left for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Jamie was saying yesterday there was a bit of banter flying about between you boys, was there any today or was it all too stressful?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I would say it was banterless out there.   It was difficult conditions and we were both battling to try to get back into this golf tournament.   
To be honest with you, I'm really shocked how good the scoring is.   I really thought 1‑over would be safely in for the weekend, decent bit of breeze this morning.   
But the guys are finding their way around this course.   They bumped the tees up this morning in anticipation of the forecast and made a few of the strong par 4s a little easier.   
Some good scoring out there.   Fingers crossed, not wishing any ill on the field, but we need them to come back to us a little bit.  
   
 Q.   On the range yesterday we saw you with something under your left foot and our commentators are going, what is that for; briefly, can you explain what it is?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I think it's called a Chango Paw.   It's a‑‑ I don't know what you call it, a destabilising, just makes my left foot have to work very hard to balance, stabilise.   It's certainly helping me in my swing.   I changed my shoes this week, actually started wearing FootJoy M Project, which are more akin to helping your feet work.   They let your toes spread a bit.   It just seems to give me a bit more‑‑ well, I have to work harder with my left foot and that seems to be helping my swing a bit and giving me a little bit better hit on my drives.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   There wasn't going to be a short answer to that question, was it.   (Laughter).
