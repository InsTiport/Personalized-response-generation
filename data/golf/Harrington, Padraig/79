Q.   You birdied the par518 to shoot a 3‑under 67.   How good do you think that 67 is in these conditions? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Well, I'm very pleased with it.   Yeah, certainly going out, you'd have taken level par, anything around level par.   I got a good bit of momentum going early on and made a few mistakes but recovered.   On a windy day, if things are going well for you, you do tend to be able to make a few birdies coming home.   If you're a couple over par early on, you don't see anyway out, but thankfully as I said, got a decent start which is so important. 

Q.   If the wind persists throughout the week, as it's expected to, what kind of mentality will you need to have? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Same one I had today.   You're going to hit‑‑ there's a lot of tough shots, a lot of tough tee shots.   A couple of tee shots that you're really under pressure to hit the fairway in a strong wind.   You just have to man up and hit the shots, that's it.   We are going to hit a few bad ones but you've just got to stand there and try to hit the right shot at the right time and accept your fate. 

Q.   What part of your game will you really need to focus on in these tough conditions? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Everything.   You'd like to drive it well because the rough is heavy enough and keep it in play, and outside of that, you really want to have a very solid short game because you are going to, you're not going to be able to hit all the greens out there.   There's no chance of that.   So you're going to have to get up‑and‑down and hole a few 6‑ and 8‑footers out there. 
So, you know, if I was going to pick one thing, because I picked three already, I would go with just a good, solid mental game. 

Q.   Nice little Irish breeze. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, if I had come from Ireland, I probably would be thinking it was a nice day.   But having played the last four weeks over here, even I was struggling and questioning and doubting myself out there.   I found it very difficult. 
As tough as the day was and it was playing tough, I kept telling myself, it suits me more than most guys.   There was an element of don't get down on yourself, this suits you better than possibly everybody else, so stick with it.   But I did find it difficult.

Q.   Something today that you take into tomorrow from a consistency standpoint?   You just stacked two good rounds together?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   No, not really.   Just carry on.   There wasn't by any means, nothing of perfection.   Just going to have trust it that it's going to be there when I hit a few bad shots tomorrow and just try and recover.
