 Q. Third consecutive 71?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well yes, nothing really happened today. Overall I felt better about things but I just didn't hole the putts out there today which might have made things happen a little bit for me. It would have been reasonable to turn today into perhaps a 69 or something like that but I don't have any complaints about today. Happy with where I stand.

 Q. A touch of frustration for you today?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Not really. I didn't hole the birdie putts but I made a few up and downs so that is okay. It is important to keep making the up and downs and if you do that, the birdies will start to happen again.

 Q. Are you using today to plan ahead for the next few weeks?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I was playing for the sake of this week but now it's over I am starting to look ahead and it gives me a good idea of what I need to work on going forward. It hasn't been ideal up to now but I am comfortable with my game and, as always the optimist, I do feel things are going in the right direction.

 Q. Looking ahead to Bay Hill, what do you like about the place and the tournament?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I find the course tough actually and I haven't been back in a number of years, it really is a tough course but it suits my schedule to be there this year and I look forward to seeing if I can master the challenge this time round. I certainly wasn't up to it the last time I was there.

 Q. Arnold turns 80 this year. When the name Arnold Palmer is said, what does it mean to you?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: We all think the same about Arnold, don't we....actually I was in a restaurant the other night and somebody ordered an Arnold Palmer (a drink of lemonade and iced tea). That says it all that you can go into a random restaurant and order a drink named after a professional golfer. Even Tiger hasn't got there yet!
