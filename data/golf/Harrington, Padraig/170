Q.   You posted five, that's a pretty good number to post early today. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     Yeah, I've got to say, it was the nicest‑‑ this is my 13th time playing it, and the least amount of wind was there today, so the scoring was on.   I don't even know if five is going to win. Normally five is good enough, but it could take six today. 

Q.   Was there a memorable shot? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   The whole thing is memorable.   You know, nothing in particular.   I didn't hole out.   I didn't hit anything stone dead or anything like that.   Actually pretty average shots and played nicely for nine holes. 

Q.   And your children are with you?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Eight‑year‑old Patrick and CiarÃ¡n, four.
