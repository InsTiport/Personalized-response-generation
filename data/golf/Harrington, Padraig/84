Q.   A disappointment? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, you obviously needed to be better today and certainly it was‑‑ I played well enough to be a good few shots better.   Yeah, you know, leaves me a lot to do tomorrow.   If I was 8‑ or 9‑under par, I'd be quite happy.   Back at 6‑under, it really does need a big day tomorrow.

Q.   And how much of a knock to your confidence was the double bogey in the round? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Not really.   Just disappointed at first.   I hit three wedges in the first three holes, all landed in around the hole and spun back to 20 feet and one released ten feet.   You just can't legislate for that.   I just wasn't‑‑ I hit a bad shot in the water.   I can handle that.   I just wasn't getting‑‑ things just weren't going for me today. 
So bad shots are going to happen every now and again.   It's the rest of it that was a little bit disappointing.   I hit a beautiful shot into 9 and bogeyed that; another day it would be a birdie.   That's the nature of golf. 
You know, just couldn't get the ball in tight to the hole.   That seemed to be the problem.   I hit a beautiful shot into 9 and I'm looking at it coming down and thinking it's coming down stone dead and I end up taking bogey over it, going over the back of green.   Made a good bogey there.
10 I nearly chipped it in there for eagle and didn't make birdie.   It was a strange day.   I couldn't get anything hang.

Q.   It was a momentum‑sapper, that tee shot on the third, the one that went into the water. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Not really.   I hit a bad shot.   You can handle that.   I think the momentum or the loss at the fourth, three nice shots and didn't make any birdies on them.   I hit it stiff on 6 and 16 and 18, but I have to hit the ball stone‑dead to make a birdie this week.   I'm really struggling; 10 is a perfect example.   I nearly make eagle and I end up making par. 
Not getting it done in and around the hole.   Struggling a little bit with the swirling wind.   That's really, whether it's creating a bit of doubt or just not getting the job done with some of my wedge shots. 

Q.   You have a chance tomorrow, albeit from fairly far back.   Is it in your game to attack or do you just take what comes to you out there?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm attacking all the time.   Always do.   Obviously back at 6‑under par, I need a very big day.   The leaders haven't gone far away, or I don't know what they are going to finish. 
If I was 9‑under par, I'd be reasonably comfortable going into tomorrow.   At 6‑under par, I need a very, very big day.   But those nice shots to finish and I'll be there or thereabouts.
