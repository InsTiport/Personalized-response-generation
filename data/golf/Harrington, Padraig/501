Q.  Good win.  Pleased with that result?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm very pleased to have won.  To be honest, he probably    we both played okay tee to green, and he just putted badly.  And once he gave me the opportunity, he three putted 7 and 9, I closed out the match after that.  I just wasn't going to make any mistakes after that.  So basically it came down to front nine, he was inside eight of the nine holes and I was happy with that.
Q.  Did you take your chances when they were there?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I just played average and he just made a few mistakes.  Obviously I capitalized on those mistakes, rather than me doing too much spectacular.  He made a few mistakes.
Q.  That's what it's all about in match play?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Sometimes.  If it looks like your opposition is doing that, it's just a question of letting them do it.  Other times you have to raise your game.  So it was nice, as I said, he made a few mistakes, and I was making sure I wasn't going to give him an opportunity back.
Q.  Anything you're working on for tomorrow, now, anything in particular that
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I'm a little bit in between swings at the moment.  So I'm not as    I'm not too confident on the course, but I'm caught between two stools.
Q.  What are you going to do?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  That's just the way it is, I have to put up with it.
Q.  Any thoughts about the match tomorrow, another tough one?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Not really, no, just thinking about myself.
