 Q.   Talk about your round today?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Obviously I seemed to tire up at the end, last couple of holes.   Just was a bit of a mental struggle, I was in very nice position, and can't really afford to give away those.   But my playing partners came in on two holes.   
I played nicely the first sort of 13 holes, and I played poorly the last five holes.   Tend to remember the last five.
