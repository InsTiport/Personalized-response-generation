Q.
A tough day out there today, Padraig?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It certainly was.  I found it very hard to focus.  It was one of those days where I tried as hard as I could to get plenty of energy and to try and focus, but my mind just wasn't settling.  It was a tough day to play golf in those conditions.

I need a rest, but I'm not getting one.
Q.  (Inaudible).
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Same as it was Thursday, same as it was last week.  I do need to have a rest because it was such a mental tiredness out there.
Q.  All in all, are you satisfied with the week, Padraig?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I wouldn't be satisfied with that, no.
Q.  17 was a bit costly, wasn't it?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah.  You know, feeling good, I tried to go up the left side a little bit to reach it in two, and I went the long way in the wind.

These things happen.  Maybe if I didn't really think -- I wasn't afraid of the water, I was more afraid of pushing it into that tree on the right.

These things happen, as they say.  It would have been nice to get a good drive away there, and obviously it would have been quite different to the finishing position, but I got away with numbers of things before that, so I'm not going to rue one mistake on 17.
Q.  You went in one side of the lake and dropped from the other side?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yes, it's a lateral hazard.  You have five options in a lateral hazard.  I knew that would stump you.  There's five options when you're in a lateral hazard and three options in a water hazard.
Q.  Which one did you take?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I took equal distance from the hole on the opposite side of the lateral hazard.
Q.  This was possibly, potentially one of the biggest -- (inaudible)?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  No, not really.  You know, I knew my focus wasn't great on the range, but often that happens.
Q.  And you're waiting for it to kick in?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  You go on the golf course, and it wasn't.  I struggled the first couple of holes, and I kept struggling away.  It only gets -- well, I stayed patient, stuck with it, and I did hit a few good shots there the middle of the back nine.  I was quite comfortable actually coming -- I felt okay.  The two shots I hit down 18, you know, you do get it back a little bit, but it was tough early going.
Q.  How much did you want to do it for those people?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  There was a lot of people.  Obviously I wanted to win for myself as well as everybody else.  I was trying hard enough for myself.  I didn't feel any extra pressure, I just -- it's just another -- I do need a break.  I've got to find some way of getting some rest in before next Thursday.
Q.  Compared to conditions today, with the breezy windy day -- (inaudible)?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  My caddie pointed out, it would be a good day in Rosses Point.  You'd be going off the first tee saying, "This is great."  And it would be.
Q.  Wouldn't it be great to have this in the Ryder Cup?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  No.
Q.  Why not?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  We beat them in the sunshine last week (laughter).
