   PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Tough enough day, scoring was actually an easy day. Felt difficult enough. Things you're not making enough birdies or whatever, you assume it's one of those days that you get on top of things and you're 2-under par, it's easy to keep going forward rather than just hanging on there. 

 Q. Trying to find that little spark? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, obviously it was very much that way, a couple of times I looked like I could have moved on, kicked on, sixth hole middle of the fairway, hit a 4-iron and made bogey instead of birdie, and the same at the last. Either time I'm thinking of moving forward and I end up moving backward. It's kind of like that at the moment. Just have to stay patient and work your way through these things.

 Q. Is it hard to work with your coach working on a fairly sizable maneuver in your swing and playing to play in a tournament?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It would be if you were doing that. I'm very happy with how I was swinging it today. No problems that direction. No, just a question of waiting it out and being patient.

 Q. Tomorrow, 25-mile-an-hour wind forecast, maybe that's what Baltray links needs, what you need. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: As I said, I would have done the course tough as it was today, 25-mile-an-hour would certainly help me in some shape or form, but it will be a tough day ahead of us. Certainly will need a tough day in any shape or form to bring myself back into the tournament.

 Q. And you need to do better on the par 5s? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, 2-over, I hit a really nice drive down the second in a left-to-right wind and it moved five yards into the wind, which was a surprise. I hit a lovely 8-iron over the pin and left it short on 9. Hit a nice 6-iron into the third. Maybe I was trying to hit the green, which maybe I should have been trying to miss it right, chip-and-putt it. Made the penalty for that and only made par. 
 Fourth hole, I hit 4-iron in there and I decided, well, let's play this one safe and tried to miss this one on the right-hand side and chip-and-putt it and I hit it close, and so I was on the downslope, which is obviously a rare occasion and hit a good chip and it missed the green and chipped it three feet and missed that.
 The last, hit the fairway again and hit a bad second shot but 3-wood off the downslope, you know, it's a tough shot, but probably hit equally as bad the next shot and wasn't too far away. I was only 30 feet from the hole. 
 It's an interesting game, just this is the nature of the game. As I said I played the par 5s 2-over par, and if you look at Baltray, most of the scoring, there's plenty of eagles there. You certainly -- my four tee shots, if they had stayed left, would I have expected to play them 4-under par. 
 Another time I will, and I have to understand that that's the nature of the game at times. That's the way the game goes. Some days, it just doesn't go with you and a good day, everything goes and you're on top of the world. 

 Q. You're amazed at how good the scoring is? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, it wasn't very windy, and if you get on top of things and you start -- a lot of times I'm looking at the hole and it looked small, or first couple of holes I lipped out and then after that, I was never very sure on the greens. I think if you get a run, as I say, the par 5s give up a few birdies out there. If you're confident and you can hole the odd putt, there was not that much wind. The pin positions were easy; I could see it happening, yeah. But it didn't seem like it for me, that's for sure. 

 Q. Do you get depressed when things are going against? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It would be easy to go that way. No, you have to make sure you don't and be patient. I did a lot of things right today and I'll just keep focusing on that and you know, not worry too much about the other stuff, because as I say, it does go like that, in ebbs and flows and in three months' time, I could be on top of the world. So I'm not going to worry about not having a good run. 
 There was a lot of positives, and yeah, I felt good about a lot of things, actually today, strangely enough. And you know, I did a lot of good things, and just the overall picture wasn't great, but I would have been very happy with the majority of what I did out there. 

 Q. Your confidence?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I wouldn't be buzzing with confidence but I would generally be ignoring that end of things, and most of my putts, I fired at the hole, I ran the ball nicely at the hole all day. I wasn't -- yeah, I played like I was confident, even if I didn't hit the shots like that. But you know, in general, it was pretty positive out there, I've got to say.
 The only thing that wasn't positive was the score. 

 Q. Miraculous that so many people can be --
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: The way the ball was on the downslope. It just came out sideways, and that ball was going to bury. It was always going to bury. I was hoping it would carry into the hospitality. It was just diving in there. We knew when I hit it up there, that nobody had seen it, nobody had nosed around and it was always going to bury with the type of flight that was on it. 

 Q. Is that why you want the wind so much --
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I wants anything to try and bring myself back into the tournament. I don't know; if there was no wind, I would be happy if I went out and shot 8-under par, but if there is wind, maybe 4-under par might be as good as 8-under. That might seem more realistic.
