  PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     Disappointing day.   I got off to the start I needed to‑‑ it was quite windy for our front nine holes and then it died down a bit on the back nine.   I didn't really push on‑‑ well, I made a few mistakes, and unfortunately the beautiful afternoon, the leaders may move ahead quite a bit.   It's never nice when it's outside your control. 

Q.   I presume after 11 holes there was nothing disappointing because everything was moving in the right direction?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, it was all going very nicely as I said.   It was fine, too.   I made a couple more birdies after that.   So you know, the double bogey, a bit upset about the two 3‑putts at the end.   That was a pity.   8‑under would have been a nice return, 6‑under for the round, 8‑under for the tournament, and I can forget about the double bogey.   But as I say the two 3‑putts are the ones that hurt a lot more. 

Q.   That peak that you mentioned on Wednesday, is that getting closer, you feel? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   You're seeing the average at the moment.   The average has improved. 

Q.   But you're in a fine position, aren't you. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Well, I may or may not be by the end of the day, though.   At the moment I'm in a fine position but at the end of the day, I think I was 16 going out; I'll be doing well to be 16 by the end of the day.

Q.   Do you look at potential scores needed to win the tournament, given the wind picking up in the afternoon and the red on the board?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   The wind is dying down this afternoon, that's the problem, but I believe it will be windy at the weekend.   We'll wait and see.   Depends how firm the greens are; the pin positions; the direction of the wind changed obviously today.   Yesterday, like 18 was incredibly difficult in off the left and today it's in off the right and it's actually not a bad hole.   It might be only a 45‑degree wind change but it makes a substantial difference to some holes.
