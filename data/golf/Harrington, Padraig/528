Q.
Bad luck?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It's never nice to lose.  But it wasn't bad luck, he played very well.
Q.  Almost feel a little better    (Inaudible).
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Well, I don't walk off the golf course often, and maybe that's just the early season, but he certainly deserved to win, no question about that.
Q.  Were you wishing you could have done something defensively in that string you had in the middle of the round?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah.  As I said, he was playing very well.  I played well early on and I needed to do something coming home and I didn't.

It was a bit like this a couple of years ago.  It's very hard; when you're not competitive it's hard to raise your game.  He played very well and I was struggling a bit, and I felt that 15 and 16 obviously did it.  It was all in his hands, not in my hands today.
Q.  Where are you playing next?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I play Doral next week.  That's the plan.
