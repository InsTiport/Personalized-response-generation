 Q. How good is a 70? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I don't know. Some scores are better but at Carnoustie anything under par is always ok. I struggled early on and then had some chances later on so I'm happy that I turned it around. 

 Q. Could it be a break to get this course out of the way in these conditions before the wind arrives?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You have to think that way. It doesn't give up too many birdies. If it is windy then some people will have bogeys when the weather comes in. It's always good to have this golf course out of the way. It is in super condition. The greens are probably the best of the lot out here. On a tough day though it can be tough at Carnoustie. 

 Q. Do memories of you Open Championship win come flooding back every time here?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah absolutely. It's interesting because when you arrive there's little things that remind you. I was in this position or that position or I got away with that. I think on every hole there was something that jogged the memory. 

 Q. You have had top tens in a row in America how good are you feeling about your game? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah it's been great. But it wasn't today. That's the nature of golf. I had high expectations going out today and it took me a while for me to get my head around it. When I did I actually played quite nicely coming home. I seem to play well when I'm confident. 

 Q. St Andrews tomorrow - is that special even for players like yourself?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah standing on the first tee and 17th, 18th there's so much there. Everytime there's just something special there and the hairs stand up on the first tee.
