   Q. Talk about your round today.  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Obviously I think the putt hurt me more than anything else. And it's, I missed a lot of putts out there. I have to be better over the next three days.   
  
  Q. You shoot 74 in the first round, in normal circumstances holing putts do you feel a lot more energized than you do with a day like that on the greens?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I really can't, I couldn't tell you any different. 74 is 74. It would have been nice -- obviously, always missing a short one on the last green is always not a nice way to finish and certainly it leaves a sour taste at the end of the round. And so 73 would have felt a lot better than 74.   
  
  Q. How damaging do you think this score is?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I have no idea. It's still, I still have 54 holes to go and I don't think actually it's going to make too much difference. What's damaging is I got to putt better. And that's it.   
 There's nothing about today that, you know, it's not going to, this tournament is probably still going to be won with a couple under par. So it's not that damaging, no.   
  
  Q. How did you feel your putting went overall and what do you feel is wrong with it?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: As I said, I haven't holed anything during the round, so it was just not a good day on the greens.   
  
  Q. Do you plan to do anything now to prepare for tomorrow?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm just going to consider that now, when I head inside, and see what I probably will do. Probably hit a few drives, anyway.   
  
  Q. You got off to a really good start. It must have felt good after a couple holes.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah I was very comfortable early on. And to be honest it was very comfortable all the way through. I wouldn't say -- like from 8 through to all the way through to 16 and I had a lot of good birdie chances. And obviously weren't converting them.   
 Then I hit a poor shot on 16, a poor tee shot on 18, two bogeys. A poor one on 17 as well.   
 So it would have been nice, as I said, it would have felt a little bit better, as I said, making par at the last. I thought I chipped it in. And that's the nature of the game. As I said, probably want to to get my breaks on Sunday, not on Thursday.  
  
  Q. Well you haven't started terribly well in Masters before and you contended on Sunday, so that's something to take I suppose into the weekend, isn't it?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, I actually did start quite nicely today. Oddly I was struggling in the Open a couple of holes and I was not quite there and today I was, as I said, I got maybe a little bit frustrated a little bit later in the round.
