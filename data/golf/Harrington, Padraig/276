  Q. Story of the day is that it's two doubles.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I suppose it is.   
  
  Q. I don't think I've written two doubles on the back of your scorecard before.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I hope that doesn't happen too often.   
 I hit 7-iron pretty much down the pin on the 14th, came up short and it ran down to 35 yards down. Pitched it up on the green and it's going back into the bunker and then big bunker shot to about five feet and missed it.  
 Next hole I hit the tee shot right and got a bad lie and left it in and chipped it out and hit it to three feet and missed it. 3-putt might be the one.   
  
  Q. You played such good golf --  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Not really, no. I was running out of steam today is all it was.  
  
  Q. After America?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes. I lost a bit of confidence on the greens.   
  
  Q. But you don't want to miss the cut, though, do you.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No, definitely not. I always think tomorrow is going to be a great day. Never want to miss playing St. Andrews, anyway.   
 So it's moving rapidly the wrong direction.   
  
  Q. Two weeks off now before Portugal, or ten days off?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, week off.
