Q. Glad to be back? What did you make of the course today?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm delighted to be here, and the golf course is just in phenomenal condition, although I must say that it's a very, very tough course. My caddie and I were going through it and the fairways are narrower than the US Open, the rough is as heavy as the US Open and there are more dog-legs and more wind, so I think anyone who is a really good driver of the ball will do well here.
Q. You mentioned the US Open a couple of times -- does it remind you of that type of course?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, yes -- you've got to hit fairways. I've got a new Wilson driver in the bag, so hopefully I will drive the ball well because you're going to have to do that this week.
Q. Are you hitting the new driver well?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I am -- you don't put a new driver in the bag unless you hit it better than the old one and I think the new one carries and runs a little further so it's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Q. Do you feel capable of winning this week -- you came so close in 2001?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's a really tough track here, I've got to say. So, you are going to really have to be at the top of your game to win here. I thought that 22 under -- which won it in 2001 -- was unbelievable that year and I don't see that out there now, definitely not. You never know, it could all come together -- it's crucial that I drive and putt well.
Q. What do you make of the strength of the field this week?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's very strong -- I think the strongest for a regular European Tour event. Everybody loves coming here, it's a great event.
Q. Does Tiger's presence give players an extra edge?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm sure it does -- it's good to have him in the event and it brings some valuable world ranking points to the event.
Q. I take it one of your immediate goals is to get back into the top ten in the world?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Without a doubt. I'm only 0.01 behind tenth place at the moment so a good week this week could get me back in there.
