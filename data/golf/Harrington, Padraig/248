  Q. Going nicely at 3-under par, trouble on 17, just tell us from your point of view exactly what happened.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, it's a tough tee shot. It was an interesting one. I kind of didn't want to hit the driver. It was just about on in two, and you know, it's not my favourite hole, so I bailed out right, and I got stuck in the tree, really nowhere to go but back to the tee, which I didn't want to fancy going back there again.   
 So I chipped it forward into another tree, took a penalty drop. End of the day, wasn't too disappointed. Hit a lovely fifth shot, got a bit unlucky and should have got it up-and-down, I had a straightforward chip-and-run, and you know, I chipped it six feet and hit a good putt and missed.   
 So that's how I took eight, but yeah, disappointed with the chip and a bit unlucky with the put.  
  
  Q. Earlier in the day, were you struggling off the tee, as well.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Not that I remembered. I thought I played quite well.   
  
  Q. Just a few, middle part of the round, 3-wood into the bunker on 9, was it?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I hit a beautiful drive up the 9th, a little fade off the bunker, a sloping fairway, and I kicked up the hill, which was odd, with a driver. Yeah, I did hit a poor tee shot on 11.   
 And then I hit a lovely tee shots all the way in, 13, 15, 16, I was feeling pretty good, but as I said, it's a tough tee shot for me. Nobody stands at that tee shot, unless you're laying up off the tee, it's a tough shot and you're going to take it on.   
 I did hit a bad shot and I got punished for it.  
  
  Q. Now that you have a competitive round, what's your thoughts on it?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It couldn't have been better. Definitely the golf course, I feel it's easier. There's a lot more opportunities when you missed the greens to get up-and-down. The greens are much better, much more predictable, even if you short out, you feel like you can get up-and-down out there. The greens are firm and fast but they are there for scoring.  
  
  Q. You say you played nicely earlier in the round, was it a case of one bad hole and you are quite happy with your game with three days to go?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, I would not be thrilled with my game in terms of what it's going to be like the next three days, but I'm quite happy with my game going forward, yeah. You know, whenever I'm hitting a bad shot, just the cause of it is pretty evident, so I'm happy with that.   
 It's not something I can exactly put right in the next couple of days. I kind of have to work with it. As I say, I was quite happy all the way through. Most of the round, I hit a lot of decent shots and worked with it nicely. You know, I kind of have to stick with that and hope that the odd time I hit a bad shot, I don't get cut out.   
  
  Q. And your position in the tournament, level par at the moment, do you go away now, have your lunch or whatever and be positive about it the next three days? Do you feel that you can be positive about it?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Four shots behind is never too far after round one. If I'm going to be disappointed, I'm going to be disappointed that my putt didn't drop on 18 and my putt didn't drop on 17.   
 You know, they are two shots, looks like -- both of them look like they are going to get in on the high side of the hole ask both of them missed. I'm not going to be -- I'm not going to be a bit disappointed about a bad tee shot on 17. These things happen.   
 You know, you've got to get on with it, and as I said, I keep playing that way for the next three days, I'm not saying I'm going to be playing perfect, but if I can get away with the odd bad shot, that will do quite nicely.
