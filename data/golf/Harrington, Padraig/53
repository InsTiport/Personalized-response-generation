 Q.  Padraig, 2 under round today.  Talk a little bit about your day today.  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I felt I played well today, nice and solid.  I probably -- I look back I could have holed a few more putts, but I probably came out of the round neutral.  That's probably what I deserved.  Would have been nice to birdie the last.  If I birdied, I would have probably wanted to eagle it.  Such is the nature of the game.   
Probably played my best on Thursday and shot the worst score, which is interesting.  6-under is probably a good return on the week.  It's obviously not good enough.  If it hangs into top 10, it certainly pushes me up in the FedExCup playoffs, which is nice to know my schedule.  Happy about that.   
I get to sit and watch the golf this afternoon, hopefully blistery conditions (smiling).   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I haven't see seen the leaderboard.  I barely looked on 18 there.  I think Jimmy is leading.  Jason Day is second.  I won't -- I think Jimmy -- I would like to see Jimmy win.  Jason is a good guy too.  I'm comfortable with just about anybody up there winning.  I like to see the guy who plays the best win.   
 Q.  Rory posted on Friday (no microphone)?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: That's the magic question, isn't it?  Everybody would like to sort out their putting and putt better.  I would like to putt better.  It's a hard one.  In 2012, I was at a very low point in my putting and that's kind of has made me a much more tentative putter ever since.  Is it a question of practicing more?  Is it a questioning of practicing less and relaxing about it?  Who knows.  If I had the solution, I would be bottling it.   
 Q.  Do you think he needs help or is it something he can sort out himself?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Honestly, I have no idea.  I didn't he was putting badly.  I had no idea.  I couldn't tell you whatsoever.  I just have been clueless.   
 Q.  You gave yourself chances on the back nine (no microphone)?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Not necessarily, no.  I was comfortable with my putting today.  I got in the right place.  For the first eight holes, I could have -- every putt I hit could have gone in, ran by the hole three feet.  I was very aggressive.  I nearly holed a shot on one hole.  To only make two birdies in the first eight holes, I nearly made two chip-ins as well.  Probably hit one of the best shots in my life on the 6th hole.  I had plugged lie from 35 yards on a upslope of the bunker.  I went wedge and went after it which was nice.  I didn't back off.   
There was a lot of nice shots out there, a lot of nice playing.  There was a lot of nice putting.  I certainly was comfortable with my putting today.  As you saw there was two putts that came up short in the middle of the round, which would have been nice.  I hit them fine, I putted well.  I'd take putting like this every day.  I'd take playing like this every day.  I have no -- I'm not walking away from this with any -- I'm not second guessing anything.  I'm very comfortable with the way I played.  If I continue to play like this every day, there's good days ahead for me.   
 Q.  (No microphone) at the Ryder Cup?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm a little late in the game for that.  No, I don't see it happening.  I would love to tell you I would go win next week at Travelers, go win -- Rio and then -- well, I think I would be turning up in Denmark if that was the case.  It's an -- I'm not -- look, I'm just trying to play good golf and play well.  I'm happy in the role I'm in.  If I start winning things, maybe that changes.  At the moment it's not really on my radar.   
 Q.  Do you know what your duties are going to be?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I was vice captain last time.  I assume it's pretty similar.  I think Darren's picked a few vice captains who are opinionated.  He's going to be getting lots of strong opinions.  Nobody is going to be sitting on the bench with the guys he has.  I think he's a strong enough character as well to be able to handle that.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: So many things are better.  I'm happy with my swing, getting a lot better with my putting, getting a lot better with my mental side.  The only thing I'm not comfortable with which I kind of -- my short game, I wouldn't be.  Then when I look at the PGA Tour, I'm No. 1 in bunkers and No. 4 in strokes gained around the greens, but I don't see it so good.  Maybe that's just my own -- I need to change my attitude.  Everything else is good.  I feel good.  I would like to take this into every day I play the next number of years.  I'm going to take this attitude and I feel like I'm in a great place.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No, we talked about a lot of things, though.  I've got to say it was a very nice partnership to have with a lot of chats about life on Tour, sort of thing.  He's a young guy coming up with decisions to be made.  We were discussing -- I was trying to give him a little bit of my experience.  So it was a very pleasant play, I've got to say.  He's obviously playing well, playing nicely.  He didn't get the breaks over the two days, but his game is well in shape.  He's exactly the type of guy we want going into the Ryder Cup.
