  Q. Cut line became an issue for a while.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I played awfully well for the first ten holes. Probably couldn't hit it any better, and seemed to run out of a bit of steam after that. As I said, a lot of opportunities early on but did just the same when I was probably a little bit more erratic at the end there, the last eight holes. My game could do with a little bit of that, a bit more up-and-down wouldn't be too bad.   
  
  Q. This course looks as though it's offering a lot of birdies and it does look as though there's a score there to be had.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, as I said, the first ten holes, I probably had ten good birdie chances type thing.   
 Yeah, if you're holing the putts -- you still have to hole the putts out there and keep your eye on it sort of thing. The greens are good for that, and it's a good course for scoring.
