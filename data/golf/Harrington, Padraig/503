Q.  I asked the boys in the booth if they'd play a little chorus of "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling."  Your third shot at 18 had to bring a smile to your face.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, I got lucky there.  I didn't hit a good shot and it bounced forward and to the side, and it trickled down to three feet.  It was nice to get a break like that.  Sometimes you hit good shots and you don't get the breaks, so I'm going to take that very nicely.
Q.  Kind of a strange round for you; you weren't really comfortable out there.  You just mentioned you were fighting a hook all the way.  What can you do to rectify that?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I don't know.  I just have to continue to do what I did today and try and draw the ball; I'm hitting a hook.  To just try and cut every shot I play on the golf course is a little bit awkward because on 18 there I had a left to right sidehill lie in the fairway, and I can't miss the green right, so it's not the easiest shot to try and hit a cut.  So I tried to draw, and all of a sudden I hit that big hook.  I've got to put up with the fact I'm going to hit a few of those shots.
Q.  You just got one shot closer to Michael Campbell, who unfortunately missed his par putt for a 62.  He did shoot 63.  You even have to be impressed with that.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I think that ties my course record here.  I think I shot 63 here.  I'm pretty sure that's the course record, so he tied it.  He must be a good player (laughter).
