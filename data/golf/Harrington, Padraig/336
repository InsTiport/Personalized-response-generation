 Q. Nice finish? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Nice finish that way. Yeah, very nice to make two birdies at the end of your round, especially when you're trying to get to the clubhouse before the dark, so I was very happy about that. 

 Q. Overall, good position, too. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Not bad. You know, obviously four behind, there's a bit of work to be done there, but good weekend, still in it. 
 Certainly I would have taken it starting off the week. 

 Q. How much better than yesterday? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, I scored very well today. I definitely didn't play -- I didn't hit it very straight off the tee, so I made the most of it all the way around. Bar the 16th hole, maybe 15 and 16, I absolutely maxed out on every other hole of the day. I didn't leave much out there. 

 Q. You're in good position, too, coming into the weekend. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, as I said, I'm happy with where I'm at, and another two days and hopefully have another good 27 holes to leave myself in somewhat contention with nine to play and see what happens then.

 Q. You have that young curly-headed fellow ahead of you again?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Impressive performer. Good sign. I had not been watching the leaderboard, but I saw his name up there. 

 Q. Good to see it, isn't it?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, he's very, very good. Really doing the job. 

 Q. It was last year where he tapped you on the back and said he wanted to beat you. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: That's always got to be the goal, is to move up and catch the next guy ahead of and you keep working that way. He certainly looks like a -- well, he always looks like a fine player, but he's delivering. That's the important thing. There's been plenty of good players who have come out and haven't delivered, and he is delivering, so that's a good sign.

 Q. He's doing some good work with Paul Hurrion and starting to feel the results.
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: We all have to work on our weaknesses and he's happy to do that and that's a good sign that will stand him in good stead for the whole of his career, if he keeps doing good work.
