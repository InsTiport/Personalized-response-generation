Q.  A nice improvement.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yes, all around a good week for me.  At some stage here during the week, I did just about all the things right.  At some stage I didn't quite get it all together all the time, but I didn't drive it well the first three days, drove it much better today.

My putting on the card is what let me down all week.  I didn't putt well today, but the other three days I putted quite well, even though the stats weren't good.  They were dropping.

So yeah, I'm certainly a lot more upbeat about my game.
Q.  This is a repeat of Wentworth, isn't it, about what it could do?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, it could do a lot for him if he does win an event like this, give him the self confidence to go with his game, which he obviously has a very strong game, so that self confidence is exactly    even Wentworth helped him get up to the Top 50, now this will maybe help him get into the 20s.  He certainly is capable of more, so it's a question of hopefully    just get a break on the back nine, and he has a great chance.
Q.  Do you struggle for confidence?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It's not a confidence thing.  There's an unwritten thing like you just don't    you drop one extra putt and you think you're playing better golf.

You know, you get a break on the golf course, maybe that break is your ball doesn't have mud on it, doesn't finish in a divot, and all of a sudden you shoot a better score, and that could be the catalyst to think you're playing better, and then you do play better.  It kind of goes like that.

You often see that you go out there and you play your hardest and play your toughest and nothing is happening.  It's not that you don't need to go practice, but at times it's not going and beating balls that could be the difference, it could be just waiting, being patient for it to come round, showing confidence in yourself.  It's not confidence in your game, it's just confidence that if you do your thing that it will be good enough.  That's really what it is ultimately.
Q.  Do you move on straight to Germany?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Straight to Germany.

We golf Germany, then is it a week off or the Seve Trophy?  I didn't make the match play this year.
