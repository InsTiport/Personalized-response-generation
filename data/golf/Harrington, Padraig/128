  PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     You know, I should know at this stage what it's going to be like first week out, and tee‑to‑green, I was very ropey.   Hit a lot of bad shots.   I liked what I saw today.   There was definitely some improvement.   I could hit better shots today.   Found the middle of the clubface more often today, let's say.   That was a good sign.   I'm happy about that going forward.   But big plus this week is obviously I putted well.   I did a lot of work on putting over the winter. 

Q.   You did intimate at the start of the week that if there were two modest rounds to start and a good weekend that would be good?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Look, I didn't strike it great.   I'll be looking forward to seeing Pete tomorrow.   But I kind of figured out what I was doing wrong overnight. 
And I hit a few shots that I saw some good things, but obviously it's very hard‑‑ as you're standing over to hit a shot and you're thinking about your swing and then you go and try and hit a golf shot are two different things, so there's some shots out there that were some bad preparation on some shots but I did hit the ball in general more out of the middle of the clubface and at times actually felt quite good. 

Q.   We started the week talking being nostalgic, talking about 17 years ago.   Then you earned just over a hundred and now you have just over 100,000; not bad, good phone callback to mom?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Honest to God, the 1,480 pounds felt more, 100 per cent more.   It was just an awful lot of money.   It was the biggest cheque of my life at that stage.   So you know, yeah, biggest cheque of my life and had never held a job at that stage in his life.

Q.   If you don't want this‑‑
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   This is great.   This goes into my bank account.   But 1,480 pounds, it really hit home.   I'm not saying that there's nothing wrong with a 100,000 Euros, at all, but I'm just saying that goes into it.   It goes into a bank account but you don't really know much about it, whereas 1,480 pounds, it was colossal.   What could you buy with that?   Colossal. 
I think the biggest cheque I had ever received in my life before that, I won 300 quid as a voucher, which wasn't allowed to be cashed in as an amateur golfer.   And I think I had won 300 pounds in a boy links, like a Pro‑Am type event, also. 
It was big.   It was a big deal to me.   It's a bigger deal finishing fourth and the World Ranking points today, and that's what I was looking at on the last tee, I could see a big pile of guys on 11‑under, and I said, please, please, get out of this, because all last year, I tended to be the wrong side of the bubble. 
So I was thinking to myself, just birdie the last and pick up a few more points, and it's points I'm looking for.   So I'm looking at that much more so than the Euro value.   But I won't say no to it. 

Q.   And you'll see Pete as you say but a good foundation for 2013? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Absolutely.   I'm really confident, I'm pretty sure of what I'm doing wrong, so just try to get it corrected so that I'm comfortable with it on the course.   Again, as I said, it's great to have four days here and it will be a lot tougher next week.   I wish they were all like this week: Four rounds, 35 people starting at 12 o'clock in the day.
