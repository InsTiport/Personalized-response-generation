Q.   What happened on ‑
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Was hoping it was stuck in the bank but obviously it wasn't.   Didn't really even‑‑ wasn't even considering.   I had a lot of club, I was trying to hit it in there and just ballooned up into the wind.   I was surprised.   Yeah, moved left, right in a right‑to‑left wind, but there you go. 

Q.   Overall, pleased? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I played much better than my score.   Struggled on the greens.   Obviously got it together more on the last nine holes, which definitely a lot of missed opportunities out there.
