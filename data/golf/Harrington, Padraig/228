  Q. PÃ¡draig, 68-68 today, sum it up if you would?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I think it's hard to sum it up. You know, I suppose I had three 3-putts from very short range. You know, but at other times, a break on the par 5 third. Yeah, maybe it could have been a bit better, but it was, what -- I suppose, 68? It's hard, actually. I'm not 100 per cent sure. There's a lot of about birdie chances, as I said. It's tough when you make a bogey out there; and all of the three 3-putts came from very short range and I was thinking I was going to birdie the holes.  
 Yeah, at times I found the greens quick and that put me off a little bit. There's a lot of slope in them. I think the practise last week, the greens at home were a bit slower and I just found the greens a bit quick here.   
  
  Q. The short game was in shape today. The pitching was just absolutely marvellous. Were you happy with the way it was out there today? To me, I actually said on air today that you are as good as the great Seve Ballesteros; would you agree with me?   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I don't feel like that. But I hit a few nice -- I hit a nice bunker shot to save par on 13 which was very important. I made the chip on 17 look simple, which is always nice.   
 You know, if I putted well today, it would have been a tremendous score, and I'm happy going forward the next couple of days. I just wasn't quite -- I could see the two weeks of practise I had done out there. At times, I just got stalled over the ball a second or two longer than I wanted to.   
 You know, that's a sign of just I'm better off another three rounds of golf will do me no end of good.   
  
  Q. We have another golf layout here that's very exposed, much like Celtic Manor. Have you noticed that and do you feel like your wind game is in shape, or what about your wind and rain game?   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, certainly, this is a very typical European-style golf course, as Celtic Manor is, as well. I think we obviously didn't get any -- one or two showers today but the wind got up towards the end and certainly you've got to shape some shots and I think that's going to be a big play next week, assuming that there are going to be some crosswinds, and with the temperature that we are probably going to expect in October in Wales, those crosswinds are going to have a big effect on the golf ball.  
  
  Q. What score are you going to shoot tomorrow?   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: If I had played a full practise round on the second course, the Retz Course -- but I couldn't tell you exactly, I have no preconceived ideas what score I'm going to shoot. I went around, I think there's four par 5s in it and a drivable par 4 and one very tough par 3. You can get through certain holes, and I actually played the par 3s well today but if I play the par 3s well again tomorrow, it really does open it up for shooting a low number.  
  
  Q. If I give you 66 now; will you take it?   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes, 66 is always a good return. It doesn't matter what golf course you're on. If you shoot 66, you have to hole putts to shoot a low number. Yes there is scoring out there and the greens are soft and you can reach the par 5s, but, in the end of the day, you still have to hold the 10-footers and the 12-footers, so 66 would be a very nice return. I'm sure three more of them would leave me very close to winning this tournament.
