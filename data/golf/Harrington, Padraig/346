 Q. Bit of an anti-climax? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON : Yeah you know. What can I say. I started off with some really bad shots and struggled. Then I made a few birdies but it all fell apart. I missed a good chance on 11 and I never seemed to get anything back after that. It's hard to get away with it on a Sunday when you are not prepared right. 

 Q. The weather changed from yesterday?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON : I didn't want to see an easy day that's for sure. Iwasn't playing well enough or confident enough. I think I needed a tough day. I just wasn't prepared. I know myself I'm just not on the top of my game when you go out there 

 Q. Looking forward to a break?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON :I play twice in next two weeks then I will have a break.

 Q. Your going to have a battle on yours hands in Spain?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON : Yeah I will no matter what now that's for sure. It's on his hands if he wins today. Either way Robert will be under pressure and we will have a good match that's for sure.
