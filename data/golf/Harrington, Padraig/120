 Q.   Just wonder if you remembered your first shot at your first Masters?   
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   No.   I do remember my first experience at the Masters.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Coming down Magnolia Lane.   I had just won the day before in Brazil.   Walked to the clubhouse, I met the President of the Golf Union of Ireland.   He happened to be sitting in the garden at the table with Sam Snead.   I sit the first hour at Augusta with Sam Snead.  
   
 Q.   That was pretty nice.   
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I had never met him before, so‑‑  
   
 Q.   What year was that?   
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   2000.  
   
 Q.   2000.   So you just won Brazil the day before?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah.   It was 2000 or  99.   Might be  99.
