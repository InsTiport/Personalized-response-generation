  Q. Nice start to the week?   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: First rounds haven't been a problem this year.   
 Well, what can I say? First rounds haven't been the problem this year.   
  
  Q. Second rounds haven't been too bad, either.   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Haven't been too bad, either. Sometimes I haven't got to the second round.   
  
  Q. But as first rounds go, how does that one go?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I liked what I saw. Played -- scored nicely early on and played nicely coming home. So a good combination.  
  
  Q. Vast difference between the two courses you played last night and this morning.   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, quite a difference. Like we stopped on the fifth tee and at the time, the group before us was hitting driver and lob-wedge into it. Mind you, it wasn't that far for us, but certainly 7 was -- a few guys were hitting -- I hit a good 5-iron in there. Some guys were hitting -- I hit a good drive and a 5-iron in, and I'm sure a sand wedge. It swings in roundabouts; I hit 6-iron into 8 and a lot of guys would have been laying up there.   
 Yeah, so you have to take it as it comes. There are places you gain and places you lose. Some of the shots downwind are pretty tough. It's nice to be able to reach it in two. It wasn't an easy shot but it's better than hitting a 6-iron than laying up.   
  
  Q. Short game looked particularly sharp, as well. You got it up-and-down, yesterday, anyway.   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, a lot of those are putting from the fringe. You know, I was happy with my short game. I was happy, overall I want complain too much. Wouldn't complain about anything to be honest.  
  
  Q. Would you prefer for it to stay blustery like this?   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: It's wearing. It is wearing when it's blustery like this. But yeah, you have to think it suits my game. It doesn't look like too many other people are struggling in it. The scoring was going forward this morning even though it was windy. Like I said, whatever comes, I don't get a choice, so I don't think it would be a disadvantage to me if it stays that way, but it is a long week when it's windy like this.   
  
  Q. What do you do with a few hours now until your tee time? Do you go back to bed?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: No. I'll go and rest. I'll have some breakfast and rest is what I'll do.
