 Q.  Talk about the double bogey down the last. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I think it's a disappointing finish, yes, but not a finish -- it's easy to take six down the last, so it's not like -- it's not out of the blue.  So, yeah, I'm disappointed, but I don't think it will affect the outcome of my tournament this week.  I don't think it will have any affect.  What I did today won't really affect too much the rest of the week. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  You know, I missed a few chances on the way out.  Again, hitting an iron into 6 and not birdieing it.  So you know it's going to be a struggle from the back.  I hit a couple of bad drives on the back nine.  I hit a bad drive on 10 and dropped a shot.  I hit a poor drive -- well, I hit a poor drive on 15, but it went in the bunker, and hit a poor drive on the last.  It's easy to drop shots from the back.  I ended up with another 36 holes to play. 
 And as I said, it's not going to affect the outcome of this tournament, the 72 holes.  I don't want to be too far behind, obviously, after today.  But it just means I just go and play good golf for the weekend and that's it. 

 Q.  You really stuck in today.  When greens were missed you produced some of the most magical pieces of your short game, particularly on the up-and-down on the 8th over the bunker.  But also 11, 12 and 13.  What's been the key over the week so far? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I've been good.  I felt good around the greens.  It gives you an opportunity, obviously when you play links golf.  And I think that's the difference.  You can come up and hit the golf ball when we miss greens or in six inches of rough and it's a little bit of a lottery here.  It really does bring out the scale. 
 That chip I did on the 8th, I'd say that's probably the first time I've hit a chip shot like that in the first round.  There's nothing like being tested like that.  That's why we like to come back to these tournaments. 

 Q.  You started yesterday, and halfway if someone said to you level par, what would you have said about the overall picture of being in contention on Sunday? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Probably would have taken under par and hoped it snowed for two days.  As it stands at the moment I'd like to be level par.  But we don't get a choice in this matter.  I'll just play my own game for the next 36 holes, as I said.  There's a lot of golf left in this tournament.  Maybe I'll go out a little bit more aggressive now that I'm level par.  If I was 2-under par, maybe I'd be a bit defensive.  Who knows what sort of attitude.  But like I said, there's 36 holes of golf left and whether I'm 1-under par, 2-under par, level par really wouldn't make a difference to my chances on the weekend.  The outcome will be the same.
