Q.   How'd you hit them today? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm very pleased with the score.   I didn't hit it that well.   I got a good start and a few good shots early on then kind of settled in in the middle of the round but hit a few out of bounds.   Finishing the way I did the last few holes will make my lunch taste a lot better. 
I'm very happy with the score.   Looking forward to a good week.   I just keep feeling like I want to hit it better than I did today, but I did hole a few putts at the right time today.

Q.   What do you think the afternoon's going to be like? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Hopefully, windy.   It's normally windy in the afternoon here, but the scoring seems to be better.   This morning it was ideal weather for golf.   As I said, I made six birdies today, which is as many as I made in all of last week.   It's nice to be a little bit freer, more open.   In terms of being relaxed and enjoying it, this is a much nicer week.   I won't say easier, but much nicer. 

Q.   What are you looking at specifically with your game on this course? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I know in the past when the golf course gets warm here, it starts to firm up.   You can get off the tee a long way and things tend to get tight, so you've got to be very accurate, and you've got to make birdies.   You've got some holes coming home that will put you under pressure.   Even if you're leading the tournament, you're going to have to make some birdies coming down the stretch.   You want to be hitting your wedges well on these incoming holes. 
There are a lot of Irish people in these parts, so I always enjoy the crowd turnout that comes to cheer for me.   It's a big advantage of being Irish.   You get Irish fans all over the world. 

Q.   How quick are these greens going to get? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   The greens are perfect at the moment, nice pace, certainly wasn't running away from us.   You have to suspect as it dries out, the golf course is going to get faster, and the greens are going to get quicker.
