Q.   Great round.   Are you happy with the way you played today?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I played okay today, yeah.   I suppose I would be happy like ‑‑ no, not really. 
(Laughter.)
Obviously I had a great chance coming down the last and I felt good over it, felt I needed to make a birdie for sure.   So I'm not too disappointed about making a bogey, but at least I'm not at the momentum. 
If 2‑over makes the playoff, I'll be dying.   But at the momentum I think it's going to be better than 2‑over.   So it was a good day all around.   I missed a few chances, got a few chances.   When I look back through the week I'm probably going to be three shots, four shots short, by the looks of it. 
I could have certainly found those four shots throughout the week and that's a nice place to be, to know that ‑‑ when I played here in'98, I finished 27th and I maxed out every bit of ounce of talent I had in me to finish 27th. 
This time around I tied sixth and I feel like I could have easily been a number of shots better.   So it's nice to feel comfortable in those sort of situations.

Q.   Can you talk about making up those few shots though and how difficult it is on this course? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I never found the course difficult all week.   I thought the course was brilliant.   You hit a good shot, especially if you hit it down the fairway, the golf course you were left with wedges into the greens. 
I did find the toughest part probably was and maybe I‑‑ this is why I might have found it difficult, you had a lot of side slopes and it was hard hitting your pitching wedges and sand wedges.   You were moving them 10 yards left‑to‑right in the air.   It was like playing with clubs that were a couple of degrees flat or something like that, with the side slopes. 
And that caught me out on 18 because I hit a lot of shots up on 18 and I was trying hard not to hit it right and I succeeded very well, actually. 
But I thought the golf course was just a phenomenal setup.   Just I wish we could ‑‑ well we can't play golf on a golf course like this every week, but it was a joy to play.   It was testing all the way through, but very fair.   I don't think there was a hole out there that you couldn't maybe hit two good shots and think that you weren't going to make birdie only.   And that's a great sign when every hole gives you the opportunity if you play it well to make birdie. 
And if you slip up, and if you did slip up it wasn't like it was impossible to make a par either.   If you got it back in play, you could get your self a reasonable chance of getting up‑and‑down.   So it was a nice golf course this week.   And maybe that's why I'm a little bit disappointed at 3‑over par, I don't feel like ‑‑ I don't feel like the course beat me up this week.   I feel like I left a few out there. 

Q.   Can you talk about the chip down in, and did you think maybe this is my day when you saw it?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   You got to have that attitude from the first hole.   So it doesn't matter whether you make bogeys or birdies here.   In your head you're running a little thing that you're going to win, full stop.   So you try not to get too high when you chip in like than you try not to get too low if you make a bogey.   You just take it as part of the whole process. 
So it was nice to chip in, that's for sure; and certainly I started looking at the leaderboards after that just to see how much I needed to chase.   And it's tough, 16 is a tough tee shot for me.   You got to really hook it off the tee nearly 40, 50 yards of a hook.   And I don't play with a draw at all. 
So it was a tough tee shot.   But there's chances there, that's why I don't think with the number of guys coming home I think somebody's going to be able to get through those last couple of holes in 1 or 2‑under par.   So you got to think that's 1‑under or level par is going to be the winning score.   I was hoping to hole my wedge on the last, but not to be. 

Q.   So would you say that this was as fair a U.S. Open?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   They have been so fair for the last number of years.   It was just a fantastic setup.   I can't tell you it was any fairer than the one before this.   It was just a good setup. 

Q.   When you look back is it going to be the 4‑putt?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, I 4‑putted twice the first day, which was‑‑ I certainly left three shots in those four putts out there and I had another 3‑putt on top of that. 
So there's four shots easily the first day.   I had a bad day on the greens the first day, not a great day on day three on the greens.   I look back, it wasn't my ability to play golf this week that was costing me, it's a couple of decisions here and there.   So it's kind of nice to think you have the ability to win it.   But maybe you just have to make the right decisions at the right time.
