   PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I lost it on the fifth hole. I missed a putt there and made a terrible five there from the middle of the fairway when he was in trouble.. To go bogey, bogey there and let him go one up when I could have been one up. When I look back everything after that was a bit of a struggle. I had a few putts here and there but that was a momentum shift there. You can't give away two holes like that especially at the time. Momentum would have been going my way if I had made the simplest of fours there. That's the nature of these matches and you have to take your opportunities. I made it tough for myself right there. I had a chance at the last but the damage was done on that fifth hole.
 It is tough in match play. I would like to play more golf as I think my game is right there but I didn't give myself the chances today and I was not as sharp as I could have been. But that one spot was where it all went away.
