Q.   You ve won here twice, would be nice to make it a hat-trick of victories this week?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Absolutely, I ve won both the individual and the team event twice, so it d be nice to get another win on the board. And obviously these golf coursesdo suit me ‑‑ hopefully things will click into place this week.

Q. You re an avowed lover of links golf, how do the three courses here compare? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: They re all different. St Andrews is obviously the Home of Golf, so that s the one the guys all really look forward to playing. But the other two are both beautiful courses in their own right. Depending on the conditions, the wind and the day, it can be tough and usually we have a few chances early on the week, and Sunday pin positions will be a bit tighter.   Carnoustie is always a very tough golf course. It's a golf course you've got to respect.   You're always trying to post a solid score and not lose your tournament out there. 
Kingsbarns is a joy to play, and given the right conditions, it is probably the easiest.   I think at times you can get an awkward wind that will take the par 5s out of reach, but once the par 5s are in reach, you can make some nice birdies. So that s the course you want to take advantage of if you can. 

Q.   You ve just played nine holes, what sort of shape is your game in?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I've been happy with my game all year, and it hasn't done me any good.   But I m not happy with it now; so we ll see if my results can improve. I ve talked in the past about getting the fear back, because that s when I ve tended to play my best golf, and that may have happened.   

Q.   You re playing with your great friend JP McManus again, is he excited about the week ahead? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   He most certainly is. You know, it would be nice to try to get another one, so we look forward to it.   It's good for me and keeps me competitive during the week; if I'm not doing well in the individual tournament, I'm obviously focusing on the team event and trying to get us up there.   Certainly helps you keep a good mindset all the way through the tournament.
