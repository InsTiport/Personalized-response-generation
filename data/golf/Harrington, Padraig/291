 Q. Great back nine. Did you think it would be enough at the end? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I was never sure. I was pushing as hard as I could. Again, maybe when I didn't birdie 17, I hit a nice shot into 17, I wasn't thinking it was going to be my day. I holed the putt on 18, you never know. 
 
 Q. How do you think the course played against a lot of great players? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: The course is fantastic. It really is. It's an intimidating test. It's exactly where we need to be. We got to be pushed to the limits. You are out there. 
 I'm sure if it would have been dry all week, it would have been great. Hard, fast, probably played unbelievable. 

 Q. You played great for the last month or so?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's only two tournaments. I think first six months, that was frustrating. I'm happy enough to be pushing along. I know wins will come along. If I don't win this week, maybe next week. That's the way it is. 
 It's nice to be in contention. It's nice to play better as I got more in contention. That's always a good sign. My focus is better, I hit the ball better. Coming down the stretch, that's exactly where I want to be.
