Q.  (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It was a disappointing day.  I
played quite nicely on the way out and didn't make enough going
from in there.  And obviously struggled with my finish, there,
which is disappointing.  And obviously dropped four shots in the
last five holes is never much fun.
Q.  Do you feel that 6-over is not going to make the cut or
might have a chance?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It certainly has a chance.  Five
would have been okay, I think.  6 is going to have to sit here all
day and wait to the last man sort of thing.
The conditions were a lot easier today.  I don't know if
the course is playing easier, but the greens are obviously a lot
slower, and holding a lot more.  And it wasn't as fiery.  I don't
know what that means for this afternoon.  Obviously there wasn't
much wind this morning, so who knows what this afternoon is going
to have.
Q.  You had a reasonably good start.  And the back nine
catching you to some degree.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, yesterday, as I said, probably
the first game of golf I've ever played in -- probably in my
entire life that I didn't have one single putt.  So I played great
yesterday.
Today was disappointing, maybe.  I just didn't make the
right choices at times, really, to be honest, after playing well
yesterday.  And it's a pity.
Q.  What happened?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It happens, you know.  I was feeling
pretty good about 15.  I went to the flag, had a lovely shot down
the left-hand side of the pin and it actually kicked left and
finished just off the left evening.  If it kicks right, it's
close.  I didn't hit a good chip.  The next hole I just misjudged
my second shot.  I was trying to hit a little wedge and I hit it a
little hard.  It went over the green.
16 I hit a nice 5-iron into the middle of the green.  Had
myself a very difficult first putt, and I left it 8 feet short,
missed that.  So it was a bad time for -- it was a really nasty
putt.  It must have had 15 foot of break on it.  It was more
uphill than I thought before it went downhill and it didn't hit
it.  That was disappointing.
Then on 18 I had about a 10-footer there on the last for
par, which would have put a smile on my face.  But unfortunately
not.  I'm going to have to have a long day.  Hope the wind gets
up, and hopefully the greens get as fast as they did yesterday.
Q.  Did you have to adjust to the slowness?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I wasn't caught off-foot in any way,
shape or form.  I hit a few putts before I went out.  It was
exactly what I expect coming into it from last night.  It was
expected going out there, there was no surprise yesterday, no
surprise today.
