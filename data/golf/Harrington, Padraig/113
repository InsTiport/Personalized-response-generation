Q.   Didn't have too bad a day, but the U.S. Open coming up next week.   How will this prepare you for that?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Certainly tough.   That's why I come to the tournament the week before the U.S. Open.   I want to test my game under a bit of stress, and certainly the stress at 18 holes, the wind made it very tricky.   The greens are fast.   In that sense it was a very good preparation for me.

Q.   You leave with a good taste or bad taste?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I did what I needed to do this week for next week.   I would like to do better this week in items of getting myself in a position that I was stressing a little bit about where I was hitting the golf ball.   It's the sort of feels like you want when you're going into -- you got to get used to those feelings, and whereas it didn't go as well as I would have liked today, I still -- it was a tough day and a grind out there and it's going to be a grind next week.

Q.   Work it out here instead of there?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yes.

Q.   What's it like playing in a tournament like this knowing it's going to benefit the children of St. Jude?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   That's great.   We're definitely overpaid professional golfers, professional athletes.   We earn so much.   And it's nice that we can come here, and, to be honest, everybody else does the work.   The volunteers do the work. 
And it's nice that we can come here and, you know, feel like we're giving something back.   And we obviously get a lot from this game.   So it's nice that we can give something back and that's mainly down to the volunteers.   At least we all go away with a good feel good fact for this week.
