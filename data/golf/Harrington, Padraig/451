   PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Tough golf course, going out there and facing obviously windy conditions, it was not really sort of thinking -- you're thinking anything around par is going to be good.  
Shooting 68, 2-under par, I'm very pleased with that. 

 Q.  Kind of swirling, too.  I imagine it's tough to figure out where and when it was coming. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, there's a little bit of that.  Obviously when you're doing okay, you don't see as much gusting in the wind. 
 The thing today was trying to pick the right shot whether you're going to hold it up left or go with the wind, two or three clubs different on a lot of shots; so it was really was committing. 
 A couple of those par 5s, par 3s over the water, they are very, very dangerous today.  A lot of hazards very close.  The bunkers are very soft, so you don't want to go in there, you have to cloak your eyes.  It's a difficult golf course.  2-under par is very pleasing.  You know, take another three of those. 

 Q.  I get the feeling you like the challenge. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, I think it is a golf course I would like to play every day.  Maybe not always with a stroke score, card in my hand, but it's a course the more often you play it, the better you'll be as a golfer.
