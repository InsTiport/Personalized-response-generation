   PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Michael Hoey seems to be running away with it, but pleased with that. My low score of the year, never a bad thing.

 Q. Does that mean you're gearing up for a fast finish? 
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I hope so. Feel good about my game. I holed a few putts today and didn't do that the first two rounds and hopefully I'll do that tomorrow and the next couple of months, as well.

 Q. How aggressive do you need to be?
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: If the weather is good, you have to be aggressive. Obviously the pins will be a little tougher tomorrow. But still, you've got to take your chances, if it's a good day, you're going to think you need to shoot 67 to stay in position and if you're going to catch Michael, you're going to have to go 64 again at least. 
 Michael, he's a good winner. He's good from the front. It's taken him a while to get comfortable on the Tour. He's always been a very talented player and this could be his arrival tomorrow. This is a step up for him. He's won plenty of tournaments. He knows how to win, but this will be showing he's arrived.
