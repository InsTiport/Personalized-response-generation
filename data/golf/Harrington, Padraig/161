Q.   (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   No, I'm not happy. 

Q.   What did you think of the course?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   The course is super.   Brilliant.   Actually, not difficult either.   It's nicely setup.   Very playable.   Yeah.   It was.

Q.   More playable than you expected?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   No.   No.   It's just playable.   It's very nice.   Nice setup.   It's ideal.   It just goes to show what the firm greens scare the life out of professional golfers.   So it's excellent. 

Q.   Where were your struggles today?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I had two 4‑putts and a 3‑putt, two stubbed chips from the edge of the green.   That's a lot of shots.   I don't think, I can't remember ever having a 4‑putt and I had two of them today. 

Q.   Was that down to you or the greens?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Oh, me.   Me.   Well, one of them I was out of position on.   The other one was just purely me.   I putted poorly all day.   So didn't do myself any favors. 

Q.   What was the hardest hole or green was there any green or hole that was harder than any other?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I honestly didn't see anything out there that was ‑‑ 3 was a bit awkward to hit the fairway.   No, 5.   5.   That was probably, that was an awkward tee shot.   Because it played a bit short. 
So, but other than that I saw nothing today that was ‑‑ 16 is an awkward tee shot as well.   Just because unless you hit a, unless you can draw it comfortably it's a bit of a struggle.   So probably 16 and ‑‑ really I thought the golf course didn't play hard at all.   It was, it played he very nicely. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   No, that's because it's a U.S. Open and guys are a little bit ‑‑ the course was lovely.   There would be no reason why scoring shouldn't have been better. 

Q.   Any positives to take from the day?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   No, I need an afternoon of putting. 

Q.   Do you think it will change at all between today and tomorrow?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Oh, I don't think so, they got what they wanted.
