  PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     The last two holes played back into the wind. 

Q.   How much are you looking forward to the next two rounds? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm looking forward to it.   It's nice to be in contention.   I'm very positive about my game coming in here this week.   I don't know what's going to happen the next 36 holes but I have a good idea where I'm going.   I'm pretty confident. 

Q.   Last week at Riviera you probably turned a corner, this has to be a continuation of that good play, don't you think?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, certainly for the first 27 holes I was really feeling very positive about my game.   I struggled coming home.   That was disappointing.   I suppose it's only to be expected.   You can't get everything going your way. 
So, you know, disappointed, as I said, about my finish, but I'm in a good place going through to the weekend, and feel like I have to play better than I played my first 27 holes.   Who knows, keep your head on and get up‑and‑down when you need to, be a tough weekend no matter what. 

Q.   Your putting has been really good here at this course, and that's come around too, I guess. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   You know, it has done.   I struggled with my putting a lot there for a few years.   The last six months, I found something that's given me some peace on the greens.   Trying to bring that into my long game. 
As I said, it was there for a while and maybe wasn't there for the last nine holes, but that doesn't mean it won't be there for the next 36.

Q.   How challenging are the conditions now, always changing? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, there's some tough holes in there and the rough has to get a little bit wet, I hit it in the rough on the last two holes, which are pretty innocuous holes and neither of them I could get it to the green.   Yeah, it's getting a little tougher. 

Q.   What was it like out there?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I was really happy with my game.   Came back this morning and it was great again.   When I turned for home, I struggled a little bit, a few of the old shots came back in.   I wouldn't say I'm‑‑ through 27 holes I was the most confident guy in the world, and less so at the moment.   I know it's going to be a long weekend and a tough weekend.   
Doesn't matter how well you play.   You're going to have to get up‑and‑down there and work your way through it.   Very positive with the position I'm in.   I have a few options.   I can play well on the weekend or I can dig deep and hang in there.

Q.   What have you found here this week to have the success you've had so far? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It's hard to say.   As you get older, you lose your innocence and you have to remind yourself of a few things when you're out there.   At times, how would I put it, I'm going to give you the clichÃ©:   At times I get lost and get distracted from the process.   Ultimately, that's really what's changed. 
I found a nice place where I was thinking of the process and it worked.   I hate to use that word as a clichÃ©.   I would love to give you another answer, but realistically, that is what it is.   But clearly I struggled with that the last couple of holes.   Struggled badly with it, so it's not like it's an easy thing to do.   But for a while, I was finding it pretty good. 

Q.   Looks like you're putting nicely?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Been putting well for a long time, six months, anyway. 

Q.   Nice for them to mean something. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, you know, as I said, I turned the corner with my putting maybe last August, and in many ways, I've been trying to figure out how to use that to get into my long game.   Did seem to find it Saturday afternoon last week and I felt a lot better about things. 
I had it for a long time this week and I definitely lost it coming home there.   So the positive is that I know what I want to do and I know what I want to try and do.   The negative is sometimes I fail to do it. 

Q.   Is it fun to be in this position or is golf always fun?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm fascinated with the game, I love it.   It's a different sort of fun, yeah.   Obviously I want to be at the top of the leaderboard and I want to be trying to win tournaments.   Five tournaments ago, I won, so it's not like it's an alien feeling for me. 
But, yeah, it's a good place to be.   I think I can‑‑ I think I'm in a good place that I can deliver more performances like this.   So I'm not panicked about going out and it all having to happen this weekend. 
I feel like there's good days ahead, so, you know, I'm not thinking, oh, I've got to do it and it will be a long time before it comes around again.   I feel I'm in a good place with my game and I feel I give myself plenty of opportunities like this going forward.   As much as I would love to take it, I'm not panicking over it. 

Q.   What were you working on on the range with the wedge‑‑
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It's kind of‑‑ if I hit a bad shot, my right shoulder stops.   So it stops because of the mental error but it stops all the same. 
So when I do more‑‑ it doesn't stop.   So I'm trying to correct a mental error with a physical thing‑‑ it just means that‑‑ if I could swing it like Happy Gilmore, I'd be very happy.   It's technically much better for me.   That's all I was just trying to get something into my swing with the least amount of mental effort. 

Q.   Does the struggle that you mentioned a minute ago on your final nine, was there a shot that triggered that?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   No.   You know, I hit a hideous shot on the third hole, which didn't help things.   But no, not really.   I can't say.   You know, just hit a few ropey once.   It's not even the result at times.   It's where my head was at, you know, so far too much into the outcome.   I know it's a clichÃ©.   It's a terrible clichÃ©, but I wasn't going through the process.

Q.   Can you come up with a better clichÃ©? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I can't (laughter).
