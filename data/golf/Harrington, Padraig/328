  Q. What was the story today?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I haven't really thought about it. I didn't drive it very well again but I had a lot of chances for birdie in the middle of the round. I'm not really sure what to think and that's a good sign, it means I wasn't getting into it too much on the course. I just need to drive it a bit better.  
  
  Q. The greens look to be turning brown - are they playing much more difficult?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You would have thought so but as I said there are still lots of opportunities out there, I had plenty of chances. I certainly had reasonable chances to shoot say 68.  
  
  Q. One of the reasons you came here was to get some rounds under your belt before the Masters, are you getting out of it what you hoped?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes, I am definitely getting out of it what I hoped. It is as expected.  
  
  Q. Presumably there are a lot of distractions for you though, with everybody asking you about the Masters and stuff?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes, but that has been there for seven months now. There is a lot of distraction but it is a nice distraction to have. I'd rather be asked about it than not having won the last two Majors so it is a good thing in many ways and I have to deal with it. But it is something I have to get out of my mind when it comes to the actual tournament and try to play it down a little bit and that is what I am doing.
