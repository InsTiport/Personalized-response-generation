 Q. You just walked off the golf course 4-under par after the first round. How would you assess your round?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, that's okay. I didn't play very well out there to be honest. My focus wasn't great, and I didn't hit it well off the tee. But I got it close on the greens, I holed a few putts and ran a lot of putts close, as well. Finished up, last couple holes started to play a bit better.

 Q. Tell us about how the golf course is playing today. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's perfect conditions, it's long, very little wind, so the ball is traveling. It's ideal for golf.

 Q. I heard a lot of people cheering for you out there. Some clearly are from Ireland and some speaking in native Irish tongue. A lot of support here in metro Boston?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Absolutely. There are a lot of Irish people. There's 5 million in Ireland and 40 million in the States, and I think most of them live in Boston. 

 Q. You scrambled, especially off the tee. Can you talk about that?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Off the tee I got myself in trouble, but I hit most greens. I had birdie putts on most holes, even though I had been out of position off the tee. I played a little bit better towards the end, which is nice. But it's always more important to hole the putts. I holed a few putts to keep me in there early on and finished up better. 
 Funny, I scored my worst over the last couple of holes, but I probably played my worst golf.

 Q. Are you talking about the 55-footer?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, no, the last couple, I three-putted on 6, hit a beautiful second shot and I had trouble on the par-5, hit a nice tee shot and then I hit a beautiful second shot into 18, my 9th, and had a difficult two-putt. The finish was better than the rest of it in terms of how I played. But I scored well all day, which is very important, bar the one three-putt. 

 Q. Well, you had the eagle in there. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, the eagle was great. Funny enough, the tee shot I was a little bit worried about running out and probably didn't commit to it and kind of hit it short left and hit 5-wood up to the green and had a long putt. It looked like it was going to be safe for the birdie, but it was nice to roll it in for eagle.

 Q. Can you talk about the opening drive?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I hit a little draw off the tee, I pulled it a little bit and it pitched in the side of the fairway, kind of ran through the fairway, through the rough into the hazard. If you're going to be aggressive off the tee, you can't hit it in the hazard. So be it. It was nice to make a par on that hole.

 Q. Do you really enjoy playing here? It's obviously a much different field. 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, obviously I haven't performed well here in the past, so I'm happy enough with my score today in that sense.
