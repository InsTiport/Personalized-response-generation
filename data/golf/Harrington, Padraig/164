  PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     A bit of overeagerness, maybe overconfidence, I don't know.   Certainly wasn't a great start.   Obviously put you on the back foot. 

Q.   When is the last time you left three in a bunker‑‑
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I don't think I ever did.   I don't think I ever did.   I was confident I was going to get it up‑and‑down and confident off the tee, as well. 
As I said, it was a bit of overeagerness early on in the round; maybe I should have been more patient.

Q.   Did the course itself live up to your expectations after you said you were coming back here a lot happier with it?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I think it lived up to my expectations, yes. 

Q.   Greens okay? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Exactly as I expected. 

Q.   What were you hitting off the tee there at 2? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   9‑iron.   It's a pretty straightforward shot.   Just didn't quite get it. 

Q.   Just a yard or two, isn't it? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, but as I said, you kind of know that when you're hitting at it.   Just didn't quite get it.   I think it was an easy enough pin.   I think I would normally go at a pin like that, maybe in hindsight, maybe it's the second hole of the day, maybe I should have been playing safer, who knows, but I'd like to now. 

Q.   Does that make you feel more cautious about where you're hitting shots following that?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I think I didn't get into a rhythm very often in the round.   At times, I hit good shots at times, but I was aiming maybe too safe after that.   You would be amazed how that has a knock‑on effect, definitely.   Just seems to put you behind the 8‑ball straightaway. 

Q.   What was the initial lie like? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It was good enough that I thought I could get it up‑and‑down.   If it was a bad lie‑‑ the last one was in one of my divots, so I got that one out.   That's what I was trying to do.   The first two, I was trying to get them up‑and‑down.
