Q.  Disappointing finish?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Nice drive down the fairway, hit a 3 iron, my hybrid to 12 feet and holed the putt.
Q.  (Was putting the difference?)
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Well, no, but I just missed    for birdie, 20 feet for eagle so wasn't exactly feeling confident.  It was nice to hole the putt.
Q.  First tournament as European No. 1?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It's been very, very good.  Today excellent all the way through.  Yesterday could have been a little bit better.
Q.  Any distractions out there?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Not really.  I was pretty focused all week.  Wasn't finding any distractions.  I look forward to when they get the greens a little bit firmer, that would suit me more.  It would be nice to have them where you could get a little bit more grip on firmer greens.
Q.  Where are you off to now?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Dunlop Phoenix.
Q.  Where Tiger's defending?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yes.  Nice to see somewhere different.  I hear the course is very good.

Then Sun City, Barbados and Tiger.  Tough schedule.  (Laughing).
