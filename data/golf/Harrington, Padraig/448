 Q.  About his roller coaster day and if he had fun. 

 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I did.  I walked away from this tournament knowing that I'm capable of winning at the Masters. 

 I hit my best shot at number 15.  I hit a good drive and a great second shot, but it ended up in the water.  Often times that goes your way.  To hit such a good shot, I never contemplated it would be in the water.  In fact, I was telling it to get down.  I thought it might be long.  Only when I heard the oohs and ahhs did I know it was in the water. 

 I was really happy with how I played.  Even when things went against me. 

 Q.  Did you feel you still had a chance? 

 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I felt great all day.  When I got to the 12th, I could see I was still in it.  From that point on I went after every pin.  The only pity was I hit a good shot on 15 and it didn't work out. 

 I'm comfortable in this position... this is just fantastic.  You can't beat playing in these tournaments. 

 Q.  (Asked about Tiger having the lead and then giving it up).  Does that make Tiger less intimidating? 

 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I'm intimidated enough about myself.  I don't need to worry about other people.
