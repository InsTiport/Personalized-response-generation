 Q. Playing on a golf course like this when it's windy like today, is it possible to put your foot on the accelerator?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, obviously you've got to make birdies even though it's a tough golf course here, expecting that somebody is going to play well. Even though the finish is difficult, somebody is going to keep going there. You have to make birdies at the end. This is the way it is; you've got to take chances.

 Q. You said you are happy?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: You know, I'm happy because the traditional weaknesses in my game were strong today. Some of my strengths, I didn't hole the putts, do things like that, mental error here and there, and some other parts were great, and I felt comfortable out here.

 Q. Rory McIlroy, you've seen him over in Europe. What does it mean to European golf to see him get a win in the United States at a place with a field like this?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I think it means a lot for him. We can talk about European golf afterwards, but it's a big deal for him to come over here and start winning over here. He wasn't contending, wasn't winning, and if he can get across the line it makes it a lot easier for him going forward, and I think it could make a big difference to his career. It's a lot of pressure on him, a lot of focus on the home, and it's putting him under enormous pressure to deliver, and obviously every week that he doesn't deliver, it's getting on him. But you know, if he can win here, it eases it all off.
