  Q. Eight birdies and throw bogeys in your round today, give us your thoughts on that one.   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I struggled to stay patient. You know, conditions were ideal obviously and yeah, I made three bogeys where birdie holes, three of them. I was in good position to make birdies and it was hard to stay patient there. You felt like you should birdie every hole, and certainly cost me a few, those bogeys.  
  
  Q. Bogeys were mostly from the putter, you missed a couple of short-ish putts but swinging well, I thought.   
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I was in good positions but both times, I hit two pitches on the ones that you would have seen, one I thought was okay, was a little long and hit the exact same pitch and next hole I came up short so both times I'm sort of 20 feet from the hole and I should have been just getting down in two and getting out of there. One I'm trying to chip it in from the fringe and the next one I'm trying to putt over a hill. Silly things.  
  
  Q. You've won championships where level par wins and this is going to be 20-under plus; what do you enjoy more?  
 PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I think the 20-under plus puts you under a lot of pressure. Certainly if I was not thinking 20-under I would have shot better than I did today. I was just pushing too hard.   
 It's easier when you feel level par -- or anything up to 8-under par you feel like you're always in the tournament and you're just hanging on, you're not making mistakes in those situations. Out there today, you're going gung-ho at everything and cost me a few shots.
