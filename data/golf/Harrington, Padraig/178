PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:       Obviously feels like a disappointing day at this very moment.   But I probably would have taken it going out.   So, there you go. 

Q.   A lot of good birdies out there. 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     Yeah, it was a very comfortable 6‑under par for 17 holes, I can tell you that.   It was very comfortable.   It was far from comfortable 7 there on the last. 

Q.   Awkward tee shot? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     It's a nasty tee shot, up a hill, left‑to‑right wind, trouble right, trouble left.   You know, if it was anything but a par 5, you would never, you know‑‑ yeah.   It's just a tough hole.   It's a good hole.   You get your tee shot right, you've got a great birdie chance, and if you don't, such is life. 

Q.   Tee shot there, was that what you were talking about, what you were talking on when you know what's going on?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:     That was a mental error.   I had not lost any drive all day.   So just wasafraid of hitting through the fairway like Ernie up the left; doesn't take much.   You know, where you're aiming, it's like a pretty decent‑‑ like Ernie hit a pretty decent drive into the heavy rough.   So it doesn't take much.   I was just afraid of doing the same thing in a left‑to‑right wind.   Mental error.   Came out of it.   Such is life.
