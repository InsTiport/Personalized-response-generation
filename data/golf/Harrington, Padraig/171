Q.   61 yesterday, completely different day today.   Tell me about what you felt here, especially after you got off to a good start there on 11?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm happy with my game but when you shot a good score, it's hard to match the next day.   When you're leading the tournament, it's hard not to be a little bit cautious and I think at times I was on the greens.   I struggled to get the ball up to the hole a lot today.   You know, it was what it was.   I certainly freed up on my back nine.   I felt I had some birdie chances.   Disappointed to 3‑putt the 6th and 7th.   You know, I would actually say, my mother cursed at me for missing the tap‑in on 6.   She wouldn't be so impressed with me not going through my routine on that.   
But, you know, these things happen.   It's disappointing as I said to make a couple of bogeys there.   It would have been okay if I got to that clubhouse and certainly shooting 70 or so.   But I'm glad it's not Sunday.   I know I have to putt a little bit better on Sunday and I have to be‑‑ you've got to have a little bit more flow if you're going to win tournaments.   I didn't do that much damage today. 

Q.   What will you need to do better?   Will it just be a matter of putting or anything else you're working on? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Oh, I would say just putting.   Yeah, just putting.   My shot selection was fine.   Trusting it a little bit more at times.   I felt a little better on my back nine today. 
Yeah, I realize that after shooting 61, I could obviously keep playing well and go on and win the tournament by going away from everybody.   But the more likely thing is you're going to hang in there and be around there come Sunday afternoon with nine holes to play; you'll be there or thereabouts and probably come down to who plays the best back nine on Sunday. 

Q.   Would you say the putts on 1, 2 and 3‑‑
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I suppose I didn't hit the ball close enough, either.   I didn't have a lot of 15‑footers where you're not worried about pace, you're not worried about missing them.   You know, you're just rolling them down there and that kind of frees up your stroke.   I tended to either have short putts or long putts today and I was definitely tentative on the long putts, and you know, inevitably you're a bit tentative on the short putts. 
It's nice when you play good golf and you keep hitting in there to 15 feet and pace isn't a big issue.   I didn't do that today. 

Q.   Back on 6 with Slugger, did you not‑‑ what did you do? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I marked it but I marked it but I missed it, more than two feet, which is pretty short on these greens.   I was surprised I missed it but there you go.   I didn't go through my routine on it but I still marked it and put it down and read it and did that.   Just one of those things.   I'm not going to make too much about it. 

Q.   And the next one?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Well, I hit a bad first putt on next one.   Hit an okay second putt.   It wasn't the place I wanted to be and the next one I would have liked to have had a 15‑footer or shorter where I wasn't struggling to 2‑putt.   That's what happens in golf, doesn't it. 

Q.   When you talk about either going away from the field or being in there the rest of the week, at what point did you realize it was going to be the latter? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I didn't really think too much of it.   I suppose through nine holes, you know, I was more thinking of, you know, if I could get through here in 1‑ or 2‑under par sort of thing, it would have been nice.   I certainly wouldn't have been running away from the field but would have kept me up there. 
As it turned out, it wouldn't have been the end of the world if I didn't have those two 3‑putts, it could be okay.   It would be passable.   But the great thing is, having shot a good score yesterday, I felt as if I played the best golf on the weekend I would be the winner.   Which puts me under more pressure to do that but still I'm in good position. 

Q.   Is this the two extremes of your game the last two days? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Wasn't a great deal of difference in the two rounds.   I hit some good iron shots that went close yesterday.   I got a lot of shots that I liked and wanted yesterday. 
Today, you know, some things didn't go well.   Golf is a bit like that.   There might have been‑‑ I might have played‑‑ might have been three or four shots different than the way I played in the two days.   There wasn't 12 shots difference.   I hope that's as bad as I ever play, because I'd be thrilled if that was.
