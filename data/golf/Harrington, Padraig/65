 Q.  Well played.  Six birdies and just one dropped shot.  What's pleased you most about your round?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I putted well.  At times I haven't been putting very well after the last number of years.  I putted well today, so that really made the score.   
Hit some -- can't say I played brilliant, but I certainly putted nicely and worked my way around the golf course.   
 Q.  Just watched you in the Pro-Am for a while yesterday.  Although having a bit of fun, you looked like you were hitting the ball very well?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I always do on Wednesday.  That's been the story with me for a while now.  It's the same again today, I was a bit tense at times.  Wasn't really free flowing tee to green.  Caution at times.   
Yesterday in the Pro-Am, it's a lot easier.  I always play well Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  It's one of those things, I would like to see -- holing a few putts will obviously free me up a little bit more.  I can do that the next three days, I should see things improving.   
 Q.  Nice to see this tournament back on the map.  Big crowds.  And important in a way to get off to a good start?  
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: That's important in all tournaments to get a good start.  You have got to build momentum in an event.  It could be as subtle as missing a few putts early on and you are struggling there and you see 6-under leading and you are wondering if all of a sudden you are on the cut line.  Whereas if you make a few birdies, you are going forward and you tend to keep going forward.  A huge part of our game is momentum.
