 Q.   Two shots better than yesterday's 71, how was your play compared to yesterday?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Probably was a little bit better yesterday.   Certainly a little bit better into the groove but my irons, maybe I was better off the tee today.   Showed a lot of good signs.   I rolled the ball really nicely today.   Nearly every putt I took, I gave the hole a run.   Certainly scared it a few times.   So, yeah, I was happy with that.   
   
 Q.   Looks like there are lots of positive signs in your game.   Is that the way you feel?   Where do you feel your game is?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, you know, I've been telling you it's coming for a good while.   So I'm always optimistic but I'm seeing some great signs out there.   I'm getting a quality strike on a lot of shots and as I said, I seem to be rolling the ball nicely so just kind of have to get used to it now and run with it.   
   
 Q.   What's Dave Alred doing for you? You started working with him this week.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   He's a busy man.   I actually at the Irish Open last year when I said I was going to make a change, I drove 2 1/2 hours to see him.   The first time I could get an appointment with him was this date, this week.   So it's taken six months.   
It's been worth the wait.   It's been real interesting.   He's been certainly generous with his‑‑ he's very giving.   He's worked with everybody on my team, because obviously I bring a few people with me.   Yeah, I really found it very useful.     Everybody's trying to figure out what he does; what is he.   
   
 Q.   That's what I asked you.   What does he do?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Certainly the reason I have employed him is he's a practise coach for me.   You know, he's making me more diligent in my practise.   As I said all through last year, I felt I played well in practise and just never took it to the golf course.   
He's all about, you know, taking your practise to the golf course.   Really we time the practise, we count the balls.   There's a lot of things‑‑ it's really putting a lot more precision into the practise.   
  
Q. Thoughts on the weekend?  
             PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   8‑under par, if it's only one guy, it's not too far behind.   But if there's a whole six or seven guys or eight or nine guys on 6‑, 7‑ , 8‑under par, 4‑under is a little bit of work to do.  
Yeah, it's nice to have played solidly, as I said and I shot 3‑under today, with three 3‑putts.   They were all very long‑range 3‑putts.   I actually putted very well in all of them.   So you know, overall, I shot 69 with ease.   
   
 Q.   You look at all departments of your game, how would you rate them at this stage and where you would want them to be at this stage of the season?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Well, at this stage of the season, everything is looking rosy, but it always is at the start of the year.   You're always optimistic that everything is going to fall into place.   I would say, yeah, I'm comfortable with where I'm at and I do believe that I've seen some good signs.   
Yeah, I see quite a bit.   I've done some nice work with Pete Cowen and getting a good understanding of what I'm trying to do there.   I'm starting to work with Dave Alred and I'm getting a nice transfer for the work that's going on on the range, and things are starting to‑‑ I'll be happy if I keep playing like I played the last two days for the rest of the year.   I'm going to have some good weeks.   
   
 Q.   Can you explain more about the role that Dave Alred plays?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   He's very hands‑on.   If I was trying to pigeon hole him into one specific job, you would say he's a practise coach.   You know, he's monitoring what I do in practise, how I practise, and we are trying to get the biggest transfer from the practise round to the golf course.   So that would be pigeon holing it into one thing.   
He obviously crosses the line to a number of other elements through his own experience.   But I suppose at the top of his C.V., he watches that you do the right thing when you're practicing and you don't get loose.  
   
 Q.   And presumably, you've monitored the success that Luke Donald has enjoyed working with him which must have attracted you to his services.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   As I've always said my whole life, I've always watched everybody else.   I want to know what everybody else is doing.   I want to know when guys are not playing well just as much as I want to know when guys are playing well.   There's no point in only having your own experience if you've got to learn from other people.   You'd be retired and very experienced if you were just waiting on yourself.   
Yeah, I pay attention.   I watch.   Obviously I played with Luke at The Ryder Cup, so Dave was working with him there, so I would have seen him at that stage and followed‑‑ tried to get an idea what he's doing.   
Yeah, as I said, it's taken six months to get an appointment with him.   So, you know, he's a busy man and he's good at what he does.   
   
 Q.   What are your feelings for this year?   Obviously last year was a disappointment.   You've made significant changes.   As you go in, how could you describe your mood for 2012?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Last year while I definitely performed well below average, I actually got three really good things out of it.
