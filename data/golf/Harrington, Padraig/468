Q.  Padraig, you wanted a fast start, you got off to that fast start, obviously disappointing the way it went from then on?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It was a great round of 71, that's all I can say.  I really, really struggled today.  My mind was racing all day, so I couldn't quiet things down.  I struggled to read putts, all the way struggled.  So to shoot 71, birdie two of the last four, was a miracle, really.  It was one of those days.  Even a couple early birdies weren't from good golf.

Just one of those things.  You know, just preparation wasn't so good this morning and just got off on the wrong foot.
Q.  As you say on the wrong foot, how do you say tomorrow, don't do the same again?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  That's the great thing about this game is there always is tomorrow.  One of the things I was thinking of out there was I wasn't just trying to finish this round out.  I felt, you know, like when I    I was saying to myself, I have 24 holes left rather than six holes and the key was to try to get in today without doing too much damage so I could give myself a chance to shoot a low one tomorrow to get back into it.
Q.  Plenty of positives in that last four holes.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, but I was still out of it, I didn't know what I was doing to be honest.  I've got to say, I made a couple of birdies in the last couple of holes, but it could easily have been pars.  So I can't say I was on top of things at all today.
