Q. The commentators were saying it could have been a whole lot better; is that how it feels to you?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, like even the birdies on 8 were all pretty short.  You know, relatively short, 8-footers type things, and then I had a few at the end, as well, and there on 18.  Yeah, definitely could have been quite low, yeah.  Very much so.
Q. Last year you told me that you were approaching this golf course tactically by taking on the short par 4s, and taking the driver there and putting yourself in great positions.  Is that the same tactic this year?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I've been hitting the same clubs off those short par 4s.  I don't recall as bullish this year strangely enough but it worked well today.  I was very aggressive on those holes and left myself pretty short irons into it.  They weren't necessarily the ones I made the birdies on all the same but I certainly had opportunities on those holes.
Q. Three Top-10s in your last six starts.  To us it looks like you're trending towards a victory.  Is that how it feels to you?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I've been in decent form now from midsummer onwards.  A bit disappointed with some erratic putting over the past couple weeks, which had not been as bad early in the year.  Certainly got my head in the game and working on the right things.  Again, I need to be on the course, though.  It's very hard in practice rounds.  It's so different.  Yeah, I need to be out on the course and playing and hitting the shots with that sort of -- with a card in your hand, and I see some good things out there, and you know, hopefully more this week.
Q. I've got to ask you a Ryder Cup question.  Yesterday your press conference was 90 percent Ryder Cup questions and you haven't been appointed captain yet but it's rumored.  How does it feel to be talking about it when as yet you don't know you're going to be captain?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It's very difficult, it really is.  I don't want to putt a spanner in the works and I don't want to be cocky, conceited, any of those things, and yet the questions keep coming back to it.  I've said my name's in the hat.  Really I probably should come up with a one-line statement but that's not me.  When it happens, we'll see.  It's tough to talk about it, isn't it.  You know, let's talk about Thomas's Ryder Cup, that's a better one to talk about, and how good that was, and we'll leave the next one on to the side.
