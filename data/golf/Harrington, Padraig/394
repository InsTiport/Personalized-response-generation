 Q.  Great finish? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, it was nice to chip-in.  Obviously a long way behind, and I hoped to gain on the leader today and not fall further behind but Graham, it seems to be his week, even though Jeev is pushing them. 

 Q.  How were conditions? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  The course is playing -- it's there for the taking.  You know, there's not much wind.  The ball is going out there, so, yeah, it's definitely on.  Pin positions are not too severe or anything like that.  Scoring is on. 

 Q.  You get off to a sort of hot start tomorrow, anything can happen still, though, can't it? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  If I was ahead or behind, I would still be trying just the same tomorrow and it's irrelevant to go out and play as well as I can.  If I get a slow start I would still be trying on the back nine or if I get off to a quick start, I would still be trying.  No matter what I do tomorrow, it's still outside my hands, which is a pity.
