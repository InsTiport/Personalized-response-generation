  Q. You just had a 4-under par 67 on that golf course, what are your thoughts?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm thrilled with it. I know that it's not leading tournament or whatever, but before you head out on this golf course, you don't know what you're going to shoot. It really is a testing, intimidating golf course and to break 70, if I can continue that this week, I'll be a very happy man.  
  
  Q. Not only to break 70, but it's a thinking man's golf course; you did it with no bogeys.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: As I say my short game was sharp today and when I did miss, I missed in the right places and I'm happy that I holed the right putts at the right time.   
 I won't say it was because I had some insight to avoid bogeys. This is a tough golf course and you just have to hit the shots a lot of times. But definitely the odd time I did get away with it.
