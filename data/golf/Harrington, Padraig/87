  PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, it's always nice to finish with a birdie.   Yeah, it was okay.   I hit a lot of shots to 15, 20 feet, 25 feet, and I obviously‑‑ doesn't matter how well you put.   You're not going to hole those sorts of putts consistently.   
Kind of felt a little bit frustrating out there but I didn't really hit anything really tight, and it was nice to hole the one on the last.   It's always nice to birdie the last hole before lunch.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about this golf course and the challenge it represents.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It's a good course.   There's plenty in it.   The light breeze today helped out today on a number of holes.   We got it as easy as it could possibly be.   A couple of the longer par 4s played downwind.   They could set it up anyway to be honest.   
If you short‑side yourself, it could be very difficult but there is opportunities.   The couple of greens I missed today I made two really good up‑and‑downs on and that really kept the score going.   
But for sure if you're playing well, you know, the greens are a nice texture, so you can fire at the pins and they will be‑‑ I see some good scoring out there and that's what I expect.   
   
 Q.   Interested to get your appraisal of where you are with your game; where do you think you are now?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I played slightly different to maybe what I would have played‑‑ seems like I hit a lot more shots to 20 feet and I don't hole too many putts, and then I miss the odd green and don't get up‑and‑down.   
Today I got up‑and‑down, and you know, I'm happy with what I'm seeing with my game.   A bit of momentum wouldn't do it any harm, and I see that with a lot of players; it's amazing what momentum does to a guy's game, and holing the odd 12‑footer for par when you haven't played the hole well can make an extraordinary difference to the next tee shot.
