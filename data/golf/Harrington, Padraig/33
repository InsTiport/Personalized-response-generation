 Q.  Your thoughts on two very contrasting rounds over the last two days in two very different contrasting weather conditions?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, sure was.  I played the same all the time.  I didn't change; it was the weather.   
You know, I just didn't get the breaks yesterday.  I got plenty of them today.  That's the difference in the scoring, that's all.  I holed three nice par putts today, and yesterday, I missed a lot of short ones.   
 Q.  Is that the frustration of this game?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: You know what, it's not frustrating at this stage.  It's the way the game is.  If you play it as long as I do and you don't get to grips with it like that, you're going to end up in a home, not in a -- yeah, you're going to be struggling.   
So it is what it is.  As much as you might want to label it frustrating, I think I got past that ten years ago.   
 Q.  With The Open Championship at Birkdale coming up next week, what positives do you take into that tournament from this week?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: I played nicely.  Try not to read -- the clichÃ© of doing it day-by-day.  So if I shot a bad number today, I wasn't going to go into The Open any less happy than if I shot a good number.  That's the attitude I have to take.  I'm sure deep down it has an effect, but I have to get over that and not let it be; not let each round's score dictate how I feel about my golf.   
 Q.  How much are you looking to going back to Birkdale, a place that holds such fantastic memories for you?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  I'm looking forward to my golf at the moment.  That's the main thing.
