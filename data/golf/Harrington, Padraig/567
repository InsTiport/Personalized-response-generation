Q.  Probably pretty satisfied with that day's work, a lot of patience involved?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, I'm very happy.  Obviously it was a strange day.  I played very poorly yesterday, so I wasn't expecting to play too well today.  And I was hoping that my putting would be on.  So when I hit it to six feet in the first three holes and missed them for birdies, it was certainly like it turned on its head.

So I needed to be patient after that.  I kept playing well all the way through and didn't do anything stupid.  I was unlucky, didn't really make any birdies when I had opportunities, but then made a nice birdie at the 11th.

Once you're getting under par, things are okay.  I hit it stone dead at the 4th, as well, my 13th hole, 2-under.  Things are going well.  Holed about a eight-footer on the 6th and about a 12-footer on the 8th.

To be honest, pretty stress-free rounds.  I only had two chip shots and a bunker shot all day, and I hit those stone dead, so I didn't put myself under too much pressure.
Q.  Was it a case of something clicking with the putting as the round went on?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  No, I only holed two putts the whole day, so nothing really clicked in the putting.  I just stayed patient and kept going.  The first two birdies were stone dead, and the next were two pretty short putts, so I need to do something to work on my putting.
Q.  I know it's still early days, but given your expectation level at the start of the round, what's your feeling now?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I'm very pleased.  There would be nobody who would walk off that golf course who isn't happy with 68, so I'm very happy.  Obviously, as I say, I wasn't too keen in my form after yesterday's practice round, but it seemed to be all right today.
