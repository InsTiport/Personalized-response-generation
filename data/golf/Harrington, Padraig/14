Q. People talking about preparation for the second Major of the year.  Talk about Tiger, he hasn't played since he won at Augusta.  Talked about Brooks Koepka because he defends.  Talk about Jordan Spieth because he's looking to be the 6th person to win the day Career Gland Slam.
Nobody is talking about Padraig Harrington.  You just placed a 65 in the final round after a good week here.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Look, I'm happy that -- happy going down the stretch there, obviously.  Still I was a little bit nervous.  I need that.  I'm not going to win a tournament, you want to have the emotions that the shots are important.
I'm certainly pleased with my week and so, you know, plenty of birdies today.  It's a nice golf course.  There's opportunities that are boundless.  Nice and wide open off the tee for me as well.
Q. You're working on some things, you must now be looking forward to next week.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No doubt about it.  I would have -- you always wish you had a couple more weeks but I came into the last three weeks thinking -- well, I hurt my wrist during the week or so and kind of pushing it along trying to get ready, and the idea was three weeks into the PGA to trying to get ready.
I normally play two.  Everybody has a different way.  I'm pushing it.  Have a little bit of form that I'm happy about for those three weeks.
Q. Are you heading to New York just now?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Going to be on the road pretty soon.
Q. Is it going to be Harrington Air?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Absolutely.
