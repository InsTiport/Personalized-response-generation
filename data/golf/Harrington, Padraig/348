 Q. What's your verdict? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: It was an interesting day. Obviously I played very well going into the wind and didn't get rewarded for it, didn't hole the putts. Coming home, you know, it was a bit more of the same. But holed two nice putts on the last two greens. So I feel good about my round and feel good about going into tomorrow and the next day. 

 Q. Especially in these punishing conditions, to round it off with a birdie like that to be in a fine position, it's got to be good? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I struggled all day on the greens and I holed a 15-footer on 17 for par and a 10-footer, 12-footer on the last for birdie and felt good about that. Looking forward to getting out there now on the weekend. 

 Q. Ready for that wonderful experience at Carnoustie?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I always look forward to Carnoustie regardless of whether I was playing a tournament or not. If anything, actually playing the tournament takes a little bit of the -- I've got to go out there and work hard. I can't quite go out there and swan around and enjoy it. But I do look forward to going back there. 
 I'm looking forward to playing any links golf courses; for the Open Champion it's quite special. 

 Q. I take it the wife had a quiet word last night?
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, quite straightforward: Beard has got to go.
