 Q. What is the baby update then?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Nothing to report. I called this morning again and everything is exactly as it was. I just have to make one more day now. Everything is great. But we are both a little anxious now to be honest that I do make it home. I'm anxious and edgy to get home, I think the closer it gets to getting home, the worse I'm getting. Obviously we have been saying it is due to be late, but this is late now, so it could be any moment now, so there will be anxious moments now until I get home.

Q. Golf today?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I was going okay but missed a few fairways on the back nine and the greens at the short holes, holes you can make birdies on if you are in position. It is a tough enough course if you get out of position and I did. I parred the last five which was okay but it was the tenth, 11th, and 12th, where I had hoped to make some birdies, that I didn't do so well on.


Q. Off to make another call?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes indeed, the mobile is never off. 

Q. You are definitely out of next week in Germany though?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yes 100 per cent out, I have officially withdrawn.
