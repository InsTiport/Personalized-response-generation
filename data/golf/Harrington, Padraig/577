START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT







Q. Up and down day?

PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well the start was up and down but the rest of it was pretty similar to yesterday. Just hitting a few bad shots because I feel a little bit uncomfortable at times, and not really holing the putts either. I putted really well from distance but not so well short in.



Q. How is Caroline bearing up?

PADRAIG HARRINGTON: She's fine, absolutely no movement, I was on to her this morning, but she's fine.



Q. She must be tearing her hair out?

PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No not at all, not in the slightest. I think we are both anxious now that we get home in time. With the way this week is going it would be a bit of a disappointment to miss out. I'll keep my fingers crossed. But the ball is in her court. I'll be out on Sunday night though, definitely the way I'm playing. She is now four days late. 



Q. What about the Order of Merit now?

PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Hopefully when I come back out, as long as I'm still in range, I'll be quite happy. I'm going through a period at the moment where I feel like things are good and am just waiting for things to settle down and as a result I am looking forward to the end of the year. Swing is there, everything is there, it is just a case of getting focused. I normally have a good end to the year so hopefully I can again. I think that there are three events which will be key, the German Masters, the dunhill and the American Express, they'll be big events.
