  Q. This time last year was a wonderful occasion and one to remember. Would you rather forget today?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, no.  
  
  Q. Were you disappointed with the round today?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Last year was, yeah, very good.   
 I was thinking about when I was on 18, I had about a three- or four-footer and I was thinking about what holing out last year meant and things like that. So yeah, it was very nice memories at that stage, very good indeed.   
 Today's round, just one of those things. I played average, got caught out a few times, struggled with my concentration and didn't hole the putts.   
  
  Q. You're taking a bit of time off and then a couple of crucial weeks coming up for you?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I have a week off and then a couple of tournaments, Wales and Memphis and then U.S. Open. Nothing we can't handle.  
  
  Q. Something to look forward to?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Yeah, I'm very happy with my game, so yeah, I'm looking forward to -- I always look forward to playing golf. Why wouldn't you? Yeah, so another week off.   
 I'd like to be playing next week, to be honest. I feel like playing. But I know I need to take the week off.   
 There's a couple of good weeks there to get my game in shape, get my game in form so I'm ready for the U.S. Open.  
  
  Q. What about the Irish U.S. Open just as a whole? Do you think it's been a success, because it's maybe been getting some bad press?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Has it?   
  
  Q. Well, just in the buildup to it people were saying maybe it was in trouble, but I think it was a success. What do you think?  
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I'm glad I don't read the newspapers.  
  
  Q. No, it's TV (laughter).   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: No, I think players-wise the tournament is building. As I said, the Irish Open has a few years to get status back, I think. It has slipped down in the minds of the European Tour players in terms of stature, coming to good golf courses. You have to build it up to get it back to where it was in its heyday in the '80s and early '90s where every European player wanted to win the Irish Open.  
  
  Q. I know you'll be looking forward to coming back and trying to get your hands on that trophy next time out.   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: Always would be. Irish Open is a big deal. Glad I have it now. I've got one win under my belt. That's a nice way -- it's always very disappointing, harder to take the weeks that you don't win when you haven't won one, so it's nice that I won it last year. It makes this week all the easier.   
  
  Q. How do you look at this week, do you think, in general?   
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON: I just had an awful week on the greens, just characterized by today. If I hit a good putt on the line I wanted to hit it on, I seemed to have misread it, and if I seemed to have got the right line, I seemed to have hit a bad putt. You know, it goes like that.   
 I would actually say I played really good golf. I hit a few average tee shots today, which cost me dearly early on. But each of those holes I really still had a chance of making my pars. You're not holing the putts -- it's a double negative. If you miss the putt, not only do you lose that shot, but you feel like you're playing so well, and you've got the next hole and you've lost a bit of momentum. There's nothing wrong with my putting, nothing wrong with my game. It's just a question of letting it happen and waiting for the good things to happen.
