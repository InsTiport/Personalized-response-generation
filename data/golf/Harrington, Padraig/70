 Q.   Not the day you were hoping for.   Tell us about the round.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Didn't get off to a great start.   A couple offer rabbit shots, I didn't really recover them around the green.   I struggled around the greens all day and on a tough day like this, you have to be knocking the putts in and getting up‑and‑down to keep the momentum in the round and I just didn't do that today.   That's the way it is.  
   
 Q.   What was today like compared to the first to days?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   A little bit disappointed because when I came up here six weeks ago we played in the exact same wind today so that should have been to my liking today.   I had no problems with the conditions.   I wanted a good test out there, as I said, I couldn't get any momentum in the round.   I just missed too many putts.  
   
 Q.   How would you sum up the first three rounds?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Obviously it's all gone now, so enjoy tomorrow, that's it.   
   
 Q.   Finishing on a high is the aim now?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Everybody plays hard.   You never know when a good round will bring some momentum to you.   You never know when a good shot can spark you off.   I'll be looking forward to tomorrow and hoping that I play well to, as I said, create a bit of confidence going forward.  
   
 Q.   You must be hurting after being in a good position after nine holes yesterday?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   That's the way it goes.   Disappointed but not for a lack of trying.   Nothing I can do about it.   
I didn't play great.   I would have needed a good day on the greens to get some momentum.   That's quite important if things are not going 100 percent for you, you've got to hole the putts and I didn't do that today.   You hole a few putts, keeps you in things and you play better because of it.   That's the nature of the game.  
   
 Q.   You were still there after you birdied the 7th?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   From hitting a lot of fairways, it was a bad double program at 8.   That really was a bit of an issue.   It was a simple shot played up the left and get on with it .   The double‑bogey and then the 3‑putts on 11, 13 and 15, having played all the holes well‑‑ I wasn't shooting 65.   
   
 Q.   Could you believe the scoring given the conditions?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I think the golf course can give it up but it is a very impressive score all the same.   You have to go ask do it and fair play to the lads who performed well.   
   
 Q.   SÃ¸ren Kjeldsen, what do you thinkof his play?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   This is a perfect golf course for him.   This really suits somebody like SÃ¸ren who is not going to hit the ball too high.   He's a clever player, can work his way around there.   So, yeah, I think he's enjoying these conditions.
