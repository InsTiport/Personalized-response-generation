 Q.  Always nice to finish with a birdie.  Overall, how do you feel about that round?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Well, it's nice to finish with a birdie, but yeah, I didn't hole too many putts.  It's hard, it's a tough enough day, you have to create momentum.  You have to hole a few putts to get going, get ahead of the game, sort of thing.  It was a bit of a tough day like that.   
I left a few shots out there early on, and then just made for a long, hard day.   
 Q.  And conditions today, what were they like?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: They were not anywhere as tough as yesterday, but they were tough enough for the first nine holes, we had rain, but no wind.  The wind wasn't as strong.  It was quite playable.  As I said, you just get some momentum in those sort of conditions, it doesn't feel so bad.  That's why you see some good scores, some low numbers.  It's one of those things; if you can get ahead of it on a bad day, it never feels so bad.   
 Q.  Speaking of low numbers, Robert Rock, shooting 60 here today.  Put into context how good that is.  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: It was a good score considering he had all the bad weather that was there today, he had it.  Yeah, it was a big figure to put up on the board.  He's justifiably in the lead.
