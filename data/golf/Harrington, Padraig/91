  PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   It didn't hurt or anything, but when I couldn't grip the 15th tee, you know, there's more output than anything else.

Q.   What sort of treatment did he give you?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Just took -- stretched it out, put some cream on it, anti-inflammatories, everything he could, but it needed time.   You know, I'm sure I won't even think about it tomorrow, I'll have a bit of things on it later.   As I said, I know where I put pressure on my grip.

Q.   Did you know that you could let a group play through?   Seemed like when Mark Russell pulled up, it's in the regulation.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Pretty standard practice in Europe.   You get ten, 15 minutes for your first medical, yeah.

Q.   Have you ever done this before?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Been injured?

Q.   No, where it's happened on the golf course and --
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah.   Many times.   I don't know if we let somebody through before, no, but no, probably I certainly had it happen on the golf course plenty of times.   Terrible troubles with my neck for a year.   I was a regular.

Q.   Going to say I can't recall getting your finger before.
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   No.   It's a weird one.   I have stodgy fingers.

Q.   Which one was it?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   That one.

Q.   Could you not bend it?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I -- when I took the club back, I couldn't put any pressure on it and tighten it.   I know now where I tighten my grip on my back swing, I lift it up there.   Like I said, on 15 I stood there with a driver.   When I eventually went to hit, I tried to hit 3-wood because I wasn't -- I hit that in the woods.   By the end of the round, I don't think I was even gripping with that finger.   It was basically -- it was there but, you know, it wasn't -- it certainly wasn't -- you know, kind of like I was in -- it wasn't awful pain.   It's just a distraction, yeah.

Q.   Were you thinking about the cut line at the time, that's it for the weekend?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I knew I was close to the cut line, you know, at 1-under par.   I just made a nice birdie.   I was in good form actually walking onto the 15th tee.   It didn't do me any favors.   You know, a convenient excuse at the end of the day or what, you know.   It certainly -- it pretty much certainly caused a bogey on 15, anyways, that's for sure.

Q.   Is that where you want to be putting pressure on your golf grip?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Don't want to think about it.   One thing we don't do is think about grip pressure.
