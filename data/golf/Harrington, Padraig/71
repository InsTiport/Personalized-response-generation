  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Thanks for joining us.   Everyone will join me for commending your decision to come in due to the weather.   Just start us off with your assessment of the day and take some questions.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Obviously I'm disappointed with the finish.   I was very comfortable through 28 holes, putt there to go 8‑under par and everything was easy at that stage.   
Yeah, it was disappointing I suppose.   What I went through over the last six or seven holes is what most of the players are going through all the time, so I feel bad, but as I said, it seems to be the way that most of the course is playing for most of the guys.   Hopefully I won't do it again over the weekend.   Hopefully I've had my bad run.   
   
 Q.   What happened on thesecond?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Second day in a row, I had the simplest shot in there from a nice position and I just pushed it right, missed the green, chipped it up to eight feet, missed the putt.   Really didn't bother me, a bogey, such is life.   I got into some trouble on the next hole and I 3‑putted.   That wasn't great and I 3‑putted the next one from off the green.   
Those two 3‑putts were bad.   I could have limited the damage for sure.   I nearly holed my tee shot on 4, so that was a little disappointing.   Nice to come back with a couple of pars and make the birdie.   
4‑under par with two to play and the last two holes not playing so bad, that looked that was a pretty decent position.   A little disappointed with the way I finished.   I hit a lovely chip on 8.   Looked like it would be stone dead and then I hit a nice putt and it missed.   
9, hit a beautiful tee shot, thought it was on the fairway, and you know, I ended up being in the right rough coming across that bank.   It really wasn't where you wanted to be and I didn't hit a good shot or a good chip.   
So it was a little bit disappointing on 9, as I said, I did hit a really nice tee shot but being in the right rough with a right pin was not a good idea in a right wind and everything that was happening at that stage.   
   
 Q.   To be right up there in contention, you must be pleased considering the other end of the leaderboard.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I am pleased to be in contention.   Clearly I would have preferred to be that 7‑, 8‑under par type thing where I would be in a good position to move away from the field on the weekend.   I'm now in a position that I'm going to have to play well on the weekend and not get anything going against me.   There will be a lot of people just making the cut this weekend that will feel like they have a chance of winning now that I've come back to the pack in some way.   
It's going to be a much tougher weekend.   I won't have the luxury of having any bad runs, let's say.   I'll have to stick in there and play well and hope things actually go in my favour.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Compared to being 7‑, 8‑under par‑‑ but it is what it is.   Yeah, it is going to be very much like that.   I could see where my mistakes came from today, so if I can eliminate some of those, I should be in a good place for the weekend.   It's not that I'm not going to make bogeys, or even pretty good to avoid a double‑bogey over the next 36 holes.   But see what I need to do and I'll sit and think about that and hopefully, as I said, through 36 holes, I'll limit the amount of times I do that.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned yesterday that you have to be very aggressive today.   What was the game plan?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   The game was easy the first ten holes.   No, it wasn't‑‑ I certainly wasn't overaggressive.   Wasn't underaggressive.   Quite happy with the decisions I made all day.   I can't look back and say I chose the wrong shot at any particular time.  
I'd say golf could be a strange game at times.   The last couple of holes I was in heather a couple of times and on 8, a little bit of heather, and that's the same place I was in the 36‑hole of the playoff and my ball went right out of the heather.   Today it went left.   And on 9 I'm sort of thinking, don't hit it right out of the rough and I hit it left.   It's amazing what can get in your head at times.  
In terms of clubbing decisions, going at pins, I'm very comfortable with the way I've managed my way around the golf course.   Yes, at times, I'd like to hit the shots better but no bad decisions.   
   
 Q.   Compared to Carnoustie and other links in Ireland, where does it fit now compared to here‑‑  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It's such a different test to this golf course.   Yeah, this is much more testing in and around the greens.   I think Carnoustie greens are virtually flat.   There's not a huge amount of run‑offs in Carnoustie.   Here, it's all run‑offs.   It's all slope.   
Both golf courses are obviously difficult, but Carnoustie's is tee‑to‑green and here it's all around the greens.   
   
 Q.   Having already won The Irish Open already, is the pressure gone, or are you still feeling it this week?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   The pressure wouldn't be gone but it certainly is less, or I'm certainly trying to make myself believe at least.   Yes, having won one is always nice.   It's something if you had not done it, it would be something to miss in my C.V. if I had not won an Irish Open.   
Doesn't mean I'm not trying any less this week.   And at the end of the day, the pressure to win any tournament is enough to keep your mind occupied.   I do say there is more distraction at an Irish Open; the times you hit a golf shot and you've actually let people down is not a normal emotion out there.   But for sure during The Irish Open, you do‑‑ sometimes you hit a bad shot and you want to tell everybody, it was actually really difficult (laughing).   
I think I missed a putt out there, actually on No.2.   I missed the putt.   I hit it where I wanted.   I was toying between hitting a sort of right lip or outside the right lip and it missed.   Halfway there I hear a tut‑tut.   I did hit it‑‑ emotionally, you do get too involved at times with the support because they are willing you on so much; they care so much, and you're obviously trying to keep it neutral and not get in too much of a high.   So it is interesting, that's for sure.   
   
 Q.   When you would be at Birkdale in 2008‑‑ how would you sort of compare to these first two rounds here, do you feel you're doing better this week or better after two rounds at Birkdale?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, I've never even thought of comparing the two.   Birkdale, I actually got the wrong side of the draw, which really put me‑‑ it was a really tough first morning, and conditions were far tougher at Birkdale.   These seem very playable.  
I think this course is very playable in the conditions we have it in at the moment.   It's just a really a different test again than Birkdale.   This, as I said, is really around the greens, it's a real test.   Very few holes have you much problem if you miss the fairway; you can avoid the bunkers and you can get it up and around the green and if you have a short game like you're putting most of the time, you're hardly chipping that often.   You can get it done.   
So again, Birkdale is a little bit more like Carnoustie.   Tee‑to‑green you've got to hit a lot of really big shots.   Here, you've got to be very smart and have an awesome short game.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Thanks for coming in.
