 Q.  Disappointing? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Disappointing round, no question of that. 

 Q.  Are you still in it? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, no question about it. 

 Q.  A little flat today was it? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, if I thought I was going to hit it where I hit it off the tee all day, I would have sure I was in for a good score and I was very poor after that, just in-between clubs all day.  Just, you know, not good, flat.  3-putting the first, following it up, just didn't help today. 

 Q.  How important was that putt at the last, the 4 at the last? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I suppose it was -- yeah, you know, I need another 18 holes tomorrow and working on the principle maybe everything will go for me tomorrow.  Keep myself in it. 
 So it's nice to make a birdie. 

 Q.  Still any gas in the tank after last week? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Oh, it was terrible today. 

 Q.  Still a bit run down? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I played like it. 

 Q.  The two bogeys in the first three holes, take away any adrenaline you might have had? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  All day, you know, lots of mistakes out there to be honest.  You know, things didn't exactly go for me whatever, but if you were mentally fresh you would have got in there, 71, something like that.  It was just kept thinking I was in between clubs and fairways and you know, obviously didn't hole a putt out there for 18 holes, which isn't going to help. 
 Throw in a couple of 3-putts and, you know, actually probably about quite well to shoot 75.  I got it in great position off the tee all day and that's a lot of the work done out there.  A lot of the hard work is getting your ball in position.  So that was unfortunate that I couldn't take advantage of it. 

 Q.  And the million Euro bonus for tomorrow? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  The million Euro bonus, it's gone down a lot in value at the moment.  

 Q.  Just a flat day, it looked like, from your own perspective, your description of what happened today? 
 PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, that sums it up there.  I 3-putted the first, from there it was all downhill really after that, lots of mistakes, lots of errors, especially with the irons.  I just couldn't get comfortable every time I thought I was in between clubs and continued to make mistakes, a couple of 3-putts, and didn't hole anything.  I just was flat.  It's a very simple case of it not being in the tank today and that's unfortunate but that's the way it goes.  I'm going to hopefully have a good day tomorrow and not going to worry about it today.
