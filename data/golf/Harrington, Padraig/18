Q. You had a pretty good week here last year in this tournament.
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: Nice week, I finished fourth.  Was in contention on Sunday which was nice.  Played nicely.  Always good to get those feelings, so hopefully we'll have them back this week.
Q. What part of the game do you remember being at its best last year to get you that fourth place finish?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: :  A few good things happened.  I holed a wedge shot on 10 for a par on one of the days.  I think if I was looking for something that was good, I really hit it well off the short par 4s, some of them with water on it, I got the ball deep in play which was quite good.
I was very aggressive off those tees and gave myself birdie chances on holes that are -- not the long par 4s on this course, but the short ones, like 11 with water on the left.  Hit a lot of good tee shots on those holes which setup some good chances and turned them into birdie holes instead of bogey holes.
Q. I know you played a few holes with Shane this morning.  How is the course looking this year?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: :  It's great.  It's what we expect.  It's great facilities down here.  The golf course is excellent.  Looks ready to go, everything about it.  So hopefully we just have to play the golf.
Q. In terms of your game at the moment, it's been a pretty pleasing few weeks for you, three Top-10s, which is a nice way to end the season?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON: :  Yeah, been playing nicely.  Got my head on.  Know what I'm doing.  I feel good about where I'm at and where my game is going.
