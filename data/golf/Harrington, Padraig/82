 Q.   Talk about getting back to business after The Ryder Cup?  
    PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   We are used to that.   Every week is a new week on Tour.   I certainly enjoyed last week, and I particularly enjoyed Sunday night.   
    You know, maybe my preparation wasn't ideal coming in here on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, but you know, I know the golf courses well, so it wasn't a golf course that‑‑ I didn't have to play a lot before I got into the tournament to play here.   I'm comfortable on them.   
   
 Q.   You have to be happy with the score that is under par, somewhere under par, and you scored 6‑under.   What is your verdict?   
    PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, I was very happy.   I started off really hot.   Well, I was probably a bit tentative after that, but, you know, I'm pretty comfortable with the score.   It's always nice to shoot anything in the 60s around Carnoustie is a bonus, and you know, 54 holes to go, but I'm in nice position.   
   
 Q.   And how important was it from our point of view to have played Carnoustie under these kind of conditions, because with the weather forecast for the upcoming days, it's not really ideal?  
    PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, you know, we don't know.   Maybe it's important.   I'm not 100 percent sure.   You will just have to wait and see.   All depends on the direction of the wind and obviously if there is rain, on paper you would probably think, yes, get Carnoustie out of the way on the best day.   
    But in the end of the day, it's still kind of jockeying for the last 18 holes.   So yeah, it could be an advantage, no doubt about it, but just, who knows, who knows what the weather is going to be like.   It's too many‑‑ what's the word I'm looking for with this‑‑ too many out comes that we just don't know at this stage.   But certainly it doesn't look like a bad draw.   
   
 Q.   And generally speaking, the tournament itself, you seem to be very relaxed on the fairway and you're always going to have chat with the format.   How do you like it?   
    PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I really like it.   I play with the same partner every year and we get along great and work hard as a team but we also enjoy it a lot.   There's usually good partners, as well.   The pros tend to be quite relaxed.   Yeah, we do enjoy it.   There's more time to enjoy it.   Rounds are quite long obviously.   I was playing with Monty today and we had good fun, we always do on the golf course.   It certainly one of the most social events of the year and one of the most enjoyable events.   
   
 Q.   You're here at a coach that you've played on exceptionally well before.   Do you find that that helps, regardless of the crosswinds, regardless of the weather, you say, I like this course, the course likes me, and I'm going to play a good round.   
    PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I like windy conditions and things like that.   I think what helps here is when you kind of go through your routine.   You go out, your head is down and you're working away and you get on the first tee and the scorer reminds you that you won The Open Championship here, that's kind of nice.   You know, that was a little boost on the first tee box.   That sort of thing is a good reminder.   The spectators, that sort of thing, does remind you of good days back in 2007.   Up to that, yeah, I was‑‑ in some ways, you're trying to be disciplined but there is some fond memories of this course and it must help in some way when you're on the course.  
   
 Q.   Must be nice to have your name atop the leaderboard again.   You have another couple courses to play on.   Is it a tournament you'll be looking forward to be right in the mix on Sunday?  
    PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, I've won a couple of times, and I feel really good about my game.   So, yeah, I'm really looking forward to another 54 holes.   
   
 Q.   Well done, that was a good day at the office, was it not?   
    PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, it was obviously a pity to finish the way I did.   I didn't play the last two holes very well, but still nearly made two pars.   But certainly I'd have taken 6‑under, especially taking the style of it early on, I had two lip‑outs on the first seven holes and I was 5‑under par, which was slightly usual.   So I was really on form early on.   I got a little tentative after that, which you always do when you're that far under par.   But overall, I'm very pleased with it.   Some tough golf ahead of us, but it's nice to be at the top of the leaderboard knowing I don't have all the work to do for the next three days.
