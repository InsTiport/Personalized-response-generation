Q.   First day, 76, what do you make of that? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Obviously I got off to an okay start, and then I missed‑‑ took three from the edge on my fifth hole and then missed the par3, 13.   Once you miss that green left, you struggle to get it on the green and over the green in the water. 
Obviously, you know, being 3‑over par into 17 and 18, tough holes as it is.   I played nicely on the front nine for most of it, and disappointed to double the 7th hole, hit a decent tee shot but with the overhanging tree, touched the tree on the approach shot and missed the green.   Chipped it to about five feet and missed it. 
So I'm struggling in there and thinking I can get this back to maybe three or two over par.   It was obviously disappointing to finish at 6. 

Q.   When you went out there, you saw the good conditions, I assume you expected better than that?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   The expectations were reasonably high.   It wasn't very comfortable.   I haven't been very comfortable around the greens last week or this week, which isn't great, but ultimately you are going to miss a few greens, and that didn't help. 
Hitting the ball, I was reasonably comfortable and I didn't envisage too many problems.   Didn't really cause myself too many problems.   As I said, missing 15 was the bigger error. 

Q.   How do you approach the second round?   Obviously you attack now because scoring has been good and we don't know how it's going to be set up tomorrow. 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Practice, that's about it. 

Q.   You don't feel you're going to make the cut? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   It's irrelevant, the practice round‑‑ go out and try to play well whatever the score is.   That's what I'll be doing.   I have no idea, because I haven't seen the scoring myself at this stage.   I really don't know very much, but I see an opportunity to go and play a practice round really.
