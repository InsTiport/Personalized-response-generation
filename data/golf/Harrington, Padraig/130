Q.   5‑under opening round here in Dubai, how pleased are you?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I'm pleased with the score.   I didn't play very well in practise.   I found the golf course very difficult in practise.   I certainly would have taken anything under par going out there. 
I shot 5‑under.   I could have been a lot better.   Not a big worry on the first day of the tournament.   You know, it certainly could have been numerous shots better but doesn't really matter whether you're leading or not at the end of the first day.   Just matters that you're still in the tournament, so I'm happy enough.

Q.   How much have playing conditions changed with the rain this morning?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It should have.   I hit wood into a lot of par 4s into practise here.   The golf course, you know, I played early Tuesday and the ball just wasn't going, and the weather‑‑ maybe I was a bit tired I don't know, but I found it a real tough course on Tuesday.   It was a lot better today.   Played very reasonable today.

Q.   How did you spend the last week coming into this last week?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I spent it in bed.   I had the flu all week in Hong Kong.   I played two rounds of golf and I supposed Pro‑Am and whatever.   But the rest of it, I was holed up in bed trying to recover from the flu. 

Q.   Do you feel better now? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I have a little bit of a cough and I have to be mindful to not overdo it.   On Tuesday, I suffered a bit of a relapse so I won't be doing too much practise this week, taking it easy. 

Q.   So what's made the difference if you didn't play particularly well and found it difficult in practise and yet you've shot 67 today?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, I shot 67 doing handstands today.     Sometimes you do that when your expectations are low; it can really help.   I think that was very much the case for me going out there.   I think a lot of times this year, I've been really confident going into the tournament the first couple of rounds, and you know, nothing pleases me. 
Today I wasn't very confident, so anything was going to keep me happy out there today, and I kind of worked like that.   I played with Anders Hansen.   He started off very well, which kept me going as well.   We chatted all day.   We had a nice, relaxed day and everything about the round was really easy to be honest.

Q.   And I assume the expectations change now as a result of this?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Well, you know, that's always the case.   You play well one day and you're thinking it's going to be just as easy for the rest of the week but obviously that's not going to be the case. 
As I said, I missed an awful lot of chances out there to shoot 5‑under par.   You don't play like that every day and I'm not expecting to play like that for the rest of the week. 

Q.   That's obviously a very pleasing way to start the week, a week where the expectations weren't the highest?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   No, as I said, I had the flu last week and I was struggling a bit coming in here.   I found the course very difficult in practise.   I didn't play very well. 
So my expectations were low and usually that's a good thing when you go out on the golf course.   I was quite patient there when things didn't go my way and then things turned around nicely and all of the sudden I went from maybe struggling and watching the guys up on the leaderboard thinking, it's not that easy, to finishing up and being disappointed with my 5‑under. 

Q.   Was it something that clicked on the course for you or just a natural progression as a stress‑free round kind of developed? 
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Nothing particularly clicked out there.   As I said, I'm working away on a few things with Pete Cowen on the range, and was caught a little bit between two stools. 
The last sort of 24 hours, just trying to put something together that I could go out and play with rather than necessarily thinking of moving forward that much.   Sometimes that can be the best way when you go out on the golf course here.   You're quite accepting of hitting a bad shot. 
It's frustrating when you hit a bad shot when you think you're playing well.   So as I wasn't thinking I wasn't playing well, I wasn't as much pressure to not hit a bad shot, let's say.

Q.   How would you describe your year?
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Looking forward to 2013.   I played well, really solidly in the U.S., particularly, and improved a lot of areas in my game but I still didn't score so well and didn't hole the putts.   I've been working hard on my putting and definitely feel like I've turned it around. 
Hit a lot of good putts today and that's the important thing, I'm concentrating more on hitting good putts and not worrying so much about whether to go in and hopefully at the end of the week it will all add up to a few more putts holed.
