Q.   Was this a day of what might have been?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, you know, I hit it very close every day.   I haven't seen any of the golf, but I'd be surprised if people had as many short putts as I had for birdie today.   I putted well, I just didn't hole them.   I wasn't reading them right.   But it was a good day all the way.   I played well, hit it well.   Very positive week.   So yeah, happy, save for the double bogey, but it's no disaster.   It's not like it cost me the tournament.   It might have cost me a few dollars.   That was it.

Q.   Can you take some positives away from this week? 
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   Yeah, all the way up until the end, I take a lot of positives out of the way I played today.   That's probably the most‑‑ I've won three majors, but that's the most comfortable I've felt through 18 holes in the last round of a major, and I was in a nice place mentally all day.   So yeah, I take very good positives.   I putted well all week, chipped well.   I did a lot of good things this week.

Q.   Is this a sign that you're back to your major championship winning form?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:   I hope so.   Yeah, I feel really good about where I‑‑ I feel I'm on an upswing, an upturn in my game.   So yeah, I'm looking forward to going forward.
