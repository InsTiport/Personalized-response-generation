 Q.   How was it today?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It was fine.   Honestly I think they were expecting worse conditions than we got.   A lot of tee boxes were up and pin positions were generous, so it was a lot better than we were expecting anyway.   It was very playable out there.  
   
 Q.   Overall, how do you look back on the four days from a personal point of view?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   It's disappointing to finish, but I was happy with my game.   I   didn't hole putts, but I did what I set out to do with my putting.   
So I don't feel like there's anything wrong with my putting even though I did have a bad week; I missed a lot of short putts and really killed me off the last 2 1/2 rounds.   But saying that, I didn't feel like I putted badly so reasonably happy with that going forward.   It will all fall into place and when it does, seen what I can do the first 27 holes.   Just stay patient and wait for that.  
   
 Q.   A question about the future of the tournament.   Would you like to see it continue as a links venue or parkland?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I would like it to go to the best venue and sometimes the best venue in Ireland is like a small town village.   It was a great event at Killarney, great event at Fota.   I know traditionally coming into links golf courses is what people expect of golf in Ireland but for enjoyment it's sometimes nice to go to, like Ballybunion was a great links, I know, but again, it's the town atmosphere that adds a lot to it and adds a lot for the players.   
There's lots of great venues.   It doesn't have to be a links golf course but yes, every so often we should go for a links.   
   
 Q.   Pleased with the week?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I was going quite nicely, finding it quite easy through 27 holes.   A little disappointing after that.   Just missed too many short putts.   And you need to hole those short putts in those conditions.   
Even then when you're missing a few of them, it's hard to hole the 20‑footers because you're worried about running it three feet by.   Yeah, I lost my momentum out there and that's a pity but short game just wasn't up to it this week.  
   
 Q.   As an event, for the week, what are you leaving here with, what memories?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   The Irish Open is always a great event for the Irish guys.   We have to look to the international players to see how they enjoy it.   I do believe that they have enjoyed this test and have enjoyed coming to Newcastle.   Everything about an event, it not just the golf course, but what surrounds it is very important for the players who travel.   So far I've only heard good things.  
   
 Q.   A lot of talk already about where we are going next year   The K Club is being mentioned, people saying should it stay at links or should it go to parkland courses; is it the right time in the calendar, any thoughts?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   There's a lot of things that go into the venue.   I personally like to go to the best venue and sometimes that can be a parkland golf course because of the surrounding area, the local town, the atmosphere that that brings to it.   
Yes, we should go to a links every so often and we shouldn't stay away from them but there's plenty of great parkland golf courses.   Killarney was a great event when it was there.   Fota was a great event.   Lots of options are available and it's important to consider the whole venue, not just the golf course.
