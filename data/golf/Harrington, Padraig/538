SCOTT CROCKETT:  Padraig, thank you for coming in.  How was your hand and how do you think it affected you through the course of your match?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I think this morning I couldn't put my thumb on the club at all.  Started out, it was awkward, to say the least.  But I didn't really play too badly.  So I'm not, you know, it certainly distracted me a number of times.  Didn't hole enough putts, made a few too many mistakes and Ernie didn't seem to make any mistakes.  That's why it was 5&4 over 30-something hole.  I didn't hole putts.  Ernie didn't give me any opportunities and I made a couple of mistakes.
Q.  Was it getting better as the match went on?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It definitely was getting better.  This morning I couldn't put it near the club, and after lunch I tried a few shots with it on the club and it wasn't too bad.  Awkward, but not too bad.
Q.  You seemed to have a technique of taking your thumb off the club?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  Yeah, I did that all day, all morning on all of the shots and then the afternoon I wasn't quite sure what I to do.  I was trying not to think about it too much and it can be just as awkward when it goes on and you're aware of it.  As I said, it felt awkward all the time.  I was trying not to be too aware, which most of the time, as I said, a few of them it felt awkward.  It was very painful this morning.  I couldn't to do anything with it.

But it definitely, at start of the afternoon, you know, it was painful, but it's not, how to do I put it -- it's not that the level of pain is a problem.  You can go through that.  But the problem was I couldn't -- I had to do it consciously.  If I tried to swing the golf club without thinking about it, the thumb just came off.  It wouldn't support.  So, you know, it just didn't want to do it, I would say.  It wasn't, you know -- that's the defense mechanism, it wanted to ease up.
Q.  Are you taking anything for it?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  No.  Just some ice, that's it.  Let the bruising heal.  It caught on top and bruised all around the pad, which is, you know, might force me to have a few days off.
Q.  Were you going to play next week?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  No.  I think six in a row is plenty.  No, it's a week off.
Q.  When you came down this morning how close were you to not playing?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  First of all, I tried putting it around with the thumb on the side of the grip, and I actually warmed up halfway through the bag with that.  But when I got to the longer clubs, that wasn't working so well.  And then I had practiced with the thumb off and the forefinger off as a drill; so after I hit a few shots I got reasonably comfortable with that.

The only thing is it obviously, that's where I struggled this morning.  You have to hit the ball easier and I was losing a bit of distance on my irons, and then when I hit one harder, I struggled with my distance selecting a club because I wasn't really sure how it was going to come out.  I wasn't sure if I could hit it hard or easy, and that made it tough in the morning.  Certainly a couple of errors were made there.
Q.  Was it harder with your irons or putting?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  It was awkward on the putting end.
Q.  Did it keep you awake last night?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  You know what, I took some Advil, I think I was more awake, every hour I woke up, is it okay.  I don't think I woke up because there was pain.  I was waking up to check, how was it moving.  But no, as I say, the pain was, it was only if I could function.
