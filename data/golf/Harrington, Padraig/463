Q.  2 under par through 14, everything looked to be going well, the short stick let you down, is that fair to say?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I think that's it.  I can't keep putting myself in these positions.  It was tough after the first rounds, it's a long way back now from where I am where I was going comfortably in the middle of the round, 2 under, and it was easy being 2 under.  It could have been a few more.

Obviously a difficult day ahead of me tomorrow.  If I play the same way as I played today, I'll need a very good day on the greens.
Q.  How frustrating to be hitting the ball this well on this golf course and not be getting what you serve?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I think I've struggled a bit with pace on the greens.  I think always expect the greens here to be that much quicker and with the moisture that's in them, they are not running out.  I'm just not getting my pace right.  I'm leaving myself some awkward putts back and if you keep doing that, you're going to miss some and when you start missing them, you lose a bit of confidence.  Just being a little bit off this week so far when it's come to some of my chip shots and some of my putts.
Q.  Has it been hard to keep the Order of Merit out of your mind?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I'm trying to win the tournament like I would be any week.  It's not like I need to finish Top 10 to win the Order of Merit or something.

I've got to go out there and win it and so I've been focusing on trying to do my best this week to get myself up near the top and be in contention, with nine holes to go, if you're in contention with nine holes to go, anything can happen.
Q.  Are you surprised to be as close to the lead as you are?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  I'm, what, four shots behind now at the moment, which is the same as what I went out.  It certainly isn't insurmountable, but when I was coasting along today at 2 under par and having nice putts for birdies and things, it was a lot easier prospect of winning this tournament than it is now.
Q.  It's possible that you finish second, Paul doesn't have a great day, you can still win the Order of Merit, will you be watching the boards and paying attention?
PADRAIG HARRINGTON:  No, just trying to win the tournament.  I've finished second a few times in my career.  Many times I've cursed that second position.  Yes, obviously tomorrow I would accept it at this moment, but then again, if I lost in a playoff tomorrow, I'd be good, so going out there trying to win the tournament.
