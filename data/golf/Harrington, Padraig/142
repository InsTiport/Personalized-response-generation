 Q.   Thoughts on the day?   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Didn't quite happen.   Yeah, you know, obviously disappointed to the extent that I wasn't going to win, but you know, 5‑under is not going to be very hard; if you play for second place, that would be‑‑ you know, but I don't play for second place so that's neither here nor there.   
Played well this week.   Lots of good things.   Lots of positive things.   
   
 Q.   You seem to be happy with your level of performance?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   Game is in good shape.   It really is.   So I can't complain about that.   You know, tidy up here and there, and I saw some nice Sparks.   I hit some nice chip shots towards the end of the week which I wasn't doing at the start of the week.   I see a lot of good things in my game.   Just try and stay patient.   You know, it's as good as it's ever been.   
   
 Q.   And Rory's achievement?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   At this stage, people could be saying I was right when I was saying he could challenge Jack.   
You've got to start when you're young; if you're going to win one a year, that's one each of the last two years.   So to get to Tiger's 14 or Jack's 18, you really do have to start doing it when you're in your early 20s, because you ain't going to be winning‑‑ as good as Tiger was, he proved that you're not‑‑ they don't come around as easy as people think they do.   
You know, it's prolific winning to win one a year, so he has another 20 years ahead of him, maybe 25 years of golf.  
   
 Q.   Taking 54‑hole lead and holding it, has not been an easy thing for guys this year.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   He's played lovely.   There's been nobody else in this really.   So it's fantastic play by him.   
You know, he's lapped the field twice now.   That's two tournaments he's lapped the field.   He nearly did it in another one.   Not many guys‑‑ you know, what the only person that's ever done that in majors in my time has been, you know, Tiger.   He's done it twice now.   I don't know how many times Tiger did it.   That's quite impressive, isn't it.   
   
 Q.   Does anyone drive the ball longer, straighter, higher than him?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   I think if you looked at the stats, there's quite a few.   
   
 Q.   Would you say it's his best club in the bag?   He loves the driver.   
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   He certainly lives by it.   You know, when he's on form with that driver, he gains a lot of confidence driving the ball well, that's for sure.   He likes to‑‑ when he's driving it well‑‑ he seems to play his best when he's driving it well.   It sets him up for the rest of his game, and he does drive it magnificent, there's no doubt about that.   
   
 Q.   How good is Rory?  
PÃDRAIG HARRINGTON:   You know, I said two years ago, when he lost at the Masters, that he could challenge Jack's record.   And now he's won one each of the last two years.
