 Q.   Talk about your round today.   How did the round go?  
MATT JONES:   It was good.   I had 6‑under, had a good first nine, and then I had one bad tee shot, which ended up making double, but then I fought back with three birdies after that which was good.   
And then finished with a birdie on the last.   
So I'm a long way behind, but still, first tournament of the year, it's good to be in this position.   
   
 Q.   Did you go in the water?  
MATT JONES:   I did.   I just hit a terrible tee shot.   I hit it in the water and then missed an 8 bogey putt.   
   
 Q.   And do you want to talk about your last birdie.   
MATT JONES:   Yeah.   I hit a good tee shot, I hit a wedge in there to about 10 feet below the hole and it was a pretty straight putt and pretty quick.   All you had to do was get it going and it was going in.   It was a good way to finish.   
   
 Q.   Do you think anybody can catch Reed?  
MATT JONES:   I honestly‑‑ there's a long way to go.   We're the first group in, so there's a lot of golf still out there to be played for the rest of the guys.   And who knows how up to date the score boards are on this course.   So, I don't know what he's at, and what other guys are at behind him.   So, I'll see what it is at the end of the round.  
   
 Q.   He's 26 under and I think you're 17‑under.   So do you think you can catch him, I guess?  
MATT JONES:   I would have to have‑‑ he would have to have a bad day tomorrow.   So it would be very, very tough.   
   
 Q.   Even though it's early in the year and you want to play well, and you know there's a lot of birdies and you have to keep your foot on the gas out here.   What happens when you hit that ball in the water, mentally?   Do you just reset?  
MATT JONES:   Nothing.   
   
 Q.   And kick yourself for it?  
MATT JONES:   It was my fault.   I should have backed off, but I still swung when I wasn't ready and I just‑‑ I knew that we had multiple birdie holes coming in and I still had three.   I birdied the next three holes, so I knew I could get the shots back.   
But out here you can't really afford to lose those shots as you can see by the scores.   
   
 Q.   Do you reset and just go, okay, just put that one behind you as quick as you can?  
MATT JONES:   Yeah.   That's what I did.   And if you don't, then I wouldn't have birdied the next three.   If I held it with me, I probably would have made more mistakes and compounded the error.   So it's good not to.  
   
 Q.   Usually the first tournament of the year you're trying to knock a little rust off.   But, you're obviously not knocking any rust off.   
MATT JONES:   Oh, I would say there is some rust, but it's going well.   I'm making some putts, which is nice to do.   And I'm going to have to do that tomorrow as well.
