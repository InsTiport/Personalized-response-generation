 Q.  You got on a little bit of a roll out there.  And really a flurry of a finish with you with a birdie on 18.  
MATT JONES: Yeah, I missed about a 3-footer on my second hole.  But then there was four in a row.   
 Q.  That birdie on 18, a sweet way to finish the game.  
MATT JONES: It was.  Considering with the second shot, it's not the nicest of greens.  To get up and down was great there.   
 Q.  Did the course change much?  
MATT JONES: No, the wind was a little swirly, not a lot of wind out there.  Very playable, very scorable.  I'm sure you're going to see some low scores this afternoon.   
 Q.  You've had really good form the last couple of weeks.  Any reason for the turnaround?  
MATT JONES: No, not at all.  Probably putting better than I have.  If I can get it for four rounds I'll be very close up on the weekend.
