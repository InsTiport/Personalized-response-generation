 Q.  How did it all play out for you from your perspective?  
MATT JONES: I felt like I played well early on, and then got a little loose on the last four or five holes.  Could have been a better score, but I'll take it, I've still got a chance tomorrow, I still have to play well.   
 Q.  What do you take from the day when it is a little bit up and down but you're still able to get in with a good score?  
MATT JONES: You take what you can.  You take the positives.  I'll take the first 9, 12 holes where I had good birdie putts, missed a few, made a couple.  I've got to go tighten things up on the range and I'll be ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  What do you look forward to the most heading into the final round with a chance to win?  
MATT JONES: Just having a chance to win.  Anytime I have that chance is great.  And I've had a few chances and I want to do it again.
