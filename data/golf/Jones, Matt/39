  THE MODERATOR:   Well.   Let's welcome Matt Jones into the media center here at the Puerto Rico Open.   Matt, good playing out there in what we have been told were some windy conditions.   Can you tell us, what were the keys to your round today? 
MATT JONES:   Keys were ball striking, I think.   I had unbelievable ball striking.   I think I was pinâ€‘high every hole except 17, when I wanted to be a bit short of it, then I made good putts, had a good eagle on 1 to get started and had a great day. 
THE MODERATOR:   Your year so far, how would you categorize how you've been playing? 
MATT JONES:   This is my third event, maybe the fourth, I've been making adjustments.   My putting was terrible last year and at the start of this year, and I worked hard on it last week and finally figured it out so I feel normal like I did in 2010. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions? 

Q.   How are you feeling today? 
MATT JONES:   Good.   I hit it great, feel great, everything felt really great. 
My chipping and putting I've been working hard on and that's been amazing all week, so I knew if I didn't hit it great I had that to fall back on today and all this week, so I was happy. 

Q.   The wind was a factor today? 
MATT JONES:   It was.   It was very windy, just had to judge it right, and my caddy and I talked it out and we hit the shots and executed them. 

Q.   Did you expect to hit 65? 
MATT JONES:   You never know, you hope so!   You hit it how you know you can hit it, sure.   But, I mean, it's a good start, I'm happy to be where I am, and hopefully I can build on it tomorrow. 

Q.   (Away from mic.)
MATT JONES:   The greens?   They were soft, yeah.   Yeah, you could stop it pretty quick.   Depends, into the grain they stopped down grain and still bounced out a little, so you've got to know what the grain is doing on the greens. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Matt.
