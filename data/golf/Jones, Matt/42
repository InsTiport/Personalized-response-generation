   MATT JONES: Hit a couple of balls. 16 was a bogey. I came out and hit a bad tee shot. But 18 I hit a drive how I wanted, second shot where I wanted, and third shot I must have just squeezed it a little and went a little long and made a bogey. 
 But I'm in contention, so I'm happy with where I'm at.

 Q. If conditions stay the way they are now, obviously low scores are all over the board, do you like your positioning for tomorrow? 
 MATT JONES: I'm happy. Within 2 is great. I think that's where I'm at. Webb's at 12. So I'll be in position tomorrow. So just give myself a chance coming down the stretch.

 Q. You were the only one of the golfers to birdie 12 today. Are you surprised? Was that playing tough? 
 MATT JONES: Yeah, it was straight into the wind. I hit a bad tee shot and pulled it into the left bunker. I hit a great 5-iron to two or three feet.

 Q. That was out of the bunker? 
 MATT JONES: Yeah.
