 Q.   You're still in contention, does it feel good to be where you're at?  
    MATT JONES:   Yeah, I played very well today, putted great.   I had one bad hole, but other than that it was still‑‑ it's going to happen on that hole.  
    I played well and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Three days in a row with the wind.   Are you getting used to it, is it taking its toll, is it beating you guys up?  
    MATT JONES:   It's a grind.   You can't have any time off on this golf course.   It's always there.   If you make one mistake that can turn into a double.   The wind has been consistent.  
   
 Q.   Is it a guessing game, though, too, partly, because the guys are talking about you hope you guess right?  
    MATT JONES:   Oh, it definitely is.   Hopefully you can get the right wind.  
   
 Q.   On 16, 17 and 18, how tough are these finishing holes here?  
    MATT JONES:   16 is extremely tough.   17 and 18, they're tough, but you can still hit a 2‑iron, 9‑iron.   If you play them right, you can still make good scores.   But if you hit a bad tee shot, you can make a big number.  
   
 Q.   Heading into tomorrow, just your thoughts?  
    MATT JONES:   I'm going to stick to my game plan.   I hit 3 drivers on every round.   2‑irons and 3‑woods off the tees.
