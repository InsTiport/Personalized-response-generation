Q.   Tell me about how you played today and how you feel about your position heading into the final round. 
MATT JONES:   I made more putts than the first two days. 

Q.   Quite a volatile front nine.   Only three pars. 
MATT JONES:   Really?   I didn't even know that.   Yeah, it was good. 
I got off to a tough start.   I hit my second shot in a bad spot and made a good 10‑footer for par on the first hole and from there on just, I didn't know I had that many pars, so it was a good day.

Q.   Were these the toughest conditions of the week?
MATT JONES:   By far.   The greens are starting to firm up and speed up a lot, too.   So you definitely got to hit it in the fairway, so you can control the ball on the greens.

Q.   Is that about the best you could have done today, 3‑under?
MATT JONES:   Yeah.   For the way ‑‑ I didn't strike it ass a good as I could have.   So I'll take 3‑under.

Q.   You're four shots off the lead, is that close enough?
MATT JONES:   Out here, definitely.   Especially those finishing holes.   There's plenty of holes that can get you, but there's plenty of holes out there that you can make birdie on as well. 
If you play a good round tomorrow, 5 or 6‑under, we'll see what happens.
