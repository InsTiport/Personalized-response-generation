 Q.   Malt, you gave it a run.   You were stuck on 12 and 13 for most of the front-9 but nice run on the back, three birdies in a row.  
MATT JONES:   The front-9 done me in two days in a row.   Played little better, a whole different story.   Probably the second shot into 4 when I hit it, just hit a terrible shot.   Put me a bit back and ended up having a good finish.  
   
 Q.   Did you know where you stood in the fairway --  
MATT JONES:   Yes.   It changed my whole shot selection knowing that he -- knowing to eagle from the distance it was wasn't going to happen.   I didn't want to throw away a good golf tournament by being aggressive and making a double bogey.   I hit a 3-wood off the tee.   I left myself too far.  
   
 Q.   How do you think you handled the pressure? With what the lead was, you had to make some birdies.   How did you handle the backside?   
MATT JONES:   I played well.   Scored well.   That's the most important thing.   Made some putts and felt good out there and comfortable and something I can build on.  
   
 Q.   This has to put you in great frame of mind.  
MATT JONES:   Yeah, two weeks I defend in Houston, actually.   But no, it's fine.   It does.   I worked hard this week with my coach who came over from Australia and seem to play well when he's around.   It's probably something I should keep having him come over.
