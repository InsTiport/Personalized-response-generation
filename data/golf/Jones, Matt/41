 Q. 7:19 is early to get up for a tee time in Vegas?
 MATT JONES: It is, especially on jet-lag coming from Australia. 

 Q. When did you get in?
 MATT JONES: Sunday. And my daughter was up at 2:30 this morning, so been having a bit of a tough time sleeping. But no, seemed to work out well so might have to do it more often.

 Q. Tough first nine for you but you really got it going on the second nine?
 MATT JONES: First nine, score-wise, I hit it unbelievably but I didn't make a putt on the front nine. Hit it the same on the back nine, made a few putts and ended up with a good score.

 Q. Talk about the iron play, none of the birdies on the back nine were outside of 15 feet. You were hitting it close?
 MATT JONES: Yeah, I was. I hit it very good today. Been working hard with my coach. Actually went back home to Australia for three weeks and probably the hardest I've worked on my game for a long time, brought him back over here and starting to pay off. 

 Q. You know your back is against the wall so you have to make something happen, right?
 MATT JONES: It's not where I want to be, but four events to get a win and then we'll go from there.

 Q. This is one of those tournaments, you've been here before, where you've got to shoot 65, and now go do it again?
 MATT JONES: 65, you have to do it every round out here by the looks of it to have a chance to win. 65 is good but tomorrow I'll probably be 6- or 7- back starting my second round. 

 Q. Golf course, a little longer or a little more or less spin going into the greens? 
 MATT JONES: The greens, some of them are and some aren't. They changed one par 5 to a par 4, which I'm not sure they did last year. It's a little longer. I hit driver, sand wedge into 18, which the practice round I hit driver, 9-iron. So it's a little firmer.
