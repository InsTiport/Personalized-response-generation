MATT JONES: You got off to a good start, a couple of birdies early, couple of putts that went in to get the round started and hit a lot of good quality shots down there.  It was good to finish with a birdie on the last one today.  A 4 feels like a birdie.   
 Q.  Only one blemish on the card.  Did you feel the conditions were a factor or your game was coming into form?  
MATT JONES: It wasn't as windy on the front nine, it wasn't bad.  It was very playable.  The last few holes, it got really windy out there on the back nine.  No. 9 is just a tough hole, especially with a wind off to the left.  There's nowhere to miss that green.  If you miss it -- I just couldn't get up and down.   
 Q.  Only the first round, what do you think going into the rest?  Is this a good confidence boost?  
MATT JONES: Oh, of course.  Anytime you start off with a good round, especially in a major championship, it's great.  There's not going to be a lot of great scores this afternoon.   
I see Dustin at 6, I'm at 4.  I'm not sure if anyone else is in there.  If anyone else shoots 4-under this afternoon, they've played a hell of a round.
