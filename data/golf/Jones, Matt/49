 Q. Couple real quick. Obviously still right in the thick of it at the top of the leaderboard. Thoughts on 36 holes tomorrow.
 MATT JONES: Today was a battle off the tee on some tee shots. I hit a couple of left shots that managed to not play myself out of the tournament, still in there and still have the lead, which is nice. 
 So 36 holes is going to be a long day on this golf course mentally moreso than physically. So if I can keep control of my mental side of things and play, let everything else happen, I should be all right.
