Q.   Matt, what a great way to start this tournament, five birdies, no bogies for you.   How were you able to do it today in the first around?
MATT JONES:   I just hit the greens and had to get used to the speed out there.   Greens are quick, very firm actually when I first started so I had to adjust after the first and second hole seeing how the ball was bouncing up.
I kept it in play on missing greens and chipping on these greens is pretty tough around these greens because I'm not used to the bermuda rough and all that, too.

Q.   You could feel the wind swirling a little bit here and there.   It comes up and dies down. 
MATT JONES:   It got me a couple times, yeah.   On 14, the second shot, it was downwind but then when I hit it, it was into the wind.   Came 10, 15 yards short.   It's going to be like that all day.

Q.   You look back at the round, what were the shots that stand out in your mind to keep it going?
MATT JONES:   Just the putter.   To start with I had probably two 30, 35 footers, big putts and I made a couple three foot par putts to keep it alive.   Stayed even and made a good birdie on the first par 5 to get my round going.

Q.   Matt, when you get off to a great start like you did on Thursday, what kind of frame of mind does that put you in for the rest of the event?
MATT JONES:   It's always good to get off to a good start.   I knew with the quality field this week 5-under is a good round but it's not going to do a lot if you don't keep it going.   There's a lot of good players.   I'm going to have to keep playing well.

Q.   What was working for your game not only on Thursday but maybe coming into Greensboro?
MATT JONES:   My putting.   At the PGA last week I didn't feel that great.   My short game really saved me, chipping and putting. 
Today was the same way.   I didn't hit it as close as I would like.   Getting up to the start I hit a few 30-foot putts and these greens are really quick and can get away from you quickly.   I was able to hole a couple of three-footers to keep the round going.

Q.   There are a lot of guys who are on the bubble dealing with not only trying to get to The Playoff events but trying to keep their card.   You have been through those experiences.   You've had a good season.   You don't have to worry about that.   How much has that freed you up headed into this event?
MATT JONES:   It has but my only goal right now is get Top 30 or a win.   I've definitely been there before.   I think I finished 126th and 127th before out here so I know what they're going through.   It's not a comfortable feeling but it does free me up that I can go and be aggressive.

Q.   So, of course, you got to try to get in it early before the weather comes in and trying to score well.   Just go over your round and are you surprised by your play?
MATT JONES:   No, I'm not surprised.   I actually haven't played too well here previously but I went with a different game plan today. 
Previously I've hit a lot more drivers than I did today.   I think I only hit one driver today and that was on No. 5, the first par 5. 
So I changed my game plan around just to keep it in play.   These greens are so hard and fast out there now that you have to be able to control your ball.   You won't be able to have any chance out of rough.

Q.   You'll stick with it throughout the week?
MATT JONES:   Yes.   It's going to be a lot of 2-irons and 3-woods for me.   Let my putter and short game do the work.

Q.   The bigger names start to tee off about a half hour.   So you put it up and now they have a number to go for.   What are your thoughts on that?
MATT JONES:   It's just a number.   I mean the number after the first round is always good but there's three more rounds to go.   I mean I've got to keep going.   If I don't play well tomorrow, then no one will know what I did the first day.   This game is very -- memory is going to be very short this game.   You have to play well continually.

Q.   What is it going to take to keep momentum going for you going into tomorrow's round?
MATT JONES:   Keeping the ball in the fairway and on the greens.   I'm putting really well.   If I keep putting well, I'll be fine.
