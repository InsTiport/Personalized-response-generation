  Q. What do you think of your chances?  
 MATT JONES: Well, I'm just playing right now, looks like, to play my way into the British Open and play my way into the PGA.   
 Stricker is nine in front of me, so you'd have to have something miraculous happen from him. That's not going to happen the way he's playing, so my goal now is to play for second.  
  
  Q. Is that a frustration?  
 MATT JONES: Not at all. I mean I'm playing well. I'm doing what I can do, and he's just playing better. There's nothing you can do about it.  
  
  Q. Is it kind of fun just you against the course now, too? Does it kind of take an element away when one guy's kind of running away with it?  
 MATT JONES: It's always that way, you against the course, and especially on this golf course. It's there to be had if you're hitting well, putting well. So we'll just see what the conditions bring tomorrow and see how we do.  
  
  Q. You still going to try and get into those two majors?  
 MATT JONES: It would be great. I've only played in one major, and that was the U.S. Open at Bethpage, and I had to withdraw after 27 holes because I herniated a disk in my back, so that was disappointing. So it would be nice to get into another.  
  
  Q. Is this about as well as you've played? Do you feel about the strongest now?  
 MATT JONES: It was the first two days. Today wasn't. I didn't feel as good as I did yesterday and the day before, but I'll go work a few things on the range and see what happens.  
  
  Q. You guys are all competitors, but do you ever stop and marvel at each other's accomplishments?  
 MATT JONES: Oh, every golfer is happy to see other golfers do well, and when Steve's shooting what he is, it's great to see. It's great for the TOUR, and it's great for public interest.  
  
  Q. Matt, as a 30-year-old, what's it like to see these three guys who are in their 40s up there on top?  
 MATT JONES: Everyone's good out here. You wouldn't be on the PGA TOUR if you weren't. And I've got 10 more years, so hopefully I can still do what they're doing at 40.
