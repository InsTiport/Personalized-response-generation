   MATT JONES: My driver, if I can get that better, then a win might come shortly.

 Q. You hit a big drive on 18 and missed a fairway to the right, looks like you're hitting it good. 
 MATT JONES: If it gets better, I'll be happy and something good will happen.
 My caddie and I worked well together and it's coming together, a few cuts in a row and maybe make a Top-5 or something later on. 

 Q. Talk about today and being in contention. 
 MATT JONES: I don't know if I was in contention that much. I felt back to 11 after the fifth hole and birdied 7 and 8 to get me back to 13. 
 I knew the back nine was scoring nice, so if I can just get around the front nine, I knew I would have a chance to do well on the back nine. 

 Q. Your game back on track? 
 MATT JONES: I wouldn't say it's back on track, no. My driver is far from on track. My putting is coming back.
