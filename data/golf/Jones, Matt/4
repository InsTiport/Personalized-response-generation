Q. Heck of a way to end a long day for you.
MATT JONES: Yeah, it was a long day.  It was a day that could have been worse but could have been better, too.  I'm pretty happy with where I am.  I played nicely.  Nothing great, but just managed my game and made some putts out there, which was nice.
Q. How much of a grind was it today with the stops and starts?
MATT JONES: I mean, it is what it is.  You get used to it.  This is your job, so you get used to all types of weather conditions and stop/starts.
It was actually nice that storm came through.  It cooled everything down a lot, which was quite beneficial.
Q. What do you think the conditions will be like tomorrow?
MATT JONES: I'm assuming a lot like today:  hot and humid.  I actually haven't seen the forecast.  I don't think there will be weather, so we'll be in twosomes, which will be nice.
Q. Seem to be real close to the Matt Jones we saw not too long ago.  I'm sure a lot of hard work to get back there.  What are you most encouraged about?
MATT JONES: Probably the way I'm putting.  Ball-striking is always good enough for me.  It's golf.  We're not going to hit it great every time.  When you're putting well it saves you so many times during a round.
I haven't been able to make those par putts to keep a round going or make a birdie to get a round going.  I've definitely done that this week, and hopefully there is another round in me.
Q. With how Michael is playing out there right now, do you have a number in mind for tomorrow?  Do you worry about anything like that?
MATT JONES: I think he was at 19 the last you saw.  I haven't see what he's at.  He might be at 20; could be 121.  I have no idea.
But, no, I hope I'm in the final group with him tomorrow.  I don't know how I stand, if I'm second, third, I'm not sure.  I mean, this course, everyone is going to go low.
I know playing in the final group and being a leader you're always a bit edgy.  I know he's going to be a little more uncomfortable, and everyone else is going to be trying to have as many birdies as they can to catch him.
