Q. The putter, which you have in your hand right now, red hot.  I would sleep with that thing tonight?
MATT JONES: Yeah, I've been actually doing a lot of work on my putting in my hotel room at night, and it paid off today.  It's probably the best putting day I've had in four years.
It's probably been my Achilles' heel the last few years, so it was nice to make some putts.
Q. Yeah, over double the length of putts you had in round one.  Only 22 putts; 30 on your inward nine.  Were you racing to get the last putt in as clouds were coming in?
MATT JONES: Yeah, it's very dark.  I didn't realize it was as close as it is, but I'm very happy to be finished.
Now I'm going to go try and recover a little, because it was an unbelievably hot, long day today.
Q. How did you manage today?  A lot fluids?
MATT JONES: Yeah.  Copious amounts of fluids, and I'm sick of water right now.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
MATT JONES: No, I have a laser in there that I put on my shaft, and it makes a straight line go along like the line of your putter.  If that stays straight, my face and path are perfectly matched up.
If that gets off, then you'll see the face will open and up the laser will go out to the right.  If it's closed, laser will go left.  If it keeps it straight, it's good.  It's been working.
