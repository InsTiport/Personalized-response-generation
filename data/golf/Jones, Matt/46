  Q. Good day, considering the conditions, the rain, the wind, the cold, pretty good day for you.  
 MATT JONES: Yeah. It was a battle out there to start with. It was cold, got a bit wet, but I'm happy with 68.  
  
  Q. I saw you had the birdie there on the last hole, but the rain really was coming down. Did that bother you at all?  
 MATT JONES: It was -- I would have liked to have, yeah, had an umbrella over me or something. But I didn't get that. But it's still fine.  
  
  Q. Do you feel any pressure coming into this event? You've been so close, barely missed out in the PLAYOFFS. 123 right now. You know you have to play well. Is there any pressure or are you just going about your business?  
 MATT JONES: No. If I do what I know I can do, it won't be any problem. It's just a matter of me putting two rounds and then four rounds together. Last week I got off to a great start and then had a tough second day, so just have to come out here tomorrow and play well and see what happens.  
  
  Q. Did the weather catch you off guard?  
 MATT JONES: No. I knew the forecast. I actually didn't expect it to be this cold, though. I haven't played in weather this cold for a long time, so it was a little different.  
  
  Q. Well, keep playing well. You played well today.  
 MATT JONES: Thank you.   
  
  Q. Matt, just a bit more on your season. Are you still feeling pretty comfortable? You haven't had your best year, but you're still in there, so you've gotta be comfortable.  
 MATT JONES: Yeah. I've played actually pretty -- I've played terrible after the PLAYERS. I think I missed every cut, maybe made one. And to still be Top 125 right now is good, but it also tells you that you shouldn't be in this situation right now either.   
 But three weeks left to do well and go from there.
