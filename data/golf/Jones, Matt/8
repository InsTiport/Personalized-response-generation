Q. Matt, well done out there today.  I know that bogey at 18 stings a little bit but tough conditions out there today.  Solid playing.  How difficult was it?
MATT JONES: It was different.  I don't think it was that difficult.  There's a lot of room off the tee.  You control your irons and give yourself a look at it, you can do it.  I could have shot a low score.  I missed a lot of putts for birdie.
Q. Little unlucky, 13 and 14, didn't drop.  How different did the golf course play from yesterday?
MATT JONES: It's a lot different.  This is what the course is built for.  Just today was a lot different than other days.  I hope to play well tomorrow, which will be good.
Q. You got your first win on the PGA TOUR in Texas.  Good luck tomorrow.
MATT JONES: Have to have a really good round and see what the leaders will do.  It will take a low one.  I don't know if they'll come back.
