Q. That birdie finish there on 18. Take us through it.
MATT JONES: Yeah, it's not the funnest hole right now with that wind. I hit a tee shot in the right bunker, landed up into a good spot and then didn't hit a very good wedge, but was able to chip in and finish the round off well.
Q. You talked about that not being such a fun hole. Was it really even a fun day out there considering the conditions?
MATT JONES: There's not a lot of fun holes, especially when you make the turn and get to 11. You make some birdies out on the front nine, but when you get to 11 and you go all the way through here, it's a battle and I think the scores would suggest that.
Q. We'll see how it all shakes out, but that birdie on 18 could get you a top-5 here. What does that mean for you?
MATT JONES: It's fantastic. I've had a good year. I've had good years here in the past and it's a tournament I think I have a good chance of winning and top-5 is good and it helps boost me up in the FedExCup and that's what we want.
