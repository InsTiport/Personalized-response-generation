  MARK STEVENS:   Just talk about the conditions out there today and some specifics on wind and rain. 
WADE STETTNER:   There's some thunderstorms this morning up near Stuart and Port St. Lucie, and they were up there at 6:00 AM.   It took all the way until afternoon till they got down to Palm Beach County, striking here, hitting here after 1:00 PM. 
Obviously we had some very heavy rainfall.   Radar estimates are about 3 1/2 inches right now and it continues to add on.   We did have a brief period of heavy winds during the storms.   Wind gusts estimated at 60 miles per hour here at the golf course, and right now, everything is very flooded out there. 

Q.   What's the forecast for overnight and into tomorrow?   Do you see a window where we'll be able to get back out in the morning?
WADE STETTNER:   Yeah, we're going to see some steady rain continuing into the evening hours.   Should finally taper off after about 9:00, 10:00 PM tonight.   Generally dry overnight. 
When we come in Sunday morning, there's about a 30percent chance of some scattered showers before noon, and it looks like things clear up for the afternoon.   We'll reassess when we come in in the morning, but right now we have a favorable forecast to be able to play golf, assuming that the golf course is ready to go by 7:00 am tomorrow morning.
