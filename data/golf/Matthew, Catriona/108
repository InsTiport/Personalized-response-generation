   BETHAN CUTLER:  I'd like to welcome Iben Tinning from Denmark and Catriona Matthew from Scotland for the 2007 Solheim Cup.  You're making your fourth appearance in this competition.  Start by saying how it feels to be back here again. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, it's fantastic to be back here.  This is probably one of the best events you can play in so professionally.  It's just great fun, the atmosphere and the crowd.  It's just a great week. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  Iben, how about you? 
 IBEN TINNING:  I've got the same to say as Catriona, but it's just that I'm kind of waiting to get the same atmosphere as we had before, that whole week, have the same here where everybody was, you know, applauding for everybody, not just us, but for the Americans as well.  I think that's a great thing to show. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  You think it's a good atmosphere? 
 IBEN TINNING:  I think so.  We're so busy with everything else, but I think we all enjoy each  other's company.  I definitely am. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  We really had one dinner together so far.  So yeah, everything seems to be going well. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  How did you find the course?  Did you only play nine holes this morning? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Played 18.  It's in fantastic shape.  The greens are just perfect.  Still maybe a little wet, but I think another couple days, it should dry.  The front nine is pretty long.  Again, if it dries out, you should get a little more roll but certainly in good shape. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  Iben, how about you? 
 IBEN TINNING:  I think the same.  I think it's definitely playing long, but I guess we can handle that. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  What about the Europeans versus the U.S. team in terms of distance? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think we probably got a few more longer hitters, Laura, Sophie, Mimi, Suzann.  And Bett, who is kind of on the same level as Laura and Sophie.  At the end of the day, you got to still get it in the hole but certainly maybe a little bit longer. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  We'll take some questions. 

 Q.  What do you think?  The Americans are favorites on paper, but what are you thinking? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I would say on paper.  I mean, by the world rankings certainly they're favorites, but having it over here, they -- it's a big help to us over here.  A lot of their players have never played in Europe.  They'll end a lot different than it was at Crooked Stick.  So I think that's a big plus on our side. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  Helen seems to be jumping around.  How are you finding her as a captain? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Full of energy. 
 (Laughter.) 
IBEN TINNING:  She's been brilliant so far.  We're going to have a great week, lot of fun.  I think maybe more fun.  She's got so much energy and always happy, smiling, positive.  What more do you need in a captain?  I think she's doing good. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  Okay. 

 Q.  Catriona, it's been a month since you won at Scandinavia.  If I'm correct, you've played in one tournament since then.  Do you feel you're able to continue the form that you displayed in Sweden this week? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I would say so.  I played quite a lot of golf up until Sweden.  I had a couple weeks off, and I think it was important to go and play at the Rail last week, the week before just to get another tournament in.  But, yeah, I mean, I feel good with how I played. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  You got your children with you or back at home? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Katrina is here and your cousin, little playmate soon. 
 BETHAN CUTLER:  Great.  Any more questions?  Okay. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thank you. 
 IBEN TINNING:  Thanks.
