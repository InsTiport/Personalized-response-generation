Q.   Your play has gotten you into the top 10.   Can you talk about your day out there today?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Yeah, I played really well today.   I drove the ball better than I've driven it the first two days.   It was tough to get the ball close so birdies were few and far between.   So I just have to try to keep making birdies.

Q.   (Inaudible) (Asking about driving the ball). 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Oh, a big factor.   I think it's windier today than it was yesterday, and they've moved the tees a little further back.   So it played pretty tough out there today.

Q.   How about putting out there with this wind?   Was that a factor? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Oh, it's not too bad, not too bad with putting.

Q.   What are you going to do the rest of the day? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I'm going to get a massage (Inaudible).

Q.   What do you think is the best thing you've seen for yourself in this tournament so far? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Well, being in 10th place after three rounds is quite good.
