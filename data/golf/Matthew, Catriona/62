 Q.   (Inaudible) how did you get that done?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   It's definitely an up‑and‑down day out there today.   Pars are good scores.   The first two rounds I only had nine pars, so a lot of birdies and lot of bogeys.   
(Inaudible) and get it close.   Just a lot more solid, consistent day today.  
   
 Q.   What would you say overall in this competition your best game has been?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Today, definitely.   I didn't get in trouble off the tee.   So you have got to keep it in play off the tee.   Like I said, you have got to hit the greens when you can.   
The key to a U.S. Open ‑‑ you know, a lot of them you don't even try hit greens.   You have got to miss it in the right spots.   After playing this course the last two days, you realize the places that you don't want to be.   We did a lot better with the game plan there today and really missing in the right spots and taking the birdie opportunities when they came.
