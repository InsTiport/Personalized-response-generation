 Q. Give us your thoughts on your round. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I mean, nothing from probably 12 on. I struggled a little bit, didn't hit that many good shots. Chipped and putted well but didn't give myself enough birdie chances coming in.

 Q. Were you aware of the leaderboard situation?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I knew where I was standing.

 Q. And what about 18?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, it was just a tempting eye there. Tried to hit a little 5-iron and the ball was just a little bit above my feet. In hindsight I should have chipped out but decided to go for it. 

 Q. Talk about how you're feeling after your final round here. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, obviously a bit disappointed. I played well going out but struggled a little bit coming in, didn't give myself enough chances.

 Q. How did you find the conditions of the course today compared to the rest of the week?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, there was just a little bit more breeze today, which made it a little bit more challenging.

 Q. And overall how did you find the course? Did you think it was worthy of having a British Open?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Oh, definitely, it's one of the best courses that there is. Yeah, everyone has enjoyed their week here, and look forward to coming back again. 

 Q. Obviously 18 was a case of just --
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: No, I thought it looked like a decent lie. The ball was just a little bit above my feet. I tried to hit a little 5-iron in there and just pulled it. Obviously looking back I should have laid up, but I didn't. 

 Q. Not quite the round you wanted today, but other than that --
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: No, I just had no chance. If I had just hit a couple of better shots just kind of around about 12 to 14, I was kind of right in there to maybe put a bit of pressure on her. 

 Q. How good is five majors at age 22?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, that's amazing. I've played with her a bit this year, and she's a great player, hits the ball strong and straight, and if she putts well she's hard to beat. 

 Q. Talk about the crowd support today. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, it was great seeing so many people out there and cheering me on. Instead of cheering my birdies they kept cheering my par saves. 

 Q. That was a good one at 10. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I holed a nice putt there actually. 

 Q. General reflections on the week? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I'd say at the moment disappointed with the way I finished, but I think overall not too bad a week.
