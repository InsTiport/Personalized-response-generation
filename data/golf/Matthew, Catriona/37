CATRIONA MATTHEW: I played really well today.  I hit 17 greens and hit quite a few inside 20 feet and gave myself some good birdie chances.
Q. What does it mean to look at this course as an old school course?  How many times have you seen courses like this?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think we were just saying that coming down the last in our group, there's no hole that you think is an easy hole.  Every hole is a challenge.  So you've just got to -- it's kind of like fishing.  You have to stay patient and try to hit fairways and give yourself a chance.  I think the key is trying to drive the ball.
Q. Seeing a round like you had today, do you feel the scores are really out there?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I mean if you play well the scores are out there.  But I think the scores today will be pretty similar to yesterday.  It's just a tough golf course.  I just played well today.
Q. How do you take this and play well again tomorrow?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Hopefully do the same again tomorrow.  If I can just drive the ball well, it gives yourself some chances to get some shots in close.
