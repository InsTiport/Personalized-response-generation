Q.  Congratulations.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thanks very much.
Q.  Winning in a playoff, you had a bogey free round today and birdied 17 to force the playoff.  Take us through the first playoff hole, and we'll take some questions.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  The first playoff hole, I hit a good drive.  It was 185 to the hole, which was a little longer.  It came down nicely, and it was quite a big.

And I hit what I thought was a great putt, and it went straight to the edge.  I wasn't really watching Hee Won putt, but I could hear the crowd.
Q.  How far was the first putt?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: The first putt was probably 15 feet.
Q.  Catriona, tell us about how you feel winning for the first time in a couple years, winning the championship.
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Just absolutely delighted.  I don't think it's quite sunk in yet.  I played well the last few years, but haven't managed to win.  To kind of hold it together and come out with the win, it's fantastic.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I played pretty well all the way around.  I missed the one green.  I putted well.  That was probably the difference this week.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, obviously I felt Patricia and Lorena would do well.  I was watching to see what they finished on.  Obviously Hee Won birdied 13, I think it was.  I had to try to make some birdies.  I tried to hit the greens and keep hoping the putts would go in, and I managed to do that.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Not particularly.  It was the first playoff I have been in.  It was kind of, like I said, I was trying to get myself ready.  I was kind of trying to keep calm.
Q.  You played pretty well in Toledo, and do you feel like your game this year is getting better?  Is it improving or do you feel right now you're pretty comfortable?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I feel     I think I'm trying to putt better.  This week, like I said, I managed to putt well.  I think that was the difference.
Q.  You're a Veteran of this tour.  How do you feel about Michelle Wie being out here?  You had a great Solheim Cup.  Do you feel like you've flown a little bit under the radar and your game is not appreciated as much?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Not so much appreciated, but I haven't won as much.  It was great to win this week.  Michelle, she's a great player.  She brings in the crowd.  I think she'll be a great draw for the LPGA.
Q.  Can you expand a little bit on that answer?  Has it just come down to, as you said, not making enough putts?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: There is always    you know, I've got myself into position sometimes and got a little nervous or tried a little too hard and hit a bad shot.  There is so many good players.  This week, I kept it on the greens and didn't put that much pressure on myself to get up and down.  I tried to stay patient and hoped I would do good.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yes.
Q.  Can you talk about having your husband on the bag?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: My husband caddied for me.  It's great having him on the bag, makes it all the more special.
Q.  Can you take us over your scorecard.

(Scorecard read.)
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: It's just kind of a scary hole.  It was a very short par 3, but the greens are shallow, and the water up front.  It's very easy to hit it over the back, and you have to lay up a chip.
Q.  Does this feel like any kind of a break through that you can take this win and run with it?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: A little bit.  The last time I won was a long time ago.  I have played well since then but not won.
Q.  How did you     when you said you looked at the board and saw Patricia and Lorena, you told yourself to make the birdie, but you also told yourself to be patient.  How do you do that?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: My husband told me, just play patient.  I kind of stuck to my game plan and hoped that I would get a couple putts in.  It's difficult to stay patient, but I have been there enough times now that I'm learning.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I knew it was going to be playing long, and it was going to be a difficult hole to birdie, so I knew I was going to have a better chance on 17 to make birdie than probably 18.
Q.  What is your history at this tournament?  Have you played it every year?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I played this course the first time last year.
Q.  Other than winning here now, any reason you like the course?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: This played well for me off the tee.  I think I hit it fairly long, so it gives you a lot of birdie chances.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, that's definitely an advantage.
Q.  Speaking of which, how many yards did you have on Hee Won on the playoff hole on the drive?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: About 20 yards.
Q.  What did you say you hit in?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I hit like a 3 iron, my rescue club.
Q.  Do you have a special way of celebrating this win?  Do you have anything planned?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: We're actually driving to Pennsylvania tonight.  I'm delaying the celebration tonight.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Not the whole way, a few hours.
Q.  Do you have room for the trophy?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I'll definitely make room for that.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think we'll celebrate Monday night, not Sunday night.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: He said he was going to meet me here.
Q.  Thank you, and congratulations.
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Thanks.
