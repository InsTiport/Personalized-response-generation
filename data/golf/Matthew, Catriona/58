Q.   What an unbelievable finish to your match.   How do you guys feel right now? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Absolutely fantastic.   Obviously disappointed to lose yesterday, so to get that half point, we really hung in there all day. 
And Caroline just hit a fantastic shot on the last and I hadn't holed a putt all day, so I thought I had to hole one. 
CAROLINE MASSON:   Yeah, we just saved the putt for the last.   We really couldn't make a putt today.   And played all right, I guess, but we were down all the time and it was just ‑‑ we were keeping calm and kept on fighting.   And I guess we probably deserved that one on the last. 

Q.   What do you think, are you going to do five?   Do you think they will send you out this afternoon? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I don't know, we'll wait and see.   It's pretty hot here. 
CAROLINE MASSON:   I don't know, we'll see.   I'm ready to play, but we'll see what the captains do.   It's up to them.
