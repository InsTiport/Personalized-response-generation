Q. So not exactly how you wanted to end it, but pretty steady all day.  How did you feel overall?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah.  Pretty pleased really with how I played.  6-under.  Obviously there were a lot of low scores out there today, but yeah, pleased I got myself in contention.
Q. Did you feel like you had to make a move on moving day with how the conditions were?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Definitely.  This is the least amount of wind we've had.  Every one else was shooting low scores, so I had to go out there and have a low one.
Q. What happened on the final hole?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I was kind of between clubs, and I went for a little 5.  I mean when I hit the second one, obviously I should have hit a 6.  That's just the way it goes.
Q. Were you kind of hoping it was out of bounds?  I mean your provision was great?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I was kind of hoping, but I got a freebie.
Q. Yeah, and you had a chance to make par, too.
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I had a chance to make par, yeah.
Q. You looked a bit disappointed when you saw that the ball --
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I knew when I saw it down there it wasn't exactly ideal, but did get a good drop.
Q. So this is a good turnaround for you, par, even par on the first round, and you've slowly made your way back in.  So what's been the difference since the first round, or can you pinpoint anything?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: First round, first nine holes were a bit scrappy, missed a lot of greens, made some good up-and-downs actually, but just played better the last couple of days, giving yourself more chances.
Q. And how is the course playing?  Not much wind today, very calm conditions, so low scores can be made.
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah.  Certainly very scorable today.  Obviously the last couple days -- well, the first day it was pretty windy, which makes it tougher, but today was pretty ideal.
