Q.
Talk about the match.  It was very competitive.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, I mean, the team played well.  They kept making birdies after us.  It was a good game.
Q.  What would you say was the turning point?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think it was 14.  It got them one up again.

That was the turning point.
Q.  Pretty tough for you on 18 when your partner put it in the water, and it was all up to you, but you still fought all the way and fought hard.  Great job.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, thanks.
Q.  Thank you.
