CATRIONA MATTHEW: I probably played my best today.  Crazy game.  Just that one bad shot on 9, just an impossible kind of lie.  And then a poor shot, I hit a perfect drive on 17 -- 6-iron, hit a bunker shot, missed the putt and 18, nice up and down.
Q. A final push tomorrow?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I'll be trying to make as many birdies as I can.
Q. You are going to take positives away?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, definitely.  I thought I played really well today.  Pleased with how I played.  Drove it really well.
Q. How far was the putt on the last?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Maybe about 12 feet.  Again, that was my best drive I've hit down that hole actually.
Q. Unlucky?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, sneaked into the bunker.  Just the drive is really difficult.  You know, you kind of have to fire it down the left, because I can't carry the bunkers on the right and hope the wind pushes it.  It's just a good drive.
Q. Hasn't been much wind over the first three days.  Would you like a little bit tomorrow or are you quite happy?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Quite happy with this.
Q. Still a tough enough test.
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Still a tough enough test.  You've still got to play well.
