 Q. Catriona, played tremendously well today. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, kind of shaky the first three or four holes and then we both started playing well. It was kind of a close game the whole way, I just probably holed a few more putts than Kristy.

 Q. In the last hour it looks like things have started to go against you guys. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I heard a few too many cheers. Hopefully we can get them going a little quieter, but there's still a chance if we can turn a couple around.
