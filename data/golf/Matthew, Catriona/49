 Q.  It's a good week for you this week.  You finished at 4-under par.  Are you pleased with that?  CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I played the back nine in 2-under, and the breeze was picking up a little bit, so it was a little bit trickier.  So, yeah, you're always a little bit disappointed, but it's a good start, something to build on.   Q.  When you came through and it was windy, but were you used to playing in those sort of conditions?  CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, it kind of came and went.  Never really too windy, but breezy.   Q.  You had five birdies out there.  What was the main strength today?  Was it good iron shots or what was playing well?  CATRIONA MATTHEW: Mostly good iron shots, and then I holed a ball on 15.  I rolled a huge putt on 15.   Q.  So your plans next week, what are you doing?  CATRIONA MATTHEW: Heading to San Diego tonight.  My family flew in yesterday, so going to have a week's holiday.   Q.  Lovely.  So last thing, you've won major championships.  You're used to being around the top of the leaderboard.  You have been up there much of the week.  Are you comfortable doing that?  CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, it's good being up there.  That's what you play for.  To be up there and get yourself in contention.  Yeah, that's what we all want to be every week.   Q.  So you're happy with your swing and looking forward to it?  CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, obviously, if you don't win, there are always some changes you can make.  So, yeah, pleased on it and will build on it for next time.   Q.  Next event is?  CATRIONA MATTHEW: Hawaii.
