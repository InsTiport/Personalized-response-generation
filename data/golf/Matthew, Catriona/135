CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Sure. 
 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Pretty unlucky.  I guess I was lucky on Thursday, missing the rain.  I don't know if I lost my concentration, but it was tricky in the rain.  I played so well on the front nine and then just let it go a little bit on the back nine. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Going away. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, I mean I'm not particularly happy, especially 3-putting the last.  But it's one of these things, I still got a one shot lead and I've got to look at that as a positive. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Maybe, I think, yeah.  On 16 I had about an 8-footer for par and by the time he had squeegeed it and the time I was ready to putt it was just wet again. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  A little.  We had to wait about five minutes and the group in front did before we could even play our shots to 16.  So when the green is that wet you got to maybe think about calling it off. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  The 11th.  I pushed my tee shot a little bit and just got caught behind some trees.  And then tried to play one over.  And it just bounced on the hard ground.  And kind of thinned it off through the back.  And chipped up and had a good effort at par and just missed.  And then a bad drive on 12 and just had to chip out. Again gave my chance for a par with a 10-footer, but I missed that.  Then I birdied 13, so I kind of got steadied again.  And then 15 I hit 7-wood on to the front of the green and there was a long putt up to the back.  And they had squeegeed and different things and, thinking it would be slow, I gave it a hit and just about went off the back of the green.  And so then a 3-putt.  And then 16 my drive found a bunker and I had to just chip out short.  And I hit a good shot in to probably six, seven feet. And I think that's where we stopped it.  Then I went back and missed the putt.  And then 18 3-putted. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  The first one was a long one.  I don't know, I've never been very good at that.  Maybe 30 feet.  And then missed probably about a 4-footer. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Just a little.  It was certainly wasn't the 7th. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think I've got to go in.  I'm playing well.  Like I say, I've got a one shot lead so I couldn't ask for a better place to be, really. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Obviously it's going to have to be, if I can shoot maybe something, I don't know, 67, around about there. Obviously, you never know what anyone else is going to do, but if I  just try and go as low as I can. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, obviously she's a big threat there.  She's had two good rounds the last two days.  Every one up there is capable of shooting a low score.  I think you got to look out for every one. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Birdied the second.  Hit it 5-iron on to about 12 feet.  3-putted.  Seven, I hit 4-iron on to maybe about eight feet and holed that.  Nine, I had drove the green and had about a 20-footer for eagle. 
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  11, yeah, I kind of pushed my tee shot a little right and then just kind of had to chip out and then chipped on and missed the putt. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I hit a 7-wood. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, I had maybe about a 12 foot putt. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thank you.
