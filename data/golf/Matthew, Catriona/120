DANA VON LOUDA:  Catriona, very good opening round.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thank you.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Five birdies, one bogey for 4 under, 68.  If you can give us some general comments, then we'll do your score card.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I mean, I felt today as though I played really pretty well.  Got off to maybe a slightly shaky start, missed a couple kind of five footers first two holes for birdie.  But really played pretty well.  Didn't really miss very many fairways.  I think just missed a couple greens.  Gave myself a lot of chances.
DANA VON LOUDA:  We'll go ahead and do birdies and bogeys.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I made a good save on the 5th, but drove in the rough, then just had to kind of hack out, then about 90 yards to the pin, hit it onto about 10 feet, holed that for par.

6, I birdied.  I hit 3 wood off the tee, then a little 8 iron to probably 15 feet, holed that for birdie.

Then 9, I went for the green, looked good again.  Just trickled into the back bunker.  Hit it out to probably six feet and holed that for birdie.

10, I hit 3 wood off the tee, 5 wood onto the green, about 10 feet for eagle, left it about two feet short, holed that for birdie.

Then 11, I just did a little chip onto the green from about 50 yards.  Thought I played it well.  It took a big bounce, went over the back.  I didn't get up and down.

Then 13, hit a little 6 iron onto probably eight feet, holed that for birdie.

17, actually hit my tee shot down the trees to the left, hit a 8 iron round to 10 feet, and holed that for birdie.
DANA VON LOUDA:  What club did you hit on 9?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Well, I just was in the back bunker.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Driver to the back bunker?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Driver.
Q.  You obviously like it here?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I don't know.  Obviously, yeah, I played well the last two times.  I think it's always nice coming back to a course you played well on.

I don't know, just the holes seem to set up well for me.  The par 5s are all reachable for me.  Greens are nice.
Q.  What time did you get up this morning?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  5:00, bright and early.
Q.  What is the key to playing well here at Sunningdale?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think you've got to take advantage of the par 5s.  I mean, they're all reachable.  I think like 9, you can drive it on.  You can get into trouble on them, but if you play them well, it kind of sets you up for a good score.
Q.  Having said that is it disappointing that you didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t birdie the first two holes?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, that wasn't    I missed probably two 5 footers.  Wasn't exactly a great start.

There's still a lot of birdie chances.  Obviously, 3 is a short par 4.  Coming around the turn, you've got a lot of good chances.
Q.  Is it getting windier out there?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, just kind of the last two or three holes.  Luckily for us it was downwind.  Made 16, 17, 18 play quite short.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Thank you.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thank you.
