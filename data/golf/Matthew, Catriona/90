 Q. Did you see that coming after the way you played yesterday?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah. I thought I played actually good today, just started concentrating, so good start yesterday. So then yeah, I played well. 

 Q. I know 10 years ago in this tournament you were right in the mix. Maybe there are some good feelings from that? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I honestly can't remember much about it, no. (Indiscernible). I still don't remember a whole lot from back then. That's just been coming back. 

 Q. It seems like, looking at the leaderboard, that there's a lot of birdies on the golf course. Do you expect that to continue through to the weekend?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah. I think as long as the weather stays nice, there's a lot of birdie chances on Sunday, but if the weather stays good, drive it on the fairway, you can give yourself a lot of good chances. 

 Q. What do you think that's telling about the course? Is it that easy or is there maybe some specific characteristics?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think the players are just pretty good. 
 If you get it in play, a lot of times short to grass, if you're on the fairway, then you have a chance a low scores. 

 Q. Do you have any expectations of what you need to do tomorrow? Is it more of the same?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think just more of the same. If I can keep giving myself some chances and try and putt really well the next two days, I'll have a good chance.
