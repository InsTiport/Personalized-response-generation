 Q. Well played last week, you finished Top-10, can you tell me about the start to your season?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, pleased with it. Had a really good first round, 5-under, and then the course was playing really pretty difficult last week. The greens were quite narrow and difficult to hit and were very fast. So was pleased with my finish.

 Q. So you didn't obviously get to play much over Christmas because of the snow, tell us about how you prepared for coming out for these hot clims. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I haven't really played much since, what was my last tournament, Lorena's in the end of November. I had five days in Spain and that was my practise. And been working out in the gym a lot, trying to get fitter and stronger and that's been my preparation rather than golfing. 

 Q. And how do you feel about this week, this course?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I mean, I think it course, a lot of it comes down to I think the second shots are tough here into the greens and I also find the greens here difficult with the grain.

 Q. Obviously you played here when you were five months' pregnant the year before that, although it's hot; easier than that?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, yeah, much easier. I think we had a heat wave that year, as well. It's definitely cooler here than last week, so yeah, shouldn't be too bad.
