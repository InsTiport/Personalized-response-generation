 FULL AUDIO INTERVIEW

  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your round today?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, played really well today. I think I just missed the one green. Missed the 16th green and got up- and-down out of the bunker. So I played really well. But I holed a few good kind of 8 to 10-footers which you have to do I think in the U.S. Open. But on the whole pleased with how I played.
 
  
Q. How ideal were scoring conditions this morning?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think that's probably the easiest we're going to get it from the looks of the scores I don't think it will be much more water put on the greens.
 
  
Q. They are kind of low aren't they, surprisingly low for a U.S.  
Open?
  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, for a U.S. Open. Yeah. But  
it really played -- it was out there for the taking this morning. 
 
  
Q. You only missed one green, did I hear you correct?
  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Two, actually. Sorry. I did say  
one, but two. Made a mistake. 
 
  
Q. Pretty good for --
  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah. Yeah. 
 
  
Q. For a U.S. Open?
  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah. 
 
  
Q. What number do you think is going to win this event to start  
the week?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I still think if you're around about even par you probably won't be far away. I think the course will just get more difficult as the week goes on. So just nice to get off to a good start.
 
  
Q. Is the rough much of a challenge?
  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: It's kind of patchy. You can be lucky or  
unlucky. 
 
  
Q. So you must have missed a couple fairways?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I missed a couple. Luckily on the right holes where you weren't to the elevated greens. So I could kind of bounce it into the greens.
 
  
Q. Could you go through your birdies and bogeys for us. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, sure. Started at 10. So birdied the 11th. I hit just a 52 degree wedge to about 15 feet and holed that one.
  
18, I hit driver, 3-wood just short of the green and chipped up to  
probably eight feet and holed that one. 
  
On the 3rd, I hit just a good wedge. Probably to about 20 feet  
short and holed that one for birdie. 
 
  
Q. You've been to this rodeo before. You're a  
veteran. Alfredsson is on the leaderboard, Davies is there,  
what's having played in this thing on as many times do for you, if  
anything?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think you just can't be too aggressive. I think even today you got to think that par is a good score on any hole. Just go out, especially on these greens and keep it below you're better having a 20-footer up the hill than a five feet down the hill, really.
 
  
Q. How do these greens compare to Pine Needles in terms of  
situations where you have to be defensive?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: They're certainly more undulation on these greens. Yes. I think you have to be -- obviously they were today they were playing a bit softer. But certainly if they get firmer, you definitely have to be more defensive.
