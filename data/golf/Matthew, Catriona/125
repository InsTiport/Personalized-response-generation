MARTIN PARK:   Okay.  Welcome.  Well played today.

JANICE MOODIE:  Absolutely.  We both gelled very very well. 


Q.  Give us your thoughts of your match and tell us was it pretty  --. 

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   It was kind of  -- it was always quite close on the front 9.  We had a couple of kind of good birdies on 8  -- 7 and 9, Janice made a couple of really good birdies.

JANICE MOODIE:   6, 7, and 9.

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   That kind of gave us an edge.  We were one or two holes up and then we never really lost the lead on that. 


Q.  What was it like watching that last match?

JANICE MOODIE:   Unbelievable.  I was in there having a beer.  I was a little bit shocked to see Laura Diaz putting again.  She putted on 17 and holed it, obviously very, very confident.  I was surprised.  I don't know if she was standing in Suzann's line or not.  I was watching television, I really don't know.  But it's kind of ballsy I guess is the word to say to go out and do that.  I guess Suzann holed a great putt.  It's tough watching it on television. 


Q.  And a difference between winning and losing that match?

JANICE MOODIE:   That's a huge difference.  You go either one point up or three points up.  It's a huge difference.  Three points will give us a big boost for going into tomorrow.  There's still a lot to do tomorrow.  Obviously we've all got to play well tomorrow.  A three point lead is a lot bigger than a one point lead.


Q.  The momentum in terms of how you end the day is sort of  --

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Yeah.  When Laura hit her shot on the 17, I watched that one on the TV and it looked like it was going in the hole.  Then Annika holed out just a great putt.  And then on 18 Laura hit another amazing shot.  It just kind of turned around.


Q.  You played all four sessions, how do you feel? 

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Ready for bed. 


Q.  Any concerns about tomorrow? 

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   No.  I think I'll be fine for tomorrow.  I'm not playing next week.  I have a week off.  So I'll sleep all week.


Q.  What did you feel when you were told in the television interview that you weren't playing?  Did you know you were playing? 

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Well, it kind of threw me because I had been told I was playing.  So I just kind of didn't quite know what to think.


Q.  You quickly found out that you were? 

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Yes. 


Q.  Do you think that Diaz hurried that last putt? 

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I don't know. 

JANICE MOODIE:   I don't really know.  It's tough knowing that.  But I think sometimes when you're in pressure situations, it's sometimes better to actually hurry up and believe it or not and give yourself less time to think.  So maybe that was what she was trying to do.  I don't really know.  Sometimes it's just, okay, boom, that's the line, hit it.  I really don't know. 


Q.  Is there a key to why you two play so well together?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   We probably both have quite similar games.  We don't get in a whole lot of trouble which is good for foursomes.  We've obviously played a lot of golf together, comfortable playing with each other, which I think makes a big difference.  You know the other person is not bothered if you hit a bad shot or whatever.  It just kind of works well together.

JANICE MOODIE:   The other thing is we're both trying out there.  I think we know that each other is trying and that helps you.


Q.  Any guess on how many times you've played together?

JANICE MOODIE:   Quite a few.

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Quite a lot. 

JANICE MOODIE:   All the Curtis cups, Scottish teams.

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   We played together for a few years in foursomes.
