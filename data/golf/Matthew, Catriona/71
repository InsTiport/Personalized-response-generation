 Q. Catriona, talk about playing today. It must be sort of satisfying to get that point? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, fantastic. When I saw the draw and knew who I was up against, it was Paula I knew I'd have a tough game. 
 But just the whole day trying to take my chances and not let her get a sniff of a comeback or else she's very tough. I knew she'd be out there trying her hardest.

 Q. Even by your standards, that was pretty special. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I played really well, yeah, most of the day. I was well in front after 7 holes, and since the rain really came on. It was pretty foul. Yeah, after the three-putt on the first and the two-putt, apart from that, I played pretty well.

 Q. Five singles wins in a row. What was the secret? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I don't know. I just go out there and try to play my own game. I was just trying to make pars. It's difficult out here no matter what the weather conditions are. If I try to make pars, and I make a birdie, that's good.

 Q. You're going out to support your teammates. How do you decide where to go? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I'll go down to see if Anna can get another point on the board.
