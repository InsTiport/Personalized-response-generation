CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Things are certainly going well.  Yes. Do you want me to go through my round?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I birdied the first hole.  Kind of scuffed a 4-wood down.  And then it was probably about 20 yards short of the green.  And hit a good kind of sand iron over the bunker to about five feet and holed for birdie. Then on No. 2 I kind of hit that 4-wood again.  Kind of popped it down the right.  A good shot out of the rough to about eight feet.  And holed for birdie.  And then just kind of regulation pars up to eight.  And then nine I hit 3-wood off the tee, so I could probably get there, but it was just a little softer than it had been.  And chipped down to about six feet and holed for birdie.  And then 10 I hit 3-wood and then hit 4-iron into the bunker.  And then played a good bunker shot out to maybe about eight feet and holed for birdie.  12, didn't hit a very good drive.  Left myself a 5-iron into the green and just kind of hit a terrible shot out to the right.  And I just kind of chipped up to the back of the green and 3-putted for a bogey.  And then 14 I hit a 3-wood probably about 20 yards short of the green and chipped up to, I think probably six feet.  And I holed that for birdie.  And then 15 I was just going to hit a little 7-wood and I just got a good bounce and it popped in the hole.

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, 216.  I think.  And then 18 I hit 7-iron, kind of went a little right of where I was aiming and just sneaked over the bunker.  And just went to probably about three feet and I holed that for birdie.


Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  That's my second one.  Yeah.  Ever.  I had one at the J. C. Penney.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  No.  It happened on the back.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I don't know if it's ever effortless. I played well.  I really didn't miss the fairways.  I think that's probably the key around here.  And I birdied the par-5's, which again, I mean, I know they're all reachable, but you still got to hit two good shots and make birdie on them, I think.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  No, I was kind of telling it to get down.  I think it took a big first bounce just short of the green and when I saw it there on television it was kind of going quite hard.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  High five.  Yeah.  They were delighted.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah, there was.  We had quite a good group following us all day.  Yeah.  They were shouting and clapping.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  At the time actually, yeah, I did  realize I had taken the lead, but I wasn't really thinking that.  I was actually pleased that I got a hole-in-one.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I don't know.  We will find out tomorrow.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  His parents are here and my uncle and aunt.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think just go out and I think you just got to try and birdie the par-5's.  I think you still got to play pretty aggressively.  Because there is potentially a lot of low scores out there.  Because you can kind of have eagles or things on the par-5's.  So you're still going to have to go out there and make a lot of birdies.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think we have both probably improved.  I'm probably a better player, I think just experience. You learn how to cope in these situation the more times you're there.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  It was a joint decision.  We were kind of toying between that and a 4-iron.  And Grace didn't quite get 4-iron there so I reckoned I couldn't get it there, if she couldn't.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Not that I remember, no.  It was the second to last of the Open.  It might have been close, I can't remember.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I don't know if there's a secret.  I suppose it's always easy when you're playing well.  If you're not playing as well, it's difficult.  But just still, if he's not caddying, we wouldn't really see each other.  So for us it works out well.  I think you got to try and if it works, it works.  If it doesn't, it doesn't.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah.  I mean, we discuss all our clubs and things, so it really is quite a joint effort, really.  He's good at clubbing me.  Obviously, he's watched me play enough, so he's good.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  He might be able to manage that.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I never played here as an amateur so the first time I played it was the Open four years ago.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think I am probably driving the ball better and my short game is improving.  Still got a long way to go with the short game.  But it's getting better.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah.  I had a brief spell, I think I won when I was putting left hand low.  I think one tournament I went out and missed three, 5-footers in the first three holes so I changed back to normal and stuck with it.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Probably about eight or nine.  Eight weeks. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Well, we're over there for 10 months of the year, so.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  No, I like coming home when I've got some time off.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  No.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Who knows.  Probably not.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:


Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Pine Needles.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think for me I just got to try and keep it slow.  I think that my tendency is to get nervous and my swing gets a little quick.  So I just try and keep it smooth.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thanks.
