   THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Catriona Matthew, 1 out of the lead heading into the weekend. Can you take me through your day and what was working for you? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, we managed a couple more greens today but I knocked 'em down and felt great out there. Will continue to do the same and try to stay on top.
 THE MODERATOR: Two straight rounds without a bogey. Does this course suit your game? Is there something about it that you like?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I've always liked it. This is my third year I've been here now. I've always liked the course, you've got to make your way round it a little bit more, putt your way around it, not just drive everywhere, so I've always liked the course and it suits my play, yeah. 

 Q. Since your last title at the British, how much do you want to win this? I know it's just Friday and we have a couple more days ahead, but how much did you want to win?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I would really like to win it. I had a chance last week so all you can do is keep putting yourself into the right position and hopefully I can come through with another win, and I'm definitely gong to try my hardest. 

 Q. (Away from mic.)
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Just the fact that I have probably driven well, hit for fairways, making my second shot easier. I've hit most of the fairways this year, and hitting that second shot helps you with getting up and down and is important to keep you in contention.

 Q. The greens, they're said to be firm. Can you talk a bit about the course?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I'd say the greens are a mixture, sometimes the ball stops and it's firm, but, yeah, in the two rounds I've been giving myself some chances. So hopefully I can roll in a few more. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very 
much.
