   CATRIONA MATTHEW: Two rounds to go, five shots is nothing around this course. Obviously I would have liked to have had another couple of birdies, but 5-under is not too bad.

 Q. Good one at the last. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, another good save there. Managed to hit that fairway sometime.

 Q. What kind of lie did you have there? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: For the second shot it was just a chip-out. It was pretty deep. 

 Q. All the other players, Yani and Se Ri, they've all been talking about they want the wind to get up, nothing they'd like more than some heavy showers. Do you take that view?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Not really. I'd quite like just nice weather. I've played enough golf in that in Scotland. 

 Q. Why do you think that's the case? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Well, I think they think it's like that all the time here, so they want to do that. But I'm quite happy with sunshine. 

 Q. How far off the lead were you in 2009? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think I took like a three-shot lead going into the last day.

 Q. And at the halfway mark? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Was I leading? I can't remember. I was either leading or close to the lead, yeah. 

 Q. Do you feel the atmosphere is building up around the course?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, definitely. There are a lot more people here today, obviously a nicer day and things. I think it is a good forecast for the week. Yeah, I think they'll get some good crowds out. 

 Q. Today was a quite a nice start in terms of --
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I really got two ideal times, two morning times, 6:50 and 11:30, so yeah, they were perfect.

 Q. We've seen players like Garcia and Van de Velde blow up on this 18th. Is it as daunting as perhaps we've been led to believe?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Obviously it's forward and we've not had the wind that they had when they played, but yeah, certainly still if you miss the fairway, I think you've just got to maybe take your meds and chip out and chip on.

 Q. Do you think that will be a deciding hole come the final day?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I think the last three holes. 16 is a tough par, and then 17 you've got the chance of eagle or birdie, so I think the last three holes a lot could happen.

 Q. Everyone is going to be right in the mix right down the final stretch. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, with 14 and 17 with realistic eagle chances, anything could happen. You could pick up quite a few shots. They always help.
