  CATRIONA MATTHEW: Bogey on 17 a bit disappointing, but overall, fairly pleased. 

Q. 65 to lead the course today, did it feel like that out there, that that score could have been bettered? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I don't know if it could have been bettered. That's a pretty good score, that, 65 around here. I'm fairly happy with mine so just go from there. 

Q. Could you talk me through a couple of your key holes. 
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Obviously 3, eagled. Hit drive, rescue to about 25 feet and holed for eagle. 
And then I suppose 8 and 17 where I missed probably two kind of 4‑, 5‑footers for par and a birdie. But apart from that, played well.

Q. Conditions out there for you, did you feel it was a scoring day? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, obviously I think‑‑ I haven't seen the scores but there's obviously some good ones out there. There's still a breeze. It's still difficult. Still had to play well. But from the forecast, this might be the easiest day we get. 

Q. You've obviously started well‑ish, so how are you going to go forward? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Just keep trying to play how I'm playing. Thought I drove the ball pretty well, apart from a couple of drives. Hit the ball well. Just more of the same I think.

Q. Did you feel the Scottish support at all? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, there was definitely a few Scots out there watching. The sunshine helped.
