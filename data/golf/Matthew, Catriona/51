Q. It was very windy when you were out, and possibly to your advantage because you're quite used to playing in the wind?CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, it was pretty awful the first six holes.  It was kind of like a sandstorm, so not great for anyone.Q. But you kept it together?CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, kept it together.  Made a couple of good putts, made three good birdies at the turn.Q. What would you say was it your putting today?CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, obviously annoyed with my finish, three-putting the last.  But overall going out with that wind, I would have taken 1-under.  In about half an hour it will be fine.Q. On the last, were you against the wind coming up to the 18?CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I put a tee shot in the rough and had a bad lie.  Had the a 5-iron into the green.Q. Despite the annoying finish, you've got to be quite pleased with it.  It's a good start and not that many people under par today.  So you've handled the conditions?CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, overall pleased with today.Q. Possibly a slightly harder half this morning?CATRIONA MATTHEW: Who knows.  Who knows what might do tomorrow.  You just never know, do you?  Wait and see.  You just have to play with what you've got.
