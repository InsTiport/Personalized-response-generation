Q. Just an assessment of the performance overall?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Apart from yesterday, really played pretty well. Just disappointed with yesterday and then not really having a chance of anything today. At least shot under par today.

Q. And conditions were really tough yesterday?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Obviously they were tough yesterday. I think the wind direction yesterday was tougher and it was windier. So yeah, it was just a tough day.

Q. What went well for you in the final round? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I just played well today. I think I hit 16 greens and holed the odd putt. It was just quite a steady 1â€‘under, really. 

Q. And how do you assess the whole experience of being here in Rio?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I really enjoyed it. I'm glad that I came down a few days early and got to see some other things. Really enjoyed it. 

Q. What are your plans from here? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Fly out tonight to Heathrow and then on to Calgary.
