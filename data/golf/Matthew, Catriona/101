 Q.  Catriona, sent out first to get some blow on the board.  How does it feel to do just that? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  It feels great.  Definitely played my best golf today.  I think the rest yesterday helped me. 

 Q.  Turning point must have been the putt at 12. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I was just trying to 2-putt.  Two great shots onto the green.  Laura had a tough putt for par.  I was trying to tap it down there. 

 Q.  Is it tough with so much red on the board? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Few of the games are pretty close.  Hopefully we can turn them around.  Yeah, it would be nice if we can put more blue. 

 Q.  Well done. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thank you very much. 

 Q.  Were you surprised, or were you asked about being on top? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Helen asked me.  I said I would be very happy.  I was pleased today.  Nice to get a point.  Maybe we can turn a few more around.  My short game was pretty good this week.  I hit some good chips. 

 Q.  Did you give a pep talk, any words of encouragement? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  It was kind of difficult with most of the night playing.  Yeah, I mean, it was just kind of difficult with the way it had gone yesterday and this morning. 

 Q.  Did you get together before the singles?  I know there wasn't a great deal of time. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  No.  They were still finishing, and I was warming up. 

 Q.  What did Helen say to you on the first tee? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Just "Good luck and go out and try to win a point."  She had confidence in me. 

 Q.  You had a big putt at the beginning. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I just gone 1-up on 6 and hit the tee shot in the bunker on 7.  Then missed a 15 one.  That was a good par.  Lost 9 and 10.  9 my tee shot was too far.  She made a good up and down out of the bunker for par.  Then 10, just a little long on the tee shot, ran off.  It was a real up-slope, slide-slope, and she hit it, basically birdied it.  She hit to like 3 feet. 
 Then 11 was maybe the turning point, 11 and 12.  We both hit it in the greenside bunker.  She kind of hit a long bunker shot and thinned it over. 
 2-putt probably would have won it.  Probably the turning point in those two holes.
