CATRIONA MATTHEW: Not the greatest start.  Then holed kind of a good 30-footer on 11 for birdie and that got me going.  Hit it close on the next hole for birdie and then a good up-and-down on 13.  Then good birdies on 14 and 15 from quite close.  Pleased with that.   
 Q.  How did you get yourself going after the first nine?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think the putt on 11 kind of got me going.  It wasn't, my wedge kind of spun back a little bit and it wasn't looking great for birdie and then holed a good 30-footer back up the hill which just kind of kick started me.   
 Q.  And you would have played this course before, so how are you finding it?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: It's a good golf course.  The fairways are quite soft, so it's playing fairly long, but if you can drive it well, you've got some good chances but the greens are tricky.  You've got to make sure you put it in the right spots on the greens.  Try and keep it below the holes.   
 Q.  So as you're getting to know it, you're finding it's suiting you?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I think it's a course you've got to drive it well, which usually I drive the ball pretty well.  So yeah, I think that suits me, and I hit my irons hopefully on the whole pretty good.  So if I can get it in the right spots, all sounds too easy.   
 Q.  What time were you up this morning?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I was up at 5.00.  5.05 actually, leave it till the last second.   
 Q.  One snooze button?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: No, I never snooze.  Might never get up.   
 Q.  You were practicing at 6?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I came up here and had some practice and went down on to the range about six.  Once you're up, it's nice to be out early.  It was perfect.  There was not a breath of wind.  It was lovely.
