 Q. You were the right person to have a 1-meter putt in this situation. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  It was a long 1 meter, but I'm glad it went in the hole. 

 Q.  Were you nervous? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think my legs were just about shaking. 

 Q.  What are your thoughts about when you had six holes to go, 5-up, and then they tied -- five in a row, four in a row. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  We kind of made pars.  They kept throwing birdies after us.  These conditions, there's not much you can do against birdies.  They played really good golf. 

 Q.  What did you say to each other in that situation? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  We just tried to hit the fairways and hit the greens and gave ourselves a few birdie chances.  We couldn't get it in and they were holing them. 

 Q.  How important was this point? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  It's really important.  We were kind of looking to win all today.  If it would have been a halve, it would have been disappointing. 

 Q.  What do you say about the games in the afternoon?  The others you're hoping for them? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Hoping for them yet.  I think the rest will do me good.  Four rounds in these conditions, it would have been tough to play tomorrow. 

 Q.  Singles tomorrow? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Singles tomorrow. 

 Q.  Do you want the wind or a little bit calmer tomorrow? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think a little bit calmer. 

 Q.  Try to oblige you. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thank you.
