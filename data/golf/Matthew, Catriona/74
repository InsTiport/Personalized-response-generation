 Q. How impressed were you with Azahara's play? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, fantastic. You would have never known it was her first Solheim Cup. I missed a couple greens and she chipped them in, and kind of kept it pretty steady on the greens and that's what we had to do today.

 Q. Obviously, helpful to have an experienced partner alongside you. What sort of things did she say to you as you were teeing off in the first place? 
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: Our first hole was a little shaky. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Obviously not the right things. 
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: No, she just told me just keep it quiet. It's just one hole and keep it going.

 Q. What are your thoughts on this afternoon? Do you know if you're playing? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I don't know yet.

 Q. A little change in format from foursomes where you try to make a lot of pars, to then playing four balls and trying to make a lot of birdies?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, this afternoon we'll be a lot more aggressive, and this morning we were just trying to hit the greens and make pars, but we'll need to make birdies this afternoon.

 Q. How did you feel this morning when you teed off? 
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: You know what, I thought I was going to be more nervous. I didn't play good my first hole, but I wasn't that nervous. 
 I actually quite liked the environment, like people cheering your name and saying Europe, so I was enjoying it.

 Q. Have you ever played in any atmosphere like this before? 
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: Not quite like this, not even close.

 Q. And do you know if you're playing this afternoon? 
 AZAHARA MUNOZ: No, we don't know yet. It depends on how the morning goes.
