Q.   6‑under for the day.   Right now sitting at the low round of the day.   Can you tell me what was working for you out there?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Yeah, I mean, I played probably just as well as I did yesterday, but just holed a few more putts today.   That was the difference really.

Q.   After you made the turn, what was it, four out of first six holes birdies?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Yeah, I just saw there were quite a few 3s.

Q.   Yes, there were quite a few 3s.   In particular on those holes it just came down to putting today? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Yeah, think I was just so annoyed with myself on 10 for that shocking chip.   Kind of holed a good putt on 11 for birdie and then hit it in quite close on the other ones for birdies.

Q.   This is your seventh time playing here.   What do you like about this course?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I think it's always in such good shape.   Greens are always perfect; fairways are good. 
The heat doesn't really both me too much.   I just like the course.   Fits my eye.

Q.   This is your second event this season.   Anything in particular you were working on in the off‑season, or business as usual?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Yeah, I went away to Abu Dhabi in with my coach for six days in January to practice.   There are always one or two things you're working on.   I think you've always got to be working on something.

Q.   Your coach is?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Kevin Craggs.
