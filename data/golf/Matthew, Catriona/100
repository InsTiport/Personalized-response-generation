   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Catriona, thanks for coming in and joining us. Great round out there, 6-under par 66 on the final round, and your best finish this year since the 2007 Kraft Nabisco Championship. Can you just talk about everything coming together this week and playing through the conditions that we've dealt with? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I felt I've been playing really well at the start of this year, just hadn't been scoring very well. I hadn't been putting very well, and just started -- made a couple of putts for par and a couple of big birdie putts, which just kind of gets you right going.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Let's go over your scorecard, starting with your only bogey of the day on the 3rd hole. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I kind of pushed a 5-iron into the right bunker and didn't really have much of a shot and gave myself maybe an eight-footer for par, which just lipped out. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 6. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Hit a really good 5-iron to a couple of foot, knocked that one in.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 8. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I actually pushed my tee shot, plugged in the bunker and hit a great bunker shot and it just trickled into the hole. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 11. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I was just kind of -- decided to lay up. It was kind of touch-and-go so laid up and hit a little wedge in to probably six feet and holed that one.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 13. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: 13, I hit 9-iron into probably 15 feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 15. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: 15, I hit a really good 5-iron to six feet on the par-3.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And birdie on 18 to push you into second. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I just laid up to a good number, hit my 58-degree, just spun back a little too much, but probably holed a 10-footer. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Did you feel any pressure going onto the 18th hole? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Well, I looked at the scoreboard there when I was on the 18th green and knew that putt might be worth a few pounds.

 Q. You're finished for the day, you finished your 18th hole. The leader is on 18 leading by one. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Anything can happen. We'll just see what she does. 

 Q. This might be a stupid question. Are you nervous? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I mean, I don't really expect Lorena to bogey, but you never know. I'll be ready if she does. 

 Q. Are you happy to have a chance to finish second?
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I played really well all week. Just started holing a few putts. That's been the difference from the start of the year. I've been striking the ball really well, just putting good.

 Q. It's not easy trying to catch Lorena. 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: No, never easy, not the way she's been playing the last couple of years, but I gave it a good try. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Thanks, Catriona, and we'll see you down the road.
