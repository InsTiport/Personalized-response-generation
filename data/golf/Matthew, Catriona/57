Q.   Try and explain what is going through your mind standing here. 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Well I was kind of shaking.   They told me coming up, so I knew that if we get a half there, we would win it outright.   But I'm still shaking, I think.

Q.   Where does this rank in your list of achievements?   You've won Major Championships. 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Any time you can celebrate with your 11 teammates and all the other helpers, caddies and everything, it makes it far more exciting and more fun.

Q.   You were a couple down with a handful of holes to go, how deep did you have to dig?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I played well.   She made some good birdies on 13 and 14, and then I made two poor putts for me, on 15 and 16.   And I made a good par on 17 and a great long ‑‑ I like these little five footers on the last.

Q.   History is made, obviously it's the first time it's been won in the UnitedStates, you played here three times and lost.   What was the difference this week? 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I think the rookies.   The rookies played really well.   That 4‑0 yesterday really set us up.   We really couldn't lose today, if we would have lost today that would have just been a disaster.   So 4‑0 yesterday really set it up.

Q.   Talk about the contribution of your captain for us. 
CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Lotta has been great all week.   She just kind of inspires us, and gives us such confidence. 
I think that was all ‑‑ we don't need much motivation to go out and play in these, but she's obviously got the pairings right.
