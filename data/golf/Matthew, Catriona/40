CATRIONA MATTHEW: If we maybe holed just a few more putts.  Karine got us up.  To go in last night 1-up, I think was a big boost to us.  And they kind of gifted 16 to us.  And then a birdie on 17,   
 Q.  You were 3-up after three holes.  They never gave up, did they?  You needed birdies at this moment?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: We birdied the first seven holes, one of us, birdieing every hole.  So we had to hole some putts.   
 Q.  What do you make of the rest of the day now?  
KARINE ICHER: We hope Suzann and Charley can do well for us.  Go into the lead with as big lead as possible.   
 Q.  Congratulations in what was a very important point for your team.  How are you feeling after that?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Delighted.  Couldn't be happier.  We knew we had to come out and make birdies and we did that.   
 Q.  Karine, you putted extremely well yesterday and carried that to today.  How big is this partnership?  The two of you just played so well together?  
KARINE ICHER: We had to play well, because they're really hard to beat.  We played great at the same time.  So it was like we have many opportunities but at the same time.  We missed some in middle of the course, but then with the birdie on 15, and a little gift on 16 by the American team, it was not easy to win here, but a little bit easier.   
 Q.  That birdie on 15 last night, that was pretty special?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Delighted with that one.  It gave us some momentum.  We were both a bit disappointed.  We both missed a few putts on the last holes.  To get that one and get 1-up gave us a big boost going into last night.
