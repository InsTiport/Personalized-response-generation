 Q. You guys put up a good fight today. What exactly in the match didn't go your way? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I mean, we kind of messed up the second. We should have won that. They put it in the water and we kind of diddled about at the green and we should have won that one. 
 They made a few good up-and-downs. Juli hit a couple of bad shots and then holed a couple good putts. That kind of kept them in it, and we just kind of hung in there. They probably made a good birdie on 15. We were just coming back. We got them back to 1, and then they made a good birdie at 15 to go back to 2. I thought we had a chance there, but can't do much about that.

 Q. How will this loss affect your play tomorrow and your team's? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think they probably finished this session 2-all, so we're one-and-a-half behind, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.
