Q.  I'm with the comeback duo, both matches.  This morning you both turned it around on the Back 9, it happened again today.

What was the magic you had going out there?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I think on the Back 9 we were hanging in, on the Front 9 and the Back 9 Annika turned it on.  I was walking along enjoying the game.
Q.  So much great play, and certainly to get the match in.  Annika, what happened with that controversy over the spike marks?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   It was a spike mark that was right in my line, and I was wondering if there was something we can do about it.

Obviously, I know the rules, but I was thinking they could tweak it this time.  I'm not going to worry to much about that.  Catriona let me play some golf on the back and I think we're happy with the match.
Q.  You struggled with your golf swing in both matches.  Was there something that turned you around specifically?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Catriona gave me a little tip she told me on the 8th hole.  After that I played really solid.  It was a little tip that helped me and it clicked it off.
Q.  That's why we have partners.

Catriona, I notice that Catrin showed up and wanted to encourage you on number 8.  What did she have to say to you?  What was your tip?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I didn't give her a tip.  Just to hang in there.  You never know what's going to happen.  I was trying to hit fairways and greens and keep myself in the holes to make it easier for Annika.
Q.  Great play today for both of you.  Congratulations.
