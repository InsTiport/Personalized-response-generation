CATRIONA MATTHEW: It was probably a little harder out there today.  Windier today I think.  As I say, played well again today.  Just no birdies, which makes it tough.  I had a lot of chances, actually.  Just couldn't quite get it in the hole.
Q. Putting difficult today in that wind?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Putting is tough in the wind, yeah.  But hopefully I'll hole some at the weekend.
Q. How do these conditions compare?  Are they almost as bad as you've had here?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I think this is worse than we've ever had here actually.  Certainly the windiest we've had.
Q. Lydia Ko said it's the hardest she's ever played in anywhere.
CATRIONA MATTHEW: It was definitely windy.  Some spots today were pretty -- it was just pretty windy.
Q. When you were younger, playing in Scotland all the time, you were used to this, but your game is more acclimatised to American golf now.  Is it difficult to adjust again?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Not really.  I've been hitting my punch shots really well.  Hopefully that may continue the next week and a half.  But yeah, I suppose it takes you a little bit to get used to it.  But you do; you never forget.
