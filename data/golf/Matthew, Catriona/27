 Q.  Thoughts on that?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Birdied the last, so a good 2-putt from 30 yards.  I actually I hit two bad shots, and made bogey from each of them.  Then actually hit a good drive down 2 and just stayed straight dead in the wind and went in the bunker, so bogey.   
Played the rest of the holes nicely but just didn't really hole any putts.   
 Q.  And the conditions?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: It's pretty windy.  It was windy.  Obviously not great but felt as though I played well.  I just need to hole a few more putts.  This kind of weather, you're going to make the odd mistake, so you need to make a few birdies.   
 Q.  Nice to finish with a birdie?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: It's always nice to finish.   
 Q.  6-under around there for Karrie and Cristie, pretty impressive?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Very impressive.  It was windy all day, so yeah, two very good scores.   
 Q.  Is that a day that shows that experience could count out there?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: I suppose maybe if you're used to playing in it a little bit.  It was probably at least three clubs in some spots.  So you had to try to keep it under the wind.  In that kind of weather, you know, it's tough to get the ball close.   
 Q.  Go out tomorrow and try and get in the mix?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, absolutely.
