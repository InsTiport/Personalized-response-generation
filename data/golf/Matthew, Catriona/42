Q. Lovely putt at the end.
SANDRA GAL: Thank you very much.  It was quite a morning out there.  We fed off the crowds really, really nicely.  They were so into it and so supportive.
Q. Nice start?
SANDRA GAL: It was a pleasure playing with her.  She's so experienced and so laid back.  We just really felt like one person playing out there, which is what it's all about in foursomes.
Q. Was it exciting playing in front of the home crowds?  Obviously they were biased, but was it more than you expected?
SANDRA GAL: It was more than I expected.  It was just electrifying.  It's just so cool to have their joy and their enthusiasm catch on us.  I think we played better because of them.
Q. You might get to feel that this afternoon, what's your feeling?
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I'm playing with Caroline Masson in the last group out, and we've been talking about that for a while.  So we're I think going to have a really good time out there.
