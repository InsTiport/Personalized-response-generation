  Q.  Catriona Matthew.  Sum up your day starting with the foursome.   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  In the foursomes we were up against Laura and Sherri, made six birdies.  It was tough right there.  They had six birdies.  Not much you can do.   
 This afternoon played really well.  Kind of played a little better on the front-9 and even made some great birdies at 13 and 14.   
  
  Q.  What was it like going out in the four-ball after losing the first match?   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Just made you even more determined to win this one.  Didn't want to go 2-0.   
  
  Q.  What does it say about the match overall so far?   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Yeah.  A few tight games.  Hopefully turnaround a couple games this afternoon.  That would be good.   
  
  Q.  What would you like the score to be going into Sunday for single matches?   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Obviously we're leading, that would be great.   
  
  Q.  Were you surprised that Suzann Pettersen didn't play this afternoon?   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I don't know.  I didn't see the match this morning.  I don't know if pressure or whatever.  Getting a little rest and be ready for the next two days.   
  
  Q.  Thank you.   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thanks very much.
