  Q. How did your round go today?  
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I really actually played not too badly. Just didn't putt very well. I find these greens quite tricky. They are very grainy, so hope to master them tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You got off to a good start, though.   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Played pretty well today. I gave myself some chances, just one silly, bad hole, 10, for a double.   
 Just pulled my second shot into the bunker, and then kind of made a mess of it from there. But apart from that played well.  
  
  Q. So you're still quite close to coming together.   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah.  
  
  Q. And how did the course play, seems like it was scoring well.   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I think it's a quite tricky course. I find the greens quite difficult here. It's quite tricky actually.  
  
  Q. It's easier playing when you're not pregnant.   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, I don't know how I did it last year.
