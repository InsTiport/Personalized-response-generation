 Q.  Congratulations, an important point on the board, puts you two, 1-up?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Great anytime you can get a point.  It was a close match the whole way.  We just happened to hole the putts at the right time.   
 Q.  How was the course playing after all the rain yesterday?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Remarkably good, actually.  The greens are fantastic.  A couple of the fairways are a bit soggy.  But considering the amount of rain, it's in great shape.   
 Q.  You were playing along the German, Sandra Gal.  How was the atmosphere out there, it felt pretty special?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, it was really good.  That walk through the tunnel on to the first tee with Sandra, it was pretty amazing.   
 Q.  The putts you holed on 10 and then 11, how did that feel?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: Yeah, they were good.  They were real momentum changers, you just want to try to get out there.   
 Q.  Did you hear your mom screaming?  
CATRIONA MATTHEW: No, there were quite a few people there.
