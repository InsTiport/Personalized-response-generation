Q.
Does this win help stop the US momentum?
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  It was a very nice win for our team, something that we needed.  The individual play really doesn't matter, it's all about the team.
Q.  Talk about your play.
CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I played pretty well today, made a lot of birdies.  They came out strong.  We still could get half.  A miracle could still happen.
