  JEFF HART:   I thought it was quite a bit easier.   No wind, basically.   Two, three miles an hour.   Wasn't like it was blowing hard in the practice rounds, but it was blowing considerably harder than this.   I thought it played easier, quite a bit easier, yeah.   
   
 Q.   When the wind picked up, what happened out there?   
JEFF HART:   Well, yeah, it will get‑‑  
   
 Q.   Got over to the wrong side [inaudible].   
JEFF HART:   It got tougher.   It doesn't look like it's going to today.   Tomorrow when we play in the afternoon, might be a concern.   It's not playing that hard.   I mean, the fairways are relatively soft.   Greens are even somewhat soft and the greens aren't very fast.   You know, they're not what you would expect, I think, out of a U.S. Open.   Typically, they're a little bit faster than this.   They're flash downhill, and we've got a lot of downhill putts.   I expect it to get tougher as the week goes on for sure.   
   
 Q.   Did you have maybe more under par out there that you didn't take advantage of?   
JEFF HART:   Oh, you can always say that, yeah.   I've missed some short putts, and I birdied the first two holes.   So I basically played 1 over the last 16.   So, yeah, you can always think of shots you could have saved in that span.  
But I did make some putts too.   I made a 20, 25‑footer for par on 13.   You know, those you don't expect to make either.   So when you forget about the ones you saved, then you only remember the little ones you miss.   But, yeah, overall I thought the course played a little bit easier than the practice rounds.  
   
 Q.   Did you see Kite at, was that minus 7?   
JEFF HART:   I knew that was going on.   I heard someone say that.   What did he end up?  
   
 Q.   Doubled 17.   
JEFF HART:   That's a great score today for sure.   Thanks a lot.   You bet.
