Q. Jesper, a bit of frustration today; how was it for you?
JESPER PARNEVIK: There wasn't much going on.  I think I only made one birdie.  I didn't hit it real close until the back nine a little bit, and I couldn't hold anything anyway.
1-over is not bad.  Of course I wanted to shoot a few under.  If I could have just shot two, three better, it would increase my chances for tomorrow, but I still stood a chance.  Miguel showed us that 7-under is around here.
Q. What are the positives you can bring out of today's round?
JESPER PARNEVIK: The positives; that I waited until the last hole to miss a short putt, because I felt like I was going to miss one all day.  I waited until 18, which that was the positive.
The other positive is I can go and practice some putting now.
Q. Weather conditions today might be quite wet.  Do you think that will benefit you?
JESPER PARNEVIK: The tougher it's going to be, the better it is for everybody that's behind, first of all.  The course is tough anyway.  I mean, we had maybe one- or two-club wind today.  But with some rain and some nasty winds tomorrow, who knows what's going to win, and that's good for everyone that's chasing.
Q. You said chasing.  This tournament is never over on this course, is it?
JESPER PARNEVIK: No, you saw what Jean Van de Velde did not too long ago on 18 here.  16,  17, 18 is very brutal holes.  Anything can happen.  If anyone can post a pretty good score early, you never know.
Q. How will you prepare for tomorrow's round?
JESPER PARNEVIK: How am I going to prepare?  I don't know.  I don't feel prepared so far this week, so I don't know.  Probably try to do something different.
