Q.
Talk about the round today.
JESPER PARNEVIK:  I got off to a good start, birdie on 1, and then absolutely nothing happened.  I didn't make a putt until I think it was the 13th or 14th hole, made three birdies coming in, and that was it.

The way Vijay is playing right now, it seems like we have to go pretty low to catch him.
Q.  How remarkable is this, the run he's on?
JESPER PARNEVIK:  I mean, it's amazing.  It's just as amazing as Tiger was four years ago.

It also shows you how small a margin there is in golf.  You can get on a run, you can win every week, or you can miss every cut.  That's how small the difference is really.
Q.  When you looked up at the leaderboard and saw Vijay had birdied 1, did you think, "Oh, boy, this is going to be tough"?
JESPER PARNEVIK:  No, I expected him to birdie 1, but I saw him at 17 under at 12 or 13, and I thought, "It's going to be tough for someone to do anything about that now."
Q.  (Inaudible).
JESPER PARNEVIK:  Yeah, I mean, I've played very consistent.  12- or 13-under is usually good enough to win around here, so what can I do?
Q.  Best finish of the year?
JESPER PARNEVIK:  Oh, yeah, and I'm ready for a long break now.
Q.  What do you think about Kirk having some fun out there with you?
JESPER PARNEVIK:  It's Halloween.  He always does something every Halloween, so he's having some fun.
Q.  When did he change the wardrobe?
JESPER PARNEVIK:  On 18th fairway.  He got the logos pretty good, he got the belt going.  Even the Swedish flag he got right.  He put some work into it.
