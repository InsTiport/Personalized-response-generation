 Q. Just a couple comments about your round today. Tough conditions out there. 
 JESPER PARNEVIK: I didn't play that great I have to say. Some tough pin placements and it was tough to get it close. I got off to a really rocky start. I bogeyed, I think, two of my first two holes, so 68, I'm happy with that.

 Q. You've had a tough year so far, yet coming back to a place where you've won, does that help? 
 JESPER PARNEVIK: I mean, I love playing here, of course. I've had great success here and in Texas before. I had a little bit of a lesson earlier in the week from Mike Abbott and then I saw DJ on Wednesday. He said I swung like -- the word I can't say, it starts with a P. He thought I should swing a little bit harder at it. So I hit balls for about three hours on the range just trying to speed up the body, and I think that has helped a little bit.

 Q. About last week, you had Lance out there playing, your caddie, and he bested you by three strokes. 
 JESPER PARNEVIK: Actually I was rooting for him. I was hoping he was going to make the cut. It was going to be such an amazing story, first of all, what he did, because I don't think many guys who play the TOUR can do what he did, carry the bag for 18 holes and go out and be 1-under after 15 holes. 
 Like I said, he beat me pretty bad. He has not given me much hard time about it yet, which I'm very happy about.

 Q. If he would have made the cut and you wouldn't have, would you have carried his bag? 
 JESPER PARNEVIK: I actually asked, but he said, "I don't want you on the bag, you're just going to mess things up for me."
