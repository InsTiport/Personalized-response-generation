   JESPER PARNEVIK: It was fun seeing the putts fall, trust me. My back is very bad, and I played horrifically. It's probably one of the best 3-under pars ever posted at Riviera.

 Q. Well, 25 putts will cover up a lot of guilty sins. 
 JESPER PARNEVIK: Yeah, it was a lot of good chip shots, a lot of really horrible shots. But I mean, hopefully I can play tomorrow, but I had hip surgery in August and things have really not worked out.

 Q. On the final hole after you hit the bunker shot and hit the green, I saw you bent over in the fairway. Is that your back or your hip?
 JESPER PARNEVIK: It's the back. I have a bad case of sciatica, and I don't know how to get rid of it yet. I've tried everything so far. I'm going to see the physios this afternoon, but 68 is a great score no matter what, but today was unbelievable actually.

 Q. Tell us about how the course is playing. 
 JESPER PARNEVIK: This is the best I've ever seen it. The shape of the course is unbelievable. The greens are -- I mean, the best I've pretty much seen any TOUR greens. For here at Riviera it's unbelievable.
