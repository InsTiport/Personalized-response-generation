 Q. Today's round, just let me talk to you a little bit about that, your form. You've got to be happy with 3-under. 
 JESPER PARNEVIK: Yeah, I've been getting close lately. I haven't really been able to do it, though. Today I felt like I played so-so and shoot 3-under, and then I go out there other days and think I play really well and I shoot 3-over. I cannot really pinpoint where I'm making mistakes. But it's more of a slow thing, I think. Confidence has to get there so I can stand up and just not guide it. Today that was my main focus. 
 DJ, I wouldn't say gave me a lesson yesterday, but he thought I was swinging like I was swinging it under water. He said more like a [expletive deleted], and I used to really rip through it. So he thought I should just go out there and really rip hard at it with the body. So I did that the last few hours on the range yesterday, which in one sense, it helped. I hit a lot of good shots that way today. 
 And he's right. I've been feeling like my speed has slowed down a lot since my hip surgery, and I think that's something I've got to work on.

 Q. Having won here in 2000, I mean, it seems such a long time ago. Does it seem like that for you?
 JESPER PARNEVIK: No, actually I would say it was about a couple years ago.

 Q. So do you draw on some of that memory?
 JESPER PARNEVIK: Yeah, I mean, it's very weird how -- like I saw Scott Verplank today and asked him when he won, and I asked him if he won the Canadian after he won here or before, and he said, "I won the Canadian in 2001." And I was like, "whoa." That was the year he got picked for the Ryder Cup.

 Q. He won at Royal Montreal?
 JESPER PARNEVIK: Yeah. It seems like everything -- just like everybody, everything seems like yesterday.
