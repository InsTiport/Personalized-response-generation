Q.  Do you plan on continuing playing over are you going to be playing more on the European Tour?
 
JESPER PARNEVIK:  I don't think I am.  I don't think I am going to rejoin the European Tour as a full member.  It is too tough of a schedule right now.  I wanted to give myself the full chance to play over here this year.  So, I think I am going to play mainly over here.  I am still going to go to Europe in about a month's time and play the PGA over there, I think, and play a few more in the summer. 
 

Q.  What is the status with your wife?  Is she in labor or --
 
JESPER PARNEVIK:  She is working on it.  (Laughs) No, but it is close.  We should have another child any day now.  It should be fun.  We already have one.  I think we are going to have another daughter.  So, it is a lot of fun. 
 

Q.  This just seems like another week on TOUR where you played quite well but kind of ran into a bus with Nicky.
 
JESPER PARNEVIK:  Yeah, he ran away with it.  I mean, he deserves it.  Looks like he played great this week.  And, especially with, you know, the draw he had, he played in the tough conditions all week.  And it is a great performance to shoot whatever he is going to shoot in the end.  But, it is a great week for him. 
 

Q.  You obviously played very well here over the weekend. Did everything click for you?
 
JESPER PARNEVIK:  Yeah, everything felt fine on the weekend.  I was plus 4 for the tournament, I think, during the second round.  And, so, I was really happy to, you know, to bring it back.
