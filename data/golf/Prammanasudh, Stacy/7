   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Stacy, thanks for joining us after your round.  You have a two-stroke lead over Lorena going into tomorrow's second round.  You matched your career low round with your performance out there today.  Do you want to talk about what was going right for you.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  You know, I fortunately put myself on the right side of the hole, you know, for the majority of the day, which gave my a good look at birdie.  I was putting well out there.  I wasn't feeling actually very confident over the putter yesterday, so luckily things turned around and I'm very pleased.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Can we go over your multitude of birdies?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I will try.  I don't remember these holes right now.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  There were several.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  They all blend together.  What was it, No.4?   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  4, 395 yards, Par 4.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Okay.  Let me get to 5 first because that's Par 5.  4 I believe -- yeah, I can't remember at all what I hit in.  4 I hit a pitching wedge to about ten or twelve feet.  No. 5, I hit a sand wedge to about two feet.   
 7 was -- oh, it was pouring down rain at that time.  I hit a 5-iron to about six or eight feet.   
 8 I just missed the green with my second so I had a little chip.  It was like a 7-footer.  9 was a 9-iron about six or eight feet again.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  11.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  This is just straightaway, isn't it?  I think it was a pitching wedge 18.  This is a tricky one, too.  14 I got lucky.  I hit my tee shot a little too far right and ended up down there.  I think I hit a three quarter gap wedge like three feet.   
 15 was a pitching wedge ten feet.  8-iron ten feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Just for curiosity, which holes were you playing in that downpour?  Where were you when it started?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Started on six green a little bit walking to 7 tee, and then we had to wait on 7 so luckily I was hitting in the downpour.  Then it subsided a little bit after that hole.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  After 7?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah.  Just a little break.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  We'll up open up for questions for Stacy.   
  
  Q.  You had a putt on 18 for 62.  Talk about that putt and obviously you knew what it meant.  When did you realize in the round it was a special day for you?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, you know, when I got to 5-under making the turn, you know, I told myself, I was just like, Don't sit on it.  You're playing well.  Just keep doing what you're doing.   
 I hit a couple errant tee shots once I made the turn, and my caddie slash husband commented that my ball position was a little off.  So I think that's really what got me back focused on just hitting good golf shots.  And so luckily it's all worked out.   
  
  Q.  Putt on 18?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Oh, putt on 18.  I thought it would move a hair right.  I played it just inside the hole and just eked there to the left.  I thought it was going move right and it didn't.   
  
  Q.  How far?  About (indiscernible).   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Are you still on your Solheim Cup high?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Actually, I think I'm just delirious at this point because I didn't get a lot of rest last week.  Didn't get in until late Wednesday and we had a little scare with my niece and spent all night in the emergency room.   
 Then I had friends in for the big football game and was in New York City over the weekend.  So there was no rest.  I got here Monday night, hit some putts, and came out Tuesday with full intentions of playing 18 holes.  Started hitting balls, and 30 minutes into it I was like, that will never happen.  Walked a few holes on the back.   
 But, I mean, you just got to know that that comes with the territory sometimes and you got to know your limits.  Luckily I didn't push myself on Tuesday and just once I saw the back -- I played the back 9 first and people were just saying, you know, it's pretty straightforward.  You'll be fine.   
 So I played the Pro-Am and luckily we were on carts so that was a blessing.  So, you know, just trying to make it through the week.   
  
  Q.  Great round.  Obviously you've got Lorena right behind you.  Talk about her streak and what it will be like to face her the way she's playing.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, I mean, there are three more rounds and anything can happen.  I got off to a great start, but I got to keep that going.  There are plenty of great players out here to win.   
 The greens are pretty receptive, and if they continue to be that way then the course should be relatively low.   
  
  Q.  Still a little groggy?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, I mean, I woke up this morning and got to the golf course and I still wasn't -- I mean, I think a little bit of the heat has to do with it, too.  But I was just like, Come on already.  So, you know...   
  
  Q.  How many 63s have you had in your career?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I think this is the third.  Two in professional golf and one in amateur.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Oh, that's not what I was thinking, but okay, I'll go with it.   
  
  Q.  Will you play in the morning tomorrow?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Hopefully it'll be a little cooler.   
  
  Q.  Get a little sleep tonight maybe?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Got to go grab a quick bite and sit down in front of the TV for Grey's Anatomy most importantly.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  My niece has multiple health issues.  She's six, just turned six, and she had her first seizure.  I hadn't been home but like 40 minutes.  Had it been an hour before that my sister would have been home alone with her.   
 We live a little bit -- it takes a while to get to the airport, so luckily we were all there and worked together.  But everything's fine and she's as healthy as she can be.  Just a little bit more susceptible to seizures now.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Same pairings tomorrow.  Right.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Thanks, Stacy.
