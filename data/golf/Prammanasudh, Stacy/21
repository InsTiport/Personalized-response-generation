PAUL ROVNAK:  Stacy, great round today, 6 under par 66 puts you at the top of the leaderboard.  No bogeys.  You birdied your first hole.  Talk about your day.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:   I actually got quite lucky on the first hole.  I drove it through the fairway just a little bit so I was in the rough.  I had a decent lie, but I caught it a little thin.  It didn't look like it was going to make it over the water at all.  It hit just short of the green and then jumped up.  Luckily I made birdie, so that set the tone for the day, I guess.  Just finished that nine with all pars.  Do you want me to go hole by hole?
PAUL ROVNAK:  We can go hole by hole at the end.

Do you guys have questions?
Q.  (No microphone.)
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Last week I struck the ball incredibly well and made absolutely nothing.  And so this week I was just trying to figure out my putter and hopefully things turn around.  I didn't strike the ball as well as I did last week today, but luckily I made up for it.
Q.  31 on your back nine, but the front nine.  What got you going?  Did you just get into a rhythm, what happened there?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  On 2, I chipped in.  And then I hit it close on 3.  You know, it's really scoreable out there.  The greens are very receptive.  So you can fly at the pins if you have perfect yardage.  If you can fly it at the hole, you can't have more then a 10 footer.  I feel it's a really good round, but there's still a lot of golf yet and it's a very scoreable golf course.
Q.  Have you played here in the past and how    it always seems to be soft.  This year might be softer.  Is it even easier to score this year than it has in the past?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It's always been pretty wet here, with rain or whatever.  It seems that it's always taken a pretty good number of birdies to get around here.
Q.  As you said, there is a lot of golf left.  But still to be sitting where you are after one round, does it change the way you approach the next day?  What does it do for you, I guess, to post a 66?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  There are three more rounds left and you've pretty much got to do this for three more days if you are going to take home the trophy.  I have to keep doing what I'm doing and that's all I can ask for.
Q.  You played the ball up on three holes.  Did either those holes or any of the other holes give you any problems with any of the conditions out there or not?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No.  Actually, I completely forgot about playing it up, so I didn't even touch my ball on those three holes.  No. 9, hello.  Our whole group forgot on 1, because we got to the green and thought, oh, we should have played it up.

I played a pretty errant shot on the par 5.  I was up by the cart path.  I was pin high in two and right at the top.  Three shots to get in for par, so it wasn't a huge mistake.
Q.  Was that because of mud or not?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No.  The ball is not really gathering mud.  We're playing it up on those holes because of the number of divots that are in the fairway.
Q.  You mentioned, to paraphrase, it's a very scoreable golf course.  So you're not getting real excited about where you're sitting right now, but do you think you'll be leading by the end of the day or not?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I think 6 under is a very good score.  I'm very pleased with the way I played.  But it didn't feel like I was going really low.  You know, you had shots in there    with a wedge in your hand you should be within 10 feet and putting for birdie, that kind of thing.  It's a great score.  I doubt that I would be the sole leader at the end of the day.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Take us over that scorecard, starting on No. 10.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No. 10 was a thin, skanky 8 iron to about 15 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 2, you chipped in.  What did you use?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I used a lob wedge.
PAUL ROVNAK:  From how far?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I was like 5 yards off the green.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Then No. 3.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  3 was a 9 iron to 10 or 12 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 7.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Pitching wedge to another 10 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 8.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  8 was an 8 iron to about 10 or 12 feet again.
PAUL ROVNAK:  No. 9.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  9 was a 5 iron to 35, 2 putt.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thanks, Stacy.
