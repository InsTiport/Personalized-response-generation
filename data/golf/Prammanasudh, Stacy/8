  Q.  Stacy, satisfying win today?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It was very satisfying.  I mean, I couldn't have asked for more, being my first Solheim and on foreign soil.  I'm just so excited.   
  
  Q.  Were you nervous today when the day started?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I was really not nervous all week.  I thought I would be so jittery, and I really wasn't.  I don't know if -- blessing in disguise, I guess.   
  
  Q.  What was the key to closing this out for you today?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  She bogeyed -- missed her par putt on 16.  That put me 1-up.  On -- on 18 I just hit a great second shot and kind of sealed the deal.   
  
  Q.  16, it seems like a lot of action was going on over there.  Annika called it the hardest hole on the golf course.  Is that true?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, because the wind is howling so hard from left to right.  If you have any cut spin on the ball at all, it's gone.  It played very difficult.   
  
  Q.  To be a part of this winning team, what does that feel like?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I mean, it's priceless.  Words can't even describe.  It's so much fun.
