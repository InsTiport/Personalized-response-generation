   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Thanks for joining us.  Another good solid round out there.  One stroke off the lead in tomorrow's final round.  Talk about how you played today. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It was definitely a lot windier when we started the day so it's playing more difficult.  I just wasn't hitting it as close as I had in the previous couple rounds, so my birdie chances weren't as much as the last couple rounds. 
 I'm pleased with the way I played.  Just bad lie off to the drive and resulted in a bogey one hole and then a little plug up on 18.  But other than that I'm pleased. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  You want to go over your birdies and bogeys, starting with the first bogey on hole 6. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  6 I just pulled my approach shot and I ended up 3-putting. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  How far? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  The first putt was probably 50 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Birdie on 8. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  8 I chipped up to about four or five feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Birdie on 10. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  About a 12-footer from just off the fringe. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  14. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  14 is where I hit a good drive, and it just kind of kicked up into the lip of the bunker and didn't have a good lie.  Had to kind of play out away from the hole a little bit and didn't get up and down.  I missed like an 8-footer. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: (Indiscernible.) 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  That was a 3-putt from about 12 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Questions for Stacy. 

 Q.  I notice on No. 17 you had a wood out looked like, and then you switched back to an iron.  What was the thought pattern on that? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, I mean the, the yardage was definitely a go yardage.  The lie where the ball was was fine, but it was my stance with my feet that was a little questionable. 
 At this point in the tournament there was no -- I mean, that pin was probably not acceptable with a 5-wood anyway to have a good look at an eagle putt anyway, so we decided to play safe.  I can still make birdie, you know, with a 9-iron in my hand. 

 Q.  More conservative approach. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Right. 

 Q.  What iron did you use on that? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  My perfect 9-iron yardage, and I either nuked it or hit it down slope, I'm not sure. 

 Q.  Five of Lorena's six wins this year have come from the front running position.  Talk about playing her tomorrow.  Looks like y'all are separated from the field a little bit.  Talk about the challenges of facing Lorena when she's on a roll like she is. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, you know, she is No. 1 in the world for a reason.  She's a great player.  But at the same time, she hasn't won them all. 
 We both have an equal shot of winning out there.  Depends what the conditions will be like tomorrow, but, you know, I'm playing well so I got to like my chances. 

 Q.  Her dominance invariably is compared to Tiger's dominance on the men's tour.  Is she too nice to have an intimidation factor? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  You know, you just admire her game.  She's a great player.  We've kind of grown up playing together, junior golf and a couple years in college, so she's always been around. 
 It's nice seeing her progress, and to be able to contend against somebody of her caliber is an honor. 

 Q.  You talked earlier in this the week about your hectic schedule and you were really tired.  Do you feel like you have enough gas to go tomorrow? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Definitely.  I don't have a choice of whether I have enough gas or not.  I feel fine.  Just a good dinner tonight and some rest.  We tee off probably around the same time we did today, so I'll get to sleep in a little bit and it'll all work out. 

 Q.  Not to talk too much about the 3-putt on the last hole, was it more the first putt getting away from you? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, I definitely did not -- was not trying to make it by no means, and I did not think I hit it that hard.  Just a miss judgment, I guess. 

 Q.  If you could order a day tomorrow to be ideal for your game, what would you want it to be?  What would you like the conditions to be? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I think the tougher the better, that way you don't have to go out there and force yourself to make birdies.  You just got to be rewarded for hitting good golf shots.
