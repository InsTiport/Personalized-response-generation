   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Stacy, Thanks for joining us today.  Another great round out there.  You concluded it with an eagle on your next to last hole.  You got a great lead going into the weekend.  Talk about what that feels like.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It feels great, you know, being this late in the year and playing this well.  I couldn't be more pleased.  I knew I had to play pretty good this week to secure a shot for the Samsung tournament in two weeks, so hopefully I can do that.  We'll see what happens this weekend.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Can we go over your scorecard?  Start with the birdie on third hole of the day, which was the 12th hole.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I honestly cannot remember what I hit.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Let's skip to 16.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  16 I hit a little 9-iron to about 12 feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  Bogey on 1.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Missed the green short left a little bit.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Birdie on 4.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  4 I hit 5-iron to about four feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  And the eagle on 8.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  8-iron, 15 feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  And the birdie on 12.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  12, yeah, that one again.  I want to say I hit a 4-iron in.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Questions for Stacy.   
  
  Q.  You had a three-shot head start when you started the day and had the chance to go out and set the early pace this morning.  Talk about how good it is to build on your lead and kind of jump way out in front of everybody and put pressure on the afternoon folks to maybe come after you?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  There still are two more rounds and the birdies are still out there definitely if somebody gets hot.  I was playing alongside Nicole today and she shot 6-under.   
 The birdies are definitely out there.  I just got to keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully stay on top.   
  
  Q.  You said you eagle was 8-iron in.  Was that playing downwind, or did you hit a big drive?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, you can cut off a great portion of the length of the hole by going over some of the mounds, and of course it was downwind, so...   
  
  Q.  I that had to be a big boost to jump from a 4- to a 6-shot lead or whatever.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Obviously I made a lot putts yesterday, and I was still hitting some good putts today they just didn't fall like though did yesterday.  Luckily the eagle fell, so I couldn't be happier.   
  
  Q.  Your strategy for the weekend with such a lead big lead, do you still have to keep making birdies or do you kind of see how things are going?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  With the strength of the field and I think it plays to an advantage for the longer hitters because they can carry a lot out there.  I think I definitely need to still be aggressive.  The greens are firming up a little bit out there.  I saw them watering right behind us.   
 Taking that into consideration, it's still very scorable.   
  
  Q.  Looked like the wind had picked up today.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  The wind was a little stronger.  Obviously it plays better on some of downwind holes.  But for the most part it wasn't a huge change.  The wind is not strong enough to really wreak havoc.   
  
  Q.  I believe you met with the prime minister of Thailand in New York, and Virada did, too.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Uh-huh.   
  
  Q.  Did he say something to inspire you this week?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I don't know.  But the certificate that he gave us is giving us good luck, huh?  She is playing great and it's good to see.   
  
  Q.  Everybody else is playing about even golf today.  What are you doing?  Do you just like this course, or is putting your game?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I cannot complain about my putting whatsoever.  But the golf course, there's not a whole lot of trips out there.  The rough isn't terribly penalizing.  You can get bad lies, but the fairways are pretty generous.   
 An average length hitter, we can carry a lot of the of corners and cut off some distance, so you're hitting shorter clubs in than other people that can't carry it quite as far.   
 So I'm not saying I'm a long hitter by no means, but on the holes where you can take advantage of cutting off some yardage I think that helps.   
  
  Q.  You said yesterday you were just trying to get through the week because you were so tired.  Does having a 6-shot lead kind of give you little will to go on?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Oh, definitely.  I mean, that helps.  It is a long week.  It is for everybody.  Just got you know stay within myself and know my limits and get some rest and keep doing what I'm doing.
