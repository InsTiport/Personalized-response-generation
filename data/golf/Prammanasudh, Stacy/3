   THE MODERATOR:  Congratulations, Stacy.  You're defending champion.  This is your second win, and last year I know it was a little more special because your husband, Pete, was on the bag with you.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, you know, last year was Pete's first year out working for me, so to be able to get a win this early in the season was great.  We love Hawaii, so hopefully we'll have a good week.   
 THE MODERATOR:  Not a bad place to come back to.   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Not at all.  We got married in Kauai, so Kauai is special to us.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I would think it would just kick start the year.  It obviously got me some momentum going forward and added a lot of confidence playing the next week in Mexico.  It just started the year off really good.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, I think I just had -- you know, on this golf course you have to make birdies.  I was putting well last year, and I'll go out there and work on it again this year and see where it takes me.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Right.  You know, I mean, I had another lesson in the off-season.  We're still working on some things.  I played all right last week.  Nothing great.   
 Made a couple mental errors, but it's coming around.  As long as the putter works I think we'll be okay.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, Ko Olina is a little more open and more forgiving off the tees.  All the Par 5s are reachable, so it's definitely a scorer's golf course.  The grain comes into play a little bit more on the greens than at Turtle Bay.   
 All in all, it's just going to be about making birdies.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No.  Every week, uh-uh.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 THE MODERATOR:  What's it like on the back 9?  You've got a stretch there of Par 4, Par 5, Par 5, Par 4.  What kind of a mental toughness, or what is that like playing physically?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Those two Par 5s are both reachable, so if you're making pars on those you got to think you're giving a stroke to the rest of the field.   
 So you definitely have to take advantage of the Par 5s out here, I think.  And, you know, if I can hit it close on the short Par 4s with a wedge you got to at least give yourself birdie opportunities.  The scores last year were very low and they're not anticipating a whole lot of wind this week.  Got to make a lot of birdies.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Oh, yeah, definitely, especially going out in the morning:  Fresh greens, no wind.  When I played -- I didn't play yesterday, but when I was out there on Monday they were pretty receptive.  Shoot right at the flag.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, I don't remember every shot I hit last year, you know, I was just focusing on what I had to do and playing good golf.   
 You know, but when you pull into the resort you get a special feeling about, oh, well, last year I played well.  So, I mean, you have a little extra confidence knowing that you have played well on this golf course before.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Oh, last year we went to dinner and our flight was like at 11:30 that night to go back home.  It's very good.   
 You know, I mean, I do a lot of my own yardages, too.  So I rely on him as a reaffirmation of everything that I'm coming up with as far as yardages and what I think of club selection.   
 I do a lot of it myself, more than other girls that rely mainly on their caddies.  It's more comfort out there, really, someone to talk to.  I'm not a big talker on the golf course, but someone just to keep you loose.  Basically it's more fun traveling.  You enjoy it more.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Always.  I mean, every year our talent gets deeper and deeper out here.  You just know that going in, that you got to work hard and focus on what you have to do to get the ball in the hole.   
 Annika a playing well.  She's healthy.  Just won last week.  Luckily we're paired together.  Should make for a great week.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  On a golf course like this, you have no idea, I mean, because it doesn't suit anybody's game.  I can hit it anywhere and you got to make birdies.  You can make birdies from 50 yards off the fairway.   
 On a golf course like this you don't really know who you anticipate playing well.  Obviously she's won 70 times; there's a reason for that.  But it is anybody's golf course.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, there's 18 holes less than we normally play throughout the season, so that first round is very important.  If you don't get off to a good start you're trying to play catch up for the next two, and there's not a whole a lot of golf out there on a golf course that's very scorable.   
 THE MODERATOR:  All right.  Thank you very much.  Look for a repeat.
