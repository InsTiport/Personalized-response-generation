 Q.  Talk about your day. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  17 I was between clubs and I knew long wasn't an option, so I chose the shorter club and I just mishit it. 
 So it left me too far away from the hole and obviously didn't get up and down. 

 Q.  Overall your play today? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I struck the ball really well today.  I haven't felt really great with the putter the last few weeks, I guess I'll work on that this afternoon. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible). 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No, same color kind of but not the same outfit.  If I was going to do that I would wear it on Sunday. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible). 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, you know, I hit it relatively close on a couple holes.  Took the long way around this golf course, and the wind started to pick up and couple of those holes on the back played really well.  You just have to be patient out there. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible). 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  They moved the pins on a couple tees, so that helps.  But you just know you're not going get any roll.  I hit I don't know how many rescues; we all did.  Lorena is pretty long off the tee.  It's long for everybody. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible). 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Ten, seven.  I think that's it. 

 Q.  I think it was three. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Three?  Yeah, three. 

 Q.  The other day you we're talking about your goal was 3-under per day, and obviously you didn't meet that goal today.  How do you make up for that? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Shoot 6-under tomorrow and another 6-under on Sunday and see what that gets me. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible). 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, you know you're going to miss greens.  You know you miss a couple green here and there.  Just got work on getting up and down.
