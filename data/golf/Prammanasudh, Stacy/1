 Q. Nothing better than starting a round with an eagle?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH: Yeah, yeah, well, Karen did it in the final round and unfortunately my came too early. 

 Q. What happened on that hole?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH: I hit 5-wood to about six feet. 

 Q. And the birdies were coming every third hole. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH: Oh, really? I just try to make them when I can. I don't know how they progress. 

 Q. Your putting felt good? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH: Yeah, I finally adjusted my grip a little bit before I went out. 
 I've been struggling this year with my putting, and I felt really good over it, especially making the first putt down the first hole helped. 

 Q. How have your results been goig this year?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH: I've been striking the ball very well this year, and just not getting a lot out of my rounds and unfortunately been struggling with my putting, but hopefully they have come together for one week. 

 Q. Were some of the later holes tougher than the earlier ones?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH: Yeah, the back does play tougher. The front is shorter and starting with two reachable par 5s, you should be a few under on the front, anyways, you hope, and just try to make good shots on the back and birdies when you can.

 Q. What happened on 17? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH: I made my tee shot just a bit left. I guess it kicked pretty hard and went through the fairway a little bit, and I didn't have a shot to the green and chipped up and thought I made the putt for par, but not quite enough speed. 

 Q. What as the adjustment of the grip?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH: I adjusted the position of my left hand a little bit.
