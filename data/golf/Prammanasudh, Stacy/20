PAUL ROVNAK:  Stacy, a great 67 out there today.  Right now Lorena is still on the course.  She has a couple shot advantage on you, but going into tomorrow you should have a good look at the tournament.  Go ahead and talk about your day.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It will be interesting to see, because Ai Miyazato and I both shot 67 today, so it will be interesting to see what the pairings will be tomorrow.  But I put myself here and I just have to try to go out and do my best tomorrow and keep doing what I'm doing.
PAUL ROVNAK:  We'll go ahead and take questions.
Q.  The best part of your game today?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It was kind of all around just okay.  I made putts when I needed to, just one mistake on a par 5.  I just made bogey there, so it wasn't    kind of a ho hum day.  When I hit it close, I made the birdie.
Q.  Your whole week it seems like you played pretty steadily, not getting into too much trouble and not doing anything really too spectacular.  Have you had an eagle yet?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No.
Q.  Is this the consistency you've been looking for?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  The fairways are quite generous out there, and the greens are very receptive, so it's going to play for lower scores.  It's hard to get in a lot of trouble unless you just really knock one crazy.  I just tried to say consistent.
Q.  What kind of front runner is Lorena?  Do you have any experience in chasing her?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  We've competed all through college, her two years of college, and then here in the LPGA.  We both have been around, and obviously she's been having a great year so she's going to be a tough competitor to beat.  With the weather coming in, you never know.  It's anybody's game.
Q.  Who is on the bag for you?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  My dad.
Q.  Is that normal?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yes.
Q.  His name?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Lou.
Q.  Are you a scoreboard watcher?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  A little bit today.  There's still so much golf left to be played.  It really didn't come into my mind that much about the scoreboard today.
Q.  The players that played in the afternoon yesterday talked about the course getting faster and changing with the dryer conditions.  Did you have to play differently today than you did the first two days?  Is it allowing for any more roll with the ball?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, I played in the morning yesterday, so it played pretty much the same for me both days.  This morning, on No. 3, all three of us almost drove it too far.  I was through the fairway into the rough, almost in the rough.  We definitely did not expect to be down there that far.  So it is drying out a little bit and running out.
Q.  Did you have to make a mental adjustment at that point to try to remember this was a little bit of a new course you were playing instead of the one you were playing the first two days?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Not a whole lot, because on that hole it's a little more downhill.  It just depends on the wind and what yardage you want to be at really.
Q.  We don't know a lot about you.  With your name, do you get, I assume, mistaken for being from Asia or anything like that or not?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No, not really.  A lot of people just don't know the origin of the name.  That's always a question, "Where are you from?" type thing.
Q.  Do you get back there?  You're from Oklahoma?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I've been once, when I was nine, so it's changed quite a bit in 17 years.
Q.  A little history.  How did your dad
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  He came over to the States in '66.  He will be 68 in October.  He couldn't afford to play golf back in Thailand, just watched from a park close to the golf course.  He met my mom, and when he had my sister and I, we went out as a family and he got myself and my sister into it in hopes we would stick with it for college scholarship purposes.  He pushed a little bit, but it didn't take a whole lot.  That's the background there.
Q.  So he couldn't afford it over in Thailand?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH: No.  He didn't have any money growing up either.  I just played local qualifiers that qualified you for like the Maxfli and PubLinks and things like that to play in national events.  I didn't play in AJGA events or anything like that.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Take us over your scorecard today.  Start with the bogey on 4.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I didn't bring it in here.  Bogey on 4 was the par 5.  5 wood a little lefty, jumped into the hazard, took a drop, didn't get up and down, 6.
Q.  Birdie on 8, the par 3?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  8 was a 7 iron to about 25 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  9, the par 5.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  9, I hit a 3 iron just on the fringe, two putt.
PAUL ROVNAK:  How far do you think the first putt was?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  30, 35 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  11, the par 5.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  11, I was just off the green in two.  I chipped on, one putt from 6 or 8 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  13.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  13, was a pitching wedge to 6 or 8 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  16.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  16, gap wedge to 8 feet.
PAUL ROVNAK:  18, the last hole.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  A very lucky blocked 6 iron to about 8 feet again.
Q.  I wanted to ask you, talk about your college golf program.
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I went to the University of Tulsa.  I graduated in '02.  It's always been a really strong program since I can remember.  We went through a coaching change after my sophomore year.  And Melissa McNamara, who is Bill's daughter, I had her for my last two years.  And now I think they've gone through two more coaches since.  And I don't know that the program is as strong now.  But I loved college, it was great, a great experience as far as competition.  I wouldn't have traded it for anything.
Q.  Just looking at your card, was there anything that happened after seven holes to create all the birdies in the last 11?  It just looked like you were quiet for the start of the round and then all of a sudden, 6 of the last 11 you birdied?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No. 9, you can pretty much guarantee a birdie unless you don't get a good drive.  You just have to stay patient out there.  As long as you give yourself chances, you're bound to make one or two here and there.
Q.  You talked about watching the leaderboard a little.  Did you notice Lorena and tell yourself at all, I have got to do something if I want to stay in touch?
STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No, because I mean you know other people are going to be out there making birdies.  You can't force yourself to make birdies.  If you try to force things then it's going to go in the opposite direction.

Lorena led the Tour last year, I think, in birdies, so you know she's going to post a good score.  You just have to go out there and stick to your own game.
