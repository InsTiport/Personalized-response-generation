   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Stacy, thanks for joining us.  Your first time back in the States after the Solheim Cup, and you followed it up with some more great play. 
 Talk about what it feels like to come away and do this out here. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah.  It feels really good.  I played great all week.  Just a couple bobbles here and there.  You've got to expect that.  You know, it's not a sprint it's a marathon. 
 Luckily I played well early on.  And to even get myself in this position to play in the last group the last two days is great. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Can we go over your scorecard, starting with the bogey on the 2nd hole. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No. 2, Par 3.  I hit a great shot, it just ended up short and I missed about a 10-footer for par. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  The birdie on 3. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  3 I believe I hit a 9-iron to about three feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  Followed with a birdie on 4. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  4 was another 9-iron.  I would have to say that's about 30 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Very nice putt.  The bogey on 6. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  6 I missed my drive right so really I had no chance as going at the pin.  Missed about a 5-footer for par. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  Birdie on 8. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  8 I chipped up to about a foot. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  How far out that was chip shot? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Just off the fringe, so it was probably four feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  Birdie on 12. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  12 was a 9-iron to about 12 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  And the bogey on 15. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  That was a 3-wiggle from twenty feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  All right.  Questions. 

 Q.  I guess it was the 15th where you felt, looking back, like you let it slip away. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, definitely.  I thought I hit a good putt, and it obviously broke more and just kept taking the break.  I had a good second putt.  Just broke more than I thought. 
 You know, I mean, you look back on it and you make some and you miss some, so you can't be upset. 

 Q.  Talk about the 17th.  That's where everything changed.  You were in good position for a birdie and take the lead and Maria made it in front of you.  Talk about the drama of the 17th and 18th there. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Well, I mean, Lorena birdied 16 to get to 1 back.  You know, 17 is a rich reward hole.  If you get down there in position off the tee you can go for it in two like Lorena did. 
 I didn't feel it was necessary, and I assume Maria didn't feel that way either.  We both laid up.  She made her putt off the green, which was a great putt, and mine broke more than I thought. 

 Q.  How far was the putt on 18? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It was about a 20-, 25-footer, and I hit a good putt.  I just didn't see it going back left at the end.  I thought if anything it was going to go back right. 
 But, you know, gave it a good effort and I can't be upset about things. 

 Q.  Talk about Maria.  It's obviously been a long time since she's won out here.  I don't know if you faced her in the Solheim Cup.  Talk about her as a player and her job today that she did. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  She is obviously a great player.  She's been out here a few more years than I have.  Since I've come out she's always been a top 30 player. 
 So I did face her and Annika at Solheim.  Angela Stanford and I played her.  She strikes the ball and plays well, and if she gets her putter going then it's a good round for her.  This course obviously suits her well just because she can use length to her advantage.  She does hit it quite long off the tee. 
 She had very -- didn't have a 5 on her scorecard all day today, so it just shows you how the Par 5s play.  Definitely easier for someone that hits it significantly longer than the rest of us.
