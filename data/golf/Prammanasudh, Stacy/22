STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I'm glad it all came together.
Q.  You hung in there.  It's hard to make pars on an Open course when you have to chip and putt your way to do it.
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  You know you're going to make bogeys; bogeys are out there.  It's pretty much unavoidable not to have a bogey, so you just have to be patient and make as many pars as you can.
Q.  Did you have a sense of where you stood out there?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  No, I did not today.  When I went to Nashville I was a leaderboard watcher.  But this was the first time in this position at a major, and so I was comfortable at where I was.  And I felt comfortable on the golf course, so I didn't want to look to change my emotions.
Q.  How tough is it to play 36 in one day?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It's very tough.  It's more mentally tough than anything.  Everybody can swing the golf club, but it's maintaining yourself long enough to get through the 15 hour day or whatever we've had.
Q.  Saying that, do you think it was easier to be where you were after three rounds having to play 36 holes and not having to sleep on it?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  You know, I don't know.  I didn't get much sleep last night because I finished late yesterday anyways.  So, you know, I can't really say.  It's the U.S. Open and you just try to go out and do your best.
Q.  What do you take away from this experience?
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Just knowing that I'm able to control myself on the golf course.  I know I can do it.  I know    in the back of my mind I knew I was in contention.  I knew I could have been leading at some point during the day, and just to know that I've got it in me.
