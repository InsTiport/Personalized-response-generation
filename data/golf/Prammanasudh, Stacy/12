  Q.  What was the turning point for you?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  You know, we both putted really well.  We both made putts on top of each other when we had to and we actually made one or two mistakes, but I made a couple of birdies on the back.   
  
  Q.  Who holes were those at?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I birdied 12, and then she bogeyed 9 so I won that with a par and I birdied 12.   
  
  Q.  What did you do with the birdie on 12?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I had a sand wedge to about five feet.   
  
  Q.  So was that what really seized it for you right there?    
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I went 2-up there.  I won -- we tied 13 -- I think I was 3-up at that time.   
  
  Q.  How was your game?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I hit some pretty straight shots on the front nine but I was putting well today.   
  
  Q.  So that was the difference?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Oh, definitely.   
  
  Q.  How does this course set up for you match-play-wise?  Fits your eye and your game?   
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, I draw the ball in the holes, the a draw is a better shot.  So in that aspect it's good.  With the greens being soft, you've got to be aggressive and you can throw it right at the pin, just give yourself a putt.
