Q. Jessica, only the second time since you've been pros you've played together.
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it is.  It was a fun round today.  Interesting, actually.
NELLY KORDA: I wouldn't say fun; interesting.
Q. Jess, you got off to a horrible start and a couple of pars and a nine at the third.  Did Nelly put her arm around you and give you some consoling words?
JESSICA KORDA: No.  She was kind of laughing, like, "Well, at least it's not a ten."
NELLY KORDA: I was like, "At least you kept it in the single digits."
Q. And I believe you had to hole a 15-footer, as well.
JESSICA KORDA: I did.  It was a very interesting hole.  I'll be most improved tomorrow.
Q. Both finishing at 1-under par.  What's it like playing together?  Is it in some ways a distraction?
JESSICA KORDA: I really enjoyed it.  It's weird because when we play together, we read putts at home -- I think we had a good time.
NELLY KORDA: I mean, she's my best friend.  So we have everything to talk about.  We talk about pretty much everything.
Q. Did you have any thoughts about what you're planning for dinner this evening?
JESSICA KORDA: I was like -- no, after we birdied 18, I was like, let's play together tomorrow.  And I'm like, oh, no.
NELLY KORDA: I remember that.  I was like, when I was over my chip, I was like, "Let's go, I need to get it in."
JESSICA KORDA: She almost did, too.
NELLY KORDA: Just kidding.  I'm happy to be playing with her.
Q. Your first year on Tour, Nelly, how much reassurance is it having Jessica out here?
NELLY KORDA: I mean, having her out here has made things a lot easier.  It's made me more comfortable.  As I said before, she's my best friend.  So having her out here has been a blast this year.
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it is.  Good answer.  It is nice.  She makes her birdie, give her a little fist pump.  It's just the comfort of it.  It's just so nice.
