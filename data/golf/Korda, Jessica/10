  Q. 1-over, 72, to get things going here at the U.S. Open.  Cypress playing a little tougher than Jackrabbit today.  What were you pleased with, what were you disappointed with in round one today?
 JESSICA KORDA:   I mean, it was very stressful to be out there today.  It was gusting and then the greens were really firm.  We were coming in with pretty long clubs, so it was just trying to guess.
 I had a lot of shots that carried farther than I thought and released a lot more than I thought and put myself in some bad situations.
 But nonetheless, we just kept fighting and trying to keep to our plan of just hitting it to the fatter parts of the green and trying to two-putt as much as we can.
 It's tough.  The greens are massive and it's playing tough.  It's a U.S. Open.
 Q. Four birdies on your closing nine to keep that nine in a really good spot.  How excited are you for tomorrow and hopefully the weekend?
 JESSICA KORDA:   I mean, you can't win and lose it the a first day, right?  Just trying to keep myself in it.  Never played a U.S. Open with two golf courses, so hopefully the weather is kind to us tomorrow like it was for the girls over there, I guess.
 We'll see what happens.
 Q. Lastly, as somebody who has grown up admiring the game of golf, played in this championship many times, what does the U.S. Women's Open mean to you?
 JESSICA KORDA:   It means a lot.  This is kind of where I realized this is what I want to do.  13 years later, I guess to be out here still going strong, it's really nice.  It's just a nice reminder and very grounding, that's for sure.
