Q. You made a move on moving day. Happy with the way you played out there?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, definitely. I mean, apart from two holes I probably had a chance to make birdie on almost every single hole out there today; that was really positive.
So, yeah, just happy with the round.
Q. What's your take on this golf course and how does it set up for you?
JESSICA KORDA: It sets up really well for me. I think today was the first day we've had with less wind. Also was in the windiest wave that we had, so it was nice to see the golf course kind of a little bit more gettable today.
But, yeah, happy with my round.
Q. You put yourself in a good position heading into the final round. What is your game plan for tomorrow?
JESSICA KORDA: Birdies tomorrow. It all depends on how windy it is tomorrow and where they place the pins. This is a tough course with the way the greens are set up.
It's just going to be -- hopefully I can hit the ball as well as I did today and give myself as many opportunities.
Q. Solheim Cup is on a lot of people's minds this week. How much are you kind of following who is going to be your teammate?
JESSICA KORDA: Not really. Once I knew I made it was kind of just done.
Q. Well how nice is it to be playing well then with that coming up?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it's great. Just one week at a time. We all know what it takes to be on the team, and right now I just feel bad for Juli and all the girls kind of hoping to be a pick. That's not the a position you want to be in.
But they had all year to make it, so at the same time, just -- it's a tough day I think for Juli.
