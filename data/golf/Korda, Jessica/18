 Q.  So it was a really good battle between the two of you today.  
JESSICA KORDA: Not really, but okay.   
 Q.  It was. It was made for great television. It was match play back and forth between the two of you. That's what it looked like.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah. Sure. (Laughter.)   
 Q.  So maybe not the way you wanted to play today though.  
JESSICA KORDA: I just didn't have any like good numbers. I couldn't get anything going. Everything was half shots. I was either short or I was long.   
You know, just couldn't get anything going today. It was just one of those days where it just wasn't meant to be, I guess.   
But if you were going to tell me at the start of the week I would've come out finishing second, play in the final group, and had the week I did I would've probably taken it, but this one definitely sucks.   
 Q.  Yeah. Doesn't get easier I would imagine. What do you take from it, though?  
JESSICA KORDA: Nothing right now. You know, maybe next week I'll think back and obviously probably be proud. Just didn't have my A Game this week. Rusty obviously with a lot of shots. Just slowly making my way back and excited for the next two weeks out.   
 Q.  Did you two plan to dress alike today?  
JESSICA KORDA: No. This was -- we had a feeling that we were going to -- it was going to happen, and then when it did, we kind of saw each other on the putting green. We were like, What top are you wearing? We're both like, Great. Same yardage book, same hat.   
 Q.  Great minds thinking alike.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah.   
 Q.  At least you both know you have good taste.  
JESSICA KORDA: Exactly. We knew that one of these outfits were going to win today.   
 Q.  I know it's tough, but she played a great round. What's it like playing alongside that?  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, no, she played really solid I feel like yesterday and today. Obviously didn't see her second round.   
But she didn't let me if in at all. Se didn't make any mistakes. Every up and down she made. She played flawless. If she made a mistake she was right there almost chipping out.   
I just didn't have an opening, and when I did have one I just didn't capitalize. That's just how sometimes it goes.   
 Q.  You learn and move on.  
JESSICA KORDA: It sucks.   
 Q.  See you in Korea.  
JESSICA KORDA: Thanks.
