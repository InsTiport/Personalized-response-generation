 Q.   All things considered, an okay tournament for you?   How did you feel?   
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, it's a top 10, so I'm not going to complain about that.   Definitely a little bit disappointed with the bogey on the last hole, but it happens for a reason, so it will keep me motivated for next time.  
   
 Q.   How did you compare this course in difficulty to most of the other courses on Tour and most of the other major venues?   
JESSICA KORDA:   Well, this is my sixth U.S. Open, so I would say that this one had, by far, the hardest greens and it was the windiest out of all of them, playing Oakmont and stuff like that, but I only got to play 36.   That was the only cut I missed.   
I would say by far I had so many in‑between clubs these last two days, and you're just standing there and you're like you don't know what this ball's going to do.   Is it going to sit?   Is it going to go?   Is the wind going to take it?   It's pretty mentally draining out there?  
   
 Q.   So you see Inbee shooting 9‑ or 10‑under.   Did you even see that out there?   
JESSICA KORDA:   No, I thought 6 would win it, definitely.   Out here, if you hit it on the right spots and you can roll some putts in, I mean, I've played so much golf this year with Inbee.   She hit it's in the right spots and she rolls those putts so well.   Then her short game is unbelievable.  
   
 Q.   You are a very international person, a global person, and you understand how global this game is.   What do you think about the importance of a U.S. Women's champion to getting more of a spotlight on the LPGA?   
JESSICA KORDA:   I think the LPGA now considers themselves a global Tour.   We have a bunch of events out in Asia and a couple in Europe, a lot of our players are from around the world.   It's not just U.S. players anymore.   So in terms of growing the game of golf worldwide, I think that everybody's doing a great job just promoting golf and playing great golf, you see Inbee‑‑ you know, all I can say is you can see Inbee.   
But I think, definitely, if an American were to win a major, it would spark probably magazine in the younger juniors.   Regardless, I hope this still sparks something in junior golfers.   We're all trying to do our best out there, and having fun with the game of golf.   It's a game at the end of the day, and you want to be able to go out and kind of call this your job and let it be a game.  
   
 Q.   You were sitting third quite a bit today.   Were you aware of that?   
JESSICA KORDA:   No.  
   
 Q.   Not looking at the board at all?   
JESSICA KORDA:   I still have no idea where I'm at.   It's tough to kind of look to the side when it's blowing quite hard and you're trying to concentrate on where the wind is coming from and what yardage you want to grab.   It's not easy out there today or yesterday.  
   
 Q.   I know this is an individual sport, but are you a pretty proud big sister with what your little sister was able to do making the cut and everything?   
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, I'm just so proud she made the cut.   I think that was one of her goals coming in.   She had a great group.   She had so much fun out here.   Every day she brought some story back, and she was like this is so cool.   And today she made an eagle on the 4th hole, and I came up to the 4th hole thinking oh, yeah, it's going to be a nice 3‑wood into there, and I hit driver and didn't even come close to the green.   So I was like, okay, she hit that pretty good.   
But I'm just glad that she had a great time out here, and hopefully it's the first of many for her.  
   
 Q.   You have a stretch now with another major and then Solheim coming up.   Can you maybe talk about the next five to six weeks and how big that still is for you?   
JESSICA KORDA:   I think rest is going to play a huge impact in that.   Rest, practice, eat, sleep, enjoy it.
