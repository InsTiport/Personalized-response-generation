Q. Eight birdies and an eagle to cap off for a 10-under round.  I think that's a good round.
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, that was a pretty good round, pretty special.  I kept feeding off Brooke and Brit.  Couldn't have asked for a better pairing there.  Just had a lot of fun doing it.
Q. What got into you today?  Other than that.  I mean, was the putter hot?  Where were you feeling well out there on the course?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, there were definitely some off-season swings that happened, and I'm sure that some of them are documented.  So I was very thankful for a good putter today, and going to try and keep it hot for the next two days.
Q. You said it's been ten years since you shot ten-under.  Tell us about that feeling?
JESSICA KORDA: The fact that it's been ten years; 2008 feels like four years ago.  No, it's pretty cool.  I had my dad on the bag back then, and having a new caddie this week, it's pretty cool.
I didn't know it was happening.  I wasn't really looking at the leaderboard or what I was at on the day, which is usually how these things happen.  Honestly, we had fun out there and just let the birdies flow.
Q. Well, since the Sally in 2008; 2018 in Thailand.  It's a pretty good number for you.  Congratulations.
JESSICA KORDA: Thank you.  It is a good number.
