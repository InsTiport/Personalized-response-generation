Q. Sum up your day for us.
JESSICA KORDA: Good.
Q. Any details?
JESSICA KORDA: Nope.  You know, just hit some fairways, made some putts.  I didn't do anything special today.  Just made some putts.
Yesterday I made a double, so kind of hurt my scorecard.  Other than that, been playing pretty good these last two days.
Q. How do you like this style of golf where there is pressure to make birdies?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, I mean, you know what it's like coming.  Last year I missed the cut out here because I didn't make enough.  I have always played pretty well here, but it is definitely a 100-yards-and-ingame.
Q. How do you feel about the state of your game at this point of the season?
JESSICA KORDA: I freely pretty good.  Been putting some good numbers together.  I got sick in Singapore, so I'm still recovering from that a little bit.
Just plugging along.
Q. Was it like the flu?
JESSICA KORDA: Nobody knows what it was.  They put me on antibiotics on Friday, but I didn't play a practice round and showed up on Thursday.  Actually showed up to play eight holes I think on Friday.
Q. So kind of a bug or virus?
JESSICA KORDA: Nobody knew.  I had just a really bad throat, like really, really bad throat.  Couldn't drink or eat.  I had body aches but no fever.  I didn't have a cold.
It was really weird.  And I had a really bad cough at the end of the week.  Who knows?
Q. How are you feeling now?
JESSICA KORDA: I feel better.  Obviously allergies here, so can't catch a break.  I know that these three weeks are really bad for me in terms of allergies.
It is what it is.
Q. Is there anything you're working on today in order to prepare for the weekend?
JESSICA KORDA: Nope.  Same thing:  just going to go warm down a little bit.  I'm really hungry, so going to go eat and that's about it.  Go hang out with my sister.
