 Q.  How did you find the course compared to the rest of the week?  
JESSICA KORDA: The greens were a lot faster and firmer.  You could see that they were a lot -- like pretty burned out, and obviously from the wind that we've had.  Other than that, it was a good day.   
 Q.  This is going to be one of your best finishes in quite a while.  How does that motivate you for the last tournament of the season?  
JESSICA KORDA: Honestly I'm just happy to be playing somewhat pain-free.  Being back from injury is all I can ask for.   
 Q.  Would you say you are 100 percent pain-free?  
JESSICA KORDA: No.   
 Q.  Anything maybe looking ahead just to CME, expectations?  
JESSICA KORDA: None. Exactly the same amount of expectation coming into any event.
