 Q.   I'm now joined by our second leader, Jessica Korda.   Jess, awesome round again today, 5‑under, 68.   You have a two‑shot lead.   You didn't feel any burden with the lead coming into today.   Just take us through your round, how you felt out there.   
JESSICA KORDA:   I started a little slow today, but all in all I think it was a great day.   I putted really well, just kind of did the same things I was doing the first day.   A little different score, but I'm not really disappointed with that.  
   
 Q.   Now, a little higher scores today, not as many low, but scoring conditions, everyone said they saw you and Na Yeon go out 9‑under and thought there's birdies to be had here, so does that kind of give you a little bit more motivation knowing you have to go low today?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I wouldn't say that I knew I had to go low today.   I knew the golf course really suits my eye and I knew that I can make some birdies, and I had a lot of birdie opportunities out there.  
It was more I think today the sun wasn't really out, and the temperatures were a little different, so the ball just traveled through the air a little differently than we were used to, a little shorter, but all in all I think it was a great day, and I really like the golf course.  
   
 Q.   Now, I just talked to Stacy.   She said you guys will most likely play tomorrow together hopefully.   She said you guys have become very good friends.   You mentioned yesterday kind of looking up to her as a role model.   Just talk about your guys' relationship and how big of a role she's played in your career.   
JESSICA KORDA:   I definitely think she's one of the players that has taken me under her wing, especially right before Solheim and kind of during Solheim.  
But her play the last two, three years has been so impressive.   I actually was at the U. S. Open that she almost one in Interlachen, I think, and ever since then she's kind of been dominating on the tour.   And like I said, just really impressed with her, and hopefully we'll play tomorrow, so it'll be fun.  
   
 Q.   Great first two days.   Good luck the rest of the way.   
JESSICA KORDA:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   Long putts.   Anything super long, super short?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I don't really remember.   Just go and forget.  
   
 Q.   You felt better on the greens than yesterday?  
JESSICA KORDA:   They were a little bit bouncier today, I think, but I think all in all they were in good shape.  
Like I said, I think it's the smog that's coming in right now, it's making it heavy, and it's harder to breathe out there.   You cough a lot.   
   
 Q.   Embracing the leader role going into having the lead after two?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I don't know.   Am I in the lead.  
   
 Q.   I think so.   I'll check on it.   But feeling good on it?  
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, definitely.   It's a two‑shot lead.   Like I said, it's not a sprint.   It's a marathon, so we got two more days left.   We'll see what it looks like after day three and then we'll see what it looks like after day four.
