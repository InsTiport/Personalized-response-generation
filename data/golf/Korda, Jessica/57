JESSICA KORDA: It's an incredible thing to be able to win again.  I haven't won in two years.  And who knows?  It's so hard out here.  These girl are so good.  I mean, look at the scoreboard.  I had to shoot 25-under just to win.   
I just came with no expectations after surgery.  It's really hard for me to move.  All this stuff is just still really hard, but I'm really, really happy that I chose to come back in this event exactly where I started my rookie year in 2011.  I don't think I could have asked for a better win.   
 Q.  You're doing great.  You had a pretty rough off-season with a double jaw surgery in a while until this week.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, this is the most holes I've played in a row since CME.  I didn't know how I was going to do.  I was just coming in here just happy to be able to play and be able to be back out.   
I've missed it.  It was hard sitting home watching everyone on TV.   
 Q.  How do you plan on celebrating this sweet victory?  
JESSICA KORDA: Also it's my 25th birthday on Tuesday, so this is a good birthday present for myself.  It's my caddie's birthday today, so happy birthday Collin.  (Applause).   
So, I don't know.   
 Q.  All right.  Thank you.
