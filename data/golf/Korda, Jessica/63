 Q.  I know you wanted the win, but you've got to be happy with the way you ended your season here at CME.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah.  Can we continue the season?   
Obviously kind of sucks that I couldn't get into the playoff, but played my heart out today; best I could have done.   
Happy with the last two finishes I had.  Going to enjoy the off-season and get healthy.   
 Q.  What are your plans for the off-season?  
JESSICA KORDA: Honestly, right now I have no idea.   
 Q.  Rest.  
JESSICA KORDA: Get healthy, rest, spend time with family.  We are going to go pick up our brother tonight at the airport, which we're really excited.  Haven't seen him in six weeks.   
Just spend some time together.
