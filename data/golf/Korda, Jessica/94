 Q.   First hole live?   
JESSICA KORDA:   What was that?   
   
 Q.   First one in a tournament when it counts?   
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   What club was it?   
JESSICA KORDA:   A baby cut 8â€‘iron.  
   
 Q.   Where was the hole at, back, front?   
JESSICA KORDA:   No, it was over a ridge, so it was on 8, just over the ridge like two feet on.  
   
 Q.   How many is that for you in your career?   
JESSICA KORDA:   Three, I had one when I was 8, one when I was 18, and the way I was going I thought the next one was going to be 28.
