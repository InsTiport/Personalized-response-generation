Q. We're here with Jessica Korda who just shot a third round 66 and takes a one-stroke lead into the final round of the Buick LPGA Shanghai. You had eight birdies today, including one on your final hole. Has to be a great feeling knowing you're playing so well heading into the final round.
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, you know, it was a great group to be in today. I think birdies were flying left and right, so it was really fun being able to stay in it and keep my head down and just keep plugging along.
Q. You were in such a groove today. Eight birdies; two bogeys. Were you feeling that way when you got up this morning? What was it in you?
JESSICA KORDA: No, absolutely not. I've been struggling a little bit with my swing so I've been working on it every day. It's slowly starting to kind of take its groove.
And then just making some putts. You know, my speed has been pretty decent and giving myself some opportunities, which is what I need out here.
Q. Heading into the final round you'll be in the same group tomorrow as you were today with Danielle and Brooke. You said so many birdies out there. Does that help you when you're out there seeing all that success going on around you?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it is awesome. Always put a lot of pressure on every putt. Every putt mattered. I mean, every putt always does matter, but it was kind of a little bit like a match play, so brought those Solheim Cup juices back. It was really fun. I really enjoyed today.
