 Q.  Best round of the day; what was different today than yesterday?  
JESSICA KORDA: I made putts.   
 Q.  No eights?  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, no bad shots.  It was a solid day.   
 Q.  One day late from the birthday, obviously that was a nice little redemption, I guess you could say.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it would have been nice to not shoot 3 over yesterday and end up pulling myself totally out of the tournament, but it's a good redemption around for sure.   
 Q.  What was your attitude going into today.  Obviously Sunday's going to be a big charge?  
JESSICA KORDA: I proved there was not going to be a charge big enough to catch that lead.  I was 11 shots out starting the day.  I just wanted to get myself in the top 10 and get a good feel for next week, that's really it.   
 Q.  I don't want to jinx her but I want to say it looks pretty locked up for Lexi.  How big is that for her to get an American win on the board for the year?  
JESSICA KORDA: It's the first one?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
JESSICA KORDA: Oh, that's great.  No, that's awesome.  This is a golf course that I think would suit a long hitter and she's always played well here.  I feel like this is her golf course every year, and I guess the putts were falling.
