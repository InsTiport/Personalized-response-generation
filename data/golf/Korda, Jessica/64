 Q.  Just your round overall today.  I know not the ending you'd want on the last hole, but...  
JESSICA KORDA: I think I played the hole as a par-5 honestly.  The greens are really firm so it's hard to get to a lot of holes.  I do not know how Kim shot 8-under out there today.  The pins were tucked today.  It was not easy.  It was almost impossible to give yourself an uphill putt on any of the holes really.   
So, yeah, it was a tough day out there, so I can't say -- I'm pretty satisfied with an under-par score.   
 Q.  Now you're one back and a lot of players bunched up.  Thoughts going into tomorrow?  
JESSICA KORDA: Try again tomorrow.  Really nothing I can do.  Just play my own game and see what happens.   
 Q.  Tough day, even tougher just not feeling that well?  
JESSICA KORDA: I mean, obviously I'm exhausted.  It's my fourth week out on the road.  I don't think I've done four weeks all year, especially postinjury, so obviously stamina is a little low.   
I think last night was the first night I slept through the night because of jet lag, too, so it's not the easiest coming over from Asia.
