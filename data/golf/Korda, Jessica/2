  Q. Jess, solid 3-under 69 to start the day.  You're T6 after day one.  Opened with three straight birdies.  Just take us through the start and the fire start you had.
 JESSICA KORDA:   Well, I pulled my tee shot way left.  Had a great angle into the green.  Hit two quite close and made that putt.
 And then didn't hit a great tee shot again on 2, but was able to put it in the fairway and wedge it and make a good putt.
 Made a nice kind of downhiller.  It was really touchy on 3.
 So it was really nice to start birdie, birdie, birdie.  Just didn't realize I was going to not see my next one until 18.
 Q. But you found it.
 JESSICA KORDA:   I did.
 Q. I would imagine the cloud cover was a welcome sight this afternoon in the desert.
 JESSICA KORDA:   It's hot and dry.  Like really, really dry.  This is not what a Florida girl loves.  (Laughter.)
 But I'm prepared.  I've played this so many years in a row now and I know what to expect.  But there's definitely been some eyedrops in the eyes couple times today.
 Q. You brother is making a run at the Miami Open.  Excited to go watch him tonight.  What's it been like to see him not only progress in his career, but turn in the performances he's been turning in?
 JESSICA KORDA:   It's been awesome.  He's been playing such great tennis and it's been really fun.  Nelly and I have been organizing our practice rounds around it, like I think we did last time for the French.
 But he's been playing really well and keeping such a level head and I'm so proud of him.  This is just the start, and I think that's the fun part.  You've seen where they've been and worked from as kids, and this is just the beginning.
