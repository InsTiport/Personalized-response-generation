 Q.  You've had a frustrating season in way.  You had the arm injury which forced you to withdraw from RICOH, not play in the Solheim; you've only blade in the Evian since then.  Today you were going pretty well through the first 11 holes or so.  Just sum up your round for us today.  
JESSICA KORDA: I was okay.  Nothing really special happened.  Definitely a little rusty still here and there, but I can see improvements, which is the biggest thing.   
Honestly, I'm just waiting for the year to be over so I can start fresh again.   
 Q.  Pretty cold starting out this morning.  A lot of players and caddies wearing gloves.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it's cold.  It's still cold.   
 Q.  How would you sum up your season?  You had a couple top 10s early on, but then with that forearm injury...  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, no, it was a really good season.  It was looking really nice and then got injured.  So just kind of scrapped this year and start again next year.   
 Q.  How many events are you looking to play in now to end the season?  
JESSICA KORDA: I am going to play five events.  Five events left, four after this one.  So basically just skipping next week and playing my way in.   
 Q.  Final question.  How do you like this course and how does it set up for your game?  
JESSICA KORDA: I haven't been able to figure this golf course out yet.  I don't know why.  Just the greens, I struggle on the greens a lot.  I just don't see the lines.  I hit exactly where I want to hit them, but they just don't seem to go in.   
Honestly, I am just trying to put one foot in front of the other.  I've been able to put one week of good practice in, which is the first time I've been able to practice since May.   
So, yeah, small steps.
