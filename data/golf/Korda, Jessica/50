Q. You've carried on your good form into this week?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it was good.  I had one bad hole but other than that, I just try to keep the ball in play.  I'm really tired.  My stamina is definitely a lot lower than I was expecting, but it's okay.  It's just hot.
Q. And also, we've obviously read about your operation.  I heard last week, that you couldn't keep smiling.
JESSICA KORDA: My cheeks actually do hurt still from it.  The muscles are still a little tired.
Q. Difficult when you win to stop smiling.
JESSICA KORDA: My friends are like, don't worry, don't win in Thailand -- and I go and win and they are just like, wow.
Q. How is it feeling this week?
JESSICA KORDA: I'm just honestly, I'm just tired.  You know, I feel fine.  I feel the same.
Q. Do you sleep okay with it?
JESSICA KORDA: I sleep perfectly now.  Before, I couldn't sleep on my sides.  I slept sitting up.  Now I can sleep however I please, which is really nice because the bones are starting to grow in and I still have some holes on the sides that the bones are growing in, and obviously it's still sore just kind of on the top here.
