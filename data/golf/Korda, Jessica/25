Q. You guys played a practice round together here?
JESSICA KORDA: She's obviously playing well today.
Q. What did you think about this course and her game and been matching up?  How did she play in the practice round?
JESSICA KORDA: Nelly plays well every week.  It doesn't matter.  No, she's been upset because she didn't place that great in the last couple of Majors.
She really was trying to apply herself more this week.  She plays well, as you know, every week in the Majors and kind struggled a little bit.  But she's been working really hard with David and has a low golf flight in general.  That's really helped her out here, especially keeping it under the wind.  Riding a lot of confidence right now.
Q. When you say apply herself, what does that mean?
JESSICA KORDA: For every person it's just different, a different mindset going in.  She's trying to take it like another event and you've heard bunch of top players say the same thing where it's just another event and you just try and hit the in the middle of the fairway and help yourself around the golf course.
Q. How have you seen her grow since she's been out here in terms of mentally, from the neck up?
JESSICA KORDA: A lot.  She's definitely less stressed, which is really good thing for her.  She's -- she has all the confidence in the world which is kind of the one thing she was missing a little bit at the beginning and always said her winning is not if, it's when.  So it's kind of the same thing right now.
Q. Her learning curve has been definitely a lot shorter than a lot of the players.  Why do you think that is?
JESSICA KORDA: Because she's been out here as long as I have.  She did get a head start.
