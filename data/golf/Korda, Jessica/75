Q. You've got to feel pretty good about the way it ended?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, really good.  It's really cold outside, so it's going to be interesting to see what happens this afternoon.
Q. What do you like about this golf course so much?  Second last year, in contention again this week.
JESSICA KORDA: I just like the way it sets up for my game.  Practicing in Florida I think all off-season has really prepared me for a golf course like this because it's very similar, and I just like driving to a tournament.
Q. You're Florida all year-round; how do you deal with this cold?
JESSICA KORDA: Hand warmers, lots of clothes.
Q. What are you going to do for the next five hours?
JESSICA KORDA: Sleep.
