Q. Maybe got out at just the right time.
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, definitely.  Been really, really nice this morning.  I think we got away with a lot.  (Laughter.)
Q. How did you feel out there?
JESSICA KORDA: I felt good.  Stuck to my process.  Working on a couple things before the U.S. Open, so just stuck to that and it worked.
Q. Obviously there is a lot of golf left to play, even today.
JESSICA KORDA: Oh, yeah.
Q. But you've got to like your position after the first round.
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah.  I mean, you knew that if the wind wasn't blowing and the greens were soft you could be really aggressive.  I just needed some birdies to drop, and that's exactly what happened.
I'm just happy that I finished the round.  We'll just have to wait and see what happens now.
Q. Especially with weather like this, is it a better advantage to go early in the morning, just get the round out of the way, especially the one you had today?
JESSICA KORDA: Just depends.  If it was raining this morning and nice this afternoon, probably not.  I would rather been in the afternoon.  Just depends on when the weather is coming in.
Hopefully it holds off for them.  This is still a light drizzle so not too bad.  Once the heavy stuff comes down, I'm not 100% sure how much more the golf course can take.
Q. As far as finishing holes go, especially since you birdied them today, what do you think about this one?
JESSICA KORDA: Oh, it's tough.  It's a very challenging hole off the tee; you're trying to get it into the fairway into a good position.  Depending on where the pin is, you try to be aggressive or just put yourself in a good position.
Obviously par is always the goal, and anything else is just a bonus.
Q. Can you sort of take us through what you did on 18?
JESSICA KORDA: Oh, I just pumped a drive down the center.  Had like 112 yards and hit a little 54 in there and made a whatever, a 4-, 5-footer for birdie.
Q. What have you been working on the last two weeks?
JESSICA KORDA: Just my transition hasn't been great.  A lot of people have asked me why I was hitting it so short in San Fran, and I was just trying to hit it into the fairway because I just wasn't feeling great over the ball.
So just trying to tighten up some things before the U.S. Open comes around.  Hopefully just keeps going the way that it is.
Q. Did it feel okay today?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah.  Obviously I think I hit one really bad drive.  I was fine, but like for me, I didn't do what I was supposed to do.
So that's a little frustrating, but it's a lot of thinking and a lot of committing to the shot.  So that's why my coach was like, Well, you have two weeks to figure it out.  I was like, Gee, thanks.
So, yeah.
