 Q.  You're finally here for one of her wins. She kind of made it stressful on you there at the end.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, she was like, I was there for your win and now you're here for mine. I was like, yeah, I had a lead; you decided to make me sit through a playoff.   
 Q.  Describe the emotions on the other side for you?  
JESSICA KORDA: I felt bad for her when she made all those mistakes coming in, but every time she tried to look at me, I would try to tell her, it's going to be okay. Seeing her walk off 18 in regulation, I saw she had fire in her eyes -- I just felt really good about it and I was just praying that it was going to work out.   
At the end of the day, a playoff, it's totally out of your hands. She piped it down the fairway and hit such a good shot in. I did give her a little bit of crap for leaving it short, as you should. But yeah, so awesome to be here.   
 Q.  And how proud are you after three wins, and she's still so young?  
JESSICA KORDA: She is. She's 21 years old. She'll be out here for a lot of years hopefully and we've got a lot more of this coming.
