Q. Fantastic performance. Can you sum up the emotions, securing that point for Team USA?
JESSICA KORDA: It's big. Looking at the leaderboard, we need all the points we can get. Team Europe's playing great golf. Carol was a really tough match. She came out bombing -- not only her drives but those putts coming in were insane.
Q. Big celebration with your sister coming off the green there. You featured in many Solheim Cups, but first one with her. How special has that been for you this week?
JESSICA KORDA: It's great. This has been the greatest experience I've had, and I'm excited for many more to come.
Q. Everything is so close. What was the key today?
JESSICA KORDA: It was a tough match against Carol. She was playing so well early on. And I wasn't hitting the shots that I wanted to. I felt like I was hitting them well. They just weren't going in my favor until I just tried to stay patient and just keep putting the pressure on and keep trying to hit good shots. And it started to slowly pay off.
Q. How would you rate your whole weekend? It was fantastic. You stayed unbeatable.
JESSICA KORDA: You know, obviously, we don't know what's going to happen here. But my job was to put points down on the board and that's exactly what I did. So hopefully it's enough.
Q. Not only you, but your sister as well. What a great performance by a rookie.
JESSICA KORDA: It's great. I saw she was down early, and then coming back and winning, it's great.
