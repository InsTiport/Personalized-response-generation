 Q.  You're one of the highest ball hitters, one of the longest ball hitters on Tour.  How much did that height and length help you off the tee today?  
JESSICA KORDA: Oh, it was great.  Finally a golf course that benefits the long hitters.  The last couple weeks it's definitely been a lot of 3-woods or even 4-irons off the tees, so this is really, really nice.   
 Q.  You led the LPGA Tour in putting most of the season.  It kind of fell off just a little bit, but you seem to have regained your form.  What have you done to get that back?  
JESSICA KORDA: Honestly, just the same thing.  It's golf.  I've been rolling it really well, and they've been hitting the lips and just not going in, so just continuing on the same path that I have been, and sometimes they fall and sometimes they don't.  That's the beauty of golf.   
 Q.  Summarize your day for us.  
JESSICA KORDA: Good.  You know, it was wet out there, so managing each shot was tough and trying to take some spin off of some wedges that I had coming in.  But I love the way that they set up the golf course.  I could finally hit drivers and had kind of mid-irons to shorter irons in.  It wasn't a wedge on every hole and an iron or a 3-wood off of every tee.  I love the way that they set up the golf course.  So yeah, I had a good time.   
 Q.  Basically making it longer?  
JESSICA KORDA: Actually this is how golf courses should be set up for us.  I like a -- it's not even longer, it's just -- I had 8-irons into greens instead of having 60 or having to hit a rescue off of the tee just to get to an 8-iron off the fairway.   
 Q.  Of the longest courses you guys play out here, how did this rank in terms of (indiscernible)?  
JESSICA KORDA: You know, because we've had such bad weather this year, it's so tough to tell because we've been in a rain drought for the last like six or seven events, so obviously they had to make it shorter just because nobody was getting any roll.  This ranks as a major.  This is a major, and it played like a major golf course.   
 Q.  Was it a course that suited your eye the first time you saw it, where you felt like this was good for your game?  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, I mean, I liked it.  You never know how they're going to set it up.  You're always just playing from the back of the tee, as long as it gets, and then kind of from there you make decisions based upon that.  But it is, it's a beautiful golf course.  KPMG and PGA of America always put us at beautiful golf courses, so this is no different.   
 Q.  You've talked in the past about this being the next step, winning a major.  What is sort of your takeaway from maybe not the Women's Open but the ANA and getting closer to that goal?  
JESSICA KORDA: You know, I've been hitting the ball really well, and it hasn't been basically online.  It's just about them going in the hole.  I haven't had that the last couple of weeks.  I've kind of just been burning every edge.  So I'm just trying to stay patient.  Every week is different.  I'm hoping no weather delays.  But yeah, it's kind of just one day at a time.   
 Q.  How do you feel?  
JESSICA KORDA: I feel okay, yeah.   
 Q.  Would you like to see more courses set up this way?  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Just sort of to allow more separation?  
JESSICA KORDA: Just so we can play the same game that everybody else is.  A lot of it is set up to where we're landing it in the area where it's getting tight, and so it takes driver out of play for us.  We do see it a lot where we're not hitting driver as much as everybody else is.
