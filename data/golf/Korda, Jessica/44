 Q.  Jessica Korda on Sunday morning.  Just finished four holes; 8-under heading into the final round.  How are you feeling?  You're finally done with round two.  
JESSICA KORDA: It's weird to be done with round two on a Sunday morning.  You know, just got to stay patient.  The golf course is definitely wet.  It's really well.  But the greens are fantastic.   
I have no idea how they pulled through and got it playable for how much rain we've gotten this last week.  So huge props to the groundscrew.  All the volunteers, everyone involved has done an amazing job.  We're very thankful everyone stuck around and didn't leave us.   
 Q.  I know everybody is kind of in the same boat.  How do you sort of deal with yesterday, no golf?  What do you do to pass the time?  
JESSICA KORDA: Food, Netflix, sleep.  That's my checklist.   
 Q.  How will you get ready now for the final round?  
JESSICA KORDA: Probably just -- I don't even know what time we may be teeing off.  I have no idea.  I'm going to go figure that out right now.   
I'm mostly likely just going to go back, relax for a little bit, come back, get a second warmup of the day, and go out.   
 Q.  Lastly, just assess your game heading into the last round.  You have a chance to have a really good result.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, no, definitely.  I would've liked some putts to drop.  Definitely left a lot on the edges there.  (Wind interference.)...give or take, longer putts.   
Good position going into this afternoon or later on in the morning.  (Laughter.)   
But, yeah, just really excited.
