Q. You were just one of a few people under par today.  How was the course playing for you?
JESSICA KORDA: Ridiculously hard.  I mean, the pins weren't as tough as yesterday, but the wind really, really picked up, and it's really firm.  So it's hard to stop the ball on the greens in the right spots, and just a lot of the holes are playing really long.
I just was able to somewhat minimize my mistakes and just be able to keep the ball in play.
Q. How does this compare, playing this year compared to playing last year where you were the runner-up?
JESSICA KORDA: I think this year was definitely a lot harder.  Like I said, it's just windier and the greens are firmer, and so it's harder to kind of get close.  If you miss a green, this rough is really, really hard.  Every time it comes out differently.  There's no way of gauging how it's going to come out.
Q. What's your approach going to be, knowing the wind will probably be a factor for tomorrow's round?
JESSICA KORDA: Well, considering there's a typhoon coming our way, I don't think it's going to be any calmer.
So basically just the same thing.  Hopefully doesn't feel like we're out there for eight hours, because it was a long round today.
