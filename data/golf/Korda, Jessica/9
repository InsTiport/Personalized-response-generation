Q. Great play today.
JESSICA KORDA: Thank you.
Q. How does it feel just to be going into this spot, in this spot going into Sunday?
JESSICA KORDA: It's good. It's obviously what I play for. Would've loved more putts to drop, but just not meant to be I guess today. Good to be able to keep myself in it, and thankful for those three birdies in a row to really get myself into it.
Q. You've played well on the back nine, and the front nine obviously seems like the tougher nine for everybody. How crucial is that going to be tomorrow to get off to a quick start?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, hopefully no mud balls tomorrow. I had a couple today and hit it into the hazard on 1 and was able to make an up and down from almost 100 yards.
A little unlucky there, but pretty good. Pretty happy about it. We're going to try and do the same thing tomorrow and just be patient. A lot golf. These holes coming in, they're not easy.
Q. Being a Florida native, it always seems like you, your sister, upper Florida natives are always up near top of the leaderboard at this event. Just knowing the grass, how critical is that?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it is. It's great. I mean, growing up on basically similar golf courses. I play at the Bear's Club and it's very similar layout.
So, yeah, very comfortable out here. Just always happy to be able to come back.
Q. Highest purse obviously in women's golf history tomorrow up for grabs. Is there more nerves in your part or...
JESSICA KORDA: I'm just trying win a golf tournament. What comes with that is obviously a huge positive, but right now I'm concentrating on trying to win a golf tournament.
