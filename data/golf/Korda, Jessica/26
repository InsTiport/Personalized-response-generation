 Q.  Girls, congratulations. A great performance. Seriously consistent golf out there. Jessica, how great does it feel to get some red on the board first of all?  
JESSICA KORDA: It's great. We've got a couple matches that are really close, so it's going to be interesting to see what happens in the next couple of, I guess, hours. So, yeah, really excited.   
 Q.  Nelly, as the rookie on the team, how much did you enjoy playing with your sister out there on the golf course?  
NELLY KORDA: It was a lot of fun. I think the whole group had a lot of fun. Our caddies are really good friends, too. So it was really light out there.   
 Q.  Early on, you told Juli you were keen to be paired together. There's certainly no doubt in anyone's mind you're a great pairing. Jess, do you feel like you're more confident because your sister's right there; you've got that understanding?  
JESSICA KORDA: Oh, yeah, absolutely. It doesn't matter, if I hit a bad shot she's, like, it's fine; I got this. The same thing, if she hits a bad shot, it's fine; I've got this. There's no disappointment either way. I think that's just really comforting, especially in this format.   
 Q.  The very first points on the board, the sister duo. A history-making performance by being together as sisters for the first time in the Solheim Cup and a winning combination. What did it mean to be both out there together and get this win?  
JESSICA KORDA: It was awesome. We had fun already starting on the driving range actually, so it was really, relaxed, and just had a great time, obviously playing together is just a tip of the top --   
 Q.  Nelly, you said yesterday in your press conference you all started talking about this for the first time when Jess first played in the Solheim Cup. That was six years ago, 2013. How long and how excited have you been for this moment?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, I've been really excited. Ever since Colorado, that was the goal that I set in my mind, I think both of us. But finally leading up to this moment on the first tee it was so fun. And we had such a good day, and really lighthearted, and it was a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Nelly, seeing this is your first Solheim Cup, how special it was to get those points on the board as sisters?  
NELLY KORDA: It was definitely a lot of fun today. We started out quite hot. I think we won the first birdie, birdie. So it was a good start. And I don't think we could have dreamt of anything better.   
 Q.  Jessica, can you explain what the difference is like playing with your sister and scoring points straight off the bat?  
JESSICA KORDA: It's awesome. I was definitely a lot more calm than I was the last Solheim Cup. So I think that helped me as well. Just joking around with her all day. There's nothing I can say wrong. I know where her buttons are, so I know where not to step, and vice versa; and I was very comfortable with myself and just being out there with her.   
 Q.  Everyone's saying because you played so brilliantly together today, perhaps you could share the love around. But I'm guessing the way you played you want to stick together?  
JESSICA KORDA: Depends. This is all on Captain Juli, and we're just her forces trying to put points up on the board.   
 Q.  Would you prefer to stay together?  
NELLY KORDA: It doesn't really matter. If we play together, great, but we get along with everybody on the team so we're happy with whatever.   
 Q.  Everybody hopes for a good start, but what was that, was it a perfect start?  
JESSICA KORDA: It was a great start. It was -- hitting it in the middle of the fairway and then Nelly hitting in close, and then just making that putt, even though they were in trouble, yeah, that was a dream start.   
 Q.  Nelly, first one, you didn't seem to be nervous at all. How much fun was it out there?  
NELLY KORDA: It was a lot of fun. And when you have your sister by your side she kind of calms you down a little. So you have someone to lean on.   
 Q.  How much of a boost can it give to your teammates to get that first point now?  
JESSICA KORDA: Looking up on that board, knowing that there's red out there, I think, is really comforting and motivating. And there's a lot of matches that are really close. We'll see what happens. It's the first day. There's still a lot of golf to be played.   
 Q.  Probably a good sign to stay together for the next day?  
NELLY KORDA: We'll see.   
JESSICA KORDA: We'll see, yeah.
