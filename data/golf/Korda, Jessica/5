  Q. Jessica, happy birthday.  How does it feel after your birthday that you're still in contention?
 JESSICA KORDA:   I'm in contention?  Feels fine.  We'll see what it looks like at the end of the day.
 Q. What are what are birthday plans?
 JESSICA KORDA:   Nothing.  We're at tournament.  We can't do anything.
 Q. Did you wake up to a lot of happy text messages and such?
 JESSICA KORDA:   I did, I did.  I have some really great friends.  My cousin called me as soon as my alarm clock went off because I responded to her message.  She was like, I've been waiting.  I wanted to catch you before your round.  I am going to go call my grandparents here after.
 Q. Last time you won it was your dad's birthday.  How cool would it be to win this week and it be your birthday?
 JESSICA KORDA:   It would be really nice.  I unfortunately bogeyed the last hole, which sucks, but my sister is in contention at the top, so a win for her would be a win for me as well.  I'll definitely be chasing tomorrow.
