  JESSICA KORDA:   Had a couple of disagreements here and there, and I wasn't in the right state of mind and I just was more consumed on what was going on just not my way.   And I knew I needed to switch and just have a little bit more fun out there.   It's a U.S. Open.   It's tough out there.   It just wasn't working out.   That's all I'm going to say to that.  
   
 Q.   When did it start?  
JESSICA KORDA:   It's common out here.   It's nothing new.   It just the way that it played out that I did it after the 9th hole.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever done that before?  
JESSICA KORDA:   Have I done that before?   No.  
   
 Q.   How do you switch gears and focus on what you are doing after that?  
JESSICA KORDA:   The first few holes I was very shaky, but my boyfriend/caddie kept me very calm out there and kept it very light.   And it was kind of funny seeing him fumble over yardage.   Like I said, it just kept it very light out there.  
   
 Q.   Just to make sure that we have got it right, you told him‑‑ he didn't quit.   You told him that‑‑  
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Has your boyfriend ever carried your bag before?  
JESSICA KORDA:   No.   I've always said that I don't want him to caddie for me.  
   
 Q.   He's a player, right?   
JESSICA KORDA:   He is a player, so that helps a lot.  
   
 Q.   What was that conversation like when you said, hey, you are on?   
JESSICA KORDA:   It was tough for me, because I care about Jason a lot.   He is a great guy.   That's just how it happens sometimes in life.   That was one of those things todaythat it just unfolded.   
It was very hard for me to do.   I'm not that type of person to take these things really easily.   For me it was very hard to tell him that and it took a lot for me.  
   
 Q.   How about the conversation to tell your boyfriend you're on?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I just told him, Johnny, grab the bag, let's go.  
   
 Q.   Who grabs it tomorrow?  
JESSICA KORDA:   He does.  
   
 Q.   He will?   Were there problems going into this event between you and Jason?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I mean, I think everybody has problems every week.   You blame the caddie, the caddie blames you.   It's just up in the air.   I just felt like enough was enough today so I just‑‑ I just wasn't mentally ready for it.  
It's a U.S. Open.   It's a big week for me.   It's one of the most important weeks for me of the year.   I was just not in the right state of mind.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever seen another player do that?  
JESSICA KORDA:   No.  
   
 Q.   When did it occur to you that this was an option?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I've heard about it the, stories.   But, like I said, I just wasn't in the right state of mind.   
With the wind and with the way the course was playing today, I needed to be positive out there and just didn't happen.  
   
 Q.   Is this just for this event?  
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Then you guys‑‑  
JESSICA KORDA:   He has his own golfing career.   He's not going to caddie for me.  
   
 Q.   In terms of Jason as‑‑  
JESSICA KORDA:   I'm not sure yet.  
   
 Q.   You are not sure?   Other than that, how was your day?   
JESSICA KORDA:   Were you guys planning on asking me any other questions?  
   
 Q.   You played well on the back nine?   
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   What was different other than the guy on the bag?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I was having more fun.   I was a bit more relaxed.   
The pins today, the golf course is not playing easy at all.   The pins are interesting.   They are three yards from the water and four yards from the bunker, and then you have got the wind and the gusts.   It's a frustrating day out there.   So it was really important to just keep calm and have fun with it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
JESSICA KORDA:   Definitely.   I think in terms of pins, they pushed some tees back so they played it a lot longer.   The course is in great shape.   It definitely felt like a hard U.S. Open today.  
   
 Q.   Had Jason been on your bag for a year, is that right?   
JESSICA KORDA:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Any chance your sister will let her caddie go?  
JESSICA KORDA:   No, I wouldn't even let that happen, no.   
   
 Q.   Is that your dad?  
JESSICA KORDA:   That's my dad, yeah.   They work really well together.   Just going to keep it there.  
   
 Q.   The final day tomorrow, obviously it's an emotional day.   What are your goals coming out tomorrow?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I don't know.   I haven't thought that far honestly.   Glad today is over and see what happens.   Talk to my family and just enjoy the evening, wait for tee times to come out.
