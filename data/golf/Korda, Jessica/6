  Q. Jessica, how do you feel about your second round today at Lake Nona?
 JESSICA KORDA:   Happy with an under par score.  A little frustrated that I left a lot out there.
 But still two days left.
 Q. How rested do you feel after Diamond?
 JESSICA KORDA:   Rusted or rested?
 Q. Rested.
 JESSICA KORDA:   Sure.  You know, it's weird just getting ready for one event and then taking time off again and then getting ready for another event.  You almost forget that that one event happened.
 Yeah, no, happy to be back out.  What a great place to be able to play.  The hospitality and the golf course is just incredible.
 Q. There were so many things to celebrate that week at Diamond, including your father's birthday.  Were you able to celebrate your win at all?
 JESSICA KORDA:   I was.  I was a bit tired the week after, but I definitely did some celebrating for sure.
 Q. Anything that you are particularly focusing on or hope to get out of the weekend?
 JESSICA KORDA:   Hopefully I make more putts and read the greens a bit better.  Other than that, I'm happy.
