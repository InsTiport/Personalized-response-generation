Q. Here with Jessica Korda who just shot a first round 68. You looked pretty steady out there. Bunch of birdies out there; just two bogeys. You've got to feel pretty good coming off the golf course right now.
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, definitely. I haven't played since Solheim Cup, so a little rusty with a couple shots. I'm going to go to the driving range and try to figure that out a little bit.
But, yeah, I was really proud of myself today. Speed of the greens was changing a lot. Definitely got a lot faster at the end, but I was able to keep it together.
Q. What is that challenge of seeing a golf course that starts off one way and changes over a series of 18 holes? How do you keep your mind wrapped around that?
JESSICA KORDA: I mean, we kind of just saw it during the practice round, which luckily I showed up on Sunday and was able to play Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Just keeping the same routines and having to remember it after so long.
Q. You got to feel good though. You said pretty rusty coming back, feeling well. How do you prepare now for tomorrow? You said you're going straight to the range.
JESSICA KORDA: Going to the range now, going to go back, have some dinner, chill for a little bit, wait for tee times to come out, and do it all over again.
