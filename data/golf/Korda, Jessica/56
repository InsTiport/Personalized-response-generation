Q. Got to be a good feeling.  Long break, and come back out and have a great round right off the bat.  How do you feel coming off the golf course?
JESSICA KORDA: It's nice.  It's really, really nice.  Definitely a lot of rest, but it's just nice to be out there and be able to hit the shots again.
I had a strong finish last year, and just kind of cap that off and then start today it's pretty nice.  Started with an eagle, too, and I was like, Damn.
Q. Did you have in any expectations coming into today?
JESSICA KORDA: No.  Like I was like, all right, I can't pick up my ball, I can't put my club down in the sand, I can't above my lie.
Q. So literally you can't bend over to do things yet?
JESSICA KORDA: No, no, no.  I mean like when you're at home and you're just practicing, playing, wedges, whatever.  I'm like, looking at my score after every hole.
Q. Back to the job part.
JESSICA KORDA: Exactly.  Yeah, it's just playing again.
Q. I'm asking this to everyone because it's going to be here all week, how do you deal with this weather?
JESSICA KORDA: It's hot.  Lots of liquids and try and stay in the shade as much as you can.
