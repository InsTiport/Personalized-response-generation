Q.   You had it to three.   Was it up an down in terms of bogeys and birdies today? 
JESSICA KORDA:     Yeah, started with a birdie and then quickly dropped on my third hole, and then made a couple of birdies coming in.   Just up‑and‑down all day. 
It's a U.S. Open; it's to be expected.   Just got to stay patient out there. 

Q.   The way the tees were moved up, did that cause you any difficulty at all?
JESSICA KORDA:   Not really.   You just play the yardage that you have.   You've played the golf course.   It's not that really that big of a deal.   It's just another couple of yards here and there.

Q.   Were the bogeys the result of bad approach shots?
JESSICA KORDA:   There was one 3‑putt and then one bad approach shot, and the rest were just I tuggedit into the rough off the tee and you have to take your medicine out of there.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
JESSICA KORDA:   Probably‑‑ I didn't really leave too many out there on the front nine, more on the back nine.   Probably around like four more or five more birdies I could have had.

Q.   You are still a young player (inaudible)?
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, I mean, I have been playing solid all year, just a couple of small injuries here and there. 
But nothing was going to keep me from playing in the U.S. Open.   It's one of my favorite events.   It's my sixth time playing it.   I wouldn't miss this for the world.   This is one of my favorite ones.   Shoot 2‑under, great, but you have got three more days left.

Q.   Why it your favorite?
JESSICA KORDA:   When I was 15, I qualified for the U.S. Open, and I realized that this was what I wanted to do.   Just the atmosphere of the U.S. Open, it's nothing like anything you play.
