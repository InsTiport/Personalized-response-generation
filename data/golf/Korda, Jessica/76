Q. The state of your game and how you feel about where you are right now?
JESSICA KORDA: David Whelan and I have been working really hard this off-season.  I'm kind of getting back to my old swing and getting back to my fundamentals and making everything really simple, so I'm just trying to put in the work.  On the golf course, it still feels a little off on the course, feels a little better on the range.  Just got to keep working on it.
Q. When did you start with David?
JESSICA KORDA: A week before the British last year.
Q. What's the test been like, the weather, the suspension of play?
JESSICA KORDA: It's just hard to time out your day.  I think we came back out and played two and a half holes this morning and then had most of the afternoon/morning off and then back to play six holes, so I think just timing it all and keeping your energy levels up has been a little bit of a challenge.
Q. Do you feel like your game is in a spot where you can win?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, absolutely.  Going into Malaysia I didn't think it was, and it happened there, so I don't see why not this week.
