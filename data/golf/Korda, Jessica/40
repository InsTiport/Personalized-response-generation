 Q.  So you took advantage of some pretty good scoring conditions it looks like this morning.  
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, you know, it was definitely pretty good out there this morning.  Just trying to keep it in the fairways.  Got a lot of wedges in my hand and so was being really aggressive with it.   
As the day went on the greens got a lot faster.  I was not expecting that.  I started having six-footers coming back for par.  That's kind of where all my bogeys came from today, was just on the green and a little bit of inconsistency that some greens are firm and some aren't.   
But that's to be expected starting in the morning.  Definitely afternoon will be firm and fast.   
 Q.  You can feel the wind a little bit now and then yesterday.  Can you sense how the course will change if the wind picks up?  
JESSICA KORDA: I played it yesterday when it was windy yesterday afternoon and it's playing like the British.  You're definitely trying to land it short of the green and run it up.   
We'll see.  All depends how they set up the golf course.   
 Q.  How drastically does it change the mindset of attacking this course if the wind picks up tomorrow afternoon?  
JESSICA KORDA: Again, depends how they set up the golf course.  All of a sudden you'll be hitting longer irons in; won't be as aggressive; try and put yourself in the best position possible.   
 Q.  How important was it to go low with a non-windy day just in case the rest of the week...  
JESSICA KORDA: We talked about that actually the 10th hole, which was our 1st hole.  Looked at the weather sheet and were like, Oh, better go low today.  Who knows if we're even going to be able to play.  Honestly, I think -- the greens are fast, and if it starts pumping the way they say that it is, I don't know even if it's going to be playable.
