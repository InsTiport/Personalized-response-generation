Q. How are you feeling today after saying yesterday you were feeling exhausted; yet you managed another great round today.
JESSICA KORDA: A little less tired but still tired.  Would love a round with no doubles.  I'm 6-over on certain holes, which kind of sucks looking at the leaderboard.  But at the same time, I'm thankful for where I am with how I'm feeling.
Q. What happened there?  Did you catch a bit of grass?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it caught grass and then my wrist popped out of place and then my -- just, yeah, and I got it to pop back in, but it hurt in the meantime.  And then I iced it and took an Advil and hoped for it to go down and it did.  I'm very happy.  That's what happens when you're double-jointed and hypermobile.
Q. So you can pop it back in and play on?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah.
Q. So you'll have to ice it tonight?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, I'll ice it as soon as I get done right now.
