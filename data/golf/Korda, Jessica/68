Q. For all the fans that were watching today's round, if you could give a sense of what the course conditions were like?  I know the greens and pins were really challenging.  What's your overall sense of the course today?
JESSICA KORDA: It played like a totally different golf course.  It wasn't the same as every day.  The golf course conditions were a lot harder today.  Some greens were slow and there were some greens that were fast.
But all in all, like you know, it was a tough day out there.  Obviously the scoring I don't think was as low as it has been the past couple days.
Q. What are your goals for the rest of the year?
JESSICA KORDA: I have three events left.  I'm going to go back and rest right now.  Next week is another hot week and then I have Japan and CME.  So I would say that, you know, looking back at this week, I think considering we had zero preparation for the tournament and came in on Wednesday, I think I would have taken a second place if you would have told me that that's what I would have gotten.
Q. Did you get any practice rounds?
JESSICA KORDA: No.  We drove the golf course, but we got done at 6:30.  Yeah, we didn't get a lot of preparation.
But you know what, with the typhoon, there's nothing you can do.  Everybody out here kind of had the same thing.  But like I said, if somebody was going to tell me at the beginning of the week that you were going to be second, I would have been like, all right, that's cool.
