Q.   How was it out there today? 
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, definitely a lot better.   If I can get those first two holes down, then I don't have to be 6‑over par on them in two days it would be nice.   But came back nicely and had a lot of opportunities on the back nine and just couldn't get it rolling on line so it was a little tough. 

Q.   You're not the only one who has found the first two holes difficult.   Yesterday I think was 4.8 on the first hole?
JESSICA KORDA:   I left so many shots out there.   But it was a really good round.   This golf course is playing super tough.   Every day I feel like we have completely different weather and the golf course is playing not the same.   So every day is a new challenge. 

Q.   And is it a much different challenge from what you're used to in the States? 
JESSICA KORDA:   It's links golf.   I'm here with a sleeveless shirt on and I didn't think that was going to happen at all.   It's great weather that we're having, and the golf course is in great shape.   Definitely one of my favorite links golf courses that we've played.

Q.   How did you double the first?
JESSICA KORDA:   Today or yesterday? 

Q.   Both days. 
JESSICA KORDA:   Yesterday I hit it right and then I had a really crappy lie.   Then I hit it left and then I hit it over‑‑ no, then I hit it short and then I hit it over and 2‑putted.
Today I hit it in the middle of the fairway, hit it right.   I was egged in bunker.   I was over the green and 2‑putt.   Sometimes when you get a bad lie out here, you've just got to take it.   It is what it is.   Everybody's going to have it. 

Q.   This year has been sort of a feast or famine year for you.   Can you talk about the roller coaster? 
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, it's definitely not as consistent as I was last year.   A lot going on behind the scenes and a lot of changes, so I'm still starting to get used to them.   I'm just trying to be more consistent.   My goal was to win and I did that twice already.   You know, I'm trying to get Top 10s but now I kind of want to get back into that mind‑set of I want to win but I still want to be consistent. 

Q.   Behind the scenes, you're talking about your swing changes?
JESSICA KORDA:   Just swing changes and in general.   I'm 21 years old and not a kid anymore, so just in general, changes, life, just so difficult sometimes.
