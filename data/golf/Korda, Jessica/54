Q. Here with Jessica Korda, who will go into tomorrow's as round with a four-stroke lead.  54-hole scoring record.  How did you feel right now?  You seem to be playing really well.?
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, it's great.  I'm really hot right now.  Today is definitely the hotter of the days we've had.  Ready to be back and kind of relax.
We had a little rain delay, which was not what we were expecting.  Just go back, relax, get some room service, and start again tomorrow.
Q. It was a quiet start for you.  Bogey on the front nine, so made the turn at 1-over, but then five birdies on the back nine.  Did you got a little fire there?  What happened to your game?
JESSICA KORDA: Honestly, I'm nervous.  I haven't been in this position in a couple months.  I knew was playing really well at the end of the season, but I haven't been in this position.  Being back, it just takes you a little bit of time.  I was hitting okay shots and just the putts weren't falling.
Then one fell and kind of started to open the door a little bit.  I think that's just what I got to keep doing, is not trying so hard and let it come to me.
Q. Were you watching leaderboards at all while you were out there?  You and Nelly as well both had great days.
JESSICA KORDA: Yeah, all the time.  I'm definitely a leaderboard watcher.  I love seeing her name up there.  I think that also lights a fire under my butt a little bit as well.
Q. Well you're sleeping on a 54-hole lead, final group tomorrow.  How do you prepare for the last day?
JESSICA KORDA: Same like every other day:  room service, relax, and actually pack tonight.  That's the only change that's going to be.
