  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome in our co-leader, Jessica Korda, into the interview room.   Jessica, wonderful day today again.   Didn't look like it started off really good, a little double for you.   How did you regroup, and then obviously finish strong and played really well throughout.  
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, I got a little frazzled there as I was walking to the first tee box and then obviously didn't hit a good shot, and I just‑‑ I tried to forget about it, tried to bring back, you know, it's okay and just think about what's ahead and not what just happened.  
   
 Q.   Now, I know we were dealing with some delays and trying to keep your mind and everything.   Did you do anything special during the delay?   A lot of eating and sitting I'm sure.   What else did you do to pass the time because there was quite some time to pass.   
JESSICA KORDA:   Well, yesterday I had breakfast twice and then we came out here and they were like oh, we're going to come back at like 2:30.   We knew that there was no way just by what we saw.   So I went already back to the room.  
I think I was ahead of the whole field already in bed and in my pajamas, so really didn't do much yesterday.   Got some treatments and ate a lot of food, and then this morning, you know, just ate and sat and ate some more, sat some more.   So there's really not much you can do.  
   
 Q.   A lot of patience.   
JESSICA KORDA:   A lot of patience.  
   
 Q.   When it was cut to 54 holes when you heard the announcement, does that change the mindset knowing that you only have really two rounds left and you're holding the lead and now only one round left, a little more urgency?  
JESSICA KORDA:   I mean yes and no.   It's tough with the rain.   We still don't know what it's going to look like tomorrow.   Today it was supposed to be 90 percent chance and yesterday it was like 60 or 70.   So every day is completely different, and we're just trying to play.   
I don't think the mindset is very different.   I think the girls are going to be making birdies regardless, and so you just gotta limit the mistakes and keep up with them.  
   
 Q.   And thoughts on the course conditions?   Everybody considerably says that they're insanely good considering how much rain they've gotten.   What were your thoughts?  
JESSICA KORDA:   We had about a 25‑minute wait on one of the tee boxes, and I sat down, and my butt was not wet.   So if that gives you any inclination of what it looks like out there, it's amazing conditions.   The golf course is draining incredibly well for how much rain we got.  
You know, the bunkers are obviously a little wet, but other than that, it's amazing how well it's responded to how much dumping it's gotten.   
   
 Q.   Now, the shot on 16 was pretty amazing, out of the rough to about two feet you say.   
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Was that a defining moment you think in this round because that was quite a recovery.   
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah, I mean I had a good lie and definitely didn't expect to be that close, but I hit a really good shot.   I wouldn't say that that was a defining moment.   I would say the putt on 18 that I made to save par was definitely good to bring the momentum that I had on the last 17 holes, to bring it in for tomorrow.   So hopefully I can just feed off of that.  
   
 Q.   And the putt, how long was the putt on 18?  
JESSICA KORDA:   It was like 17 feet, to be exact, on the dot now, I know you said you've been battling some injuries.  
   
 Q.   It's been a crazy year, but you're in position to get win No. 3, which would be a pretty solid year.   How would that define if you got the third win in 2014 what that would define this year as?  
JESSICA KORDA:   Obviously my goal this year is to win as many tournaments as I could, and I'm incredibly grateful and pleased with the two that I have had, and we'll see what happens tomorrow.   
There's still a lot of golf ahead.   Whatever the weather does, also we have to wait for that, and it's going to take a lot of patience, but I think the fact that I've been in this position more than once this year is a good sign paragraph.  
   
 Q.   Double bogey.   
JESSICA KORDA:   Yeah.   That's what happened.  
   
 Q.   Bad tee shot?  
JESSICA KORDA:   Bad tee shot.   I was under the tree.   I had to chip out, and then the ball wasn't flying as far today, so I didn't pick the right club, and then I three‑putted the green.   They were much slower than I was expecting them to be.   So just a lot of things thrown at me on the first hole that just threw me off a little bit.  
THE MODERATOR:   And last question.   She has to get out and practice before it gets dark.   
   
 Q.   We were told that you decided to change your swing coach who is also the coach of Michelle Wie.   So why did you make this decision?  
JESSICA KORDA:   David actually lives about 15 minutes away from my house.   I have gone to his academy since I was five years old, and that's where I started playing golf.   Hally, his daughter is my age.   We grew up together.   So David seemed like a very easy thing to transition into.   
I also was looking for a coach that was more experienced and has been in positions to where he's taken the player's game to a different level.   And so just picking his brain and being around him, and he's got great players.   He's got Jody Ewart Shadoff.   He's got Lydia, and he's got Michelle.   Am I missing somebody?   
THE MODERATOR:   Probably a few.   
JESSICA KORDA:   Probably a few others, and they're all really great players.   So I think just feeding off of everything and learning more, more about the professional side of things.
