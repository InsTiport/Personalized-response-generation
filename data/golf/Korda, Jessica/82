Q.   Great round today.   Got yourself right back into the tournament with a 5‑under.   What was the difference from yesterday to today? 
JESSICA KORDA:   Just I think a little bit more of a solid play and made some putts, which was nice. 

Q.   The scoring has not been so phenomenal for the rest of the girls, so why do you think it worked for you? 
JESSICA KORDA:   It's a little bit windier, tougher conditions obviously.   I got out there this morning, which I think the greens were a little bit nicer and not as stomped on.   We were the last group yesterday, so obviously give and take some.

Q.   Are you particularly keen on playing in the wind or do you find it not a problem for you? 
JESSICA KORDA:   Either way, it's fine.   I like the tougher conditions.   I think it makes you think a little more about the golf course.   I don't know, I guess being a longer player, the tougher conditions are more favourable to me.

Q.   Difference from yesterday to today, putting, driving? 
JESSICA KORDA:   Just putts were falling.   It's one of those things that sometimes you hit good shots, good putts and they just don't drop and today they were.   So hopefully they continue for the rest of the week. 

Q.   What was the lengths of the putts? 
JESSICA KORDA:   They were all quite long.   I think I only had like one or two tap‑ins.   They were all 20, 25 feet. 

Q.   Was there any hole that you think, wow, a particular hole where there was a long one? 
JESSICA KORDA:   It was on the back nine.   It was on 16.   16 was quite a long one, left‑to‑right kind of swinger, which I was like, whoa, yeah, that looks good.

Q.   How long was that one?
JESSICA KORDA:   Probably 30 feet.
