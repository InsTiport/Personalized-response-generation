Q. Terrific round of 68, your first experience in contention in a championship of this stature, how would you scribe the experience?
LAURIE CANTER:   It's been good.  Like I said to you on the golf course, just been trying to stay into what I'm doing.  It is obviously a massive tournament but the golf doesn't really change for me.  I'm just going to keep sort of plodding away and doing that and hopefully can finish right up there.
Q. Three full seasons for you on The European Tour before this year, never finished inside the top 150 on The Race to Dubai, you're currently 44th and now doing what you're doing this week, what has been the difference?  What's changed?
LAURIE CANTER:   I don't know, I honestly couldn't really tell you to be honest.  I think the chance we had when we were locked down to reflect a bit on things I was going to do differently when I came back, and I've done a few little things differently.  But they would be so kind of inconsequential you wouldn't necessarily notice to be honest.
I've tried to reflect a bit more on myself and take a bit more on myself, and you know, I've got good coaches who have helped me and all that kind of stuff, but it would be hard to tell you honestly what it was.
Q. You're now in great position to potentially win this marquis championship, $3 million first prize and three-year exemption, it could be life changing couldn't it?
LAURIE CANTER:   Yeah, I guess.  To be honest I haven't thought about it that much.  I guess if you put my name next to the rest of the Top-10 it would change my guys more than the other nine guys, let's be honest.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Right now, I just need a good feed and then have a good sleep, wake up tomorrow and see what I turn up with and obviously do my best.
