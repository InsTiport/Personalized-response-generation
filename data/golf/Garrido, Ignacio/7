 Q. How did you feel about your position today? Clearly maybe 16th was the critical hole for you. 
 IGNACIO GARRIDO: Yeah, well, probably was the only bad shot that I hit today. And actually, it was the right place to miss the green if you wanted to miss it, but, well, I wasn't very lucky with the lie of the ball. 
 I went for it, because I had not a chance and it didn't come out and I knew then that the tournament was over for me. I'm pretty happy with my performance. I think I played quite solid and gave myself a chance, but he played fantastic. I mean, he was very solid from the beginning to the end, and never shook. 
 I was impressed. I was impressed, I must say. For the first time to be leading the tournament, I know how tough it is to go out there and try and put the same game you did the first few days, and he did even better, so all credit to him.

 Q. Important to you to secure third place?
 IGNACIO GARRIDO: I have to say that once I made a double-bogey on 16, it was a bit disappointing, you know. I mean, I was trying to win it obviously. But obviously the higher, the better. So I was trying to finish at least with a good feeling after that double-bogey. And that's what I did.
