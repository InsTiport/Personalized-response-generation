   FABER JAMERSON: Story of the week is bad putting, that's all it is. I think I had 36 and 35 putts for the week over two days. That was the difference.   
  
  Q. Was it the speed or --  
 FABER JAMERSON: I thought everything. I thought everything. That was it.   
  
  Q. Beginning of the back nine sort of stalled your momentum yesterday, and then obviously you didn't get anything going today. What about those four or five holes there?  
 FABER JAMERSON: The four or five holes to start the back nine, those are some of the easiest holes on the golf course, and if you don't take advantage of those, you might as well forget it.   
  
  Q. Sum up your week, though; are you itching to get back and try to qualify next year? Talk about your experience.   
 FABER JAMERSON: It was good. Obviously nowhere near the result of what we had planned for. But we'll see what happens next year.
