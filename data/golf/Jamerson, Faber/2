 Q. How does it feel to be one of the 20 club PGA professionals out there?
 FABER JAMERSON: Felt fine. It's just a new experience for me. I mean, this was my first real Tour event, to, so to make the first Tour event a major -- a little tough starting off the round but it was a good feeling to be out there.

 Q. How about having Rick Schuller on your bag?
 FABER JAMERSON: Really helps a whole lot, drawing from the experiences he had here in 2001. He's a really good caddie, too. I don't know about him raking the bunker, he's a little tired, now. But very nice to have him on the bag, very calming at times and unfortunately he can't hit it occasionally.

 Q. How did the course play? 
 FABER JAMERSON: To be frank with you, I thought it played a lot easier than where we have been playing it. So I was kind of shocked that it was playing as easy as it was, and I feel like I missed an opportunity there. 

 Q. Tell me about 18, a lot of discussion over the club and ended up being the right one?
 FABER JAMERSON: We were sitting there, I think we had 219-hole and 209 to cover, and the wind, it came up. I had to step on it, step on a 4-iron, and sure enough, it worked out okay. Just didn't make the putt. 

 Q. You have a lot of friends and family with you this week? 
 FABER JAMERSON: I have my parents with me, a bunch of people from back home and my fiancÃ©e is here, as well. So good support group.

 Q. How were the nerves for you?
 FABER JAMERSON: Started off, really wasn't that bad. I was more nervous on the range than I was on the first tee.
