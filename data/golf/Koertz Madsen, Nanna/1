Q. First round here in Canada.  Off to a rocky start, but how did you manage to come back from back-to-back bogeys?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, rough start.  Hit a lot of bad shots in the beginning.  We were trying to just make it the even; that's what we talked about, to make it even on the front nine.
But I had two good birdies and then 9 is a good birdie chance, so I end up being 1-under.
And then there's a lot of good birdie chances on the back nine.  I took advantage of them.
Q. Yeah, I mean, conditions were okay; weather was to your advantage.
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah, yeah, there was no wind out there.  It was easy today, yeah.
Q. Good.  And so you also hit the eagle on the par-4, 14th.  Tell us how that went.  15?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Yeah.  So, yeah, driver fairway; pushed my 3-wood and then I hit a chip that was a little too long but landed right in between the green and the fringe.
So there was a little sand so it took a little speed off.  It was still hard, so it hit the pin, slammed into the pin, and, yeah, the pin stopped it.  It was lucky and good.
Q. Are you a player to watch the leaderboard as the round goes on?  At when point were you feeling good about your position?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: I would probably lie if I said I wouldn't look at the leaderboard.  I try not to but I'm always doing it.
After the eagle you felt like, Hey, I can be a little up there.
Q. Sure.  What's the strategy going into the second round?
NANNA KOERSTZ MADSEN: Maybe try get a little better start so I won't have to fight too much to come back.
Yeah, and just, I don't know, try and make some birdies.  Tomorrow morning I think should be a little more wind so should be a little tougher.  Yeah, just try and keep the ball in the fairways and hit the greens.
