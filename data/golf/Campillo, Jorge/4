 Q.  Fantastic final round from you, unusual to get one eagle on this golf course but you've come up with two today?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: It actually was a great round.  I hit a great shot on 4 when the tees were up and I hit a great shot to maybe eight feet and the last on 17, I hit a great 3-wood that was quite far from the green and I make obviously a great putt.  It was nice.   
 Q.  Fantastic front nine from you, just 29 shots.  Were you more aggressive because of the lead that Erik had overnight?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, I think I was pretty aggressive.  I know I have to shoot a low score to have a chance to win the tournament and I played great the front nine.  I even missed another three birdies I could have made.  Obviously made some great putts but it was a great nine.   
The back nine was a little worse, but the wind is getting up and it wasn't easy.   
 Q.  Obviously you're still very much in the mix, still players out on course.  What's going through your mind at the moment?  Do you think you might have enough in the bag?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Well, I thought I need birdie, birdie to have a chance.  Eagle, birdie, or with eagle, par, was the same, but hopefully, I get lucky this time.  I finish second some other times, and if not, I'll keep trying.
