 Q.  I guess there's one place to start.  Talk us through the hole-in-one.  
JORGE CAMPILLO: It was 167 I think yards to the pin.  So it was an 8-iron.  It was helping.  So a little easy 8-iron and the ball was just two meters right of the hole.  I saw it landed kind of soft and I told my caddie, it's probably close to going in.  Some people clapped on top but not many people out there, so I didn't know the ball went in.   
We got to the green and just two balls on the green, so I figured it was in the hole.   
 Q.  How many have you had in your career?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: In a tournament, this is my second on The European Tour.  I have one on The Challenge Tour, as well, and a few other ones with other competition.  So second one.   
 Q.  Well, they are always lovely.  This one in particular, really knocks you up that leaderboard, doesn't it?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: That's right.  It was a good round.  I wasn't playing good the last -- maybe from 7 to 13, I was playing kind of bad actually, and I know the hole-in-one gave me confidence to play the last few holes.   
 Q.  Looking at the entry list, we would expect you to play well and you've been in good form and this is a Mediterranean course.  I don't know if it works like that.  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, I guess so.  I've been playing good all season.  I've been solid.  But yeah, it's obviously nice to start the tournament like this.  Still have 54 holes to go, so we'll see.   
 Q.  Does it feel like a little part of home?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Turkey?  Well, yeah, it's kind of, yeah, like home.  South of Spain, Portugal, it's kind of like this.  So feels kind of like home, yeah.
