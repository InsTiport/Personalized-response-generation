Q. Eight birdies, no bogeys.  What went right for you out there today?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Thank you.  I played well the same as yesterday but I didn't make any mistakes.  Yesterday I made a few mistakes but I played solid.  I hit all of the fairways, a lot of greens and I make the putts that I have to make.  It was a nice day to shoot low and I played good, actually.
Q. Scoring is quite low this morning.  Is it almost perfect out there?
JORGE CAMPILLO: It was perfect.  No wind.  The greens are perfect, and every time I look up, everyone is making a putt.  The rough is a little lower than normally.  I mean, it's perfect to shoot low.  You still have to do it but it's a great day to play golf.
Q. I think it's your second appearance here.  Is it a place, a course you grow into over the years, and when you come back, you feel more confident here?
JORGE CAMPILLO: I always like to come here to the Emirates and play golf.  I have a Top-10 here I think, and I normally play good around here.  So I do like the course.  I think it's a fair course.  It's a tough but it's playing easy but it can play hard with the wind.
Q. You had a good result last week.  Carrying that form into this week?
JORGE CAMPILLO: I played good last week.  Practising hard this winter and I'm glad the work is paying off.
