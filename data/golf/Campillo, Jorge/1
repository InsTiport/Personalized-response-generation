Q. What's been key for you do you feel yesterday and today in posting those numbers?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Well competing good, because my game wasn't quite good.  Obviously in the back nine I play great, but I was struggling off the tee.  I believe I hit seven or eight fairways in two days and I putted great, so it was competing good and putting good.
Q. How do you look this course?  Quirky in some respects.  How are you enjoying the test?
JORGE CAMPILLO: It's tough.  It's hard to hit the fairways out her with the side winds and side fairways that are quite firm as well, so it's not easy to hit the fairways.
I guess the people is missing the fairways, too.  They're what they are.  I think No. 5 is fun to play; No.4, I don't like it as much.
But it's a great golf course overall.
Q. You played well and obviously the winner in Morocco.  How pleased do you feel with the season to this point and obviously big run of events coming up?
JORGE CAMPILLO: It's been great.  I had a great season last year and I have a great season this year, too.  I finally got my first win.  I'm kind of relief for that, I guess.  Hopefully I can finish strong.  Last year I was good after this week.  I remember I finish good here so I got maybe top 10 ranking and didn't finish that good, so I have to finish strong this year.
