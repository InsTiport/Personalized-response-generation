 Q.  Tell me your thoughts on shooting a lovely low score that's put you up the leaderboard.  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Played pretty solid.  Didn't miss any fairways, so that helps.  Especially I made a few long putts.  It was a great round.  I enjoyed it.   
 Q.  Looked better at the start when you were 5-under par through seven holes?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, it was very good. I missed maybe a 6-footer on 14.  I hit a short one, and then another 6-footer on 17.  So it was a great start, and then the back nine, I played a little worse on the front nine, but it was still good.   
 Q.  Obviously on a leaderboard like that, the eagle, that stands out.  So tell us about the eagle two?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: It was a perfect 3-wood.  When I hit it, I thought it's a perfect shot.  It just went maybe, I don't know, 15 feet from the hole, long and right.  The putt, actually I thought I leave it short and then I started walking and the ball went in, so that was good.   
 Q.  It was a testing wind, wasn't it?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: It got windy after the first few holes.  I thought it was less windy, but it was quite windy at the end.  It's a nice course, and with this wind, it's nice to play this course on this wind and hopefully it's windier on the weekend.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy the challenge, the creativity of links golf?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, I don't mind it.  It's just different.  You have to get used to this kind of game, and I do enjoy it coming here and play golf.  When it's sunny obviously it's much better.
