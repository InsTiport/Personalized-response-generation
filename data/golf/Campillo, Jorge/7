 Q.  Do you feel this is a continuation of your play recently?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, playing solid.  I hit a few -- I just missed a few fairways and a few greens.  I hit it pretty straight out here, which is good.  I hit good iron shots and putting was good, so it was a solid round.   
 Q.  Do you feel it's a golf course that suits you?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: I guess so.  You know, when you are playing good, every golf course feels like they suit you.  You know, but they are -- I like this golf course, this type of golf course with all the options off the tee.  Yeah, it's nice.  Hopefully I can keep playing like this.   
 Q.  What's been the key to your good play this season?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: I worked hard this winter.  I had made a few changes on my swing and the work is paying off.   
 Q.  Slightly different format this week.  Is it all about getting in that sort of top 64, because anything can happen after that.  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, obviously.  If you are top 16, you have a chance in the first round, but yeah, once you are in the 64, yeah, anyone can win.  But it's obviously better to be in the top 16 because you have better chances of winning the first round.  But you never know, you may win the first two days and lose in the first round, or the other way around.  It will be fun on the weekend.   
 Q.  Do you think your game is ready to win out here on Tour?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: I think so.  Just need a bit of lucky guess.  I finished second, third, fourth and fifth this year, so it's getting closer.  Hopefully this week, if not next week, even better.
