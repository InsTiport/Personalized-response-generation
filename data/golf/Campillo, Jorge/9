 Q.  Well played today, 6-under.  How does that feel?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Good.  I finished strong.  Just sad I couldn't make that two-metre putt on 17 and I didn't birdie 18 from the fairway.  But overall, it was a good round.   
 Q.  The week overall, obviously not the round you wanted yesterday.  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, a little inconsistent.  I didn't play that great.  I putted good all week but yeah, yesterday was a tough day.  I was able to come back a little on the back nine.   
And today, it was a tough start, and then the back nine I played better.  So it was a good round.   
 Q.  A positive, coming into this week, at the start of the week, would you have taken this position?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: I guess so, yeah.  It's always good to finish well.  I don't know how I'm going to finish, because probably other guys are going to pass me.  But it was a good week; a few good rounds, and maybe next week I can have four good rounds in a row and see if I can finish better than this week.
