Q.   Can you tell me about that last hole? 
JORGE CAMPILO:   Yeah, it's a good finish.   Make good birdie on the 17.   Good up‑and‑down.   And then on 18, I have a perfect, perfect distance for the hybrid, just pushed it a little bit.   I got into the bunker and it was an uphill lie, perfect lie and just hit a good shot, hit a perfect shot.   As soon as I saw it land, I thought, it's going to be very close.   I got lucky there.

Q.   Puts you in good position going into the rest of the week.   You must be happy with where you are?
JORGE CAMPILO:   It's one day.   I still have 54 holes to go.   So still a lot of holes to play on this tough, tough golf course, but this obviously is better than starting with 73 or 74.

Q.   Do you enjoy this tournament and this course?
JORGE CAMPILO:   Yeah, I enjoy the tournament.   I haven't played good here.   Always play bad actually.   So sometimes you've got to play good.   Last year I made the cut right on the number, so that was a little better and hopefully this year is better than last year.

Q.   What was the difference today?   You've obviously come into a bit of form in Spain.
JORGE CAMPILO:   Yeah, I played good, pretty solid.   Long iron off the tee and then my irons were pretty good, too.   Got unlucky a few times because like on 7, on 16, I hit good shots and they land on top of the hills and came back all the way down but obviously I make the bunker shot on 18, so it's even now.

Q.   Are you looking forward to the rest of the week and maybe after tomorrow, Saturday, you might have a nice draw on one of the final groups? 
JORGE CAMPILO:   Yeah, hopefully it will be nice.   If the weather is still like this, it's a really nice tournament to play.
