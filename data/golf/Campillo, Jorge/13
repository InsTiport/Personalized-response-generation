Q. Tell me how nice a round of 67 is when everybody else seems to be struggling in the winds?
JORGE CAMPILLO: I played pretty solid.  I hardly missed any shots.  I made the putts that I had to make, so I am pretty happy about it.  I played the last two holes very good, as well where I end up just saving good pars.
I don't know, it was a tough day.  The wind here, you don't know where it's coming from.  It's a tough track, but I enjoyed it.  I played solid today.
Q. You often have to keep the ball under the tree line.  Is that the case today?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Not really.  I was just trying to make a few good swings.  There are a lot of hard tee shots out here, but I managed to keep the ball in play, and I putted very good, as well.
Q. Is this the best round you've ever played across the West Course?
JORGE CAMPILLO: I think so, last year I started with 68, I remember, so this is one shot better.
Q. Why is that?  Because you get used to the nature of how to play it, is it weather conditions, or are you simply a better player?
JORGE CAMPILLO: It was a little bit of everything.  It was nice weather today.  You get used to the course.  It's quite a tricky course, so the more rounds you play, the better you are, and maybe I'm a little bit of a better player, as well.
Q. And are you getting used to being up there, because it's week-after-week you're putting in good performances?
JORGE CAMPILLO: I just keep trying to be up there every week, and maybe one week I can be on top of the leaderboard.  If not, I keep trying.  But the more weeks you are up there, the better chance we have obviously.
