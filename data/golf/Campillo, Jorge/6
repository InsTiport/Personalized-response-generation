Q. Second consectuvie 67, which round pleased you?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Very were pretty similar.  I played solid both rounds and hit a bunch of greens.  I'm happy with both rounds.  Today it was cold in the morning and it wasn't playing easy the first few holes.  Conditions were similar.  It was cold for the first few holes, so No. 10 and 13, they were playing tough, but after that, yeah, it's not as windy as yesterday.  So it was playing easy.
But this golf course, it doesn't play easy.  It's a tricky course.  It's a nice test.
Q. Nice run from the first?
JORGE CAMPILLO: I hit a great tee shot on 1.  Sand wedge to two feet, so it was an easy birdie there and I make a great putt on 2, about 50 feet.  It was a little more, actually.
An easy putt on 3.  I hit a great pitching wedge and two putts, and then on No. 4, I hit it a little left of the tee and hit a wedge in pretty good, as well, nine feet, and it went in.  It was very good.  Solid.
Q. Are you aware of the seeding and the advantage of being a seeding?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, I wish it was a medal play tournament in the position I am in right now but it is what it is.  It is better being on the top than on the bottom but you still have to win tomorrow.
Q. Is it going to be more attacking golf tomorrow, a lot of birdies to try to get it done?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Well, if it was match play, I would say yes.  But this medal match play, you still have to be careful.  You can have a high number on a hole and that can get you two or three shots on one hole.  You still have to play the same golf I think.  It's a nice format I guess if you are playing good to play medal match play than regular match play.
