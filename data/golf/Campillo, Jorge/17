Q.   So what's your verdict on the two days so far?
JORGE CAMPILLO:   Well, yesterday I played really good. Today wasn't as good.   I didn't hit the ball that good but I still shoot low.   I took advantage of the par 5s so I'm kind of happy with my day.

Q.   What made it tougher today? 
JORGE CAMPILLO:   It was a little windier I thought.   I hit it longer in the morning I guess without the sun.   I think the pins were a little harder, too.   Besides that, the greens were good.   So it was easy to make putts, but yeah it was playing a little tougher for me.

Q.   While we are still waiting on the other half of the field that means you're in a very good position. 
JORGE CAMPILLO:   Yeah, still lots of holes to play but I am in good position and we'll see if I can play like this on the weekend.

Q.   Is this one of the best periods you've had in terms of play?
JORGE CAMPILLO:   Yeah, I guess, I'm playing good now.   I've been practicing good for the last couple months.   The scoring wasn't good but now the scores are good, too, so hopefully I can play good for the rest of the summer.

Q.   I know you're a truly talented player but is it down to experience, as well? 
JORGE CAMPILLO:   Well, it does, obviously I didn't play that many tournaments on Tour, and obviously the more and more I play, the easier it gets obviously.   So the experience, I know I can play, but sometimes it gets really hard, I lose my patience and the other guys never do.
