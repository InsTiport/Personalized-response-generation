Q. Yet again, you're in contention at a European Tour event.  How are you feeling?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Good.  I played solid today.  Better than yesterday.  I got a few good up-and-downs and I made a few good putts.  It was a good round.  Tough day.
Q. What do you have to do tomorrow, given all your experiences and your top finishes, you are still searching for a victory, No. 1, but surely it's got to be around the corner?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, hopefully.  I've been there way too many times, but I think you've got to be in position to win, so I'm in position and hopefully tomorrow is the day.
Q. And what do you talk about with your close friends, your confidants, your coach, about what you need to do to bring it up to the next level?  You're certainly knocking on the door.
JORGE CAMPILLO: That's right.  I don't know, just talk about, they tell me all the time, be patient, be patient, you're going to win, so I just believe in that.  Tomorrow will be another chance and hopefully I win this time.
Q. You have thrown in some great performances in final rounds, and you spoke to us during the week about perhaps being more aggressive.  What do you need to do, is it patience or is it aggression?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Patience to win and I have to be aggressive to win tomorrow.  I'll be patient; if I don't win tomorrow, I'll be patient and try some other weeks, but tomorrow I'll try to play aggressive like I did today and hopefully I can make the putts and hit it good off the tee.
