Q. What are your thoughts on victory over John Daly?
JORGE CAMPILLO: It was a little consistent the first few holes we played, some bad shots.  But at the end it was a tough game.  He made a few back-to-back birdies.
So got it to 1-down and I played good the last four holes.  I birdied 15.  Great up-and-down on 16 and then he bogeyed 17.  And then 18, I had a very good hole, as well.  So I'm proud of the way I finished, and winning this match, it wasn't easy after 14 holes.
Q. What you said prior to the tournament, you were looking forward to this first match and excited by it.  Was it everything that you thought it would be?
JORGE CAMPILLO: Yeah, yeah, he was a really nice guy.  He said good shot every time I hit a good shot.  I talked to him quite a lot.  It was a good game.  He was a nice guy.
Q. That's the nature of match play, isn't it?  Birdie, double-bogey --
JORGE CAMPILLO: I started good but then I hit in the bunker on the second and tried to go for the green.  In mid all play, I never do that.  Made a double-bogey there when I was putting for bogey with no chance to win the hole.  No. 4, it was an awful hole.  I hit over the green there.  I have no chance.  And the same, I have four or five metres for bogey that didn't matter.
Q. But in stroke play, if you had a double-bogey, it can mess with your head.  In match play, do you just get on with it?
JORGE CAMPILLO: It's just one hole.  If I play those holes more aggressive than I normally do.  But you've got to think on the next hole; that's the good thing with match play.  You play a bad hole, you don't lose that match.
