JORGE CAMPILLO: Good setup, and the weather was decent, too.  I think it was a good decision by The European Tour.  They set up the course good and they made the right decision.  So it was fair and I'm happy we got to play.   
 Q.  How difficult was it for you out there in the wind?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: It was tough at first.  You've got to get used to the wind and how slow the greens are.  After the start, kind of the wind died down a little bit and it was playing fair.  I think it was a great day.   
 Q.  Even sunshine for a moment.  Were you conscious of looking up that leaderboard and closing a little bit of a gap?  
JORGE CAMPILLO: Well, I only saw one leaderboard on the whole golf course.  It was on No. 9.  Yeah, I saw I was third or fourth when I was playing 9.  I was just trying to finish the round, trying to not get wet, and we did.   
So I'm happy the way I finished, as well, because I started bogey, bogey and I came back pretty good.
