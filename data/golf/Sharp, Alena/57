  Q. How was your day?  
 ALENA SHARP: It was good. I started off a little rough. I was 2-over after eight and 1-under after five and hit a bad tee shot and a three-putt. Once I got the birdie on 9 I got my momentum and my rhythm and I played really well on the backside. I think the front is a little bit more difficult than the back, and I just wasn't playing aggressive. I was kind of timid out there. But I felt like the last time -- actually the last ten holes I played were really back to the way I was playing about a month ago.   
 I'm happy to finish at 1-under.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like you're well within reach of the leaders right now?  
 ALENA SHARP: I think so. I mean, this golf course, where they can put the pins, it can be very difficult. I didn't shoot myself in the foot today, and I'm not that far off. I can shoot 66 out here. I'm getting more confident as the year goes on. I feel like I can do that out here.   
 As long as you keep the ball in the fairway, you can do that and make some putts, and I putted well today. So I'm looking forward to playing tomorrow morning on fresh greens.   
  
  Q. You guys all started out pretty hot.   
 ALENA SHARP: Yeah, 1- or 2-under, yeah, and then we had a couple -- we all doubled No. 6. Then I don't know, kind of coasted along, I made a few birdies in a row and made a birdie on 16 to go 1-under, so I was happy with that. I wanted to get one of my last three. The pin on 18 today is a little tough to get at.
