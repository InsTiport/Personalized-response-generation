Q. So did you know what the plans for the bag were or that it was going up for auction?
ALENA SHARP: I knew it was going to go up for auction, but I didn't know it was going to go up for auction this quickly.  I thought it was going to be around the 8th of September.  And to come off the golf course and see an email from my agent about the bag raised 19,000, like it made me cry and gave me goosebumps.  And Sara's like, what's wrong?  She didn't know what was going on.  Just unbelievable.  I was at a loss for words.  And so happy that we could raise that much money in awareness.  And be able to give it back to the Humboldt children.  That's just something that's made my year, really.
Q. So it was the Jim Patterson Foundation that auctioned it off, right?
ALENA SHARP: Right.
Q. And the money is specifically going to Humboldt?
ALENA SHARP: That's what the email said, yeah.
Q. Awesome.  Do you know who bought it or anything like that?
ALENA SHARP: We're working on that, because we definitely want to send them a thank you for being so generous.
Q. I've got to say that's got to help your spirits going into tomorrow, too?
ALENA SHARP: Totally.  I had an okay day today, but it makes tonight and dinner taste a little bit better, and just celebrate and enjoy the rest of the day knowing that I did something pretty amazing to help people.
