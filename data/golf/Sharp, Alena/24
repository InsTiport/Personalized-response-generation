 Q.  Still got to feel good, right?  
ALENA SHARP: Yeah, I mean, started off really well.  Adrenaline was flowing.  I hit some long shots that got me into trouble.  Like on 8 I hit a pitching wedge 138 yards, which I don't hit it that far.  I thought it was good and then it was up top and it's tough to two-putt from there.  That kind of was a drag.   
Other than that, I was right there all day.  Last hole hit a good drive and kind of hit in the rough and stayed there and had mud on it; my shot went dead right, which sucks to end the tournament like that.  It was nice to be that position and know that I could do it, you, know, that I was in there all day and never gave up, just kept fighting, and kept hitting it close and trying to make those putts.
