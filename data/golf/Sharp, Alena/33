ALENA SHARP: Made a double on the second hole, but just really calmed myself down and knew that I could make birdies and I did.  I made an eagle to get it back four holes later.  So, just stuck in there.  Glad we got done last night.  We were kind of running to get finished and birdied the last hole to shoot 4-under.  I was really happy to start off much better this year than in 2009, and today it was smooth sailing all day.  Just really I was comfortable out there.  Felt good to hit good shots and make putts.
Q. (Inaudible)?
ALENA SHARP: Sometimes.  I mean, I knew that I was up there.  I wasn't changing my game plan based on that because there are still 36 holes left.  But I'm glad to be kind of in the right spot to make a run at this this weekend.
Q. I know that you want to be in the right spot (Inaudible).
ALENA SHARP: Yeah.  Especially here, yeah.  I haven't played well at the Canadian Open since 2007, so this means a lot to me to get a good start.  I've been playing well.  I played well last week.  The score didn't really show and putts started to drop this week, and hope it can continue this weekend.
Q. You say you were not playing well (Inaudible)?
ALENA SHARP: I think a little bit of it was mental, but I also would come to this point in the tournament in the year and still worry about being full status.  And this year I'm 44th on the money list coming in, and my game is so much better this year.  I just have more confidence so I'm not even thinking about that.  I was nervous yesterday to get started, but I wasn't nervous in the way that I'd been in the past.
So it was nice to play with the good nerves and not the distracting, oh, I've got to make money this week to keep my card.  I can just enjoy it, and take in everything this week.  It's easier, that's for sure.
Q. You mentioned confidence.  How confident are you that you can keep rolling on the weekend?
ALENA SHARP: Yeah, I'm driving it well.  I feel like I'm not hitting driver on every hole because I don't need it because it's firm.  So my 3-wood, I hit a draw with it and I hit a cut with my driver, so I have options off the tee.  I missed a couple fairways today, but I got away with it because I had wedges in my hand.  So I'm using my length to my advantage, and I feel like the way I'm striking it and putts are going in, I have a good shot at it.  Now I've just got to play a couple more rounds and see where it is on Sunday.
Q. (Inaudible) Henderson's up there, Lee's up there.  How nice is it to see a bunch of Canadians in the mix?
ALENA SHARP: It's always good to see the Canadian flag on the leaderboard no matter where we are, but definitely this week.  I know in the past we haven't done well as a group, the Canadians, so it's nice to see halfway through we've got some people up there.  Hopefully, we can continue it on the weekend.
Q. (Inaudible)?
ALENA SHARP: Well, right now I would say the closing ceremonies.  There was a tunnel and we're walking as one, Team Canada.  Not every team did that, but we stayed together, and just walking into the tunnel and who cares if it was raining.  We were walking into the stadium with all these people cheering for us, and I'll never forget that.  I'm glad I stayed.
My goal now is to get to Tokyo and I want to go for the opening.  So I'm going to go for the whole two weeks next time.  So that's one thing that will really stick out in my mind.  And then being announced on the first day before the first tee shot, it's different how they announce you, because they're right in your face with the camera, so you have to smile and not try to be so nervous, but it's nerve-racking.  Just to be announced from Canada at the Olympics, that was another thing that I'll never forget.
Q. (Inaudible) feels like you kind of had gotten involved a little bit with Team Canada.  (Inaudible) has that given you a boost at all?
ALENA SHARP: Yeah, last year I started working with Tristan Mullally, and he's been great for me.  He's helped me out a lot.  My game is more consistent tee to green now, and he's helped me a little bit with did with mental game.  He asked me to come and speak to them, and I said, sure.  I was a little nervous going into that talking to some teenagers and amateurs.
I love doing it.  I love to give back and help, and I'm glad that they asked me, and I want to be there in any way that I can.  They're great kids, so I want to see them do well.
Q. (Inaudible)?
ALENA SHARP: They didn't make it out this week.  My mom's actually watching my dog.  It was hard for her to get out here.  I'm tempted to fly her out, but next week they'll be out.  They've been out for a few tournaments this year.  They're really big supporters.  I wish that they were here, it's too bad that they're not, but next week I'll get to see them.
