   ALENA SHARP: I played decent today. Just the wind, I hit a few bad shots in the wind and short-sided myself. It's hard on this golf course when you short side yourself to get it up and down. The greens are really firm and you have to hit a perfect chip.   
 I didn't execute the ones that I wanted to the way I wanted to, but making that putt on the last hole in front of the hometown crowd was amazing.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)   
 ALENA SHARP: I didn't even know. I knew -- I thought Lorie was playing well today. I saw her sign and she  
was ahead of me by a few shots, so I had no idea that I beat her.   
 You know, it doesn't really matter to me. I want to keep playing well on the weekends and I haven't been doing that.   
 To be 2 under on the last three is something that I can take to the next week. It's a hard week playing as a Canadian at the Canadian Open. It's so nice to have everybody pulling for you. You feel like you disappoint them a little bit, but I'm just very happy that the tournament is done and I finished it the way I did.  
  
  Q. Is it a catch 22, that everyone supports you so well and you carry the whole nation on your back?   
 ALENA SHARP: Yeah, because we want a Canadian to win an LPGA event and it hasn't happened for a few years. Lorie was the last one to do it. It'll come soon.
