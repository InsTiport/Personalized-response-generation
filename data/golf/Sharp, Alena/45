Q.     Give us an update on Erin the Team Erin, the hashtag. 
ALENA SHARP:   We started doing Team Erin basically right after ShopRite.   So we just started calling it Team Erin.   That included everybody, like everybody at the hospital and family and friends.
Just easier to do that.   So on the Caring Bridge it's called Team Erin.
She's definitely changed a little bit from two weeks ago when I was here before I went to Arkansas.   She wasn't as alert with her eyes and now she is.
She's getting more emotion and moving her right arm and right leg more.   So it's slow progress.   It's just going to take a long time.

Q.   I know you said it was important too for the Caring Bridge, trying to get people to help donate there. 
ALENA SHARP:   The GoFundMe account.   Yeah, she has an Erin Lynch medical account on GoFundMe.com, and anything that can be donated to help would be amazing.
So I am going to try to play my hardest this summer and give them a check at the end of the year.

Q.   I know you said you came up before Arkansas; is that right? 
ALENA SHARP:   Yeah.

Q.   What made you do that?
ALENA SHARP:   Originally I was supposed to fly out of Detroit.   My dogs you were going to stay here.   We organized it before the accident, so I couldn't change my flights.   Ended up I cam here for a couple days and then went out of Detroit.   Parked my car there.   I left my dogs on the my parents' house and flew to Arkansas, flew home, and came back up through Detroit, went home, and then and came here this week.
So it's been a lot of traveling.   Supposed to be just here and hanging out here before Arkansas and then afterwards.   But it worked out.   Just glad that Erin is getting a little bit better. 

Q.   So you got see her again before Arkansas and then again before this week?
ALENA SHARP:   Yeah.   I saw her a couple times this week already.   Saw her yesterday and she actually was smiling and laughing for 20 seconds, which I hadn't got to see.   I'd heard about it, but didn't get to see it until yesterday. 
I thought that was very cool.

Q.   How important is it for to you play well this week with all that's going on around?
ALENA SHARP:   Yeah, it's important.   It's hard not put too much pressure on myself.   Just trying to take it one step at a time and not get ahead of myself.
I was getting a little frustrated today because I wasn't making putts, and then finally they started going in.   That's just golf.
Just want to keep doing that tomorrow.   I am glad I finished well today and don't have to be behind the eight ball going into the second round.

Q.   You said your caddie slipped a photo in on the second hole.
ALENA SHARP:   Yeah.   Well, she usually writes on my pin sheets like some like quotes.   Basically they're quotes that make you think instead of thinking about golf.   Positive things. 
I get on to the 11th hole, which is my second hole, and open my book and I see the picture in there.   I just started to tear up, because it was the picture of us from last year, Erin and I.   She standard bearer for me last year.   She wasn't supposed to and she surprised me, so we got a picture of it. 
That's the one she put in my yardage book. 

Q.   How important is it for you to be here this week?   I know you said you could have been at the PanAm Games, and obviously would've loved to represent you country, but at the same time be here as well. 
ALENA SHARP:   Yeah.   Because, again, this is a staple on the LPGA Tour.   It's one of our longestâ€‘running events.   I always love playing here.   I've played well here and I've played horrible here, and I definitely want to get back to how I played when I first was on tour.
And the Lynch family, they're like my second family.   To not come to this event, I wouldn't be able to handle it.   Almost feels like a second home.

Q.   Right, right.   Who is all doing the Team Erin? 
ALENA SHARP:   I got Antigua to do the shirts for my caddie, but I gave Tammy a shirt, which is Erin's mom. 

Q.   Are they out here today? 
ALENA SHARP:   Yeah
