Q. Could you just tell us a little bit about today's round?
ALENA SHARP:   Played pretty solid.  Missing it by one doesn't feel great coming off the last green.  I had a chance and didn't make a putt.  You know, just tough.  This is the second U.S. Open in a row that I missed it by one.
Q. Challenges you face playing two different golf courses?
ALENA SHARP:   Well, because of the two courses, the one day of less prep on the course you're going to play three times.  A lot of information I guess playing 36, but I thought we had a good game plan.
We got here early enough to learn both courses.
Q. Been a crazy year.  What positives do you have going into 2021 with your game?
ALENA SHARP:   Well, I haven't seen my coach this year and I've played pretty good.
Looking forward to going to see him at the end of this year, to start next year, and have a good plan going forward for next year.
But did a lot of good things this year so far, so I'm happy with how things have been, despite this whole pandemic.  Yeah.
