 Q.  I think there were a few Edmontonians who didn't know Alena Sharp before the week started, but I think there's a lot of people who do know now.  How do you feel now? 
 ALENA SHARP:  It was amazing.  I'm glad I hit it over the water on 18.  It would have been horrible if it went in the water.  I was just in awe walking up to the green, that many people cheering for me.  I've never had that before, and it was a great feeling.  I'll never forget it. 

 Q.  You handled it fairly well.  There were a lot of nerves involved in this situation.  Were you pretty proud of the way you closed? 
 ALENA SHARP:  Yeah, I work with Lynn and Pia through Vision 54, and reading their book and going through their exercises they give you to do, it's helped me, and especially this week.  I really didn't feel nervous except for that last shot coming into 18 because I was in the rough, I didn't know how the ball was going to react. 
 I was really surprised at how calm I was today.  I just played my game, and I hit some great shots today and I had a couple three-putts, but other than that it was a great round of golf.  And to do it on a Sunday here in front of the home crowd, it's an amazing feeling. 

 Q.  What does this weekend maybe do for your career? 
 ALENA SHARP:  It's going to definitely give me more confidence.  I know that I can be one of the best players out here, and playing alongside Karrie Webb, it was a real treat.  I haven't played with a Hall of Famer before.  Well, I've played with Juli Inkster, so I guess she's a Hall of Famer.  But I was really surprised that I was going to be playing with her today, and I really enjoyed it.  She's a nice lady. 

 Q.  Did the crowd help pull you along?  What kind of impact did the crowd have on you throughout the round? 
 ALENA SHARP:  Yeah, it gave me a lot of adrenaline, and I like playing when I have adrenaline.  You don't usually get all these people cheering for you when you're playing in the U.S. being a Canadian, so it was really an amazing feeling. 

 Q.  So is it easier now as far as you know playing in silence or playing with people screaming? 
 ALENA SHARP:  I like playing with the crowd watching me.  But I can play in silence, too, but I'd rather have people watching. 

 Q.  Do you want to talk about your game today?  A lot of the irons, were they playing well today? 
 ALENA SHARP:  Yeah, I missed a few greens, but I got up-and-down every time I missed the green.  I had two three-putts.  I haven't had long putts all weekend, and I hit them a little too hard, but I hit some great shots today.  I had a couple tap-in birdies, and those always help. 

 Q.  Did you hear the drumming, screaming? 
 ALENA SHARP:  Yeah (laughing). 

 Q.  How do you -- 
 ALENA SHARP:  You've just got to try and block it out.  It was a constant noise, so it wasn't too bad. 

 Q.  The field as good as it is, does that make it sweeter? 
 ALENA SHARP:  Yeah, obviously being a Canadian playing in the Canadian Open, it doesn't matter how good the field is.  But yes, this is a strong field, and just added fuel to my fire for the rest of this year.
