ALENA SHARP: I hit a lot of greens, 15 greens, driving it, I don't feel super comfortable on the tee, but I'm just working on a little setup thing, and it's just hard for me to get comfortable.  But I hit a lot of good drives when I needed to.  I had a chip-in.  I made a long putt.  I just need to hit it closer to the hole, and that's what I'm going to work on for tomorrow.  Just get a little more settled with my iron shots.
Q. The greens here, everybody talks about being one of the keys to playing this golf course, keeping it below the hole.  How did you find it today?  Were they firm and fast?
ALENA SHARP: I felt like they were a little slower than they've been all week, maybe like a half a foot, which I think it makes it more playable.  We did well with staying below the hole, and I've just got to keep doing that because it is hard to be aggressive putting from above the hole.  Yeah, you're right, placement on the greens is big, so you can actually make birdies instead of playing defensive with your putter.
