ALENA SHARP: It was a pretty good round.  I didn't make many putts.  It was tough to get it close to the pins.  I thought they were a little trickier today.  The greens are definitely firming up, so you gotta hit high shots in.  I didn't well on the par-5s and really didn't get anything out of the other holes, but good ball striking day and really rolling it well.  So hopefully tomorrow will be a little bit better.   
 Q.  And I don't know if you know this, but right now you're going as low Canadian, minus five.  And I think four Canadians will make the cut.  How does that make you feel?  
ALENA SHARP: It's always good for Canadians to make the cut.  Not really thinking about being low Canadian.  I want to do well, be in contention for the weekend, so I feel like I did a good job the last couple of days, and it's tough in the wind.  So I was happy with how I hit it.   
 Q.  You always play well at this tournament.  Is it a comfort of being just so close to Hamilton?  
ALENA SHARP: Yeah, I feel it's pretty much my backyard.  Hamilton is not too far away.  I feel really comfortable here in the Waterloo area.  I've done well as a junior.  It's nice to be at home.  I have my dogs here this week.  It's always nice to come home and see them.  They're always smiling no matter how I do, so it's always nice to have that little comfort.   
 Q.  How much of a change in conditions from yesterday to today?  Like the wind seemed to be there a lot more yesterday and maybe at times today?  
ALENA SHARP: Yeah.  I think it's -- I don't know what it was like yesterday morning, but we had wind almost right away.  Not as much like the first few holes, which was good because some of those holes downwind with firm greens, it's tough to stop the ball.  But definitely the greens have firmed up and it's making it tougher to get it close to the pin.   
 Q.  Your confidence level is high right now given everything that's happened to you the last couple of weeks with the Olympics and everything.  What's your focus going into the weekend?  Do you think about winning or is it just go in and put together some strong rounds?  
ALENA SHARP: I think it's definitely on my mind that I could get a win here.  Just gotta keep doing what I've been doing, hit the fairways and try and hit high shots into these greens.  And string a couple of good holes together you can make an eagle out there.  It's there.  Just depends on how the wind is the next couple of days.  I think it's supposed to warm up, so maybe it won't be as bad.  But I think it plays to my advantage when it's windy, it's tougher.  So I'm really looking forward to it.  I'm glad I'm in this position again after last week and just need to get some rest and be ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  You've mentioned before that you sharpened up your mental game for the season.  What's going through your head as you're playing so well this tournament?  
ALENA SHARP: I think I'm not thinking as much, which is good, just being an athlete, playing the game and being smart obviously with my decisions off the tee and read the greens well, so I think there's less thinking going on, just playing and really enjoying it, and really I'm not thinking about swing or anything like that.  I'm just really into the target.   
 Q.  Obviously the Olympics are new to the year for you or new to your season.  What kind of impact did it have on what's gone on since?  
ALENA SHARP: I think playing for your country is just a whole different ballgame as opposed to just playing for yourself every week.  And I felt like everybody was behind me.  It's just a different feeling, different mentality.  I think it helped me just put things in perspective, you know, and just I really enjoyed myself and tried to have a good time when I was there, and I did.  And I think just being called an Olympian is just a huge thing to have and it gives you that extra little swagger in your step.   
 Q.  Do you think there's a carryover from that, like these last two tournaments, last tournament and this one?  
ALENA SHARP: I definitely think so.  I said last week, it's nice to come back from Rio and play two events in Canada.  I can't think of a better way to come back from Rio.  It's nice to be able to play in the Canadian open and the Manulife.   
 Q.  Did playing how well do you know your caddy help the communication with you and Sara?  
ALENA SHARP: We have good communication.  She was just trying to trick me.  (Laughs).   
 Q.  What are your dogs' names?  What kind of dogs are they?  
ALENA SHARP: Chandler and Porter, and they're both Goldendoodles.  People would say that porter isn't a Goldendoodle, but he's supposed to be.  He was gold a Goldendoodle.  People think he's a Havanese or a Maltese.  He's our little Goldendoodle.   
 Q.  How many tournaments do they get to come to?  
ALENA SHARP: This year not so much because we crisscrossed the country a lot, but they've been to four this year so far.  Next year I think with the way the schedule is I think they'll be at more.  Four or five.   
 Q.  Are you driving in from Hamilton each day?  
ALENA SHARP: No.  I'm staying here.
