 Q.  Alena, do you want to tell me who you have on the bag this week?  
ALENA SHARP: Yeah, I have Gail Graham on the bag this week.  She was willing to come to China and do next week.  My caddie, Sarah, she had her knee surgery a week ago now.  So she's recovering from ACL reconstruction.   
So I needed somebody to come and work for me this week and next week just to finish out the year.   
 Q.  How was the first round with her out there?  You guys had a pretty good day?  
ALENA SHARP: Yeah, it was good.  She's really knowledgeable.  She's played on Tour, you know, and she's a teacher.  She just gave me a little tip yesterday.  I just looked a little stiff over the ball.  Tried to loosen it up.  Really been playing really well.  Just haven't been scoring well.  It was nice to have a nice first round to start the tournament.
