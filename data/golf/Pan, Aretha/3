   KELLY THESIER: We'd like to welcome Aretha Pan into the interview room. Shot 75 today, our leading Malaysian player at the moment. Can you just take me through your round a little bit today and kind of maybe some key holes for you during the round? 
 ARETHA PAN: Today I would like to say I got luck, and I hit a few bad shots, but still went to the hole. Yeah, and I made a couple of birdies. And yeah, just last hole is too hard, so I made the wrong position and landed in the pond. 
 KELLY THESIER: Sometimes those things happen. This is your second year playing in this event. Can you just talk a little about the golf course and maybe the differences that you've seen from last year to this year? 
 ARETHA PAN: I think the green is much more softer than last year, and the fairway is soft too. I think the course is in quite good condition. 
 KELLY THESIER: Just the experience of getting to play in this type of event in your home country, what is that like? 
 ARETHA PAN: I'm very happy that I qualified for the second time, and I hope I can play better this year.

 Q. (Inaudible)?
 ARETHA PAN: I think I'll just follow my plan, just fairway, green, and just make the putter do the job, and the score will come down by itself.

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 ARETHA PAN: 18 I push my drive to the right, and I took a 5-iron and blocked it to the right. I also landed in the pond. 
 I dropped and I hit it like ten feet, and I missed my bogey putt.

 Q. Your best hole today? 
 ARETHA PAN: My best? Hole one. Yeah, I hit it I got a two-foot birdie putt.

 Q. Where did you start? 
 ARETHA PAN: I started at hole 10.

 Q. Did you have the same caddie today as you did in your qualifying round? 
 ARETHA PAN: Yes.

 Q. How long did you know that caddie? 
 ARETHA PAN: Just before the qualifying, yeah.

 Q. Does he know the course as well as you?
 ARETHA PAN: Yeah, yeah.
