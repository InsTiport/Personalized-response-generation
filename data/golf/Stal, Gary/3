  GARY STAL:   I played a great driver on the fairways, and yeah, I was at 169 from the pin.   I played a 5‑iron perfect and the ball, in two.   
   
 Q.   Very special, and gets your round going I guess.   
GARY STAL:   At the beginning, I play good, very good, and really good putting.   So after I made a lot of birdies.   
   
 Q.   Happy with 66?   Have to be.   
GARY STAL:   Happy, yeah, but the 17th, the bogey, I make a 3‑putt, but it's a good day, 66.
