 Q.   Tell us how good you feel about this round today.  
GARY STAL:   Today I feel very good with my irons.   I play very good my driver, too.   And I not miss a lot of plays, so after I play, I play okay on the fairways.   
   
 Q.   Do you like it here at Wentworth on what is usually a very tough course?   
GARY STAL:   Yeah, I like this course.   It's a very difficult course but today, the rain made the green very more slow, so it was very‑‑ it was‑‑ it will be simple after yesterday, the Pro‑Am.   The green was a bit hard.   
   
 Q.   How well have you played in the run up to this event?   
GARY STAL:   It's the first time‑‑  
   
 Q.   Other weeks, have you been playing well?
