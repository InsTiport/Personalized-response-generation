Q. Great round today.  Can you talk about it a little bit?
BAILEY TARDY: Yeah, I guess yesterday I wasn't really rolling the ball on line, so kind of worked on that yesterday.  Got my putts, the speed down definitely a lot more, and a lot more putts fell today.
Q. You had three birdies in a row, 6, 7, 8?
BAILEY TARDY: Yeah, I hit it pretty close on 15, so I had a little knock-in there.  And then 16 was a par-5 and hit another close one.  Well, I guess this is going backwards, so 6, 7, and then 8, I drained like a 40-footer for birdie.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
Q. What do you think the biggest difference between your play yesterday and today was?
BAILEY TARDY: My putting.  I had two three-putts yesterday and I missed a couple greens.  Definitely my ball-striking was a little bit better, and I'm kind of back in rhythm, and then just on the greens made the biggest difference.
Q. Is this your first Women's Am?
BAILEY TARDY: No, this is maybe my fifth Women's Am.
Q. How many times have you advanced to match play?
BAILEY TARDY: I don't know.  I think I've made it -- I think every time.  I might have missed it once, and I was a toddler.  Yeah, if I missed it, I've kind of blocked it out.  But yeah, I've made match play for the last couple years.
Q. And then going into tomorrow's round of 64, what's your mindset like?
BAILEY TARDY: You know, everyone deserves to be in the top 64.  I've been the No. 1 seed, I've been almost the bottom seed.  It's not even -- you can't even take what number you are.  Everyone is good enough to be out here and go low any day, so just kind of sticking to my game plan and hitting solid shots on every hole.
