Q. When I saw you out here, you were kind of all over the place and you still ended up 2-under.  What was the round like after that?
BAILEY TARDY: I think I hit the ball pretty solid throughout my whole round.  I was scrambling on the last couple holes.  I made some really good pars on 15 and 16, and then, I don't know, I think I struck the ball pretty well today.  I had a lot of putts go in, and I think that kind of builds your confidence.  Just kind of keeps you -- like keeps your head held high.  Yeah, that's how it was today.
Q. What's it mean to you having your mom on the bag?  What kind of different element does that bring?
BAILEY TARDY: She's great.  I just love having her out here.  She knows how to keep me in a positive mood and knows what to take about with me.  I've had club caddies before, and I don't know, sometimes they're in the way and they say things that -- like they don't know will make you angry.  I don't know, my mom is fun.  She just talks about random stuff, and yeah, just kind of keeps my mind off of whether I'm playing good or bad and keeps me in a positive state of mind.
