 Q. Great week. Just a little bit short, but what a way to finish.   
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, it was nice to finish like that. I knew I was probably going to need to make eagle on 18 after seeing Reifers post that 47. I assume he made eagle here, too.  
   
 Q. Yeah. Three eagles on his last six holes.   
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, that will do it. I thought today was my day, to be honest. I played really well. Hit a lot of good putts. Had so many edges and lips it was frustrating.  
Felt like I really played well and I can definitely build on it.
