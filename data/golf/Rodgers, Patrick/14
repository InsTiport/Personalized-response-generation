 Q.  Just kind of talk about how things got going out there this morning.  You had an awesome eagle and then kind of let one slip away there towards the end.  
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah.  I was a little up and down today.  I wasn't my best.  But I feel good with the way I'm striking it.  Just had a mistake on the greens on 4, and a mistake -- one bad iron swing there on 6, but I feel like I'm in good position, leader came back, and should be a fun day tomorrow.   
 Q.  How strange is this you've played in almost every condition imaginable?  Is it hard for guys to know exactly where they stand right now?  
PATRICK RODGERS: Um, no.  I think you've just got to go out and play aggressive, regardless of the wind or the soft conditions.  You know, it's going to be very scorable out there, so I'm trying to make as many birdies as I can and get that number as high as I can on the leaderboard.   
 Q.  Conditions tomorrow, what do you think?  Did it dry out quite a bit?  
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, it was drier than I expected.  I mean, only playing -- I'm in the 8th fairway.  Didn't have a ton of experience out there today, but I expect it to obviously still be wet.  But kudos to the grounds crew.  They've done an amazing job just making us being able to finish this event tomorrow.
