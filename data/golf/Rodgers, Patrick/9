 Q.  Patrick, 65 today.  What was the major difference between Thursday and Friday for you?  
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, I mean, I've been working hard the last month and haven't been seeing a ton of results.  It was nice to put together a controlled round today.  I only had one hiccup there on 13, and made it actually a good bogey after having to drop so far back.   
But, no, I've been rolling the putter well and finally starting to control the ball a little bit better.  So it was nice to see.   
 Q.  Can you describe the conditions that you faced in your early round today?  
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, they were really, really nice.  It rained on my first hole, but other than that, it was great.  The wind started to pick up there in the last six or seven holes, and it look like it might get tougher as the day goes on.   
 Q.  Tied for third last year in the Travelers Championship.  You've got to be excited about the weekend now?  
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, I love this event.  It's my fifth time playing it already, which is crazy.  It feels very, very comfortable, and it's a good golf course for me, so I'm looking forward to playing some good golf over the weekend.
