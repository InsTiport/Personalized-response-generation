Q. Good round today.  Find yourself four shots back of the lead.  How does it feel to be contending right now?
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, it feels great.  It's been a lot of hard work so far and in the off-season and in 2018 and haven't got any reward for it.  But I felt like I'm, I've been really close to playing great golf and it's just nice to see it paying off this week.  I'm starting to get more and more control each day and today was the best round I've played all week.  So hopefully carry that into tomorrow.
Q. This was the best round of the week for you.  What was it specifically that was working well today for you?
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, it was just little trickier with the wind today and then the greens just here are really small and have a ton of slope, so you have to really think well and control your ball and I just did a nice job of that.  I seem to always be in the right spot and didn't really leave myself too many opportunities to make mistakes.  So very clean round and hopefully I can carry that over to tomorrow.
Q. Do you think it gives you a good advantage playing Pebble today, knowing that you're getting another shot at it tomorrow versus somebody who maybe played it Thursday?
PATRICK RODGERS: Yeah, I really liked my draw this week.  Any time you can play Pebble Beach for two consecutive rounds on the weekend, that's a pretty special deal.  And to have it be in a big event like this, it's, it will be a great experience tomorrow.  I'm really looking forward to it.
