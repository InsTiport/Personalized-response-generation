 Q.   How did it go today?  
PATRICK RODGERS:   It's a man's golf course, but I played well.   I felt comfortable with my game.   I just tried to stay really patient.   Played to a lot of the middle of the greens and trusted my putting.   It's really difficult to have good speed, but I've had good speed for the last couple of weeks now and I was trusting my touch out there.   
Besides a couple of mistakes, it was a pretty clean round, so it was good.  
   
 Q.   Have you played here before?  
PATRICK RODGERS:   No, Monday was my first time.   But it's weird.   It's one of those courses like Augusta where I feel like I know every hole and I had never been here.   So I knew how putts break or broke from watching Tiger and some of the other guys play over the years and knew how tee shots shaped and stuff.   So it was cool coming here and playing it.   But, no, this week is my first time.  
   
 Q.   When you came for the Nicklaus Award, did you pop out and watch any golf?  
PATRICK RODGERS:   Yeah, I watched Justin actually play his back nine.   It was really cool for me to see the golf course and see how he played it.   And obviously this is so, so, so, pure.   I couldn't wait to get back here and play.
