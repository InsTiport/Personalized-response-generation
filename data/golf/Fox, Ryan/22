  RYAN FOX: I play on their Tour, technically.Q. (Inaudible.)RYAN FOX: Yeah, it was fantastic.  Definitely a bit nervous early on and actually hit a couple of great shots down the first and made birdie.  Yeah, just really enjoyed it out there, that finish is brutally tough and did well on a couple of holes just to make bogey, really, and really happy with 72 in the end.Q. (Inaudible.)RYAN FOX: Yeah, I mean, the front nine was definitely gettable.  You had a lot of wedges in, and the tee shots aren't too hard with the breeze off the right.  I sort of found as soon as you turn into 14, it turns into out of the left, and it's not a fun tee shot to hit, and basically the last -- four of the last five holes play into out of the left with a bit of trouble on the right.  Sort of try to hang on through there as best you can, and I guess I did that all right today.Q. (Inaudible.)RYAN FOX: Yeah, it was fantastic.  It's The Open at St. Andrews.  It doesn't get any better for a golfer, and obviously I'm ecstatic to have shot 72 first time around.Q. (Inaudible.)RYAN FOX: I was just trying to focus on my next shot, really.  I had a great group to play with, I know Scott Hend fairly well, and Jonathan was a great guy, and we just sort of tried to keep to ourselves a little bit, have a bit of a chat and relax, and as much as possible treat it like any other golf tournament and not treat it like a major.  Yeah, it was good fun.Q. (Inaudible.)RYAN FOX: I haven't seen mom and dad.  I saw them out on the golf course a couple of times, but looking forward to having a chat with them afterwards.Q. (Inaudible.)RYAN FOX: I haven't got that far.  I've got almost 24 hours before I tee off tomorrow.  Probably watch a movie or something tomorrow and try and take my mind off it and hopefully get some good weather tomorrow afternoon.
