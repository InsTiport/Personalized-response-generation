  Q. 5-under 65, pleased with how you started?
 RYAN FOX:   Yeah, definitely.  I left quite a bit out there to be honest.   One on 18, I think I three-putted the fourth for par, as well, and had quite a few chances from three to 15 feet through the middle of the round that I didn't capitalise on.  Tricky enough golf course.  Some of the pins were tucked today and hard to get close to.  Probably one of the best biking rounds I've had and converted a few which was nice.
 Q. How has the just been like back to tournament life?
 RYAN FOX:   Yeah, I mean, I think taking 3 1/2 months off and then trying to come back and play Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, two of our strongest fields of the year, and obviously this week as well, there was a bit of rust there and you kind of fought that in those big weeks.  There was some good signs the last couple of weeks, and you know, it was nice to put it all together today and hopefully it continues for the rest of the week.
 Q. What do you feel like you can particularly build on now for the rest of the tournament?
 RYAN FOX:   I hit it probably the best I've hit it in any round on Tour.  I had a lot of shots close, hit 17 greens, so I can feel confident.  You know, especially in the wind, I think with the wind getting up most afternoons here, I think having strong ball-striking, hopefully that continues through the week and can stay out of trouble for the most part and give myself plenty of birdie opportunities.
