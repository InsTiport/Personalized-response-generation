SHANE WARNE: It was just awesome.  I chipped in a couple of times but it was great fun out there to watch these guys.  It wasn't easy out there in that wind, and to watch Ryan play in that wind was a pleasure.  It was a pleasure to watch him play.   
 Q.  Dovetailed really nicely.  
RYAN FOX: Yeah, we did.  I had five birdies and a bogey, and the hole I bogeyed, he made net birdie anyway.  He played some great golf.  Took advantage of short holes and made a couple of clutch putts and we combined well as a team.   
 Q.  What does it mean to play in this?  
SHANE WARNE: For us hacks, I don't think there's another sport in the world that you can actually play with the pros.  I love any sport -- when an amateur plays at the same time and they are in that mind-set, whether it's cricket or tennis, the pros aren't playing a tournament.  They just muck around and have a hit with you.   
But these guys are playing a serious tournament and it's a great tournament.  It's the best week of the year.  To have that opportunity to watch these guys play, keep out of their way and keep them light-hearted, too.  Try have a bit of fun with the guys, have a love.  I think we gelled really well together.  New Zealand and Aussies, we get along well; and we had a laugh, and I think that probably helps keep these guys nice and relaxed.   
It was great fun.  Had a ball.  It's the best week of the year.  Long may it continue and hopefully we can do the same again tomorrow.   
RYAN FOX: Obviously it's a tough golf course, probably a bit tougher than here, and I'm not sure what the conditions will bring tomorrow but hopefully a little less windy.  As Shane said it was a lot of fun out there today and if we can do the same, doesn't matter what we score, just go out and have fun.
