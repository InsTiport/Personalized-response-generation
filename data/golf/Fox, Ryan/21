Q. Run me through that round.RYAN FOX: That's the best I've driven it all week and I really struggled with the flat stick, missed a few short ones and struggled speed-wise early.  I just had one of those days where I couldn't really get it close to the hole.  I felt like I was hitting good shots and seemed to be half a club out here and there, and there were some tricky pins to get close to, and I always seemed to be on the wrong side of all of them and just dropped some shots early and couldn't get them back.Q. (Inaudible.)RYAN FOX: Yeah, I mean, obviously I've got nothing to lose.  I think I'm pretty close to the back end, if not the back end.  Yeah, I mean, still an awesome experience out there with all the crowds today.  Yeah, looking forward to getting out early tomorrow and hopefully in some good conditions and try to shoot a low number.
