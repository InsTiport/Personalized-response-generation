 Q.  Steady start but you've scored a good one today, 63, you must be happy with that.  
RYAN FOX: Very happy.  Played decent the first couple rounds.  Didn't get much going, energy levels probably down from last week, understandable.  Got a good night's sleep last night and to be fair, today looked nothing different than the first couple days.  Just played the back nine a little better than I had done.   
 Q.  That could be the lowest score on the back nine because the wind seems to have switched.  
RYAN FOX: Yeah, look, the wind makes the last four or five holes a lot easier than they were.  Nothing is really playing into the wind after 11, and that's a brute of a hole, 450 yards into the wind but the rest of the back nine is across and slightly helping, especially 16, 17, 18 are pretty good birdie chances today.   
 Q.  What was the mind-set today knowing you were quite a long way back going into Saturday?  
RYAN FOX: To be honest I wasn't thinking about anything.  Just go out and try and make a score and thankfully I did that pretty well.  It was just nice to see a few putts go in.  I hit good putts earlier in the week that grazed edges, slid by and struggled to read the greens a little bit.  Today, figured them out and nice to see a few go in.   
 Q.  Leaders are just going out now, late start today, but you're at the top of the leaderboard second day running.  
RYAN FOX: Good position to be.  I don't think it will be leading at the end of the day by any means, but certainly have a chance, and that's all you can hope for is a chance going into Sunday.  See what conditions bring tomorrow but always a nice position to be in.
