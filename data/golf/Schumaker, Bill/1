 Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 BILL SCHUMAKER:  Well, it was a little more playable.  The wind started coming up the back nine.  So I think the guys this afternoon will have a stern test again.  But this morning it was very do able. 

 Q.  And you're a PGA professional? 
 BILL SCHUMAKER:  Club pro, yeah. 

 Q.  How does this experience rate for you? 
 BILL SCHUMAKER:  Oh, it's the highlight of my year.  I've been fortunate enough that this is my eight straight year of playing in it.  So I had some success in the Senior Club Pro and I think I made about four cuts in it.  But it's the highlight of my year coming to play with these guys. 

 Q.  If you take away your first round, you would be two over par for -- 
 BILL SCHUMAKER:  Actually, I ended up shooting 3-over today so I would be 3-over.  And to tell you the truth, in the afternoon, that 80 wasn't that bad.  I mean it was, that was just tough.  And again, I'm from Indiana, if we got wind like that, we don't even go outside, let alone play in it. 

 Q.  So you really enjoyed yourself and the experience so far, are you looking forward to tomorrow? 
 BILL SCHUMAKER:  You bet.  Any club pro that's here is enjoying the week.  We don't get to do this very often so it's good stuff.
