Q.   Talk about your round today. 
GREG CHALMERS:   Yeah, I've been driving the ball beautifully all week.   I drove the ball really nicely again today.   First time in my career, the first two days I was No. 1 in driving fairways.   I've never done that before it's a good golf course to do it on.   Today I made some key putts for pars and birdies.   The greens are getting really baked, very firm and very tricky from six and eight feet.

Q.   Are the speeds different?   A lot of 3‑putts that are awkward for touring professionals?
GREG CHALMERS:   I know 8 was ridiculously quick at the back there.   I had 20 feet that I rolled six feet by and Bubba 4‑putted from 30 feet.   It was like glass back there.   There are a couple that are slightly faster than others.   It's just really baked in some areas, and they put the pin there, it's another foot and a half faster yes.

Q.   If you were the public that lived in New York, would you want to play this place on Monday?
GREG CHALMERS:   Yeah, but I love a challenge (chuckling).   I think it would be good for them to see how difficult it is, because this is a great test right now.   The only thing missing from a U.S. Open is about half an inch of rough.   You'd better drive in play or you're in trouble. 

Q.   Pleased with your start for the week?   Good to get off to a good start in these things?
GREG CHALMERS:   Yeah, at this time of the year in the Playoffs, it's about playing well right now.   I'm thrilled with the position I'm in right now and I have to go out and play well tomorrow.   I'm really excited about where things are going at the most.
