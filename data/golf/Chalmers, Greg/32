  Q. Obviously you've gotten to 9 under. In a great position. It's been a long week. But tell me how you're feeling?   
 GREG CHALMERS: I feel great. I've had a pretty relaxing day, really. Sitting around watching TV, bored out of my mind for about eight hours. Then came out and played seven holes, six holes really well, and one hole just average.   
 So I'm really pleased with the position I'm in. Long day tomorrow though. 27 holes or 28 holes or something, so it's going to be a long day.
