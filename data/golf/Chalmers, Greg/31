 Q. Thoughts on the round today?
 GREG CHALMERS: Look, my putter saved me, I think, early on. I 1-putted the first seven greens today. And that really kept me in the round. It certainly saved par I think three or times or more and then birdied four other holes. 
 So when you putt like that, it really does, it gives you a lot of energy about how the day's going to go.

 Q. What happened with the putting? Was it something specific?
 GREG CHALMERS: I was on the putting green this morning and I actually, I overheard one of the other amateurs saying to, their caddie saying to them, you need to get your hands further forward, talking to their player. And I thought, yeah, that's what I'm supposed to do, I forgot about that. I had a long off season and I forgot a couple things. 
 I didn't putt great yesterday, but I put my hand a little further forward today and I rolled the ball perfectly. And the greens are perfect. They really are perfect.

 Q. You go to SilverRock tomorrow, which is supposed to be the toughest course now for the guys this week. 
 GREG CHALMERS: Look, if you play great on any of them you can shoot low scores. There's no question that SilverRock is a lot harder than Nicklaus or even out here, but so at some point you got to play there and I'm playing nicely at the moment, but you got to keep trying to make birdies.

 Q. You know you got to go low here. 
 GREG CHALMERS: Yeah, you do. That's right. It seems to be heading in that direction again this year, so not a lot I can do about it, I just got to keep doing what I'm doing and if the putts go in you shoot low scores. 

 Q. Get your hands down lower. 
 GREG CHALMERS: Yeah.
