Q.   Tell me a little bit about that.   Has it been a little while since you had a two eagle round?
GREG CHALMERS:   I don't think I've done it in years, to be honest.   A two eagle round?   I think this is the week if ever you're going to have an opportunity to make a couple of eagles, in one round, it's certainly on the cards on this golf course.   Just perfect weather today.   It was really great scoring conditions and after I bogeyed the first, I played really nice golf after that.   And really solid most of the day.   And really excited and pleased to get away with an 8‑under par.

Q.   Tell me about the two eagles.   You started on the back, so No. 16 first?
GREG CHALMERS:   No, I started on number 10.   I started on 1, sorry.   I started on 1 and I eagled the 8th hole.   I hit a driver and a 3‑wood to about ‑‑ sorry driver 5‑wood to about 50 feet and made that.   I hit a nice putt on that went in. 
Then I hit a drive and a hybrid into the‑‑ is that what we call them?   Hybrid.   Yeah.   Got to make sure I get my terminology right here.   Yeah, a hybrid into 16 to about six feet.   Be and made that. 
Hit some really nice shots into the par‑5s.   So kind of cool. 

Q.   I know it's only one day and a lot of guys typically go low here, but do you feel pretty good about the position you're in now after the day?
GREG CHALMERS:   It's a great first round, but, look, ultimately, this tournament's going to be won in the mid 20s under par most likely, you got to shoot those kind of rounds.   But you've got to have at least one of them.   So I'm pleased to get that done on the first day and get back at it tomorrow and see what happens.
