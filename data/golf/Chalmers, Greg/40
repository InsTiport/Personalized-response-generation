   GREG CHALMERS:  I putted really nicely today. I would have liked a better opportunity coming down the streatch but I was always three or four behind and trying to push to make birdies. I didn't work out but I shot three under for the back nine and four under today so it was a good day. It wasn't my best week tee to green but I putted well. That's where my score came from. I didn't drive it great and that makes it all the harder. 

 Q.  Reflect on Mark Brown's performance? 
 GREG CHALMERS:  That is amazing. Just to win once, but to win twice in a row is a great achievement. I have won myself and it takes so much out of you to win and he is obviously riding a very nice wave at the moment so good luck to him. 

 Q.  For a guy who gave up the game for three years this performance is phenomenal? 
 GREG CHALMERS:  This game beats you around the head sometimes and it did for him so this is a great story to win two weeks in a row and he is now exempt in Europe, Asia, Australia, all over the place. It's a great story.
