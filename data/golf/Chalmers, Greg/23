  GREG CHALMERS:   The greens are perfect.   I'm pleased with 2‑under right now.   Probably could have driven the ball a little better.

Q.   You've come in under par, you're in a good spot.   Obviously could be a lot worse off the last day.   You have to take confidence out of there. 
GREG CHALMERS:   Oh, yeah, no question, I felt really confident this morning.   When I was 4‑under I just hit a couple of loose tee shots and it cost me.   It's just not that hard to make bogeys out here when you get a little out of place.   I was pleased to play the back nine and would have loved to have parred the last hole to have a 1‑under on the back nine, but a few guys have bogeyed that last hole today. 
I played okay on the back nine, played pretty nice, and got it to even par and 2‑under for the day. 

Q.   Conditions obviously this morning were a little more benign, more than people were expecting.   Was it good that you got out in that? 
GREG CHALMERS:   On this golf course it can blow.   It's not going to blow hard today, but it can blow 25, so that makes it very interesting.   But I was pleased that we didn't have to deal with much of that.   It was only slight, maybe 2 mile an hour breeze from the opposite direction in fact from when I played the practice round.   That was probably the hardest thing for me, just adjusting from the practice round.
