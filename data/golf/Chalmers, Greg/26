 Q. Talk about how you played 16. 
 GREG CHALMERS: Well, for me it suits me. I move the ball left to right. The pin was short right. I put a 9-iron off my back foot, was a little bit into the wind. Hole-in-ones quite often are surprising, and that one surprised me because it didn't look from where I was standing that it was far enough up to go in. I thought it was going to be four or five feet short. It was a surprise. 

 Q. Yesterday was it a little easier to be aggressive this hole with the pin location?
 GREG CHALMERS: Oh, absolutely, you can go at that flag. Even yesterday you could get close to that one, too. The back left flag there and the top right flag are the two hardest ones. But yesterday, same deal, you had the little tier on the right of the hole so you could get it down close. But two hole-in-ones this morning, Snedeker had one, as well, so it's accessible, there's no question.

 Q. How did you find out that Snedeker had one, too? 
 GREG CHALMERS: Only when I got on 18 I saw his eagle on the scoreboard. Yeah, somebody said it was the second hole-in-one, but I didn't know who. 

 Q. He joked about not even winning a skin there. 
 GREG CHALMERS: Well, I'm sure he'll survive when he's one shot behind on the lead. I'm not worried about it.
