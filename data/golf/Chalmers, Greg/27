   GREG CHALMERS: You really have to driver in it play. I did that, only missed two fairways today by my count. When you do that you get in trouble as I made my first bogey. There are some opportunities if you drive in it play. I think you'll see some low scores from the guys back there get going.  
  
  Q. Did you kind of lay it up a little bit on 18 hoping to --  
 GREG CHALMERS: I was trying to lay it up short of the bunkers. I got a flyer. I wasn't anticipating hitting an 8-iron as far as I did.   
 I was just trying to get it over the creek. Left me an impossible position. Five was a good score for me. I'm pleased with the day. I really played nicely.  
  
  Q. Weather is kind of cooperating a little bit.  
 GREG CHALMERS: Yeah. I think it helps the way we set the golf course up. I think the people can get the greens a little firmer. They're not exactly mush like they normally are here. There's been some whispers about bermuda for next year. That would make the golf course extremely difficult, I think. You can make it firmer. Certainly it's much more pleasant to be 10 to 15 degrees cooler than what we normally are.  
  
  Q. You're 4-under. Not a bad start. What do you have to do with your game to pick up a few more strokes?  
 GREG CHALMERS: Usually it comes down to driving and playing, putting. I probably missed a couple putts today that could have gone in that makes a difference between a 7-under round and 4-under round. I'm pleased. If I shot four 4-unders I wouldn't be far away from something exciting. It's a good start for me. I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.
