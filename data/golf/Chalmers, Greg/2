Q. Greg, a great finish to the round, always great to finish with a birdie?
GREG CHALMERS: Yeah, no question.  I had a scratchy day there early on.  I think my first time as a featured pairing, you know, so I had a lot of cool stuff going on recently.  I played a little scratchy on that first nine, the back nine.
Then I made a nice putt for par to stay even par on the fourth, the par 3.  And then birdied the next, birdied the next and then picked up one there at 9.  Nice to finish with three on the last six.
Q. No. 8 was a great par.  That bunker shot was beautiful?
GREG CHALMERS: No question, I got lucky.  It was sitting nicely.  It's a nasty little -- if you can't get spin on that ball, it can roll off the other side of that green.  That green is probably the hardest green on the golf course now.  If you look what Kuch did, he hit a nice, soft shot in there and it ran through.  Probably ran forward 15 yards.
Yeah, it's nice to get out of that one with four.  It's a narrow little target coming in there.
Q. What's going to change for you since winning?  You mentioned already being in a featured group.
GREG CHALMERS: Yeah, look, the dust will settle on all these things.  I have to keep playing good golf to get the perks that you get from doing that.
Look, nothing much has changed.  I've just been really happen and I really pleased with the response I've got from my friends and my peers.  A lot of people are genuinely pleased for me and been very kind.
Q. You're still in a battle for the FedExCup points?
GREG CHALMERS: No question, I think I'm 140th.  But I've got nothing but upside.  I get in the Playoffs, that's great.  That was a lot better than where I was a month ago.
It's exciting, if I can get that done, great.  If not, I'll have a little time off and get ready for next season.
