   GREG CHALMERS:  I found without the wind, once in play there is a score to be made. You don't have to strike it awesome to shoot a score as I showed today. But you see the low scores today it is doable. I would like to hit it better but four under on a day like today is not too bad and I am only two off the lead with a round to go and get it tomorrow.   
 I have played nicely for a while now. I finished last year with three top tens in a row and started this year with two top tens so my game  has been in good shape for the six months.   
  
  Q.  It is nice to see you playing a European Tour event again?   
 GREG CHALMERS: I have been playing in America working on my US accent which is not going too well! I am on the Nationwide tour this year and I am keen to get my US Tour card but if something happened tomorrow and a win popped up I would take up my status and return to Europe. I am from Australia so never at home anyway and I am about making a living. I enjoyed playing Europe and enjoyed the States and if an opportunity came my way I would grab it with both hands.   
  
  Q.  Back in the 1990s you finished second in the Spanish Open and English Open, just outside the top 20 in the Order of Merit - do you look back at those days?   
 GREG CHALMERS:  I enjoy keeping up with the results of my fellow countrymen over there and had a good chat with Richard Finch today about some of the guys over there - Ian Garbutt and Michael Welch. I was wondering what they were up to.   
  
  Q.  And the Johnnie Walker Classic is one you have played a few times?   
 GREG CHALMERS:  I know the uniqueness of the event and how special it is in the grand scheme of the game. It would be something else to bring it home if it happened. It is going to come down to how well you putt. If the ball rolls nicely you are going to have chances.
