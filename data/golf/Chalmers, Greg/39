 Q. 2-under.
 GREG CHALMERS: I doubled my second hole, par 3 on 11 into the water in the back, and then made four birdies. Pretty solid after that. I holed a couple of nice putts to keep the round going. 
 I hope -- two putts on the first nine from 15 feet for par. That kind of gets the momentum going and made some nice birdies on the front-9. I'm really pleased with 2-over after two holes and shoot 2-under on this course is a good effort.

 Q. Anything about the conditions, did they change at all during the round?
 GREG CHALMERS: Not really. It's a lot softer than I would have expected it to be. It really did soften it out. We're spinning a lot of shots back. That made it -- didn't make it -- you just had to judge your spin, basically. I spun a couple uphill on a couple holes, which is surprising. Really, the golf course is as good as it's going to play. If you want to shoot a score, today is the day to do it.
