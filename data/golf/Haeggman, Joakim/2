JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   Obviously very happy     played some holes today in the rain and wind.  Three or four shots out, there I am again, the same as last week.  Just really happy to play well and finish     seeing as they are already done.  Didn't really look at the leaderboard the whole day.  Just after I holed that last, I looked at the board and said, well done, you can't say much.
Q.  Did you have in mind what you were aiming for?
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   Not really just trying to plug along as well as I can.  You really don't know what's going to happen.  It's going to be tough out there a day like today.  It's just going to be tough out there.  They obviously played well in the last group today.  Hats off to them.
Q.  Are you surprised you found yourself two or three shots behind?
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   16, I thought I would be a little closer than two behind, but again, it was a good week and keep plugging.
Q.  Another good week for you, ever since you won in Qatar, you've been around every week?
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   Yeah, it's been very good this year, very, very interesting season, it's nice stuff.
Q.  Must be great after the injuries of last year to be playing so well?
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   Yeah, it's just fantastic to be back.
