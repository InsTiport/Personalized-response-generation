GORDON SIMPSON:  Your reflections on the day.
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   I actually think  -- well, yesterday I played really well, for actually about 10 or 12 holes, but today was probably the best from tee-to-green all day around.  It was really tricky in the wind on the back side here.  I kept hitting it straight  -- from 13, 14, 15, couldn't get it close and on 17, I drove it perfect down the middle of the fairway.

It was a lit bit frustrating not to get a score on that stage.  He'll really happy to squeeze a birdie on the last hole where I sort of hooked the tee ball into the left-hand fairway trap, so in the end, happy to get away with 2-under.  Could have been a lot better, but steady golf, happy about that.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Fantastic leaderboard looking into the last day.
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   Yeah, I make all the difference, don't I?  (Laughing).

It's absolutely great.  It's nice to be involved in it and have a chance to perform well with these guys.  It's really nice.
GORDON SIMPSON:  It's been a good season all around, you won Qatar, and last week you were close.
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   Yeah, it's been a very steady season, quite a few Top 10's and winning Qatar.  Considering I was on the crutches trying to get the pins out in October, it has really been a change.  It's amazing really.
Q.  Do you get more excited as the Ryder Cup becomes more of a possibility?
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   It is getting very excited.  This is an opportunity that you could not dream of over Christmas.  Having said that, Ryder Cup seems a long way away, especially if I don't get in the NEC and U.S. PGA at end of the race.  Having said that, I'm going to get plenty of chances in the summer and tomorrow is a great chance.
Q.  Were you at The Belfry last time?
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:  I was in The Belfry helping.  I was Torrance's assistant captain at The Belfry.
Q.  It would mean more to be there again as a player?
JOAKIM HAEGGMAN:   Absolutely.  It's been a good 11 years since I've played.  It would be great to get back.  I played in the '93 team.
