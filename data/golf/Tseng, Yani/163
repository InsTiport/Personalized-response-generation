 And No. 18, I had a 9-iron for second shot, 24 feet. 
 COLIN CALLANDER: You've already won a major this year, so you must be very pleased with the way the season has gone this far.
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I'm not surprised and I feel a lot of confidence. I know that I can do it and just every week, I know what I'm going to do and I know I can be at the top of the leaderboard. 
 COLIN CALLANDER: What do you think of Sunningdale here this week? 
 YANI TSENG: It's a great course and it's in great shape. It's a very, very hard course for us and it's a great course and I would be happy to come back. 

 Q. Why are you playing so well this year? What is it about your game this year that you're playing very well?
 YANI TSENG: I think I just got a good team and I've worked hard, and every week I try to learn something for every week, so I think I've got a lot of experience from playing the LPGA Tour. 

 Q. How many hours a day would you say you work on your game? 
 YANI TSENG: Sometimes I play nine holes and 18 holes and I will be like two or three hours on my short game and one hour for my long game, so it quite a long day. 
 COLIN CALLANDER: You said you tried to learn something every week. Have you learned something this week? 
 YANI TSENG: This week, I really just do my best, and just head up and walking with confidence. I don't want to be walking with my head down and feeling sad. Just have every chance for me to make something good happen. 

 Q. Did you think you could catch the leader today or was she always just a little too far ahead?
 YANI TSENG: Before I was thinking I could catch the leader, but after the 18th hole, I saw the leaderboard, 18- or 19-under, so I do my best, I don't know. 
 COLIN CALLANDER: Thank you very much.
