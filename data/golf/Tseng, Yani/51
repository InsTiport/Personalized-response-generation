  YANI TSENG:   On 3, that is the only best shot I hit today, and I didn't make any birdies today.   I probably left them yesterday.   I think three‑putt on number 10, I should have made birdie there, because the second shot was only rescue.   So that was disappointing.   
I didn't play terrible today.   I just did one double.   If I'm not in the water and I finish one over, I'm still in pretty good position.   But with 3‑under, I still have two more days to go and hopefully next two days I can fight back a little bit.  
   
 Q.   In terms of birdies on 15, both your playing partners had a birdie and it's like it's my turn now.   You just couldn't get them, right?   
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I couldn't hit them much closer.   I tried to hit them in closer and make a putt.   But I was seeing both of them making birdie, and I was like come on, when is my turn?   But I just told them you didn't leave any birdies for me today, but yesterday I left some for you guys.
