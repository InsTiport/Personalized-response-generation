 Q. You said that was your first eagle on the LPGA Tour. How did that feel?
 YANI TSENG: Very exciting. I see the ball to make that putt. I'm so happy I jump up. I don't know, I was like -- when I backswing I was stuck, I don't know why. I just feel, I don't know how the downswing. Me and caddie, we were laughing because I didn't know how I hit it. But we had a lot of fun on the last three holes.

 Q. You're having a great rookie season, so how does it feel to only be eight events into the year and to have all these Top 10 finishes?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I feel I'm learning a lot from a lot of good players and I really enjoy to be in this group.

 Q. There's 54 holes left of play, so what's your plan for tomorrow to stay on top of that leaderboard?
 YANI TSENG: I think just don't try too hard, just play one shot at a time. My coach always told me good putter, they always think just hit a good stroke, so I just keep a good stroke, and straight in.
