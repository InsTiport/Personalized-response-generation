Q.   What do you think about Lydia Ko?   She's at 12â€‘under now. 
YANI TSENG:   It's very impressed.   Especially she's only 15 years old.   I didn't even know what I'm doing when I'm 15.   So it's pretty amazing to see her play this good in the best stage.   All the best coverage here and she's like only 15 years old and trying to win an LPGA tournament.   It must be a dream come true if she can win. 
So I mean it's good to see so many younger players now on the tour, and it's good to see the young generations coming out.

Q.   Do you think it's good for the game to see something like that happen?
YANI TSENG:   I think it's good for the game.   Yeah, I feel I'm old on the tour now.   I'm only 23, but there's so many younger players now.
