   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yani, thanks for coming in and joining us today. Another great round for a 2008 Tour rookie. Two second place finishes already this year, and it looks like you're already on your way to another big finish here at the Stanford International Pro-Am. Talk about your round.
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I played really consistent today. Yeah, I just make -- I was be patient and keep it up every holes. But on 16 I put it in the water. It's kind of like sad, but still pretty good round today.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Definitely. Well, let's go over your scorecard. Tell me about the bogey on the 2nd hole.
 YANI TSENG: The second hole, I hit rescue and I push to the right and I miss six-feet putt, or five-feet putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Two-putt from five feet? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, two-putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How about the birdie on 5.
 YANI TSENG: Nine feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What club? 
 YANI TSENG: 58.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: 58 to nine feet? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: The birdie on 7.
 YANI TSENG: 58 and 24 feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Nice putt. All right. How about the birdie on 9. 
 YANI TSENG: 17 feet and pitching wedge on second shot.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 11.
 YANI TSENG: 11 is 9-iron and 15 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. And the double bogey on 16. Tell us what club you started with and how it happened. 
 YANI TSENG: I hit a driver to the bunker and it was about 90 yards to the pin. And then I hit (indiscernible) the bunker into the water. I chipped from 60 yards and misread the putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: So your second shot went into the water? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, second shot went into the water. I was like, crap.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What about after that? What was your third shot? 
 YANI TSENG: My third shot I dropped 60 yards and I have good shot there, but I misread my putt. It was like five feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What club did you use from 60 yards? 
 YANI TSENG: 58. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: To 6 feet. 
 YANI TSENG: And I misread the putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Two-putt. But you finished up with a birdie on 18. How did that happen? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I was thinking I want to make eagle. The second shot is only 6-iron for me. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: 6-iron to how close? 
 YANI TSENG: Over -- I just pass the pin over the hill and it's very far, like 40 feet from the hole, 30 feet from that one.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And that's where you two-putted from, 30 feet? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I hit a good shot on the second one. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: She likes her Par 5s, if you guys can't tell. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah.

 Q. (No microphone.)
ASHLEY CUSHMAN: There was no eagle. We're going to have a couple little scoring glitches this week just because some of the admin computers can only read off of the par from one course. Since we're playing on two -- if a player is on the Soffer course the scoring is going to be okay.
 If we're playing on the Miller course, we might have a few discrepancies, such as Yani's eagle. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. Everybody say, Oh, congratulations. You make an eagle. I say, What? I make a double on 16, not eagle. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yani played on the Miller court today. Questions? Just use the microphone, please. 

 Q. Last weekend at the Ginn you said that you learned a lot from playing with Lorena about how to keep your temperament more even. Do you think that's going to help you this week and throughout the rest of the year? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. And I feel very confident and I feel very comfortable here. Like when I make every swing and every putt I still feel -- I'm very enjoy and I going to be like top 10 or top 5.
 So I can feel that I'm very confidence for that. Yeah. 

 Q. You said last week that your goal this year was to win rookie of the year. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah.

 Q. Doesn't look as if at this point you're going to have trouble with that if you keep playing the way you are. Is that the attitude you have. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, that's the attitude. 

 Q. Usually it takes even good players time to get adjusted to everything. This is what, your sixth event on this tour?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, this is my seventh. 

 Q. How have you been able to make the adjustment so quickly?
 YANI TSENG: Oh, because I think I have a good coach, I have good friends, good manager. They just give me -- telling me what's wrong and what's -- I making right decision or wrong decision. 
 And they told me, Everything you worry about in the world never did any -- happen any good. So that's good for me. So I say, Okay, I don't want worry every day. I just can play my golf. 
 And, yeah, that's make me feel really relax. I think that's the key. Really enjoying the course, so...

 Q. The rounds have been extremely slow today, mostly because of the wind. Is that difficult?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. It's very difficult. It's like three hours for nine holes and then we got to have -- so my coach bring a lunch box for me after nine holes. 
 So you need to be very patient on this course. So it's kind of first couple holes I play too quick because we waiting for a long time. When I stand there I just hit it. So I kind of need to be very patient on this tournament.

 Q. Is this your first Pro-Am experience as far as this type of format? If so, did you spend a lot of time talking to your amateur players today?
 YANI TSENG: Oh, not really. I kind of like -- they're very nice. But after second hole I made bogey. My partner is, Oh, you need to make that putt. Oh, okay. I will. So it's very funny. 
 I think we have a very good talk. Kind of like they want talk to you every hole, so it's really good. Yeah. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: 2-Under, 68. What was the team score, Yani, do you know? 
 YANI TSENG: I don't know. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: We'll have to look. We'll look on the leaderboard back here. 

 Q. Who is your coach and has he been you on tour all season?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. He's here. He was in Ginn Open last week. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What's his name? 
 YANI TSENG: Glen Daugherty. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Can you spell the last name.
 YANI TSENG: I don't know how to spell it.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: D-a-u-g-h-e-r-t-y. 
 YANI TSENG: And my short game coach is in California, Dave Stockton. 

 Q. What was the box lunch that he brought out for you?
 YANI TSENG: Chocolate cookie and some hamburger. I just ate a little bit because I'm not get used to eat a hamburger in the course. Two chocolate cookies. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Good luck this weekend, Yani. Thanks for coming in.
