Q.   Were you practicing for anything specific? 
YANI TSENG:   No, not really.   Just on my mental game a little bit.   I just needed to picture the shot before I hit it.   My swing is getting more consistent, so there is nothing to work on, just mostly tempo.

Q.   I watched a lot of really good shots.   Was there anything positive you wanted to take away from today? 
YANI TSENG:   Just accept that one shot costs three more shots, but everything else is fine.   That's just one shot I didn't pick the target. 
But this is golf.   I know it's just a fine line.   It could be 4‑under, it could be 3‑over.   Hopefully, I get to play tomorrow.   I know I can make a bunch of birdies out there and still stay positive.   Today is the past, and I'll learn from today, and I won't make the same mistakes tomorrow.

Q.   What happened on 7?   Just take me through it. 
YANI TSENG:   On the shot, I was hitting driver, but today because of the downwind I chose the 3‑wood, and I didn't pick the shot I wanted to hit.   And I didn't like the target I picked, and I just kind of pulled to the left.   It was this much out of bounds.   So it's very unlucky.   And I didn't make it up‑and‑down from the front of the green, so it cost me 7 there.

Q.   Gary gave you a little pep talk?   Did he give you good feedback, some positive reinforcement? 
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, he always stays very positive.   He trusts me that I can do this.   So he told me it's just a fine line.   I can be really good and it's just the momentum.

Q.   He called you my champion? 
YANI TSENG:   Yeah.
