Q.   So 4â€‘under par.   Leader's at 7.   You're in the hunt.   How do you feel going into the weekend?
YANI TSENG:   I feel pretty good.   I hit the shots well, and I know this is course, sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't because when you hit good shot, you might bounce into the rough.   But you just need to be patient on this course, and I think I did for those two days, and I just need to make some more putts, you know. 
I felt good out there and looking forward for next two days.

Q.   A lot of people like to talk about the state of your game and whether you're be No. 1 again.   Do you worry about any of that when you're out there or are you just out there having fun?
YANI TSENG:   No.   I'm just out there having fun.   I'm worrying too much last two years, so I'm not worrying anything about No. 1 or anything about ranking.   Now I just want to win a tournament.   Winning a tournament, if I'm No. 1 is good.   If not I'm still happy.   I think the ranking is just a bonus if you're winning.   So just try to go out there and try to win a tournament is the most important thing for me now.
