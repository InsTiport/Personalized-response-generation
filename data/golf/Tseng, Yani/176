  Q.  A good round.  Are you happy?   
 YA-NI TSENG:  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Very good actually.  I just didn't thinking too much, I just go and play.  I don't have a lot of expectations.  This made me more relaxed.   
  
  Q.  That was going to be my next question.  This is your first LPGA event?   
 YA-NI TSENG:  Yeah, this year.   
  
  Q.  Last year you played?   
 YA-NI TSENG:  2003, yeah.

 YA-NI TSENG:  That's right.   
  
  Q.  A little bad luck on 18?   
 YA-NI TSENG:  Yeah, the green was moving, I just make a mistake.   
  
  Q.  Even then it hit but it just --   
 YA-NI TSENG:  Yeah, a little bit on the last hole.   
  
  Q.  It was a good bunker shot?   
 YA-NI TSENG:  Yeah.  The green is very tricky, so I misread a lot the greens.   
  
  Q.  The greens all around?   
 YA-NI TSENG:  Yeah, very tricky.   
  
  Q.  How many birdies today?   
 YA-NI TSENG:  Five birdies.

  Q.  They were all short?   
 YA-NI TSENG:  Yeah, they were missed, and I missed two short putts, three short putts.   
  
  Q.  Like within five, six feet?
