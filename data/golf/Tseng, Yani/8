 Q.  First, how special is it for you always coming back and playing in Taiwan at LPGA?  
YANI TSENG: I mean, for this year especially I feel very different.  I just feel very happy to be here because I really had tough years on the LPGA Tour.   
Feels like finally back to the where you feel familiar, and to see the fans, media, family, and friends out here, just feels like you're not alone.  You know, just feels great to be back in Taiwan.   
I don't have any expectations here.  I just want to do my best and put on the great show for the fans.   
 Q.  You made a coaching change recently.  
YANI TSENG: Yes.   
 Q.  And then you had your best result of the season last week.  Do you feel like you found something?  
YANI TSENG: Yeah, I think I found something, some little tricks here and there.  I mean, for sure Gary helps me like for my swing a little bit.  I been knowing Gary for so long and I think he really helps me on the mental side too because he know what I have been struggling.  He know why I play so well and why I'm struggling.  So we kind of share a little bit the experience on that.   
For me, I think the reason why my score is better too is because I think my mind is much more calm than before.  Like step on the tee I wasn't thinking about mistake.  I just try to say whatever happens and not think about too much.   
 Q.  Is that something that's been recent for you?  This year?  
YANI TSENG: Yeah.  I think that's something this year that I step on the tee and like I'm thinking so much things that it feels like so dramatic for me in my mind.  It can come for like one second and can lose my mind.   
So like if my mind can be much quieter I think it's going to help me a lot.
