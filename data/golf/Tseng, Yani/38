Q.   Tell me about the day.   Obviously I'm sure you had a lower number in mind. 
YANI TSENG:   Yeah.   I thought I could play a little better because I missed a few short putts out there.   But everything was okay.   I can hit shots better, but it's only the first day and I've been really patient today, even though I didn't make any birdies on the back nine, but I stayed patient.   There's three more days to come, and I know I can shoot a low score here. 

Q.   Were you surprised that the scores weren't lower from the morning groups, given it was really calm?
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I think because in the afternoon we just pick up much more.   But in the morning I think the greens was softer, too, because when we played the back nine the greens were kind of very firm. 
But I mean, I was surprised that the scores didn't go very well.   So I'm even, I'm still not bad.   So tomorrow if you shoot 4‑, 5‑under you're back in good position again.

Q.   When you're out here working, what are you working on, you and Gary?
YANI TSENG:   Nothing.

Q.   It's a secret? 
YANI TSENG:   No.   I mean, while I'm here I just relax.   I putt better.   Probably sometimes I pick a little bit and I want to see the result.

Q.   Pick your head up?
YANI TSENG:   Yeah.   But everything else I want to feel the same when I play on the putting green and when I play on the course, should be the same feel, but when I go out to the course I just try too hard to make it.
