Q.   How are you feeling?
YANI TSENG:   Feels pretty good.   I mean, today was tougher than yesterday, and I had a couple wrong decisions on the front nine, so made a couple bogeys there.   And I had two threeâ€‘putts.   Greens were very tricky today, but I hung in there and I finished strong, last five I had three birdies.   So always very happy to get a finish like that on 18 and enjoy the crowd.   I think it's very important, kind of make your day.   Then you can go back home and be a happy person and have a good sleep and come out tomorrow with smiles.   I'm very looking forward to tomorrow and just want to relax and have the same strategy as today.

Q.   How long was your putt on 18?
YANI TSENG:   Three feet.

Q.   Short?
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, short.   I go for it.

Q.   What's the plan tomorrow, being aggressive, anything you want to change or keep the same?
YANI TSENG:   No, I mean, just keep the same as today, just try to make good decisions on it and commit to every shot and just enjoy tomorrow.

Q.   Do you feel more comfortable being at the top of the leaderboard?
YANI TSENG:   I mean, I always feel comfortable wherever I am.   I just really enjoy every moment here and be the happiest person I can and have more fun playing on the golf course. 

Q.   What would it mean to get your win in a little while here?
YANI TSENG:   I wouldn't think that much.   Maybe ask me tomorrow and I'll let you know.
