Q. 5-under.  Pretty strong today, but nobody was catching Korda if she played like that, huh?
YANI TSENG: No, I'm 4 shot back and I feel like I need to make some birdies on the first few holes.
I did pretty well on the front nine; kind of cooled down little bit on the back nine.  I didn't hit as good drive like last few days.  If you don't hit on the fairway on this course kind of hard to make birdies.
But I make two incredible putts to save par.  I mean, it was good 35- or 40-feet putt to save par, especially on No. 16 I hit out of bounds on my tee shot and save par.
I just never give up and never give any shots out there.  Just very happy the way I finish, the way I handle in the round today.  Even I didn't drive as good as like last few days.
Q. I was going to say, top 5 to start the Asian swing is heck of start, right?
YANI TSENG: It's pretty good.  I'm going to play all five tournaments, so I'm very exciting, very looking forward for next five tournaments.  I'm here to win.  I want to win a tournament so bad.
I know I have to enjoy myself so I have more chance to win.  This week I'm enjoy myself and I always learn something from it.
Q. Seems like you're having more fun out there, too; is that accurate?
YANI TSENG: I am.  I think all the hard work is pay off.  Very happy with my coach, my trainer, my mental coach.  They have been helping me a lot to get here.
Q. Another week in contention.  Got to feel pretty good about that.  Another positive step forward.
YANI TSENG: Yeah, always happy to see my name on the first page of the leaderboard.  I miss that nerves and that pressure on the last few holes.  I just can't wait to win another one again.
