 Q.   Talk us through your round today.   
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I played good, but I missed bunch of putts out there.   
I was just actually a little nervous out there when I putting.   I don't know, just maybe thinking a little more on my putting than others.  
But I got some lucky bounce and make birdie on the last hole so I was very happy.   Just fricking nervous out there.   I think just at least I back into the circle.   Hopefully take into next week.  
   
 Q.   So next week you're ready you think?  
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I'm ready.   I hit shot good, but just need work on the trusting and come into the shot.  
But it's a good week.   Looking forward to come back here for sure.
