 Q.   So tough day out there.   You were in the hunt early in the day; didn't work out for you.   Just talk about how you played.   
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I didn't play well today.   I didn't give myself lots of chance to make birdie.   I had lots of chance to make par.   
Just not my day out there.   I don't know what's happen.   My distance was way off today.   10, 20 yards too far or 20 yards too short.   Just never get close to the pins.  
So I try my best, and just hopefully come back next year or looking forward play next tournament.  
   
 Q.   Did the wind really affect the distance, do you think, or was it you?   
YANI TSENG:   I think both, but I feel the wind we just probably didn't good as good yardage and the way we want to hit it.  
So both me and my caddie, we have lots of (indiscernible.)  
   
 Q.   Last one:   Overall this week, probably another top 10 finish, you're still playing well.   What do you take away from this week?  
YANI TSENG:   (Indiscernible)   I mean, everybody's enjoy out here, so I mean, I am looking forward to come back next year to fight it back and play well again next year.  
It was a great tournament.   We're all enjoy here, and very happy that the tournament is back here again.   Sometimes the wind just didn't goes‑‑ you're not going to be perfect every time.   
But like you said, hopefully I can still finish on top 10.
