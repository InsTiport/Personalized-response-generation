  YANI TSENG: I finished pretty bad I think, No. 9, 10, feel very disappointed, especially No. 9, that was an easy birdie for everybody and just I hit it into the water. 
 Then Chie played very well today, I saw 10-under on the leaderboard. But still have two day to go and I will do my best, try my best.

 Q. And what will you do to get back on track?
 YANI TSENG: I finished birdie and very happy, so not so bad. Still Top-10 so looking forward for the next two days.
