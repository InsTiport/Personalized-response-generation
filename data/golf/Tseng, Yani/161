   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: You're tied for second.   
 YANI TSENG: Really? I didn't know that. That's awesome. Actually today I feel a lot of different because I -- my tempo on first couple holes didn't feel ready.   
 And then I had a (indiscernible) on 14, but I was sitting down and I was just be patient and the tempo.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Absolutely.  
  
  Q. You were 6-under par when the play stopped yesterday. Did you find it difficult to get going again? Is that what you're talking about with the tempo?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I just try to think in the good way, because I know I play very well but we stop because of rain. So I just trying to thinking a lot of positive things, so I did.  
  
  Q. Was it tough to get back into it?  
 YANI TSENG: No, I don't think so. Just the tempo is like I say just a little bad.   
  
  Q. A bug in your throat?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I just keep drink water and the bug is coming out.  
  
  Q. What kind of a bug, like a fly?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, like this big.   
  
  Q. When was that?   
 YANI TSENG: On No. 12. After I made bogey I couldn't concentrate because I feel so bad because of the bug. So I just tell myself maybe that's lucky, that's a lucky for me.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: It's your protein.  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. And I have just saw Harry (ph) and I say, Do you know what kind of protein this is? Is it chocolate protein?   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: You're too funny.   
  
  Q. And how long did it stay with you?   
 YANI TSENG: The hole, one hole. But now still feel a little bit maybe something.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: This year you've been paired with some the best players of women's golf Annika Sorenstam, Lorena Ochoa, and you're just a rookie. Do you feel like you're not as nervous when you're grouped with someone like Annika anymore?   
 YANI TSENG: No, not anymore. First couple times, but not anymore. We're the same, so I just figured it out and work hard.
