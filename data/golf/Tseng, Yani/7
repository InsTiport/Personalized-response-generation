Q. Let's talk about the albatross.  What was that experience like?
YANI TSENG: First time.  And actually, I see it going in, and everybody was cheering really loud.  Yeah, first time.  I had 188 to the pin, downwind.  I hit 7-iron and it landed perfect and just see it go in, pretty cool.
Q. What was that experience like?  What was the celebration like when you saw the ball go in for an albatross?
YANI TSENG: I don't know, I was just high-fiving everybody, to the fans.  I was two-hands-up.  I don't know, it was pretty cool.  I just tried to calm down after that.
Q. How tough is that?  Obviously that's such a huge shot.
YANI TSENG: Yeah, it is.  You're actually afraid to make some more mistakes after that.  But I made birdie the next hole, so that was pretty cool.
