  YANI TSENG:   I was really close today.   I tried my best, but I didn't give up any shots.   I played my best.   I fight my best to get all the way back. 
And I think I just needed a little bit more luck to win in this tournament because I had a bad break on the Back 9, but I'm just hoping next year it will be better.

Q.   Was it No. 10 that killed you, the double bogey there?
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, a little bit.   I think I just got a little bad luck there.   It wasn't hit that bad, but just didn't get a good bounce, and I make more birdie on 11 hole, but on the back I didn't get any birdies.   Kind of upset.   Just very close to the hole, but didn't make any.

Q.   What about 2012?   You've already won one tournament.   What are your aims and goals for the rest of the year?
YANI TSENG:   I don't know.   Just keep winning because I feel good right now.   I feel lots of confidence, and I feel my game is A game now, and just I think I need to get more consistent because I think I work really hard off season.   I do my physical and my swing change a little bit, and this goes as far as normal, so I just need to get my distance around to see how far and how consistent I can get.

Q.   For some reason you can't win here in Singapore.   What is it about this place, and is it a bitter disappointment given the fact that there were so many Asian fans here to support you?
YANI TSENG:   Yeah.   I do feel disappointed because I didn't win this tournament.   I was very close this year.   I played great front nine, but hopefully next year I won't be disappointed.   I will do my best and just keep working hard.
