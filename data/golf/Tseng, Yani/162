   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yani, thanks for coming in and joining us today. You had to finish your morning round, the second round today, and turned around and played another 18 holes and built a four-stroke lead and set the course record both in the same day. How are you feeling right now? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I feel great, but I feel so tired being out here so long day. I got a little bit headache, so I just try to concentrate every shot and play my own game.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Let's do your scorecard really quick and then we'll do questions. Bogey on 1. I know you've had a lot of shots today.
 YANI TSENG: I push my 3-wood and I pull my second 6-iron and then chip out for six feet and I missed.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 4. 
 YANI TSENG: Birdie on 4, I had 5-wood on tee off and second shot 7-iron and putt like three feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 5.
 YANI TSENG: I had a 3-putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far? 
 YANI TSENG: Maybe 15 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 6, par 5. It's okay. You had a long day. 560 yards. It's the longest hole on the course.
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I had I think 16 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What was your approach club? 
 YANI TSENG: 9-iron. That was a very good hole. Very long.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yes. Birdie on 7, Par 4. 
 YANI TSENG: Birdie on 7? 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Uh-huh, that's what I have. 
 YANI TSENG: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I hit a 52 for second shot and like 20 feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Nice putt. 
 YANI TSENG: Thank you. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 9, another Par 5. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I go for second shot and just 3-wood and chipped out, made like 15 feet putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Chip to 10? 
 YANI TSENG: I didn't chip well today.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 12.
 YANI TSENG: I had 20 feet straight uphill, and I leave short three feet and 3-putt. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 13. 
 YANI TSENG: Second shot pitching wedge. How long? I say 15 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. Birdie on 13. 
 YANI TSENG: 9-iron for second shot and 17 feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And the last one, 17 birdie, Par 3. 
 YANI TSENG: 8-iron, four feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. And the last question from me. You're just a rookie, and you won a major already for your first LPGA Tour win. Did you think your season was going to be this good? You have so many second place finishes, too. 
 YANI TSENG: I know but, you know, there's too many. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Are you ready to win?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I really just every week ready to win a tournament. I was thinking because I did four seconds, I really learn a lot of experience from the different second place. Like last one I had British Open. That's my best second place I have. 
 I just don't feel very surprised, because I think I just keep learning and just keep working hard and be very friendly and be relaxed and everybody will cheering for me.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: One more. The last time we were at the State Farm Classic together you had the lead going into Sunday, and you said that was your first time having the lead on a Saturday night. Did you learn anything from that that's going to help you tonight? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I think so. Tomorrow I think I just play my own game and then just don't think too much, because I had a four-shot lead and I have a lot of room to playing good. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Questions for Yani. 

 Q. What can you tell us about your experience playing on the Canadian tour last year? Is it a good omen for you to be leading the Canadian Open after that?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I think last year is very good experience for me, because I think that's my second LPGA tournament. That tournament let me know how big is the LPGA and how tough is LPGA. 
 So that tournament just really give me a lot of experience and help me work really hard getting into Q-School and the LPGA. So I think I'm just very happy to come back here, and everybody was very nice. 

 Q. Ashley asked you if you thought your season was good. I was going to ask you if you thought your day would be this good. Today you made, by my count, ten birdies in 26 holes. 
 YANI TSENG: I was really nervous today afternoon. On first couple holes I couldn't hold my tempo and I was thinking a lot playing with Lorena and the last group. I feel so nervous, but we just -- very good day for me. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: You're tired.
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I'm very tired. 

 Q. At what age did you turn pro?
 YANI TSENG: Last year. 

 Q. What age? 
 YANI TSENG: 18. Yeah, but I was trying to go Q-School, but they say I was too young so I wait for a year.

 Q. You say that you have a lot of confidence and you've been shooting almost a minus five the last three days. Earlier I asked the other girl a question if it's easier to be in first or second place? Do you feel more pressure when you're coming up from behind, or will you feel more pressure going into tomorrow's round?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I feel more pressure going into Sunday, but this is my second time so it's in the quite as nervous, not quite as pressure like last time. 
 So this time I feel very good. I feel I'm ready to win. 

 Q. Did you find the pin placing today more difficult than yesterday on the greens?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, some hole is very tough. You need to play smart.

 Q. So can we expect another minus four tomorrow?
 YANI TSENG: Yes, I would like that. 

 Q. Okay. You mentioned you were nervous coming into today. You have to be relaxed tomorrow. Seemed like your group was pretty loose out there. Talk about your pairings today. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, just first couple holes. I didn't think I will be nervous, but I don't know why. I just couldn't hit a ball and think a lot. 
 So just I think tomorrow I have four-shot lead, so that will be a lot of different for me.
