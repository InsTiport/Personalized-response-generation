  Q. 4-under, you're sitting at quite a strong position for tomorrow, how did you feel it went today?   
 YANI TSENG: I feel very confident. I had a really good last two holes and next thing, it's 4-under, and I couldn't focus to talk to you. (Laughing).  
  
  Q. You feel that you were stronger, you had a couple of good last holes?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, last two holes, kind of back in position, because after 16, I was still 1-over. But now I finish 1-under, so still I'm three shots behind, so it's pretty good. So I'm motivated to go and I feel very confident.
