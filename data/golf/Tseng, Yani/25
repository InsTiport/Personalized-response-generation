Q.   Overall thought of the match today, the drama on 18 here. 
YANI TSENG:   I know how the U.S. feels after yesterday, but it's fun today.   We played great out there.   I didn't make as many putts as yesterday, but I did my best and I left some out there, for sure.
But Thailand, they played awesome today.   So there was no doubt of that.   They, both of them, make probably eight birdies out there.   So you got to play great to beat them. 
Coming down the last hole, it's tough hole and Mo hit three great shots to make birdie just like me yesterday.   So it's a little opposite than yesterday, but still we have one more day to go and we still can win two matches tomorrow.

Q.   Do you still feel good heading into tomorrow?   You played so well yesterday. 
YANI TSENG:   We feel good.   We played well today.   I mean, tomorrow we're against Spain, they're a pretty tough team, too, so it gives us good focus.   Thailand, they're great, they played awesome.   So tomorrow, it's just, I think Spain's tough and we're going to stay tough, too.
