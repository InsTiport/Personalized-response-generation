Q. What did it mean to you to be picked by Ai Miyazato and play with her?
YANI TSENG: It's amazing.  It was so much fun the last two days.  I don't make it to tomorrow, but it's my pleasure.  I'm just so happy when I heard that she picked me.  I almost cried.  She's one of the best people on Tour, and I'm really, really lucky to have friends like her on and off the Tour, and I just wish her the best in her other careers, and I'm just so happy, so grateful for everything.
