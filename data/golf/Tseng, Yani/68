 Q.   So I know it wasn't your best day out there, but still, to have a chance on 18.   
YANI TSENG:   I was totally shocked that I couldn't make that.   But I tried my best again.   I finished strong, and I don't know, it was a day I really don't want, but I give my 100 percent effort out there.   
And I don't feel I played really bad today.   I think just needed a little more luck to drop some putt.   I putt very good.   I mean also it was a good try.   And you never know for sure if you have a chance like that.  
A little disappointed, but not really.   You know, it's not the end of the world, so I'll come back next year and try to win in this tournament.  
   
 Q.   And just take me through, how were you able to keep yourself mentally?   I know it was a tough start when you were falling away from the top of the leaderboard, but how did you keep yourself in it through the rest of the round?  
YANI TSENG:   Just be patient.   Today out there, like I said, I didn't make lots of putts, but I made good shots.   The ball just didn't go in.   Maybe this is the day the gods wanted another player to win this tournament.   
But I say I did my best in the end and I still finished strong and just looking forward to come back next year.
