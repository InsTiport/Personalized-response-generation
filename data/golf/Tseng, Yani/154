   THE MODERATOR: Thank you for being here. So far, two great rounds, 7-under. How do you feel?   
 YANI TSENG: Actually I feel pretty good today. But I had a bogey to start. I am very disappointed because I had a bet with Lorena for bogey-free and I'm like, oh, my God, I made a bogey on the first hole.   
 I had seven birdies today and I had one 4-putt, and that's really bad.   
  
  Q. What number?  
 YANI TSENG: No. 8. I had a 4-putt on No. 8.   
  
  Q. It was a double-bogey?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, on No. 8. I just made a few mistakes today but I made lots of birdies and I'm really happy for today.   
  
  Q. You struggled at some holes but you're still in the lead. Does that give you more confidence going into tomorrow, knowing that even though you had some struggles, you can still manage to stay with the best of them?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, actually, like my putting today, the distance control was not really good, so I will work on that with my putting.  
 You know, I'm (playing) in the morning, and I finished and I'm still in good position, but I know Lorena will shoot like crazy. I'm still in position and I'm just really looking forward for tomorrow and make some birdies.
