   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yani, thanks for joining us today. I told you I had some good news for you, and here it is: Your 64 broke the course record here. You Cristie Kerr held it in 2006. You're in the lead. You've got about a three-stroke lead right now sitting here going into the weekend. Talk about how you feel. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, it was awesome. I know that. I just tell my coach I break the tournament record for that. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: You knew? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I knew. But I still hope I can break my record. 62 is my record. But I still feel very good, and I'm exciting for tomorrow. Maybe play with Ochoa, so that's my -- it's kind of like dream I play with No. 1 in the world, so I'm very exciting for that.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Great round out there. Let's go over all the birdies you had, starting with the first birdie on the first hole.
 YANI TSENG: 12 feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What club? 
 YANI TSENG: Pitching wedge. And No. 3 is, hmmm, let me see. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: It was a Par 5, 518 yards. 
 YANI TSENG: Oh, yeah. Second shot I use 3-wood and I chip on for like 12 feet, too. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 4, Par 4. 
 YANI TSENG: 4, I using 58 and 12 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay.
 YANI TSENG: And No. 5 is 20 feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What club? 
 YANI TSENG: A 6.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay.
 YANI TSENG: No. 6 is 8 and it's, let me see, 18 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 9.
 YANI TSENG: On 9 I hit on two with rescue. I made the eagle chance for that. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Roughly how close?
 YANI TSENG: Like nine feet. Yeah, I made that. The ball was bump up. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 10.
 YANI TSENG: No. 10 I use 5-wood for second shot, and then chip on for two feet. 
 No. 11, 18 feet; I using 9-iron.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. 
 YANI TSENG: Number 15, that was long putt, 15 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What club? 
 YANI TSENG: Pitching wedge. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: To 15 feet. You had a lot of long putts. What happened on the bogey on 18? 
 YANI TSENG: I think I was trying too hard the last three holes. On 18 I just too quick, my swing, and just pushed it right in the bunker.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: That was your drive?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What was your second shot? 
 YANI TSENG: I was trying to hit in the middle of the green. It gives a the steep is so big on that, so I just played more safe for that. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Was that a two or three-putt? 
 YANI TSENG: Two-putt. It was almost in.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How close was the first putt? 
 YANI TSENG: How close? Not really close, like 17 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. Questions? 

 Q. Talk about what it's like when you get into a rhythm like today when you are on a string of birdies, and what it felt like for you out there today. 
 YANI TSENG: How I feel is very confident. I fell I have a lot of confidence for my putting. Every time I when have second shot I always thinking I want to make birdie, because I think I have a lot of confidence for that. 
 So I think this putter is from Dave Stockton. This is my coach's putter. I feel so good. I just changed it this week. Maybe change it a little bit, change some stroke, and, yeah, change your mind. 

 Q. So you think you will keep using this putter?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I will keep using. I don't want to return to him. 

 Q. You were saying it's such a dream to play with the world's No. 1 player. Why would that be?
 YANI TSENG: Just I start very young, when I was six years old. I feel at that time after two, three years I feel I going to be the No. 1 in the world. 
 I always dream I can play with the No. 1 in the world and to learn a lot of things from them. Just feel like if I can keep fighting for that, that will be very exciting for me. Yeah. 

 Q. You said you shot a 62 before. Where was that?
 YANI TSENG: Indonesia, junior. It was just junior. When I was like 15 or 16 years old. Yeah. I make the eagle also, but I made bogey today. 

 Q. (Question regarding what she learned from playing on the other tours.)
 YANI TSENG: I still don't understand. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What did you learn from the other tours you played to get here? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. This is the first level in the world, so I just learn just that -- I think just experience for me to keep doing the tournaments and feel how the pros, how the professional is doing. 
 Just I learn a lot in LPGA, but it's not much in like Asian Tour or something. Because I feel very (indiscernible) when I play the Asian Tour. 
 Here I feel I'm more pressure and everybody, you don't know who going to win this tournament. So it's really tough here. 

 Q. I believe and you Teresa, I assume you're friends because you live in the same U.S. host house in the California. Talk a little bit about that and how that worked out.
 YANI TSENG: We live like one hours away.

 Q. So you live in Florida?
 YANI TSENG: No, in California. One hours. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: One hour away? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, we live like one hours away. But before we was playing a lot of tournaments in the junior in Taiwan, somewhere else. So we really good friends and we hang out together before when we was amateur. 
 But here in America it's huge, big, so we just keep doing just say like, Good luck, everything, to you. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: But you both have the same mentor, Ernie is both of your host? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, but I didn't live in Ernie's home. She was living in Ernie's home past two, three years. But I didn't live here.

 Q. You all didn't live together?
 YANI TSENG: No. 

 Q. There seems to be a big influx of Taiwanese players coming over. Do you remember a player by the name of by the name of Ai-Yu Tu?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, she was very famous in Taiwan.

 Q. Would she be the most famous Taiwanese player?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah.

 Q. Did she kind of open the gates for young girls from Taiwan, would you say?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. I just play with her like this January and she just teach me a lot. So she's kind of very nice. Yeah, she open the gate for young people. 

 Q. Sort of like Se Ri Pak was in Korea?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah.

 Q. How long have you been there? 
 YANI TSENG: I just move there half year, like six months ago. It's so windy over there. 

 Q. At what point today did you start thinking about a 62 or breaking your own record?
 YANI TSENG: The back 9.

 Q. Just like on 10?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, on 10. But I still didn't try too hard. But on the last three holes I just thinking, oh, I want to make more. It's Par 5 on 17, easy Par 5. 
 So I don't think -- I just think I try too hard and I think I just need to make the swing and make it good, whatever the ball does. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: You said in Mexico City that last round that you weren't as patient as you should have been. Do you think you've learned some patience and that that showed today? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I think so. I was very patient today. I think that's the confidence to me. If I be very confidence I will be very patient. Yeah. 

 Q. You said you look up to the No. 1 player, Lorena. You're beating her right now. How does that feel? Do you like having the lead in a tournament? Is there any added pressure for you?
 YANI TSENG: No, I think it's no pressure. It's very good to lead in the tournament and play with Ochoa. I think it's very -- I don't feel very much pressure. I just keep doing my job. Yeah.
