Q.   What a wonderful round on day three of the HSBC Women's Champions, certainly making a move. 
YANI TSENG:   I know it was much better than the last two days.   I make some putts today.   Today I hit the ball better and I'm having fun out there and so many fans coming out supporting us, it's a pretty big crowd today. 
So very enjoying, and one more day to go, hopefully tomorrow I can be patient. 

Q.   What is the difference between the first two days, whereby your own standard, you have not played well, can you pinpoint today exactly what was going right?
YANI TSENG:   I feel like I'm always slowing down, kind of like upset the other people.   But today I just tell myself, I want to try to make birdie every hole, like as many birdies as I can and try to get close every shot, be aggressive and don't worry about it too much.

Q.   Four shots off the lead at the moment, feeling obviously very confident about tomorrow, four shots is nothing in your game?
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I'm trying.   I will do my best tomorrow.   This golf course is very tough, so you need to be patient, play smart. 

Q.   You were a pretty dynamic duo out there, your caddie is wearing a rather special bib; HSBC Caddie of the Year. 
YANI TSENG:   It was very special for him.   He's a great caddie and he's been helping me out a lot the last year and we have had like 12, 13 wins together.   He's a really nice guy and very fun to see him win.   He's very special.
