 Q.   You did not see it go in?  
YANI TSENG:   No.   I see where it was, but I did not see it go in.   I had a hard time seeing the ball today.   So I see it was good in the air, so that's all I needed.   This is my first hole‑in‑one since I turned pro.   
   
 Q.   Oh, it is?  
YANI TSENG:   I've been waiting for a long time.  
   
 Q.   No kidding?  
YANI TSENG:   And I got it, too.   So that was good.  
   
 Q.   How many have you had in your lifetime?  
YANI TSENG:   This is five.   I have four when I was on the amateur.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   
YANI TSENG:   So that was fun.   
   
 Q.   Did you know it was good as soon as you hit it?  
YANI TSENG:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Just describe it.   
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I mean after I hit it, I know it was a good shot.   But I was just trying to be good distance, and I wasn't thinking it was going to go in the hole.   I thought it would be perfect.  
   
 Q.   How are you feeling?   Are you getting better?  
YANI TSENG:   I'm getting better, but my gums, like my tooth still hurts really bad.   So I couldn't eat much.   
But everything is getting so much better.   Like my energy level, my everything is kind of very good.   Like I don't feel tired after 18 holes.   So it's good.  
   
 Q.   I think I read it was tonsillitis and it spread up?  
YANI TSENG:   Yeah.   But now it's all gone.   It's still swollen a little bit, but it's not bad.  
   
 Q.   What have you eaten?   What did you eat yesterday?   What did you eat today?  
YANI TSENG:   I went in a Chinese restaurant, and the owner was from Taiwan, too, so they make like congee for me to eat, you know, like water with rice.   I'm like old people now, couldn't chew much.   
   
 Q.   Here she insults millions of old people.   
YANI TSENG:   Yeah.   So I was like my grandma, every time she eats, we have to kind of like a bird, so now I'm doing the same thing.   
   
 Q.   What do you think of the whole round today?  
YANI TSENG:   I hit it very solid today.   My ball is precision.   My alignment is much better.   So I just need to trust my swing more.   And I mean I hit lots of good shots out there, hit lots of good drives, too.   I had like one yard, like one feet and just in the rough.   And those rough, it's very tough.   So just need to be patient and I make couple bogeys out there, but I don't feel anything because I know everybody is going to make bogey.   So I mean just be patient and try to get it on the fairway and just do the best you can do because it's a very tough course, especially it's wet.   It's hard to get lucky in the rough, I mean this rough.  
   
 Q.   Do you have the other four holes that you made holes in one?  
YANI TSENG:   No.  
   
 Q.   So can I have that one?  
YANI TSENG:   No.  
   
 Q.   Do you have any of those four?  
YANI TSENG:   No, I don't.
