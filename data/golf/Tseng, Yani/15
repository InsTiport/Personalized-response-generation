 Q.  Another good week, feeling pretty good about the consistency you're showing pretty recently?  
YANI TSENG: Yeah, I feel good out there.  I mean, the greens was very tricky, so I just need to get the speed right on the course.  I love this course.  I have won here before, so that brings me lots of good memories.   
I'm just very happy to be back, and especially all the Korean fans, they are awesome.  Just I feel good about my game and feel very comfortable, and of course I really enjoy playing golf.   
 Q.  When someone shoots 62 the first day, does it almost make you have less to lose, you feel like, where you can go out and be more aggressive, or not?  
YANI TSENG: No, I just try to see she's not there (laughing).  It's crazy, shot 10-under yesterday, especially pretty tough.  But I heard she was saying she hits it miles.  Actually excited to see her maybe play on TV a little bit how far she hits.  That's amazing, great player, playing so good.   
 Q.  What do you remember about the win here?  
YANI TSENG: I played good.  I think all I remember is all the fans on the last hole, the last group, me and Na Yeon Choi, thousands of people on the course.  Pretty exciting and little nerves on the course.  Luckily I can take a lot from that the next few days.
