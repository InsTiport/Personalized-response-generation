  YANI TSENG:   I feel pretty good, first day of the tournament, I feel like I'm hitting so many good shots out there, making some good putts to save the par, and I'm very happy and very enjoyed playing with Ai and Paula today.   
The major, it's four days tournament, just have to be patient on this tough golf course, and today maybe it's kind of a good day to make some more birdies but I don't think you want to try too hard out there, because the harder you try, the worse you get.  
   
 Q.   The wind is such a factor on this course; did you feel when you got up this morning that it might just be‑‑  
YANI TSENG:   This morning was a little windy for the first few holes but after that, it's kind of quiet.   But I mean, I wasn't thinking too much.   I still try to be patient, stay with my same strategy because I know the wind can make it very tough, but you have to stick to your routine.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you left a few out there today or that's the score you should have shot today?   
YANI TSENG:   You always feel like you left some out there, but I'm still very happy.   I wasn't thinking about, if I can do that, that would be great.   It's over today.   I'm very happy what I've done, even par, and I know I had a 4‑putt on No. 11, but that's it.   That's probably the only thing that I can say I left some out there.   But I give it my hundred percent every shot out there, I make 6, but everything I was very happy.
