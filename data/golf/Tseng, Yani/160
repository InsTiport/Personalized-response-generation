   JASON TAYLOR: Yani, thanks for joining us today. Nice round. 3-under par for the opening round this week. Your thoughts on today. 
 YANI TSENG: I feel pretty good today, but I didn't play the tournament for two weeks so kind of very exciting and looking forward for this tournament. 
 But I hit solid and I make 3-under par for today.
 JASON TAYLOR: Great. Questions. 

 Q. Did you work with your coach in your two weeks? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. I change a little bit swing from last two weeks, so I try to just stay used to my swing. But I didn't work that much with my coach, but I still just get used to my swing and practice a little bit.

 Q. What did you change specifically?
 YANI TSENG: I change my backswing, because when I at Canada Open my swing was terrible, like amateur. So I just feel like -- my coach keep telling me, You need to change a little bit. So I change my backswing and take a little bit inside. 

 Q. You missed the cut for the first time in Portland. Was that part of what made you go back and work on your swing?
 YANI TSENG: I think that tournament just mental things. The first one -- I kind of bring a little bit from Canada. I still feel very sad and I couldn't really feel. 
 But I feel it's really good. I missed the cut and I learned a lot things. Even from the last group -- I feel I learned more than like -- when I miss cut I feel like learn a little more than when I'm was in last group. 
 So I feel I go up a little bit, so I know what I gonna do now.
