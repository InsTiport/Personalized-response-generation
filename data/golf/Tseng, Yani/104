 Q. 4-under. Still a good day. I know not the finish you wanted, but still can you come away from this round pretty happy about how you played?
 YANI TSENG: No, I was very disappointed. I miss a lot of putts. I had three 3-putt today. I hit lots of greens, but I just couldn't make that much putt and hitting the second shot. 
 But hopefully next three days I can have more putts.

 Q. Is that something this afternoon that you would want to work on? Is that the one thing that you think can help out for the rest of the three days?
 YANI TSENG: I stroke pretty good. Yeah, maybe. And then the wind kind of get stronger the back nine a little bit and kind of swirling a little bit, so it's very harder adjustment. Then just didn't finish the way I wanted to finish. Two bogey in a row last two hole, so I was really disappointed.

 Q. Still, two shots off the lead after day one. You put yourself in a good position. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, not bad. But I think lots of people going to shoot 4-under, 5-under, 6-under. It's only first day, so three more days to go. I'm still looking forward, so hopefully get some more birdies in next three days.
