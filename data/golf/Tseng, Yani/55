  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Rolex Rankings No. 1, Yani Tseng, into the interview room.   Congratulations, a great 5‑under round for you today.   I know we've talked a lot about the struggles over the past few months.   How great was it to be able to go out there today and put together a round like this following what was a solid round yesterday? 
YANI TSENG:   It's been a long time.   I haven't shot like 5‑under for a couple months.   It feels great.   I wasn't worried about anything.   I wasn't worried if I was going to shoot under par or not.   I just felt like I'm going to enjoy every shot out there.   I'm going to have so much fun, doesn't matter how I played. 
And I couldn't ask for a better group that I had.   It's just so much fun.   They kept me relaxed all the time, and it's just great.   My game seems like it's coming back, and I'm hitting so many good shots just like before.   This is a game I love, and I really appreciate everything. 
THE MODERATOR:   Yesterday and today, what was the biggest difference for you in being able to put together these back‑to‑back rounds and make so many birdies? 
YANI TSENG:   I think Rory winning the PGA Championship gave me a lot of inspiration.   He had four missed cuts in a row, I only have two, so I'm better off than he was.   But he's just trying to forget about everything, and just go out there and try to do the best that he can. 
I watched his interview before I played.   He was saying this is the thing that he always do when he was a kid, so there is nothing to put more pressure and be hard on yourself.   Just be more relaxed and enjoy every shot that you can. 
He said when you play good, it's always easy to do it.   But when you're playing bad, it's very hard to do.   I just feel like my vacation is finished.   I had a two month vacation the last couple months, so I feel that's long enough for me.   I need to get back as quick as possible and enjoy the golf course. 
THE MODERATOR:   Now seeing yourself back up on the first page of the leaderboard must be pretty good.
YANI TSENG:   It's awesome.   It feels good to be sitting here, talking to you guys too, having an interview after I played.   I mean, I haven't been in the field for a long time already.   So it's always good. 
I still feel there is a long way to go this year.   We have so many tournaments.   I just feel like good right now.

Q.   Stacy Lewis is now leading the Money List and the Rolex Player of the Year Points. Does that give you motivation to try and catch her?
YANI TSENG:   I don't know.   I didn't think about that, because I think those things give me more pressure.   When I look at those things, I just feel like I play for that, but I'm not playing for that.   I play for what I love.   I play for myself and what I want.   What can I do to win the tournament?   I love winning tournaments.   I don't think there is anything that I need to think about to give myself motivation, because I think we need a tournament and being on the Tour I'm having so much fun here that it's my motivation to play well.

Q.   What do you have to do tomorrow to win?
YANI TSENG:   I'm 5 shots back, so on this course, you can make a lot of birdies here.   Today I could make more birdies if I dropped a couple more putts, but there is always something you can improve. 
But I feel I'm getting back.   I can get back slowly.   I don't have to win this week.   I can play well tomorrow and maybe next week I'll win, but you never know.   I don't want to rush, because I feel like I'm too rushed and it gets worse.   So I'll play step by step and one shot at a time and do the best I can tomorrow.

Q.   You threw the ball in the water on No. 9 after you settled for a three-putt par to finish your day. Was that a sign of that competitive fire coming back?
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, of course, I mean, especially the numbers at five.   I treat that as a long par‑4, so I feel like I made bogey over there, because it's a reachable second shot.   I only hit a 4‑iron there.   Like today, my speed was always off.   I've been hitting so many putts past the hole, so I think it's just a speed problem.   Maybe I'm too aggressive to try to make eagle there, but it was like a 25‑yard putt.   So I was thinking of making two‑putt, but it just didn't go where I wanted.   But I'm still in a good position.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow and making more putts.

Q.   Why don t you sign golf balls?
YANI TSENG:   It was before when I signed a ball, they sell it online.   So when I go online, I said why are you selling my ball?   I mean, I don't like that.   If you really want it, you should keep it.   If I want it, I won't sell it or make money off of it.   Because if I love that player, I won't do it.   But there are some balls that are kind of very important to us here.

Q.   But you are willing to sign almost anything else?
YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I would be happy to sign that.   I used to sign balls before, but after that thing happened I just don't really do it.   But I can sign anything else.

Q.   Do you feel like you missed some opportunities out there today?
YANI TSENG:   No, not really.   I mean, 9 is one shot.   Everything else, I made a lot of putts today.   I made lots like four feet and five feet to make birdie and save par.   So I feel like I played good today.   I don't think there are that many shots that I left out there. 
On number 10, because that's our first hole, and it's kind of cold so we're hitting shorter.   But it was like a regular par‑5 last year.
