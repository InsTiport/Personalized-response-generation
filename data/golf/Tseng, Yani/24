  YANI TSENG:   I didn't give up any shot and I feel like I played fearless and not worry about too much out there. 
    Really enjoy every shot I hit.   Very happy the first day I played.

Q.   Yani, you just looked so relaxed and confident and got on with it.   I think that's been where you're been struggling.   Today really did look like the Yani of old. 
    YANI TSENG:   It is, and it's easy to see.   It's been couple years I really try to feel more comfortable out there and just enjoy myself and not worry about the score too much and be relax and play golf.
    It's amazing, that feeling play free out there and not worry about anything and just play by myself and play my own game.   I feel very happy.   Doesn't matter what my score is, I just feel much happier now.

Q.   That's a real difference for you.   I know we've spoken a lot in the past, and you were getting on such a downer and it was a mental drain.   To see you smile at the golf course today, it's been a long time since I've seen that smile.   You looked in such a good place. 
    YANI TSENG:   Yeah, I mean last couple year my smile was not really real.   This year I feel like I really smile from my heart, from the inside. 
    It's not easy to do, and I been trying to do it for every day.   I make same mistake every day, every tournament.   I just try to improve and try to feel as comfortable as I can. 
    Just like before, doesn't matter how the score.   It doesn't matter how the score doing.   I want to be comfortable out there and I know I can play good golf.

Q.   You are now injuryâ€‘free. 
    YANI TSENG:   I know I have a little heart injury from last couple years, but I think now I'm done and I can't wait to get back.
