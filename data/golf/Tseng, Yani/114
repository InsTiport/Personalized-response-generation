  Q. Can you tell me about your round today?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I was a little stronger with reading the putts. You have to be patient all day. Finished 2 over. Stronger with reading the putt. You had to really be patient all day.   
 Finished 2 over. I just have to be patient and, you know, tournament, you're not gonna win it on first day. Like I kind of get used to the golf course, and then, you know, I just kind of got to go back in the afternoon.  
  
  Q. Is it good to finally get to play after you didn't get to do anything yesterday?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, for sure. I was always very happy to get on the course and play on the course and try to beat the course, too.   
  
  Q. Did you do anything special? Doing 36 holes in one day, do you do any special preparations or anything?  
 YANI TSENG: Nothing special. It's all the same.
