 Q. How did it go for you? 
 YANI TSENG: It's pretty good. I finish well again, like the last two days. I'm very happy. I birdied 16 and 17 and jumping in the top three, so I'm very happy with it. I really enjoyed it here, big crowds today and yesterday. So it was really good. And the course is great. I really enjoyed it out there.

 Q. And how did your birdies go on 16 and 17? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, that was a great chip-in. Actually I didn't expect that. I just wanted to get close and then just chipped in. That was pretty good. I'm very happy. That was a good shot. 

 Q. And then the 17th, what happened on the 17th? How did you see that one? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I chip it in.
