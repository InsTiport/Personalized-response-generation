   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Yani, congratulations. You just won the McDonald's LPGA Championship presented by Coca-Cola. You are the fist rookie to win a Major since Se Ri Pak won this event in 1998. So how do you feel right now? 
 YANI TSENG: I feel very excited. I couldn't believe it, I just won a Major. I'm a rookie. And everything just came so fast. So I'm just really excited for this.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: We'll take questions for Yani.

 Q. How nervous were you standing over that last putt?
 YANI TSENG: I wasn't that nervous when I teed off, you know. I just tell myself, just make this putt and win a Major Championship. (Laughter)
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: When was the last time you were in a playoff? 
 YANI TSENG: The last time, I think it was March. I played the Asian tour. I played with Taiwan player in a playoff. This is my third time or four time playing in a playoff in this year. A lot of experience for playoff.

 Q. You were in the lead down the stretch in that tournament in Florida in April. How much did that help, do you think, today just having had that experience?
 YANI TSENG: It kind of feels different because I was 4 shots behind and I didn't think I would win the tournament. I just really do my job and then just play like yesterday. And it's very different playing with Lorena. It's very relaxed this week. Today. Not like last time I was very nervous to try to catch up with her. So today my play was very good feel of today.

 Q. I was curious, when you hit your tee shot on the last hole, you didn't look like you liked it?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. I pushed it twice when I played the 18 hole.

 Q. What did you have left for your second shot?
 YANI TSENG: You mean, the second time in the playoff? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 YANI TSENG: The 6-iron. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: How close was it, about 6 feet? 
 YANI TSENG: I think 5 feet. Yeah, it was 5 feet.

 Q. Was it nerve-racking at all waiting for her to miss those birdie putts on some of the other holes?
 YANI TSENG: I mean, I missed a couple putts --
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Were you nervous waiting for Maria to make her putts? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I was very nervous. After I saw she missed I was like Oh, that's good. (Laughter) So I feel very good with that. And I just don't like to watch the people just make the putt. My caddie say look at; I was like Yeah, so.

 Q. I wonder if you could talk about the 13th hole and the 15th hole. Both times you were in trouble?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah I pushed my driver again because I just hear something and I pushed it right off. You know, I hit the 7-iron for my second shot. It was like 30 off on the pin, and left, so I just hit it sure and make a two putt.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: How far was the two putt? 
 YANI TSENG: Not close.

 Q. I mean, that one and 15 when you also hit it to the left, those were two holes where the tournament could have -- it looked like you were struggling and you held it together?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I feel a little bit tired with the back nine because it was very hot and everything. Just humid. 
 And on number 15 I never hit on the fairway. I say today I got to hit it on the fairway and then make the second shot. And I just pulled again. But it's very lucky too I can just punch out to hit a third shot. It's very lucky for that shot, I think.

 Q. What did you have for your third shot there? On 15?
 YANI TSENG: 205 to the pin and I just hit a rescue and put it right on the green and make a two putt and go.

 Q. You seem to be picking up fans on every hole. By the end there was a group of people screaming, Yani, go Yani. Did you know any of those people? And what was that like to have all that support?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, that was very good support. Before I just heard Lorena, Lorena. And today it's Yani, Yani. So it's very exciting. I met them in the Sybase, I played Pro-Am with them. So they're kind of Pro-Am partner. They drive from New York. So I'm very happy to see them to support me in the tournament.

 Q. How do you think you'll feel going into the U.S. Women's Open already having won a Major this year?
 YANI TSENG: I think just stay relaxed and just play like the last two. The coach tell me just relax, play your game, don't try too hard. So today I really just enjoyed the golf.

 Q. Can you just tell us a little bit about how you started golf and where you live now and why you live there?
 YANI TSENG: I started golf five or six years old. And I just moved to thirty minutes from Palm Springs, Beaumont. I don't know if you guys know that.

 Q. Why?
 YANI TSENG: Just golf. No fun. Just golf. (Laughter)
Q. Beaumont?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah Beaumont.

 Q. I know where it is that's why I'm asking. Is it really hot and desert there?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah my friend just all retired so nobody knows me. So I like the dry air in California.

 Q. Congratulations, I heard Emmy Hanson and you are going to have a big party tonight?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah I hope they give me a big party. I don't know if they will. But it's sad that I can't drink. I can't have a beer when I have a party.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 YANI TSENG: I'm from Taoyuan is very close to Taipei. And when I play golf I just watch her win a lot of tournament and try to -- oh, this is my super idol, I mean, like that. She's always very nice to the young people.

 Q. Did you actually see her or talk to her?
 YANI TSENG: She's playing in Japan now. So it's not really -- maybe just January I see her maybe just a couple times of the year.

 Q. Did you have any heroes -- golfing heroes -- when you were growing up?
 YANI TSENG: You mean?

 Q. People you looked up to -- your favorite golfers?
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Role models growing up.
 YANI TSENG: Oh yeah. Tiger woods. Annika. I was watching Annika too.

 Q. Did you know much about T. C. Chen?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah I know when I was one hour away from my home. So when he came in to practice we just play together and he always teach me something because I'm a rookie. He teach me how to traveling and everything -- booking. So he's very nice.

 Q. Do you know much about his chance to win a major?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I know. Last week I just saw the top-10 and missed the double chip. (Laughter) That's first time I saw it on the TV. I couldn't believe it. That's not really hard shot for that. (Laughter) After that I watched I tell my coach, because I watched him play golf now, so I said Oh I know maybe that's why he chipped a double chip. (Laughter)

 Q. So you almost did it last week?
 YANI TSENG: His technique maybe is a lot of chance to make a double chip. (Laughter) But don't tell him that because I feel bad. (Laughter)

 Q. After what you accomplished as an amateur do you feel you could do this as a professional?
 YANI TSENG: This is my dream. I don't feel it come very fast. This is just I couldn't believe it. Because I didn't play very well on the first two rounds and I just come back very good. And win a Major.

 Q. Can you just (No microphone.)
 YANI TSENG: For sure. I tried to support Taiwan the golf everybody. Because now is getting better and I hope after this time they can more like everybody can support golf in Taiwan and they can come in to the LPGA to play golf.

 Q. I think a lot of people remember when you came back and beat Michelle Wie in the Publix then the next year you beat Morgan Pressel. There's a lot of people, a lot of players turning pro very early. Were you tempted to do that as well? Why did you wait so long to turn pro?
 YANI TSENG: I was trying to play through school the last two years but they said I'm too young I couldn't make it. So I just waited one more year and just practiced and waited for the Q-School. And now I'm just in the LPGA.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Yani, can we go over your scorecard right now. As far as number one your birdie.
 YANI TSENG: The first hole, the pitching wedge for 10 yards, maybe 35 feet.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Number 3.
 YANI TSENG: Number 3 is 9-iron with about 12 feet.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Number 5.
 YANI TSENG: Number 5, that's a long putt. That's like 27 feet with a 4-iron.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Number 8.
 YANI TSENG: Number 8, I hit the 5-wood. Hit a ridge on two for 18 feet and make two putt.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. Number 13 you had a 7-iron to 30 feet and you two putted.
 YANI TSENG: Yeah I made bogey.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: And then 14.
 YANI TSENG: 14, I hit 52 on the green and 9 feet for birdie putt. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: And then how far was your driver and then your approach shot on 16? You almost drove it on 16 didn't you? 
 YANI TSENG: No that was Lorena. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: I'm sorry. (Laughter)

 Q. After today, who is the more famous golfer in Taiwan, you or T. C. Chen?
 YANI TSENG: Me and T. C. Chen. (Laughter) Both very famous.

 Q. The first day you shot 73 were you disappointed? What was your mindset after that?
