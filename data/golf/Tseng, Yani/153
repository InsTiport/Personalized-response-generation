   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Yani, I know you're a little disappointed right now, but you had a great, great tournament. Can you talk about playing in Mexico and playing so well? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. I did very good today, except last hole. I was really patient and played really smart today, and I hit in the water on number nine and I had an aggressive great save over there. 
 I'm very disappointed because this is my second time in Mexico and second place. Second last year. And I did have a good chance this year, but I just didn't make it. So I worked very, very hard this last year. I got five seconds.

 Q. Yani, what did you overall learn today?
 YANI TSENG: Actually, I really learned a lot from last year. I feel like I played really good today, but my putting distance control was really bad all week, like my long putt. 
 And I really learned a lot. I've been more patient. I've been more slower, and I didn't think that I wouldn't win the tournament, and even though I'm the leader through 17 holes, so I figured I really learned a lot from last years to today.

 Q. Can you talk about how you go and you get ready for next week and you refocus for next week?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. I think now I have good confidence. 
 I feel I improved a lot from last year, so I'm really getting ready for next week's tournament. I'm really ready to win it.
