CHRISTINA LANCE: Brittany, we know the LPGA is such a world tour and you were in New Zealand and Korea and Malaysia, how do you balance all that to make sure you're ready to tee off when we're ready to play on Thursday?
BRITTANY LINCICOME: Well, I drink a lot of tea.  I just try to get enough sleep and rest as possible after a very hot and very long week.
Q. Yani this is your second straight appearance, how do you feel coming back to Taiwan?
YANI TSENG: The main difference is it's home and the more fans, the more enjoyable it is.  It comes with more pressure but I'm happy with pressure.  But I've been practicing and I feel very comfortable playing here.
Q. You've played Miramar several times and the weather will always be a factor in the score.  What do you expect this time?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, the wind is really a factor.  This golf course has a lot of -- I think even last year was super windy and there was still some really low scores.  It's just about playing smart and when you get an opportunity try to grab a birdie.  I think the weather is huge around this golf course, so you really have to be smart.
Q. How do you deal the pressure of being No. 1 in the world?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, being in that position -- there are expectations.  Especially are the rankings it's more about consistency and how many times you get yourself in contention and how consistent you are in the season.
