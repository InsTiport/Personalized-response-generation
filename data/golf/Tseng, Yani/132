  Q. Well played today. Just talk about 18. Nice to finish like that?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, that's for sure. Very exciting for me to finish birdie. I played pretty solid today, 3-under, it's not bad, and we just kind of treading water on 17 holes but everything was good. Very happy, very consistent and very good today and made some putts.  
  
  Q. What do you think for tomorrow, you'll probably be maybe eight or nine shots back; what's your mentality coming in?  
 YANI TSENG: I don't know. I don't know. I know it's kind of -- seven, eight shots behind, but I'll still do my best and try to win, too. But just play aggressive.  
 I don't know, tomorrow, I really have no idea (laughing).   
  
  Q. Are you happy with your week so far?  
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I'm very happy. I know everybody was thinking if I can win five in a row, but I'm kind of pretty relaxed. This is golf, and that's why it's a challenge. Every week is different and that's why it's so much fun, everybody is playing and I just really enjoy it.
