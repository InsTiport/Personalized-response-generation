   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yani, thanks for coming in and joining us today. This is your first time here in the Sybase classic. Can you just kind of talk about the course and how it feels to you? 
 YANI TSENG: I just walk 18 holes Monday and I just played nine holes and the course is really classic and tree-lined, so it's a very good golf course. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And we were just talking, you said you kind of wind into New York City yesterday, was that your first time in New York City? 
 YANI TSENG: It was my second time, not first time. But yesterday I went shopping a lot and I see a Broadway show. It's my first time to see a Broadway show. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What show? 
 YANI TSENG: A Chorus Line. It's very fun. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And you were telling me how you heard about Annika Sorenstam's announcement that she made yesterday. Where were you and how did you see it? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I see it in time square on like ESPN, they show Annika got announcement for retirement for end of season, and when I looked at that, I was feeling upset. I was very upset when she announced she got retired because I'm just a rookie and she's retiring. 
 So I hope I can play with her a couple of times this year. 

 Q. What do you like about her as a person? 
 YANI TSENG: You mean Annika? I think she's very friendly to everybody and she is playing good golf and I think she just -- she kind of very open heart. 

 Q. Have you played with her? 
 YANI TSENG: I played with her in a practise round, so I learn something from her, too. Her attitude and her body language. 

 Q. What about her body language? 
 YANI TSENG: She always is very -- looks very confident. 

 Q. Does now it mean that someone else like you is going to have to step up? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I hope so, that's my goal, be next Annika. (Smiling) But I hope she wants to come back. 

 Q. Where did you play a practise round with Annika? 
 YANI TSENG: I played in Sweden, Scandinavia. She invited me, so I was very excited. 

 Q. So Annika invited you last year to her tournament in Sweden? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yani, thanks for your time, good luck this week and we hope to see you in here.
