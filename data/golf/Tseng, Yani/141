   THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies and gentlemen. We have Yani Tseng in the interview area. Earlier this year you won your second major at Kraft Nabisco. Currently you're in the championship here on 68, finishing with the birdie on 17, eagle at 18. Congratulations. How do you feel about your round? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I played very solid today. I hit 18 greens on this golf course, so I didn't miss any greens. I putted well. 
 I feel good that I made the birdie, eagle to finish like the last two holes. The last two holes for me is very reachable. It was par holes for me. Feel okay, relaxed. I'm not trying to make a birdie, but those last two holes, just couldn't do it, and I played really solid.
 THE MODERATOR: You've won twice this season already. You must have a lot of confidence.
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. For sure, but after Kraft I didn't play really well. When I come this week, I like this golf course. 
 Actually this is my second time playing Links golf course, and I love Links. I wish we could play more on this. 
 THE MODERATOR: Why do you love Links golf courses? 
 YANI TSENG: Makes me think more. So that makes me feel focused like on every shot, trying to focus on every shot, instead of looking forward and looking back.
 THE MODERATOR: Okay. 

 Q. What sort of attention do you get when you go home? What attention do you get from people?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. I'm looking for my third major. So it will be a big crowd in Taiwan, and I think it will be big if I won another major again. Taiwan, I think the golf is getting popular in Taiwan, and I wish I could be like playing all the golf courses to getting better and better. 

 Q. Will your results be on the main news channel in Taiwan?
 YANI TSENG: I think so. I hope so. Like I start early and watch too much news in Taiwan, even though sometimes you think. So but I wish. 

 Q. Did you ever think you would hit 18 greens in regulation out here in this wind today?
 YANI TSENG: No. Actually no. On this golf course it's really tough. When we go out to play, we don't really know. You know, I really had fun today, hitting 18 greens.

 Q. Was the wind was getting less throughout the day?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, like last three holes. But it still was tough. 

 Q. Are there lots of Taiwanese journalists here?
 YANI TSENG: I think not. No. It's not like Japan. I wish we had media, like the Japan video. So when I go back to Taiwan. 

 Q. How did you start playing golf?
 YANI TSENG: My parents were always playing golf. So I started after I finished high school in Taiwan and I turned pro. 

 Q. You said already you played -- this is your second time playing Links golf?
 YANI TSENG: Yeah. First time I played was at Sunningdale. So this is the second time playing Links golf. So I play second time. I really wish we could play more Links golf. 
 THE MODERATOR: Could you go through your birdie on the fifth hole? 
 YANI TSENG: I had a 3-wood on the second shot into the bunker, and that's the only bunker I made today. And I make up and down. 
 THE MODERATOR: Okay. 17th hole.
 YANI TSENG: 17th hole was like 40 yards for birdie, I mean for for eagle.
