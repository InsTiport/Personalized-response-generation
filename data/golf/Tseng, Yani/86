 Q.   You finished 1‑under today, how was it?   
YANI TSENG:   It was bad.   I mean, I feel I hit the ball pretty good, but I just‑‑ my score was terrible and I just‑‑ I don't know why.   I didn't make putts and I didn't have much birdie chances actually.   
But I feel like I hit the driver better.   I hit some shots I was hitting better, too.   But I just need to get more consistency and trust myself and more committing to the shots.   Just made mistakes today and hopefully tomorrow will be better.  
   
 Q.   Was it more your irons or was it more on the greens that was letting down?   
YANI TSENG:   I think it was mostly committing.   I mean, I choose this club and I should just commit to it and just kind of thinking too much.  
   
 Q.   How is your elbow?   
YANI TSENG:   It's pretty good today.   It was better than yesterday.  
   
 Q.   So do you feel like you're still quite well placed at 1‑under with two more rounds?   
YANI TSENG:   Yes.
