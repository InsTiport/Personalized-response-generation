FULLAUDIOINTERVIEW

  
RHONDA GLENN: Ladies and gentlemen, you've already been welcomed  
to the 2008 United States Women's Open. My name is Rhonda  
Glenn. I'd like to say welcome, too.
  
Our guest today is Yani Tseng who is the new reigning McDonald's LPGA  
Championship. She is not a stranger to the United States Golf  
Association, because in 2004 she won the U.S. Amateur Public Links  
Championship, defeating Michelle Wie on the 36th hole of the  
finals. That was her first great national title.
  
Welcome, we're glad you're here. 
  
YANI TSENG: Thank you.
  
RHONDA GLENN: I understand you were inside the ropes at the U.S.  
Open, you watched Tiger, Phil and Adam Scott. What did you learn  
from watching Tiger that you can apply to your own game?
 YANI TSENG: I learn a lot from Tiger. Tiger -- I like Tiger's attitude. He just never give up, and play like one shot at a time. I like his power. He's very powerful.
  
RHONDA GLENN: Anything else specifically, anything in particular  
that you learned from him that you can do? 
 YANI TSENG: I can do? I can do a powerful also. I can be a good attitude. And I be like Phil, Phil is always smiling to the fans, to the people, to everybody.
  
RHONDA GLENN: What was it about Adam Scott that made you so fond  
of him? 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, he was a great looking guy. And when I saw him I almost pass out. I was so nervous to talking to him. It was like, "Hello, I'm", I can't -- I can't -- I couldn't speak. So it was really fun.
  
RHONDA GLENN: Good for you. You've won a USGA title in the  
past, and I know how much that meant to you when you won the Public  
Links Women's Championship. What would it mean to you to win the  
U.S. Women's Open? 
 YANI TSENG: I don't think about that now because I just play my one round at a time. But I will tell you after 72 holes.
  
RHONDA GLENN: Power is the strongest part of your game.  
You've been powerful since I first saw you play when you were much  
younger. That should serve you well because this is a very long  
golf course. 
 YANI TSENG: Yeah, I think that's a very good opportunity for me to hit it long and just put it on the fairway every time and to give you a chance to make a good score on this golf course.
 
  
Q. You got an up close look at 18, the par-5 at Torrey.  
How does this 18 here, do you think it will compare, as far as drama,  
excitement, coming down the stretch?
 YANI TSENG: I think it is a very good finish par-5 for me, because it's kind of a reachable par-5 for me. So it's got a very good finish and opportunity to make the birdie on the last hole. 

 
  
Q. In your practice rounds did you reach in two and what was  
your distance and what did you use to get there?
  
YANI TSENG: Yeah, I'm using my driver and 3-wood to get it on  
the green in two. 
  
But it's not into the wind. If the wind is very calm I can reach  
it in two with a 3-wood.
 
  
Q. How far do you hit it, your average? How far when you  
really hit a driver do you think you hit it?
  
YANI TSENG: I think maybe 268.
 
  
Q. 268?
  
YANI TSENG: 270. More? 270 is my average.
 
  
Q. 270?
  
YANI TSENG: Yes.
 
  
Q. How tall are you?
  
YANI TSENG: How tall? 
 
  
Q. Five six?
  
YANI TSENG: Five seven. Just put five seven.
 
  
Q. You have played a lot of golf against Michelle Wie.  
Have you seen her play lately? Why do you think she's had  
problems the last year or so?
  
YANI TSENG: You mean the last year? 
 
  
Q. Yes, last year. 
 YANI TSENG: I don't know what's her problem. I just feel maybe she need to play more tournaments in the LPGA and she need to just -- play more tournament and get more experience to play in like the big tournaments.
 
  
Q. Have you seen her play lately?
  
YANI TSENG: Yeah, just a little bit, not much.
 
  
Q. Does it look like she's back to where she was a couple of  
years ago?
  
YANI TSENG: Can you repeat again? 
 
  
Q. Is she as good as she was a couple of years ago?
 YANI TSENG: I think it's kind of a different kind of improved. And she's very friendly to me now. I think she has a great swing. I think her putting was getting much better when she play with me.
  
RHONDA GLENN: When did you play together.
  
YANI TSENG: 2004 last in the final in the Public Links.
  
RHONDA GLENN: Have you played since then? 
  
YANI TSENG: No.
 
  
Q. Where was that 2004 Public Links, where was that?
  
YANI TSENG: Williamsburg, Virginia, Golden Horseshoe.
  
RHONDA GLENN: Thank you so very much. Congratulations  
again for having won the LPGA championship and we wish you much good  
luck this week.
