Q. This has to be great to see all these people out here supporting you guys?
YANI TSENG: It's amazing.  I'm so glad the weather turns out very good today.  I'm having so much fun.  I was very close to Top-10 but I finished 3-over the last five holes, but I still enjoyed it so much.  I missed this feeling, and I really want to thank all the fans who came out today to give me great support.  I really appreciate it and I feel the nerves and I feel the pressure, but it was great pressure and good nerves.  I haven't had that for a while.
It's a good practice for me, you know and sometime when I'm a leader in the future.  It's awesome and I can't thank them enough for them to come out today.  I feel there's even more people than the last three years.  Just very appreciate it.
Q. Tell me about the eagle in the middle.  That was quite a stretch in the middle.  I'm sure the fans were all cheering for you?
YANI TSENG: They were excited and I'm excited, too.  I had a perfect hybrid for my second shot, and I think I only have nine feet for eagle and I really want to make this because I feel I want to make it for the fans, not just for myself.
But it's too bad that my putting is not really working today -- well, not today, all week, it's not really working.  Otherwise I can play so much better and I can make more birdies and make it more enjoyable for the fans.
This is golf.  Hopefully next year I'll come back and I'll play better.
Q. Like you said, maybe use this as a next step to something bigger for you.
YANI TSENG: Yes, I think it's toward the good direction.  I haven't played this well for four or five years; I've never been this good.  Even the score is not showing as much yet, but I know I'm towards to the good direction.  I know I can win.  It's just a matter of time.
