 Q.  What was going on out there today?  What made it tough to play today?  What made it tough to score?  
STEPH CURRY: The game of golf is very fickle.  And I had some trouble on the greens and probably three bad shots where I had to take a penalty.  And it's kind of how it goes.  So hopefully I'll go really, really low tomorrow and finish the week strong.  But rough day out there.   
 Q.  Last year in the final round you had the best score of the tournament.  What do you think it's going to take to get you back in the hunt where you want to be?  
STEPH CURRY: I'm going to have to birdie every hole.
