Q. Does this hole just suit you right or what, what is it?
STEPH CURRY: Knew if I played off the tee, something good could happen.  A lot of -- it's a party all the way down the fairway.  You've got the water up here.  Kind of blocked it out.  All I worry about is getting off the tee and take it from there.
Q. How far did you have in today?
STEPH CURRY: I had 160 yards.  So I just put a nice pitching wedge in my hand (indiscernible).
Q. And yesterday how far did you have?
STEPH CURRY: Yesterday was way better.  I had like 120.  Hit it like 380.  Just get on the green.  It's the only green I think I made a putt on.
Q. So you were watching pops make that putt.  What were you thinking?
STEPH CURRY: I was really upset with him that he chipped it in the water to begin with.  But in sweet Curry fashion, he knocked down a nice par about 50 feet -- 40.
Q. Did you figure out what your bet is?  Have you announced it yet?
STEPH CURRY: Not yet.  Since I think I'm down three to him right now, it's a tight race -- I spotted him 15 to start.  So he's definitely killing me.  In terms of the bet, we'll talk about it tomorrow when we get the final details.
Q. Any adjustment for you?  Didn't you give him an adjustment last year?
STEPH CURRY: No, I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I gotta go out and beat him tomorrow.
