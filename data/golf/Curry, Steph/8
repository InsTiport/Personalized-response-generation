 Q.  Dell, how cold was Lake Tahoe?  
DELL CURRY: You know what, it actually felt really good.   
 Q.  Tell us about the bet now.  
DELL CURRY: Yeah, we were sitting around the house before the tournament started, and a little friendly bet I won last year because I beat him.  So he said this year, nothing monetary, we're just going to, if you lose, whoever loses jumps in the lake.  I lost.  I paid up.   
 Q.  You're a man of your word?  
DELL CURRY: Yeah, it actually felt good.  It was nice and refreshing.   
 Q.  One quick quote about the bet with your dad.  Tell us about this bet and what do you got going for next year, have you thought it out yet?  
STEPH CURRY: Yeah, we had the Curry Battle Father/Son, whatever, competition.  Whoever lost had to jump in Lake Tahoe.  Full golf gear and everything.  So he was a man of his word, as well as his caddie, and they jumped in.   
Next year we're going to spot him just because, a handicap, we'll spot him some points and same bet next year.
