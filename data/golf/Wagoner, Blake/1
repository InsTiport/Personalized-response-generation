 Q.  How did you feel about your round today?  
BLAKE WAGONER: It was pretty good.  We did a good job of positioning ourselves in the right spots.  I was hitting it pretty well and just missed a few short putts coming in.  But it was a good day.   
 Q.  You're from around here, near Pinehurst, have you played the course before?  
BLAKE WAGONER: Yeah, I grew up playing all the courses out here Winter National events and stuff.  So I was pretty familiar with it.  But it was my first time seeing it after they redid it.   
 Q.  Do you have a favorite No. 2 or No. 4?  
BLAKE WAGONER: 4 is always my favorite course out here and I still think it is.   
 Q.  Did that help you going into today?  
BLAKE WAGONER: Probably, yeah, good vibes, play well, right?   
 Q.  Last question, any strategy changes going into tomorrow?  
BLAKE WAGONER: Yeah, 2's a lot more dicey around the greens, it's a lot more complex, so I might play a little more conservative than aggressive there, just trying to position myself in the right spots.  But, no, not too many changes.
