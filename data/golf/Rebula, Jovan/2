 Q.  Just talk about your experience here, your feeling of playing this course, and the fact that you finished well today?  
JOVAN REBULA: Yeah, I mean, in all honesty, I got in late Sunday afternoon, and Sunday I got on the golf course for the first time, you know, and it's just been magical ever since.  I got to spend a good bit of time with my uncle, had some practice rounds with him.  So always being able to spend time with your family is always special.   
And, yeah, I mean, today, I got an unbelievable pairing with two former Auburn guys, you know, which is really special.  And I don't know who to thank for that, but yeah, you know, that makes a little bit of a difference.  It's such a calm atmosphere out there, and we kept it very social and try to keep it as fun as possible, for the most part.   
So it was unbelievable.  The golf today, kept it (indiscernible).  It's just been a good day.   
 Q.  Just the experience here totally was playing Pebble Beach in the U.S. Open?  
JOVAN REBULA: Yeah, I know, you can't beat that, in all honesty.  To be able to have a chance to play in a U.S. Open, never mind Pebble Beach, that's something that words cannot describe.   
Like I said, it's truly special, and we're going to enjoy every second of this for sure.
