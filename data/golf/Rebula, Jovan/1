Q. Just talk about your experience here, your feeling of playing this course and the fact that you finished well today?
JOVAN REBULA: Yeah, I mean honestly I got in late Sunday afternoon and Sunday I got on the golf course for the first time and it's just been magical ever since.  I got to spend a good bit of time with my uncle.  I played a practice round with him.  So always being able to spend time with the family is always special.  And, yeah, today I got an unbelievable pairing, which is really special.  And I don't know who to thank for that.  But that makes a little bit of a difference.  It's such a calm atmosphere out there.  And we kept it very social and tried to keep it as fun as possible, for the most part.  It was unbelievable.  And the golf just topped it all off.  It's been a good day.
Q. The experience playing Pebble Beach in the U.S. Open?
JOVAN REBULA: Yeah, you can't beat that, in all honesty.  To be able to have a chance to play in a U.S. Open, never mind Pebble Beach, it's something that words cannot describe.  And honestly it's truly special.  And we're going to enjoy every second of this, for sure.
