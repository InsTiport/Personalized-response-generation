 Q.  Pretty steady day for you on the back nine.  What was working well and how were you able to hang in there?  
SUN YOUNG YOO: Had a long day, actually.  I didn't hit it very well.  But still, hit a lot of good shots and made a lot of putts.  It wasn't easy.  It was so windy today.  I'll take it.  I shot plus two today.   
I think I'm still in a good position for the next two days and looking forward to it.   
 Q.  How did the wind maybe affect your thought process?  
SUN YOUNG YOO: A couple thoughts I hit really good and it ended up like 30 yards behind the green, so that was a bummer.  Nothing you can do.  You can't do much about it.  So just try to enjoy it out there, and still had a lot of fun and looking forward to the next two days.
