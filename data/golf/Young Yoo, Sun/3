Q. A 69 today is really a fantastic score.  You must be really pleased as you stand here?
SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, I'm very pleased.  It wasn't easy out there.  It was windy.  Tried to make par every hole.  Didn't try too hard.  I think that worked really good.
Q. You actually collected five birdies.  Obviously there were a couple of bogey, as well, but five birdies in these conditions, it must give you real confidence heading into the weekend?
SUN YOUNG YOO: Yes, I feel really good with my game, and if I can keep doing what I did today for the next two days, then I'll be in good position.
Q. How much links golf have you played?
SUN YOUNG YOO: I think every British Open the last couple years, but it's kind of special event.  I'm not used to this very much but I enjoy it.
Q. Do you feel like you took the first day to adapt a little to the conditions and today was a result of you getting used to them?
SUN YOUNG YOO: I think so.  Yesterday was pretty much the same condition I think.  We had a little bit more rain yesterday but I expected this before I came to the golf course, so I wasn't very surprised.
