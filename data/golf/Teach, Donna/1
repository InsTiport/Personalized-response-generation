Q. What does having this tournament remain here for the next three years do for the hospital and for the kids?  We're here yesterday for them golfing.  Just the overall excitement to keep it here?
DONNA TEACH: Yeah, absolutely.  Well, I have to say on behalf of our patients, their families, and all the staff at Nationwide Children's Hospital, we could not be more excited by today's announcement.
I really can't understate the impact that this tournament has had for the children of our community and really children everywhere in terms of our ability to not only treat children with cancer, but to conduct the research that's really going to find the cures that will impact kids for generations to come.
So since 2007 and this tournament's inception, our ability to improve children's lives and to have cancer cures has significantly improved.  More than 90% of children now are surviving their cancer.  As long as there are children still out there still battling cancer, we have a lot of work to do.
We are extremely appreciative to this tournament, the Champions for the Community, the sponsors, Nationwide, the PGA, the TOUR for bringing us into this tournament and making us the beneficiary.  We're very appreciative.
Q. How about the venue and the event?  It allows these patients to interact.  They come out and are part of it.  Do they look forward to this as well?
DONNA TEACH: Right.  It's very important to note that September is actually Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month, and I think it's evident throughout this tournament.  Our kids were out here yesterday interacting with the pros and the players and with the community, and really bringing a face to what this event is all about and the impact it's going to have for kids in our community and children everywhere.
