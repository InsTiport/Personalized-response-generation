 JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  8-under par, 64.  Why don't you make a couple of comments about how the course played and the conditions out there, and then we'll come in here for a couple of questions.
GLEN HNATIUK:  Okay.  The course is great.  It's in great shape.  The greens are rolling good, and the weather conditions are perfect, obviously, just a little half-club wind at the most.  But it was a perfect day for scoring.

Q.  According to what we've got here, this is only the second time you've played this tournament, is that right?
GLEN HNATIUK: Right. 

Q.  Is this a tough tournament for somebody who hasn't played here very often in terms of local knowledge, knowing the differences in the golf courses, anything like that?
GLEN HNATIUK: Well, it is, because even when you come out with the practice rounds, it's hard to look at every course.  I'm riding around nine holes, and you have to get yourself in the birdie mode, here, and that's all there is to it and I don't make a lot of birdies. 
And I think I shot 17-under a couple of years ago when I played here, so I did okay.  And conditions are always -- or the two years I've played here, the conditions have been great.  The golf courses are good.  So it's fun.

Q.  I think we have you at 19-under a couple of years ago?
GLEN HNATIUK: Is that what it was?  Okay.  That's even better.

Q.  19-under, and I don't know what it was that year, 29 -, 30-under, something like that to win.  You say you don't make a lot of birdies, this seems to be a tournament where everybody makes a lot of birdies?
GLEN HNATIUK: Exactly, that's why you have to  -- coming into this week, you have to get yourself into that mindset.  I didn't play Hawaii, so this is the first tournament of the year for me.  So I'm still kind of shaking the rust off.  So I feel good about today's round.

Q.  Having only been here once before, do you think about course location or where you go next?
GLEN HNATIUK: Not really, because I think PGA West is probably the tougher, I think, of the four.  So other than that, you know, you try and shoot -- obviously try to shoot as low as you can all the time, but try to shoot a decent score up there, and really try to go low on the others. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Could you go over your birdies and bogeys, starting with No. 1.
GLEN HNATIUK:  Let's see, No. 1, I think I made about a -- par-5, made a two-footer for birdie there. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  3?
GLEN HNATIUK:  3, I made about a 4-footer there. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  The club you used on the par-3, No. 4, and how close were you to the pin.
GLEN HNATIUK:  4-iron, and I hit it about a foot and a half.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  The next par-3.
GLEN HNATIUK:  The next par-3, I hit 6-iron, about eight inches.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Par-5, No. 8.
GLEN HNATIUK:  I hit a sand wedge, and it was probably two feet. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  The bogey on 9.
GLEN HNATIUK:  Bogey on 9, I hit a 9-iron on the front fringe and hit a really poor chip, had an easy chip, and didn't get up-and-down. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  And par-3, No. 12.
GLEN HNATIUK:  12 ,I hit a 7-iron, I hit that about two feet. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  16, par-4.
GLEN HNATIUK:  16, par-4, I hit a 6-iron about ten feet. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  17?
GLEN HNATIUK:  17, I hit 4-iron about 20 feet. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  18?
GLEN HNATIUK:  18 ,I was chipping from behind the green, and I chipped up about ten feet. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Well, we appreciate your time and play well the rest of the week.
