Q. 67, how does it feel?
JOÃL STALTER: Feels great.  Played real solid today.   Didn't have a bogey.  Had a few chances on the back nine that didn't go in and saved a couple pars, so it was really good.  I'm really happy.
Q. Was it just a case on the back nine of missed putts or what's the deal with no birdies out there?
JOÃL STALTER: I missed a couple fairways and I had a few opportunities and the putt didn't drop, but finished with a nice birdie on 18, so that's really good.
Q. How far was the birdie on 18?
JOÃL STALTER: Six feet.
Q. Thoughts overall?
JOÃL STALTER: Really, it's a good start.  It's not a very easy course.  If you lay well, you'll score.  But if you don't play well, it will be pretty tough.  So I'm really happy and I look forward to getting going.
