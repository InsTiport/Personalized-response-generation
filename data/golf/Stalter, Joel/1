 Q.  Can you tell me about the round a little bit?  
JOÃL STALTER: Yeah, I played very, very well.  It was windy.  It's my first time here.  People say the cut is low, blah, blah, blah; I think it's playing really tough.  It's cold, so it was tough at the beginning to get into the round, and you were waiting a lot.  So you get cold, and I played really well.  Started really well and I played well on the back nine.  Had a nice 4-under.   
 Q.  It's usually very low scores.  Is it just the wind?  
JOÃL STALTER: Yeah, it's very windy.  The back nine played really long, and 17, I hit driver, 2-iron, and usually it's the opposite wind and you have a wedge in your hand.  So it's just links golf; the weather dictates the scores.   
I played really solid.  I'm very happy with my round.   
 Q.  Enjoying the tournament so far?  First time?  
JOÃL STALTER: Yeah, it's good.  I'm lucky.  I have a really nice amateur.  They play fast, as well, which is nice.  They respect us and they know we are playing for -- it's a big tournament for us, so it's really nice to see that, as well.
