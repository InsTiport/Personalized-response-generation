Q. You ended up shooting 66 today; how do you feel coming off the course?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: Pretty good.  I made bogey on 17, but other than that, it felt like a really good day today.
Q. You had four birdies right in a row, 12 through 15?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: Yeah, that was -- yeah, the putter felt really good in my hands on those holes.  I wasn't really too worried about anything, just kind of lining them up and stroking them in.
Q. About how long were those putts?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: I had a tap-in on 12.  I had about five feet on 13.  Had probably a little over 20 feet on 14.  Had about 10 feet on 15.
Q. So a wide range?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: Yeah.
Q. What are your thoughts on the North Course today?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: Oh, the rough is really thick.  If you don't hit the fairway, you're not going to hit the green pretty much.  Really I was putting an emphasis on driving before the round, and I drove it really well today.
Q. How do you feel going into tomorrow, different course, South Course?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: Yeah, I'm excited.  I haven't played the front nine on the South Course yet, so I'm really looking forward to getting out there, and Ian will guide me around well.  I'm really excited to go.
Q. Is Ian a local caddie here?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: Yeah, he is.
Q. Is this your first time playing in the Amateur?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: Uh-huh.
Q. What's it feel like to make it to the U.S. Amateur?
BEN SCHLOTTMAN: Yeah, I mean, honestly it's like such a big event that I just have zero expectations at all.  I just want to come out here and have fun.
