Q.   2‑under par to start this tournament, that's some going, isn't it? 
FRANKIE MINOZA:   Yeah, I started, bogeyed, birdied, 3‑putted the third hole but birdied the next holes and made some birdies coming in. 

Q.   That's a superb bounce back because anything could have happened after that start?
FRANKIE MINOZA:   Yeah, but I stayed patient today.   I'm still learning how to play the links course. 

Q.   Well, you have played this links course in the past, haven't you, when you played The Open Championship, you played at Royal Birkdale?
FRANKIE MINOZA:   Yeah, I played here once, but I can't remember No.2 it, No. 3.   I like the way I finished today. 

Q.   And when you were playing, did anything come to mind?   Were you thinking at all about the previous one?   Could anything come back to memory? 
FRANKIE MINOZA:   No, I just go out there and play shot‑to‑shot, hole‑by‑hole.

Q.   So what was it on the back nine?   What works?
FRANKIE MINOZA:   I hit the ball very good on the back nine.   I think I birdied 10, 14, 15, 16, 18. 

Q.   Were you conscious of leaderboards at that stage? 
FRANKIE MINOZA:   No, not at all. 

Q.   Doesn't really matter on the first day but you find yourself in the lead in the championship now. 
FRANKIE MINOZA:   It's nice to be there. 

Q.   How has your game been?
FRANKIE MINOZA:   I've been playing all right the last few months.

Q.   But this is so different, isn't it, playing links golf?
FRANKIE MINOZA:   Yeah, it is a big difference.   If you're playing this kind of weather and then the links course, you never know. 

Q.   Do you like the creativity that's involved? 
FRANKIE MINOZA:   Yeah, I like it because you have to learn how to hit the ball low, how to hit a high ball, how to putt 50 yards off the green.
