 Q.  Another solid round from you today.  How was it? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  Very good today.  I hit the ball very solid today.  Well, this course here, you can make birdies and you can make birdies, also. 

 Q.  What was the highlight of the round for you? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  My highlight is I birdied 3, 13, 15, 16, and I birdied 18. 

 Q.  Great finish to another great round.  What are your thoughts heading into the weekend? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  Just playing my normal game.  Just keep the ball, playing shot-by-shot and hole-by-hole and see what happens. 

 Q.  Is that your game plan for this week? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  Yes. 

 Q.  We haven't seen you for quite a while and a lot's been happening since we last saw you.  First of all, the win in Japan, fantastic.  You said to me at the beginning of the year when you won in the Philippines, "At my age, I can't believe it."  How did it feel to win in Japan? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  You know, that's my dream, you know, before I reach 50.  My ambition is to win two tournaments in one year, and I did it this year. 

 Q.  So how does it feel to come to the HSBC, which is obviously a great tournament, how does it feel to come along here and be at such a big event, three of you this year? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  I was so happy -- I was trying to hard to win tournaments. 
 So hopefully I'll do better on the last two days. 

 Q.  Have you really focused on this tournament since the beginning of the year, have you been thinking about the HSBC? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  I wasn't thinking so much about this tournament, but after I won the Asian Open, I started to think about it.  It's been a pleasure to be here. 

 Q.  Do you change your preparation at all coming to China? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  No, no.  Just exactly the same, same everything. 

 Q.  At the beginning of the year you were really working on that inside move with your coach, how is that going? 
 FRANKIE MINOZA:  It works.  You know, I've been working so hard and even now, I'm still working.
