Q. A bit mixed in comparison to yesterday?
GARY EVANS:  It was a tough day. I am not playing particularly well at the minute. I know 65 at St Andrews looks like I am playing well, but I only played okay. Today was a bit scrappy. The swing didn't feel very good. I wasn't releasing the club very well on the downswing but I ground it out and I am very, very happy with a 71 today. It could have easily gone to 74 or 75. It is always nice to come off that course without dropping any. I played it the wrong way around and to open up with two bogeys in the first three holes is not the best way to start.
Q. Your plan for tomorrow?
GARY EVANS:  I need to get to the range early tomorrow and try to get some rhythm in my swing. Then I need to be positive. If I could shoot three under at Kingsbarns to be ten under after three rounds, I won't be too far away. I think the scoring so far is amazing. Anyone in double figures has played very well. Bradley has played serious golf to be 12-under after St Andrews and Carnoustie, two of the best courses you will ever play and not in the best weather conditions.
