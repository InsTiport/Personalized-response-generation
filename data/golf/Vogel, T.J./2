Q.   Kind of sum up your week and your day today. 
T.J. VOGEL:   Well, it was a heck of an experience to be able to play here and obviously I wanted to make the cut and do a little bit better, but I still really enjoyed myself out there.   I had a blast.

Q.   Did you have any like good memories that stand out more than any other?
T.J. VOGEL:   Well, that putt on 17 felt really good.   I just couldn't really get anything going and it was like, finally, and then the crowd erupted for me.   So that was pretty cool. 
I don't know, just spending the whole week with my dad on the bag and just playing in front of the crowd, it's just been a dream come true. 

Q.   Are you going to stay?
T.J. VOGEL:   Yeah, definitely going to stay and watch some people and I made some friends out here now, so it's really cool, so I'm going to go watch them.
