 Q.  Well, it took a little while to get it finished, but it did get it done and came in pretty strong. 
 TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, we're done.  It's going to be an interesting day, see if we can hopefully get the next round completed today.  That would be nice. 
 But I shot a good score this morning, went out there and shot under par this morning, which I wanted to do.  We'll head back out in, I guess about an hour and a half and let's go. 

 Q.  Are you going to go back into the locker room and just kind of chill for a little bit and then go through your warmup routine again, or are you just going to try and stay warm before you go out? 
 TIGER WOODS:  No, I'm going to go eat.  I'm going to go get my second breakfast of the morning. 

 Q.  You said something last night that threw us all off after the round was done.  You said you were going to go work out before you ate.  Did you workout last night? 
 TIGER WOODS:  Yeah. 

 Q.  Did you have time to eat? 
 TIGER WOODS:  I did.  I ate plenty.  I just wanted to make sure my body was ready for today because it was going to be a long day.
