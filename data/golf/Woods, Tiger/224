  TIGER WOODS:   It happened on the 2nd hole when I hit my second shot, I fell back into the bunker.   I just jarred it, and it's been spasming ever since.  
   
 Q.   Same spot, same location as before?   
TIGER WOODS:   It's just the whole lower back.   I don't know what happened.  
   
 Q.   It's something you tried to play through and it got progressively worse?   
TIGER WOODS:   Exactly.  
   
 Q.   Any indication what it might mean for next week?   
TIGER WOODS:   I don't know.   Just trying to get out of here.
