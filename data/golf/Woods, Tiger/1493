Q. Thoughts on your round today.
 
TIGER WOODS:  I hit a lot of shots up there, lost some chances to make some shots and really get it going, never did.  And then with the -- with the debacle at 18, it's not exactly how I wanted to end the round. 
 

Q. You got pretty close to the green.  That's unfortunate.  Seems like an aggressive day, though, compared to yesterday or the day before, a lot of people -- John Cook, obviously -- was it an aggressive day for you?
 
TIGER WOODS:  The golf course could be had today because the greens were pretty smooth, very soft.  If you're on with your iron game, obviously, you're going to hit the ball pretty close. 
 

Q. Are the greens -- I see some spikemarks.  Is that a factor?
 
TIGER WOODS:  Huge factor.  A lot more spikemarks than you think. 
 

Q. Thanks for your time, Tiger.
 
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah.
