Q.  Are you ready to play?
TIGER WOODS:  We're excited, both of us.  We have got two of Europe's best on the first day, so it will be a fun match and hopefully we'll be able to get it started and get the momentum on our side going out early.
Q.  Pleased with your pairing?
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, we've played a bunch, Paddy and Colin and I; that's nothing new.
