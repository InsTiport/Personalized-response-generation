 Q.   Talk about the rain, going in and out like that, when you have so much momentum but you're playing well?   
TIGER WOODS:   We are playing well, both of us are playing well.   I hit a couple loose iron shots this afternoon, but made a couple good putts and just kind of put the heat on these guys, 7‑under through 11, that's not bad alternate‑shot.  
It's just one of those days where both teams are really playing well, and still got our work cut out for us tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Kind of the temperature of the match and where you guys were when you finished?   
MATT KUCHAR:   It was really dark so we said let's come back tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   And you had the lead since the start, do you feel you guys are playing pretty well together again?   
MATT KUCHAR:   We had a great day.   7‑under through 11 was just incredible golf, hard to believe that these guys are really giving us a great match, they are playing good golf as well.   Been a fun match and it's been fun for me to have Tiger as a partner.   Some of the shots into the par 5s, he's hit some incredible fairway woods into the par 5s and making my job pretty easy.  
   
 Q.   Hard to stop when the momentum is going that way?   
MATT KUCHAR:   I think we are pretty good at coming back.     It's part of what we do on the PGA TOUR and you get used to a lot of these delays and weather delays.
