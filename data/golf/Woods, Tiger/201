Q. We are with Tiger Woods.  How would you describe the way it was out there for you today?TIGER WOODS: I didn't get much out of today's round.  It's probably the highest score I could have shot today, so that's probably the only positive thing.Q. We were just discussing, since they've moved THE PLAYERS from March to May, the wind has always been the opposite way it used to be early in your career.  Today it was like a March wind being a little cooler than the May conditions.  What was that like out there for you?TIGER WOODS: Only difference was we didn't have to wear sweaters.  In March you can get some pretty cold temperatures down here.  I've played here in the 30s.  But today was just a north wind that just blew pretty much all day.  It was supposed to be out of the northwest starting out and then it turned out of the northeast, which it did.
