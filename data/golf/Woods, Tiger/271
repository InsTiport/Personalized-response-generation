Q.   You guys fought back, maybe a couple comments? 
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, we had a chance, we took it to 18 and at least we had a chance to get a halve out of it but we didn't. 

Q.   Made a pretty good putt there?
TIGER WOODS:   I hit a good putt and Ernie hit a beautiful putt in there. 

Q.   How far was Ernie's do you think? 
TIGER WOODS:   It was about 6 1/2 feet. 

Q.   You guys were down heading into today but fought back and got close, got two and then close on 17.   Thoughts about the finish this morning? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, had a great comeback.   Those guys played great.   Brendon de Jonge particularly was playing some good golf.   Tiger was pulling out some of the heroic shots.   He was an awesome partner; that shot he hit on 15 was just incredible, to make eagle to kind of get one back.   Got lucky for Brendon to finally miss a shot on 16, and Tiger stuffed it on 17 and had a great chance to pull the match to even and came up a little bit on the low side there. 

Q.   And you're playing Marc Leishman in singles; obviously you guys know him, what do you know about his game? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Fantastic player.   Hits it high and a bit of a cut.   Played well early this week.   We had him in a match and he was playing some really solid golf.
