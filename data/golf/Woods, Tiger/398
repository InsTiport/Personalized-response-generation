Q.   Was the birdie on 9 a critical moment? 
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I was 3‑over par.   I wasn't playing very good.   I didn't hit any good shots, and I just made two bogeys back‑to‑back from the middle of the fairway.   So I needed to get back in the tournament.   I'm within reach.   I have to probably shoot 63 or 64 tomorrow to have a chance.

Q.   I saw you wiggling your left leg a little bit.   Are you okay? 
TIGER WOODS:   No, those shots didn't feel very good, those awkward shots.   My knee doesn't like that position, so that's kind of the way it goes. 

Q.   How do you feel about today?
TIGER WOODS:   I grinded hard.   I didn't have much, and on top of that I made two really bad bogeys on 7 and 8 from the middle of the fairway, but at least I fought back where I have a chance going into tomorrow.   It's probably going to take 63 or 64 tomorrow, but it can be done out here.   The golf course is soft, and they've got some pretty easy pins out there tomorrow.

Q.   Talk about the 9th hole, that pitch‑in and your reaction to it. 
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I had a simple 4‑iron, and I was trying to leave it in the right bunker, and I hit it about 30 yards left of where I wanted to put it, and then all of a sudden I have an impossible shot, just try to get it anywhere around for a putt or a chip, and I drew a nice lie there and chipped it in.

Q.   You have to have one good day in you, don't you?
TIGER WOODS:   You would think.   You would think.   I'm just trying to scrap it around out there.   I'm just waiting for that one good ball‑striking day, and with the way I'm chipping and putting right now, it can be done, I just need to do it.
