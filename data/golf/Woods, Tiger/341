 Q.   Close once again but couldn't get anything going early on.   
TIGER WOODS:   No, I had a hard time getting accustomed to the speed.   The speed was so much slower than it was yesterday, and that was before it rained.   Then they changed pretty dramatically.   I struggled hitting putts hard enough.   Every putt I left short for probably the first eight holes.  
   
 Q.   How different did the course play with the rain than it did the last three days?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, chip shots were skidding; approach shots if you flighted them would skid; throw them up, they would spin.   And the greens were so much slower, the putts just weren't rolling out.   
   
 Q.   What were the things you felt like you had to do today that you just were not able to accomplish?   
TIGER WOODS:   Shoot 65.   
   
 Q.   Was that your number?  
TIGER WOODS:   That was the number.   I thought 10 would win it outright.  
   
 Q.   How would you overall assess this week for you, positively?  
TIGER WOODS:   I played well, unfortunately I just didn't make enough putts and also missed a few shots here and there.   I certainly had an opportunity today.   If I shot 65 I thought I could win it outright, and it looked like that might be the number.
