Q. Tiger, heck of a finish there with three straight to wrap up your opening round.  How big was that to get in the clubhouse with that momentum?TIGER WOODS: I played so much better than being 1-under par at the time, after making a stupid double bogey at 6.  I was hitting the ball too well, giving myself so many opportunities, capitalizing on hardly anything, but felt like if we could get it back to 3 would be great, and I happened to pull off a hat trick coming in.Q. And this is your best opening round since BMW Championship a couple years ago.  From a big picture standpoint to see positive results like that, what will that do for you going forward?TIGER WOODS: Well, I felt like I wasn't very far away.  I know people think I'm crazy for saying that, but I just felt like I wasn't that far.  I just had to make a couple little tweaks, and I felt like I pulled that off.Q. It looked like in the pro-am on Wednesday, you were hitting the driver great.  That had been an issue for you the previous couple months.  It carried over to today.  What's been clicking for you?TIGER WOODS: Well, just the overall pattern shift that we made.  It started at Memorial, making a big change there, and then it's just finally starting to click in now.Q. How close do you think you are?TIGER WOODS: Very close.
