 Q. What is it about this pairing that works so well? 
 STEVE STRICKER: I don't know. We are trying not to think about it I guess. We are comfortable with one another and I think that's the biggest thing. Our games complement each other nicely. I try to get him in the fairway and he hits some unbelievable iron shots, and fortunately I've been knocking a couple of the putts in, and vice versa.
 We gel well together and hopefully we can do it some more. 

 Q. We had you at 6-under par in alternate-shot, pretty good. How would you like to have this guy putting for you, every day. 
 TIGER WOODS: It's not a bad deal, is it? His stroke is so good. It's fun to watch. All you have to do is put him in position, and he's got that go-in look. Even putts that don't go in, it's like, how did that miss.
