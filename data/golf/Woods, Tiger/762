 Q. It was a day where you came so close it seemed throughout the day. You've talked often about patience, how important that is here, and it really seemed to test your patience today. 
 TIGER WOODS: It did, it really did. Today was probably the highest score I could have probably shot. 68 was probably as high as I could go. I hit the ball well all day, hit a lot of good putts that didn't quite have the right speed or the right line. It was just a touch off, and you're going to pay the price.

 Q. And then you came to the 17th and a brilliant second shot. 
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I could read that one (laughing). It wasn't too bad. I think it was straight in from there.

 Q. And then 18, tee shot into the trees, and then your second shot. 
 TIGER WOODS: Well, the second shot I just had to fit it. I had 180 to the hole and I had to hit the right traj as well as the right line, and I said, you know what, either you're making 6 or you're making 4, one of the two. Let's go ahead and try to make 4 here.

 Q. Did you do enough and do what you wanted to do to maintain contact and make a run tomorrow?
 TIGER WOODS: There's no doubt. I put myself right back in the tournament. As I said, this was as high a score as I could have shot today, and if I have a few more putts go in I'm right there, but I'm still right there anyways.
