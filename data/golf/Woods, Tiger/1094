Q.
Would you identify putting as the key to this match?
TIGER WOODS:  No doubt about that.  I didn't make the putts.
Q.  You were so much longer off the tee.  I thought if anything, I would have thought with the course so long, that would be really intimidating.
TIGER WOODS:  You just have to go ahead and plod along, and that's what Nick does.  He's very consistent, very solid.  He has an amazing short game.  And I didn't make a lot of mistakes.  The difference is that he made enough birdies to win the match.
Q.  Were there times you felt like you had a chance to change the momentum?
TIGER WOODS:  I thought if I could get to 18 somehow, I would have had the advantage on 18, but I just didn't quite get it done.
Q.  Tee shot on 17, didn't knock it on the fairway?
TIGER WOODS:  It wasn't too bad.  I was in the first cut, so it wasn't too bad.  He had a wonderful shot underneath the trees.  It forced me to have to go for it, and I didn't hit a very good shot.
Q.  How difficult was it getting down early in the match?
TIGER WOODS:  With the greens not being so good it's hard.  And I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in, a lot of lip outs.  That was certainly the difference in winning and losing a match.  Nick made all the putts that he was in position to make and I didn't.
Q.  Were the greens better today?
TIGER WOODS:  I hit good putts and you could see them bounce a little bit.  You've got to hit and hope.  I hit good putts where I was looking.

The one poor putt I hit was on the second par 3, I hit it too hard and it lipped out.  All in all, I thought I hit really good putts, but nothing went in.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  Well, when you play 18 holes it's a lot like a sprint and anything can happen on 18 holes.  We certainly have seen that over the years.
