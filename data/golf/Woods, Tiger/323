  TIGER WOODS:   It's going to be a fast night.   
   
 Q.   What about today with all the waiting around, what did you have to go through mentally and your starting and stopping again?  
TIGER WOODS:   It's kind of the way the Tour has been this year.   We've had a lot of bad weather this year and this is the way it's been.   
I've got a lot of holes to play tomorrow.   And hopefully I can play a little better than I did today.
