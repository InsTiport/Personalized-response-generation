Q. When did the back start acting up?TIGER WOODS: I guess between those two suspension.  When we had that break. It just never loosened back up again.  And when we went back out, it just got progressively tighter.Q. Did you consider not playing?TIGER WOODS: What's that?Q. Did you consider not playing?TIGER WOODS: No.Q. How frustrating is this for you, considering everything that you've been through with your back?TIGER WOODS: It's frustrating that it started shutting down like that.  I was ready to go.  I had a good warm-up session the first time around. Then we stood out here and I got cold, and everything started deactivating again.  And it's frustrating that I just can't stay activated.  That's just kind of the way it is.Q. Is this new for you since your comeback?TIGER WOODS: Yeah, very.  This is -- usually don't have to wait like this.  When I'm at home practicing I keep going, keep going, this is different.Q. Same pain or a different pain?TIGER WOODS: It's just my glutes are shutting off.  Then they don't activate and then, hence, it goes into my lower back. So, I tried to activate my glutes as best I could, in between, but it just they never stayed activated.Q. When did you first feel it?TIGER WOODS: Whenever we were standing there on the putting green to see if we were going to go play or not.  And I tried to activate it before we went back out, but it just never did.
