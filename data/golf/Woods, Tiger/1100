Q.
You guys never like to take a break, but when you're playing as well as you were before the fog rolls in, what did you do during the break to make sure you kept yourself in check so you could play well afterwards?
TIGER WOODS:  As I said earlier in the week, I didn't quite feel my best, so I went back to the room and crashed.

And made sure that Stevie was awake enough where he could keep calling, see what the times were doing.
Q.  You lost 7 pounds, early in the week.  How are you feeling right now, a little health update?
TIGER WOODS:  I'm feeling better, feeling stronger, I just don't have my energy back or my stamina, because I lost so much weight so fast.

It's going to take a little time before I put that weight back
Q.
You're 11-under, where would you be if you were healthy?
TIGER WOODS:  I'll take right where I'm at.
