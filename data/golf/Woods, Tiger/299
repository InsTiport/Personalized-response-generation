  CHRIS REIMER:   Just talk about being back here and the start of the FedExCup Playoffs.
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I'm excited, good to be back, and the golf course is obviously very different than the last time we played it.   It's not only they made a bunch of changes but it's really dried out.   The last time we played it, it was certainly not that way with the weather. 
The greens were really getting some speed to them and the fairways were giving it up, so it's going to be a heck of a test. 

Q.   Do you think the improvements they have made are pretty good? 
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, they made some really nice improvements.   Some of the landing areas have been changed.   Some of the greens have been changed, and a couple bunkers have been repositioned, but they have made some really nice, positive improvements. 

Q.   Only played the back nine ‑‑
TIGER WOODS:   My neck and back are a little bit stiff, it was stiff this morning after a soft bed and just one of those things, sleeping in hotels and I didn't want to push it, so just took it easy and chipped and putted. 

Q.   After the PGA, you said that wasn't a long‑term issue for you; are you more concerned now?
TIGER WOODS:   No, it was fine at home.   Hotel beds. 

Q.   Get a new bed? 
TIGER WOODS:   What do you think. 

Q.   Have one shipped?   Can they do that for you? 
TIGER WOODS:   I don't know.   We'll have something (smiling).

Q.   Don't you get ‑‑ with Marriott points where you can get an upgrade?
TIGER WOODS:   You would think, wouldn't you, all the travel we do.

Q.   What do you think, this weekend, from the fan's point of view, a referendum to see who is going to have the best year, there's a couple of you guys, do you think this might settle this debate a little bit? 
TIGER WOODS:   Well, the Playoffs, the way they have been structured are different. 
So you could win, theoretically, you can win every tournament of the year and not be the FedEx champion.   I mean, whoever is in the top five, whoever wins that event, wins the FedExCup. 
So it will be interesting to see what happens.   You're basically playing for the top five positioning going into the TOUR Championship, win it, and that will assure you being the champion of the Playoffs.

Q.   Has that whole thing grown on you, the whole FedExCup?
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, it has, but it's obviously changed its shape.   I think the first couple years when Vijay and I won it, we didn't really have to play THE TOUR Championship, and that's obviously been changed and altered.   The way the points are structured, as I said, you're just playing for positioning in the Top‑5‑‑ until you get a Top‑5, will win the whole thing.

Q.   Has your assessment of your year changed, depending on how you do, not just this week, but in the Playoffs? 
TIGER WOODS:   I think the overall package is how I look at it.   This year's been a great year so far.   I've won at two of my favorite venues, plus winning two World Golf Championships and a PLAYERS in there, it's been pretty good (smiling).

Q.   What does getting to 80 rank on your career resumÃ©, and if you get near a hundred, where would that eventually rank?
TIGER WOODS:   I tell you what, I never thought I would ever get there this quick.   It's been an amazing, amazing run to get here.   The consistency of one of the things I'm most proud of is winning five or more tournaments, ten years in there, that's one of the stats that I look at as one of the ones I'm really proud of.   This is one of those years. 

Q.   Is it something that's more or less grown on you, the more you win and the closer you get to a hundred, I know 14 major championships are what you measure yourself off of but is this maybe growing in your eyes? 
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I'm second on all time list on both, whether it's Majors or all time wins.   That's not bad at my age.   Both of those guys took a lot longer to get to that point, and to do it, where I'm at right now, it pretty good. 

Q.   Is the season better with six titles full‑stop, or none of those and one major, which season for you is better? 
TIGER WOODS:   I think the major, yeah.   I mean, you can‑‑

Q.   The rest of the season doesn't take away from what you accomplished? 
TIGER WOODS:   Not at all.

Q.   It's just so important to get back to winning?
TIGER WOODS:   It's nice to win golf tournaments and as I said, it's over the course of a career.   It's not just one year.   You're looking over a course of a career, and you're going to have years where you don't win major championships and years that you do.   There's years where I've won one tournament and years where I've won nine.   So as long as I keep winning in all those years, it's not too bad.

Q.   So you have had a great year, but I talk to people who say, 'except by Tiger's standards,' it's the only way that it can be judged as less an a great year; what do you think of that standard?
TIGER WOODS:   My standards, it's a great year. 

Q.   Where does Player of the Year fit in, if you were to win, what would it mean? 
TIGER WOODS:   It does, it would mean a lot.   That's voted on by the players, so when you get the respect and the hats‑off by your peers, that's something that we don't take lightly.   We take that, as pretty prideful and any time you get the respect and honor of your peers, it means something even more special.

Q.   Who would you put up there as your other great contenders for that honor this season?
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I think obviously Phil is up there.   Kuch has won a couple times.   Who else has won a couple‑‑ Sneds.   Obviously this run, any of those guys wins, hypothetically, wins all four, you know, you're looking at a four, five‑, six‑win season, and that's a pretty good season. 

Q.   With so much emphasis on Majors through the year, you've won a couple FedExCups‑‑ what would that do for you this year? 
TIGER WOODS:   Certainly it's different because earlier in my career, it doesn't exist.   It was all about the money title and whether or not you could win the money title.   This is a version of that. 
Any time you can add up and have the most points at the end of the year, it's a pretty good year. 

Q.   Great year?
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah. 

Q.   Going back to the course, which hole do you think could be the biggest challenge? 
TIGER WOODS:   Well, there's quite a few of them.   I mean, each one's different in its own right.   But I think coming down 18 with a chance, it's easier than what it used to be.   We had the same tee box but it's 30 yards up now. 
It's a hole in which I remember hitting driver, 4‑iron to this thing, and a lot of the guys I was playing with were hitting driver, hybrids, things of that nature, because it was wet, ball wasn't rolling, long hole.   It's still 500 yards, and a 500‑yard finishing hole is always a good hole.
