  TIGER WOODS:   I just hit a bad iron shot there at 4 and didn't get up‑and‑down.   
And 9 I was completely blocked out and tried to shape one over there and I drew no lie at all from my third shot.   And I was just trying to play 20feet long and putt back and try and just get bogey.   I didn't even get over the bunker.   Came out nowhere.   Didn't really have much from there, hit a beautiful putt, just lipped out.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, a little bit.   You know, I hit some good shots there, stuffed it at 2, tricky little putt.   Probably should have taken a little bit longer, but we were on the clock and had to get going, so ended up blocking the putt anyways down the hill.   
Hit a good shot at 3, 2‑putted there.   
And 4 was just one of those holes where I laid up and caught the tree.   It was supposed to be way down there and it just happened to get through there, but it didn't and stuck a 9‑iron into the ground.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, it all depends on what kind of lie you get.   If you can get it down grain where it's not so bad, I happened to get one where it was settled down and into the grain at the same time.   
As I said, I was just trying to play 20feet long and putt back and get my bogey and get out of there.   If I happen to make a 20‑footer, so be it.   But it came out nowhere and I didn't get over the bunker.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   I was in the first cut.   
   
 Q.   Were you surprised at all‑‑ (inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   No, I mean, when we first went out there the first maybe hour there was no wind.   On top of that with the rain here, it softened everything up.   There was never any danger of a ball rolling past your number that you were going to land it at.   No ball is going to bounce over the back if you drove the ball in the fairway.   If you drove it in the rough‑‑ you know, Davis and Keegan today hit a few tee shots in the rough and were able to get it on the green.   We weren't exactly able to do this in practice rounds, so that rain certainly helped things.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   I'm still right there.   I mean, I'm‑‑ as of right now, I'm only six back and we have got a long way to go.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   A little bit.   We were put on the clock on the first hole so we had to get going and try to close up the gap.   It would have been nice to take a little bit longer on that putt.   It was a pretty tricky little putt.   Looking from behind the ball, it looked like it was going to snap.   Looking from behind the hole, it looked like it wasn't going to snap.   I ended up playing it somewhere in between and then blocked it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, if I land it on top, it's out of here, it's in the rough.   If you hit it up the left side, you are blocked out by the tree.   I mean, Keegan drove it in the first cut and he was a little bit blocked out and had to try to send one around and ended up catching the hill and kicking way left.  
It's only 280 on top.   The tee was up.   If it lands on top of the hill, straight ball down the middle of the fairway is going to be in the rough.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   I was trying to land it on the front edge, that's it.   If it happens to get to the front edge, so be it.   I had 225 front, hit a 4‑iron and it was‑‑ I had to hit a really good 4‑iron to get there.   If I didn't, make sure I missed it short left somewhere, left rough, left bunker or up the gut where I left it just so I had an angle at that flag.  
   
 Q.   You ended up getting on the clock.   Do you block that out?   
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, we have to be conscious of it, but we play just about every week like that.   So that's nothing unusual.   We have a lot of people following us and a lot of cameras going off and movement inside the galleries.   We have a tendency of having that happen and we're accustomed to it.   It happens.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   A little bit.   I played really well today.   As I said, just a couple‑‑ you know, one loose 9‑iron in there and ended up not having much of a shot.   On the second shot after a decent tee shot on 9, I made a few par putts out there, as well.   
The round realistically could have been under par easily.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you had the momentum on the back?   
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, as I say, I feel like I played well today and made some nice key putts and the key isI left it in all the good spots too.   Left it right where I wanted to leave them, so I had some free runs at putts, especially the par putts.   
   
 Q.   How long were you on the clock?  
TIGER WOODS:   1 through 4.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   No, no.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
TIGER WOODS:   I just heard it now, so‑‑
