Q. What a different experience this must have been for you not playing, but being one of assistant captains.  What did you learn this week?
TIGER WOODS: No, we were a team.  Whether I was playing or not, I was part of a team.  Our team won.
Q. What is the difference playing for pride versus playing for money, which is what you guys do each and every other week?
TIGER WOODS: I'm still playing for pride, whether I'm playing for money or not.  I take pride in the work I do out there.  This is no exception.  Whether there's cash involved or not, you are always playing for pride.
Q. How much were you involved with everything?  It seemed like you were very into it from the outside looking in, and the guys kept recognizing what you were doing.  What were your contributions here for the team this week?
TIGER WOODS: I was trying to do my role.  My role was to help the team however possible, and I hope I've done that.
