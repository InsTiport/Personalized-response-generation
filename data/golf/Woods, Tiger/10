Q. Just general thoughts on -- it was a rough finish, but how the course was playing and what was the strongest part of the challenge?
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, the course was fine.  The course is in perfect shape.  Not the way I wanted to finish, but the golf course is playing difficult for sure.
Q. Was it a challenge dealing with the heat?  Did that wear you out at all?
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I live in Florida, so it's hot.  This is no different.  Certainly it was hot early.  The wind picked up and it wasn't bad.  It's just a little muggy.
Q. Obviously there's so much talk about racial injustice, and the NBA and MLB had some teams that didn't play.  Was there any thought at all to not playing this round?
TIGER WOODS:   No, I talked to the commissioner and they were on board.  Obviously he released his statement, and all the guys were on board.  So no, obviously there was talk about it because of obviously what happened, but we're all on board, on the same page.
