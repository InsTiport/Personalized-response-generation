Q. How do you describe this team and the team unity here?
TIGER WOODS: This team is fantastic, a bunch of young guys.  They already have played junior golf, college golf, and obviously early part of their pro career together.  It was very simple for us to putt the teams together.  They bonded really well, and on top of that, they really played their butts off this week.
Q. As someone who has clinched many of these points, what is it like for Daniel to get that winning point for the team?
TIGER WOODS: I think it's fantastic.  He played so hard.  Every time his name was called, he played hard, got points.  Today he really hit the golf ball well.  Made some really crucial putts, chipped in there at 11, and it was just a really solid effort.  I'm really proud of him.
Q. What has this overall experience been like for you this week?
TIGER WOODS: For me it's been fantastic.  It's neat because our captain and all of our assistants, I've played in team matches with them, going all the way back to '98.  To us, it's a lot of fun because we've known each other for 20-plus years, and for us to go ahead and do what we did this week, these young guys really did it for us.
