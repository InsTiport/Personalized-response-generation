Q.   The 13th hole is when I noticed the second shot into the par5 that just sent shivers through your back, what happened there?
TIGER WOODS:   Well, it actually started the hole before, my little tee shot there, started it, and 13 just kind of accentuated it. 

Q.   Like a back spasm? 
TIGER WOODS:   Oh, yeah, big time.   It's definitely spasming.

Q.   And then you battled back, you had the last three holes, birdie on 16, birdie on 17; 18, you had a great look. 
TIGER WOODS:   I had a chance.   I don't know how I hit that 8‑iron that far, and I had 90 total and flew it almost to the flag, so a bit surprised by that.   But I hit a good putt.   Thought I made it.   It was a little double‑breaker and I thought I poured it.

Q.   With treatment going to be able to continue through the Playoffs next week at Deutsche Bank; is it a treatment issue? 
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, well, I felt great until that tee shot at 12.   I was perfectly fine.   I was playing pretty good, and I was hanging right there and at the time Kev just made double at 11, and I was only one back. 
So I figured, you know, I was in the perfect spot, and unfortunately just couldn't finish off the rest of the day.

Q.   You going to play next week, at this point? 
TIGER WOODS:   That's all hypothetical right now.   I just got off and I'm not feeling my best right now.
