Q.   Birdied 2 of the first 3.  Talk about your day.  Obviously it went well.
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, it was a long day.  Thank God we get to go home and get some rest.
Q.   Talk about how long the golf course is playing.
TIGER WOODS:  The golf course is playing really long.  The fairways are soft and the greens are soft, but the good thing is, though, we do have ball in hand, so you get the ball in the fairway, you won't have any mud on your ball.  That's been a huge factor.
Q.   You got, what, four or five holes left?
TIGER WOODS:  I'm in the 13th fairway.
Q.   Your goal tomorrow would be to get a couple birdies coming in and give yourself a chance?
TIGER WOODS:  That would be nice.  We've got a long way to go.  This golf course is not going to get any easier.  We've got to stay patient.  The scores are not that low.  Guys are having a hard time making birdies out here, so we'll just try to stay patient.
