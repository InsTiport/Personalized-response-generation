  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 TIGER WOODS: I had two 3-putts in there and then I hit just a lot of beautiful putts that didn't go in. Could have easily been 3-, or 4-, or 5-under par.  
  
  Q. Just today you were talking about you have to have patience and this round must have really tested your patience.   
 TIGER WOODS: Right from the very get go. I piped a 3-wood and it ended up right in a divot. Not only in a divot, but it settled down in a divot. So I thought, I can't go at the flag, I just have to have enough contact to get on the green.   
 So it was a tough start and again just a lot of patience.  
  
  Q. What happened on the short putt on 11?  
 TIGER WOODS: I pulled it. Just absolutely pulled it. Yeah.  
  
  Q. It looked like you had your best rhythm and tempo that you've had in a long time today at least for about the first 14 holes.   
 TIGER WOODS: I swung the club well all day. That wasn't the problem. As I said, two 3-putts and a bunch of putts that looked like they were going to go in, so it was just, I just didn't make anything on the greens.  
  
  Q. Does the putting wear on the other shots, like were you thinking about it on the tee shots?  
 TIGER WOODS: Well I was hitting beautiful putts. It is what it is.  
  
  Q. 2 and 8 you hit 3-wood that both went near the flag and you end up walking away with pars. And 3-putting 15, those three holes were pretty important.   
 TIGER WOODS: As said, I missed a few putts out there. On top of that a couple little unforced errors out there.   
 And I should have capitalized on a couple more, like you said on 8 there and 15 and 2 as well.  
  
  Q. Can you still win this thing?  
 TIGER WOODS: Absolutely.   
  
  Q. There's a bunch of people that you got to pass.   
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, I got to go out there and put together a good round tomorrow and see what happens.
