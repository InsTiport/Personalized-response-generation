TIGER WOODS:  I didn't really play all that well today.  Didn't putt well, didn't play well, just had a tough day.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Kept pulling a lot of my shots and didn't leave myself very good birdie opportunities, and most of my putts were 20 feet and above.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  No, no, I was playing really well until then.  I hit good shots on 8, good shots on 9.  Just the back nine I kept pulling a lot of the shots.  I didn't take advantage of the par 5s, played them one over par, and you just can't do that out here because they're pretty easy.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  If I shoot 64 or 65 I'm right back in this thing where I could win.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Well, I was hitting good shots every hole until that one, and it just continued.  I finally judged the wind correctly.  For some reason I didn't get the wind quite right starting out, and I kind of put myself too far away from the hole and I finally judged it right and hit it nice and close where it was a nice, easy tap in.
Q.  When you're pulling shots    (inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I'm not going to hit balls today, I'm going to putt a little bit, try and get a little more solidified with what I'm working on in my putting and tomorrow just go out there and just swing the way I did starting out.  I hit the ball beautifully starting out.  I just didn't quite finish it off.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It was hard, but the greens were soft, and if you've got your irons going, you can put the ball in there nice and tight.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I didn't really get much going.  I didn't hit it close enough to get anything going.  You have to hit the ball close enough to make birdie, and I didn't do that today.  I hit the ball 20 feet and above, and you're not going to make 80 percent of your 20 footers, that's for sure.  You've got to get that ball inside ten feet, and I just didn't do that today.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  They're a little bit slower, but not bad.  It's an easy adjustment, but I just didn't hit the ball close enough.
