 Q.  Did you have a number in mind when you teed it up this morning? 
 TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, seven in a row would have been good.  I made too many mistakes.  I had four three-putts this week, two bad lies in bunkers, and a photographer on 9 yesterday.  All in all, to only finish two back, that's a good sign. 

 Q.  How important was this streak to you? 
 TIGER WOODS:  Well, you want to always win every one you play in, so you've just got to get ready for the next one. 

 Q.  People always say you get all the breaks, and then on 16 when you go for it with the driver on 16 and it hits that funky little lie in the bunker there, how bad a break was it? 
 TIGER WOODS:  If it was in the bunker it's a hard shot but not that bad.  From where I was you could leave it in the bunker or I decided to play conservative and put it 15, 20 feet past the hole.
