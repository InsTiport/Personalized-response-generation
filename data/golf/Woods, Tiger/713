 Q. Tiger, you saved the best for last. Your game was a little shaky heading up, but as soon as Jack got ahead of you, you said, unh-unh, no, Jack, not so fast. You got a nice little birdie and a great chip on the last hole. 
 TIGER WOODS: That was nice. It was a nice way to end it. Everyone sticking it out for the whole day. Hopefully, everyone will continue.

 Q. It was awesome. They were out ten deep. I guess it's typical for Ohio weather, right? 
 TIGER WOODS: Hopefully. When have we not played without the rain here?
