 Q. How did this feel today?
 TIGER WOODS: Oh, it felt good. It felt good to make some birdies and get to under par for the day. Got it going coming in.

 Q. Best round here since '05. What part of your game is really working for you?
 TIGER WOODS: I was just staying patient, that's all it was. I was trying to stay patient. I made a mistake at 7 by three-putting 7, and all I was trying to do was make sure I was at even par for the day and under par for the tournament at the turn, and as I said, just put -- 2-under par at the back nine and I would have been right there in the ballgame, and I got hot.

 Q. Do you feel like there are shots you can't recover from on this golf course?
 TIGER WOODS: You've just got to know where to place the golf ball. There's so many different ways you can play each and every hole. You know, for example, 2, Graeme today hit the ball straight right on the second shot so he could have an easy pitch. He was trying to hit the ball into 3 fairway. Most places you don't do that. But here you can. 

 Q. Did you sense this round was coming?
 TIGER WOODS: No, I was just being patient, just plodding myself along. That's all I was trying to do. Just stay in the present and stay in the moment and make a few birdies when I had the opportunities, and just if I made a mistake here and there, which I did early, just play the next shot. That's it. Thank you.
