 Q.   Did those last 13 holesdo anything for you productively as you move forward?   
TIGER WOODS:   It wasn't like it was that far off today.   So one bad hole.   
   
 Q.   I just mean in general, the round, besides 12?  
TIGER WOODS:   As I said, it wasn't that bad today.   It was just one hole that cost me obviously a few shots.   
   
 Q.   With Merion coming up, is it going to be a clean sheet?   Was this just a bad week, in other words?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, it happens.   It happens to us all.   And go home next week and practice.   
   
 Q.   You got 15 by today after a few problems this week?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, well, in a conventional way, I guess.   With a wedge in there to about three and a half feet behind it.   Other times I had a chance to go for it and knock it on there and didn't make very good shots.  
   
 Q.   What's the main thing you want to clean up next week before Merion?  
TIGER WOODS:   Everything.   You want everything clicking on all cylinders, especially at the U.S. Open, because everything is tested in the U.S. Open.  
   
 Q.   Was any one thing missing?  
TIGER WOODS:   I didn't putt very well.   I had bad speed all week.   I thought the greens didn't look that fast, but they were putting fast.   I could never get the speed of them.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, you want to come with me?   
   
 Q.   If it could help my putting, I would.  
The way that ball was plugged on 12?  
TIGER WOODS:   I was just trying to put the ball against the face on the upslope on the other side so I had a chance to spin the next one.   And it actually rolled back on the bottom where there's no sand.   I hit a decent shot and obviously skipped by.   And the first ball was awful.   Just bad speed.   The second putt I pulled, as well.   
   
 Q.   This is a weird week in that you probably hit the ball way worse and had much better finishes in your career.   Could you talk about that, you had the weird stance?  
TIGER WOODS:   It's just one of those weeks.   It happens.   This week I obviously didn't putt well.   I had some funky stances.   
At Honda I had two lost balls.   It just happens, happened to be one of those weeks.
