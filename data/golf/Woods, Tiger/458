 Q.   Tiger, alongside, we watch you at a distance, we know how hard you grind.   How did you manage your frustration today?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I just tried to give it everything I had on each and every shot, tried to stay focused and put the next shot where I wanted to put it.   That wasn't the case most of the time, but I was grinding hard.   
   
 Q.   What was the greatest challenge for you out there today?   
TIGER WOODS:   Well, not having much.   I didn't quite have it today with my swing, and unfortunately I just had to hang in there and be patient, and unfortunately I played the par‑3s in 3‑over and the par‑5s not so good, either.   
If I clean those up I'm under par, and I got off to‑‑ I was 2‑under through 3 and just blew that.  
   
 Q.   What was the turning point or change there after such a good start?   
TIGER WOODS:   Well, it was just‑‑ I can't say it was bad decisions or‑‑ I hit a bad putt there at 4, okay, no big deal.   I hit a bad shot there at 6, flipped it over the green, hit a hell of a pitch to get to where I got to.   Hit a good putt, just misread it, no big deal.   And then from there I missed a short one at 8, I missed a short one at 9, and I missed a couple on the back nine.  
   
 Q.   You made up seven shots last year in the final round to catch the leader.   How do you do that now?   
TIGER WOODS:   Well, that's one of the neat things about this tournament is the ten‑shot rule.   Anybody can still win the golf tournament if they make the cut.   Guys have won this tournament from five and six back going into the back nine.   I just need to cut that down a little bit tomorrow, play a good, solid round and cut that deficit down and get off to a quick start again on Sunday like I did last year.
