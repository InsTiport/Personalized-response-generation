Q.  Not your day today, and a bit of catching up to do tomorrow?
TIGER WOODS:  I struggled all day, didn't hit the ball well and didn't putt well. I was just trying to hang in there, trying not to be too far behind the leaders. The last two holes, I put myself on my back. I will have to shoot a great round tomorrow and hope that it's enough. Goose is a tough man to catch, he's playing solid but I've got to go out there and take care of my own business. We'll see what happens.
Q.  Obviously conditions a bit tougher?
TIGER WOODS:  As good as it was yesterday, it was as bad as it was today. That goes from the full swing to the shorter swing with the putter. I was just struggling all day.

Q.
Any number in mind for tomorrow?
TIGER WOODS:  It'll have to be a great one. Goose is up there and he's playing solidly. Hopefully I can get off to a positive start on the front nine and make a bunch of birdies and keep things going on the back.
