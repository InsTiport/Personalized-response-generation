 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I thought that the golf course played a little bit easier today, certainly. We were actually spinning the ball back today. It was a totally different golf course. And it played accordingly. 

 Q. How do you feel going into tomorrow?
 TIGER WOODS: I feel good. I'm right there. As we know, the U.S. Open is only going to get tougher as the weekend goes. The golf course will dry out. I know they put some water on it last night, and that's probably the last drink they will get. So it will firm up. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I'm going to have to make a few more birdies. I think I only made what? Three in the first two days. And I'm going to have to make a few more over the weekend in order to win. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Just amazing how much softer the golf course is. I played my practice rounds early and even then they weren't this soft. 
 Today it was amazing how much we were able to spin the ball back. A couple of us spun the ball back off the green. Westwood hit a shot on 18 that spun back about 50 feet. 
 So it's a different golf course, it is firming up a touch. Westwood and I hit shots that landed pin high on 9 and skipped to the back edge of the green with wedges in our hand. So it is starting to dry up now. 

 Q. You find yourself coming to a venue with obviously what happened 10 years ago, that's been talked about a great deal. But how difficult is it for you to just try to keep all that aside because of what you did 10 years ago and just stay on track with the progress that you're making?
 TIGER WOODS: It's easy. Very easy. 

 Q. How so?
 TIGER WOODS: Well I'm right there. I'm right there in the championship. I just need to make a few more birdies, a few more putts on the weekend and I'll be right there.

 Q. Are there any shots that you feel like you want to make and haven't been able to do?
 TIGER WOODS: I put the ball right where I need to be, I missed the ball on the correct sides, all the shots I've hit this week I think I've only short sided myself two times this week. So that's not bad. 

 Q. Do you like your position?
 TIGER WOODS: Absolutely. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: 3-wood. I just hooked it. I was trying to hit a hook down there and roll it down there and just way overdid it. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah. But nowhere near as yesterday though because obviously I think the sun's not out, so I don't think the poa is going to quite spring up as much as it did yesterday. 

 Q. Chip in for birdie on 11 like that, are you starting to think maybe things are turning, this is going to be my day, maybe there's a good round to be had out there?
 TIGER WOODS: We knew there was a good round to be had because there was no wind early. We listened to what Mike said about the golf course, they put some water on it, so we knew we could be a little bit more aggressive this morning. 
 So, yeah, I mean you can see some of the guys are shooting some good round out there in the 60s and you certainly can do that. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I just need to keep progressing and keep moving my way up the board. It's a long haul. The U.S. Open is not going to get easier as the week goes on. Especially on the weekend. And from what I hear it's supposed to be overcast, so I'm sure there will be a few more birdies than we normally would see. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Well I just need to keep progressing. It's a long process. This is a tournament where you don't win it with one round, but you can lose it with one round. And you just got to keep making progress and as I said, it's a long process winning a U.S. Open. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: No, if we were all -- we were all talking about that this morning on the range. You just got to ask the guys. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Well, yeah, because what happens when you roll them in the morning, you smash down the poa, and then in the afternoon the poa comes back up and then you get some sun and then it starts popping. You can see it germinating, it starts turning white, the white heads start coming up. So it gets a little bit more bumpy in the afternoon. 

 Q. Do you see somebody going out in the afternoon and doing what Graeme or Ernie did?
 TIGER WOODS: No, because they put some water on the greens last night. And as I said, we were spinning the ball back, 20, 30, 40 feet. Which is way different than what was going on yesterday. 
 Ernie hit a good shot there at 8 and his ball didn't get up on the green. Yesterday we were landing the ball 20 yards short of the green and it jumped up. 
 Westwood and I hit 7-irons in there and I spun mine back. Whereas yesterday we landed the ball 20 yards short of the green and it bounced up. So it's very different than it was yesterday. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Not that much because when we play here it's usually soft. It's not the same breaks. It's two totally different types of situations putting during the AT&T versus how you do it at a U.S. Open. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: We never came down here. No, we went up to Olympic and played up there. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I feel very good. I'm right there and I'm only, what, seven back. And this is a long haul at a U.S. Open. This is a long haul.
