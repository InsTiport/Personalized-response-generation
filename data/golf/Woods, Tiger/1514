Q.  Tiger, obviously a very difficult day for you.  Were you up late last night?

TIGER WOODS:  I was up at the hospital with my dad.  And, hopefully, he's okay.


Q.  How difficult was it for you to play golf on a day like today after what happened last night?

TIGER WOODS:  I didn't want to be here today, because there are more important things in life than golf, and I love my dad to death and I wouldn't want to see anything happen to him.
