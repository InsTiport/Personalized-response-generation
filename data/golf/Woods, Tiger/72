 Q.  I know you're awfully disappointed of the outcome of the match on the last hole.  Did he surprise you at all?  
TIGER WOODS: He hit it well.  He hit a lot of good shots today.  These are not easy conditions out here.  The wind is all over the place.  He was flighting it well.  His natural ball flight is pretty flat.  It's advantageous in these conditions.   
 Q.  Prior to you hitting that last putt, we talked about (inaudible) did you see it that way?  Did it look odd to you?  
TIGER WOODS: Well, we read it inside left, left center, and the putt went left.  I went back and hit it again and it did the same thing.  Just one of those weird spots.  Had a lot of difficult pins out there.  It is match play and they're going to put the pins on the difficult side, and they did.  And we just have to hit good shots.
