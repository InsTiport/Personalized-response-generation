  Q. How much did the bomb at 14 do for you?  
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, 14 was nice. 12 was even better because I had just bogeyed 10, 11, and it was nice to make that putt at 12 and get something going. I still don't know how my ball stopped there at 14. I hit a terrible tee shot and hit a 5-iron in there and it landed right there and stopped, and I made a bomb.  
  
  Q. Given these scoring conditions and how pristine it is, how do you assess your scoring on a day like this?  
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I hit beautiful putts all day. I hit a couple bad ones, but overall felt really good over the putts. Realistically the round probably should have been 68, 69.  
  
  Q. You try to avoid the repetitive pattern of old swings and trusting it as you work on it with Sean. How much did you trust it today and how did it manifest?  
 TIGER WOODS: You have to trust. We're in a major championship and it's time to go. Full systems go.  
  
  Q. Do you feel good about where you are?  
 TIGER WOODS: Absolutely. I'm only six back.
