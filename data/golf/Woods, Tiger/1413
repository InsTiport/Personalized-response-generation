Q. A good comeback on the 18th.

TIGER WOODS: Yeah, I played pretty well off the tee and hit a good iron shot in there.
With the putt, I was just -- I hate to think negative, but as I hit the putt, I felt I
rolled it beautifully, just like I had been all day. I said, "Well, I'm just waiting
for this one to lip out." (Inaudible.) The guys are playing well. This golf course
can be had if you're driving the ball well. The greens are soft; they're very receptive.
And if you're aggressive off the tee down the right side or correct side of the fairway,
you can shoot a lot under. You can still win if you're over par. In this golf course, if
you get the right wind coming out here, if you can shoot 4-, 5-under par, you'll make up a
lot of ground. Because this golf course is playing extremely fast right now, and they can
hide these pins around some of these cork trees, and they're tough to get to.

Q. Are you still fluffing a bit from coming over from America?

TIGER WOODS: No, I feel great. I feel great. (Inaudible.)
