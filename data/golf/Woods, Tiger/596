 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I'm playing China and Australia and then obviously Chevron.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Man, yeah, I striped it early. I didn't miss a shot for the first four holes. And then after that I hit it awful.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: We got a long way to go before that ever happens. Augusta is a long way off. Between now and then I got a lot of tournaments to play in.
 So obviously next year's a different set of major championship sites, except for Augusta, but still we have plenty of time.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I thought I could. I thought I could. Certainly. Just got to play well at the right time. Just four days. I just got to put it together for four days and I never did that.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Well the thing that I was shocked about this golf course is how do we get 70 plus guys at 1-over par or better. That's pretty impressive.
 No one would have expected the cut to be at 1-over, ever. Not here. But it goes to show you if you get soft greens, no matter how hard the golf course may be, guys are going to tear it apart. And that's what they did this week.
 Today it was different though. The greens were faster, almost a foot faster than they were the last couple days, so it was playing a lot more difficult out there now, greens are running a little bit, still holding, but they're giving it up a little bit as you're putting.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: It is. It is visually. I guess there's a lot going on. But there's a lot of room out there. There's a lot of room on the greens too.
 But that's what Pete Dye usually does anyway. He takes away a lot of things or draws your eye to different places, but there's actually a lot of room around the greens, a lot of room in the fairways, and the greens aren't as severe as they may look like. But the green speeds again were as down as they have been, so.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I hit my irons really good today. I drove it terrible. Couldn't quite get it. I was able to hit my 3-wood well. But I just couldn't get a feel with the driver on how to do that. I was doing it on the range pretty good, but just couldn't carry it through.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I think I got a chance of maybe helping out in singles.
 (Laughter.). save me to singles. No, I mean, no, I feel like my game is a lot better than it was obviously last week, and given a little bit more time it's starting to head in the right direction now, which is good. And I'm looking forward to it, hopefully Corey will pick me on the team.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Disappointed, certainly. In order for it to be a great year you have to win a major championship. I won six times last year and it was a good year, yeah, but it wasn't a great year. There are times when I had won major championships in a year and I consider that being a great year.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I asked him to take a look at my swing this week and give me some ideas of what he sees. I like some of his, some of the things he had to say about my golf swing and where I needed to go. I like the direction because I was able to hit the shots that I used to be able to hit feel wise. And I used to be -- and the shape of shots too which was great. So when you get that kind of contact again it's good.
 As far as working down the road, I'm sure I'm going to see him a little bit more. I still want to pick his brain a little bit more. I don't really have all of his whole concept yet. But I would like to get to know him a little bit more before I fully get into it.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: It's called golf.

 Q. Why does it affect you every now and then?
 TIGER WOODS: I haven't won every tournament I've ever played in. There are tournaments that I have lost in the past.
 (Laughter.)

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: Well Corey texts me a lot so, I'm sure he'll be texting me or calling me and I'm sure we'll be talking. We still have what, two more weeks, right? Two more weeks before the picks? Three more weeks?

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 TIGER WOODS: I feel good about the way I was hitting my irons this week and then especially today. The way I was able to drive my irons through the wind today. It felt good again to do that. To shape it both ways. I didn't drive it very good, so I was pleased with that.

 Q. How do you feel about the reception you get out here with the fans and the crowd support?
 TIGER WOODS: They have been great all week, from the practice rounds to the tournament rounds. But they have been loud all week, they're into it. And I'm surprised that more people came out yesterday, especially with the Packers playing, so it was good to have them out here.
