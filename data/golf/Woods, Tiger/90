 Q.  You ran into what has been a buzzsaw team in Frank could he and Tommy, what was the difference in that match up?  
TIGER WOODS: The three matches we played, they never missed a putt inside ten, 12 feet.  That's hard to do.  Playing against a team like that, that's putting that well, you're going to have to make a lot of birdies, and we didn't.   
 Q.  What do you and the rest of your teammates do tonight to prepare for what's going to be an opportunity tomorrow?  
TIGER WOODS: It looks like we're going to probably be about four back, and we've got some work to do tomorrow.  Hopefully we can get off to a quick start and get up in some of these matches, and turn the tide a little bit.   
 Q.  In regards to your game and your body, how are you feeling?  
TIGER WOODS: Everything feels pretty good.  Just pretty pissed off, the fact that I lost three matches, and didn't feel like I played poorly.  That's the frustrating thing about match play.  We can play well and nothing can happen.  We ran against two guys that were both playing well and when one was out of the hole, especially in best-ball, the other one made birdie and vice versa.  They did that a lot to us.  At one point, they made, what, six out of eight birdies on the back nine, and only one person was in the hole at a time.  That's the nature of match play.
