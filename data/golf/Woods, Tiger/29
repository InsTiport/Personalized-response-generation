Q. You're so emotional with all these other guys, what's going on inside?
TIGER WOODS: We did it together. We came here as a team. My teammates and my boys all played well. The captains did an amazing job of just being there for every little detail. I couldn't have done it without all their help and all my boys. They did it.
Q. Of all the things you've done in your career, new is not something that happens very often. You won 82 in Tokyo a couple of months ago, and here you are as a captain for the very first time. How were you able to get outside yourself?
TIGER WOODS: It's been one of the more amazing challenges, but you know, Stricks and Coups and Zach, they were amazing. All the guys, they believed in one another. We relied on one another as a team and we did it together.
Q. You talk about doing it together. You said yesterday about five times when we were interviewing you on the 16th green, you trusted your guys. How important is it for you, even after you're behind for a couple of days, to trust the system, the players and to keep pushing forward, knowing that the plan you have is what's going to be successful in your own mind?
TIGER WOODS: Well, I trust all my 11 guys. I trust them implicitly; I told them from the very get go. They went out there and got the points we needed. We fought. Even the points we lost, we were making them earn every one of them, and this Cup wasn't going to be given to us. We had to go earn it, and we did.
