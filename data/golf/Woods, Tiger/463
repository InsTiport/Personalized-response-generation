Q.   There's got to be a lot of emotions right now, tell me what you're thinking as you complete the job?
TIGER WOODS:   Pure joy.   Today was, it was a rough day.   The conditions, the greens were feisty.   Pins were unbelievable.   I've never seen pins this difficult and greens this fast and firm.   The wind was blustery, changed directions enough and the intensity was tough out there.   It was a day of survival.

Q.   That walk across the street was full of emotion, as well.   How hard was it to contain that within yourself, which I know you always try to do. 
TIGER WOODS:   It was fun until my ball reached the green.   Granted I had a five‑shot lead, but I've souped it there a couple of times, and we've had some interesting finishes this year on TOUR.   So just keeping it over to the left somewhere on dry land, somewhere around pin‑high and I'll be good.   As soon as I did that, then trouble is over.
