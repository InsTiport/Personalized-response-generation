 Q.  In your first seven holes, how do you think you were playing out there?  
TIGER WOODS: Well, it was fine.  I'm 3-under par, so I felt I was headed in the right direction.  Tomorrow is going to be a long day for a lot of us and try and get back at it early tomorrow morning.   
 Q.  Do you think -- the course was a little soft to begin with, do you think the rain will affect it much or not really?  
TIGER WOODS: The good thing is we're going to have the greens prepared before we go back out there and to finish up our second round.  It would have been quite a bit different if we had to go back out this afternoon and finish it up.  But the greens will be freshly cut, so it will be just like it was when we played on Thursday.
