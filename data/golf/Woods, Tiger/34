Q. How would you describe a moment like that?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I don't know. I'm speechless. I've made a lot of for big putts and hit a lot of big shots but to do it with my captain and an unbelievable teammate to win the match and hopefully turn the tide in The Presidents Cup, that was awesome.
Q. One of the things you told us last week was you couldn't wait to compete in something like this. What was going on inside?
TIGER WOODS: We were just fighting. We were just fighting. It's J.T. and I and we got in our own little bubble and doing our thing. We were up early, they flipped it on us and then we were kind of fighting, clawing our way back. Last hole, gives me absolute chills, man.
Q. When you see a point like that go up on the board, what does that mean for the other 11 guys?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's huge. I mean, stuff can change so quickly in this format, but I heard PC made a great putt to win the hole to flip their match, as well. These guys are clawing back.
I know one thing, I like our chances a lot more getting those two points.
Q. How important was that putt and this match?
TIGER WOODS: Well, we did it together. J.T. and I were up early and they flipped it on us and we clawed our way back, and we're fortunate to get a win here and hopefully we can turn this momentum around. We've got a long way to go.
Q. Could this moment be a pivot-changer for you guys?
TIGER WOODS: That was the plan, and J.T. and I just got locked in, doing what we could do. We could only control our point and we did it.
