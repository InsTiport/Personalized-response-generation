  Q. Your reaction to golf getting the nod for 2016?   
 TIGER WOODS: I think it's great for golf. It's a perfect fit for the Olympics, and I think we are all looking forward to golf getting into the Olympics.  
  
  Q. What would it mean for someone to be a part of the Olympics?  
 TIGER WOODS: Well, you'd have to ask Olympic athletes. We as golfers have never had it, so this will be a new experience for golfers who get to participate in the Olympics.   
 Having talked to other athletes who have gotten a chance to experience the Olympics, they have absolutely loved it and had the greatest time.
