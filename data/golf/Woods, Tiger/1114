Q.  Golf giveth and taketh away.
TIGER WOODS:  I started off hitting it really good.  I just putted terrible.  I had no speed on the greens.  I either ran it by ten feet or I left it six or seven feet short.  I just never had the speed.

Then all of a sudden I started putting good and my game went bad.  I could never put both of them together.  It was one or the other on each hole, so I just had to pick my poison.
Q.  Did you think the winner would come out of your group?
TIGER WOODS:  Yes, definitely, but we gave all the guys at 5-under hope because we got off to such a bad start that they knew we were struggling back there, so if they posted a good number they could win the tournament.

I figured if Jay and I both shot under par on the front nine, we could put it out of reach, but because we struggled early, we gave the guys behind us so much momentum and hope that they could pass us.  Goose did a great job.  He made birdie after birdie after birdie, and then birdieing 16 basically sealed the deal.
Q.  He did what he had to do.
TIGER WOODS:  He did what he had to do, go out there and post a number, and hopefully it would be good enough, and it was.
Q.  As you look back on the season, you just walked off the last TOUR event of the year.  How do you feel about the season overall?
TIGER WOODS:  The season has been disappointing that I didn't win a major championship this year, but I've made some great strides in my game, which I'm really excited about, even though it didn't show much today, over the last two days it did.

My finishes over the past three, four months have been pretty good, so I'm moving in the right direction.  I have to keep building on this as I go overseas and then finish it here in the States and keep building on this for next year.
