Q.  Can you talk about how wet it was out there?
TIGER WOODS:   It was pretty wet.  It was just really wet, and, you know, they did the right thing in calling it.  Wish they would have called it a little earlier but as long as we're in.

Q.  You've had some good shots, especially on the par  3s, is it just a matter of getting some putts to fall in?
TIGER WOODS:   The greens, they are soft, and it's tough to make putts.  It's tough to hit it close more than anything, and I didn't hit it that close today.  Hopefully I can do a little better job tomorrow.

Q.  After you had a drop on 7, how good of a shot was that, your second shot?
TIGER WOODS:   It wasn't that hard of a shot, actually that's why I hit driver there.  Put it in the rough on the fairway and pitched it up on the green in the back.  When I got to the green  I expected it to roll back a little further, but with as wet as the greens were, it was crazy to figure out. 

Q.  And how about as far as your playing tomorrow, long day? 
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, a long day it's going to be tomorrow, and hopefully I can play a little better and improve my chances.
