 Q.   Just some comments on a tough day today.  
    TIGER WOODS:   It was a rough day.   It was tough out there from beginning to end.  
   
 Q.   On holes like the 18th or throughout the day, is there a fine line when you barely miss a few shots here and things snowball?  
    TIGER WOODS:   We didn't hit that many bad shots starting out the day and the next thing you know we are quite a few over par.   It was a tough day.   I tried to fight back on the back nine, just didn't quite materialize.  
   
 Q.   How hard is it to shrug a round like this off and just chalk it up as one of those days and come back?  
    TIGER WOODS:   It's just one of those things where I'm sure I'm not the only one who struggled out there.   The conditions were tough, when I missed it cost me.   I caught the wrong gusts at the wrong time, made a couple bag swings and all in all it just went the wrong way.
