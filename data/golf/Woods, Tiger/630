 Q. What happened?
 TIGER WOODS: I withdrew.

 Q. I know, but we just heard that you hurt yourself. 
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I've been playing with a bad neck for quite a while.

 Q. Was there one particular swing that exacerbated it?
 TIGER WOODS: They want me to go get a picture on it next week. I might have a bulging disk.

 Q. You've been doing this quite a bit. 
 TIGER WOODS: I've been playing through it. I can't play through it anymore.

 Q. Any idea what caused it? 
 TIGER WOODS: I don't know. I don't know. I know playing doesn't help it. 

 Q. Did playing this week make it a lot worse?
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I'm having a hard time with the pain. There's tingling down my fingers.

 Q. Both sides?
 TIGER WOODS: Just the right side. 

 Q. When did you first feel it? Was it pre-Masters?
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, pre-Masters.

 Q. Where does it hit you as you're playing?
 TIGER WOODS: Backswing, downswing, follow-through.

 Q. So pre-shot is okay?
 TIGER WOODS: Setting up over the ball is fine, but once I start making the motion, it's downhill from there.
