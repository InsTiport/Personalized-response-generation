TIGER WOODS:  Starting out didn't do much in the middle of the round and Jim held us in there and all of a sudden I made a nice little bomb there on 16 which is nice.
Q.  Captain Jack Nicklaus made a point to come up to you after you finished 18; what did he say?
TIGER WOODS:  Good match.  He blamed it on Sluy for the for the horn.
Q.  How tired are you?
TIGER WOODS:  I'm a little tired, 36 today.  Can't wait to get something to eat.  I'm starting right now.
Q.  Do you have a choice going out tomorrow, middle, last, or it doesn't matter?
TIGER WOODS:  It doesn't matter right now because of the fact it's so close, I think we're tied.  Anything could happen.

Looks like it could probably go down to the very last few matches.  We'll see what happens and what Jack wants to do.
