 Q. How much tougher was it out there today for you compared to yesterday?
 TIGER WOODS: Come on, it was a lot tougher today. The wind was not only blowing; it was blowing; it was changing directions; it was gusty. It was just hard to decide what it was doing, and then once you hit the shot, it could change. It was affecting putts a lot. The greens were bumpy. It was just a tough day all around.

 Q. How difficult to calculate the pace of the greens? It seemed like that was really tough for you today? 
 TIGER WOODS: You know, you just don't want to run it by the hole. You run those 3-, 4-footers, and because they are so hard to make coming back, and you know, consequently, starting out, I didn't get a putt to the hole. I just didn't want to leave those 3-, 4-footers coming back. But you have to be committed enough to get the ball aggressively to the hole, or it just going to basically bounce off line. 

 Q. Looking forward, how much pressure does it place on the field to have you in this position? 
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I think we're all feeling the pressure. It's a major championship. If you're not feeling the pressure in a major, then probably you shouldn't be playing. 

 Q. But when I throw out to you, last 12 times you've been in this position, you've closed it, perfect record in the majors closing it out; how does that adjust your mind-set, or do you care at all? 
 TIGER WOODS: Just because I'm 12-for-12 doesn't mean anything tomorrow. You've got to go out there and play and those shots, those things I did 12 times doesn't do a damn bit of good tomorrow. 
 You have to place your golf ball around the golf course, you've got to play and execute and tomorrow is supposed to be just as windy, so again, another day of executing and being very patient.
