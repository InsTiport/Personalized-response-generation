 Q.  Tiger, congratulations.  What did you prove to yourself today?  
TIGER WOODS: I don't know, but it was just a grind out there.  I loved every bit of it.  The fight and the grind and the tough conditions and just have to suck it up and hit shots, and I loved every bit of it.   
 Q.  You've been through an awful lot since your last victory on the PGA TOUR in 2013.  What gave you the belief that you would be here today with win No. 80?  
TIGER WOODS: Depends when you ask me.  At the beginning of the year, certainly that was a tall order.  But as the year progressed, I proved that I could play, and I found a swing and put pieces together, and I knew I could do it again.   
 Q.  You have made some incredible walks in this sport.  Never seen anything like this in all the years we've been together, here at East Lake especially.  What is it like now hearing all these people chant your name?  
TIGER WOODS: I mean, I'm having a hard time not crying the last hole.  I said, hey, you know what, I can still blade this thing out of bounds.  Just suck it up and let's hit some shots.  Here, and once I got the ball on the green, I gave Joey a high five because it was done.  I could handle that from there.   
 Q.  It's been a long time since we've said this:  Congratulations, Tiger.  
TIGER WOODS: Thanks, Sandsy.
