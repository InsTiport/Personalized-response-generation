 Q. Talk about being behind on a difficult golf course. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, started right away from the get-go really. We just never got into really any flow, any momentum, anything. We never put any pressure on them. And they played great. You know, 4-under through, what did we play, 12 holes, that's pretty good playing. 
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, just like Steve was staying, we were just obviously slightly off. We hit some good shots down there and he would be a foot in the rough or I hit a sweet drive back there on 11 that's over the green and he has no shot. You know, then you have to go after some of these flags which you don't want to go after, but we are so far behind, we have to.
 It's one of those things where we got down a little bit early, tried to make up some shots and these guys were playing well.

 Q. You've been so successful in team competition; will this make you sharpen up your focus for tomorrow? 
 TIGER WOODS: We don't have to worry about our focus. 
 STEVE STRICKER: We were just talking, the last couple of times we went out, we have not been good. Just one of those things, we were a little off and they played great and that combination led to a lob sided defeat.
