Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I put four good rounds last week, unfortunately it wasn't this week.   Didn't seem to hit it as good and didn't make many putts until the last few holes today.   But I didn't give myself many looks and certainly didn't hit the ball good enough to be in it. 
Jim is 9‑under par right now.   I've had nine birdies through 72 holes, so not enough birdies.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Okay then.   Glad we talked about it.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   It was tight all day.   It's been tight all day.   Just one of those things.

Q.   First time you've played with Brooks?
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, really talented.   Good kid.   I mean, we were talking about he lives right down the road from where I live and he's thinking about becoming a member at Medalist.   Come out there and played a few more rounds. 
It's good to see.   I mean, he earned his way.   He won three times and now he's on the European Tour.   It's good to see.   Good, old‑fashioned work pays off and he should be proud of it.

Q.   Phil said he's not going to touch a club for fivedays and just relax.   What are your plans?
TIGER WOODS:   Try and keep up with a four and six‑year‑old.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I was close in two of them.   I was right there and certainly had a chance to win the Masters and the British this year.   The other two, I just didn't hit it good enough.   Just the way it goes.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   The golf course is set up to be had.   There are a few really hard pins out there, really, really hard pins.   If you can navigate through those holes, make your pars, there's certainly some gettable pins, as well. 
With it being soft, they give us some pretty easy pins from 12 on in.   It'll be interesting to see how some of these guys play, especially some of the shorter hitters.   You still got the huge backstop behind it and you can almost hole it.   It'll be interesting to see what happens.

Q.   Talk about Adam Scott. 
TIGER WOODS:   Well, he's played well over the last few years.   He's really turned his game around, and I think he's a little bit more focused on playing the right schedule, not playing as much.   I've always thought that was the key, don't over do it, don't play too much.   He's backed off his schedule and I think he's prepped really well for major championships.   He's been in probably, what, three‑quarters of them or half of them with a chance to win them.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   The only time it was really hard was going into '01, you know.   That was really tough because I was asked basically every day and every round for eightmonths.   Is it a grand slam, not a grand slam?   Are you going to try to win all four?   To hear it for ‑‑ then I was a slump through that period, too.   I didn't win for three tournaments or something like that.   I heard it for a very long time.   So that was a long wait. 
But most years it's not so bad.   You have got the playoffs here and most of us play overseas towards the end of the year, and then get ready for next year.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   I was pretty close to where we thought it would be.   We thought it might be maybe another step or two deeper in the green.   But it's a really tough pin because if you hit it flag high left, it's going to roll off and be into the greens, right where we all walk off.   It's a nasty little chip, because you've got to get it up over that hill and then it runs away from you.   You can easily chip in the water or flub it. 
If you play short, you know, short of the flag and 20feet, it's not so bad.   But if you try and get it back there, it's a really tough pin.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Absolutely.   They've had other major here, Ryder Cups.   It's a fantastic golf course.   It's really tough. 
This week ‑‑ when I came here and prepped last week for it, the rough was about what it is now.   They cut it back for the tournament and then obviously let it go as the week went on.   And with the rain, they just let it go.   It's back to where it was last week right now.   But it's really tough and the greens are starting to pick up a little bit of speed. 
You saw them yesterday afternoon with those guys running putts by.   It's getting there now, too.   They are soft, but they are quick.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Is it concerning?   No.   As I've said, I've been there in half of them.   So that's about right.   If you are going to be in there three‑quarters or half of them with a chance to win on the back nine, you have just got to get it done.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   We have a long way to go to that and I have a lot of golf to play between now and then, not just the rest of our season but overseas as well and beginning of next year.   We have got a long way to go for that.   Now is just like what Phil said, he is going to take fivedays off.   I will do something similar and get ready for the playoffs and the Presidents Cup. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Well, it's more frustrating not being in it.   Having a chance on the back nine on Sunday, I can live with that.   It's always frustrating going out there, and I'm 3‑over today, got to 7, and I'm grinding my tail off coming in just to shoot even par for the day.   And I'm nowhere in it.   That's tough. 
I'd much rather have it like at Augusta or at the British when I have a chance.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Say again.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   I would like to, yes, absolutely.
