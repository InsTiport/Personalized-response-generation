TIGER WOODS:  It was right at it.  That's what happens when it hits the wrong wind.  I caught the wrong wind over on 13 today, same thing.  It just swirls, and I hit two good shots and both of them missed the green.  That's kind of the way it goes.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I didn't think I played that poorly.  I made nothing starting out.  I put myself in position to make putts and I made nothing, and then towards the end I made a few putts to keep me where I'm at right now.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  16, 17, 18.  I mean, I didn't make any putts, as I said.  I hit a few shots in there close and didn't make them, and when I needed to make a par, a par putt early in the round, I didn't make those.  It was important to at least get something salvaged in this round of golf, and I was able to do it in the last three holes with three good putts.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, it's kind of seems to be that way, you know.  We've all been through it, and it's just something you have to keep fighting through, and when it turns, that's great, but you've got to just keep plugging along, keep fighting, keep grinding it out and put the ball in the right position to make birdies.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  16, it was probably about 15 feet behind the hole.

17 was a little bit closer, about 12 feet.

18 was about what I made on 16, about 15 feet.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It is but it isn't.  What I mean by that is that I'm hitting quality golf shots and then I'm either not converting the putts when I'm hitting them close to get some kind of possible momentum, or when I hit a poor shot, it just seems to be in a position where it's very difficult to make par.
Q.  How important is the cut streak to you and how much will you think about that tomorrow?
TIGER WOODS:  I'd just like to go out there and not make as many bogeys.  I think that's the number one 1 key, and also make some more birdies.  If I make my normal amount of birdies, I shoot even par.  But I just haven't made any birdies.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  You know, I was trying to hit the ball -- if you can believe it, trying to hit it down a little bit because obviously the wind is blowing so hard left to right, and I caught the grass coming out.  I drove it into the hill.  If I would have gone ahead and hit it straight up in the air, I could have gotten it to the green, but I probably over did it.  I tried to hit it a little flatter, a little 5-iron.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I just needed to get myself going a little bit, shoot something -- if I get into the red figures, I'll be all right.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  A 9-iron.  Wasn't a big one, either.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  43 on top, 49 hole.
Q.
Talk about that second shot on 18.
TIGER WOODS:  I was trying to feed off the slope, or if not, put it in that right bunker.  I had a shot, but the problem is I went ahead and tried to really turn it.  I could easily run it in the water, so I kind of protected it a little bit, and then I just got it -- just a very interesting lie there on the third shot, being on the downslope.  I really had no shot.  I thought I did pretty good just to keep it on the green.  Then I made a good putt.
Q.  Did you say what you hit on 17?
TIGER WOODS:  9-iron.

I mean, this golf course is going to firm up a little bit.  Greens are really receptive today.  I think that's why you're seeing so many low scores today is that the balls are backing up.  They weren't like that on Monday, but they really saturated the greens, trying to protect them with the cool front that came through here.  I think as the week goes on, they're only going to firm out.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I think that will put me right where I want to be on the weekend to try and have a chance to win this tournament.
