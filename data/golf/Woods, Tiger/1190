Q. (Inaudible)
TIGER WOODS: I played alright -- I didn't hit the ball all that close to the holes, basically the only putt I missed all day, the only one I had a chance to make, was on 18. Overall it was a pretty good day.
Q. (Inaudible)
TIGER WOODS:  I hit a couple of loose shots at the start of the day, but kept it going and from there I started to hit it a lot better, I just didn't get the ball as close as I needed to get it.
Q. The leaders have a nice lead but it's not beyond the bounds of possibility -- you could catch them yet?
TIGER WOODS:   Oh, yes, I mean anyone on that board over there can definitely do it. The golf course is definitely firming up, the greens are firming up, the only thing is the pins are not going to be that difficult tomorrow because I saw the marks out there on the greens, so if the guys can get it going coming from behind then they can put a little heat on the guys up ahead.
Q. (Inaudible)
TIGER WOODS:  I don't know if the wind is going to blow tomorrow or not. The way the golf course is firming up, it's hard to get the ball close. The shots that were backing up on the first couple of days weren't doing that today so we'll see how it is tomorrow with the weather.
Q. (Inaudible)
TIGER WOODS:  Yes - you realise that you don't have to worry about your playing partner, you just go ahead and play your own game and you couldn't care less what anyone else is doing, that's how strokeplay is played and matchplay is totally different, each shot is dictated by what your opponent does and you dictate what he does so it's two totally different atmospheres.
Q. (Inaudible)
TIGER WOODS:  I hit so many good putts today. Basically you've got to hit it a little firmer because they're not putting it that fast -- especially when you get puts going against the grain here. Putts against the grain are pretty slow and you have got to know how the grain is on each hole.
Q. (Inaudible)
TIGER WOODS: Couple of bad tee shots on one and then I pulled it on 16 but other than that I struck it pretty good today.
Q. (Inaudible)
TIGER WOODS: Eight was a hard tee shot with the wind today -- I think I was trying to take something off of it with the driver. I should have probably hit three wood in hindsight because the wind wasn't in our face as it was the first two days -- it was coming across a bit more. I just pulled the drive, but the second shot was a good one and the third was just pure luck to hole the third from that distance.
Q. (Inaudible)
TIGER WOODS: Some of the pins were a little dicey to get at and you had to get at and you had to be very careful because you could miss these greens on the short side. I kind of fat sided some of shots into the greens and consequently I had some longer putts.
Q. Having said that did you just about get where you wanted to be?
TIGER WOODS: No, I felt today that if I had played well I could probably get to double figures and then give myself a really good chance and I figured the leaders wouldn't run away with it because the greens were firming up the way they were -- I just didn't take care of the par fives the way I should have, I parred two of them and if I had made birdies I would have be up there on ten under.
Q. Looking at final round, can you rely on getting a break from the golf course?
TIGER WOODS:  You just go out there and play your game, and I'm putting really well just now so if I go out there and get enough looks at it then I'm going to get my share. But that's the hard part -- getting in there close enough with the greens being as they are.
Q. Do you have a figure in your head for the final round?
TIGER WOODS:  I don't know -- if the wind gets up then you won't have to go as low but I just have to go out there and put some heat on those guys that are behind me on the course.
