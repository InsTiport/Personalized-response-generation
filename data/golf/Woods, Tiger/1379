Q.  Tiger, it's been a very unTiger-like 36 holes, do you have an explanation for what's gone wrong?
 
TIGER WOODS:  No, I'm trying as hard as I can, and sometimes things don't go your way, and that's the way things go. 
 
Q.  Is it a swing flaw or your timing is off a little bit, maybe?
 
TIGER WOODS:  I'm going out there and I'm trying, and, unfortunately, I'm not hitting the ball as crisp as I wanted to. But that's just the way it is. 
 
Q.  I was intrigued with some of your reactions, almost every once in a while there was a rye smile, like you were chuckling at yourself, like that lie in the bunker on the 4th?
 
TIGER WOODS:  If you can't laugh at yourself, then who can you laugh at?  I grinded my way around the golf course for two days.  I'm proud of the way I hung in there.  I've got myself out of trouble and made some big pars. 
 
Q.  Can you get it turned around and win this championship?
 
TIGER WOODS:  I hope so.  Hopefully I can post a good number, pretty much like Brooksie is doing right now.  If I can shoot a good number, I can move up the board. 
 
Q.  Good luck the rest of the way.
