Q.  Tiger, well done.  You've done your bit.  Does it feel like it might be too little, too late?
TIGER WOODS:  Well, we'll see.  A lot depends on whether or not Jim can halve his match somehow.  You can't let the Europeans get full points.  We've still got to win matches.  The guys behind us are going to have to turn it around and get up.  They're down in a lot of matches back there.
Q.  Was it a difficult thing going that far behind an Irish crowd in these conditions?
TIGER WOODS:  Well, you had to make birdies early and you had to get ahead in your match.  Robert and I, I think the first three or four holes, you won with birdies.  That's what you had to do.

By the looks of it, it looks like the Europeans are making all the birdies back there.
