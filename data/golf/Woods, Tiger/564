 Q. Talk about today.
 TIGER WOODS: Well, today struggled a little bit. Didn't hit it very good and had a couple three putts there, and had five lip-outs. So score could have been worse, but also it could have been a lot better.

 Q. What are the demanding aspects of this course? 
 TIGER WOODS: Well, the pins were tough today. They had some really good pins. 
 But if you were aggressive enough and got it down there, you could take care of some of these holes. Some of the guys were able to do; Ernie did today, very aggressive all day, and drove the ball in play and was able to take care of it.
