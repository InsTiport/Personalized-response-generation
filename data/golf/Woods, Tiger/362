 Q.Do you think the momentum played a factor?  
TIGER WOODS:   No, because we were all square a bunch of times out there, and he never got more than 1‑up most of the day until he made that putt there at 16.   But it was a tight match.   I had some putts to‑‑ at 10, 11, 12 there, he had a putt there at 14.   We missed our share of putts out there, which‑‑ it was a good, solid match for both of us, but he made a couple birdies there at 16‑‑ sorry, 15 and 16.  
   
 Q.   First competitive round since Torrey.   You're always in the process.   How would you assess the way you played today?  
TIGER WOODS:   I played well, I really did.   I hit a lot of good shots out there.   As I said, I didn't make a bogey out there.   Unfortunately it's the nature of the format, and I'm not advancing.  
   
 Q.   A lot of guys would have won their match if you had played with a lot of other players that won their match.   Is that frustrating?  
TIGER WOODS:   It's just the way it goes.   I've seen matches won where a guy shoots 7‑under par and he's going home.   I remember at LaCosta there was a match where a player shot 7‑over and won.   It happens.   You know, it's the nature of the format.   You've just got to beat the guy you're playing against, and I didn't do that today.   Chucky won the match.  
   
 Q.   A few days before your next event at Honda.   What is your plan the next few days?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, go get warm.
