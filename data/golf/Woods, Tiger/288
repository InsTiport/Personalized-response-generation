 Q.   Talk about your round.   
TIGER WOODS:   It wasn't my week.   I didn't play well and didn't make anything.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
TIGER WOODS:   No, I didn't have a feel for my lines.   And my line was just off.   I didn't have it today.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, we're just trying to play for position, going into East Lake.   Obviously it's the reset.   There's two different resets.   Obviously after Chicago it's important that I'm in the top five, hopefully first.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, pretty much a little school, ballet, dance, Tâ€‘ball, soccer.   I've got a busy week.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
TIGER WOODS:   Absolutely.   Well, I think it's just the people here, the spirit.   Obviously the tragedy they had, it's pretty tough.   It's unfortunate, it's just one of those things that have happened in our society and happened to us and just because we're not from this area, this is our way of trying to support people in this area that have had to live and endure.
