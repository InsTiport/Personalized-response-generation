   TIGER WOODS: Well, I didn't really get anything going my way today. I played a lot better than what my score indicates. I hit the putt really well and just nothing kind of went.  
  
  Q. No birdies here today. A couple of the key shots, the second shot at 13?  
 TIGER WOODS: Man, that was a sweet shot, that was a nice sweeping 4-iron in there. I hit that -- I thought it was a perfect shot. Then I ended up with probably one of the worst places you could put it. We thought about putting to the left and having our 30-footer up the hill. I said, I feel pretty good about my short game, I'm going to try this pitch. It didn't come out and I ended up making 6.  
  
  Q. And the third shot at 15?  
 TIGER WOODS: I had to make sure I carried it far enough and it went in.  
  
  Q. This has traditionally been the toughest day for scoring. Is that a little bit of seeing what the golf course is going to give you for the Tournament that year?  
 TIGER WOODS: Well, the way the golf course plays now, you don't really shoot low rounds here anymore. You've just got to plod along. It's playing more of a U.S. Open than it is a Masters. I mean, there's really only one roar I heard all day, and that was Poultie's eagle. But other than that, it was really quiet.  
  
  Q. Still in good shape, though?  
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, I am.
