  TIGER WOODS:   I was just a touch off.   And that's fine.   I was still in the ballgame.   Today I got off to a bad start and never got it going early and unfortunately put myself out of it.  
   
 Q.   Your numbers with fairways were good.   Your numbers with greens in regulation were good.   It seems when they changed the setup on the greens that that might have thrown you a little bit, true?  
TIGER WOODS:   Not really, no.   I was just a fraction off.   As I said yesterday it was amazing how many times I got just a half club, right between clubs all day.   And also yesterday I had trouble with the speed.   Today I felt great on the greens.   Unfortunately I got off to a bad start.  
   
 Q.   What's your state of mind after something like this happens?  
TIGER WOODS:   A lot of positives to be taken away from this week.   A lot of positives.
