  Q. Birdie, eagle start there?   
 TIGER WOODS: I got two skins. So it's a good start.   
  
  Q. How do you feel out there today?   
 TIGER WOODS: Feel good.   
  
  Q. Neck was fine, no strain, ready to go?   
 TIGER WOODS: Yes.   
  
  Q. Ready to defend?   
 TIGER WOODS: Yes.   
  
  Q. Five times?   
 TIGER WOODS: Absolutely.   
  
  Q. Phil didn't want to talk about the rivalry with you just then. Is that -- you don't embrace that either? Or how do you feel about it?   
 TIGER WOODS: If we're playing match play or we're playing matches one on one, like Federer and Nadal do, that's a totally different deal. We may be in defense, but we may not all be in contention at the same time. When we are, then we go at it. But it's getting to that point. It doesn't happen very often.   
  
  Q. But he's here to take your ranking, though, isn't he?   
 TIGER WOODS: I think that's how it works. I'm not sure. I don't follow it.   
  
  Q. Does that motivate you to re-establish your dominance out here?   
 TIGER WOODS: I just want to play four rounds.   
  
  Q. And did today give you anything, or was it just a mess around, have fun day?   
 TIGER WOODS: It was just a total mess around. It was having a good time. I haven't played with Rory yet. It was fun to see him play in person.   
  
  Q. Did you get anything out of it?   
 TIGER WOODS: I was surprised how fast the greens were. They're nothing like the putting green. They're probably another foot and a half faster than the putting green. You're going to have to be very careful. Hopefully, it doesn't rain too much, and we get a chance to play, and hopefully the greens stay at this speed.   
  
  Q. So is Rory the next big thing, or is it too early?   
 TIGER WOODS: There's a bunch of guys out there. Ryo, Rory. Those are two guys that are still pretty young. Still got a lot of golf to be played. Give five, ten years and see what happens.
