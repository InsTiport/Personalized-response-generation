 Q. Tiger, 67 today. You said earlier in the week you just wanted to get to the second nine on Sunday to give yourself a chance. Do you feel like you played well enough today to win? 
 TIGER WOODS: Well, we'll see. Right now I'm one back, and we'll see what Adam does.

 Q. As you sit here now, do you feel like you're back in the thick of things, in the fight, the way you played today, especially in the opening nine, going out in 31?
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, I'm one back. We'll see what happens. 

 Q. Are you going to now go in to get something to eat, go to the range? What's your plan?
 TIGER WOODS: I'm going to go eat. I'm starving.
