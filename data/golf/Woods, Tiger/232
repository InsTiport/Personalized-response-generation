Q. Just sum things up the three days to this point.  How are you feeling?TIGER WOODS: Made a lot of mistakes.  I've made two doubles and two triples.  But on top of that I missed a lot of shots for opportunities for birdies, and consequently I'm 3-over par.Q. Do you attribute that to the layoff and all that?  Is it taking you some time?TIGER WOODS: I'm starting to get the flow of the round, the flow of playing again.  But still I've just made too many mistakes.  You can't run up high scores like that and expect to contend, especially when the conditions are this benign.  Most of the scores are 3-under par or better.  I certainly didn't do that.Q. (Inaudible.)TIGER WOODS: Yeah, as for Bob, yeah.  I've known him a lot over the years.  Even from my amateur days when I came over here.  He's been fantastic to me.  We've had a lot of great conversations about golf.  It was always fun picking his brain about the game, how it's evolved and how he believes it should be played.  I'm going to miss him very much.Q. (Inaudible.)TIGER WOODS: I'm having a hard time understanding you.  Bob, his accent is a little thicker.
