Q. Explain what (inaudible).
TIGER WOODS: Well, it's kind of one of those moments where I thought that his ball might have gone back in the rough.  But the way I was looking at it, it was probably in the fairway and I'm going to need three to halve the hole.  And I was trying get up there close enough to where I was make him have to put a little pressure on that chip shot coming down the hill.  And I see him in the sand, so that was a bonus.  And to sneak a win out of that hole, basically carried the momentum from the two previous holes, and I happened to make one at the next hole.
Q. As it stands there's a very mouth-watering prospect that the whole world wants to see tomorrow, potentially yourself against Rory.  What are your thoughts on that match?
TIGER WOODS: Yeah, you know, I was fortunate enough to have things kind of go my way today.  I needed to have two things happen, I needed to win my match and I needed to have Aaron beat Sneds.  And so I'm very fortunate to move on.  And potentially Rory tomorrow morning.  That's going to be a lot of fun, if that happens.  And I'm sure both of us will be ready for it.
