TIGER WOODS:  It was a long and frustrating day. There was a good bit of bad weather out there and I just had to deal with it. I had to hang in there and grind away and just be as patient as possible because the golf course being as wet as it is, it was hard to make a bunch of birdies.

I made a little run on the back nine and let it slip away at the end with a bogey at the 16th and dumped it in the water on 18. But overall I am very pleased. I am right there in the ball game, only two back and weÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve got a long way to go and I am only two back.

I am feeling good enough. My mind is a little frustrated! I didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t really get anything going today until probably on the eighth and got more comfortable and hit some better golf shots on the back nine.

I didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t really know what to expect when I got here. I played the ball as it lay in the Pro-Am and the ball was picking up mud on every hole so itÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s hard to control your shots to the green. The ball in hand makes a big difference. You can be more aggressive and you only have to watch out for too much spin.

I had opportunities but hit a terrible shot at the 16th and ended up making bogey and didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t feel comfortable with my club selection on 18 and hit a 5-wood and came out of it and made a good save and to have finished two over for the last three holes would have left a really bad taste in the mouth.
