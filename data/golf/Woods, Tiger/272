Q.   You have clinched the Cup for the United States; how satisfying is this victory today in?
TIGER WOODS:   It feels good.   It was a team effort this whole week.   We really played well, and gave ourselves a really nice lead going into the singles, and it was a tough day, tough conditions, rain, wind.   It was tough all around. 

Q.   How much of a struggle was it with your back? 
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, it acted up on 14 coming in.   On 14 on in, it just kept getting worse and worse.   It's a little tight, but I'm sure we can find some swing lube later for this. 

Q.   You talked about it being a team effort; how much fun do you have playing in these events in?
TIGER WOODS:   Oh, we have a great time, you kidding me?   This is why when you first experience it, you want to get back on these teams each and every year.   It's just a lot of fun. 
It was a long week but it was worth it.   We did it. 

Q.   What was hurting, lower back? 
TIGER WOODS:   It's the same thing as it was at Barclays.   Went out on me at 14 and from then on, it just kept getting worse.   But, you know, hey, I got a point for our team so that's all that matters.   We played a lot of holes and a lot of start, stopping the last couple days, so a lot of guys on our team are dinged up, and unfortunately I was one of them.
