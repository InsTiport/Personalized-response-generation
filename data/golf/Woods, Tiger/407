Q.   Talk about the tough conditions out there.
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, it was slip have I out there.   Peter was telling me all day, guys were blowing it ten feet past the hole.   Didn't make me feel any better.   I played the way I needed to play today.   I played a beautiful round of golf, and unfortunately just didn't clean up on the greens, having four 3‑putts.   I've never seen greens change like this; to go from what they were yesterday to today.   The grass even seems slippery.   Gary out there on the first hole, he put his putter down and it slipped, we had a little bit of a chuckle about it.   It was unbelievable how fast they got. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:   I'm sure it will be fast for them tomorrow.   Some of the greens have grass.   Some of them are a little bit on the dirt side.   You know, they are right at the limit, but again, they have enough moisture in them.   But they are not where they are repelling where you can't hold the ball on the green, but they are just slippery once you start putting. 

Q.   Back okay? 
TIGER WOODS:   Back felt good today.   Got great treatment last night.   Got great treatment this morning.   It was a little bit stiff starting out warming up, but once got flowing and sweating, it was okay. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:   Same thing. 

Q.   Were all the greens like that   inaudible. 
TIGER WOODS:   Boy, those things were quick, and even though uphill putts seemed a little bit on the quick side, you know, all week this putting green over here has been a foot faster, maybe a foot and a half faster than we do on the golf course, and all of a sudden that putting green is actually slower than the ones on the golf course, and that was a bit of a shocker, at least to our group. 

Q.   Do you remember a course changing this much over 24 hours? 
TIGER WOODS:   Mm‑mmm.   Mm‑mmm   (shaking head no). 

Q.   Is this good for you being so far back? 
TIGER WOODS:   No‑‑

Q.   If the greens‑‑ because it gives you some type of advantage. 
TIGER WOODS:   You know, it's one of those things where I think if I played a really good round of golf tomorrow, and anything can happen, these finishing holes are not easy.   It was nice playing a couple of holes up, I don't think they will have the tees up like they did today. 
Even 17 was up to the front pin and I don't think that will be the case tomorrow.   I think it will be probably the back side of that tee box to the back left pin. 
So you know, it can be done.   We have two par 5s on the front side and they are both reachable with irons, you can drive the ball in the fairway.   A couple other easy holes in there, as well. 
So guys, if you look at some of the scores going out this morning, some of the guys were 3‑ , 4‑under par on the front nine, but that was it.   They didn't really do much on the back nine.

Q.   Do you remember 3‑putting three times in nine holes, how hard is it not to let frustration set in?
TIGER WOODS:   Trust me, I was certainly frustrated.   I kept tell myself I'm right in the ballgame and no one was going anywhere.   Nobody was running away with it.   Nick got it to 11‑under par and now he dropped back; I think he's at 10. 
The guys were not running away with it.   We are all bunched together.   This golf course lends itself to being bunched and all I need do is hang in there, be patient today; and I figure if I clean up the back nine, post 1‑ or 2‑under par on the back nine, I'm right there.   And at one point, I was; I was three back of the lead.   Unfortunately I didn't stay there but hopefully tomorrow I can put it together. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:   You know, what I felt like I hit good putts but my speed was awful.   I don't remember blowing putts by 8‑ to ten feet.   Peter was saying, a bunch of guys were doing that today.   So that was a bit of a shocker. 

Q.   Can you talk about your‑‑
TIGER WOODS:   Now that's what I'm talking about.   It's nice to be the West Coast Yankees, isn't it.   Now I know what Joey feels like every year.
