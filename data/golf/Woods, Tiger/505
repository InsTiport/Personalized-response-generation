   TIGER WOODS: I'm looking forward to going out there with Stricks again. We have done well. Tomorrow is alternate-shot, and you know, we have got a good team ahead of us and we are going to obviously try and earn a point for our team.  
  
  Q. You guys have obviously a really good history together in both The Ryder Cup and The Presidents Cup; what is it about you guys playing together?   
 TIGER WOODS: I think we feel very comfortable with one another. We know each other's games. We both read putts exactly the same way. That certainly helps. And I think it's just that we have been friends for so long that we just go out there and we just feel very comfortable just teeing it up and playing.
