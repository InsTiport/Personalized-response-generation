   TIGER WOODS:  I just had a hard time making the adjustment. 

 Q.  Have you made any adjustments to your putting stroke at all? 
 TIGER WOODS:  No.  I haven't made anything.  I've just -- no adjustments, I just need to get the speed of these things a little better. 

 Q.  How tough is it playing out there today? 
 TIGER WOODS:  It was playing tricky.  The fairways were quick, a lot of the pins you couldn't fire at.  They're basically repelling some of the pins, and you just had to make sure you played safe and then try to two-putt from there, but there also were some great pins where you could be aggressive and go right at them. 

 Q.  6-under pretty impressive? 
 TIGER WOODS:  Great scoring, considering the wind was up when he played yesterday, and then came up towards probably the middle of his round today.  So Rory played beautiful to shoot that.
