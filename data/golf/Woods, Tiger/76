 Q.  Talk a little bit about the match today.  
TIGER WOODS: Yeah, it was difficult conditions out there today.  The wind was pumping and if you went around there with no bogeys, you probably would win your fair share of holes.  We both made a couple of mistakes out there, but he made a few less mistakes than I did.   
 Q.  Feelings going into tomorrow?  
TIGER WOODS: Well, I don't know what the Cantlay match and Wise are doing back there, but all I can do is hopefully get a point tomorrow and see if that's good enough.
