  Q. Your thoughts on a match where you were 2-down early on and played incredibly well to come back.   
 TIGER WOODS: Francesco got off to a quick start, but I just stayed patient. I just felt, stay calm, stay patient, stay within myself and keep doing what I know I can do. And it all turned, and I did.   
  
  Q. You were part of an incredible fight back at Brookline, similar circumstance here, away from home and two points down, was there a sense you could do this?   
 TIGER WOODS: Absolutely. We've done it before. Some of the guys that part of that team, assistant captains and players were a part of this team. We have been there; we felt it; we experienced it. Talked to the guys last night, how it all got rolling. And you know, Stricks was down early but he turned it around. It was a good start.
