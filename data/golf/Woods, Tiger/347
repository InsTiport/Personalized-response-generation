Q.   Just some thoughts on what you did get in today?
TIGER WOODS:   We didn't get in much.   We got in two holes, and hopefully the course will be drained, and we can get after it tomorrow.

Q.   Do you just continue doing what you're doing?   Does something like this have a way of not bothering you or do you have a way of not letting it bother you? 
TIGER WOODS:   At least we got a little activity in today, so we're not completely stagnant.   We've dealt with this before.   We had that fog delay in San Diego, and this is part of playing outside.   We've got to deal with conditions like this.
