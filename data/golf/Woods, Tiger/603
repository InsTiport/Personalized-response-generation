 Q. Obviously a disappointing week, but can you just talk about what's going on out there and today's round?
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I drove it terrible, hit my irons terrible, didn't putt well, and it added up to a lot.

 Q. Is there anything positive to be taken out of this week, playing this weekend, for heading into the PGA?
 TIGER WOODS: No, not right now.

 Q. I know the question everyone wants to know, is the No. 1 being in jeopardy on your mind or have you thought about it or any reaction to that? 
 TIGER WOODS: Well, if Phil plays the way he's supposed to this weekend, then he'll be No. 1.
