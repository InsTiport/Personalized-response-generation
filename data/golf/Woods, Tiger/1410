TIGER WOODS:  Well, I played well for most of the day.  I hit a lot of good, solid shots.  And I had a lot of really good putts that just didn't go in.  That's just the way it goes sometimes.  You put yourself there, and sometimes they go in; sometimes they don't. 
 
Q.  As you're standing on the 17th tee, you knew you had to make it.  (Inaudible).
 
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I saw that Weirsy dropped down to 12, which meant that even if I made birdie there, that I could still either force a playoff or win outright because he's got to play that hole as well as 18.  Not too many guys are making par on 18.  So... I just figured if I can get the ball into play - which I didn't do - and then I went from there.  It happens.  
 
Q.  It seems like it went from bad to worse down there, didn't it?
 
TIGER WOODS: Yeah, I hit two good shots.  Every ball I've hit in the water, though, has been good shots.  It's just indicative of the hole.  It's not a very well-designed hole.   And, unfortunately, if you look at -- just walk along the bank, look how many balls are in the water.  
 
Q.  What do you think about Lee Westwood clinching the European Order of Merit?
 
TIGER WOODS: Lee played well.  He obviously went out there today and knew what he had to do.  He did it.  He got the job done, finished second.  Hat's off to him, because he played really well all year long.  I mean, he won a lot of tournaments.  And not only that, when he didn't win, he was in contention a lot of tournaments.
