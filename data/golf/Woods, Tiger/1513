Q.  Feel a little better today, Tiger?
 
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I feel a lot better. 
 

Q.  And the situation overall, were you into it mentally today as opposed to yesterday?
 
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, yesterday was a day where I was thinking about my Dad all day.  I didn't want to play because, as I say, there are more important things than golf: my dad's health.  But today I knew the situation was under control, and my dad is feeling a lot better, so I felt I could come out here and focus on my game. 
 

Q.  It's amazing what kind of mental game this is, in more ways than one?
 
TIGER WOODS: When your thoughts and prayers are somewhere else, it's kind of tough to play. 
 

Q.  Can you tell us about your round today?
 
TIGER WOODS:  Overall, it was pretty good.  I let it slip away at the end on the back 9; it could have been a lot better.  But it's just Southern Hills.  It reaches up and bites you if you're not careful.
