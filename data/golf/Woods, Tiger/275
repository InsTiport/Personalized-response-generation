 Q.   Another long day but you're down a couple holes, first talk about your morning match you guys won.   
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, we played well, and it was a tight match.   Guys were making a bunch of birdies, and it was nip and tuck to the very end.   
   
 Q.   And then I guess you're 3‑0, second time you've been 3‑0 in Presidents Cups, talk about how your week is going so far?  
TIGER WOODS:   So far 3‑0.   Obviously we need to get on our horse tomorrow.   I have a makeable putt tomorrow on 10 so hopefully we can turn that match around and get us a point.
