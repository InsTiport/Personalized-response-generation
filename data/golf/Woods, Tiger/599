 Q. Talk about conditions out there, how tough were they?
 TIGER WOODS: It was tough out there, certainly. Blowing pretty good. Had to be very patient. 

 Q. Good scrambling on 2, 3, 5. 
 TIGER WOODS: That's the way it was. Had to hang in there and did a good job with that. 
 You know, unfortunately I missed a short one there at the last one I played, 6, but other than that, it was all right.

 Q. And the two shots on 5 and 3. Those lies looked horrible. 
 TIGER WOODS: It was a weird tee shot with the wind the way it is, and you hit either 3-wood, drive, take something off of it, it's going to go into the water through the fairway. It was a good 5.
