Q.   Just talk about your round today.
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I didn't play very well today.   I didn't hit it well and didn't make anything.   So it added up to 1â€‘over today.

Q.   Is there something specific that you can point to?
TIGER WOODS:   I just didn't have it today.   I just didn't hit it well, as I said.   I didn't make anything.   Just one of those days I had a bad day at the wrong time.

Q.   Was the course a lot different today?
TIGER WOODS:   No, the course is gettable, that's for sure.   A little soft.   The greens were so receptive.   A little bit on the slower side.   You could be very aggressive and not have to worry about anything.
Unfortunately I just didn't put it together today.
