 Q.   Tiger, 4‑under par today.   Quickly comment on the day, if you can?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I played well today.   I hit a lot of good shots out there today.   You know, I made a couple putts out there, but more importantly, I got up‑and‑down.   You know, it was a day in which we haven't really played this golf course where the ball goes this far.   It's usually not warm, so that was a little bit of an adjustment today.  
   
 Q.   How were the greens today, Tiger?   
TIGER WOODS:   Oh, they're perfect.   Absolutely perfect.   We only have 30 guys, so there is no traffic.   But, man, they're up to speed.   Downhill, down grain, and occasionally downwind putts.   They just keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling.   It's imperative to keep the ball below the hole, if you can.  
   
 Q.   You say you played well today.   Do you think you could have gotten more out of your round?   There were a couple of putts there.   
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I probably could have gotten a couple more out of it, but I was almost right on my number what I could have gotten out of it today.   I hit a couple of really good putts that lipped out. Other than that, it was a really good day.
