 Q. Looked like a lot of putts didn't fall, but overall you still have to feel good about how you played.
 TIGER WOODS: I played well today. So did DJ. Unfortunately we just didn't make enough putts. And you know, it's all about making putts in match play, and we didn't do that. Hit a lot of good ones, though.

 Q. You said this a bunch of times, sometimes you play good and lose and sometimes you play bad and win, and that was probably the case today; right? 
 TIGER WOODS: It was, it was, definitely. Jim was saying in there earlier that he did not play well this afternoon. So it's just one of those things where that's how it all turns out, but hey, right now we have got a nice lead and hopefully tomorrow we can get the four and a half points we need.
