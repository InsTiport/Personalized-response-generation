 Q.   This is a course you obviously do well at.   Did it feel good to get under par?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, it certainly could have been a lot lower, but I'm pleased with the way I hit the golf ball today.   I didn't do anything great and I didn't do anything poorly today.   It was just a solid round today.  
   
 Q.   How is the golf course?   We haven't had much rain up here.   
TIGER WOODS:   It's chasing.   The fairways are starting to get a little bit chasy.   The greens are somewhat receptive.   I wouldn't say great, but somewhat‑‑ they're making ball marks, but they're running out, that's the thing.   With this much pitch, I think these greens have got to be near 14 right now.   It's tough, and they had a few Sunday pins, which we were kind of surprised at, and tomorrow's dots are not going to be any bargain, either.   We'll see what the weather does tonight and how much it softens it up.  
   
 Q.   Do you like it like this?  
TIGER WOODS:   Absolutely.   This is‑‑ we wish we could play every golf course we play on TOUR firm and fast, but it doesn't always work out that way.   It allows you to create shots and forces you to do some different things and land the ball on specific numbers.   
   
 Q.   There seems to be a real genuine affection for you.   Do you feel that?  
TIGER WOODS:   I've always loved coming here.   I love just playing this golf course and this area has been incredible to me over the years.   I was surprised at how many people came out yesterday on a Wednesday and supported this event.   Today they came out in droves again, and they've always supported Jack's event, and I think it's going to be the same thing on the weekend.
