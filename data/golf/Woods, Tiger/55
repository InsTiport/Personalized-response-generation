 Q.  How much was that a test of will out there?  
TIGER WOODS: That was a grind.  Wow.  You know, as you know, Pebble Beach, you have like the first seven holes and you can get it going, and then after that it's a fight.  And I kind of proved that today.  Just kind of hung in there.   
 Q.  It's a tough game.  We can't bring our complete game every day.  And to salvage that round, we have to bring something, and you brought your putting?  
TIGER WOODS: I did.  I feel like I putted well.  I was trying to just kind of hang in there today.  It was just one of those days.  And Rosie proved that the golf course can be had.   
 Q.  Wow.  
TIGER WOODS: You know, he struggled there for a little bit and then fought it off.  And what an incredible finish.   
 Q.  How big was the par putt and the par at 14?  
TIGER WOODS: That was --   
 Q.  Looked like par the whole way, didn't it?  
TIGER WOODS: It was one of those weird things.  I was trying to -- I probably shouldn't have tried to fly it that far back, and I clipped it.  And I was just trying to hack out and take my medicine and walk away with 6 and happened to make a putt.   
 Q.  Do you hit any more balls?  Do you putt?  What do you do now?  
TIGER WOODS: I'm going to do more media, and then I'm done for the day.
