 Q.   How good does this one feel?  
TIGER WOODS:   Oh, it feels fantastic.   It was a long week.   It was a tough week for the staff.   They busted their tails off yesterday, so we only had to play 18 holes today.   It could have been really tough.   With this heat, everyone that came out yesterday and worked all throughout the night so that we were able to play.   We got it in yesterday, and today was, as I said on the green here, it felt like it was just a lot of pent‑up energy.   Everyone wanted to come out and scream and yell yesterday, but there was no one out here.   Some of the guys on the putting green were funny this morning.   Out of habit they were tipping caps after we'd make a putt and putting their hand up.   It was pretty funny.   And there was no one out there.  
   
 Q.   You've passed Jack Nicklaus now, second most PGA TOUR wins.   What does that mean to you?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I've had a pretty good career.   To do it at 36, I feel like I have a lot of years ahead of me.   I've had a number of good years in my career so far, and I feel like I've got a lot more ahead of me.  
   
 Q.   You said earlier this week in your short game you were struggling a little bit.   How do you feel like you did this week?   
TIGER WOODS:   Oh, fantastic.   I made a little bit of a tweak, but the bunkers were a little bit heavy this week, and my 60 is not made for this type of sand.   I have another one that has a little more bounce, but the fairways are so tight that I didn't feel comfortable hitting pitch shots with my other 60, so I had to alter my technique out of the bunkers when I had a chance.   But I feel like I really controlled the putter well this week.   I had a lot of good putts, and I had a lot of‑‑ for some reason I had a lot of putts that were downhill, big, breaking putts, and I hit a lot of good putts this week.
