 Q.  After 13 you were never really able to get anything going.  Was 15 where it really turned? 

 TIGER WOODS:  Yeah I had a chance there.  I had to hit some kind of miracle shot around that tree. 

 But I hit a crappy shot and ended up in the water and still somehow was able to make five.  So I kept myself in the ball game. 

 Q.  You haven't had a lot of disappointing Sundays around here.  Give us some perspective on this one. 

 TIGER WOODS:  Well, this one's not disappointing today.  I threw this tournament away on two days when I had two good rounds and I went bogey, bogey.  So four bogeys in the last two holes basically cost me the tournament. 

 This golf course was playing very difficult.  You just had to keep plodding along, give yourself as many good chances you possibly could on birdies.  Because they're very hard to come by. 

 Q.  Were the scoring conditions better today? 

 TIGER WOODS:  They were.  Definitely.  The pin locations was a little bit softer.  They didn't quite, they were probably one or two steps from where they normally are.  So they gave us a break which was nice.  And gave us a chance to go out there and score. 

 Q.  (Inaudible.) 

 TIGER WOODS:  It still wasn't easy.  Look at the scores out there today.  I'm sure there weren't a whole lot of rounds under par today again. 

 I had a chance this week.  I lost it with two bogey, bogey finishes in two rounds.
