  Q.  Talk about your round?   

 TIGER WOODS:  I threw away a good round of golf.  I wasn't sweeping it very good.  Putted pretty good.  It's playing dry and fast.   

 Pins I thought were a little friendly.  It will be interesting this weekend, with the course playing so dry.   

 I've got to organize a few things.  I had it right there.  Then threw it away.  Can actually roll the ball out there.  1999 was probably the dryest I've ever seen it.   

 I had a tough putt on 16 for par.  Low is only 69 today.  Looked on computer coming out and saw guys were three and 4-under.  Earlier guys had it a little harder.
