TIGER WOODS:  I drove the ball a lot better this week overall.  I hit my irons just terrible and I made absolutely nothing all week.  So I hit a lot of greens, but I wasn't close at all.  And then missing absolutely everything.

So it was not a very good week on the greens.
Q.  So how do you get ready for PLAYERS?
TIGER WOODS:  Practice.  We've got plenty of time.  We've got three more days before game time, so there's plenty of time.
Q.  Is it something    inaudible?
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, definitely, just go out there and get some more reps and make sure it's solidified by Thursday.
Q.  Inaudible?
TIGER WOODS:  It's still good.  When I do it right, I hit it great.  It's just a matter of doing it right and I just didn't do it this week.
Q.  Of all the places to play, you probably have the oddest track record here.  It seems like you're ten groups from the leaders or in the last group, got any explanation for that; sometimes it brings out best of you?
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, it does, it's one of those things.  It's either feast or famine at Bay Hill.  I don't know why, it's just been that way.  Hopefully I can play a little bit better in the future.
Q.  Surprise you to learn that Arnold just said on NBC that he's thinking of cutting a couple of the par 5s down to par 4s and going to a par 70?
TIGER WOODS:  I think it would be very good.
Q.  Why is that?
TIGER WOODS:  This golf course really isn't a par 72 for most of the guys anyway.  16, normal drive, you're hitting 5 iron, 6 iron in there; that's not really a par 5.

So, yeah, I can understand him doing that.  I think it would be a good change.
