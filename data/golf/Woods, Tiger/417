 Q.   Nice playing out there.   Just get some comments on your round and your week as a whole.   
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I played well today.   I hit a lot of good shots and never really sniffed making a bogey all day.   So that was a good day.   
You know, playing with Kuch today was a joke.   Twenty putts on the today is not too bad, three chip‑ins.   It was amazing.   I never saw the guy all day, and we had the same score.   Good stuff.   
   
 Q.   Pretty confident going into next week?  
TIGER WOODS:   I feel very good about where I'm at.   I'm excited about it.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel any better about your putting after the struggles the first two days?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I putted well the last two days, which was good.   I made some putts.   And more importantly, I hit the ball on my start lines, and that's something I did not do the first couple days.   I misread a couple, but that's just the way it goes.   But at least every putt was starting on the right line, and that's something that I'm very excited about going into next week.  
   
 Q.   Overall, too, it seemed like the way you hit the ball all week was pretty solid.   I think today other than a couple of fringes, you only chipped once off a green.   Would you just talk about how you feel about the long game going into next week?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, my tee‑to‑green game today was I thought pretty dialed in.   I hit it‑‑ I was hitting it long, I was hitting it straight, and my irons I was shaping both ways in all different trajectories with the wind blowing.   That was about as absolute high a score as I could possibly shoot today.
