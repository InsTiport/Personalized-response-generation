  Q.  Regarding his start?   

 TIGER WOODS:  I had a two way miss going.  I couldn't hit it either left or right...   

 The 9-iron at 12, the wind got it.  I just hit a terrible shot on 13.  I turned a 90 into a 74.  Yesterday I let a good round get away and today I salvaged a bad one.   

 The whole idea is to never make a double here.   
  
  Q.  What happened on number 13 when a birdie flew right over you on the tee shot?   

 TIGER WOODS:  A birdie flew right over me and I stopped my swing somehow.  I felt like I broke my back, my neck, my arm....   

 I don't know how baseball players check swing.   

 You just plod along and try and put the ball in the right spots.... and don't have any wrecks out there.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the conditions.   

 TIGER WOODS:  It is as dry as it was in '99 except they added 500 yards and a billion trees....   

 The greens are getting that sheen....   
  
  Q.  Regarding his position going into the weekend and being five back of the leaders.   

 TIGER WOODS:  They aren't going anywhere.  They aren't going low here.  I played with Paul Casey and he played a great round and shot 68.  You're not going low here.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the young guys on the leader board and Amen Corner on Sunday?   

 TIGER WOODS:  I always like it this way.  With the condition coming up we will all have to grind.  It doesn't matter whether you are a rookie or a veteran.
