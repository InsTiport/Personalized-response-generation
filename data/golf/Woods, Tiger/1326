 TIGER WOODS: Wind was definitely coming out from a different direction than when we played here before.  When you are not all that sharp the wind magnifies it.  That's exactly what happened today for me. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:  Got to be realistic.  It could happen.  Unfortunately it did happen.  Sometimes you come out sharp.  Couple years ago I shot 61 first round.  But you never know.  Today was definitely one of those rounds where I wasn't as sharp as I needed to be. 

Q.   How tough were the conditions?
TIGER WOODS: It was difficult, but not extremely difficult because the greens are soft, you knew that if you have the ball in play, you could still shoot a good number like Frank did today.  He played great and he shot a good number.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS: Just about everything.  I know what I am doing wrong in my swing.  It is hard to trust it especially when you have some of the tougher shots left-to-right and you have to start the ball in the correct line.  I wasn't shaping the ball properly at all today. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS: But it wasn't that easy out there either.  The scores aren't going to be extremely low today.  But I could have done  --

Q.   The R&A and USGA came to a compromise today.  (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS: Kind of surprising they would do that, no doubt about that.  Our game has always been one where everybody plays under the same rules.
