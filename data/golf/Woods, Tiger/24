Q. What were your impressions of playing with Bryson today, and were there one or two shots that stood out to you that he hit today?
TIGER WOODS:   He didn't really step on any today.  He hit a couple good ones but nothing that he stepped on because the front nine doesn't really allow it.
Q. Did he try and explain anything to you about what he's been working on, and how did those conversations go?
TIGER WOODS:   No, I never asked and we didn't really talk about it.  We talked about a lot of other different things and just had a normal practice round.
