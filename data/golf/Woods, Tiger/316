TIGER WOODS:  To be able to be incarcerated for that long
  and come out and run a country with humbleness and humility.  Just
  the aura that he exudes, unlike any person, as I said, I've ever
  met.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
  TIGER WOODS:  You try to.  Everyone tries to be that way,
  and there's only so many people that have been able to be -- to
  influence the world like that.  He impacted the world, not just
  for his generations, but for future generations to come, just the
  way he handled everything.  And that takes a very special person.
Q.  Are you surprised by the number of guys that are out
    there competing and contending at that level?
  TIGER WOODS:  No, because South Africa has always been
  golf rich in history, always produced great players, from Bobby
  Locke to Gary Player.  And this generation is inspired by Ernie,
  and he's carried the torch for a number of years, but they always
  had a high level of players for a very long time.
  And I think that given obviously the weather has a lot to
  do with it.  You're able to play golf year-round down there, that
  helps.  There are certain places in the States that are the same
  way, Australia the same way.  You don't have as many people, but
  having the opportunity to play golf year-round certainly helps
  your golf.
