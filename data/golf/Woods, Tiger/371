 Q.   Can you tell us what happened?  
TIGER WOODS: I thought my ball was embedded, so I called Martin over.   He agreed.   But Andy (McFee) ruled that I had broken an infraction there and consequently got a two‑shot penalty and I had two shots.   
   
 Q.   You didn't get a chance to look at the incident; you're just taking Andy's word that the incident was correct?   
TIGER WOODS:   Andy feels the way he feels about it, then I broke the rules.   
   
 Q.   Is it a different ruling on the PGA TOUR or is it the same?   
TIGER WOODS:   I don't know, I'll be honest with you, I don't know.   Andy said that the ball wasn't embedded because it was sandy‑based.   As I said, I called Martin over to verify it, and we both agreed it was.   We thought it was embedded.   But evidently it wasn't.   
(NB: The ball actually was embedded but the crucial point is that it was embedded in sand from where there is no relief   Rule 25/2).  
      
 Q.   Do you know if somebody rang in to identify it as an issue?   
TIGER WOODS:   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   How disappointing, battled away so bravely to make the cut, how disappointing to miss the cut in this fashion?  
TIGER WOODS:   It's tough because I didn't get off to a very good start today and I fought and got it back.   I was right there and I felt that if I had close to even par, I had a chance going into the weekend, being only eight back.   Evidently, it wasn't enough.   
   
 Q.   What a disappointing way to end the first couple of days.   Can you tell us exactly what happened at the 5th?   
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I thought my ball was embedded, so I called Martin over.   He agreed.   He thought it was embedded.   Evidently it's sandy‑based and doesn't call for an embedded ball there.   So Andy gave me a penalty here, and I missed the cut.  
   
 Q.   Are you annoyed at yourself for that?   
TIGER WOODS:   No, that's why I called Martin over, is to make sure that‑‑ we thought it was embedded.   So I had a player come over and verify it, and evidently I broke a rule.   Consequently, I get two shots.   
   
 Q.   What most concerns you about the way you played over the first two days?  
TIGER WOODS:   I didn't hit it particularly well.   I putted great but just didn't hit it very good.   I was struggling with that.   I fought hard.   I fought hard today.   Got off to a bad start and I battled back and got it to where I thought I could play the weekend, and thought I might have a chance, just post two low rounds.   But I won't be able to do that.  
   
 Q.   In terms of the way you're expected to play when you teed off here‑‑  
TIGER WOODS:   Obviously you want to be in the lead, so I'm not in the lead.   I have some work to do, and next week I'm playing at Torrey, and obviously it will be different weather there this year, so going to go back and get ready.
