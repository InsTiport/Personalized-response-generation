Q.  Long day today, a lot of waiting.  Can we get your comments on the entire day?
TIGER WOODS:  No one is really happy right now.  It's been a long day, and I wish we would have gotten it in, but we'll come back tomorrow and finish it up and wait around for a while and start it up again.
Q.  Fast start for you, three birdies in the first four holes.  Just comment on the round if you can.
TIGER WOODS:  I got off to a quick start, hit a couple putts early, got it going.  From then just lipped a couple out, was close to making some more birdies, but just kind of hung around.  I made a nice save on 11 to keep the momentum of the round going, which was nice.  Unfortunately I made bogey on 15.
Q.  What was the key on the day like this, just patience?
TIGER WOODS:  Lots of patience.  We've done this before and we did it all at the beginning of the year.  I think every week we had a delay at the beginning of the year.  This is something we're accustomed to.
Q.  Co leader going into tomorrow.  Just comment on that.
TIGER WOODS:  Well, I'm in position, but then again, I didn't really put myself in very good shape on 16, so hopefully I can escape with a par there and make something happen the last couple of holes to put myself in it.
Q.  Just briefly can you take us through the birdie on 2?
TIGER WOODS:  2, I hit a driver and hit the cart path on the left, which was nice, a bonus.  I hit a 7 iron in there and two putted.

3, I hit a 2 iron off the tee, hit 9 iron in there to    sorry, pitching wedge to about eight feet, made that.

4, I hit a driver and a 9 iron to about ten feet.

13, I hit driver and a 60 degree wedge to about six feet.

Bogey on 15, hit a 6 iron left of the green, hit a decent pitch to about eight feet and missed it.
