 Q.   When you finish a round like that, where you hit all the greens‑‑ but you still score, what does that mean to you?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I hung in there.   I got off to a great start in yesterday's second round.   As I said yesterday, I lost it in the middle but started to get it back at the end and I got one today, which was nice.   Now I'm resting up right now, I'm only five back.  
   
 Q.   Encouraging to know that it wasn't the neatest round but you still‑‑  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, wasn't the best part of‑‑ the middle part of the round certainly was not the best ball‑striking for sure.   As I say, I cleaned it up towards the end, and this afternoon is going to be a tough afternoon.   It's going to be windy and blustery and it's going to be tough.  
   
 Q.   You've seen the conditions already.   Do you have a target number already going into the afternoon?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, definitely.   I'm not telling you, but yes, I do.   
   
 Q.   Looked like the back felt better this morning, I assume that's treatment?  
TIGER WOODS:   All good.
