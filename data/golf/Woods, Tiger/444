 Q.   Talk a little bit about the round, you've got to be happy where you're at, but you left some out there.   
TIGER WOODS:   I'm pleased with the way I played today.   And yeah, I missed a couple out there, but overall I knew in these conditions to shoot something in the 60s was going to be a pretty good effort.   Pleased with my round.  
   
 Q.   You've had a lot of success here.   Do you feel some of the magic out there today?  
TIGER WOODS:   I just felt I had to control my ball.   That's all I was trying to do today.   It's not about magic or past experience, it's just about controlling my golf ball and staying in the present.   You know, that's one thing you have to do on this golf course.   It forces you to do that because there's no letup in it.   You know, yesterday we had hard and fast conditions; today they're soft, but it's windy and blustery and gusty and it's swirling in those trees.   It's two different tests but nevertheless great tests.  
   
 Q.   Your mindset heading into tomorrow?  
TIGER WOODS:   Just be patient, same thing.   I don't think this is‑‑ the guys aren't going to go out there and shoot a bunch of low rounds out here.   This golf course is hard.   The pin locations for tomorrow are going to be difficult.   So it's going to be another good test.
