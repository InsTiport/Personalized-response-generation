 Q. 7-under through the last 11 holes. What was the turning point after No. 7? 
 TIGER WOODS: Oh, I don't know. I just kept staying patient. That's all I was just trying to do. I was trying to get to under par at the turn, that was kind of the goal, and then pieced together a good back nine, made a couple more and got a little bit hot.

 Q. I know a lot of people pay attention to the birdies, rightfully so, but how important was the par save at 11?
 TIGER WOODS: Oh, that was huge. That was huge. I hit an awful tee shot, hit a decent second shot and just an atrocious putt. It was a big putt to make, and I poured it right in there.

 Q. We saw some reactions from you we haven't necessarily seen in a while. What beyond your place on the leaderboard does this day give you heading into the weekend here?
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I'm three back. I'm right where I need to be. I've closed the gap after yesterday's round, and hopefully tomorrow I can piece together another good round, stay patient and plod my way along.
