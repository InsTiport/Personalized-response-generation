 Q.   Can you assess your round?   Hot start?   
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I did, I got off to a great start today and then lost it the middle part of the round and made too many mistakes.   Didn't hit any greens.   Consequently, made some bogeys.  
   
 Q.   Is your back okay?   Any issues?   
TIGER WOODS:   I'm a little sore right now, yeah.  
   
 Q.   What are your expectations as far as your health?   
TIGER WOODS:   I'm going to get treatment right now as soon as I get done here with you guys and be ready for tomorrow morning.  
   
 Q.   Long day today, but we're used to those this year on TOUR?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, you're not lying.   Tomorrow will be longer.   With the early start and then the repairing, go back out‑‑ but I don't think the weight will be too long tomorrow and we'll get back out there and finish it up.  
   
 Q.   Did the pain increase throughout the round?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Any specific shot stuck out?   
TIGER WOODS:   Every one.
