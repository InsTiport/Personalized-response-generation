Q. Tiger, you almost got there in the end.
TIGER WOODS: Not really -- the closest I got was fourth I think. The way the golf course was playing, it was hard to make birdies and very easy to make pars and with Mark being out in front like that, all he has to do is make pars to stay ahead of Paul, so he's doing the right thing back there.
Q. What do you take out of this week then?
TIGER WOODS: Overall it was a decent week. I had only five holes where I dropped shots and for a week that's not bad -- I just didn't make enough birdies to win the tournament.
Q. Such an important stage of the season coming up -- how do you feel you are prepared for the weeks ahead?
TIGER WOODS: Very good. You know this year so far I've played every tournament inside the top ten which is great and hopefully I can continue playing that way.
Q. Finally, if Mark wins does he get a lift home in the plane?
TIGER WOODS:  He's guaranteed to get a lift -- you know why. I hope he pulls through. We all want to see him doing it. He's 47 versus Paul who's a bit younger. Paul's got a few more years at it while Mark doesn't. I hope he does pull through. He's playing well, he'S doing all the right things and you can tell he's full of confidence.
