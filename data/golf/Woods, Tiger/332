Q.   It took a while to get the second one, but now you're tied with Freddie?
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, he can't make fun of me anymore.   It was a tough battle.   I felt like I was in control of it after I birdied 12 and gave it right back at 14 with a double.   It was game on, and anybody could win the golf tournament.   I made a huge save at 15 and then a nice up‑and‑down at 16 and a big two‑putt at 17. 

Q.   How tough was it coming down the stretch knowing you needed to get a birdie, and were you trying to just‑‑ if I can post one ahead of everybody, is that what you're looking for?
TIGER WOODS:   I figured if I birdied 16 and parred in, I thought the worst I'd do is playoff.   I just thought 17, not too many guys were going to go for that pin, especially with the wind off the left.   You're afraid of kind of losing it, tailing off over there, and 18 is a birdie hole if you can get it in the fairway. 
But still, it's 18, and it's a left‑to‑right wind, it's in, and even though the tees were up a little bit, the pin was up, but it's still a very tough hole.

Q.   First nine holes you gave yourself eight birdie chances, a lot of lips.   How hard was it to keep your focus there?
TIGER WOODS:   Well, Joey and I were talking, I said, maybe we need to mis‑hit a putt, maybe then they'll go in the hole.   I hit pure putts and they just didn't go in.   That's just the way it goes.   Stick with it.   I did it all during yesterday's round, and this morning I hit pure putts, as well.   Just continue with it and they're going to go in, and I finally made one there at 12 and I made a huge one there at 15.
