TIGER WOODS:  I didn't hit it close at all.  I hit a lot of greens.  Like I said, yesterday I needed to give myself a lot of looks and I did.  Unfortunately they were from 20, 30 feet on every hole.  You know, that's fine if you're leading the tournament, but I wasn't leading the tournament.
Q.
Everybody felt the swirling winds.  Was it tough to get close today?
TIGER WOODS:  With the wind blowing this hard, it's sometimes a two-club wind out there so it's tough to try and get a ball close.
Q.
Disappointing, the winner maybe shot just better than par and you didn't make a move?
TIGER WOODS:  Well, we figured that 9 or 10 was going to be the number.  I just couldn't get the ball close enough.  The only time I did was probably on No. 5.  I hit it in there stiff and I missed it.  Other than that, I really didn't have a whole lot of birdie opportunities.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It's just the wind is blowing out there.  It's tough to -- at least I found it tough to get it close.  Stuey and I were talking about that today, that it just all depends on the timing of the gusts, which one you get, and for some reason I just had a hard time getting the ball close.
Q.
Is it a guessing game out there?
TIGER WOODS:  When the wind is blowing this hard it is, because you're trying to hit the ball to a specific number and the wind is blowing this hard, it's hard to do that.
Q.
You had that stinger shot off the tee today.  Was that part of what you worked on Friday?
TIGER WOODS:  No, it wasn't even close to what I was working on, but I had to hit it.  It's nice to be able to do it the proper way instead of the improper way, which I've been doing it.  When I do it the proper way, it feels a lot better.
Q.
Is it nice going into the British knowing you have that shot, feeling right?
TIGER WOODS:  You've got to hit all shots at a British Open, not just that one.  You can get suckered into hitting the low ball all day.  The problem is you start doing that and then you can't get the ball in the air.  One of the things I work on for the British Open is trying to be able to hit the ball really high and really low so I've got a whole arsenal I can work with out there, and hopefully I'll have that two weeks from now.
Q.
Are you happy with that new driver?
TIGER WOODS:  I am.  I'm hitting it out of my shadow nice (laughter).  I hit it well this week, and it is going further because it is obviously -- it is going straighter.  The ball is coming off faster, which means it's coming off with less spin, which means it will go straighter.
Q.
Stephen Ames has had eight Top 10 finishes.  You've got to give this guy props.
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, he played consistent all year, and it was just a matter of time before he broke through.  I believe this is his first win, and what a great tournament to win.  Such a great history behind this tournament.  It's a fantastic tournament to have your name on.
Q.
That shot at 11, was that indicative of what the wind was doing or did you just pull it?
TIGER WOODS:  No, I overhooked it actually.  I was trying to draw the ball back into the wind and make sure I didn't lose it way right and I just overhooked it, overdid it.
Q.
What would you say is the overall state of your game going into the British Open?
TIGER WOODS:  I'm very happy with it.
Q.
Can you expand on that a little?
TIGER WOODS:  No (laughter).
Q.
Are you happy with the adjustments you were able to make on Thursday and Friday?
TIGER WOODS:  Yes.  You know, you guys saw me play on Friday.  I wasn't swinging the club very well.  Then yesterday I hit it very well, and today I hit it good.  I just didn't get the ball close, and unfortunately I was putting well, but when you've got 20, 30 footers, it's hard to make a run at the leaders.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, a long time.  If we would have not had the greens soft, it would have been one heck of a test.  Obviously as firm as they were on Thursday and Friday, this golf course would have played unbelievably difficult.
Q.
(Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  A few things.
Q.
Going back to that, do you feel like -- last year we asked you the question if this is a U.S. Open course, and you said you didn't really think so.  Has your mind changed at all?
TIGER WOODS:  No, I don't think so.  They would have to toughen the greens up to make it a U.S. Open venue.
Q.
The poa annua grass is too slow?
TIGER WOODS:  We were talking about that today.  Stuey and I couldn't believe that they were this slow for the entire week.  Generally they are a little bit stringy, which is how poa reacts, but it was different this year for them to be that slow.  I don't know why they were slower this year.  Maybe they might have had more thatch to them.  Maybe they didn't roll them, I don't know.  But they said they were slower than in years past.  Even last year when we had a bunch of rain, they were still faster last year than they were this year for some reason.
