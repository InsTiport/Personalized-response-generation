  Q. That's a new way to play 18.   
 TIGER WOODS: Man, it's just the only shot I had, either that or pitch out backwards, leave myself just over 200 yards coming in. I figured if I could get up on top of that hill and get over the rise, I've got a downgrain lie, and at worst have a 60-degree sand wedge in.  
  
  Q. Watching the entire day, it seemed like there was no chance to get a rhythm going, whether it was with your swing or with the putting. Did you feel anything in the last few holes that gives you hope for the weekend?  
 TIGER WOODS: Well, the wind died down, which was nice. It was quite a fight to try and figure out what was going on out there. I mean, it was just swirling all over the place. When it died down around 14, it made things a lot easier coming in.  
  
  Q. You've come from six back to win, you're seven back now. What needs to happen tomorrow to get yourself in position?  
 TIGER WOODS: Well, obviously I've got to make a few more birdies and eliminate the mistakes, hit the ball a little bit closer than I have. You've just got to stay patient. I mean, this golf course, anything can happen. You can come back pretty quickly here. You've just got to keep being patient and keep hanging in there.
