Q.  About the round, Tiger, things that you were happy with, things that maybe you weren't. 
TIGER WOODS:  I felt like I hit the ball well today.  I hit so many good putts that didn't go in.  As I said over here, the greens are slower than they were on Tuesday by quite a bit, a little bit softer.  It's tough to get a feel of where to land the ball on the green:  let it run or not let it run.  Once you get the feel of that, I was able to make some birdies.

Q.  Is it going to change day to day?
TIGER WOODS:  I don't know.  I've been here.  Today we started out with the wind left to right on No.  1.  It changes, comes out of the right.  It was tough to get a feel.  Came out two different directions today.

Q.  David Duval said a lot of the pin placements he thought were for the normal Trade Winds. 
TIGER WOODS:  Correct. 

Q.  Did you feel that?
TIGER WOODS:  Without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  That's one of the things that we just got a weird day with the wind.  It was different.  You had to adjust; you had to hit different clubs off tees, try to get the ball in the same area.  It felt a little awkward at times.  Some of the clubs you're pulling because you're not used to hitting those kind of clubs.

Q.  Kind of day where one guy found a way to get double digits. 
TIGER WOODS:  I feel like I'm swinging the club well.  Even though Weir went pretty well, some other guys went pretty low, I'm still right there.  I just need to continue to play solid and give myself some chances on these greens.
