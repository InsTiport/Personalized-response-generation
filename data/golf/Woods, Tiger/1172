TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I do look at it because you keep telling me about it each and every week.  I get asked if I view anybody else, so I am aware of the point spread because you guys are telling me about it.  Other than that, I'm still trying to work on my game, trying to improve, trying to win.  That takes care of itself.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Not really.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  If you win a major championship, everything takes care of itself.
Q.  There have been a number of guys that have challenged the last four or five years -- (inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:  Well, back in 98 or 99 I was playing well, Duval was playing well, Davis was playing well, and Justin was right up there, as well, so it was just a different core of guys.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Well, right now, but before it was Duval, Sergio and myself.  It changes.  That's just part of -- as long as you're still in that conversation, you're doing all right.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It's pretty high actually.  I'm pretty pleased with some of the things that I'm showing, some of the things that I'm doing.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Any time you're playing well you can shoot good numbers.  You need to have confidence you can hit the ball right where you want to, make a putt and everything is going your way.  It's a building-up process.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It's great to be back.  The golf course has changed a little bit.  The rough is up a little higher and it's very soft obviously from the rain yesterday, but other than that, it's the same golf course.
Q.  What have you learned from your golf swing -- (inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:  It's the same hole.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to rectify when I was out there playing.  You can hit things on the range, but when you've got water left, water right, bunkers, the wind is blowing, you've got to hit the ball into a tight, tight spot, yeah, it makes it a little more stressful.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I have not received anything from Byron.  He sent me a letter of acknowledgment just to keep up the good work and keep playing hard.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  That's a good one, but I can't tell here (laughter).
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Since my engagement?  I'm doing all right this year, I think.  I've had a pretty good start to the year, won one tournament, World Golf Championships.  More than half of the tournaments I've played in have been Top 10s.  I've had another solid year.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I've been hearing ever since I started dating Elin that my game has gone downhill.  We moved in -- she moved in with me and we started living together in 2002 and I won two majors that year, so I think I'm doing all right.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Well, I think it's one of those golf courses that's right in front of you.  There's no hidden tricks here.  All the trouble is right in front of you, you know where to put it.  I think more than anything I've played well the final day.  Three straight years or something like that, 64.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I've had some nice little rounds on Sunday.  I think that's why my scoring average might be a little bit lower.
Q.  How is your preparation for the Open?  Do you start like about a month out?
TIGER WOODS:  It starts right after Augusta.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I've never won there.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I don't know.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I don't know if you can enjoy that.  Sometimes things are not as they should be.  It's part of the territory.  Norman was up there ranked No. 1 in the world for the longest time and he was held to a different standard of golf.  When Duval had his run, he was held to a different standard.  It's just part of being on top.  That's just the way it is.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It was certainly the firmest greens I've ever played on because amateur golf you don't play on anything like that.  I've played on greens just as fast as I played at Augusta that year, but I've never played on greens that firm.  I guess the crosswinds there were different than what we played in the practice rounds, so it was different trying to get accustomed to playing links golf in a U.S. Open style.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Is that right?  44 yards?  Well, it will be a little bit different.  (Inaudible).  Justin was one of the last ones, he was one in 97.  It's going to be different to see what happens when we go back there.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  The rough is there and they try to put a premium on accuracy and precision and control.  You play golf courses like Congressional, that was more of a power golf course.  Ernie and Tom Lehman both hit the ball a long ways, Monty is not as long but he's one of the best drivers of all time.  We don't play too many golf courses that absolutely have to be U.S. Open, but every now and then we do play on them.
Q.  What do you think about Adam Scott's peak?
TIGER WOODS:  It's pretty neat.  I remember seeing him, but I never put the face -- it was great to be out there and we had a lot of fun.  He's a great guy.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Well, hopefully I'll be better than that.  That's the whole goal is to become better than what you were.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Do you play golf?  Well, you understand.  You understand you're always trying to get a little bit better.  Every now and then you get a little bit out of it.  We're at a professional level, but it's no different, professional and amateur level.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  That is completely incorrect because when I played my best, I always drew it, and when I played poorly, I would go to a cut, but my natural shot has always been a draw.  I don't know why people think I'm trying to draw the ball more now.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Well, of course it doesn't play.  The shaft lays down and of course it's to the inside.  That's not my action.  A lot of guys fight that.  If you look at Vijay's swing, he's the same way.  He drops the club inside and he releases it pretty hard with his right hand.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  That was 99.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  No, probably not because it's not going to be a complete overhall of the golf swing.  I changed my golf swing completely from 97 to 99.  My grip was a three-knuckle grip to a very neutral grip.  I'm hitting across and on a plane.  My stance was completely different, my posture was different.  I changed a lot of different things.  This is just minor little adjustments.  It's not a complete overhaul of my golf swing like I did in 97, 98, beginning of 99.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Trying to restore?
Q.  Getting it back to where it was.
TIGER WOODS:  I think I can be better than that.  That's the goal is to always become better.
Q.  Do you happen to recall at Shinnecock, between there and Bethpage, both on the island -- (inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I played practice rounds that year with three of the top name guys, and we did not find the same type of reception versus what we did at Bethpage.  They were two totally different atmospheres.  They are certainly more golf knowledgeable at Shinnecock.
Q.  Did you enjoy the Bethpage crowd?
TIGER WOODS:  It was tough.  It was tough at times, but you had to focus, block it out, move on and play the game.
Q.  Did you enjoy the week at Shinnecock?
TIGER WOODS:  No, I didn't enjoy it.  I didn't make the cut, I didn't win, and I wasn't even there.
Q.  What did you do to your wrist?
TIGER WOODS:  I strained two ligaments in my wrist.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  If I stayed in there, I would have.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Well, I think he certainly has some talent.  He has a lot of maturing and playing and growing as a person.  People don't realize what it takes to become a professional out here.  It takes that attitude of being a professional.

It's a lot more demanding on your time, and I think that that tug at you versus amateur golf and college golf, playing out here, those are things that people grow accustomed to.

I'm sure he'll determine that this year and gain more experience from that.  I'm sure playing major championships will help because there are a lot more distractions at the majors than there are here.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  As long as I'm part of that conversation, I'm doing all right.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It all depends how I'm swinging that day, from shot to shot, situation to situation.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I'm going to go out and fire at a lot of pins.
