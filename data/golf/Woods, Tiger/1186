TIGER WOODS:   Well, I didn't hit a very good tee shot, obviously.  I was trying to hit just a soft one in play and just kind of spun out of it.  Hit it way right.  Wind caught it even worse.  So it just wasn't a good shot.

From there, I tried to battle back and I just didn't hit it quite good enough to put myself in position to make putts, and when I did I, missed it.  I just need to obviously hit the ball better and putt better.  So, you know, a lot of work.

Wasn't quite as good obviously as it was yesterday.  That's just the way golf is sometimes.  You go out there and you just don't have it.  Today was one of those days unfortunately.
Q.  Do you expect conditions to get tougher on the weekend?
TIGER WOODS:   They won't.   Not with the pin locations tomorrow.  They are not all that difficult.  The greens being as soft as they are, the guys are going to continue to go low.  The greens aren't that fast.  They are slower than they are most years, so you can go ahead and take a rip at putts.
Q.  Given the conditions , what do you need to do?
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I just need to go ahead and just play well and hopefully put myself in position where I can give it a run on Sunday.  You know, the leaders go ahead and play well, hats off to them.  I just need to take care of my own business first.
