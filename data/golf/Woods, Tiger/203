 Q.   You started a long ways back today, what was the game plan coming out?  
TIGER WOODS:   I needed to shoot probably 31 on that front nine, and make a little bit of a run.   I missed three shorties in a row, 2, 3 and 4 and didn't gather any momentum after that.   And basically I struggled from there.  
   
 Q.   We saw you catch a root, apparently?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   How are you feeling?  
TIGER WOODS:   A bone kind of popped out and the joint kind of went out of place, but I put it back in.  
   
 Q.   Really?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Wow.   Okay.   In terms of the week, how would you evaluate your performance and how things went?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, considering where I was at Torrey and Phoenix, to make the complete swing change and rectify all the faults and come here to a major championship and contend, I'm proud of that part of it.   
Just wish I could have made a few more timely putts and moved up that board.   
   
 Q.   Do you already know when you're going to play again?  
TIGER WOODS:   Not going to be for a while.   I have a little time off, and go back to the drawing board, work on it again, and refine what I'm doing.   I really like what I'm doing, I got my distance back, and everything is good.   
   
 Q.   Good to have you back out here.   
TIGER WOODS:   Appreciate it.
