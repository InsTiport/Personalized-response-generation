  Q. 1-under first round, looked like your round was in pretty good shape, just didn't get the job done there at 6, 7 and 8?  
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, I let those go. I lost my tee shot to the right on 6 and 7; made bogey there.   
 8, I hit a terrible tee shot there. I was fortunate enough to make par there, but you've got to make hey on the par 5S here. You don't get too many opportunities around this place and I only made one birdie on the par 5s.  
  
  Q. How is the course playing?  
 TIGER WOODS: They moved the tees up quite a bit today. We were way up on a lot of holes. They definitely have a lot of room to go back. As of right now, only 6-under is leading, so I'm sure it will be a little bit tougher, with the wind and the weather coming in, we'll see what happens.
