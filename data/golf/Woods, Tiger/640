 Q. How would you assess your chipping and putting?
 TIGER WOODS: Chipping, I chipped well the last two days. I didn't putt well yesterday. I putted much better today. I felt like I hit my lines all day today.

 Q. After 36 holes, how does your performance compare with your expectation?
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I want to be in contention, and put myself right there. As of now, I'm two back, and we've got 36 more holes to go.

 Q. You know this course, you know the cauldron, you know what the weekend is like. Assuming no one reaches double digits, where you are right now, how do you assess that position?
 TIGER WOODS: Well, even if they do reach double digits, if someone gets up there, that's fine. This golf course you can make up shots and you can lose shots. That's one of the beauties of it. It should be an exciting weekend.
