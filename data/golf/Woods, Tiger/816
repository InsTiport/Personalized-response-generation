  Q.  A couple quick comments.  You started out, got on the 1st hole, came back in, and now you are at 4-under through 11.   
 TIGER WOODS:  Well, I made a couple putts.  I don't know how.  I hit them up there and they bounced all over the place and somehow went in.   
  
  Q.  How about the conditions out there when you went back out?   
 TIGER WOODS:  They were soft, and the greens were interesting (laughing).   
  
  Q.  When you made the one at the 3rd, can you just talk about that?   
 TIGER WOODS:  That putt was bouncing all over the place.  It bounced to the right, I thought I missed it; then it bounced left, I thought I was going to miss it left, and then somehow it wiggled back to the right up the hill and it went in.
