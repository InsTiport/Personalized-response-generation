   TIGER WOODS: I didn't drive it very good, I didn't putt good, I didn't hit my irons good. Other than that, it was a good day.  
  
  Q. What was the main problem?  
 TIGER WOODS: I just didn't have it today. Just didn't -- wasn't really doing what I was supposed to be doing out there swing-wise, and then wasn't releasing the putter blade out there and was dragging it a little bit. It was a bad day all around.  
  
  Q. What's your mind frame going into tomorrow?   
 TIGER WOODS: Well, I'm going to have to shoot something good tomorrow, hopefully move up a little bit, obviously get off to a better start than I did today.   
  
  Q. That kind of a start, what does that do to you mentally?  
 TIGER WOODS: You've just got to battle back. I tried to stay focused on what I was doing out there, and I got it back a little bit. I felt I could have got a couple more out of it actually.   
  
  Q. Do you have a number in mind that you're going to have to shoot tomorrow?  
 TIGER WOODS: I'm obviously going to have to shoot something pretty good tomorrow, just get some kind of momentum going. Obviously we've got easy holes starting out, but we don't know what kind of weather we're going to have. A lot is depending on what the weather does. But either way I'm still going to have to shoot a good score.   
  
  Q. What do you need to do now?  
 TIGER WOODS: Practice and rest, too. It's a combination. You can't just come out here and hit balls forever. You've still got to get some rest.
