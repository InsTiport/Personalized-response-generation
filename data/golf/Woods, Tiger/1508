  Q.  Talk a little bit about the round today.  I know it was
a disappointing finish. 
 
 TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I didn't play well coming down the stretch.
 And, obviously, it cost me.

 Q.  Could you tell us about the round and take us through
what happened today?

 TIGER WOODS:  Played well early.  And, somehow hit some bad shots
on the back and didn't maybe the putts I needed to make.

 Q.  Three rounds left.  You can recover quite well?

 TIGER WOODS:  We'll see.  I am hitting it well.  Made some good
putts early.  I need to get off to the same start tomorrow and
hopefully I will be able to keep it going and get myself in some
red numbers tomorrow.

 Q.  Could you tell us what you hit into 18?

 TIGER WOODS:  7-iron.

 Q.  Did the wind catch it?

 TIGER WOODS:  I just hit a bad shot.

 Q.  What happened on 11?

 TIGER WOODS:  11, I just hit a wedge again, hit a bad shot. 
Hit it left, and it flew on the downslope, and.... there it went.


 Q.  How long was that putt on 18?

 TIGER WOODS:  About 20 feet.

 Q.  Can you give us just birdies, bogeys?

 TIGER WOODS:  No.  It is too many.

 Q.  Obviously, that is not the way you wanted to end the round.
 What is going through your mind right now?

 TIGER WOODS:  You don't want to know.

 Q.  Do you think that this is one of your most disappointing
rounds?

 TIGER WOODS:  I have had some disappointing rounds lately.  And,
this is one of them.

 Q.  What are you going to do right now?

 TIGER WOODS:  I don't know.

 Q.  I mean, you plan to hit balls or --

 TIGER WOODS:  I don't know.

 Q.  How will you try to get ready mentally tomorrow?

 TIGER WOODS:  I will be all right tomorrow.  I will try and figure
out what went wrong today, what I did wrong and tomorrow hopefully
make some corrections and tomorrow play well.  Tomorrow the conditions
will be a little bit easier.  We will have perfect greens early
in the morning.  And, hopefully, I will get the putter rolling
and make some putts. 

 Q.  Do you feel like this has been something in your swing
that --

 TIGER WOODS:  I don't know.  I don't know.

 Q.  Do you plan to talk to him (Butch Harmon) tonight?

 TIGER WOODS:  I don't know.  Is that it?

 Q.  Thanks, Tiger.
