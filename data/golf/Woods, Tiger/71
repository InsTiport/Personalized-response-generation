It was not that you played poorly, Tiger, your opponent did pretty well toward the end, too.
TIGER WOODS: He played well in tough conditions.  It was not easy out there and we both hung around, we both kind of grinded away around the golf course.  And he played the last three holes pretty solidly.
Q. Can you feel good about getting to this point, though, and overall just the big picture?
TIGER WOODS: Yeah, it's a little hard for me to take that in perspective at this moment right now, I just walked off the golf course.
Q. What will your next week look like in terms of Masters prep?
TIGER WOODS: I don't know right now.  You've got to give them a little time to calm down.
