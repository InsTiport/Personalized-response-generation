Q.   How hard was that?
TIGER WOODS:   Well, it was hard for me.   I didn't play very well today.   I didn't hit it very good, didn't make anything, kept blocking every putt.   So it was a tough day.

Q.   Level of frustration as the round plays out like that?
TIGER WOODS:   I didn't start off very good and I didn't finish very good.   So the bookends weren't very good and in the middle part I was grinding just to kind of hang in there around par.

Q.   (Inaudible)? 
TIGER WOODS:   Not joyous, that's for sure.   It's just one of those weeks where I didn't quite hit it well enough and didn't make enough putts.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Oh, it's a fantastic golf course.   Unfortunately I just haven't put it together at the right time.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Pressing it?   Yeah, at times when I'm underneath the trees and I'm in bunkers and trying to get up‑and‑down, yeah. 
As far as overall game plan and the way I'm playing, I've been there in enough of these things where I've been right there in the back nine on Sunday with a chance.   As far as that's concerned, no.

Q.   (Inaudible)? 
TIGER WOODS:   That's golf.   We don't play well every week.   Unfortunately I happened to get at that what happened to be this week.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, you know, Sean and I were trying to work on it last night.   I just haven't got my takeaway right; it's off.   Consequently the whole patterning is off.   Just one of those weeks where it's just a fraction off, and a fraction off on a setup like this, it's going to cost me.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
TIGER WOODS:   It very well could.   You know, I hit‑‑ when I do it right, I hit some sweet shots.   And when I do it wrong, I'm struggling. 
On top of that, I've‑‑ today for some reason I kept blocking every putt.   I burned a few edges out there and it just wasn't quite right.
