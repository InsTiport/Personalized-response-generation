 Q.   Considering how you were feeling prior to the round and during the round...   
TIGER WOODS:   Well, wasn't easy and I fought hard.   That's about all I had.   
   
 Q.   Did you think of not playing?   
TIGER WOODS:   Well, I wasn't doing too good at the beginning, but I thought I could hang in there.  
If this fever just broke I thought I would be all right.   It finally broke on the front nine.  
   
 Q.   Do you have a diagnosis?  
TIGER WOODS:   No.   Sick.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)   
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah.   Yeah, that's the way it goes.  
   
 Q.   When did you lose your voice?  
TIGER WOODS:   I been throwing up for hours.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, last night.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TIGER WOODS:   No, you know me.   I like to compete.   If I can go, I can go.   I'll give it everything I have.   
This is different.   I wasn't in pain.   Just was a little bit under the weather.   
   
 Q.   Have you not been able to eat?  
TIGER WOODS:   No.   
   
 Q.   No sleep?  
TIGER WOODS:   No.   The sleep has been rough, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Did you play with a fever yesterday, too?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Which was worse, yesterday or today?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, yesterday's fever was higher, but today, you know, the nausea and the vomiting before and during the round, I didn't have that issue yesterday.  
   
 Q.   Have you dealt with a doctor at all?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, I'm on antibiotics.   Just waiting for it to kick in.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TIGER WOODS:   I hope it'll be gone soon.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TIGER WOODS:   Playing with Billy was fun.   He's a good kid.   We played fast, which was nice, so I didn't have to sit out in that heat for too long.  
   
 Q.   Does it help your game knowing you don't have a lot of time?   
TIGER WOODS:   No, I just didn't have the‑‑ initially I didn't have the explosiveness.   I was just pretty slow.   As the round built on I was starting to feel better and started hitting the ball around my normal numbers.  
   
 Q.   But did you reach back for on that last one.   
TIGER WOODS:   I did.   That was nice.   I haven't been able to do that for a while.   
   
 Q.   Mom over here so she can help you?  
TIGER WOODS:   No, my mom is‑‑ she's been sick, too, as well, so she's trying to hang in there as best she can, too.  
   
 Q.   Can you take anything out of today game‑wise when you're feeling like this, just trying to get through it?  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, not bad.   I'm only 15 back.   (Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, well, it's going to be a busy year starting middle of the year on, because if we don't have a whole lot of breaks, and you throw in a couple overseas as well.  
I'll have a pretty full schedule next year.   
   
 Q.   Think it will be any different from this year?  
TIGER WOODS:   It'll be probably slightly different, yeah.   
JOHN BUSH:   Tiger, thank you.   
TIGER WOODS:   Thanks, guys.
