  Q. It looked like that great birdie putt at 11 you were going to be able to put something together. What were you thinking at that point?  
 TIGER WOODS: I figured if I played the last seven holes probably 3-under par, I might be in it, but I just couldn't -- I just didn't make any putts all week. I hit the ball well enough to contend, I hit the ball definitely well enough to put pressure on Trevor back there, but I just didn't make any putts today.  
  
  Q. On 13, the short effort that you couldn't convert, and then 14 you make bogey there.   
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, all week I was struggling with dragging the blade through. I wasn't releasing it, wasn't getting the overspin like I normally do, and consequently you can't start the ball on line -- you can't start the ball on line on these greens, you're going to pay a price.  
  
  Q. You're three back. What will you do now?  
 TIGER WOODS: I'm going to go up there and eat a little bit. I'm a little hungry right now. More than likely -- Trevor is playing well. He had one bad hole, but he should be able to get in the clubhouse.
