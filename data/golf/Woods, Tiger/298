 Q.   Took almost 11 hours, how would you assess the day?   
TIGER WOODS:   We're done.   It was a long day, and tomorrow will be a short one, and then Saturday will be pretty much a marathon.   
   
 Q.   What's the hardest part with the stops, the starts, the delays, to be fresh and sharp when it is time to play?  
TIGER WOODS:   That's the hard part.   The first day, we didn't really have that much time to get back out there.   We had less than 30 minutes to warm up and ball in play.   The third time we came out here and restarted, we had an hour, so that was nice to basically go through the whole warm up routine.   
   
 Q.   How did this golf course play differently with the rain we had today as opposed to the scores we saw on Wednesday?  
TIGER WOODS:   Way different.   It was definitely slower.   A couple of us got a couple mud balls out there.   The greens were way more receptive.   You can be aggressive.   You could basically just fire right at it and it was going to stick, and a couple of short irons, you had to watch out actually for spin, spinning the ball back down the slopes.
