  Q.  Everything is going the U.S.'s way this morning, wondering, what kind of lift did Woody's finish yesterday do for the team?   
 TIGER WOODS:  I tell you what, he birdied the last three holes, and that showed a lot of guts to do that.   
 But we razzed him pretty hard in the team room.  That's a seen that I don't think any of us will ever forget.   
  
  Q.  What a revenge from yesterday.   
 TIGER WOODS:  We played better today.  We went out there and made some birdies and Adam and Ernie had opportunities to make putts on the front nine and get to all-square, but just didn't make the putts.   
 Then on the back nine, we made some birdies.
