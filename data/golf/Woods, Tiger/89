Q. Birdie on 10, and kind of get all-square, and you're feeling good at that point?
TIGER WOODS: Yeah, we fought back from 2-down to get it to all-square.  And then we didn't do anything from there.  They made a bunch of birdies, and we didn't answer.  And very similar to yesterday.  We were 2-up at one point, and we didn't make any birdies coming in, and they did and they flipped the match.
Q. Speaking of flips, 24 hours ago, up 3-1; 24 hours later, it's a little adversity, but still 16 matches to be played, right?
TIGER WOODS: There's a lot of matches to be played.  We need this match in the afternoon right now, or this morning session with J.T. and Jordan, we need to get that, we need to get a W there, and then play well in the afternoon.  And there's still 12 more points up for grabs tomorrow.
