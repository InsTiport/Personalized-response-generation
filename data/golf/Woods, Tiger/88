Q. Tiger, tough match, got behind early, never got over the hump.  Is there one hole you wish you could go back to?
TIGER WOODS: Yeah, you know, the tee shot 14 was big.  I didn't put it in play, and I just made the -- just got the match to all-square.  Made eagle at 9 and birdied 12.  So it was important to get the ball in play.  Didn't do it.  Made back-to-back bogeys and consequently the matched slipped into his favour.
Q. I know the week didn't go as you thought, today didn't go as you hoped.  Just sum that up a little bit.
TIGER WOODS: Well, it's disappointing because I went 0-4, and that's four points to the European Team.  And I'm one of the contributing factors to why we lost the Cup, and it's not a lot of fun.  It's frustrating because we came here, I thought we were all playing pretty well, and I just didn't perform at the level that I had been playing, and just got behind early in the matches and never got back.
