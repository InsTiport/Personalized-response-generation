 Q.   A chance to tie the match there at the end, the way it all went down, can you tell us what was going through your mind at the end?     
TIGER WOODS:   To be honest I didn't really pay that much attention.   I was trying to get my point.   I went 1‑up at 17, and I asked Joey what was going on down 18.   Because my responsibility was to be able to get my point.   And then they said that Europe has a chance to win on this hole, or retain the Cup.   
Then after that all went down, my putt was useless.   It was inconsequential.   So I hit it too quick, and gave him his putt, and it was already over.   
   
 Q.   Did you sense some type of momentum shift, and if so, when, and what did it feel like?   
TIGER WOODS:   You know, I just kept focusing on my point.   But I was 2‑down through three, so I didn't really pay a lot of attention to the boards.   Just because I had to get my own game, my own match back to where it was all‑square, if not put a red on the board.   And I didn't really start paying much attention until, as I said, 17, when everything started coming together and it looked like Europe had a really good chance of retaining the Cup.  
   
 Q.   You were on the opposite side at Brookline‑‑  
TIGER WOODS:   It's the second time it happened to me being on the fairway.   It happened at The Belfry on 17, playing Jesper and our match was inconsequential and same thing here, it's inconsequential, the Cup is already over.   So that's twice where the Cup's already been over.  
   
 Q.   How do you think it will be different once the team gets together tonight?   
TIGER WOODS:   You know, I just walked off and you guys got me, so I haven't even seen‑‑ the only person I've seen it Webb.   So I'd like to go see my teammates, talk to them, and as I said, I just walked off the green.
