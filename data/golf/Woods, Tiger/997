Q.  It was a great week weather wise.  Nothing could have been better except your golf game.  Talk about what kind of a week it was for you and for your foundation.
TIGER WOODS:  Oh, absolutely incredible, for the weather to be this good and to have these people come out.  We have a lot of people here; it's very exciting.  Again, it's what we're trying to do for kids, and I think overall this was an absolutely awesome week.
Q.  Talk about how you played.
TIGER WOODS:  Not very good at all.  It's been a long week, a long year, and it's taken its toll.  I just couldn't put it all together.
Q.  Are you looking forward to your birthday?
TIGER WOODS:  I'm just looking forward to putting the clubs away for a while.  I probably won't remember my birthday.
Q.  Are you glad this season is over?
TIGER WOODS:  I am, I am.  The stress that I had starting at the TOUR Championship, this has been a long stretch.  I've been playing a lot of golf, putting on a lot of miles.  My battery is just running a little low.
Q.  There's nothing you would change about the schedule, is there?
TIGER WOODS:  No, I could have played a little better.  When you're in contention at these events, it wears you out a little bit more.  I had a nice run there for the TOUR Championship and China and Japan and obviously in Hawaii, so real positive stretch.
Q.  Talk a little bit about your foundation.
TIGER WOODS:  My foundation?  We're trying to help kids.  We've got 3 million kids involved in the program in the country.  We've got a learning facility going up here in Anaheim, so a lot of positive things.
Q.  Anything you'll be working on during your downtime?
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I'm just putting the sticks away, not going to touch them for a while.  I'm looking forward to getting my body back to being healthy.
