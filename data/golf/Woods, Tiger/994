Q. Did you figure something out between yesterday and today?
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I actually knew what I was doing yesterday and couldn't stop it.  First day back, had a hard time, but today felt a lot better.  I did some work last night and some work this morning, and went out there and felt really good.
Q.  Were you actually planning where your shot out of the trees was going to go?
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I hit the shot I wanted to hit.  It didn't get airborne as well as I'd have liked, but overall it was pretty good.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I had to get it low.  If the tree wasn't in play there, I could get it to the green no problem, but the problem is I had to keep it low, and if I drive it too low it doesn't go anywhere.  I was between 7  and 8 iron, I hit 8 iron to make sure I got the ball out, but I kept it down too low.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I did.  It was a terrible tee shot there on 11, just pulled it.  I actually hit a pretty good tee shot there on 16, though.  I hit a good shot, a good bunker shot and a terrible misread.
Q.  A good two rounds under your belt.  How do you think that play affects you, in a positive way or a negative way?  You have you haven't taken time off in a while.
TIGER WOODS:  I needed it.  It was a little bit shorter than I'd like.  I'm very pleased that I played better today, and hopefully this weekend I can play a little bit better.
Q.  What did your eagle putt do for you?
TIGER WOODS:  It got me to 7 under (laughter).  No, it was great because I hit a bomb there on 3, and then another bomb there on 13, two putts that you don't expect to make.  You try to get them close and maybe they go in.
Q.  Have you ever had three eagles in one round?
TIGER WOODS:  Yes, I have.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  I'll tell you what, those are special days when those happen.  I don't know what I shot, but you're making three eagles, you're looking pretty good.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  On this golf course the way it's playing, it's not playing easy.  Looking at most of the scores yesterday, most of them came off the North, and I'm sure most of them came off the North again today.  It's hard to take it deep on the South Course.  Thursday and Friday, these are some of the toughest pins I've ever seen on the South Course.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  He didn't come out there.  He had to come out there on Thursday morning, so we'll have a look.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Overall it's playing faster than we normally see it.  It usually plays soft, but the fairways are running and the rough is up, but the greens are pretty receptive.  You drive the ball in play and you can be pretty aggressive.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I went back to the driver I practiced with.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  We tightened up the shaft.
Q.  What is that designed to do?
TIGER WOODS:  I hit it 15 yards further, period.  So it's hard to give up.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It was the way I was hitting it.  I was trying to get the ball in play.  If I would have hit the one I hit yesterday, I would have hit it a lot further, but when you're trying to keep the ball in play, it's nice to have a little spin to keep the ball in play.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIGER WOODS:  It's great because I just gave a shot right back at 14 and didn't want to give another one back to back, but made par there and then I gave it up on the next hole.  That made up for it.
