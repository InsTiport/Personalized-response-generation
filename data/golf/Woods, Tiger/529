  Q. It felt like you were so close today. When you look back on this round, are you going to be pleased with the way you played or not?  
 TIGER WOODS: Pleased with the way I played. I just made nothing. I hit so many putts early that looked like they were going to go in that didn't go in and also had a couple three-putts out there, so not very good.  
  
  Q. You said at the beginning of the week that your goal was to just be there the second nine on Sunday. Do you feel like you're still in position to do that tomorrow?  
 TIGER WOODS: I'm going to have to put together a good front nine and see what happens. I'm in a position where I've just got to go out there and play a good round and see what happens.  
  
  Q. You made a number of swing changes. Do they feel comfortable out there to you at this point?  
 TIGER WOODS: Yeah, I hit the ball well all day. That wasn't the problem. I just made nothing. You take away the two three-putts there, the two unforced errors there and then make a few, it should have been a pretty good round.
