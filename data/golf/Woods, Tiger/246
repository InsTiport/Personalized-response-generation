Q.   How'd it feel out there? 
TIGER WOODS: Felt a lot better today. 

Q.   Any comments or thoughts on playing more than 18 holes tomorrow? 
TIGER WOODS:   Should be a long day for all of us. Hopefully tomorrow I can get back out there in the morning, play well and work back to even par by the end of the first round. Then shoot a low one in the afternoon. 

Q. Any issues or scares when taking your first full swings in a few days then having to sit out for two hours and go back to making full swings again? 
TIGER WOODS:   No, warmup was good and I felt good all day even through the delay. I'm ready to go back out tomorrow and play well.
