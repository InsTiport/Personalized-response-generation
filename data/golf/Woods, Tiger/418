 Q.   Can we just get some comments on your round today?   
TIGER WOODS:   Well, today I hit the ball well and made some putts, so it was‑‑ I thought I was playing pretty well on that‑‑ through, I'll say, 11 holes, but I was getting killed by my playing partner.   I thought I was playing well, but he was playing better.   So it was a good day.   We both had some good rounds today, and it was good to finish up on a positive note.  
   
 Q.   Anything in particular, putting different today than the first day?  
TIGER WOODS:   I just did some work yesterday and found some alignment, some posture things and got my feel back.   My blade was releasing properly again, and it felt really comfortable.  
   
 Q.   Would you say that you have less overall angst about your game when you're hitting it okay and the putting isn't there?   Do you sort of feel like the putting is going to come?  
TIGER WOODS:   Absolutely.  
   
 Q.   It's more stressful if you're not hitting it?  
TIGER WOODS:   Hitting fairways and greens, you're shooting high rounds of 2‑under par and 3‑under par, that's a good sign.   You know, those are your worst scores you can possibly shoot that day, that's always a positive sign.   It's not good when you're shooting those scores and you get absolutely everything out of it.   
   
 Q.   I mean, actually this whole week it sort of seems like you're not that concerned or you really haven't been, it's putting, it's going to come around at some point?  
TIGER WOODS:   That's basically what it was the first couple days.   I hit the ball well enough, as I said, to be in the top 5 and could have made a run just by being in that position if I would have putted well the first couple days.   I'm not that far off and just got to play one solid round tomorrow, if we play tomorrow, and get ready for the PGA.
