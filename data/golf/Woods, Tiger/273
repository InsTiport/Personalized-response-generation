 Q.   You play here at Memorial, is it playing differently this time of year?   
TIGER WOODS:   At moments, the only thing that makes a difference‑‑ inaudible‑‑ the lies on the greens.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.).   
MATT KUCHAR:   It just didn't come out.   There were a lot of holes halved.   There were not many holes won with birdies.   We got off to a 7‑under through 11 start and they were right there with us, so it was like a club match.   
   
 Q.   Now playing Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama, what challenges do you face?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, we're used to it.   We've done this a bunch before.   Mate has been on teams and I've been on teams and we know how it works.   
   
 Q.   You guys had it going most of the round.   
TIGER WOODS:   We played really well, we were receive up through 11, and they played great.   Louis and Charl were just right with us making birdie and birdie, and Kuch topping them on 3 and 4 was huge to keep that 1‑up lead.   
   
 Q.   Talk us through how much fun it looked like you were having, you were dusting the guys in the practice round and you were way, way under par.   What's the secret here?   
MATT KUCHAR:   You get a great partner like Tiger Woods, we matched up really well together, having a lot of fun out there and making a lot of birdies.
