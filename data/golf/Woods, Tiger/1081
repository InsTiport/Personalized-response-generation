TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I didn't really hit the ball all that close to the flag.  I drove it pretty good.  Didn't have a lot of hittable birdies, but when I did I was able to make it.
Q.  Knowing there were 50 scenarios between yesterday and today
TIGER WOODS:  It's just the way it's going to be.  I hope tomorrow we're going to get started on time, but you never know.
Q.  If not
TIGER WOODS:  I took a day off.  I've been working pretty hard this year, and so I took the day off, so I went to a movie and worked out, laid low.  I came out ready to play today.
Q.  The same thing this morning?
TIGER WOODS:  You get really good at what you do on your personal time.  Basically that's just the way it is.  You have to accept it and be patient and know that the guys are going to have to play tomorrow and be ready to play when your name is called.
