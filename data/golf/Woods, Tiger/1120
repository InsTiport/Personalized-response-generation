Q.
Tiger, how are you feeling?
TIGER WOODS:  I feel a lot better today.  Certainly it's still sore, but at least I can now move and make a golf swing at it.

Q.
How much of a chance do you feel this round gives you now?
TIGER WOODS:  Oh, I'm going to need some help tomorrow.  I understand the weather is supposed to be terrible, so hopefully I can play a great round tomorrow.  I'm still six shots back, which is a long way back, especially when Ernie is playing the way he is.
Q.
You've played a lot with Luke Donald, haven't you?

TIGER WOODS:  Yeah.  Luke is a fine player.  He's just steady as can be.  He doesn't make a lot of mistakes and just goes about his business.
Q.
Good luck tomorrow.
