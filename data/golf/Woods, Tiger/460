  TIGER WOODS:   I hit some of the worst golf swings I've ever hit today, and that's all right.   I just hung in there and grinded my way around the golf course and stayed very patient, stayed in the moment.   Unfortunately that was about as good as I got right there.   I could have shot one, maybe two better, but that was‑‑ I got a lot out of that round.

Q.   You're not often in the habit of characterizing a bogey as good, but how would you describe your score on 18 considering where you were?
TIGER WOODS:   Yeah, it was another bad tee shot left, and I got it to‑‑ it was a tricky little drop there, and I somehow got a swing at it, and then from there the pitch was not easy.   I didn't have a good enough lie to go up top, so I had to take it down, had to burn it into the hill, and it came out perfect.

Q.   You have as good an understanding of your golf swing as anybody out here.   You've hit the ball so well coming in.   What did you sense on the range when you were doing your work then about what you were bringing over to the course? 
TIGER WOODS:   Old patterns, yeah, just old patterns.

Q.   Like what? 
TIGER WOODS:   Some of my old stuff from a few years ago.   I've had to try and kind of work through it, and every now and again, it pops up, and today it popped up a little bit.

Q.   How do you mend it?
TIGER WOODS:   As soon as I'm done, I'm going over there.
