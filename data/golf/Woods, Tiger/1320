 Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  I played a little better today.  I finally got a couple putts to go into the hole and consequently, I ended up in the mid-60s.

Q.  Given the fact that the next tournament you're going to play is the U.S. Open, how nice has it been to turn in a good score given that it's the last one before the Open?
TIGER WOODS:  I felt like I wasn't very far off and it was just a matter of getting the momentum on my side, getting a few putts to go in.  And I think that's what happened today.  I made a nice putt on the second hole and felt comfortable with my stroke from then on.  And it's nice when you see a couple putts go in the hole.  The next thing you know, the hole looks a little bigger and you start swinging the club a little better and I got it going. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  No, I felt like I was, I wasn't that far off compared to where I was last week.  I really hit it good last week.  And all I needed was to just to get a couple putts to go in and I wasn't able to do that all week until today.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  No, the greens are still soft today.  You can still be aggressive.  And I was hitting, like for instance on  7, I rifled a 2-iron in there and it only rolled about six feet and you don't ever see that happening around here. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  The same things I've been working on:  Keeping my swing a little more sound and work on my putting and short game.  Every facet.  You need every facet at the U.S. Open. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  I didn't do anything.  I felt like I was hitting good putts this week.  But I also hit some poor ones.  So I think a lot of that is just because I didn't see anything go in. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  No, everything was good today. 

Q.  How long was the putt?
TIGER WOODS:  About 18 feet.  A little left-to-right and it was nice to make one of those.  It was nice to get that one early. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  It was something that I don't want to have to do because you want him (Snead) to still be around.  But I think it's a way of all of us showing how much he was an important factor in all of our lives.  And I'm going to miss him because I got to know him a little bit.  I first played golf with him when I was five years old.  And that's an experience I'll never forget. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  We played two holes.  And I, he went.
And I went bogey-bogey. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  I did on the first hole, it was a par-3, yeah. 

Q.  He told you not to do it?
TIGER WOODS:  Not to do it and my dad says, you, what do you want to do and I didn't say anything, I just grabbed a club and I went and played it from out of the water.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  I had some more opportunities and hopefully I can capitalize on those two chances.  But right now my mind is looking forward to the next two weeks. 

Q.  Where was that when you played those two holes with Sam?
TIGER WOODS:  I think it was down in Encino, California. 

Q.  He was there playing an exhibition or something?
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, he was playing an 18-hole exhibition and I think he changed groups every two holes and I got a chance to play with him on the last two. 

Q.  Do you enjoy a week when you don't win but you find something or --
TIGER WOODS:  No, because I'm not that far off this week.  And today showed that.  I wasn't that far off all week.  I was just mistiming the wind.  I hit a good shot and the wind would drop off or lay down and I missed a few putts and I just never got anything going.  And today it finally happened and I didn't do anything different.  I felt the same way over the putts and the shots today and for some reason it added up to lower score. 

Q.  You kind of got a champion's ovation coming up 18?
TIGER WOODS:   That was nice of the fans.  They didn't have to do that.  But I've always enjoyed coming to Ohio, it's treated me pretty good.  And the fans have always been extremely nice to me. 

Q.  (Inaudible.) 
TIGER WOODS:  Without a doubt, I love Firestone.  I said it's one of the most classic golf courses we get a chance to play.  It's not one of those TPC courses.  All the trouble is right in front of you.  It's a long, narrow golf course and all the trouble is right there. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  It's right in front of you.  I think that's why all the players love playing the golf course. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  I think I was tied for the lead after the first round.  I think, I think so.  It was in  '98.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
TIGER WOODS:  If I'm playing well.

Q.  What do you do between now and the U.S. Open, preparation and rest-wise?  You got a week off in between.
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, just take it easy this week.  Just kind of go home and just relax.  Shut it down for a couple days and then evaluate what I need to really work on and come out with a game plan and then I'll feel ready.

Q.  Is there a combination of what works best, especially going into a U.S. Open for you.  Shutting it down early or  --
TIGER WOODS:  I know what my body needs.  I know how to get my mind and body coming together for a Major championship.  It's just a matter of doing it.  And hopefully it will happen this time again. 

Q.  Will you go to Bethpage before the Open?
TIGER WOODS:  Yeah, I'll go the week before. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TIGER WOODS:  All right.  Thanks guys.
