Q. Give us your overall assessment of how things went today?
ANDREW DODT: It wasn't easy.  Quite breezy, which made the course very different to yesterday.  I played pretty solid, though, even though I was 2-over through five or six, I just kind of told myself to hang in there and try and hit fairways and greens, and I managed to do that on the back nine.
Q. What's the big key to getting a good round out here?
ANDREW DODT: I think in the fairway, for starters.  If you're hitting second shots into the grain from the short stuff, you can get some spin on the ball.  The greens have been quite new.  They are still a little bit firm.  Stay out of the rough.  It becomes very tricky.
Q. Just talk us through that eagle.
ANDREW DODT: Yeah, good drive.  It was downwind out of the right.  So I hit the fairway and I was in-between clubs, actually.  I chose the longer club and kind of cut it up a bit and missed the green right.  My caddie said, "This is the biggest chip-in I've ever seen."    So I took the flag out and chipped it in.
Q. You have a great chance to win this golf tournament after 36 holes, you're bang in there with an opportunity.  Does that change the mind-set?
ANDREW DODT: No, I mean, a win's a long way off.  There's still a lot of golf over the next two days, especially around this course.  Course management is a big key.  You need to be in the right places and miss in the right places and the old clichÃ©, one shot at a time.  It's never been truer around this course.
