  ANDREW DODT:   Played very well, straight out of the blocks.   3‑under through three; 4‑under through nine, and then yeah, just rolled a few in on the back nine and it all clicked.   
   
 Q.   Why?   How?   After two days?   
ANDREW DODT:     I just said, I got married two weeks ago, I don't know if that's got something to do with it.   But I'm sure it has.   
Yeah, I feel last year was like a second chance, this year I just managed to get my card and this year I feel that I can come out of the blocks running and play well early on, and I managed to do that today.  
   
 Q.   You're a different person as a married man, an extra step in your stride, no confidence?  
ANDREW DODT:   Maybe.   It's only been two weeks.   It's all going well at the moment as it probably should be.   Yeah, I feel pretty good.   My game feels good.   It all clicked today.  
   
 Q.   You've got sub‑70 on your shirt, it is your first sub‑70 round here; what's happened out on the course?  
ANDREW DODT:   I played really well Thursday, but just didn't score very well.   Shot 2‑over, and even yesterday, I didn't hit it that well but scored better.   Today, combination of the first two days, it all managed to click and 7‑under was the result.  
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on that position on the leaderboard?   
ANDREW DODT:   Yeah, it's handy.   It's obviously very good position heading into tomorrow but one more round to go and a lot of work to be done.
