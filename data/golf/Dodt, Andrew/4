Q. 67 yesterday and 69 today, another great round to back things up from he had why?
ANDREW DODT: Not quite as clean as yesterday.  A little bit scratchy sort of towards the start and middle but finished with two birdies just then, which is a nice way to end the day.
Q. What was the difference out there today?
ANDREW DODT: Probably a few putts.  Didn't hole a few putts early on than I did yesterday but having said that, I hung in there.  The conditions were quite easy to be fair.  I didn't take advantage of that early on but it was nice to finish with two good birdie putts on the last two holes.
Q. Just one shot off the lead now going into Saturday, so it's nice to see yourself at the top of the leaderboard?
ANDREW DODT: Absolutely, yeah, the British Open spot is in the back of your mind, so it's driving me to pick up one of those spots to hopefully be at Birkdale next week.
Q. Wind is supposed to be blowing tomorrow, and starting things a bit earlier, so hopefully you can keep things under control if it does pick up.
ANDREW DODT: I don't really fancy being out there if it's blowing a million miles an hour.  Hopefully we get out there a little bit earlier and the good form continues.
Q. Over the last two weeks, have you learnt anything about your game and playing links golf a bit more?
ANDREW DODT: Not necessarily.  I think I've always been a pretty good wind player.  I like when the conditions are tough.  Makes you sort of get out of your own way and hit the shot that's required, so that kind of plays in my hand a bit.
