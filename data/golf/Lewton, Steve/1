 Q.  Steve, how good a start is this at Fanling?  
STEVE LEWTON: Oh, brilliant.  I played really solid tee-to-green.  I just played, well, I missed a few putts, but I gave myself a lot of looks today which was nice.   
 Q.  And an eagle 2 in the process.  
STEVE LEWTON: Yeah, that was even better.  I just bogeyed the previous hole and then hit 6-iron from 202 I think, and it was on-line, but I thought it might be really short but it just reached, so very fortunate.   
 Q.  Did you see it drop?  
STEVE LEWTON: Yes, I did.  I was a bit excited when it went in.   
 Q.  I imagine there was excitement which when you see your name moving up that leaderboard on day one, as well.  
STEVE LEWTON: Yeah, it's exciting.  Great place, Hong Kong, love being here, and long may it continue.   
 Q.  It's a tricky week.  Do you put all thoughts of that aside and just get on with the game?  
STEVE LEWTON: Yeah, trying to save my Asian Tour card for the year.  Definitely a good start and see how we go from here.   
 Q.  How are you coping in this part of the world as a nice Englishman?  
STEVE LEWTON: Yeah, it's different.  Took me awhile to get used to the weather.  First couple years was difficult, playing in 90-degree heat most of the time but the humidity was the difficult thing and the grass was difficult, different types of grass, takes a while to get used to chipping and putting.  Once you get your head around that, you have a chance.   
 Q.  And once you get away from the golf, it's quite a life, isn't it?  
STEVE LEWTON: It's very different.  It's great food, great people and fantastic places to visit.   
 Q.  Which means saving and securing this card means even more?  
STEVE LEWTON: Yeah, exactly.  Need to be pushing the next three days, so see how we get on:   
 Q.  You'll get on great.
