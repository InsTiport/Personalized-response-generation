 Q.   Just a general assessment of your round today?   
KLARA SPILKOVA:     Actually I played really good.   I had five birdies and was very, very solid, so I'm so happy.   It was a good game, yeah.   
   
 Q.   When you are preparing for this week, did you feel like you were playing this kind of golf or was it a surprise today?   
KLARA SPILKOVA:   No, I think I just played this golf before in India, so I think it's going to be very nice.  
   
 Q.   How does this course suit your game?   Is it somewhere you enjoy coming to and enjoying playing in Dubai?   
KLARA SPILKOVA:   Yeah, I enjoy this golf course, it suits my style.   The greens are very nice, very good roll.   So I made very nice birdies and very good putts.  
   
 Q.   After thinking about what you did today and thinking about the next three days, do you feel confident that you can stay towards the top of the leaderboard?  
KLARA SPILKOVA:   I really hope so, because I played really good, so I think it will be nice tomorrow and the next day.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you made an awful lot of par saves and birdies.   That must give you confidence heading into tomorrow.   
KLARA SPILKOVA:   Yeah, I hope so, because my year wasn't so good.   So I really want to finish good, so hopefully it will be good.   
   
 Q.   What was it about your year that didn't go to plan?  
KLARA SPILKOVA:   I had a few cuts, I think it was half and half.   I missed a cut and then made it.   So I really want to finish good, because I a little bit need to.   
   
 Q.   What was the key to the round for you?   What made you not have any bogeys?   
KLARA SPILKOVA:   I was just happy and at this point you have to feel good and stay with this feel and go for it.   Just keep going, yeah.   
   
 Q.   What was your target coming into this weekend?   
KLARA SPILKOVA:   I really want to finish, I don't know, Top‑10, it's going to be nice.   
   
 Q.   Next week, do you have any plans?   
KLARA SPILKOVA:   Next week?   
   
 Q.   Your birthday?  
KLARA SPILKOVA:   Yeah, I don't want to play Q‑School.   
   
 Q.   So you may go to Morocco but hopefully not?   
KLARA SPILKOVA:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   So you have to finish Top‑10 to avoid Q‑School?  
KLARA SPILKOVA:   No, I think more.   Just after this round, I want to finish better.   And then I will celebrate my birthday, my 18th birthday.
