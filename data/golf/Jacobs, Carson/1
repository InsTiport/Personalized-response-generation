Q. 139, you have to feel good about your?CARSON JACOBS: Just stride to put two good rounds, that good game plan.  Playing solid, make a lot of pars and capitalize on making good yardages and that's what we did both rounds and it feels good.Q. What was your game plan?CARSON JACOBS: Game plan was just to hit a lot of greens and I ended up hitting 17 greens.  That was my No. 1 goal and then just take the birdies when I hit it close.  I knew they would come.  I stayed patient and worked out.Q. What were your expectations coming in here?CARSON JACOBS: My expectations were to go as far as I felt like could I and just play well and see where it took me.  Didn't really set a limit.  Obviously playing in a tournament, you'd like to win, and now go in with the mind-set, just take it one hole at a time.Q. Have you played in one of these before?CARSON JACOBS: Have not.Q. Any USGA events?CARSON JACOBS: Have not.Q. Obviously you've played in a lot of college tournaments, but what's different about this than playing in a regular college event?CARSON JACOBS: I don't think -- obviously the field and the size, one of the most prestigious tournaments but there's still 36 holes to be played and then there's a cut. I just took it one hole at a time, try not to think of it as the U.S. Am.  I just tried to think of it as another round.Q. If you said you did one thing really well here the first two days to get you into match play, what was it?CARSON JACOBS: Stuck to my game plan.  Hit the ball really well.  Just hit a lot of middle of the greens, and that's pretty much what did it.
