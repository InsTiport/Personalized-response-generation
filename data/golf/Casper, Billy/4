Q.  What happened?
BILLY CASPER:  Couldn't get off my left side.  It happened yesterday.  I just woke up with it.  Couldn't make a swing.
Q.  How bad is it?  Does your back hurt?
BILLY CASPER:  I don't have any pain.  Just can't get off my left side.
Q.  Would you consider withdrawing out of the tournament?
BILLY CASPER:  No.
Q.  Why is that?
BILLY CASPER:  I have my kids and grandkids here.  I have to play for them.
Q.  Can you take us through 16?
BILLY CASPER:  I just kept hitting it to the left.  I got five balls within a nest there that's that big of round.  I was very happy to get out.
Q.  What does it feel like when you do --
BILLY CASPER:  It feels like it's just a pull-hook.
Q.  Why did you play this year; you haven't played the last few years?
BILLY CASPER:  Well, my kids wanted me to play.  Just to walk on the fairway and be in the tournament.
Q.  Are your kids proud of you for hanging in interest?
BILLY CASPER:  I hope so.
Q.  Were the galleries supportive?
BILLY CASPER:  Yeah, they are great.  We had a lot of fun out there.  They were there all the way around, five grandchildren, five kids.
Q.  Does it bother you that your name will be in the record book with the highest score?
BILLY CASPER:  I didn't turn my score in.  I have the card in my pocket and I'm going to frame it.
Q.  Did Tommy or Charlie say anything to you?
BILLY CASPER:  Charlie made nine on 15.  I said I'll make you feel good.

We were rooting for each other.  Tommy played pretty good.

I hit a good drive the last hole, couldn't even see the green.
