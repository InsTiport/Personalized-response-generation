 Q.   Your thoughts on today's round, because that's some knock, isn't it?   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I don't know how to say it, but 5‑under, I guess that's what I can say.   I've been slightly everywhere and all the times‑‑ putted some long putts that were getting up really close and then I made some good putts coming down the last.   That was basically it.   
   
 Q.   It looks like on previous days you've got it going for a little while but today you've put it all together.   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Yeah, I think three hours of sleep is better than nine hours of sleep.   Last night I was still jet‑lagged, so I only got three hours of sleep, and I guess to be feeling a little bit more soft and relaxed made me play a little bit better today.   So two hours tomorrow night.  
   
 Q.   You had some hassle getting there, there were bag delays and problems, late flights?  
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Yeah, I had some problems from Portugal coming.   I was flying from Portugal to Germany; Germany, Dubai to stay there one day with the Atlantis boys, and then playing down here.   So when I got to Dubai, nothing came and nothing had left Portugal when I arrived in Dubai.   
So I actually didn't think that I was going to be able to play this week when that happened.   It's been a week with very little sleep and a lot of worries and I'm just happy that I'm coming out on Saturday and playing quite decent golf.  
   
 Q.   A lot of worries also means you've got to do incredibly well to retain playing rights.   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Yeah, that's just a bonus.   I'm coming down here to just try to get into the top 145.   I would love to have a win.   I don't know anyone that doesn't.   So that would be a massive bonus for me and I think that I have to finish top two, so tomorrow I have to go out and try to do just what I did today and we will see what happens.   
But I think Mr.Rumford is looking really good and my fellow man, Peter Hedblom is going to do great, as well.   So two big boys to beat?  
   
 Q.   So worries aside and sleeplessness, you're fairly relaxed about things and your position here?   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Yeah, it is a long time ago that I was minus five in a tournament than I was Top‑5.   Those are the tournaments where I normally do quite well in.   When it goes to minus eight and minus 20, I don't really do that well.   So it fits for me, fantastic, so I'm really happy about it.
