  JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I actually thought it played quite easy for a while out there but then I realised it was not that easy when I saw myself on the leaderboard and then I realised that I was actually doing good.   The last stretch is very tough I think out there.   You have to play very good on 13, 14.   15 is quite easy but 16, 17, 18, those final holes are key holes out there.   I think I was 2‑over par on those so I have to be better tomorrow, and I'm three behind.   
   
 Q.   Happy with that?   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Of course I'm happy, I'm not going to stand here and lie, but I think I can do better.   
   
 Q.   Does that mean your attitude changed when you saw your name on the board?   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   It changed to the fact that I was trying to go lower.   Before that I was trying to keep hold and try to finish on a decent score.   But I got a little more aggressive since I saw.   
   
 Q.   Give us an indication of how difficult it is?  
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   It's difficult.   The course itself is playing very difficult and then with the breeze, it's just getting four times as difficult out there.   I can't hit my irons very high, so when the wind comes up, I think that just because of my poor hitting with my irons, it actually gives me a bit of benefit.  
   
 Q.   And you've said before, you like the kind of challenge and you like having to knuckle down and makes you focus all that more.   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Yeah, it actually does.   That's why I always like to play with it and always want to do something with it.   Sometimes we have to hit stock shots, yes, of course but most out here today you have to play a certain spin on it sideways and just trying to hold against the wind and don't hit too far down when it goes downwind.   
   
 Q.   I seem to recall you played pretty well here last year.   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Yeah, I think I finished well last year.   It was the same thing, I didn't think I played especially good the last day, but people kept on dropping.   So I can't give myself too much credit for that, either.   
   
 Q.   Give yourself credit because this score will stand the test of time today I think.   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I hope so.   That's why I'm here.   I'm trying to produce something and I need to get back to ThorbjÃ¸rn Olesen.   He's so far ahead now, I need to catch him.  
   
 Q.   Good rivalry between you two, isn't there?   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   It is.   Of course it's great friendship but it's always fun to have someone to beat, especially someone that you like, instead of someone that you dislike.   So it's good fun out there.   
   
 Q.   And you applauded him when he won in Sicily?  
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I definitely did.   I went out that night with my best mate and we had three drinks; we bought one drink for ThorbjÃ¸rn.   We ended up having a lot of free drinks for people, and I'm really happy for him.   Of course, that's how it should be out here.   You should be happy for winners; not feel like you are missed out or anything.   You just have to play better.
