  JOEL SJÃHOLM:   It's been so much fun.   We have been staying in a house this week, me, ThorbjÃ¸rn and Johan Edfors, and we just had such good company with each other.   The course totally beats me again, but I guess I have to live with that when I'm minus 16 after four rounds, three amazing courses like this.  
   
 Q.   He has not beaten you by much, and you say those three amazing courses, Carnoustie, here, and St. Andrews, to great effect; 16‑under is brilliant.   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Yeah, I mean, of course, it's very good, but I do want to beat him.   Because I know that if I beat him when he is playing good, I will also be up there, as well.   
So he is a very good measurement for me to keep on trying to beat, because I know how good he is, and I know how good Branden is, as well, and all the other guys, of course, but just because we have such a close friendship, it's always fun to have one specific guy that I'm trying to beat on good and bad behalfs.   
   
 Q.   A little up‑and‑down on this final day but good finish.   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   That's how I play golf at the moment.   I've always been up‑and‑down, and that's just how I play golf.   I have to focus harder on trying to get better and stay straight from the tee boxes, because I know that my putter is quite strong, and my short game has been good, except for one hole today and through the week it's been very good.   
I don't know, I'm close.   But not close enough yet.   
   
 Q.   You going to Portugal next week?  
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I'm going every week.   
   
 Q.   You're going to relish that course.   
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I'm trying myself to get myself in a good position to reach The Race to Dubai, and this has been my goal for the year.   I really need a strong finish.   I'm just happy to stand here and talk to you because that means I've done something good.
