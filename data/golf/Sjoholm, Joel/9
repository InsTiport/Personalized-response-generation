Q.   So what's the story today?   A very good story? 
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I holed out three times today.   One time was on 3.   My front nine was the back nine.   So I holed out a great chip shot from a thick lie on 16. 
I also holed out on hole No. 3 from 90 metres straight through‑‑ it was not in the hole from the start, but the greens, they are so soft, just makes it a little bit easier for us pros that we can actually try to hit it as close to the hole as possible.   Sometimes we have to carry four yards before, ten yards before, but we are trying to basically slam dunk it, and I managed to destroy the golf hole. 

Q.   Which is superb and superb that you bounced back; a couple of issues could have affected you on the card but you came back again. 
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I'm just trying to play 18 holes and see what happens.   Now I saw that I'm up there, and of course it's going to be a new situation for me, but then I watched a lot of Euro Cup the last two or three weekends, I've seen what happens after four or five minutes, and I'm happy to be on top at the moment.   But I would rather be on top on Sunday.

Q.   It's not the first time, is it, so presumably you can draw on some experience. 
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   I think it's the first time as a pro I am in the lead.   I can't remember.   Maybe I've been there before. 

Q.   Maybe halfway stage during the dayin Dubai? 
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   That might be true.   Halfway I know that Thomas BjÃ¶rn was leading in Dubai and I was pissed about that. 
I'm just enjoying so much this, I don't really think too much about it.   It's just a great feeling and a fantastic tournament.   I've always played here in Germany, and it was good to play good at the new venue.   I always know that I feel comfortable, and it feels good to play good at the new venue. 

Q.   Leading or not, you can certainly draw on the experience of being involved that many more times. 
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   That's why I'm practising so hard.   Of course it's good fun to be a Member of The European Tour, but then again, I want to become a winner.   I want to be like ThorbjÃ¸rn, and I'm trying desperately, especially when he's not here this week, I'm trying to sneak one in before he gets a chance to skip ahead of me like he has done the whole season.

Q.   There is a nice friendly rivalry between you two, you spur each other on. 
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   It's fun to have someone that you can practise with out there.   Of course, the days get so long, they get quite lonely if you don't bring your own coach or someone, and most of the guys have a professional relationship with our caddies.   Of course we are friends with our caddies, but when we leave from here, it's quite nice to have someone to just talk to and sit and go and maybe buy a new sweater if I so like; a real friendship.   He's the only guy that I would call outside of the golf course, which I think is quite enjoyable.   It is quite cool to have. 

Q.   We were looking at your golf bag, there's a Chelsea head cover in there.   Why? 
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   My uncle, he has been living in London for the last‑‑ since I was a kid.   He bought me a‑‑ what do you call that scarf, with Chelsea on it?   I started following it when I was 14 and I realised all of my friends are Man‑United fans and Liverpool fans, and I hate them for it (laughing). 
So I just thought it was fun to have something else in there, because no one at home is cheering on Chelsea.   So I thought, this is a good team, it has been for quite some time, and especially since the big Russian showed up.   I've been very happy this year of course for them. 

Q.   Do you ever get to see them play? 
JOEL SJÃHOLM:   Yeah, me and ThorbjÃ¸rn‑‑ ThorbjÃ¸rn again, we got tickets from our management group and we went to go and see Man‑United at home versus Chelsea, and of course they beat Chelsea.
