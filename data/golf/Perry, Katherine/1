 Q.  First off, how many years did you play on the PKBGT?  
KATHERINE PERRY: That's a great question. I think I started playing in 2007. Probably three years, three to four years.   
 Q.  Win anything?  
KATHERINE PERRY: I won maybe eight times. Yeah, it's a great tour. I mean, it's still the only of its kind where it's all girls. So I went from like playing in fields of five to ten girls to like 30 to 40, and now it's up to 90 sometimes for them.   
I think the model is great, too, because they don't do it by age. They do it by skill level. You can have a 17 year old still in the lower skill level. So I think it's a good model that way.   
 Q.  In addition to that, you went to school at UNC.  
KATHERINE PERRY: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  It's the Tarheel state. You're from North Carolina. You played on the PKBGT. There is just so much great golf here, and you continued your career to launch into this.  
KATHERINE PERRY: Yeah.   
 Q.  What's all that been like?  
KATHERINE PERRY: I think it's really helped -- like my support system is incredible. I had my coach from college, assistant coach, the current assistants coach, all came out today to watch practice. Having my coach be able to come every day was huge. He actually started the PKB Tour. Robert Linville.   
 Q.  Oh, yeah.  
KATHERINE PERRY: Yeah, so just being down here and being able to have my parents here and have that whole support system really makes you realize there is more outside of golf.   
 Q.  And then Pinehurst specifically, any fond memories of this place growing up?  
KATHERINE PERRY: Yeah, I played so many junior tournaments down here, so it's fun to come back and kind of remember those times and how much fun that was and how much I've grown since then.   
 Q.  And 18 holes left until that --  
KATHERINE PERRY: Yeah, finally. Gosh.   
 Q.  Yeah. When you've gone through all you have in your junior career and your amateur career and that birth of a full card on the LPGA is 18 holes away in a place you've been here a lot, what's that like just walking down fairway and collecting all that?  
KATHERINE PERRY: Yeah, I think tomorrow it'll hit my a little bit more. Hopefully playing well and getting that full card. Just knowing it kind of started here and now it's gone to this point, too, to be able to get the full card back.   
 Q.  You can do it. 18 more.  
KATHERINE PERRY: 18 more.
