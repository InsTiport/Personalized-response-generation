Q. A little unlucky there on 18, hit the flag, but nice way to cap off a good day?
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, I figure if you have a hundred shots and you hit them all at the flagstick, one of them is going to hit it.  It happens.  Overall it was really solid.  Hit it nicely like I have been all week.  Got a few putts to drop on the front nine after a rocky start and pretty pleased with where I'm at.
Q. How good did you play after that double?  You were hitting it close and making a lot of good putts?
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, I was burning edges.  Even the putt for bogey on that hole was a lip-out.  I figured it was a matter of time.  I was hitting good putts and they had to go in eventually, and they started to a little bit.
Q. A couple good saves, up-and-down on 17.  How proud are you the way you closed it out today?
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, I was kind of annoyed that it didn't go in.  I was trying to make that.  That was a pretty gettable shot but I had a good lie in the bunker, luckily.  But yeah, you know, it's a grind out there with all this wind and it has been for three days and look forward to the same tomorrow.
Q. Well, you seem to be in a good mood, excited for tomorrow?
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, wouldn't you be?  Why not.  I'm ready to go.  Game is feeling good, so we'll give it a shot.
Q. What would it mean to win the British Masters?
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, it would be great.  I would like to add to the -- it's got a great list of champions and it's a tournament that I've kind of always grown up watching it, all the different venues.  You know, it would be cool to add my name to that list.
