 Q.  Third consecutive round of 68, but it leaves you nicely in contention.  How do you feel about today's round?  
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, you know, I think I got off to a really nice start.  Made some putts and was 3-under through eight.  Kind of stalled a little bit, but I kept giving myself chances to hit some really nice shots and some nice iron shots, more importantly, which I've been working on earlier in the week.   
Just got to keep doing that.   
 Q.  Were you conscious of some of the low scores that were out there today, perhaps feeling that you had to sort of shoot well to stay in contention?  
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, but that's my mentality every day, regardless of what those guys do.  I'm just trying to birdie as many holes as I can.  So yeah, I saw Dylan shot 9-under and I think Lipsky shot 8-under and Rose is taking it deep and so is Rahm.   
Yeah, I knew they were out there, but they were out there for me, too.  It wasn't too big of an issue seeing those scores.   
 Q.  Just going into tomorrow, the final, DP World championship, you're going into it in contention.  That must be an exciting prospect for you on what's been a great year?  
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, I'm pumped.  It will be fun.  It's kind of exciting to test my game under the big stages, and you know, I feel like I can execute the shots under the gun and when it really matters.  So that's what I'm going to focus on tomorrow.   
 Q.  The experience this week playing in Dubai, great crowds getting behind you, has that been fun?  
JULIAN SURI: It's been a blast.  That's what I love.  Especially the kids, that's really cool, to hear them saying my name and everything, that's what it's all about.
