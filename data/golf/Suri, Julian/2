 Q.  Great start.  What are your thoughts finish everybodying the second round here?  
JULIAN SURI: It was a really solid round.  Still in position to contend for this thing.  I hit a lot of good shots, and obviously I had one kind of blemish on last hole today but for the most part I'm pretty pleased with where my game's at.   
 Q.  Great start on the front nine.  How important was that given the wind changes out there?  
JULIAN SURI: It was bound to happen.  The way I played for the last ten holes yesterday, it was kind of feeding into that.  I know my game is in a good spot and just kind of picking the spots and wanted to be aggressive and kind of fall back a little bit.   
 Q.  How is your mind-set at the moment, given you're back at right end of the leaderboard, only your third start this year?  
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, there's definitely a little bit of competitive rust slightly.  I still sometimes screw up marking the golf balls because I don't do that too often at home.  You know, all in all, I feel great.  It's great to be back in competition, something I missed for almost six months, and you know, I'm really relishing being out there again.   
 Q.  Away from the golf course, you must have missed it being on the golf course, but your thoughts on the Jags?  
JULIAN SURI: We have a rock solid defense as it is and we made some changes on the offensive side, so I like where we're at.
