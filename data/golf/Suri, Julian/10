 Q.  When you are the last guy coming in, what was your mindset coming into the event?  
JULIAN SURI: Well, you know, I think a lot of people were -- I like to think I play my best with a little chip on my shoulder.  A lot of people are saying congrats on being in the field.  I don't think in any other tournament they would say congrats on being in the field.  Obviously I was the last minute addition, I get that.   
I wanted to get off to a good start and I played really solid today.   
 Q.  Where do these types of comments inside the ropes come from?  
JULIAN SURI: Just past appearances.  I feel like I have it in me and I won a couple of times last year elsewhere, not on the PGA Tour.  I have played consistently and I feel like I deserve to be here.
