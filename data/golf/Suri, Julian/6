 Q.  Second round 66.  What was the key to the fantastic round today?  
JULIAN SURI: It was just really solid ball striking.  I got off to a nice start yesterday before the delay and made a couple birdies and just kind of kept the same vibe going.  I had one kind of costly 3-putt on No. 12 today, but just kind of stayed patient out there and was able to finish pretty strong with that eagle on 17.   
 Q.  Tell us about that approach shot, club, yardage?  
JULIAN SURI: I had 283 to the flag and I had a nice kind of -- the ball was a little bit below my feet and so it kind of suited for me to hit a bit of a cut shot in there, take a couple yards off it with the wind helping and came off perfect and as soon as I hit it I knew I had a good chance to be on the green at least and then I got lucky it landed on the upslope and ended up pretty close.   
 Q.  30 greens in regulation over these first two rounds.  What's been the key to that success?  
JULIAN SURI: Hitting it solid.  I don't know.  There's no -- yeah, there's no mistaking it, I've been hitting it solid for awhile now and just, yeah, I think that's the key out here is give yourself lots of chances and hopefully a few will drop.   
 Q.  You're a few shots off the lead going into the third round of a major, what's your mindset going into round three?  
JULIAN SURI: It's just more golf today.  I knew today was going to be a long day with all the holes I'm going to play and I kind of say it's more of an attitude thing and you just got to kind of grind it out with the heat and everything.  But it's just, as far as I'm concerned, just one long round, with a little bit of a lunch break in between, which is good, because I need it.
