 Q.  Julian, it's been a tough couple of days here with the weather conditions, but how pleased are you with a 2-under par?  
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, I've been playing solid for a long time.  I just needed a couple of putts to drop.  And I feel like the last couple of days I was much better inside of eight feet, which is kind of my -- last week definitely hurt me quite a bit.  But just to keep the momentum going when you're battling, when you're grinding, this is the type of golf I enjoy, and I kind of wish it was like this every week.   
 Q.  A lot of people are getting into trouble with the rough being up this week.  If you keep it on the fairway, though, it looks like there are scores out there to be had?  
JULIAN SURI: Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty much any course really.  I mean the pins are still challenging, and the wind is always a factor.  So it's just a good test from tee to green all around.   
 Q.  Roll ex-series event obviously going into the weekend in a nice position.  It must be an exciting prospect now with Saturday and Sunday coming up.  
JULIAN SURI: Yeah, it's a great opportunity to test my game.  It's been a little while since I've been in contention, but I feel like I've been through a lot and I've come out on the other side a stronger player, so I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  Well played today.  
JULIAN SURI: Thanks.  Appreciate it.
