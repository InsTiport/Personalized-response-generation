Q.   Obviously wasn't the day were you hoping for today, but do you take away what you did well the first three days? 
SHAWN STEFANI:   Yeah, I do.   It was definitely a grind out there today.   You know, didn't really feel like I played that bad, just couldn't get any momentum going.   I'm not saying I hit it my best this week, I didn't.   I didn't even putt my best, but, you know, it was still fun.   It was great to see Harris play well and I'm really happy for him and my hat is off to him.

Q.   What do you question most about what Harris went through for the day? 
SHAWN STEFANI:   You could see he was staying patient.   You could see he wasn't trying to do too much and he was just hitting it from Point A to Point B and just kind of picked the shots, you know, and out here you got to do that. 
Today the wind blew a little bit and kind of made it a little more difficult with the greens being firm.   He just put the balls in the right spots today, and that's what you got to do on a golf course like this.

Q.   Looking back, this was a fun event? 
SHAWN STEFANI:   Yeah, having the lead going into Sunday.   Like I told the media last night, it was going to be a new experience for me no matter if I won or finished the way I did today.   I will be much more prepared next time around. 
But, you know, I had fun.   Like I said, golf is a weird game and you can't have everything go your way all the time and I had a lot of stuff go my way this week, not just the last couple days but even this week.   You know, it's just a game.   It's just golf, and it will make me stronger in the end and can't wait to get in contention next time.
