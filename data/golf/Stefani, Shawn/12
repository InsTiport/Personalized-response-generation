Q. (Off microphone.)SHAWN STEFANI: I didn't know that, but definitely means I hit the ball well.  It was a solid day, you know.  It was nice to get off to a good start. Last week I got off to a rough start on Thursday but brought it back nicely. Just, you know, tried to get off to a better start this week, and I was happy with the way I played today.  After doubling 17 it was nice to kind of bounce back and make a par on 18.Q. You talk about your good start.  That was a 28-foot birdie putt on the opening hole.SHAWN STEFANI: Okay.  Well, I had Carl move his mark just a little bit to the right, and, you know, I really today was trying to focus on, you know, trying not to be too careful, and, you know, just line it up and hit it where I wanted to.  It went right in the center.  It is nice to get off to a good start when you birdie the first hole.Q. Carl Pettersson one of your fellow competitors you're referring to.  Talk about 17.  That was the only green you missed and the tee shot just got away from you.SHAWN STEFANI: Yeah, I think I was still a little jacked up from No. 16.  Kind of lost concentration a little bit, you know, made a bad swing, and, you know, really that was really the worst shot I hit on the hole. Took the drop and actually thought I hit a pretty good third shot after I hit the drop.  Obviously we all know the greens are firm, and it kind of kicked a little to the right and kept running up the hill and in that bunker.  And, you know, obviously I didn't get the ball up and down. So, I mean, you know, it's going to happen.  You're going to have bad holes.  You've just got to be able to rebound and forget about them and move on.
