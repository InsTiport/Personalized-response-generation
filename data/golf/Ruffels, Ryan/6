Q. Are you pleased with where you stand after stroke play?
RYAN RUFFELS: Yeah.  I mean, I'm in the match play, which is always nice.  I didn't play good today.  I kind of really struggled to get anything going.  Didn't make a birdie out there, which is a bit annoying, but really managed to keep myself in the tournament and not let it get away too quickly, which it can do out here, so I'm really proud of the way I fought it out today.
Q. Obviously match play is on the North Course and you played well there yesterday.  How does that course suit your game for match play?
RYAN RUFFELS: Yeah, I think it suits my game a little bit better.  I feel like I'm maybe one of the longer hitters, and that's a pretty demanding course off the tee in terms of length, so that's an advantage to me, and I've got some good vibes out there.  I haven't made a bogey on that course and made four birdies for a 66.  I've kind of got a good bit of momentum going there.  I'll do a bit of work maybe tomorrow morning with my coach and just kind of sort out a few things that went wrong today, and then we'll be ready for tomorrow.
Q. You're no stranger to match play.  How is that experience in the past going to help you here now?
RYAN RUFFELS: Yeah, it's big.  We play a lot of match play in Australia as well as I've played a lot of USGA events.  I mean, we probably have five or six match play events in Australia, so I'm used to that.  I know the mentality you've got to go in there with.  It's a little bit different around a course that's so hard like the North Course, so we're going to have to maybe try and get aggressive when we can, when we're in the fairway, and when there's time to kind of just hit to the center of the green, we've got to do that, too, so yeah.
