Q.   Talk about playing in this event.   I know you've been a regular here at Pebble Beach, about playing in this event today against the Giants?
HARRIS BARTON:   Look at the great fan support you get out here on a Tuesday afternoon.   You get the Giants on their day off to come down here and play in this.   This is great. 
It's all for charity.   That's why ‑‑ pro athletes sometimes get a bad name, and you know what?   Most of these guys are great guys and they're out here for charity.

Q.   How many times have you been involved in this now?
HARRIS BARTON:   Well, this event, I think, we have been doing four or five years.   It just gets bigger and bigger every year.   It's a lot of fun.

Q.   Who are you playing with?
HARRIS BARTON:   In this tournament?   I don't know who I'm with.   I think my teammate is Alex Smith.   So I think we're good.
