 Q.   How did your first round go?  
JONATHAN RANDOLPH:   It was definitely not a traditional round out here.   I missed a lot of fairways and just had a lot of long putts, which aren't that fun out here with these greens this speed.   It was a scramble.   
   
 Q.   Did the greens kind of start out slow and pick up as the day went on?  
JONATHAN RANDOLPH:   No, not really.   They were pretty quick from the word go.   I knocked my first putt about 10 feet past from probably 30 feet on No.10, so that was kind of a shocker, and then I got real defensive on my putts and just kind of got into a bad funk.   
To shoot under par after some of the places I was today, I'm happy with it knowing that I can easily improve on it.   
   
 Q.   Comparing the courses from last year to this year?   
JONATHAN RANDOLPH:   This one is definitely more penalizing if you don't hit it in the fairway.   Just the way the greens are shaped, the contours, it's just going to be more challenging to play from out of position.   
   
 Q.   You were paired up with your rival there.   
JONATHAN RANDOLPH:   Yeah, it's fun.   We have the same coach, and we're always pulling for each other, but to get to play with him, it's actually pretty nice because we're usually‑‑ you never know who you're playing with, so to play with another guy that you're comfortable with, it's nice.
