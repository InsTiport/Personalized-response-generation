  JONATHAN RANDOLPH: Played well in the Web.com event a few weeks ago.   Birdied 5 out of the last 6 coming in, five in a row.   That really kind of kick started it.   Proved that patience is a virtue thing works.     
I got some momentum there and played well and to take my -- the game I had and not play awesome and still finish in the Top 20 in that field is good for the momentum to come here and out of your own way and go play golf.
