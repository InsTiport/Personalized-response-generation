Q. 3-under today.  What was your strategy coming into today with the earlier tee time?
CLARISS GUCE: You know, just kind of -- I don't know.  Just kind of like see what I got and try to have some fun out there.  Just try to get as many opportunities as I can like yesterday.
Q. You put together two nice rounds.  How does this course play to your strengths?
CLARISS GUCE: I just like that it's very (indiscernible) off the tee, and I think I enjoy those types of courses.  Also having smaller greens, knowing that if you hit the green you're going to get a good look at the hole, that's definitely the type of course (indiscernible).
Q. For the first two rounds seems like the greens have been pretty receptive.  Have you been able to attack pins a little bit more?
CLARISS GUCE: Not really, because I kind of spent a lot of time in the rough today.  So I took advantage of the fact that the front is just kind of a bit firmer so I get to kick it up there a little bit.
So I just kind of, you know, just played to whatever I got, and just hopefully end up on the green and get a good look at it.
