Q. What did you think?  Not a bad place to finish today.
TRAVIS McINROE:   Yeah, today was a great round.  It helped hitting a lot of fairways and a lot of greens out here.  Just keeping the ball in position and not letting the wind control my ball, just trying to keep control of what's going on out there.
But just keeping your ball out of trouble really, just out of the pot bunkers, out of these silly lies you get in the rough and everything, and not letting the conditions get the best of you.
Q. Did you get a chance to play a couple rounds earlier in the week?
TRAVIS McINROE:   So I came in here on Thursday and walked both courses on Friday and then played the two practice rounds.  Walking the courses and seeing them twice was good to be more familiar with what's going on out there, and I played the par-3, as well, I think it was on Thursday or Friday -- Friday, so just getting used to how the wind is and everything.  I'm from Dallas, and play in Waco, Baylor, so I kind of know how wind is, but being here, right on the coast, it's a little bit different.  It's a little more heavy.  So it was good to get a lot of reps before the tournament rounds and see how the ball is affected by the conditions.
Q. Your thoughts going into tomorrow?
TRAVIS McINROE:   Kind of just do the same thing.  Trails is a really good golf course, too.  It's kind of different in that it's tree-lined instead of right on the coast.  Probably have to hit it a little bit straighter and just keep the ball in a good position like I was saying I did today, and if I do that, then I should give myself some more opportunities, and that's what we're looking for.
