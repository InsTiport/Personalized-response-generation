Q.   All in all really a solid day for you. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, I played really well today.   I couldn't get it going for a little while and was playing solid and then made a long putt on 17 and just kind of opened the door.   Just kept plugging and got on a good roll there and made five in a row.   Disappointing on the last, but played well. 

Q.   I thought you drove it really well.   I thought your iron play was superb.   You can draw a lot of positives from today. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, for sure.   I drove it pretty long today, and I drove it straight at times.   Hit some good iron shots.   Didn't end up as good as I thought they were, but all in all, I played really well and I did a lot of good things.

Q.   Would you take three more 66s?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   It depends.   You know, you never know at this tournament if it gets soft, guys can just light it up out here.   But right now I might take them. 

Q.   Can you talk about your round today?   A nice start to the week. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, it was a nice start.   Played well early and couldn't get one to go, and then made a long putt on 17 and just kind of got the momentum going in the right direction.   I reeled off five in a row, which was real nice. 
But I played well.   I drove it good, hit my irons good, and putted pretty well. 

Q.   What's the course like out there?   Looks like it's going to be a low score that's going to win this thing. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, I mean, it's‑‑ the rough isn't that easy, so from the fairway if you drive it well you can hit some short clubs into greens, and the greens are perfect.   We were first off this morning, so we were playing on fresh greens. 
But the course is in great shape.   Just going to depend on the weather, really.

Q.   Is it one of those courses that suits your eye, so to speak?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, I've always liked it.   I've always played well here.   It's just one of those courses that you just like and you feel comfortable on, and that's a big part of it.

Q.   With a course like that, isn't it one day at a time, one round at a time, you can't get too caught up in chasing numbers and all that kind of stuff?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, for sure.   You hear the clichÃ© all the time, one shot at a time, but it definitely holds true out here.   When guys are shooting low numbers you can't try to force anything.   You've just got to keep doing what you're doing and not pay attention to everything going on around you.

Q.   Do you remember a streak that you birdied five in a row like that? 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   It's been a while.   I can't recall the last one because I haven't made too many birdies this year.   But I've done it a few times, but I can't remember the last time, no. 

Q.   They say there's certain roars for certain guys.   Can you tell when like Zach or Steve do something out here?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, for sure.   I think one of them was a couple groups behind me.   You can see the amount of people that are out and the kind of deep roar you hear.   It's not like you would hear it for me or other guys.   You can definitely tell it's a favorite. 

Q.   Just talk about the putt there on 9 to finish, obviously not the way you wanted to finish. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, I had in my head that that putt was going to be really slow, and I read it and I went behind the hole and it looked a little quicker.   I watched Charlie [Wie]'s chip roll out, and I got a little tentative with it, really.   That's about it.

Q.   Just your overall feeling on the round today?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   It was good.   I played well, and I'm pleased with my round.   I'll take the positive and try to forget about that one on the last and look forward to tomorrow.
