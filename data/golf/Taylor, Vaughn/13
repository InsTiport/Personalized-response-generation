Q. I bet if you play 27 and go play the front-9 again, you would rather do that with 5 birdies on the back.
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Thanks.  I played well on the back-9 and holed some putts and got a couple good breaks, hit some good shots and had some momentum going.
Q. Correct me if I'm wrong, I feel like this is a golf course that probably suits your eye really well.  You step up on the tees, probably looks like a golf course you can take advantage of.
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah, it does.  I played well here in the past and you have some good memories, and it's definitely a course I like and it fits my eye for sure.
Q. How did you navigate the adjusting conditions really not being able to see the property yesterday with all the rain that happened?  You found the birdies late in your round.  How was the adjustment to getting this golf course a little bit damper?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: You kind of did it on the fly, really.  Played 1 and see how soft and firm it is.  Play your way through it and figure out how the ball is bouncing, what it's doing, and things like that.  The fairways weren't rolling at all, so that was pretty easy to figure out.  The ball is pretty much backing up on every tee shot.  The greens, you know, you kind of figured them out.  They were bouncing a little bit, still not as soft as I thought they would be.
Q. Something you're most excited about today you want to carry over tomorrow?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Just momentum.  Just one of those things when you get it, you want to keep it, so it's hard to find it sometimes.  So hopefully tomorrow I can just keep it rolling and keep swinging well and putting well.
Q. Great start.
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Thank you very much.
