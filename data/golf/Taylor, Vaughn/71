Q.
Nice round.  Obviously good scoring conditions today with the greens soft.  Just tell us about the round.
VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I played pretty solid today.  I putted pretty well.  I hit it good and just, you know, made a bogey coming in and    but, yeah, it's out there.  The greens are as soft as they can be.  Almost too soft sometimes, they pin the ball too much.  But it's playing long, but the greens are definitely soft and it's making it easier.
Q.  You got off to a fast start today and you were able to maintain.  Were you surprised that you were able to maintain it despite the delay?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I think this year we're getting used to it.  I don't even think about it anymore, I just tee it up and play.
Q.  Were you surprised how fast you were able to get off today?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Not really.  I haven't been playing good lately, so I think I was due a little bit to have a good round.  It's about time.
Q.  How much does The Masters play into your mind?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I'm trying not to think about it at all.  I was thinking about it up until now and I'm just trying to play and be blank almost, not think about anything.
Q.  You say you're kind of due.  Is there anything different, though, are you feeling better about the way your swing is coming around and the way your game is?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:  You know, I felt pretty good all year.  I felt like I haven't been far off, just things haven't been going my way and I haven't been scoring.  I still feel pretty good and hopefully it will get a little better.
