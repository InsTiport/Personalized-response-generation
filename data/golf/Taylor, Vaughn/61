   VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Missed a few greens in some bad spots, got a couple up-and-downs, missed a couple up-and-downs and played pretty good.   
  
  Q.  You played with Brett Quigley and Charles Howell III.  You guys traded licks there early on a lot?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Yeah, it was a good group.  We all got off to a decent start.   
 Brett played really solid all day long.  It's fun when you've got a good group and nice guys to play with.   
  
  Q.  As this course continues to dry out and become firmer, the greens getting a little bit firmer, what's the key to going low on Sunday?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  You just make putts.  There's not much rough out there and the ball is running out so you get some short irons into some holes.  You've got to make some birdies and roll some putts in.   
  
  Q.  Tell me what it's like to go through the famous 16th hole.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  It was pretty crazy today, really loud.  Just a lot of energy in the air.  There's not another hole like it I don't think.  It's exciting.
