   STEWART MOORE:  Like to welcome Vaughn Taylor to the media room here at the Northern Trust Open after a fantastic opening round 67.  The winds picked up a little bit as the day progressed, did you see that coming down the stretch?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Yeah, I did, it actually kind of completely turned around on us.  You know, it actually made the last few holes easier, so kind of caught a break there.   
 STEWART MOORE:  Your year so far, Top-10 at the Bob Hope, played well, and you haven't played as well as you might have liked the last few events.  What seems to be clicking thus far that wasn't the last few weeks?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Just scoring really.  I haven't played bad the last few weeks, just kind of haven't gotten it in the hole.  Today I just got it done.  I chipped in once and made a long putt, and, you know, feel fortunate to shoot what I shot.   
 STEWART MOORE:  Coming in we were talking about Forest Hills back in Augusta, a classic design that had been there for a while.  Do you like these courses like Riviera, kind of a throwback?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I really do.  It's nice to play these old, classic golf courses.  Just visually, they are beautiful and they just have a really good feel to them.  They are a lot of fun to play.   
  
  Q.  What kind of change did you notice this year from last year?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Firmness, I would say.  It seems to be pretty firm.   
  
  Q.  I mean about the tournament in general.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Tournament in general?   
  
  Q.  New sponsor, is that something only the fans notice.  Media notices, do players notice anything different?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I wouldn't say so.  There's not any Nissans on the par 3 for Rich Beem to jump up on.  (Laughter).   
 Other than that, I didn't really notice much.   
  
  Q.  That's okay.  Just curious.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Sorry.   
  
  Q.  You get a new bank account if you make a hole-in-one on 14 this year.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Exactly.   
 STEWART MOORE:  In addition, Northern Trust has added $1 million to the purse and the Pro-Am format with the reduction of amateurs, and a lot of guys are fans of that.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Four amateurs are perfect.  I didn't play yesterday, but three amateurs is perfect.   
  
  Q.  Have you done well here before?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I have not.  I don't even know -- I don't think I've even made the cut here.   
  
  Q.  Never mind.  We'll follow up on that later.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  It's a new year.   
  
  Q.  What are you expecting out of yourself this year?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I'd like to win a couple times.  You know, last year, I played well at the beginning of the year and then kind of struggled the second half.   
 But I feel like my game's there, and I'd like to get back in the winner's circle.  It's been a while.  I'd also like to win a bigger tournament.  Kind of catch some heat for winning Reno, it's an opposite event.   
 So, you know, like to play well at Augusta.  I don't want to put too many expectations on myself, but I'd like to win there.  You know, we'll see what happens though.   
  
  Q.  Are you in there already?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Through?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Last year's finish.   
  
  Q.  Top 16?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  And I'd be curious on the 18th and 9th, your club section on both, and how different that has been in previous times you've played here.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Today I hit 3-iron on 18.  It was playing into the wind when we went through.  It turned around downwind, so it would be a little bit different now.  And 9, I hit 5-iron in.   
  
  Q.  That's about typical for 9, isn't it?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I saw guys driving it short of the left bunker on 9 this morning.  We got past it, so I can imagine this morning guys were hitting two, 3-irons in, I would imagine.   
  
  Q.  Chad hit a 3-wood.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Really?  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Can we get your card real quick, curious on the chip and the long one you made.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Chipped in on 18.   
  
  Q.  From what side of the green?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Left side, short left.   
 Long putt was on 15.  I made it from the front fringe.  Probably 40 feet maybe.   
 I birdied 17 and 18, then No. 8 and 6.   
  
  Q.  What did you do on 8?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I hit driver, pitching wedge, made a 20-footer.   
  
  Q.  Right of the hole?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  A little long and right, yeah.   
  
  Q.  Did you find your pitchmark?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Yeah, it does get firm back there on that green.  That's why I hit driver to get it down there to have a shorter club in to be able to hold the green there.   
  
  Q.  Were there some greens that were holding better than, for example, 8?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  They were pretty consistent.  There were a few that were a little softer.  But you know, might have just -- you know, depends on where you pitch it.  If you land it in the low spot, it's a little softer.  The knobs in the higher parts of the green are firmer obviously.    
 STEWART MOORE:  Vaughn, good luck this week.
