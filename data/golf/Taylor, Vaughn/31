  Q. The greens are rolling absolutely perfect.  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: You got to adjust to the speed and, you know, I grew up on slow greens, felt pretty comfortable on it.  
  
  Q. So the Ninja is putting with a Ghost. When that did that switch happen?  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Put it in in Houston. Wasn't feeling comfortable over it, decided to change and I like it.  
  
  Q. I think you should now, 4-under par 68. That's a great way to get it started. Keep it going.  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: I'll try not to. Thank you.  
  
  Q. Couple general comments about the round, obviously a great way to start the week.  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah. Made a lot of birdies and hit some good shots and made a couple mistakes, 3-putt and made some bogies with wedges but all in all a good round. Just trying to get back in the groove.
