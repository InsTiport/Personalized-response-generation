   VAUGHN TAYLOR: I like the course, and hopefully I can keep it going this week.  
  
  Q. Even with the changes here, you've been able to still do a good job.  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah. Sometimes the course will fit your eye. It's just one of those courses, you know. 3-woods off the tees and, you know, wedge game is usually stronger part of my game. You know, just position golf course, and it fits my game.   
 I played pretty good. I made some good putts. Hit a few squirrely shots that kind of cost me some bogies. Not as easy as I wanted to make it. Kind of a -- didn't feel like I was 5-under at one -- I was 5-under one time, and I felt like it was around even par. One of those days. Made a couple good 25, 30 footers. Played solid.   
 It's always the drive out here. If you miss a fairway, like I missed it left, and you're chipping out and hit a 6-iron into the green. You just can't advance it over the creek or get behind the trees. You've got nothing. You just got to hit the fairway.
