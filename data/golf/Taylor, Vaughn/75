Q.
You said you learned a lot.  What did you learn?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Just learned how to handle the pressure a little bit.  Hopefully next time I'll be a little better.
Q.
Talk about the nerves.  Today was it maybe a combination of some nerves plus the conditions?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Yeah, I mean, I played tough.  The wind was tricky and I was a little nervous, too, so it all factored in, but that's how it goes sometimes.

Q.
Was it more you were trying to chase David than it was trying to fight for second place?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I wasn't thinking about David too much.  Getting off to a really good start, I knew I wasn't going to be able to catch him, so it was more for second place.
Q.  That 8-under is still good enough for Top 10, is it not, you can still play next week?

VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I don't think I can get in Memorial.  I don't think it gets me into Buick, but I think I was already in anyway.

I was looking to finish a little stronger, but, you know, maybe next year.
