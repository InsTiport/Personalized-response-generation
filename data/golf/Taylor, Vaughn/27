Q.   4‑under par 66 today, a bit of an up‑and‑down round. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yesterday was a little more so.   Today was a little more consistent.   Played well.   Played good out there.   Hit a got of good shots. 

Q.   You Monday qualified for this; how is your game? 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   It's good.   I started playing good last week and played good Monday.   Just kind of going with the flow and keep it going. 

Q.   What seemed to be working last week that carried over to this week?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Just a little bit of everything.   But starting to hit it better.   I went back to a short putter last week, as well.   Started to putt better.   So putted really good on Sunday, and hit some good putts. 
I made some good putts.   Missed a couple. 

Q.   Just talk about the conditions this morning compared to yesterday afternoon?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Much different.   Wind didn't blow until the seventh or eighth hole maybe.   Yesterday we played every hole with the wind blowing.

Q.   Any birdies today that really stand out on the card? 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   The last hole was pretty good.   I finished with a birdie there, 12 feet maybe. 
Nothing crazy.   I hit 18 in two, a nice, easy birdie there. 

Q.   Talk about this weekend, tough golf course, you're right there in contention.   Just your thoughts. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, the course is playing hard.   So I'm sure this weekend, it's going to continue.   You know, it's one of those courses you've got to be patient.   You're going to make some bogeys and you've just got to keep trekking and don't let it bother you, and you know, if you do that, I think you can stay in the hunt.
