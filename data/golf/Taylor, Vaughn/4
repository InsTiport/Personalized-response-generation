Q. Vaughn, when did you become aware of the news about Nick Watney testing positive, and what was your reaction?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: I got the news at the turn. Clay came up to us and felt like we should know. So I was a little shocked, to be honest. Heart started racing, got a little nervous. Just hope Nick's doing well and we get through this.
Q. Do you have any plans to be retested?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yes. I'm going to get tested now.
Q. Did you think about this during the round at all?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Oh, yeah, it was on our minds that second nine. We were all chitchatting about it. It's hard not to think about it.
Q. How are you feeling right now?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: A little nervous, but I feel good. I didn't have any close contact with Nick yesterday. We kept our space. We didn't shake hands. Right after the round, I washed my hands. Nick never coughed or sneezed. So I feel comfortable.
Q. And you getting tested now is part of the protocol, the contact tracing, that's just part of the program, I'm guessing?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Correct. Our entire group is getting tested.
Q. Is your caddie also getting tested?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yes.
Q. And do you feel any symptoms at all?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: No.
