 Q. Great round. It's been a while since you've had a great round. Nice job. 
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Thanks. It was nice to get out there and play well. It's been a while, and I've been struggling a little bit. But I feel like my game is good, and I played well today.

 Q. What have you found over the last few weeks that finally came together for you today? 
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Nothing in particular, just kind of been working on some things, and I think they're finally paying off a little bit. I made a little adjustment in my putting, and I think that helped. But I've been swinging well, and I feel like I'm hitting it well.

 Q. How do you feel your confidence up when things are not going well? You've been close to making a lot of cuts lately, but how do you keep your confidence up?
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: You've just got to believe it's right there. Golf is a crazy game. You can be playing well and not scoring well. That's kind of my case; I felt like I was playing pretty well. My confidence was still there. You've just got to believe.

 Q. Is it right there?
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: I think so. I'm playing well, and it seems to be happening. 

 Q. You've played well here in the past, as well. Take care, and have good week. 
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Thanks.
