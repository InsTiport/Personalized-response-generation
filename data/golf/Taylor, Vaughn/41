  Q. Vaughn, what was it like playing out there?  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: I don't really have a choice. I've got to try to keep a card. Rain, thunderstorm or anything, I've got to play.  
  
  Q. You played well today, 16 greens. Sounds like you just managed the course really well.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah, I played solid. I didn't miss a fairway and just kind of kept it in front of me and birdied some par-5s and got it done.  
  
  Q. That's really the smart way to play this golf course, particularly in conditions like this, birdie the par-5s and you can steal a couple more, and you've had a good day.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah, I agree. I just tried to play smart. We've got so much clothing on, so I was actually just aiming for the middle of the green and made a couple good putts, a couple good 30-footers and birdied a couple par-5s.  
  
  Q. Now, is there a cold weather story with you guys, you and Charlie Warren and Fredrik playing around today? Did Fredrik have some stories from Sweden, how cold it was when he used to play or anything?  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: We really didn't talk about it a whole lot. I think we all knew it was cold, and we were trying not to think about it. I had my hands on my hand warmers and just kind of trying to -- I was actually just watching the geese fly by and hoping they were going south.  
  
  Q. But they weren't, they kept going the other way.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: I agree. We were like, they're going the wrong way.
