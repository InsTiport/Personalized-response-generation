Q. Very few mistakes, if any, for Vaughn Taylor.  If you summarized this round, what would you describe it as?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: A little rust early and then kind of settled in and hit some good shots and made some good putts.  But overall, I was a little rusty early.  I had some squirrely shots coming out.  But, you know, I kind of settled in and got a feel for it and got kind of a little bit of groove.
Q. You mentioned rust twice in that answer there.  Are you disappointed with how you performed?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: No, not at all.  I'm pleased.  I played well.  Just things are different when you're at home practicing and then come out in the tournament.  It was a good learning curve today.  I'm really pleased.
Q. Finally, can you talk about this golf course.  Very little wind.  Is it yielding a lot of birdies out there?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: I'd say so.  It's in great shape.  The greens are really good.  If you drive it in the fairway, you can hit some short clubs into some greens.  Par 5s are reachable.  Without the wind, you definitely can make some birdies out there.
Q. Is this your best first round out here?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: I think so, yeah.  Absolutely.
Q. You've had a couple of good rounds out here, but they've been like later on in the tournament, right?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah, I think so.  I haven't played my best here.  I feel like I'm trending in the right direction to be able to play in the wind and play here.
Q. With the conditions today, were you encouraged when you first came out here?
VAUGHN TAYLOR: You know, it is what it is, I guess.  I didn't really look at the forecast.  It was blowing a little bit early, and then it kind of settled down.  It's hard to say.  Just kind of -- you never know what's going to happen out here.  You know the wind's going to blow at some point or at least a little bit.  So that's kind of how I view it.
