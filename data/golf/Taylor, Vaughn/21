  Q.   Kind of an up‑and‑down day, I guess.   Anything you can put your finger on today?  
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   I didn't hit it very good today.   The course played tough.   You really had to strike the ball good and be in the right spots and I didn't do much of that.   
   
 Q.   You kind of turned it around.   You started with a double and then kind of turned it around a little bit.   
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, I didn't start well.   I told myself to hang in there.   It was a long day, and I just kept plugging away at it.   It was unfortunate, I hit it in the bunker on 14 or 15, whatever hole that is.   I just didn't hit very quality shots coming in.   
Hit a good drive on 18, and then just went through the fairway.   That kind of put me behind that tree.   I made a bad decision to try to putt that one from the fringe.   
   
 Q.   All that aside, do you feel like maybe that's just good that you did have to grind something out, you can build on that for tomorrow?   
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, for sure.   I'm one back, I guess, and it's playing tough.   So, go out tomorrow and shoot a couple under and who knows what happens.   
I'm right there, I just got to keep working at it.   We got 18 more to go.  
   
 Q.   What are you working on now?   
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   I'm just trying to stay in my posture and trying to get a little cue to take it back.   Other than that, same old stuff.  
   
 Q.   It is kind of the same old stuff, isn't it?   Everybody has their key.   
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Exactly.   
   
 Q.   Or their fault or whatever it is?  
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah.   Exactly.   We all have two to three tendencies and tend to work on those most of the time.
