  Q. Bogey-free 64s are nice.   Get some comment the on your day?
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:   It was an interesting day.  I was lucky to not make a bogey today.  I hit a couple squirrelly shots but hit some good shots as well and putted nicely.  All in all, first round of the year, I'll take it.
 Q. Take me through the eagle on No. 9.
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah, hit a good drive.  Just squeaked it inside that left bunker and I caught the rake and had a funky lie.  I was in the bunker, ball above my feet, and just choked way up on a 7-wood and hit a great shot to 15, 20 feet and hit a good putt, dead center.  It was nice.
 Q. Conditions out there today?
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:   You know, it's fairly benign.  I mean, the wind's not blowing too hard which usually is the defense, but you know, there's some good pins, some easy pins, and a good mix of holes.  So all in all, course is in great shape.  Looking forward to the weekend.
