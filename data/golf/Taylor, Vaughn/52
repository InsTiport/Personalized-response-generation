  Q.  Vaughn, a really good start in the first round.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Thank you.  It was a good day.  I played well, and it was good to get off to a good start.   
  
  Q.  What did you come in here with this week?  What were you doing good?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I've been putting well, ball-striking has been okay, and kind of okay with everything, I guess.  But I've been putting pretty good.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the TPC Louisiana and how it played today.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  It played great today.  It's in fabulous shape.  I've never seen it better.  It played tough.  It was firm and fast and the wind is blowing, and it was a good test.
