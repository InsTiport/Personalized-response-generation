Q.   Vaughn, first of all, take us through hole 15, great shot there. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah.   I've absolutely destroyed that hole over the past few years, and just really tough, short hole.   I mean you gotta have a perfect shot. 
And you know, I decided, you know, driver would have got it back there, but I decided to go with the 3‑wood, try to take the water out of play.   Just take whatever chip shot I had, and just had a good luck, perfect little bump‑and‑run pitching wedge. 
And my last look, I saw it going in in my head and just kind of shut the brain off and chipped it and it was just perfect, went in.

Q.   A little by of a tough stretch for you here over the last month or so, but to finish 65, 65, that's got to give you a lot of confidence. 
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   Yeah.   Definitely.   I've been struggling lately.   Not playing bad, but missed a couple cuts by one shot.   Didn't play very good in Memphis. 
But yeah, things came together this week, and really started to hit the ball well.   Been putting good.   Just haven't been hitting it consistently, and you know, just too many way ward shots.   You know, still hit a few this week, but overall, I hit it really well.

Q.   What's your schedule over the next few weeks?
VAUGHN TAYLOR:   I'm out by two next week, so hopefully I can get in, and then I'm going to play the next couple.   So I think it's Greenbriar, John Deere.   And I think I'm going to skip Canada.
