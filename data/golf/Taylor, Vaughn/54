 Q.  Talking about today. 

 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Today was a struggle.  Didn't putt good at all.  Didn't feel comfortable.  I learned a lot.  You always want to get off to a good start and make some putts. 

 Q.  Emotionally. 

 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  It was pretty special out there.  A lot of friends and family are here.  All in all it was a good week. 

 I learned a lot this week.  I had a lot of pressure out there today.  Hopefully I'll get better because of it. 

 Q.  On Zach and Vaughn. 

 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  We have been supportive.  I told him to finish strong.  He played really sound under some key putts.  That's Zach.  That's what he did at the Ryder Cup.  He's a tough guy. 

 Q.  In reference to the Hooter's Tour. 

 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Somewhere along the way he got it into another gear.  Where he's improved is his putting.  His attitude is one of the best out there.  His aura, outlook on life. 

 Tiger has an amazing record in Majors.  It's nice to see him give one up. 

 "If he's not Superman, who is he?  Superman's brother, maybe." 

 Q.  Reference to Zach. 

 VAUGHN TAYLOR:  Is a big time grinder.  At Ryder Cup he showed a lot of guts.  He did today too.  He does a lot of the right things.
