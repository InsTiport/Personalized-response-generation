  Q. Why don't we just start with the playoff, Vaughn, teeing off on 18. You hit a hybrid from there?  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah. I hit the 3-iron. It was kind of just a bad yardage. 5-wood is going to reach the bunker, and I just wanted to take the bunker out of play. It was a three-shot hole for me. And I didn't have the best tee shot.   
  
  Q. It was a little left.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah. I kind of left myself with a long ways in. And just pulled a 3-wood, and fortunately we're playing ball in hand, so you can get a good lie in the rough. Hit a really good wedge shot. And Matt obviously had a great putt there.   
  
  Q. Right. How far was your wedge?  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: I had 127.   
  
  Q. It covered the flag the whole way.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah. It was right around --  
  
  Q. From here it almost went in.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Did you see that from the fairway?  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah. It looked like it had just the right amount of spin on it. You know, it was coming out of the rough. It was just a really good number for me to control the spin.   
  
  Q. Okay. And then on 12, you both got into a little bit of trouble. Talk about that hole.   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah. Just a bad swing off the tee and had a tough second shot, and you know, just one of those things.   
 And I hit a good wedge in there and had a good look at it. Probably had a chance to make that one. Kind of just snuck a little left on me.  
  
  Q. Were there some nerves coming out? You had about a 45-minute wait going out. Is it worse to have time to think about it or just keep playing like Matt got to?  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Yeah. It's probably better to keep playing.   
 But I felt good. I was obviously nervous, but under control, so I feel good out there.   
  
  Q. And Slugger's decision, he came on up to you and just said -- did he give you a choice or did he say --  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: No. He said, I think that's enough. And you know, I agree. You don't want to have a putt on the next hole and it being too dark.
