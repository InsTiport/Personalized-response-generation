Q.  Can you talk about your day today, Woody, a great start to the year?

WOODY AUSTIN:  Yeah, I mean I basically got away with the fact that the golf course was pretty wide open.  I hit it all over the place.  Just very lucky.  I only made one par in the last seven holes, so that's pretty interesting to only make one par on your last 11 holes.
Q.  It was birdies, bogeys, doubles, birdies?

WOODY AUSTIN:  The front nine, I got away with some bad swings and on the back nine I didn't get away with them, so it's just one of those things about the golf gods or whatever you want to talk about, you keep testing them and they are going to get you eventually and they certainly got me.  But fortunately I was able to hit a couple of good ones and make some birdies.

Q.  Vaughn, 4-under, not a bad start for your first time on this golf course and at this event?

VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I'm pleased with the way I played today.  Got the putter going on the front and struggled on the back but I got a couple coming in.
Q.  What's your take on the golf course?

VAUGHN TAYLOR:  It's tough, you know.  The fairways are wide and the greens are big, but you can get a lot of funny lies.  I don't think I had a flat lie today.  Lots of big, breaking putts.  It's not easy.
Q.  Were you coming into this week thinking, "I can win this thing"?

VAUGHN TAYLOR:  I think so.  I feel good about my game.  Just try and shake out the rust a little bit, hopefully I did that today.
