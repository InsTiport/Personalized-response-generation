  Q. Who did you play your practice rounds with?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Played with Larry Mize and Johnson and then yesterday I played with David Toms.   
  
  Q. So guys you are pretty familiar with. Did you play on mini-tours together?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Nick is a little younger for me but I met him a couple years ago on TOUR. He's a good guy and we just hit it off, good friends.   
  
  Q. What is it like playing the Par 3 Contest behind the big three?  
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: It was awesome, it was fun. You don't get to see those three together many times anymore. It was pretty special. Everybody loves them and it was pretty cool to be right behind them.   
  
  Q. Nicklaus came in today and I think everybody wants him to be an Honorary Starter; would you like to see him fulfill that role?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: I think one day. I don't know if he's quite ready yet but I'm sure he will. He's what the Masters is about. He's won six times.   
  
  Q. Of those three guys, was there one in particular that you followed closely?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Well, more Nicklaus. I think he was more, you know, my era. But you know, I always knew he watched Palmer and Gary Player in the Masters. But Nicklaus is more -- he was still playing when I was growing up.   
  
  Q. Did you follow any one of them during the Masters growing up?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: I would come and check them all out really. No particular one, but I would look at all three.   
  
  Q. In general how are you feeling this week after your practice rounds?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: I feel good and I'm ready to get started. I had an early exit last week, and you know, I've been home for a few days. Ready to go. I feel good. Just looking forward to getting started.   
  
  Q. Is playing the Par 3 more relaxing and having fun or preparing?   
 VAUGHN TAYLOR: Mostly relaxing and having fun. At the same time it's good practice, good wedge practice.
