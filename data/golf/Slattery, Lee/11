Q. Three birdies to finish, a round of 66.  You must be delighted?
LEE SLATTERY: Absolutely.  I played the course yesterday and it was difficult.  It was playing really long.
I think the difference today was the sun came out, played a little bit shorter.  3-irons turned into 6-irons, I think that was the difference, just gave me a bit more confidence.  I always feel like the strength of my game is my mid-irons, so it helped me a lot.
Q. You still must have to pinch yourself the way things turned around.  We saw you here, you are joint lead at the moment.  Early stages, I know, but it's just a complete turnaround?
LEE SLATTERY: I think it is.  It's been pure hard work.  Not where it's massively hard the past couple of years, but with things off the golf course.  I think this year things have settled down massively.  I have been able to work really, really hard.  A lot of great things happening at home as well.  I think that's just been the difference, just hard work.  Little kids trying to play the game, that's been the difference.
Q. Since that win in Russia, do you play with a bit more freedom now, now that you know the future is fairly secure certainly for next year?  Does that change the mindset in any way?
LEE SLATTERY: I think it has.  It certainly relaxes you.  Your goals change now.  You start to think about how high can I finish in the Race to Dubai.  You have got these bigger events at the end of the year, as well.
