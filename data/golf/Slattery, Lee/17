Q.   Unlucky on the first, what happened? 
LEE SLATTERY:   Pulled it off the tee.   It was going to be all right.   It was a long way to where the ball was from the cart path, just bounced.   My provisional wasn't the best. 
Didn't have a great lie, went for it, straight in the water short.   And then apart from that, I wouldn't say I played fantastically well, but I didn't hit many bad shots.   Hit a lot of fairways. 
You needed a few good breaks today on some of the holes.   If the weather is good tomorrow, go out and shoot 8â€‘under, you never know, do you.   I saw somebody shot 90, as well.   Can be done.   If you are off your game out there today, you can shoot a high number.
