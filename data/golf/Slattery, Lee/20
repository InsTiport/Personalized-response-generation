  Q.  Nice birdie at the end for a share of the lead?   
 LEE SLATTERY:  Share with Zane Scotland, a good friend of mine and we have played a lot of golf together. He has played fantastic this year. Two European Tour starts and he had a top ten in the French Open and now this. It should be a good game and I am looking forward to it.   
  
  Q.  Tough conditions?   
 LEE SLATTERY:  It was like four seasons in one day out there and that messes with your concentration levels.  I had to work very hard out there but an early night tonight, have a good meal and refuel.   
  
  Q.  Why did the third, your 12th take so long?   
 LEE SLATTERY:  I had a bit of a nightmare there. I have made one bogey in two days. I had hit my second on the walkway and it was soaking but the only place I could drop was in the rough which didn't seem fair after a good lay up. Got a flier out of the rough over the green and made six which rattled me a little bit and then bogeyed the next but holed a 40 footer on the par three and that got me back on track. I was okay then.  It was frustrating but one of those things.  But finished well. Nice 8 iron to three feet and the aim over the last few holes was to play with Zane Scotland so that is great.   
 We are managed by the same person as well and have had a few games. I have played with him a couple of times this year and he is playing great. I thought how can he not be doing well on europro tour and he gets his first European Tour start and he is in contention. Shows what sort of player he is. He has had a tough time with injuries and hopefully he is back now.
