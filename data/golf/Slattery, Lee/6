Q. Lee, that's a fantastic start for you.  It's been a tough start to the season but that's your lowest opening round in a tournament so far.  You must be pleased?
LEE SLATTERY: Yeah, really, really pleased.  Last week was nothing to go on I suppose.  I have no form around Wentworth, so it was no surprise, that struggle around there.  Just didn't feel like I quite had it last week.
But freed things up a little bit this week, and yeah, I've just gone out there a little bit harder and I've just been playing a lot better, today, in particular, obviously.
Q. Two very different nines, quite hilly on the back nine but you've managed to get around without dropping a shot?
LEE SLATTERY: Yeah, I didn't even notice.  It was one shot at a time, obviously.  I didn't know that.  That's great.  I played a Pro-Am on Monday and didn't drop a shot in that.  There's obviously a bit more form there now.  It's just nice to go out there and shoot a low score, because like you say, it's something I haven't done yet this year and I've been waiting for it..
Q. You've got two birdies in your opening three holes, you can kind of build from that sort of positive start.
LEE SLATTERY: I think you do.  I think that's something else I haven't done this year.  I haven't started well in tournaments.
Again, last week at Wentworth, 3-over after four is not a great start and then your back's up against the wall and you start pushing for birdies, as opposed to letting them happen.  When I got to 3-under, it was a nice feeling and thought I've got some good chances here.  It was nice.
