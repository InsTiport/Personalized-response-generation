Q.  To bogey the first to get yourself right back in the thick of the action must be good?
LEE SLATTERY:  Birdieing 3 after bogey 1 is always good.  Played steady over the first, the front nine, and made some great putts coming down the stretch.  All in all, yeah, I'm happy.
Q.  At 5 under, you can see you're in illustrious company there with some of these guys.
LEE SLATTERY:  Yeah, absolutely, a few good names up there.  It would have been nice to finish 7 and be up there with the leaders.
Q.  Have did you enjoy the experience of playing with Ernie in practice the other day?
LEE SLATTERY:  He was very good.  He played great believe it or not in, the six holes I played.  Got to get a bit better, just found my game and gave me new confidence, really, and that's what's been happening.
Q.  The week in general; you're enjoying doing the world documentary, aren't you?
LEE SLATTERY:  Yeah, I did enjoy that.  It wasn't too sort of time demanding, you know, throughout the day.  Just little snippets here and there.  Looking forward to seeing it.
Q.  We'll see what tomorrow brings.  You're going to be among the leaders.  What do you have to do?
LEE SLATTERY:  Yeah, there will be good atmosphere out there tomorrow and it should be good.

I'll really enjoy it.
