Q. Into the quarterfinals.  Tell me a little bit about how you're feeling right now.
PRESTON SUMMERHAYS: I'm feeling good.  The putter wasn't -- I would say wasn't as good the second 18, but I felt like I made up with it in driving and ball striking and chipping.
Q. Walk me through 18 there, the drive and then the approach.
PRESTON SUMMERHAYS: The drive, I mean, nothing really changes with that drive just whatever situation.  So I just got up there and I knew that I could get it past -- keep it short of the bunker but get it past the rough, so I did that.
Then the wedge shot, me and my dad were prepared.  We knew where to leave it.  Hit a great wedge shot to ten feet.
Q. What's the mindset going into tomorrow now?
PRESTON SUMMERHAYS: I mean, just -- I don't know.  Just win.
Q. Yeah.
PRESTON SUMMERHAYS: Yeah, just do whatever I can to get myself ahead and get on to the finals.
Q. What does it mean to you to be a quarterfinalist in the U.S. Junior Am?
PRESTON SUMMERHAYS: It means a lot.  It means a lot even, I mean, playing Akshay, the No. 1 junior in the world.  He's such a great player.  To just play him and win is just -- means a lot.
Q. What's something that was on for your game today that you'll look to continue?
PRESTON SUMMERHAYS: I would say my irons and ball striking were really on today.  I felt like I hit it close a lot.  I think I only chipped like twice all day, uh-huh.
