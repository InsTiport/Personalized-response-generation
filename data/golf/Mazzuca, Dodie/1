Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  I can't remember.  Eight feet and made the putt.  I hit a 5-iron. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.) 
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  Yeah, I birdied the next hole.  I hit my wedge and I got about a 70-yard shot to the hole and hit it about 5 feet and made the putt.  And then I bogied the next hole, hit it right into the bunker and didn't get it up and down. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  About 20 feet. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  Yeah, I birdied the next hole, chipped in from the front of the green, hit it short.  It came back and I chipped in. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  Probably about 25 paces from the front.  That's about right.  Yeah, 25 paces from the front.  And then I birdied 8.  I don't even remember what that was like. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  6, a Par 5, I birdied.  Same thing, with a wedge, close, and knocked it in. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  I think it was almost the same distance, maybe a little less.  I think I hit it 69 yards in to the pin on that one.  I had a good lay-up.  I hit it to about four feet.  And then I birdied 8, had about a 10-footer down the middle. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  Wedge. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  I did not birdie 10.  10 was an up-and-down save.  I parred everything until I got to the Par 5, No. 16, and hit a little less than a 50-yard wedge shot in and hit it to about four feet and made the putt.  And then the other two were pars. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  That was a sand save.  It was awesome. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  Five under. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  Yes, I was lucky with my tee time.  A 7:30 tee time really helps.  The greens were perfect on the front side.  The whole course is in great shape, and that helps.  Putting was key on the front side. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  Yeah, my irons were good.  The greens were soft too.  That helps.  That also helped with the wedge shot, nice and receptive. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)  have you been playing well?
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  It's getting better.  This is usually the time I start to play well, in years past, this time of year. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  I'm trying to break that habit and come out a little earlier, but it's just a pattern.  I think a lot of players go through that.  I also feel a little more comfortable out here and getting use to the new golf courses and stuff. 
 
Q.  You were not here last year.  Karrie was in here the other day talking about how this course was going to play a lot different from the last two years when they played late September, early October.  She said if they continued to play it this time of year they will have to change the setup to make it play longer because of the wind direction.
 
 
Q.  Did it play -- did it feel today like it played really short because of the rain we've had in the last couple of days.
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  I don't really have a power game so it was really perfect for me.  I don't know.  I shouldn't say that.  It was perfect.  Keep it the same.  It doesn't need to be longer.  That's my perspective. 
 
Q.  Do you think somebody else is going to come in substantially lower?
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  I think the scores are going to be low today.  A lot of good players and good course conditions, a good combination for low scores. 
 
Q.  I noticed in the tour book where you wanted Albany on the Futures Tour.  Coming here to New Albany, did that make a difference?
 
DODIE MAZZUCA:  Yes, there's something about that, maybe.  That would be a good thing to carry over.
