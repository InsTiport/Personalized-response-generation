  Q.  How did the round go for you today?   
 CRAIG KANADA:  Really the first two rounds have gone really well.  I drove the ball really well.  I missed one fairway the last two days, and doing that out here with all of the rough and the tightness of the fairways makes the golf course a lot easier.   
  
  Q.  How did the course play today as compared to yesterday, was it different at all?   
 CRAIG KANADA:  Not really.  I think the rain that we had yesterday and last night kept it fairly soft, but yet the fairways are firming up.   
 We're getting some holes -- it's really ideal right now.  It's playing fairly short but the greens are receptive and you can shoot right at the flags.   
  
  Q.  How important were those birdies on the back nine today?   
 CRAIG KANADA:  You know, every one is important because obviously there's a lot of good players here and it's a great field.  You're going to have to play your best if you want to succeed here.   
  
  Q.  And now since you are all done for the day, do you have any plans, are you going to go and see the city at all or work on your game a little bit?   
 CRAIG KANADA:  We're going out to dinner with some family and friends, and that's about it.  I usually stay pretty low-key once the tournament starts, maybe get some rest and maybe get a little workout and come out fresh tomorrow.
