Q. Talk about that run in the middle of the match where you won three straight holes, 8, 9, and 10, to kind of take control there.
KEVIN O'CONNELL: Yeah, so similar to the beginning.  I got off to a reasonably hot start.  I was 2-up after 2 and had a good chance to go 3-up after 3.
He pulled even.  I think he three-putted 7 to keep it all square, which was kind of a big momentum swing for me because I was 2-up and could have gone 1-down leaving that green.
Anyway, yeah, birdied 9, birdied 10.
Q. How did you birdie those two holes?
KEVIN O'CONNELL: And I guess par'd 8.  Hit it in close on both holes.  I hit it four feet on 9 and about two feet -- he conceded on 10.
Q. What did you have and what did you hit into 9?
KEVIN O'CONNELL: Yeah, 147 into 9; hit pitching wedge.  And then 166 or so into 10; hit 9-iron in there pretty close.  Yeah, that was huge.
I mean, both times I got 3-up on the back nine he came back with a birdie on a really tough pin.  He did it on 11 and he did it on 14.
Yeah, the turn there was definitely huge.
Q. And does this feel a little different playing in your home state in a national championship?
KEVIN O'CONNELL: Yeah, a little bit.  I'm obviously used to the bermuda grass.  From that perspective I'm used to the conditions.  My first USGA event in my home state, so yeah, certainly seems like a little bit of a...
Q. Anybody following you around?
KEVIN O'CONNELL: Mom and dad are here; wife was here for the stroke play rounds.  Yeah.
