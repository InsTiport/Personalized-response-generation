Q.  You were two up, and then you were all squared, and then what happened?

KELLY ROBBINS:  They went to two up pretty quickly, I guess.  Unfortunately, I mean, Emilee and I played pretty solid early, and then made a few mistakes.  Didn't make any birdies today.  I started hitting wayward irons, and then she had a couple opportunities, and I am sure she is disappointed in not making them, but we had a good day and it's hard to hang in there and try to get something going.
Q.  What was the key to your almost comeback?

KELLY ROBBINS:  Oh, well we were  -- actually, they made bogey over here on 15, and then Emilee parred on 16 to stay two up, and then we won 17 to go to one up.
Q.  What  -- that turned it around. 

KELLY ROBBINS:  Well, you are always trying to do that:  You know, I think if we knew the key to do it, we would do it all the time.
Q.  How do you think this is going to affect the team this morning?

KELLY ROBBINS:  Not one bit.  We are in great shape right now.  We are in better shape right now than we have been in years past going into Sunday, so I don't think we are too concerned about it, playing really good from the start.  This is a really strong team and we will turn it up tomorrow.
