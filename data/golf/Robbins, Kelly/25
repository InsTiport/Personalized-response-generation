KELLY ROBBINS:  I played Lora Fairclough  today.  I had the privilege of playing with her all  three days.  Today I played really well.  I kind of  showed up today.  I had a rough two days prior, I think  I won four out of the first 6 holes type of thing.  She  still was hot; made a couple of putts on me during the  middle of the round.  But I was able to birdie a couple  of holes out there and hang tough and just overall, hit  it closer, rolled the ball better.  I just felt really  good, obviously, especially getting off to a better  start.
