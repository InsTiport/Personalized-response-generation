KELLY ROBBINS:  I can only say it was very difficult.  It was one of those days for everybody.  Just when you had a little momentum going you'd lose it right away.  We were just glad to get the half.

Q.  How was the greens?

KELLY ROBBINS:  Actually the greens are great.  They're in really good shape right now.  Like you said after they dried out they did get a little firmer, and the ball did end up rolling a little bit better.  Earlier they were kind of sticking to the ground a little bit obviously with the fog and the dew.  But the course is in great shape.
