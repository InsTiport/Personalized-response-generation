KELLY ROBBINS:  We lost a little bit of momentum.  We just knew we were playing that good.  Pat was knocking down the stick all day, left me a few four- or five-footers every now and again.  But she played great, she putted well, and this is why we play. 
 

Q.  Pat, this is your first match.  Have you ever felt pressure like this before?
 
PAT HURST:  Nothing like this.  You know, see, I can't really talk right now, I am just so excited. It's so much fun and I just can't wait to get going again. 
 

Q.  That was quite a shot to 18.  What a great shot.
 
KELLY ROBBINS:  Thanks, you guys. 
 

Q.  Obviously, we're very early here, but it's an emotional moment for you.
 
PAT HURST:  Can you tell?  I like it when it's emotional. It's a lot of fun.  Can't wait to get going.  Thanks.
