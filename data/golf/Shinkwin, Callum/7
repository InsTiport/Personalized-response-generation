 Q.  Great score of seven under par for the first round, how was that for you?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: It was very good.  I was warming up on the range and I had to pop into the physio truck.  My back was stiffening up big time.  So I had to go in there and get them to loosen it up.  It took me four holes to get used to it and suddenly it opened up again.   
 Q.  Even better showing, you double-bogeyed 11, your second.  Could have put you off the round but you stuck on?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: I was even thinking about maybe not carrying on after about three holes.  My back wasn't feeling good at all and I managed to hit a good wedge shot into the par 5, made birdie and holed a nice long putt on the next one and hit another big tee shot again which it felt great.   
 Q.  So just had to stretch it a bit more?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: Stretch.  A bad night's sleep I guess.  It was just a bad feeling.  It opened up and felt great.   
 Q.  How is the course playing?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: Quite slow, soft.  You can see there's a bit of a drought here but other than that it's playing not bad.   
 Q.  And looking at possibilities toward the rest of the week?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: Yeah, just keep doing what I'm doing, get a nice warm down and feel good for tomorrow.
