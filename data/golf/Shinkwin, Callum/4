 Q.  You were saying yesterday how you played a lot of links golf as an amateur.  How important was that experience taking you into what's been the worst day of the three so far?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: Yeah, I don't think I've played in wind and rain like that before.  It was coming down at a really bad angle, especially the mid part of the round.  It was well off the left, horrible for me.  Managed to grind it out and get through level par.   
 Q.  Your eagle must have been pleasing in the conditions?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: Yeah, managed to hit my best drive of the day.  Hit a drive and pitching wedge in to tap-in.  Literally walk up, tap it in.  Nice, makes your round a lot easier.   
 Q.  Is the case today of not going in the wrong direction almost consolidating, rather than chasing birdies?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: That's what happens when you have a tough day.  You can't chase birdies.  Pars on tough holes are birdies, and you make the birdies when they come.   
 Q.  How do you feel headed to tomorrow?  Nicely placed atop the leaderboard, big event in a Rolex Series, and a chance to get into The Open next week.  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: I don't really look at that too much.  I just want to take it one shot at a time and try and shoot the best score I can.
