Q. How pleased are you overall with your round?
CALLUM SHINKWIN: I'm pleased.  I played nicely.  I holed a few putts, which is a change, so I was happy with that.
Q. Still finding your feet on The European Tour.  You've got a great caddie on the bag, Dave McNeilly, has caddied for great players, the likes of Faldo and Goosen.  How much of a difference and how much of a help is it to have someone like that?
CALLUM SHINKWIN: It's good.  He's got quite the same personality as me, so we have quite a good laugh, as well.  Normally we hang back but today with the new rule, pace of play, we had to walk quite fast.  He's really good.
Q. And you're a bit of a new name for us all here and we want to show the people at home exactly what you're all about, and you got your card through a third-place finish at The Race to Oman final, and that moved you to 13th on the Challenge Tour rankings to get your card, but it wasn't the only great thing that happened in your family that week; is that right?
CALLUM SHINKWIN: My cousin, he's 27, and he's a light heavyweight; big prospect in the boxing.
Q. And learning these golf courses, it's a brand new experience for you being here in Qatar, different style of golf course, are you having to pick the brains of the other players while you're here?
CALLUM SHINKWIN: A little bit.  I mean, I arrived on Sunday night, so I've had one day to practise because the Wednesday start.  Me and Dave went out by ourselves for the whole practise round on Monday.
