 Q.  How would you sum that up?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: It's been a very good week.  End of the day, I'll be more than happy to finish second but the win was on my mind and didn't happen.   
 Q.  You had a great round up until that 18th hole.  Were there a few nerves because you knew what was at stake in a Rolex Series event?  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: Of course I did but to be fair it was nothing like what everyone probably thinks.  I hit a great second shot in and finished in a divot on a downslope of the bunker.  I had no shot, really.   
But it's all a learning curve and obviously if you win, you have to have luck on your side.  It wasn't there for me.   
 Q.  You're into The Open Championship for next week and you've secured your card for next season, which is a goal for really sort of climbing the ladder on The European Tour.  It's massively important.  
CALLUM SHINKWIN: It is, yeah.  Three months ago -- but now I've got enough ranking points to hopefully be in The Race to Dubai at the end of the year and hopefully I can carry on into next week.
