Q. How pleasing was that eagle on 18?
CALLUM SHINKWIN: Yeah, a couple of dropped shots, few mistakes but other than that played great.
Q. It was a little bit of a mixed bag on front nine.  It was a bit sort of an up-and-down; was that feeling your way into the course with the sort of breezy conditions?
CALLUM SHINKWIN: A little bit.  It was a bit like my week last week.  I had a lot of birdies, a lot of bogeys.  And then playing today, starting off with two birdies and two bogeys, and I played the back nine with no dropped shots, much nicer.
Q. A couple of rounds of 68 last week.  Is there a feeling that you're trying to introduce a little bit of consistency in the game and you'll be heading in the right direction?
CALLUM SHINKWIN: Yeah, my game's been not great this season.
Q. Talking about this kind of golf course, do you enjoy links golf and what sort of a test has it been out there today?
CALLUM SHINKWIN: It's a new links course but it's playing bouncy.  I love links golf.  I played it as an amateur.  Did good around here last year, at Castle Stuart last year, and it's nice to come back.
