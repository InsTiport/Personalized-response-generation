 Q.  Okay, so close over there on 18.  Overall, what was your experience here like this week?  
JING YAN: I think it was -- at the beginning of the week I really didn't know where my game was at, how low I could go.  I know this course is really challenging with the amount of birdies you have to make.   
But I certainly wasn't making that many putts today so I knew I had to hit it close.  I was pretty happy with the way I hit it today.   
Overall this week has given me a lot of confidence to make a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  What does it do to your mindset heading into more of the summer stretch?  
JING YAN: Yeah, it's definitely a good sign of the work that I've been putting in.  Especially starting the year off well but then hitting a couple road bumps.  You need that little bit of boost of confidence to make sure you don't get dragged down with the bad performances.   
Yeah, excited for the upcoming tournaments.   
 Q.  And what's there to take away from your game now heading into your next one?  
JING YAN: Just try to enjoy it a little more on the course and keep doing what I'm doing.  Hopefully make a few more putts.
