Q. Awesome round today.
JING YAN: Thank you.
Q. What was working out there for you?
JING YAN: I hit the ball a lot better than I did, especially from probably the second or third hole on.  Pretty much hit it where I wanted to.
Back nine of the first day and the front nine of yesterday I was struggling a little bit with my long game.  From the back nine yesterday to today I was really happy with my ball striking.  That helped me a lot out here.
Q. Huge.  We talked about like how important it is to make sure that your ball striking, being more accurate out here and giving yourself great birdie chances.  Were the putts rolling differently today?
JING YAN: Today the putts were rolling pretty good.  The greens were rolling pretty pure, a little bit faster than yesterday I feel like personally.
Took me a couple holes to get used to the speed, but, yeah, I was hitting it close, so had couple 15, 20-footers for birdie.
Q. Then you had an eagle on 16.
JING YAN: Uh-huh.
Q. What was the game plan there?
JING YAN: I actually never had 3-wood, which I hit into that hole today, before.  It was kind of strange to hit that club, but felt a bit like par-3 so really tried to go at the pin.  Make sure I hit it far enough past the slope that it runs onto the green because it's rough before then.
Sherman hit a really good shot, who I played with.  She came from the opposite side of the hole, so I was able to get a little teach on the line, which helped.
Q. What's the game plan going into tomorrow?
JING YAN: I don't know.  Not thinking too much about it.  Just like try to play as best I can and hopefully just do the same thing or better.
