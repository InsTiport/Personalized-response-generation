  Q. That was a great round, 69, just one bogey and four birdies.  Tell me about your day, how you felt you played today.
 JING YAN:   I thought I started off pretty good but I didn't make some putts in the first couple of holes, and then there was a stretch from 15 to 18 where you have a couple pretty difficult holes and I didn't really hit the ball where I wanted to.
 But on the back nine I felt like I was striking it much better, so I was able to stick a couple and make some birdies.
 Q. What do you think changed from nines?  Like you say, you had the one birdie and one bogey on the front, which was your back today, correct?
 JING YAN:   Uh-huh.
 Q. And then a bunch on the front.
 JING YAN:   I like the look of the front nine a lot more.  I feel like you got a lot more chances to attack the pin, and with the way it's set up it just fits my eye.  Yeah, more comfortable there.
 Q. The weather conditions are a little different today than yesterday.
 JING YAN:   For sure.
 Q. Yesterday you played in the afternoon, so battled through the cold and the wet and the rain.
 JING YAN:   Yeah.
 Q. Today it's chilly but it's bright and sunny.  Did that help, too?
 JING YAN:   Yeah, for sure.  It was a huge difference.  Yesterday with the wind it was going to be difficult anyway, but we got lucky.  It didn't rain too heavily.  It could be much worse, so it's good.
 Q. Could be worse.  You are on to the weekend.  What are your thoughts as you head into Saturday and Sunday here?
 JING YAN:   Just have fun and try to shoot some low scores.
