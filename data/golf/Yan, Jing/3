 Q.  Nice to make a move on moving day?  What went well?  
JING YAN: I think I wasn't striking the ball very well the first two days, and just told myself, lots of fairways and greens today and I think I did pretty well in that area.  And I was putting pretty well, so as long as I gave myself opportunities, I knew I could make some putts.   
 Q.  How do you like Woburn and how does the course set up for you?  
JING YAN: I really like it because there's lots of opportunities for low scoring, but also, like you have to earn them in a way.  You have to make sure that you're in good positions and really hit good shots and then yeah, so I like the fact that it's challenging but also gives you a chance to really put a good number out there.   
 Q.  How has this season been going?  I think it's probably your best.  What's going well for you this year?  
JING YAN: I think the main thing is just during the start of the season, getting a lot of confidence in my long game, especially working with my coach, Ted Oh, who has helped me a lot.  In that aspect, it's improved.  That's one of the worst parts of my game.  I know that being such an important part would really help, and then these last couple stretches, I've putted pretty well on occasions, which helps, too.  Happy with the overall state of my game.   
 Q.  What did you and Ted work on in the off-season that really made a difference this year?  
JING YAN: Just a lot of swing changes.  Well, not really a lot, but I think the key was that I was just really missing the ball kind of all over the place, and I think before that I was really just struggling overall with just not keeping it very simple and not very -- not getting the right things correct in my technique and that's what we worked on in the off-season and throughout this year.   
 Q.  What's your plan for the final round tomorrow?  
JING YAN: Just try to putt another low number out there.  Same thing, fairways and greens.  Looks like the leaders are playing really well, so I'll just focus on my game.
