 Q.  They brought you to all square and then you won the two par-5s on the back nine to go to 2-up again.  What happened on those holes?  How did you keep up the momentum?  
ALICE CHEN: T killed it.  We just kind of -- I haven't been playing that well all day, but Tot all the time, she was just always there.  She kept on giving herself -- I mean, we both did, just kept on giving ourselves chances for birdies, so she made those birdies, and they were really clutch.  Tell him about the long putt.   
TAYLOR TOTLAND: It wasn't that long.  It was like, what --   
ALICE CHEN: It was like 15, 20 feet.   
TAYLOR TOTLAND: On 13.  But honestly, we didn't really play all that great.  It was a grind all day.  Just kind of taking whatever we can get and trying to take advantage of it, which we did a good job of.  But yeah, it was a grind for us for sure.  But Alice came through huge on that last putt.  Like that was a right-to-lefter.  It was a tricky putt, and she came in clutch.   
ALICE CHEN: And I didn't make any putts all day until that last one, so making that 10-footer on the last hole with like -- it was a good 3.  It was pretty slopey, so that felt really good just going into the afternoon.   
 Q.  And you know when you have a lead and you know you have to play a second match, do you start to feel the pressure to try to wrap it up as quickly as you can?  
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Not really, no.  Did you try to -- I mean, I'm kind of hungry.   
 Q.  Yeah, the sooner you win, the sooner you can get in.  
TAYLOR TOTLAND: I want to get on the range for a little bit.  I don't know when we tee off next.
