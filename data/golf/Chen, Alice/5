Q. Looking at your scorecard, seven straight birdies from 6 to 12.  Give me some details on that; what happened in that run there?
ALICE CHEN: Well, we kind of got off to a slow start.  Yeah, it was kind of scary.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Yeah, we started off slow, but we were just really attacking the flag and gave ourselves really good birdie opportunities and took advantage of them.
Q. Was there -- what flipped it, so you're all square through 6, so what happened on 7 to give you the lead back that you never relinquished?
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Is that the one I was -- was there our first birdie and Brigitte also birdied?
Q. On 6 you both birdied to stay all square, and then seven you birdied and they made par.
ALICE CHEN: I birdied 6 and then Brigitte made one on top of me, and then on seven --
TAYLOR TOTLAND: I don't remember seven.  Gosh, I'm so terrible at remembering stuff.
Q. It was pushed up to 287 today.
ALICE CHEN: Yeah, so I actually had a bad drive.  I was like off to the right and in the dirt, and somehow my wedge got to stop to like three, four feet.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: She hit like a rock star shot.  Yeah.  I think you're thinking of a different hole.
ALICE CHEN: I thought that one was short.  And the next was a par-5?
Q. Yeah, you went birdie-birdie on a par-5 and a par-3 at the turn.
ALICE CHEN: And then you birdied the par-5, 8.
Q. What happened on the par-3 ninth?  Who hit it close?
ALICE CHEN: We both stuck it really close.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: I made my birdie putt.
ALICE CHEN: And I just practiced it in.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: I ended up making it.  And then birdied 10.
ALICE CHEN: I think we both stuck it again.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: And 11?
Q. 11 both teams made birdie, and then you birdied the other par-3, 12, to go 5-up.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: I'm so bad at remembering.  They're all kind of like going together.  But it was like a super good team effort.  Alice really carried me on the front nine because I didn't start off well at all, and she had great par saves.
ALICE CHEN: Yeah, they were like long par putts.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Yeah.
ALICE CHEN: And then we got like into a rhythm of finally easing up and just being relaxed and having fun out there and started sticking them close and making the putts.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: We were super amped up in the beginning.
ALICE CHEN: Yeah.
Q. Your two stroke play rounds you got off to good starts on both days, and today it took you a few holes, got in a battle before you got it going.
ALICE CHEN: Yeah, and we had good par putts on 1 and 2 and then started having like those good birdie putts coming in.
Q. Any advantage with the heat today to kind of finish up early with tomorrow being a double round day?  Do you think it helps to get off the course?
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Yeah.
ALICE CHEN: Yeah, totally agree.  Just going to go back and relax.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Go to the beach.
Q. You've played three good days in a row.  What's your mindset going into tomorrow now?
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Just keep having fun.  We've been doing a really good job.  I think that's helping.
ALICE CHEN: Putts are rolling well.  Things are feeling good.  Just keep on being confident and trusting our preparation.
Q. Difference between stroke and match play?
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Ooh, it's somewhat --
ALICE CHEN: You're kind of aggressive all the time.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: You have to keep your foot on the pedal the entire time.
ALICE CHEN: And expect that your opponent chips it in or makes a long putt.
Q. Because you have to be in the moment, right?
ALICE CHEN: Yeah, and that's just the mentality of it or just expect it because it's a lot easier to expect it and then have them not make it versus not expecting it and then they make it, and then now your birdie putt that you were supposed to win the hole with is a birdie putt that you have to make to tie the hole.  So it's just always better if you expect that they make it in.
Q. Did that happen today?
ALICE CHEN: I think there was that -- yeah, when Rossi made it in and then you made it on top of her.
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Oh, yeah.
ALICE CHEN: I think that was 12 -- the par-3, 11?
TAYLOR TOTLAND: Oh, 12.
ALICE CHEN: 12?  Yeah, so it's just such a mental game.  You can't ever let yourself have something happen and catch you by surprise.
Q. And get down.
ALICE CHEN: Yeah.  I think being expectant helps.
