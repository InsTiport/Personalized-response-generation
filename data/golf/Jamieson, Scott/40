 Q. Sum up your round. 
 SCOTT JAMIESON: I'm a little disappointed just now. Obviously two 75s wasn't what I would have liked to have done, but it's nice to be here and be in the mix, and hopefully I can learn from the experience. 

 Q. How's that been like to be playing in such a massive tournament?
 SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, it's great to be here and be a part of it, but like you say, it's disappointing because I feel as though I could have performed a lot better. I hit the ball pretty well from tee to green, just couldn't take any of the chances I managed to create.

 Q. Was it the conditions? What was it do you think that didn't work for you?
 SCOTT JAMIESON: Like I said, tee to green was okay, I just didn't hole any of my putts when I did take a chance, and then any mistakes I made tends to lead to a bogey around here.
