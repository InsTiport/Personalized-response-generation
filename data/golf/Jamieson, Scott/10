Q. First one out, very early this morning, first one back in with a score of 67.  You must be very pleased with that?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, definitely.  Bogey-free round, which is great here at Wentworth.  Obviously we had the best of the conditions, not a breath of air, and the greens are so good this year.  To be the first people on all 18 greens, they are just a great surface to putt on.
Q. Can you put into context for people how different it is this year from what it's been in previous years, particularly the greens.
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, I think they have just done such a fantastic job.  There's a real premium on hitting the fairways because the greens are firmer.  You know, if you're not hitting the fairways, you've then got to think very hard about where you want your next shot to go, because it's really difficult to get it on the green with a kind of mid-iron.  Yeah, they have done a great job and it's going to be a good week.
Q. Two Top 10s already for you this year.  It's been a pretty decent start to 2017?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, yeah, nice to get the points up early in the year.  We're coming into the real thick of it now with obviously the Rolex Series.  There's a lot of points to play for.  I think it makes those tournaments a little easier if you know your job's secure.
Q. Obviously if the weather stays like this, it could be a very low score that wins this year.
SCOTT JAMIESON: Possibly.  Depend s.  I think the wind is maybe to blow a bit the next couple days, which will probably firm the golf course up a bit, as well and make it that bit trickier.  Yeah, we'll see how it goes.
