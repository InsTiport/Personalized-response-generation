 Q.  After a tough season, that's a lot more like it?  
SCOTT JAMIESON: A couple of Top-10s in Holland and Italy, played okay in Germany, as well but managed to stumble amid all the fog delays and missed the cut.  One great week can change your season.   
 Q.  What are you doing better now?  What's improved?  
SCOTT JAMIESON: Just a bit of everything.  Trying to be more patient, as well.  It's so easy when you're struggling.  One bad shot and you feel like you're going to miss another cut.  It's not going to be your day but yeah, just trying to accept as much as I can and then relax and refocus.   
 Q.  A lot of crosswinds out there, I guess you have to be on top of your game to control your ball?  
SCOTT JAMIESON: A little different wind to be had in practice, it was a bit more up-and-down the course.  So it made some holes a bit easier, and it made some holes a little tougher.  But yeah, if you get control over your ball, you can shoot low I think.   
 Q.  Who are you playing with?  
SCOTT JAMIESON: I've played did you know can four out of the six years and we always play at Leopard Creek.  I always stay at his house.  We're friends so it's nice to know what you're coming into as far as your amateur partner.   
Playing St. Andrews tomorrow, favourite golf course in the world, and hopefully I'll have one of my favourite days in the world.
