 Q.  Bogey, par, double-bogey start.  What's going through your mind as you walk off that third green?  
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, it wasn't a great start.  They are tough holes.  It's a tough stretch of the golf course, the first three holes, especially the way the wind was blowing today.  The last thing you need to do in that situation is panic.  Just try and take a wee minute to yourself and start again.   
 Q.  Seven birdies in nine holes, was a fantastic way to get things back on track.  
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, the putter warmed up.  Hit a couple of nice shots and yeah, that was certainly a nice way to turn it around.   
 Q.  Plenty of players are going in the opposite direction this afternoon.  Is that a sign of, obviously this time of day, the greens are wearing, had a lot of players on them.  Is that something you found?  
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, they are just firm.  It's difficult to hit it close.  So you've got to be on the fairway, if you want hit it close to the hole.   
 Q.  And tactics for the weekend, it looks as though whatever happens, you're going to be there or thereabouts going into the weekend, which is a fantastic position to be in.  
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, exactly.  It's obviously a massive tournament.  That's why we play, so if I can just keep doing what I've been doing the first two days and hopefully I'm in a good place.
