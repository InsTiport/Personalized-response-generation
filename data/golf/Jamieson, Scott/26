Q.   Your thoughts on starting with 7‑under par around here? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, 7‑under par on any golf course is always a good score, especially out there, although the conditions were just perfect this morning, we didn't have much wind and the greens were rolling great.   So it's a great chance to post a low one.

Q.   The way you've been playing, and your form here to start the tournament last year, you were looking forward to this, weren't you? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, absolutely.   Obviously it was a fast start to the year. 
The last couple of weeks have not been as good as I would like them to be, but coming back here after a good week last year, it's nice.   

Q.   One of the tournaments you want to do well at? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, I think the three in the desert, they are sort of iconic events for a long time.   Seems to me they are, anyway.   As a kid, I was watching the guys come to the desert early in the year, and yeah, it's fantastic to be here and competing.

Q.   Are you conscious of the form you're in, or do you just let it happen?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   I think the secret is to let it happen.   When you start thinking about it, that's when things probably don't go as well as they should do.   So, yeah, I'm just trying to let it happen.

Q.   But it is a balance, because you can't stop yourself thinking, oh, this has worked, and the minute you analyse, it can go wrong sometimes?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, but you've just got to do, the old clichÃ©, do what you do best, and stick to it. 

Q.   Any indication what we can expect from the week in terms of scores overall? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Well, I think the forecast is good for the rest of the week as today.   I think we'll have some wind so I doubt the scoring will be as low as what we see today.
