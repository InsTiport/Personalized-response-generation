Q. Tell us about the hole-in-one.
SCOTT JAMIESON: It was a very good shot.  Was a good shot, not a lucky one.  Feels nice to have won the car as well, obviously.  We had 191.  The wind was just picking up a bit, so we felt 6-iron wasn't going to get all the way back to the hole.
So yeah, me and my caddie, we talked about it and we decided that 5, if we wanted to get it close, then 5 was the club.  Worked out perfect.
Q. First one on The European Tour?
SCOTT JAMIESON: First one in competition, yeah.  I've had one in a Pro-Am before.
Q. What a wonderful reward.
SCOTT JAMIESON: It would have been annoying to have one and not get any reward.  But obviously any hole-in-one helps the scorecard, as well.
Q. When you look it over, it's a lovely piece of machinery, isn't it?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, it certainly is.  Yeah, look forward to picking it up.
Q. Any long journeys planned?
SCOTT JAMIESON: I might have to start driving through Europe this year.
