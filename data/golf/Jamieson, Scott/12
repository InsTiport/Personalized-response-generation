Q. Looks like you've done your job this week and got your Tour card for next week.  How does it feel?
SCOTT JAMIESON: It's obviously a big relief.  It was a bit of a struggle the first half of the season but since the Czech Masters, I've started to play a lot better.  Nice to sneak over the line just at the end but it's obviously not where I want to be.
At the end of the year I want to be more at the top end of things and not having to have sleepless nights or whatever it may be.  Yeah, it's a relief.  There's going to be a lot of guys that just miss out.  Some of them good friends, as well.  Feel for them.
Q. What have you learned this week?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Last week at the British Masters, the round that I had on the Friday to make the cut there was massive, being such a big event.  That was nice to know that I do really do it under the gun with the card on the line.  Without that finish, I would have needed a really big finish this week.
Friday again here, 7-under, when I was kind of on the cut line after the first round.  It's nice to be able to do that when required but obviously got to find a way to be able to do that a little more often.
Q. Lots of positives to take out of this week?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, like I say, since the Czech Masters this week, there's been a lot of good scores.  Need to find the form to do that more often.
