Q.   Thoughts on a victory at the end? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, obviously delighted to get the first win under the belt.   Wasn't the finish to the match I wanted after being in a fairly strong position. 

Q.   You looked in command so what was it that happened; did you get edgy? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   He just threw a couple holes at me at the start and I threw a couple back at the end.   Once your opponent‑‑ if he puts it in position out there, there's a few holes out there where it was fairway or lost ball, and that was the case.

Q.   I take it you like the place, despite what happened at 16 and 17?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   No, it's a stunning golf course and it's fun for match play, that's for sure.

Q.   Are you enjoying the whole experience of match play?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, it's what we used to play growing up.   That was the majority of the golf, so it's nice to get to play it in professional because it doesn't happen often. 

Q.   A match you were completely in control of, 3‑up with three to play and becomes 2‑up, 1‑up; first emotion, relief? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, neither of us played great to be honest.   He threw a few holes at me early on and chucked a couple back at the end, so nice to hole a putt when it mattered.

Q.   How were the emotions over that putt; were you thinking, don't blow this, 3‑up, three to play? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, I don't think you can avoid those emotions, but you need to put them to one side and just try to hole the putt really.

Q.   What do you think of this golf course? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   It's stunning.   There's always something nice to look at, that's for sure.   It's a perfect golf course for match play as well, and if you tee off first and get your ball in position, it makes your opponent's shot very difficult. 

Q.   You're playing ThorbjÃ¸rn Olesen a rising star in the European Tour; thoughts on that?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, I think it will be a great game.   I have to play well if I want to get my second win.
