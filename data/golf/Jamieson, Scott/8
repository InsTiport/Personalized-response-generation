Q. It's been a fantastic Saturday for you and you got off to a really fast start today?
SCOTT JAMIESON: I did.  It helped my playing partner, Pete, had a nice hole-in-one there on the third and he followed it up with a birdie on 4 and felt like my game, he was leaving me for dead.  He was driving me along initially and we fed off each other all day.  It was great.
The fourth isn't reachable, but then you have 7, 13, 14, depending on the wind direction.  That's what helped today is the wind direction.  If you get the tee shot correct, eagle is a realistic chance.
Q. Almost bogey-free, as well.  You both had a similar putt with the ball rolling around the end, which is slightly infuriating.  How pleased are you with today and the way it's elevated you up the leaderboard?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Obviously finishing with a bogey always leaves a sour taste in your mouth.  I didn't do much wrong to be honest.  Hit a great tee shot, just a really difficult fairway to hit today with the way the wind was blowing.  And then had a bit of a snaggy lie in the rough there.  And then the putt, mine and Pete's almost exactly the same, looked like they were in the middle and not quite.
Q. With all the ranking points up for grabs, that's a massive boost looking towards the end of the year already.
SCOTT JAMIESON: Exactly.  I think there's so much at stake with these Rolex Series events that it's important that you come to these events with your A Game and you try and take advantage because you can play well in the wrong tournaments and not really get anywhere.
