  SCOTT JAMIESON:   It wasn't quite as good from tee‑to‑green as it was yesterday.   Probably still hit my fair share of greens but didn't hit any real close like I had done the first couple of days.   I had an early 3‑putt where I hit it about 12 feet past the hole, so that kind of caught me off guard a bit, so pace wasn't great all day on the greens.   
So didn't hit many putts that looked like they were going in.   But 2‑under is a good score when you don't have your A Game so looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Any reason why that putt should go sailing past?   
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Just hit it too hard.   I hit a similar putt yesterday and I actually felt as though I hit it too hard yesterday and only went a foot past and then they get told that we were expecting some wind and they were not cutting the greens.   Again that was my only bogey of the round, so, you know, it's also pretty solid.   That's good stuff.   
   
 Q.   We always use the word patience out here but this course in particular, you know the chances can come later on?  
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Absolutely.   Three par 5s in the back nine, you hit good tee shots, you can knock it on in two on all of them.   So level par, even 1‑over on the front nine is no disgrace, because you're going to have chances coming hope.  
   
 Q.   You said the last couple of days about the way you finished in Qatar, presumably that makes you feel all the more confident and competitive?   
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, absolutely.   That was a real good last couple of rounds I had there.   I felt as though I was starting to hit my shots right where I'm intending to hit them which is a good thing in this game.  
I was feeling pretty good coming into this week.   
   
 Q.   Do you have a look back, we are told to look forward in this game but you must look back on good performances last year and learn from when you're in contention?   
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, it's just about experience and feeling comfortable in the situation.   So again, playing with Martin again today was another great experience.   I got to play with him a couple of times last year, so it's just more experience in the tank to build up.   
   
 Q.   Martin Kaymer, Rory McIlroy, Lee Westwood, all around you, Thomas BjÃ¶rn, good field to be involved?  
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Sure, that's why I started playing this game, to rub shoulders with these guys.   It's just looking forward to tomorrow and test my game against them and under the pressure of a final round.
