 Q.   What's the verdict standing here now?  
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Extremely disappointed just now, just to come up one shot shy after I had umpteen chances out there.   So it's disappointing.   But all in all, pleased.   
   
 Q.   And a chance at the last‑‑  
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, that would have been nice.   It was looking good for a while.   I actually didn't see it.   I was hoping to hear a big roar there but not quite.   
   
 Q.   And for Louis Oosthuizen, a consolation that someone of his calibre shot a 66 to beat you in the end?  
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, like you say, he's a good player, he's Major Champion, and I knew that at least one out of the three of those guys that were five shots behind were going to shoot a low round.   So I thought if I could shoot 3‑ or 4‑under it would be enough.   But didn't quite manage to do that.   
It was a good start and then back to zero on 5.   But you know, I played very well from tee‑to‑green for the most part today, which again is something I can take a lot of pride and confidence from moving forward.   It's tough but more learning for me and hopefully I can use it to my advantage in the future.     
Of course there's nerves involved, trying to win any tournament, you're always nervous.   So you're always a bit nervous but I think I handled it well, certainly from tee‑to‑green.   Just didn't putt as well as I had done early in the week.   So it's another step in the right direction and in The Race to Dubai.
