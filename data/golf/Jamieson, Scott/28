  PAUL SYMES:   How do you reflect on another great day? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, another great day.   I didn't play as well as I did the first two days, especially yesterday from tee‑to‑green.   But managed to score well, which is the main thing.   So yeah, delighted to be in the position I'm in. 
PAUL SYMES:   And you said downstairs you didn't strike it as well as, but you scored well; is that kind of a sign of your sort of growing maturity that you can grind out a score maybe? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Well, nice of you to say so. 
Yeah, possibly.   I mean, you know, there's places to miss it off the tee.   You can miss it, even though you might miss a five, you can miss it on the correct side and still have a chance on the green, and also, you know, if you miss a few greens in the correct spot, you get a chance at up‑and‑down. 
So yeah, when you're not playing as well, you probably have to think a lot more than when things are going well.   So I was able to do that today. 
PAUL SYMES:   I guess the eagle sort of really kick started the round after a slightly dodgy start.
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, it was a bit of a slow start, especially compared to yesterday.   So it was nice to hit a great 3‑iron to about five feet, so that really got me going. 
PAUL SYMES:   And obviously you might be a bit nervous tomorrow, but do you think after the win at the Nelson Mandela, that will help you keep calm, knowing you've done it before? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, obviously slightly different circumstances, but I said to a few people since winning, that it was‑‑ I was very grateful that I got to the playoff and then won.   Had I got to a playoff and lost, you know, I obviously would have tried to‑‑ would have preferred to have won it in regulation. 
But just that experience in the playoff, you know, having to play from the tee, then from the fairway on to the green under the extreme pressure with The European Tour title on the line; I think, I gained a lot of experience, and had I shot one better in the morning and not gotten to experience a playoff, then you know, I wouldn't have learned as much.
  

Q.   The 8th, before that you were not firing on all cylinders, just how important was that in the context of the round? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   That definitely is what got me kick‑started.   I hit a great tee shot and then I was in the middle of the fairway and just had myself a good chance at birdie here, and had a great shot to five or six feet and holed it.

Q.   Under a different scenario, knowing you've got a five‑shot lead like you did at the Nelson Mandela, is that something that you feel you can handle pretty well in the last round? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, I mean, there's still a long way to go, so that will just be to stick to my game plan as best I can.   We'll see if I'm here tomorrow night, don't know. 

Q.   How far ‑‑
SCOTT JAMIESON:   I think I had 198 yards uphill into the wind.

Q.   Obviously the eagle‑‑ but you came up short on the 11th and then you chipped in and had three birdies in a row, that was a turning point in the round there?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Even a par save there‑‑ something I've been able to do all week.   Things that are not quite going your way, I'm able to hole a putt, or like you said on 11 there, possibly looking at a bogey and managed to chip out for a birdie.   So that was perhaps a little bit of a steal, but kept your momentum. 

Q.   Playing with two open champions the last two days, and you also played with Thomas yesterday and you finished in front of them all three days?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, that's quite good.   (Laughter).
Golf is such a funny sport, you can play great or you can have a terrible day. 
But I think most of the guysplayed well today, but Thomas and PÃ¡draig, I think they played fairly well when I played with them. 
So if you had asked me that early in the week, you always have your eye out, comparing yourself to them, but yeah, I managed to beat them both through the week, so that was nice. 

Q.   You seem to like it in the wet and wild; Royal Durban's been wet for the whole week.   Do you love playing in the rain? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   No.   (Laughter) Give me the sunshine any day of the week, I prefer that.   Perhaps I have more experience coming from Scotland in the rain, but I don't choose to go play in the rain, that's for sure. 

Q.   The rain coming down 8, and the eagle followed‑‑
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Is that what happened?   Maybe, I don't know, who knows, but I'll be out there giving it my best tomorrow and we'll see what happens. 

Q.   Some players breeze through Qualifying School and don't look back.   How did you deal with the early disappointments, was that a test of your character? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   You mean my first couple of years?   Yeah, my first two years as a pro, I was just in the abyss.   Guess I saw my round as below the leagues of professional golf, I suppose helps build your character, and I was fortunate enough to keep playing at a time when money wasn't necessarily being chucked at me. 
So, yeah, again, you have to learn how to win at every level of the game and hopefully that will stand me in good stead tomorrow. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, well, from The Challenge Tour‑‑ that dropped me from about 70th in the rankings to just outside the Top‑20 and then I had a strong finish to the season.   That was definitely a huge turning point, yeah. 

Q.   You chipped in on 11 but there were also quite a few pressure up‑and‑downs.   Do you think it will be under pressure in the final round?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, definitely.   Like I said you need to keep the momentum going to shoot a good score.   I need to shoot another good score again tomorrow. 

Q.   Can you put a finger on what was the turning point for you? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, I think I found a little thing in my swing, and that was back at the Austrian Open, which I think was July or August, I'm not sure when it was.   But ever since then, I've been a lot more comfortable with my driver, and so I think I've been hitting quite a bit more fairways than what I have done the first half of last year and my rookie season on Tour.   So yeah, more fairways and greens and birdie opportunities. 

Q.   Who is your coach again?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Alan McCloskey. 

Q.   Hitting a higher ball flight; is that something he's achieved with you as well?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, when I went to Alan, day one, he actually told me that the only part of my game that was good enough to play professional golf was my bunker play (laughter), which was a bit alarming at the time, but maybe that's what I needed to hear.   Because you know, I turned pro being one of the best amateurs in Scotland thinking, you know, you just kind of work your way up the ladder so to speak.
And that was the big thing, knowing I didn't hit the ball high enough on The European Tour.   Amateur golf in Scotland, you're playing links courses all the time and the guys flight it low and they can chip it around the windy links courses.   But when you get out here, you have to be able to stop it on the green with long irons, which again, amateur golf, you don't really have to do. 

Q.   When did you start working with him?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Probably early 2007.   I was one of the first guys, yeah.
