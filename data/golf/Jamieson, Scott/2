Q. 68, 4-under par, nice way to start the event?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, delighted with that. I knew it was going to be tough early with being so cold and fresh, and there's a lot of dew in the rough early doors.
Hitting the fairways was key early in the round, and then Wentworth, you always maybe get chances at 17 and 18 and thankfully I was able to do it.
Q. New dates on the schedule for the event. The field is fantastic. Also the course is looking very good. How does it play? Is it significantly different to previous years?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, I think it's the best I've ever seen it, that's for sure. The fairways are a little fuller, just growing in a little more. Perhaps the May date was just a little too early for it, especially if they had a cold spring. It's the best I've ever seen it and they have done a fantastic job getting it ready.
Q. Your season, is it fair to say has been a consistent season without perhaps the top results you've been looking for, and how important will it be to put in a good performance here?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Obviously it's a massive events, so any performance this week can pay large dividends to how your overall season goes.
Yeah, it's certainly been a consistent season, but lacking in either a win, or I think I've had one third. But yeah, I'd like a few more big finishes.
