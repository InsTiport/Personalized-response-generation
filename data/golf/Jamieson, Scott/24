 Q.   Describe the adrenaline rush you get when you hole a putt like that on the final green to win the match?  
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, it's great.   That's why we play golf I suppose is for moments like that.   It's great to be able to hold a putt when it really matters.  
   
 Q.   1‑down and two to play‑‑  
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Losing 16, managed to win 15, so momentum was with me.   Then unfortunately his 4 beat my 5 on 16.   But then managed to turn it around on 17 and 18.  
   
 Q.   You've played three matches in a day and a half and you might potentially play another three matches in a day and a half; what's the most taxing thing about that?  
SCOTT JAMIESON:   I think mentally.   Hopefully I'm young enough and fit enough to be able to handle the hills around here.   Yeah, I think mentally is the hardest thing just to keep going and try to escape from golf between your shots and it's easy to do here with the beautiful scenery.
