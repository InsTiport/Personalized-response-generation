Q.   Talk about what a good start that is. 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, it's great.   It was a good start.   Played very well from tee‑to‑green.   Gave myself a lot of chances for birdie.   Take a few of people, left a few out there but a great start. 

Q.   On a course that you like?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   I do like this place.   It's a fun week here with my wife, we are staying in the hotel which is a hundred yards from the driving range.   So it's an easy week, so it's a great place to be.

Q.   Makes it nice and relaxed, makes the atmosphere just spot‑on?
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Exactly, you can head back to the room and have a bit of a sleep if you want and then come back over and do some practice, so it's good fun. 

Q.   How much benefit are you feeling from last week? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Well, I'm tired.   But yeah, it's just more experience.   You know, it was great playing under Sam.   There's a lot of good stories we heard and we learned a few things. 
So it's just great to be in that environment, trying to prove yourself under pressure. 

Q.   Despite the tiredness, does playing in a team environment sort of give a kind of kick start or a different feel when you come back out to play individually? 
SCOTT JAMIESON:   Yeah, all of a sudden‑‑ you have not only yourself to let down, you have your nine other teammates, and your foursomes or foursome partner.   So yeah, more relaxed, playing just yourself.
