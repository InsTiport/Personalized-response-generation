Q. 73, difficult conditions today.  Just give us your thoughts?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Well, I just bogeyed the last.  It was really difficult.  I had a few 3-putts on the front nine, which was disappointing.  So I was out in 1-over when it definitely could have been a couple better.
Everything was difficult, especially putting.  You get blown about in the gusts, and then yeah, it was solid on the back nine.  Disappointed with that and bogeyed the last.
Q. Almost a shame that conditions weren't the same as they are now because it's gone quite still.  How tricky was it today with that breeze?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, it was exceptionally tough.  Not only the wind speed was changing all the time but the wind direction.  It was obviously, like I said yesterday, it's such a visually intimidating course, you need to be pretty sure where your ball is going to go.
Q. You're still nicely in the right end of the leaderboard heading into the weekend.
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, in a strong position going into the weekend, so hopefully more of the same.
