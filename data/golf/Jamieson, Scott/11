Q. How were conditions?
SCOTT JAMIESON: It was a little breezy.
Q. Tell me about the round in general?
SCOTT JAMIESON: It was good.  It was solid.  It was pretty good tee-to-green.  Only really hit two tee shots that I wasn't that happy with and I got lucky where they finished up and the shots to the green.  I was able to capitalise.
Q. Talking about luck of the draw, how was it to play out there as the afternoon got on?
SCOTT JAMIESON: I think if you're striking it well and you're scrolling your ball, it's not overly difficult.  I think this was a lot of crosswinds today, so if you get control of your ball, then you know, you can aim for the middle of the greens and take your chances when they come up.
Three of the par 5s are all very reachable because of the way the wind is blowing.  There is a little bit of respite in the middle of some tough holes but there's probably only three holes that are sort of long par 4s back into the wind that are playing tough.  So if you can get it through those without dropping anything, there's still an opportunity.
Q. You've had a top five in the past and you have that in your record; how do you enjoy this format, this course?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, I've done well here before.  Normally it suits a bit of right-to-left off the tee.  I seem to have a bit of left-to-right just now.  But yeah, I think if I can just manage that, hopefully can continue that over the next few days.
Q. I was going to ask about your form.  How do you feel about your rounds this year?
SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, it's been good.  Since August last year, I'm certainly been on an upwards trend.  It was good last week.  Missed the cut last week, but I felt my game was good tee-to-green.  Just didn't quite get the ball in the hole quick enough, which can be a common occurrence in Qatar.
Yeah, good start this week, so hopefully I can take advantage.
