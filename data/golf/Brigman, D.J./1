 Q.  I'm with D.J. Brigman.  Fabulous finish to a 67 with birdies at 8 and 9. 
 DJ BRIGMAN:  I know, yeah.  The greens are pretty firm out there so you're hitting it to an area and you're hoping to get the right bounce.  The greens are so good out here, I think if it's inside 10, 15 feet and you're rolling it good, you've got a shot at rolling it in. 

 Q.  Tell me what's working with the game.  It's been a struggle this year. 
 DJ BRIGMAN:  Yeah, actually I played okay the three tournaments I made the cut.  I've been in good position on the weekend.  I just haven't quite put it together for four rounds.  I feel like my game is in good shape. 
 One of the things I was doing this week is trying to be more specific on the greens.  I'm lining the up the ball with a line to my putt, to putt to a spot, so that's allowing me to kind of focus a little bit better than I have been before. 

 Q.  How long have you been working on that?  How long have you been using that tactic? 
 DJ BRIGMAN:  Just kind of last week.  I missed the cut in Dallas by a shot and I hit it unbelievably well, so I kind of devoted the last two weeks to working on my putting. 

 Q.  This is a course where if you can roll the rock, this is a great course to make some birdies. 
 DJ BRIGMAN:  Absolutely.  Look at the past champions, Zach Johnson, a friend of mind, that guy rolls his rock, so that says it right there. 

 Q.  Great finish, 9-under par, have a good week. 
 DJ BRIGMAN:  Thanks, I just want to keep it going.
