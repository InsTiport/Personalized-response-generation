   ROSS MCGOWAN: Started at 10th, missed a few opportunities early on. Three-putted 12th, then got the shot back at 14th, then unfortunately three-putted 15th as well. Then from 18 onwards, I picked up six birdies in the last ten holes.  
 Highlight was a 50ft putt at the 2nd. Looked in all the way. Always nice to drop one of those long ones.  
 This was the lowest round I've had on the Old Course from the 30-odd times I've played here. Hit the ball very nicely, didn't miss any fairways or greens today, and hold a couple of long putts.  
 Always fancy my chances on the links courses and like playing in the wind.  
 On The Race to Dubai: I'm right on the border line at the moment, a good week here could shoot me up the leader board for The Race to Dubai.
