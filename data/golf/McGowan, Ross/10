 Q. Good to get under par at under Carnoustie?
 ROSS McGOWAN: It is. I don't really know this course that well. So after 2-over through I think six start, I was happy to get it back.

 Q. A good run on the back nine there. 
 ROSS McGOWAN: Yeah, those holes started turning downwind. A couple of par 5s were easy to reach, birdied those and picked up a couple will and bogeyed 17 unfortunately. 

 Q. How tricky was that? 
 ROSS McGOWAN: Very tricky. It was very gusty, so I had a putt at the last there into the wind. It gusted up and came up a couple of foot short. But yes, it's definitely still tricky out there. 

 Q. Three shots off the lead going into tomorrow at the moment, how do you feel about your chances? 
 ROSS McGOWAN: I like it around St. Andrews. Shot 66 there on the first day, a bit of wind. I'm not sure what the forecast is like tomorrow but hopefully I'll hole a few putts early on and see how I get on.

 Q. You seem to have been in a bit of form the past few weeks. 
 ROSS McGOWAN: Yeah, finished third in Switzerland, I played nicely in Austria, just had a poor round on Saturday. I felt like we were playing well most of the summer really. Putter seems to have started working, and just keeps you going a bit when you're holing those sort of 6-, 8-, 10-footers to keep you going. 

 Q. Has that been the key to your week so far? 
 ROSS McGOWAN: I think so, the last three or four weeks, really, and holing out the odd 10-footer. When you can do that, you can post a good score.
