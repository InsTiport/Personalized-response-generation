   ROSS McGOWAN: No, wasn't the day I was looking for really. I thought having rested it for a few days, it would be okay today. But it still flared up, and I think my chances of winning here are pretty slim now. So hopefully we can concentrate on the rest of the year, and put some good performances in. 

 Q. And this is despite physio, despite injections, shoulder still causing problems? 
 ROSS McGOWAN: Yeah, I think we've tried pretty much everything other than injections. I don't really want to go there. I've already had one of those in my wrist this year. It's just a case of resting it, icing it, and hoping we can get it better soon. 

 Q. What are the chances to play tomorrow? Is there any point in playing?
 ROSS McGOWAN: Well, that's the thing. It's a difficult situation. I'm not one who likes to pull out of events. So hopefully I'll be okay tomorrow. But we'll see how it goes. 

 Q. Race to Dubai in mind, as opposed to Ryder Cup now?
 ROSS McGOWAN: Yes, definitely. I think I'm around the 70th mark, so I need to pick up a few spots to make The Race to Dubai, and hopefully fully fit, we can crack on.
