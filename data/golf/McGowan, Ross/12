   GORDON SIMPSON: Ross, great playing today, 65 and leader in the clubhouse at 14-under. That's probably worth a large Johnnie Walker tonight, or maybe tomorrow.   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Yeah, maybe tomorrow.   
 GORDON SIMPSON: Tell us the key moments today then.   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Just hit the ball nicely really. Hit a lot of fairways. Around here if you can do that, the second shots, third shots, aren't too tough. I just played solid and hit the ball fairly close to about ten foot most of the day and made a few putts.   
 GORDON SIMPSON: Looks like one of these tournaments that anyone has a chance of winning.   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: It's very balanced and you can make a lot of birdies out there, and several guys have proven it today.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like you're really on --  
 ROSS MCGOWAN: I think so. I've struggled in the Middle East a little bit, but came out with a bit of work at home and played in Malaysia last week and felt it improving every day, and same thing this week. I feel like I'm getting better each day.   
 GORDON SIMPSON: This is what you train for to be in this position.   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Yeah, it's where you want to be. A good round tomorrow, and see how it goes.   
  
  Q. A follow-up to that question, when is the sort of last time you got yourself in this position where you feel like you had a good chance to grab the trophy?   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: It's been two or three tournaments that I've been a couple of shots behind really. Portuguese Open a couple of years ago, I led after 36 and the Italian Open after the first round last year.   
 It's nice, you never know, might hold the lead at the end of today.   
 GORDON SIMPSON: It's the right sort of progression, isn't it.   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Yeah, gradually getting there. Next have to do it over 72 holes.  
  
  Q. How has the changed over the three days, have the greens picked up at all?  
 ROSS MCGOWAN: They are definitely quicker today but they are still very soft and you can really fly the ball right up to the hole, even with 4- or 5-irons.  
  
  Q. Anthony Kim was asked what the winning score would be and he said 20-under; would you concur?   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: There or thereabouts. See if anybody gets hot and the par 5s and what have you.   
  
  Q. How have you been dealing with the heat?  
 ROSS MCGOWAN: I've just been drinking a lot of water and staying in the shade when I can. I drank a lot of water the last few days.   
  
  Q. I was going to ask, have you played much golf in Australia?   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: I played here once before. I played in Melbourne at Huntingdale, I think it was, MasterCard, and struggled there, the first 27 holes, from what I remember, and made the cut on the number. I think I finished 11th in the end. Last 2 1/2 rounds, I played really nice.   
 GORDON SIMPSON: Have you sought any advice from your illustrious stablemates on how to deal with this sort of position?   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Not really. Sort of coming through the Amateur ranks, you learn to deal with this position I guess a lot more, and I was very successful there.   
 GORDON SIMPSON: You enjoyed it, have you?   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Yeah, that's why we play this game. If you didn't, you'd be in the wrong job really. Sort of thrive on being in contention and trying to win.   
 GORDON SIMPSON: Ross, it's going to be a very interesting day tomorrow. Well played today and good luck tomorrow.
