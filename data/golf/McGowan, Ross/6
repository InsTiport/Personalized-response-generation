  Q. How does it feel to be the world No. 2, and the No. 1 seed in this championship?  
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Feels pretty good. I would say I fancied my chances. I knew I had a good chance at the beginning of the day.   
 I had a shaking start, but played really nicely from about the fifth or sixth. It is nice to win and get through for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. You did fancy your chances. I had a chat with you yesterday. I said you think you can beat him, don't you? You obviously did.  
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Yes, he's been playing well. Of course, I quite like it. It suits my game. To hole a few putts, especially the one on 19. I could go all the way.  
  
  Q. Are you as calm as you look on the golf course?  
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Sometimes. It was quite exciting when that one dropped on 19. On the whole, I tend to stay level-headed and just one foot at a time.  
  
  Q. Ishikawa tomorrow, what do you know about him?  
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Not very much. I just got told he was the youngest player in the field. Other than that, a good player from Japan. Be interesting to play with him tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Not qualified to play in The Masters yet. If you go three or four rounds, you're probably going to get in a position. How big a goal is that?   
 ROSS MCGOWAN: That would be obviously a huge goal to achieve really at the beginning of the year. I would like to play better than him at least. Hopefully, Top 50 by the time the cut is made and play in The Masters.  
  
  Q. Wish you luck tomorrow then.  
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Thank you.
