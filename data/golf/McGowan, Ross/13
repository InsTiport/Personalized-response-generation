  MICHAEL GIBBONS: Ross, welcome, opening round of 66. Tell us about that to start. 
 ROSS McGOWAN: It was windy when I started, but 17 and 18, played in 2-under, and played the rest quite well. 
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: And you're not feeling well, as well.
 ROSS McGOWAN: No, I haven't been well. Stomach bug I think. 

 Q. All pars till the end on the back nine; what happened there?
 ROSS McGOWAN: I hit driver, 3-wood just left of the green. It was nice to get 3-under through there and shoot up the leaderboard quite quickly. 
 I birdied 17 and 18. They are very tricky. I was just looking for par there really. 
 And then 9, I had a good drive there, I was looking for a birdie but unfortunately I didn't.

 Q. When did the wind really start howling? 
 ROSS McGOWAN: I don't think it will today. It was quite windy the first thing this morning but it blew itself out there. It's very calm out there now. 
 Especially on the back nine, there's a bit of water on the course and 16, 17, so with the crosswind they are very tough holes.

 Q. You like playing down here?
 ROSS McGOWAN: Yeah, I like it down here. 

 Q. Do you think that 66 is going to keep you at the top of the leaderboard?
 ROSS McGOWAN: I doubt it, looking at the way the wind has died down. Of course, it will probably firm up for a bit, the guys will be having a lot of wedges into holes so I have a feeling 7- or 8-under will probably be leading by the end of the day. 

 Q. Pleased with your start this year?
 ROSS McGOWAN: Last year I got caught by the wind on Thursday morning and shot 82 last year, so I guess this evens it out a little more. 

 Q. No bogeys? 
 ROSS McGOWAN: No. I think I hit 17 greens. Tee-to-green, just keep it in play, and let the putter do the work. I'll take it. 
 It's nice to get off to a good start. It's been a few tournaments since I've had a good first round. It's nice to get one under the belt and hopefully carry it on for the rest of the week.
