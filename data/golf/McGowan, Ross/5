 Q. It was disappointing, but you've got to be proud of what you achieved this week?
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Yes, beating Steve in the first round. Today my intensity wasn't quite there as much. I had chances to win the match and couldn't really take him. 
 Disappointed, but he played well, as well.

 Q. Touch and go today?
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Yes, it was, and neither of us played great on the front nine. I dropped a few shots here and there. 
 And on the back nine I got going on 14 hole, good putt there, and 15 as well. Great putt on 16, thought I'd make birdie there. But one of those things, it's 18 holes, and it could go either way at the end of the day.

 Q. Learn anything about yourself this week?
 ROSS MCGOWAN: Yes, obviously it's my first time here, it's a course that suits my game. Hopefully I'll be back again next year, and looking to do better.

 Q. Occasions like this makes you want more, doesn't it?
 ROSS MCGOWAN: It does. It's a fantastic event and just looking down the leaderboard and looking at the guys that are going out first and second round, and lots have won Majors.
