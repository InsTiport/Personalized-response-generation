THE MODERATOR: Go ahead and get started here with Adam Svensson at the 2019 Sony Open in Hawaii.  Adam opened with a 61, the lowest opening score on the PGA TOUR since Brandt Snedeker's 59 at the Wyndham Championship.   
Adam, if we could just have an opening comment as you make your 12th career start on the PGA TOUR.   
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, I mean, obviously I'm honored to be in the Hawaii.  It's a great place.  Yeah, today just kind of was all a blur.  I don't really remember what holes I birdied and stuff.  It was kind of I was just flowing, yeah, just having a good time and enjoying it.   
THE MODERATOR: We'll take some questions out here.   
 Q.  A year ago you were in the Bahamas.  Now you're here.  (Indiscernible.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, I mean, Bahamas golf course is kind of similar to this.  Same grass?  Yeah, just happy I got off to a good start last year, and obviously this year see how it goes.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: 61 in college but that was my lowest.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, tied career best, yep.  I would say so, yeah.  Golf course is a little harder.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: 6-iron.  I actually thinned it.  I was hoping it would get over the bunker and it did and worked out.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, 11.  Pardon me?   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, missed a couple on the front and I was like, Just be patient.  I started rolling in 40, 45 footers, something like that, and I just kind of took it from there.  Had a lot of the confidence.  Was just feeling it today with the putter.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, my caddie and Jason and I kind of joked around about stuff off the golf course; just talked about other things.  Then once we're in the shot we focus and then hit it.   
 Q.  What's the main topic?  
ADAM SVENSSON: (Laughter.)  No comment.  No, it's not that.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, just kind of the same game plan.  It worked great today.  I feel like hit a lot of fairways.  I didn't hit driver on a lot of holes.  I kind of laid back a little bit here and there, and I also played aggressive.   
So just kind of depends on the wind and then just feel it out.  Obviously when it's windy there is not really a game plan.  You just go out there and play.  We'll see tomorrow.   
THE MODERATOR: Talk a little bit about what the Web.com Tour does to prepare people like you coming out here and making an impact this early in your career, strong opening like that.   
ADAM SVENSSON: I mean, it's huge.  The Web, for me it was the travel part, you know, obviously traveling to different countries and just getting to know what have to do each week.  Obviously winning on the Web.com Tour is extremely hard because you have go so low.  I think that mentality out on the PGA TOUR is the great thing to have.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: I was on Team Canada for six years.  Mack Hughes, you got Corey Connors.  You got a bunch of Canadians that have come up through there.   
Just the coaching and stuff, workout, nutrition, and obviously the swing coach, it's a great program.   
 Q.  (Regarding Barry University.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Barry, yeah, I had some issues with my -- I had some issues with my credit and stuff transferring and kind of all that stuff, so I ended up at Barry and went there for two years and was probably the best decision I ever made.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: I have not, no.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: I won the award but I couldn't go.  Yeah, it was.  Not sure.  It was like a wedding or something like that.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah.  I don't know.  They asked me what I bought when I won and I went to Costco and bought a Dyson, a $500 Dyson vacuum.  I don't know.  I thought it was pretty cool.  Cordless.  I don't know.   
 Q.  Pretty neat.  Do you use it?  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, it is.  Sometimes, yeah.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: You know, I probably played in six, five or six PGA TOUR events, a lot of Canadian Opens, one in Puerto Rico one year.  I really do think the Web has helped me a lot just with nerves and know how to play the game pretty much, how to get around, how to score, stuff like that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, three or four years old and my dad was teeing off and I guess I decided to drive the cart right into the lake.  I drove it into the lake, yeah.   
Well I drove it in -- my dad told me -- and then I hopped out and my dad was trying to grab his clubs and stuff like that, but it ended up sinking to the bottom.   
THE MODERATOR: Don't worry about the kid, right?  Just grab the clubs.   
ADAM SVENSSON: Oh, yeah.  He was worried about the clubs.  Yeah, I think he got a putter or something, a driver out of there, but that was it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, hopefully a Dyson.   
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Adam?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Par-3?  Hit 5-iron.  It was into off the left.  Tried to hit like a high one and I ended up to the right and, yeah, rolled that 40-footer; slider, yep.   
THE MODERATOR: All right, well I just wanted to say I appreciate you guys checking the accuracy of those PGA TOUR media guides.  It's good.  Glad we got the right information in there.   
One question over here.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: I feel like it did.  You know, I played one practice round on Tuesday and I felt like my strength is ball striking.  Off the tee you got to be in the fairway.  If you're not in the fairway you know 90% of the time it's going to be a flier.  So fairways are huge, and greens in regulation as well.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Just when you guys bring it up.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Yeah, I mean, Corey is an amazing player and he finished second the second tournament in this year.  It's always good to see Canadians up there on the leaderboard.  It almost makes you wants to practice harder and just work out and do all the right things to get better.   
 Q.  Been in Hawaii before?  
ADAM SVENSSON: First time.  First time.  It's like Florida with mountains, though.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
ADAM SVENSSON: Sponsor exemption, yep.   
THE MODERATOR: All right.  All set?  Great start here, Adam.  Best of luck keeping it up.   
ADAM SVENSSON: Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.
