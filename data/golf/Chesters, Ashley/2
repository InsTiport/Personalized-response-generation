 Q.  A 66, how was that today?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: It was pretty good.  Well, I started off okay and then got quite hot in the middle and just sort of hit a couple of iffy shots towards the end.  Overall, it was pretty good.   
 Q.  You had especially on the back nine for yourself, you had three birdies in a row.  What was the key to your birdies out there?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: The putting, really.  I hit decent shots in.  I got a bit lucky on the fourth, but I holed a couple of nice birdie putts.  Got lucky with a couple iron shots which led to two of my birdies, one on 14 and one on 4.  I got quite nice bounces, which you take it when you get them but I holed the putt, as well, so you've got to take advantage when you do get a bit of luck because you don't get it very often.   
 Q.  Off-target drive on your 16th but you managed to get a par on that one.  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: Yeah, it wasn't as far off-line as it quite looks, because it's hit a tree, gone right and come back yards.  Yeah, it quite what I was trying to hit but I hit quite a nice shot from there because I didn't have too much to go with.  I wasn't expecting to get on the green.  Thought if I could get it somewhere short left; but yeah, probably the best shot I've hit today in the end.   
 Q.  Weather wasn't as bad as it looked for you?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: I was quite happy.  I was expecting it to be raining from the second I woke up to be honest.  Yeah, I can't complain.  We didn't end up with it too bad at all.
