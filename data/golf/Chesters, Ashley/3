Q. You have led from the front all week and given a great performance to earn 3  Â½ points?
ASHLEY CHESTERS: ?Nige obviously put me there to get some points early and I have managed to do that for him. I have done it most of the year for England, I did it last year in the St Andrews Trophy for GB&I and I did it for Europe in the Bonallack Trophy so it is the same as that. I have got no problem going out first at all.?
Q. How does it feel to win the match?
ASHLEY CHESTERS: ?Yes we have won and it?s great to get the trophy back.
Q. You have obviously enjoyed playing for Nigel?
ASHLEY CHESTERS: ?Yes, he is a great Captain. He has a lot of passion and he is great to play for.?
