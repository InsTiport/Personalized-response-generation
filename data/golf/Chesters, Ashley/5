 Q.  Tell me about the match today. It seemed like the lead changed on every hole.  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: It was a really good game, there was all sorts going on really but I don?t think anyone was ever any more than 1up. I think a half is a pretty fair outcome in the end, neither of us really deserved to lose.   
 Q.  It was a very highly anticipated match, the first one out and two very highly ranked players. What did you think about playing Bryson today?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: Obviously he?s a great player so it was great to play against him and nice to play well against him as well.   
 Q.  It seemed like conditions were pretty tough with some wind out there, what did you think about the course?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: It?s pretty much what we?re used to. We get stronger winds than this round here and it?s usually raining with it as well, so it was quite a nice day really.   
 Q.  The crowds were phenomenal out here today, what was it like playing out there for you?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: I couldn?t believe how many people were out here, it was a lot more than I expected and they are pretty noisy as well so it was really nice.
