 Q.  How pleased are you to start with a win?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: It's always nice in the first game to get off to a win but there is still a long way to go.   
 Q.  What was the key in the match?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: They made a couple of mistakes on 9 and 10. Jimmy had hit probably five good iron shots in a row on the greens. If you hit the greens round here you put a bit of pressure on the others.   
We were up pretty much the whole way after we won the first. They got it back to all square a couple of times but we were never behind which is always good as well.   
 Q.  How much did you enjoy playing with Jimmy?  
ASHLEY CHESTERS: We just get on pretty well. He is a funny guy and we had a bit of a laugh out there.
