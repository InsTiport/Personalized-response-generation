Q. I see you got some practice rounds out here. How is it to play a tournament round out here at Augusta?
CHENG JIN: It's pretty different. Especially on that first tee. I was pretty excited.

Q. You had some nice holes today. Four birdies on the day. Look back at the good parts of your round. What were the highlights of it?
CHENG JIN: I birdied a few tough holes like 14, 10 and 5. 3's a birdieable hole. 
But I made a few, I had a few loose shots, so.

Q. Is there any part of your game you think you can do better at tomorrow?
CHENG JIN: I will try to hit more fairways and more greens for sure. But it's a little challenging with this wind. My driver wasn't that good, not only because I was nervous, but because I didn't notice that, on the first hole‑‑ after a few holes I began to notice that all my drives were going a little right today. 

Q. After playing in reasonable conditions in practice and then it was so windy today, was that a bit of a shock to you?
CHENG JIN: A little bit, but actually on Saturday during the registration day, it was pretty windy, too. So actually it was fine. 

Q. Are you really disappointed with your score or do you feel it wasn't too bad?
CHENG JIN: Not super disappointed, a little disappointed. But I tried my best and I enjoyed the whole 18 holes. It was an awesome experience. I enjoyed playing with Zach [Johnson] and Rickie [Fowler].
