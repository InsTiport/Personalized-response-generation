Q.   Justin has put himself in contention heading into the weekend.   How good was that number out there for you?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   It was good.   I really played well.   I missed some chances on my first, you know, two‑thirds of my round, first half of my round.   I just kept giving myself looks, which is hard to do out here sometimes, and I was hitting fairways and greens. 
I feel good about my game, I'm really playing well.   I'm really excited for the weekend.

Q.   We talked about this earlier in the week, but kind of verbalize the inspiration you now have seeing your good friend Jordan Spieth with the Green Jacket. 
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, it's pretty inspiring.   It's maybe not so‑‑ I mean, obviously it's fine for every event, but especially for Masters and the Futures and majors.   But obviously I was happy for him and it's definitely motivating for me to try to get to where he is and battle it out with him.

Q.   How fun has it been, since you guys are sharing the same house in the evenings?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   It's been good.   It's just been normal stuff.   I think he's been pretty tired.   Kind of taking it easy, playing some cards here and there.   We've got a hot tub, so we've just been hanging out.   We've got both our caddies and Michael's wife.   So it's been a good time.   It's been a nice, relaxing week.
