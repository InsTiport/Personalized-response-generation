JUSTIN THOMAS: (In progress.) Get anything out of those. Pretty easy to do out there. Two bad three-putts. I mean, two of probably the best shots I hit today on 2 and 11 the wind just kind of died down. Well, it didn't kind of die down, it did die down. Hit two 5-irons right where I was looking and they went over the green and bogeyed both of those holes.
So if I don't three-putt and just even one of those shots works out, if not both, and I have an under-par round, which would've been impressive today.
Q. How difficult were the conditions today?
JUSTIN THOMAS: They were really hard. Just unfortunately not exactly what you're looking for after a week like last week. Just trying to find something where it's easy to get in play and on the green. It was a grind, which was what last week was, so it was really hard to stay focused.
Felt like I didn't do a good job of that to start, but then played pretty well the last 13 or so holes.
Q. You talk about the gusts and how the wind died down. Are you trying to guess when it's going to gust and when it's going to die down?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, you have an idea. It's not really a day of hitting numbers. It's more hitting shots. I had 180, and, I mean, you got to think this is a good 25 to 40 yard wind, I just tried to flight a little 5-iron in there and kind of hold it against the wind. I mean, it was right over the pin.
You could tell it just never got up and stayed too low. So just stuff like that. When it's blowing like this it happens; you just hope it doesn't happen to you.
