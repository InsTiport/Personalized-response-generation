  Q. How different did the course play?
 JUSTIN THOMAS:   It's not even remotely close to the same.  I mean, you've still got to hit the shots, and I don't want to say it was a disadvantage, but it was a totally, totally different golf course.  The course is in fantastic shape right now.  It's very tough.
 Q. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at the scores other than the ones in your group, but are you surprised to see them much higher?
 JUSTIN THOMAS:   No.  I mean, I haven't looked it up, but I would assume that they're very high.  Obviously I had a pretty tough time with it.  It's tough.
