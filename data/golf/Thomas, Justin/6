Q. How would you describe your day?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   It was a weird day.  It was a lot of ups and downs.  I felt like I played good enough to shoot a pretty good number.  I hit just a really terrible drive on 6 that cost me.  I had some good breaks, had some bad breaks.  I didn't putt it as well today.  I definitely didn't hole much again, but it was, yeah, like I said, it was a weird, weird day.
Q. Even after a weird day, you're right in the mix here and right now about four back.  What's your mentality going out there tomorrow?  I mean, you know you got to go low.  You've won here before.  What's the mentality that you take into the final round tomorrow?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, I just need to, I need to play well.  It's hard when it's, the conditions are like this and it's, you hate to say as easy as it is, but when it's like this, you have to shoot 7- or 8-under to keep pace.  And I told Jimmy walking up 18, it's not very often you start the day tied second and you're 5-under through 17 and you've lost ground and loss position in a tournament.  So, but it is what it is.  I know what I'm doing within the golf course and I just have to go out and play better.
Q. Is there one thing you're going to focus on tomorrow to maybe be a little bit better than today to help you hopefully hold the trophy again.
JUSTIN THOMAS:   I mean, I would like to drive it a little bit better, but at the end of the day I have to hole more putts.  I can't possibly win this tournament holing as few putts as I have the first few days and hopefully I'll find something and do it.
Q. Jimmy, during Justin's third round today he missed a putt and unfortunately made a homophobic slur that our microphones picked up.  Justin is joining us now.  How would you explain what happened on the golf course today, Justin?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   It's inexcusable.  I, first off, I just apologize.  I mean, there's no excuse.  I'm an adult.  I'm a grown man, there's absolutely no reason for me to say anything like that.
It's terrible.  I mean, I'm extremely embarrassed, it's not who I am, it's not the kind of person that I am or anything that I do, but it's, unfortunately, I did it and I have to own up to it and I'm very apologetic.
Q. You learn a lot through adversity, I know it's not been a long time and you're still digesting this, but what do you think you're going to learn from today?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   A lot.  I mean it's, like I said, it's inexcusable, I mean, I'm speechless, there's nothing -- I -- I found out when I got done on the golf course or when I got done with my round.  I mean, it's, it's bad.  There's no other way to put it.
I need to do better, I need to be better, it's definitely a learning experience, but, yeah, I just, I deeply apologize to everybody and anybody who I offended and I'll be better because of it.
