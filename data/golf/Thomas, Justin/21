  JUSTIN THOMAS:   It's an unbelievable golf course.  It's for sure my favorite U.S. Open venue I've played.  I'm pretty disappointed in how I finished the week.  I hit it just terribly the second and third rounds.  I hit it nice today.  I played really, really good golf and hit a lot of good putts that just burned the edges, and it's a shame.  Those last two holes, I don't know, I just wasn't seeming to get those lies that I kept seeing people get in the rough.  I feel like every time I had one I struggled just to get to the green, but that's just the luck of the draw out here.  The rough is penal and you've got to get the ball in the fairway.
 Q. Talk about what you liked about this venue.
 JUSTIN THOMAS:   It's fair.  If you play well you can score and make birdies.  For the most part a lot of the pins are bowl pins, but if you don't, it's brutal.  I just think it's all right in front of you.  It was not overly firm, it was not overly fast.  The USGA did a great job setting it up for us this week.  Very easily they could have had 15 over par win this week if they wanted, and it was very fair and right in front of us.
 Q. What will the next couple months be like for you?
 JUSTIN THOMAS:   I don't know.  I mean, I want to break everything in sight right now, so golf is the last thing on my mind.  But I've just got a couple things to do and then just jump in again.
