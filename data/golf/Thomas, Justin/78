Q. A couple of birdies to finish off.  It's been a pretty good final day here for you.  Did you enjoy it?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's a great week as always.  I think this is about as opposite of weather as I was expecting for The Scottish Open, but it's nice to come over here and play well and had a good final round obviously.  There's plenty of things around the week I could have done better to have a chance to win but it was a good finish on the back nine.
Q. In terms of the golf course, the challenge, building up to The Open Championship, did you get what you wanted coming to the Scottish Open?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Obviously it wasn't much of a challenge.  You can look at the scores to tell you that, but it's just because of the weather.  When you get a links golf course soft without any wind and sunshine, there's going to be a lot of birdies, and that's what happened.  That's not a bad thing by any means.  I still came over here and played competitive golf and played well and at least as around the lead for a little bit.
It was nice to, like I said, just to play well and have a decent finish, because it's been a while.
Q. How do you feel your mindset is having played this week here, which is a first going into an Open Championship?  How do you feel you are mentally in terms of the game going in, in preparation, rather than not playing the week before?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I feel great.  I think my game's in a very good spot.  I've played plenty well enough to have a chance to win or win this golf tournament.  Just a couple things here and there, but that's what happens.  I just have three days to tighten them up and get some rest next week.  It's hard to say how it prepared me because I haven't played next week yet, but I feel good about my game at least.
Q. Strong finish from the 12th hole coming in, how pleased are you with the performance you've put in here in Scotland?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I'm very pleased.  I felt like it was very close to winning this tournament.  Obviously very, very mediocre day yesterday, but with these conditions, and this golf course being soft, you knew you had to go low.
I thought I did everything well enough to at least contend and put myself and have a decent finish like I did this week.  It's definitely nice to see some good things kind of pay off with the hard work we've been putting in.
Q. We love having you guys come over to play these tournaments.  From your point of view, the changes to links golf, part of it is about next week, as well.  What's the biggest thing you adapted to this week getting ready for next?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I think just playing.  Although it was very, very soft and no wind, you still had to somewhat play the run-outs and still try to avoid the bunkers.  That's the biggest thing.  There are plenty of courses we play on Tour where if you get long rough, you're hoping your ball gets in the bunker; whereas here, you're just praying it doesn't go in a bunker.
Just trying to get that mindset, and even a ten-mile-an-hour wind here, it's still strong.  It's amazing how much it moves the ball or affects it.  Getting accustomed to that, and time change and sleep, obviously haven't played next week and don't know how it's going to be, but I feel so far, it's been beneficial.
Q. Give us a sense of the difference in vibe when you come over and play a major on our soil.
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's different but it's a good different.  It's so much fun.  I'm very excited to see the Irish fans next week.  I'm sure they are going to be, I mean, just thousands and thousands of them.  I'm sure next week would be a rough week to be playing with Rory but for a good reason.  It's going to be great.  I've heard a lot of great things.
I've played one event in Ireland, the Palmer Cup in Ireland when I was in college, and it was very fun, at Royal County Down.  I'm excited to see Portrush and see what it's all about.  Any time you play an Open Championship, you know the fans are going to be great and you know the atmosphere is going to be great, and you just hope you're walking up that 18th hole late on Sunday night with some great cheers.
