  JUSTIN THOMAS: We could kind of hear it on probably like 4 or 5 because we didn't know what was going on.  We thought someone may have made another one, but I started to hear they were chanting "hole-in-one," so that was pretty funny.   Q.  What did you hit?  JUSTIN THOMAS: I hit pitching wedge.   Q.  When it's flying through the air does it look good?  JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it looked really good the whole way.  As soon as it landed I said, "go in."  I mean, yeah, I really felt good about the shot before I hit it.  I felt like it was a good number, and with the rain it could bring it in from behind the hole, too, and it would have a good chance.   Q.  Did you know there was one already?  JUSTIN THOMAS: I did, yeah.   Q.  So you knew everyone was getting more money for yours?  JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah.  Well, I wasn't exactly thinking that over the shot, but after I made it and kind of got through celebrating, I was like, yeah, everyone here is going to get 500 bucks because you could see everyone was going crazy.  It's all the more reason for them to get excited than just to see an ace.   Q.  Anybody offer to buy you dinner or a drink or anything yet?  JUSTIN THOMAS: No, I just got done, so no, nothing yet.   Q.  How about a 67 for the afternoon session?  A lot of them were in the morning and you get out with 67.  You mentioned a couple may have gotten away.  JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I thought it played -- I obviously didn't play this morning, but I thought it played harder this afternoon.  It doesn't matter if it's softer.  When it's raining it's a little more difficult I would say.  The rough, it doesn't come out the same, it gets a little thick and doesn't go as far.  But yeah, after my start, I definitely would have taken 3-under through four holes, through five holes.  But yeah, it was unfortunate I definitely let a good amount of strokes good, but I'm in good position to just keep moving on.   Q.  Going back to the hole-in-one, would you like to see that hole every week, give out money to fans, people having fun with it?  JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I guess there's not too many places that you can get in the position to do what Mr. Justice is doing, and it's really cool that he does that.  Here we go, more hole-in-one chants.  But it just gives everyone more reason to come here and watch.  Yeah, it is cool, but not each tournament, each person can do that.
