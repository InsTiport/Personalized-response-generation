Q. Tied the course record here, 7-under 65.  If we can get some comments on your play.
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was a good day.  Obviously any time you shoot 65, especially to open a golf tournament, it's great.  I mean, I probably would say that I had the worst warmup I've ever had in my life this morning.  I didn't know what it was going to do.  I didn't know how I was going to hit it, and my dad and Jimmy and I just kind of said that we were going to have to guess out there and just try to find something.  I've had that happen plenty of times, just not quite that extreme.  I'm usually pretty good at finding my way around a golf course and finding something, but definitely didn't expect that today.
Q. Would you describe it as an easy day out there?  What made you use those words?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Just because I drove it pretty well, and the course is so soft that as long as you leave it in the right places if you miss the green, it's not very difficult to get up-and-down, and the greens are really good.  Obviously all my birdies, I made a long one there on 16 and made a nice one on 15 from 14, 15 feet, but it was uphill, and all my birdie putts were easy putts.  So I was able to hit my wedges close or chip it close or whatever it was, and it just felt like it was a very low-stress day.
Q. What did you hit on 4?
JUSTIN THOMAS: 5-iron.  Yeah, I'm sure he came back -- we had 208, figured it was playing about 215, and then again, it was so early in the round that I literally was just trying to hit the green.  I was just like, don't make a bogey here, let's just hit it on the green and we have some holes coming up, and hit it to a foot, so that was nice.
Q. Did you hit that tree in a practice round, too?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I did.  If it stays in the fairway, whatever.  I'll take three 4s the rest of the week on that hole.
Q. When it's soft, is there any defense?
JUSTIN THOMAS: The wind.  I mean, the rough is brutal still.  If you hit it in the rough, it's really hard to hit the green.  I hit it in the rough a couple times today, and I definitely couldn't get it close, but I felt like it was hard to hit the green.  So that's for sure a defense.  But the fairways are being so soft makes them a lot bigger.  A lot of guys out here drive the ball pretty well, so it's harder to miss the fairways.
Q. When did you find the game?  What did you feel you knew what was going on?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Kind of that early -- I hit a really good -- I started out pretty nice.  I hit a good tee shot on 3, a good wedge shot on 4, though on 3 it wasn't even close, and then obviously hit a great 5-iron in there on 4 and then played 5 well.  So I felt like I just was more so trying to hit shots as opposed to have a golf swing thought.  Like all right, I've got to take it inside and then open it up and kind of cover it but keep it shallow, all this stuff.  I'm like, I just need to try to hit the yardages today, try to hit numbers, and just see what I can get out of it.
Q. What was the closest you were to a bogey?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Probably No. 11.  I hit -- it wasn't a bad 3-wood but definitely wasn't a great one, just went through the fairway in the rough and missed the -- had a hard time hitting the green, missed it in the left bunker, pin kind of rolled to the downslope, hit a pretty good bunker shot to about nine feet and made it.
Q. How would you describe this season for you, coming off a three-win season for you last year?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's weird.  Yeah, I mean, it's been an odd season just because I've missed three tournaments.  But the difference with this season and any other season is I'd won.
Q. The game is still there, though?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I'm playing every bit as good as I have any other year this year for sure.
Q. You talked about when you found your game; when did you lose it?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I had probably the worst warmup I've ever had in my life this morning.  I couldn't hit the ball.  I had no idea what I was doing.
Q. Will you be like Dustin and not warm up tomorrow?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I'm going to probably warm up.  (Laughter.)
