Q. Third win on the PGA TOUR, but the first with mommy and daddy on the premises.  How does that feel?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It feels great.  I actually thought of that yesterday.  I know my mom, I know she's going to be crying pretty good.  I was actually surprised she held it together.  I tried to make it tough on them.  Yeah, it's great to have them here.
Q. There was so many good shots, but the second into 17, that was really something.
JUSTIN THOMAS: I felt really comfortable, even those bad shots I hit, the tee shot on 14 or the second shot on 15, I didn't feel bad or nervy or anything over them.  I think I just tried to do too much or didn't take my time enough.
I felt good out there.  I told myself, there's no reason to lose concentration or confidence just because of a couple swings, and that one on 17 was awesome.
Q. It's hard to process so quickly after the fact but now third win, short space of time, you must feel like you belong on the PGA TOUR?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, that's why I left school early and that's why I turned pro when I did.  I came out here to win and I felt like I was ready to.  These last couple tournaments, to get a couple done, it's always great.
But get a night to celebrate it and then we're on to next week.
