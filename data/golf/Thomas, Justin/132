Q. Justin, a little slow coming out of the blocks, but you really rebounded well especially in the middle of the first round here at the Travelers Championship?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, that's the thing about this course, you can get pretty hot on it pretty quickly.  I was just in a weird mood today.  I couldn't really get into it.  I slept for a while last night, and I kind of had a hard time getting out of that grogginess.  I told Jimmy to start, I'm like, yeah, I need something to happen today to get this round going because I'm having a hard time getting into it.  So I'm very, very pleased to get a 4-under out of a round today.
Q. So, based on that, is the grogginess gone now with the 66?  You're right there, and you hung tough with Rory all day?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, definitely didn't finish very well by any means.  Could have easily shot 7- or 8-under today.  But 4-under isn't going to get me in trouble in the first round of a tournament.  I'll be able to go out tomorrow morning on hopefully a calm morning and some good conditions.
Q. How perfect were those conditions today out there on this TPC River Highlands layout?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it's great.  The greens are probably better than I've ever seen them.  They definitely are better than I've ever seen them.  If the weather stays like this, they're going to get it exactly where they want it in terms of firmness and fast.  It's probably going to produce yet again another great tournament.
Q. Can you walk through what happened with the interaction with Jimmy after the bunker shot there on 6?  The way he pulled the putter out.
JUSTIN THOMAS: Oh, yeah.  I don't know why he did that.  Yeah, he just I think out of instinct went to give me the putter and I told him I didn't need that, so put it back in the bag.
Q. Did you know right before you hit your bunker shot there that --
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, we saw it.
Q. Did you learn from it?
JUSTIN THOMAS: No, because I was about 260 yards away, so you can't really learn a whole lot from that far away.
Q. Can you talk about your round today and how you feel you were sinking your putts?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was nice to play low on a Thursday.  It felt like it's been a little while since I've done that.  I don't know.  I was kind of in a weird state to start the day.  I couldn't get into it.  I was having a hard time, not getting motivated, but just getting focused, I should say.  Some sloppy, sloppy bogeys and some swings and mistakes there early in the round.  I just was having a hard time really getting into the round.
Then that eagle on 6 kind of helped me out a little bit.  I putted the ball beautifully today, besides one really stupid short miss.  But, yeah, it could have been lower, but pleased with 4-under.
