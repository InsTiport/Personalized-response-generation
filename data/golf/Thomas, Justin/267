Q. Thoughts on how everything went down today?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, just really upset and disappointed to be honest.  Yeah, it's unfortunate.  I mean, I really, really fought hard those last five, six holes and had some great chances, made two really good birdies, and unfortunate miss on 16, but a great par save on 17, and then 18.  But that's just part of it.  Got to play better.
Q. How aware were you throughout the round of the projection?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I was pretty aware, but not -- I was trying not to watch it religiously, I was just trying to go about my business.  But when it's right there in front of you it's pretty hard to miss with all the boards and everything, but I just tried to block that out as much as I could.
Q. What did you have for the second shot there on 18?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I had 259 hole, 242 front, just a cut 3-wood, just a little on the downslope, and I just chunked it.
