Q. Update of where you are health-wise?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I feel fine in terms of the sinus stuff, which is great.  Stomach still isn't great, but I mean, just don't have a lot of energy, or I didn't today.  I'm fine.  I'm not as bad as I'm sure some people might think.  But hopefully it will just keep improving.
Q. Was it something that affected you in MÃ©xico or something that you started to feel?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was weird, I was fine in MÃ©xico.  A lot of people got sick or weren't feeling well but I was great.  I don't know what it was, whether it was the change in altitude or something I ate before I left, but things haven't been settling well the last couple days.  It's at least trending the right direction, just very, very slowly.
I think another hopefully another night's sleep and I'll be fine.
Q. Does the house you're in have a doctor's office?  Seems to have everything else?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I wish it did.  I'm sure if I worked hard enough, I might be able to get one over there.
Q. How much of an effect is that fatigue-wise on your round today?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I don't think it was too much.  I just think the fact, I hit a lot of good putts that just didn't go in.  Some of the short ones I missed, I really felt like I stroked them.  I just didn't read them right.  Just a couple those go in, I'm 2- or 3-under.  But I try to save my energy.  I walked really, really slow out there and was trying to drink a lot of water and just trying to stay hydrated.
