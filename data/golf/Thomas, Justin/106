Q. How much of a heavyweight battle was that?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was a heavyweight pillow fight, if you will.  We both -- it was weird, we didn't get off to great starts, I certainly didn't, but we really both took quality swings on the back nine, and hit some unbelievable putts, just couldn't get the ball to go in the hole.  It wasn't a very fitting end for the match, I really feel badly about that, but that was a good point for us.
Q. Were you surprised to see Rory hit 3-wood off 18?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not at all.  If I hit it over, I would probably hit 3-wood.  I guess I had a little more adrenaline than I thought and the ball was going a little farther, and it ended up right where it needed to be.  You have to stay short of that water and get in the fairway, is the most important thing, especially after my drive.
Q. What was the main order, you going out first?  What was your job?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Get a point.  That's what I did.
Q. How many drivers did you hit today?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Four.
Q. Was that more than you would have?  Were you being more aggressive in singles?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was a different wind today.  It was kind of north and northeast the first two days, and then today, it was north and it ended up, it's northwest right now.  This hole has been kind of like this the first two days and now it's kind of in off the left.  It's a different wind, but everyone is going to hit driver on this hole and 17 and 14, so those were three drivers, and then 7, as well, so just kind of how it played out.
Q. Is there a little bit of comfort, wearing your own clothes, in a manner of speaking?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not really.  I guess a little bit --
Q. You look like yourself?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Well, I guess that's true.  I never really thought of it.  I was definitely comfortable and glad to be a part of it.
Q. What was the highlight of your first time?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Just all the stuff in the team room and hanging out with the guys.  There's a lot of guys that I know very well and all the teammates, but I think until you spend that quality time together, until you have those dinners and everybody is sharing stories of the different Ryder Cups, it's just I cannot play to play in more of these and I cannot wait to play in one in the States.
