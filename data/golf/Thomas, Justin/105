Q. Justin, well played.  Kind unfortunate end to the match, but we know what you've achieved in your career.  First Ryder Cup.  How big a moment does this one feel?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was an extremely unfitting way for that match to end.  I'm very happy to get the point for our team, but I didn't want to get it like I that.  I'm sure it helps a little bit I hit a great drive.  I told Rory I've looked up to him for a long time, and I've always respected the way he's treated me, so it was pretty cool getting thrown out there in the first match and playing against him.
Q. Leading Team USA and the motivation for everybody to get back into this and turn this thing around?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I would have liked to had a little bit more red up there.  I think, other than the first hole, it was the first time I led the match.  But hopefully they'll look up there and see I got that point.  You can feel it out here, just the American roars are a lot different than that American roars, for a good reason, and I'm hoping to hear some more.
