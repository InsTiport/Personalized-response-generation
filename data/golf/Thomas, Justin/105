JUSTIN THOMAS: It was one of the most bizarre, crazy -- it was insane.  I didn't think I had on a great chance to start the day or knew I needed to do something special, and the weather got pretty tough out there and I can't believe if I would have shot 2-under, I would have been in a playoff.  And, yeah, I mean for myself I just didn't, I couldn't make the putts.  I was putting well.  I just wasn't reading them properly and I'm really happy for Rick.  I told him in the scoring tent, I think that he's going to get a lot more out of something like that, showing resilience and coming back like that as opposed to going out there and winning by four or five.   
 Q.  How weird was it, not just him on the back nine, but the whole group on the back nine?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it wasn't as much -- I just was getting, it was funny because I had, hit into bunker three times and I had gotten three of just the most awful lies and really bad breaks.  And then Rick and I were kind of talking about it and saying how I kind of had got screwed.  And then after that on 11 I was like, well, I don't think I got so screwed anymore compared to that.  So it just, yeah, it was I mean I've never been in a group that had worse momentum.  I have never seen that happen.  It was Rickie's week.  It's Rickie's day and we're happy for him.
