Q. What do you feel like was missing here this week?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Just didn't execute. I mean, it's really, really tough out there.
But I played fine. I played plenty good enough to be at 4- or 5-under and right in contention.
I missed about every putt. I think honestly playing in course as often as I have in the past hurt me this year because it's just so weird the greens being as soft as they are, especially out of the rough when the ball flies as much as it does. So much topspin and it's still coming back, so sometimes you have to get adjusted to that. But everybody has to; it's not just me.
Yeah, just was a rough couple days.
Q. Any concern about your game?
JUSTIN THOMAS: No, none at all. I'm playing great. Playing plenty good enough to still be winning this week. Probably was a little exhausted from last week, which is good thing. No, I mean, played like crap so I deserve to have a weekend off.
