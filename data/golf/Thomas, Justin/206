JUSTIN THOMAS: It feels good.  It's nice to have people stop talking about that.  It was something that wasn't meant to be.  Obviously knew it was going to get a lot of publicity and be out there.  But I didn't come here to dress well.  I came here to try to play some good golf.  And I guess that just happened.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I mean it was real steady.  I just hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  Had some good 2-putts and good saves.  All my pars were pretty low stress.  I had a good up-and-down after a bad 9-iron into 5.  And then had a bad chip on 6.  But made a good putt and made bogey there.  That lip out of 14, that was absurd.  So that's obviously a shot that could have been better, but I got a couple fortunate breaks.  And just overall pleased with how low stress it was for how hard it was.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not at all.  I got here Sunday morning instead of Monday, and used that extra day to get rest.  I don't sleep that good already; I'm waking up at six or seven.  I woke up at 2 and couldn't go back to sleep I think on Tuesday or something.  But just a lot of waking up throughout the night, which is not an awful thing when you have a morning tee time.  Tomorrow at 3:00 I'm going to have a lot of time to do nothing.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: We did at the Walker Cup as a team.  And I played in it.  And I know -- this is a golf shirt, so it's not like it's uncomfortable.  And obviously it's not tight.  It's something that I don't really even know I have on in terms of comfort-wise.  And it was just something I wanted to do for this match.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Saturday, for sure.  I mean I can think of 63 shots that come to mind before Sunday.  Yeah, Sunday is definitely not something I'm taking from that week.  I'm taking the experience of Sunday and the fact that I was there to start the day on Sunday.  But Saturday is where -- it was just too great of a day.  And I guess historic of a day for me to just kind of let it all go.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was gone Sunday morning.  As soon as the round is over with, it's done, whether you win or lose.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I literally hadn't thought about it at all since -- I had two tournaments the two weeks after.  So the only time I really think about it is an occasional thought where you're sitting there by yourself.  But I hadn't thought about it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I told Rosie, all these Justins that we're hear today, I'm going to take those for me.  I played with him before in my rookie year.  And someone who already has a fan base himself.  There was a lot of good Justins out there, and I'm going to claim maybe a third of them.   
The crowds here are so awesome.  Like a perfect example is that shot on 18, hitting a 7-iron to 40 feet.  You know you're not getting applause for that in the States.  And that was great they appreciate the shot.  And hitting the green was a good shot.   
I love the crowds over here.  I love playing over here.  There's nothing but good things about the outfit.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: No, just today.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Save it.  I can wear it will all if I wanted to, but probably won't break it out.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not very often.  I wore one every day in high school.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: No, it was hard.  I mean, it's getting warmer and the wind seems to be dying down.  It was tough this morning.  It was cold.  The ball was going nowhere.  It was very, very windy, into the wind, hitting some pretty crazy clubs from distances.  And it was only a good 15, 20-mile-an-hour wind, but when it gets a little bit cold or a little bit out of the north to start the day.  It was still tough.   
Those greens, if you do miss the green, you have a lot better chance to get up and down.  And those times where it rolls through the fairway, it's going to stay in the fairway.  I think that makes a huge difference where Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday it was getting really crispy out there.  It's still difficult.  I felt I played unbelievable, I'm sure Jordan did, too.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I mean I feel like they're all similar.  Maybe I just haven't played enough.  But the fact that you're trying to avoid the bunkers off the tees, and just get it in the fairway and then take advantage of opportunities when you have it.  Hit it low, I feel like you do that on all the links courses.  I might be crazy saying that.  My round at Troon was in such ridiculous conditions, Friday was in the sideways rain and blowing 30.  And Saturday and Sunday it was blowing a lot, too.  So you don't get a true, I guess, understanding or grasp of what the course is or what it feels like because you get different wind directions, it gets tough.
