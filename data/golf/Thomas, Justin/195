Q. You were talking about being comfortable today.  How much did that come from Erin Hills and what you learned there, and how much is that just the state of your game and how you felt?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I think it's both.  It's not like -- the thing about Erin Hills is really after five holes, I wasn't out of the tournament.  But I mean, I was seven or so back.  I was in contention in the final group for a good finish.  It wasn't very realistic for me to have a great chance to win that tournament.  Just the experience of going through it, any time you can be in the final group is great but it just was really my comfortability of where my game was and how I felt, and the prep that I put into this week; I felt like I was ready.  It just was about going out and doing it.
Q. What was the most important thing you did today?
JUSTIN THOMAS: The putt on 1 was pretty big.  Starting with a double there would have been pretty terrible.  I just absolutely murdered that drive.  It was like 350 to that bunker and somehow got in it.  That was the adrenaline and the heat there.  That ball was going in.
That just would have been such a bad double to start the day.  But even if I did -- just stayed patient and knew scores were not going to be crazy low.  And that chip-in on 13 was huge.
Q. And with the family ties, has to be terrific?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It is, and to have dad here, and let alone a PGA, but to have him here, and my mom and my girlfriend, it's great.  It really is.
