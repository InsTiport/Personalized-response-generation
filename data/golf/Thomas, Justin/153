Q. Another big win out there, just like the one yesterday, what's the secret to the performance?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I just played really well again.  I made some good putts, a lot of those short to mid-range putts.  It wasn't anything crazy or special.  Just played solid golf tee to green.  And it was forcing him to make a lot of putts.
Q. Is there a feeling that the quality of your golf is trending upwards throughout this week?
JUSTIN THOMAS: For sure.  It definitely got better from Wednesday, and has also gotten better since Monday.  But there's a lot of great opponents left and a lot of golf left, so I just have to continue playing well.
Q. With so much golf to play over the weekend, how good is it to wrap up these early matches?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's great.  Got to go in, grab some lunch and get some rest and see who I'm going to play.
Q. Two days in a row you won your matches here at 13, trying to save some energy?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it definitely bodes well for the afternoon and the rest of the week.
Q. You had a stretch I think it was 9, a lot of putts in a row.  Has that been a key that your short game is the key this week?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I made a putt on 3, made a good par-putt there on 7, and all the other ones were pretty short.  A lot of them were kind of that five to eight to ten foot range, but you still have to make them.  And I was very fortunate to do so.
