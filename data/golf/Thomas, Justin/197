 Q.  Justin, what a clean card.  You've had one bogey the entire week.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was a low-stress day, I guess you could say, other than that par on 14.  But yeah, again, I don't have my best stuff.  So I'm really, really pleased to keep the scorecard as clean as I have, and I just would like to be able to hit some shots and get some putts to fall to feel like I've made anything.   
 Q.  Looking at your putting stats, you didn't make that 22 footer on 14 but you had 96 feet in putts.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I did?  Oh, wow.  I guess I made that long one.  I guess I made a lot of solid-length putts -- not a lot, but I made a couple putts that added up to 40 or so feet.  Like the one on 18 -- but the greens are a little bit bumpy later in the day like this but I feel like I'm stroking it better than I have.  Just got to see the lines a little bit better.
