Q. Can you just explain what happened on 13 with Jimmy and your dad?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, Jimmy just wasn't feeling well.  He was feeling dizzy.  I mean, I can tell he was light-headed and just didn't have a lot of energy.  I mean, I told him on 12 that if he needed to leave, he needed to leave.  Just to make sure that he's okay versus both of us worrying about it out there, and I hit my tee shot and I came out and Jimmy was gone and my dad was there.
Q. What's that adjustment like?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   The adjustment was fine.  It was just -- I mean, yeah, it sucks because I really was playing well.  The course is very difficult, and I just -- yeah, just made a bad double and had a rough finish.  But I mean, it was fine.  I didn't make those bogeys because my dad was caddying, it was just poor execution.  But yeah, I mean, in a couple weeks or one day, nobody will remember it.  But right now, yeah, it's a bummer.
Q. Can you describe the difficulty of the golf course today?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, it's very tough.  It's very fair.  It rewards good shots and exposes bad ones.  You need to control your ball, which I felt like I was for the most part today, and just can't make any stupid mistakes.  Last week where you could short-side yourself and get away with it, yeah, that's not the case this week.  Some of these greens, 16 especially, is absurd.  It's like hitting into concrete.  You really, really have to be landing it pretty much exactly where you want, otherwise it's going to go to a bad place.
Q. Did it feel like a major out there?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, it did.  It was fun.  Especially with what's going on, we haven't played a major in a while, so this was as close as I thought -- I actually thought that on 18 kind of reading my putt and obviously with no people here it doesn't feel like a major in that sense, but just the golf course is so perfect, it's fun.  Haven't played a course like this in a while where the ball is rolling this much and the greens are this firm.
Q. How hot was it out there?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   It's not that hot.  I mean, it's Columbus, Ohio, in July.  It's not even close to as hot as it could be.
Q. Is Jimmy okay?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   I have no idea.  I haven't talked to him.  I literally hit my tee shot and I came out and he was gone.
