 Q.  Justin, what a finish.  The one thing I got to ask you about, on 14, when you made the double bogey, how were you able to regroup from that potential disaster?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: The thing I told myself is, I really didn't do it because I was nervous.  I felt like I've been struggling off those downhill lies and that's what I've been doing, I have been chunking.  Unfortunately, I had a big body of water in front of the green.   
But I just kept telling myself I controlled the tournament before that shot, so I just need to get back in it.  I had four more holes to try to make some more birdies and was fortunate enough to do it.   
 Q.  Talk about the burden of expectation and how hard this has been to get your first win knowing all the expectations that the media and everybody else has put on you?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's a lot harder when you run 20 footers about five feet past the hole.  It's tough, but I just kept telling myself that it's tough to win.   
Look at guys like Ricky, I mean, he's done pretty well for himself and it took him awhile to win, too.  I understand that we're in a sport where your winning percentage isn't in your favor, and I put myself there a bunch, and I just need to keep doing so and when moments like this can happen.   
 Q.  This is the first of many.  Thanks a lot.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Thanks.  Appreciate it.
