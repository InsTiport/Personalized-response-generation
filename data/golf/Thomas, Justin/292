  JOHN BUSH:   We'd like to welcome Justin Thomas to the media center at the Frys.com Open.   Just a few opening comments. 
JUSTIN THOMAS:   I'm just very excited to be here.   Obviously none of this would be possible without Mr.Sanchez and Mr.Butler giving me the opportunity, so I'm very excited for that.   It's wonderful weather and it's a wonderful golf course, so I'm just looking forward to getting the week started.
JOHN BUSH:   Just recently turned professional after the Walker Cup.   Maybe reflect back on what was a stellar amateur career capped off with a National Championship at University of Alabama and just talk about that. 
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, it was unbelievable.   It really went by fast.   I think that's something that really‑‑ you know, it's about as truer words as they can come.   After going through it, it just flies by.   But to have the final year that I did, to be a part of the teams that I was was just remarkable.   To win a National Championship with the guys at Alabama and for Coach Seawell, that was just an unbelievable way I felt to go out in my college career.   And the Walker Cup, to play with those guys and represent the United States of America and to play at such a historic venue at National Golf Links, it really doesn't get any better.   That's just kind of what I felt.   It was great. 
JOHN BUSH:   Not too bad of a rookie year for Jordan Spieth.   I know he's a good friend of yours.   Talk about your expectations and what you're hoping to achieve this year. 
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, it's been unbelievable watching him.   It gives people like me a lot of confidence going into a year.   But I'm not trying to have too many certain expectations.   I just want to come into all my events and just play the best that I can and most importantly just have a place to play this year.   I have Q‑school coming up, and obviously if I play well in the events I get into, it may not matter.   But at the same time I'm just going to try to take a learning experience from every day and just play the best that I can every day, and hopefully that results in me being in contention every week. 

Q.   What is it like to even start earning points to kind of keep your card instead of kind of rushing to do what Bud did, that you've got nine months or more than a year to pursue a card? 
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, it's a little different.   It's obviously something I've never really had to go through, but I feel like that's just kind of something‑‑ it's the same thing as trying to make a team or anything like that.   I feel like once you start kind of looking at it as I've got to get points for this or I've got to do something for that, at least for me personally when I get in trouble.   That's the same thing as Jordan, he was kind of going in free‑wheeling every week and he was playing well, and those points just kept accumulating.   Obviously that's an ideal situation for me, but I just want to play well, and if that stuff kind of ends up adding up, that would be great.

Q.   What is your schedule for the rest of the year that you know of?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   I have Q‑school the week after this and then the McGladrey and then Q‑schools after that.   That's it for this fall. 
JOHN BUSH:   Talk a little bit about the strength of your game and what people can expect. 
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Well, I don't know.   It's kind of a hard question to answer.   I feel like I'm a good ball striker, and when my putter gets hot or just when I putt well, I feel like that's when I contend.   But I think for me personally I just really just kind of enjoy being in the moment, and I really like getting in contention in tournaments, and I just kind of feel like I like thriving off of that.   It's a situation that's just really fun to be in, and I've been very fortunate to be in it with teams and stuff like that at Alabama and other things.   I just think kind of my competitive nature to play well helps me. 

Q.   And have you seen the golf course?   Have you been out there? 
JUSTIN THOMAS:   I have, yes. 

Q.   Thoughts on this golf course?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, it's wonderful.   It's perfect condition.   You know, it's firm but it's not too firm, and the greens are perfect.   They have a good firmness to them and they're not soft, so you've just got to‑‑ it seems like you've just got to control your distances and know your numbers and where you're hitting it out there.   But yeah, I never played here, and it's exceeded my expectations.   It's a great track.   I'm looking forward to playing it. 

Q.   You played a handful of TOUR events as an amateur.   Does this feel any different?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Not so far.   It's still an event.   As clichÃ© as that is, it's just another event.   But in reality it is, it's just‑‑ hopefully at the end of the week I'll be getting money for how I'm playing instead of just, "good job." 

Q.   Who's caddying for you?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   I have a guy Sam Pinfold that's caddying for me.   He just kind of went through a bunch of guys and he was recommended by a bunch of guys, and he's a great guy.   The thing for me is I've got to start from scratch somewhere, so he's caddying for me this week. 
JOHN BUSH:   Justin, thank you for your team.   Play well this week.
