 Q. J.T., an exciting day for all of us who were watching.  I know you're disappointed.  Can you talk about how it ended here?
 JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty pissed off.  That's about the only way to explain it.  I had a three-shot lead with three to go and just completely handed it over.  Collin played great.  He birdied a very tough hole on 17.  Both made great birdies on the first playoff hole.  But I had two chances, many chances to win this thing, but two chances in regulation and the second playoff hole and didn't get it done.
 Q. Can you draw any positives after a finish like this?
 JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, absolutely.  I made four bogeys on a very easy day today and still managed to be in a playoff.  The thing that sucks about golf is it hurts, but the great thing is that I have another chance next week.
 Q. I know you're working hard on your putting and I thought that was a real positive this week.
 JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, I mean, everything was a positive.  I shot 19-under par on a pretty tough golf course.  But the fact of the matter is I just completely gave it up, so that's just going to hurt for a while.
