Q. Up and down day for you.  You were hitting great shots and recovering, grinding out there, at least that was from our perspective.  How was it from your perspective?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was like that.  I felt like I had a great chance to win this tournament.  If I just make those putts, those putts on 13, 14.
13 is really an easy push, I just pushed it.
14 is a tough putt.
And on 15, I'm struggling to make par.
I fought really hard this week.  I was really proud of how patient I was.  And I gave myself a chance because of my mental game.  But to only finish four off the lead is a bummer, but I'm really happy for Duf.
Q. You like to dissect why mistakes happen.  If you could give an answer to that, what would it be?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I'm not really sure.  I really, really made some great putts.  I felt great over my putter.  I felt great over the golf ball.  I struck it beautifully, I thought.  I missed a couple of putts that I needed to make, but it wasn't from -- I felt like it wasn't from bad strokes.
A couple definitely were, the one on 13.  But when you get greens this fast -- on 14, I had a six-footer, playing a cup and a half out, you have to match up that speed and line perfect.  And it's tough to read.
I was comfortable.  It was nice to be back in the mix again, especially at a place like here.  And I'm just excited to be showing a little better form.
