Q. Talk about the round and how pleased you are with it and was there any one thing you may have worked on overnight?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I definitely worked on driving after I played yesterday, just trying to get it in the fairway, playing the par-3s better.  I did both today so that was nice.  I capitalized even before the delay.  I didn't play very well after I came out when it was really soft.  That was a bummer.  I had some great par saves when I came out and then the last three holes.  So to finish with 5-under is great.  Got myself back in the tournament.
Q. Just comment on how much better it feels.  Obviously the second round of the British Open, you missed out.  How does it feel to not only be in a weekend but be in contention?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's not any comparison in terms of that.  That's over with and long forgotten.  I was focused on trying to play well and get in contention this week.  Obviously yesterday didn't go how I wanted it to.  I finished well with a birdie on 9 to give me some momentum going into today.  It's just a really hard golf course is the only way to put it.  You have to make a lot of pars and sprinkle some birdies in.
Q. What are you expecting tomorrow?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I don't know.  It all depends how the PGA wants to set it up, if we get anymore rain overnight.  They can't do anything about softer conditions.  They have Sub Air on the green.  I have no idea.  We'll just wait a see.
Q. What is your mindset like coming off a delay?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Well, I mean, same as when I was playing, you are playing every shot and every hole as best you can.  I came out and had a great up-and-down to start the delay again, so that was good.
Q. Is there a secret to avoiding letdowns?  How hard is it to forget a round like this and move on to the next step?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's not like today was -- it is a good day but it wasn't like a memorable round in history or anything.  I'm going to have dinner.  I'm going to go to sleep and wake up tomorrow and forget about it.  I'm just going to be happy that my name is up the leaderboard.  It's nice to show some better form.  I've been working really hard.  Hopefully just have two more days to have same.
Q. Five strokes back, do you feel like you are in contention to win this thing?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Absolutely.  I can make up five shots in nine holes, let alone 36 holes.  I mean, there's lot of things that can happen.  I have to play great but we're only halfway through.  A lot of golf to be played, but I'm in a definitely good spot.
