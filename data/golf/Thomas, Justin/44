 Q.  Justin, 2-under 68, if we can get some comments on your day.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I played a lot better than my score. I putted really, really well, just nothing went in for me. I had a lot of putts that died off on the low side and hit some lips, burned some edges, but that's just a part of it. I feel like I was really close to shooting a really good low round and having a lead going into the weekend, but I'm in a good place and that's all I can ask for right now.   
 Q.  Speaking of going into the weekend, top of the leaderboard stacked. Talk about the excitement here and then with fans just really wanting golf to return this week, what they're getting.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I think the leaderboard speaks for itself. I looked up there at one point and I did notice that there was a lot of big names up there, not that everybody playing isn't a big name, but some of the top players in the world, so I think that that's a testimony to a good course and a good setup, so hopefully we'll give them some fireworks this weekend to watch at home.   
 Q.  And your strategy going into the weekend?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I just need to hit fairways. I got on a little bit of a run there where I hit some fairways and had some chances. Got a couple bad breaks out there today, but overall just got to capitalize when I have the shorter irons in my hand. I hit a lot of balls to 15 to 20 feet. I need to start hitting those to five to 12 feet. That's a strength of my game, and that's something that we'll tighten up.
