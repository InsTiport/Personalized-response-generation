 Q.  How hard is it to play five matches?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's tough. The end of yesterday was tough but that's still no excuse to not get it done. But I mean, that's why I train. That's why I get myself in condition so that I can do that. Tiger told me going into the week, there was a good chance I was going to and I was ready and I played, honestly, my best golf these past two days. Just played some guys that played a little better.   
 Q.  If you had an option going forward, would you rather just stick to four and kind of get that rest?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: No. I don't like it when it's out of my hands. I want to be able to control it.
