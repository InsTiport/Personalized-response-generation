JUSTIN THOMAS: It was obviously very difficult yesterday but it was playable if you hit good shots in the right spots you could, obviously, shoot under par.  But today it was out there if you're playing well and that's what I love about this golf course where, if you don't play well, you're probably going to shoot over par but if you're driving it well you have control of everything, you can make some birdies out there today.   
 Q.  You posted 10-under par, you're in the clubhouse with that number, leaders are not going crazy, you're very much a part of this so it's wait and see.  What will they see as they come down the stretch out there?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Just typical Sawgrass.  It's right in front of you, but you just have to execute.  And there's, I know I have to get fortunate to have a chance to win this tournament, but crazier things have happened.  I'm going to hang around, I'm staying tonight anyway, but I'm just happy I at least put myself in the position to think about it.   
 Q.  How big was that birdie on 18, because those were three very good shots to find a three on a brutal hole?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was.  I felt like I -- you never want to say you deserve something -- but I really hit a good three great shots on 16 and I just, just misread the putt.   
And hit a really good shot on 17 that just missed.   
So it was nice to kind of get rewarded for how I played those last three holes and a birdie is definitely a bonus on 18.   
 Q.  You had a phenomenal round today, shot 7-under, just right behind Jason Day right now.  So how did you bounce back from that 75 yesterday?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I felt like I played well yesterday.  I shot 1-under on the front and obviously it was very difficult with the scores, as everybody could see.   
But it wasn't, I felt like the score didn't reflect how I played and I've been playing well this week, so my caddie Jimmy and I just kind of tried to stick with our game plan and we got it rolling today.   
 Q.  What do you do now?  Do you wait and watch or what do you do?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: You got to wait.  You can't assume, you know, just assume that nothing crazy could happen.  I understand the odds aren't in my favor, but crazier things have happened and there's a lot of great players up there that have some birdie holes coming in, but it's, it's Sawgrass, so you never know what you're going to get.   
 Q.  Not too bad for your second time out here at THE PLAYERS, right?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I love this place.  I had a great chance to win last year and I just, something about this track and just the atmosphere, it's a really fun tournament and I look forward to playing it every year.
