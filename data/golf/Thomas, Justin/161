 Q.  A great start for Justin Thomas.  Four birdies in your first eight holes.  You were 6-up from 10.  When you hit the first tee today, did you feel like you had something special with your game?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I didn't, no.  I actually -- I don't think I had ever played with Francesco, so I didn't know what to expect.  I know his rÃ©sumÃ© and he's played in many Ryder Cups, so he's obviously a great match play player.  But I don't know if that may have helped me because I didn't focus or worry about what he was doing, I was going out and trying to hit fairways and greens and make a lot of birdies.  I was fortunate to do so.   
 Q.  We talked earlier in the week the fact that you were one in five here the last two years.  You weren't feeling your best.  But each and every day, have you felt better and have you got more confidence?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I definitely feel better.  I feel great.  My game is feeling better each day.  I'm playing better each day.  I hope I can continue to get better.  That would bode well for my performance for the tournament.  But that's thing about golf in general, let alone match play, is you don't know what you are going to get.  You don't know what your opponent is going to do.  All I can do is go out and play my game and if it's good enough to win holes and matches, then great.
