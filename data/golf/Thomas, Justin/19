Q. Statistically it seems like you found a better rhythm on the greens.  Did you feel like that was the case?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   Yeah, kind of like I said yesterday, I didn't feel as bad as I guess my stats were showing.  I was awfully optimistic for being last in the field by a mile.  That's for sure.  I don't know why.
I finally knew what I was doing, and I simply just wasn't hitting it hard enough.  The greens I feel like today were a little quicker, but the first two days definitely weren't as fast as they were in years past, so I think I've had a hard time getting used to that and adjusting to it.
I had plenty of days to get ready for it, so obviously didn't do a good enough job preparing.  But no, I felt like I wasn't that far off, and it was just nice to see a couple go in because I felt like that could have happened the first couple days.
Q. Can you take any momentum from that into tomorrow?
JUSTIN THOMAS:   For sure.  DJ is clearly playing well.  It wasn't easy today.  It's still East Lake.  But anything can happen around this course.  You can shoot 63 or 64 and you can shoot 73 or 74 very easily.  I just need to hope that tomorrow is my 63 or 64.
