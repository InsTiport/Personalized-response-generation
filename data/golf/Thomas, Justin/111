Q. How much are you looking forward to playing with Jordan tomorrow?
JUSTIN THOMAS: We obviously get along with each other really well.  I think our games kind of match each other well and go well together.  Most importantly, we know each other's personality, and I think that's really important in team play.  I know we are both chomping at the bit to get out there.
Q. What are your thoughts about playing them?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Doesn't matter who you're playing.  We have to play good golf.  Sometimes you get lucky and play guys that aren't playing as well as some others, but that's how match play is, and we know that we just have to go out and we both have to play our best, and play smart, more importantly, especially at a course like this.
Q. How much are you looking forward to teeing it up with a great friend?
JORDAN SPIETH: Very much so.  We play a lot together.  Very familiar with each other's games.  Have been for, shoot, over ten years now.  So it's going to be really exciting to be able to look at him on the first tee and kind of remember where we've come from, and we're both here.
Q. How much are you looking forward to coaching him around out there as a rookie?
JORDAN SPIETH: I don't think anybody considers him a rookie.  If either one of us -- we know each other well enough that we can see if either one is tensing up or whatnot and be able to come over and know what to say to relax each other.
