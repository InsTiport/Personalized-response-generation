Q. Well, how does the first multiple-winner of the new 2016-2017 season sound to you, and how does that change things going forward this year?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Changes things going forward because I know I'm coming back here next year, so I couldn't be more excited about that.
Yeah, it's a great feeling.  I mean, obviously I stumbled more than I would have liked to on some of those holes but I think it really shows where my game is at right now.  I had some woes there the second part of the nine, but I stuck it out to still get it done.
Q. Built a big lead and all of a sudden, Matsuyama flopped it in on 14.  How did that change your mind-set?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Didn't change it, because I'm still trying to make a bunch of birdies.  I mean, it didn't really change even after 14 or 15 after I botched that hole up, but it was an unbelievable chip he hit.  I told Jimmy, it was so hard, and he made it.  I had good looks, but they were just putts I had to be so tentative with.  There was a lot of break.  So they are putts you want to make, but you kind of want to let the hole get in the way, so there wasn't much I could do.
Q. You mentioned 15.  You did hit a couple shots that looked a little nervy maybe.  You miss-hit a couple shots.  15 was one of them.  What do you take from the back nine Sunday, you miss-hit a couple shots.  What do you take from that and what do you learn from that?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Well, it wasn't from -- I don't think it was from anything being too uncomfortable.  I think the fact that I hit it down there in the right three straight days got a little too much of me.  I was trying to hold it against the wind with a 4-iron and there's no reason I should be doing that.  I just chunk-hooked it.  I hit a lot of quality shots, the shots on 17 and the ones on 18 were nice.
Q. Where does the shot on 17 rank so far in your career?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's definitely the best this week.
