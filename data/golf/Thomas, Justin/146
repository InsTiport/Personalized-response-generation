 Q.  Thoughts on your day today?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was a better score than yesterday, for sure, but I felt like I left a pretty good amount of strokes out there.  Had some good saves there in the middle of the round and good up-and-downs.  But yeah, overall I felt like it was a, with the conditions, it was definitely a day I could have gotten a pretty low one, but hopefully, we'll get one this weekend.   
 Q.  Did the delay slow you down at all?  I know you made birdie there on 13.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not really, I got a little tired there.  I easily could have got on a couch and taken a nap during that.  But, no, that's about it.   
 Q.  What was the biggest difference in the score today from yesterday?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I just, made a couple putts today.  I didn't really make anything yesterday.  Rick and I both, we hit a lot of good putts that just kind of burned edges and just weren't going in.  So not that I made anything, or that many putts today by any means, but I had made a couple.   
 Q.  What was your reaction to Tiger's eagle there on 11?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Just a lot better than my shot.  I mean it was, I don't know, same reaction to anybody, just shake your head and acknowledge it.
