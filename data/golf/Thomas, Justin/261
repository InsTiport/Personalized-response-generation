Q. (No Microphone.)
JUSTIN THOMAS: I wasn't doing too much of that my first seven holes.  So I just kept trying to give myself looks.  I didn't do a very good job of capitalizing, but I was hitting good putts.  Just my speed wasn't right, so I just tried to stay patient, and I got hot a little bit.
Q. Obviously, we touched on you had a great rookie year that you finally broke through.  What does winning your first PGA TOUR victory mean to you?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's awesome.  I still can't believe that that just happened, and I made that par myself to win.
But I don't care how I got it done, it just feels awesome.  Thanks to everybody here for coming out.  Y'all were great, everyone one this week.  So, applause to you guys.
And I can't believe that this weather, it was a great venue, great course, I really enjoyed it.
Q. Thank you, Justin.  Speaking of that, I think we do have some rain, clouds coming in, but we look forward to having you back in Malaysia to defend the CIMB Classic in 2016.
JUSTIN THOMAS: Thank you.
