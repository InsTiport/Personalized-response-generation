 Q.  I thought it was a good start for you today.  Able to squeeze something out on the back nine.  It got hairy there for a while on the back nine.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not really.  It was just one hole.  I hit a great drive on 10, hit a bad second shot.  And there was a freaky surface there on the third.  But I had great looks on 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.  I played well, I just didn't make some of those putts, but they were putts that you had to be defensive, although you're still trying to make them.   
 Q.  How important is it to squeeze a bogey out of 10 today, to squeeze a bogey out of 13 yesterday?  You're in it now.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Anytime you can save any shots, it's big, but those doubles are -- for some reason it feels different than making two bogeys.  It's hard to make them all.   
Made that birdie on 12, and there it is, it's over with, it's done.   
 Q.  I think we all expected a little rain this week, we haven't gotten it.  Where is this golf course going if it doesn't rain tomorrow?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's so good right now, it really is.  I think you could ask everybody in the field and if they could choose -- the greens are so good, they're so pure, they're bouncing, they're firm.  I like it just for my ball flight's sake.  But you still have to go out and hit good golf shots.   
 Q.  Is it a matter of making more putts tomorrow?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I felt good over the putter, but was missing some left.  The one on 14 was tough, I had to hit it so soft.  I played it a cup and a half of break and I still missed it.
