 Q.  Justin, we were just talking off the air, it's hard not to have a good time out here in Maui.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it really is.  It's beautiful.  You can see the ocean from about every hole, and it's a great golf course.  You know, small field, we're out in twosomes, just kind of zipping around.   
Other than the fact that this is the hardest walk I think I'll ever play in golf, there's nothing really to complain about.   
 Q.  You just kind of eased your way into the round today and got busy from 8 onwards.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I was driving it well.  I made a terrible par on 5, which is probably one of the easiest holes on the course and 6 I felt like was a hole I could take advantage of.   
So to make par on those two holes is a little disappointing.  But I hit a really, really good iron, probably one of the maybe two or three good irons I hit today on 8 and I made a good putt and that kind of got momentum going.  I was driving it well, like I said.  So I really was using my wedge game from there to hit it close and make some birdies.   
 Q.  Your football game, your thoughts on there?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I have full confidence in the Tide, as always.  And Coach Saban, I know he's going to have those boys prepared and they are working hard this week.  I'm nervous.  I get nervous for every game, doesn't matter who we're playing, and Clemson looked really good against Ohio State.   
I think if we call a good game offensively, I think we'll be fine.  But I guess we'll just have to wait and see.   
 Q.  Speaking of offensively, Kiffin moving along, what's your thoughts there?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Just like when he was hired, as long as Saban approves of it, I approve of it, too.  He would never do anything to jeopardize the team.  Roll Tide.
