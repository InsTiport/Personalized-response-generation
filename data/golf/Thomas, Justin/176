Q. Not the easiest day out there for round one of the Sentry Tournament of Champions.  Justin, are you satisfied with the 2-under?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Definitely not.  I'm satisfied for after where I was through 13 holes, I definitely brought it back well.  I had the opportunity to birdie the last five holes and I just had -- the par-5s out here ate my lunch today, I played them even par, which is not very good here.
Then I had a bad 3-putt on 13.
And then made a bogey with the wedge from 114 yards in.  So I didn't play as bad as my score, so that's what's a little disappointing.
Q. What was a bit off to have you not satisfied?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Just rust.  You take some time off and not knowing exactly what the game's going to be like, at least for me it was just a little bit of rust out there.  I got off to a good start, nice and consistent and easy and then made just kind of a dumb, mental mistake on 9, not getting that first chip on the green and then kind of messed it up from there.
Same thing on 10, not playing the ball above my feet, the wind off the right, I mean it wasn't even close.  So that's the stuff that I guess that after taking some time off and not playing for a month that will get you, but it's still not a good excuse.
