Q. Just talk about 17, obviously a big turning point for you?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was a bummer.  My miss the last three or four weeks has been high and right, and that's not obviously an ideal shot for me.  Yeah, I obviously didn't hit a good one shot but it wasn't as bad as where it went to.  It kicked left on that downslope and from there, you really, for me, I felt like it was hard to even hit the green, so my one goal was just not to hit it in the water.
Hit a good one chip from there and just didn't hit a very good putt, so that was unfortunate.  Felt like it wasn't a very good way to end how I played today.
Q. After 15, where you got it so close, tapped in, did you look at the leaderboard and think you had a chance?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I've been looking at it all day and felt like if I got it to nine, I got a chance.  Obviously you don't know what Adam and Sergio is going to do.  But yeah, I just was trying to make birdies.  Unfortunately those last three holes are really hard, but yeah, I felt like I had a chance.
Q. What's your takeaway here?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's big.  I haven't played well and been in contention for a while so this is a big step in the right direction.  Felt comfortable out there again.  It was nice to get myself in the mix.
Like I said, I felt like I had a great chance to win and it was unfortunate to not get it done.  But it's a lot better than being upset, finishing whatever I did, than finishing what I have the past couple weeks.
Q. What kind of adjustments, if any, have you made this week that got you back into contention?  What was different?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I hit it really well this week.  I drove it well.  I hit some great iron shots.  I hit some bad chips, just one or two a day, but I felt like I saved some really good pars, even a couple today and yesterday.  But just everything, I was playing -- just every part of my game was really struggling to be honest.  More so than anything, I kind of had my confidence back.
Q. A lot of guys talk about they love coming back to Florida from the West Coast are one of those guys?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I don't really care.  I just get excited to play.  So many great events and great fields, so it was fun to be here.
