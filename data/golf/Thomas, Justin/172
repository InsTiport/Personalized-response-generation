Q. Tell us about your round out there.
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was a good day.  I definitely kind of messed up some holes out there.  I mean, my three bogeys were just horrendous -- three-putt in 1, had a perfect sand wedge into 3 and made bogey, and then three-putted 12 again.  I guess in reality those were probably four wasted shots, but to be still 4 under after that is good.
Q. Do you feel like these are mistakes that you can clean up as you go along the next few weeks?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Absolutely.  It's getting better every day.  My alignment's been getting a little bit to the right.  So I think when I get this left-right wind like I did on 3 and it's even with the sand wedge, I'm going to miss it over there.  That's just stuff I've got to clean up a little bit.
Q. This morning was a little bit of an interesting morning in Hawaii.  When you got that alert on your phone, what was your reaction?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I actually never got it for some reason.  I don't know why, but it never went through to my phone.  Tom Lovelady screen shot it and sent it to me and asked what was going on.  I was like there's nothing I can do.  I sat on my couch and opened up the sliding door and watched TV and listened to music.  I was like, if it's my time, it's my time.  There's really nothing I can do.
Q. I think you mentioned, if you had three good rounds and one low round, you have a chance to win here.  Do you feel like, if you get that low round tomorrow, you might have a shot?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It just depends what the leaders do.  There's a lot of birdie holes left.  I'll be very, very fortunate if the lead stays at 14 or even 15 under par.  You can definitely go low out here, and I know that I can, but it's just a matter of doing it.  I'm glad that I've put myself in somewhat of a position to be in contention a little bit.
Q. How did you feel about today?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was good.  It wasn't -- I mean, the front nine, I'm a little disappointed with.  I feel like I easily could have shot 5 or 6 under with some of the clubs I had and the greens and a couple stupid bogeys.  But, yeah, I just got to get that distance control and my wedges back.
Q. Interesting way to start your day this morning.  How did you experience it?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I didn't really do much.  I just sat on my couch, listened to music, watched TV, and kind of opened up the sliding door.  I'm just there was nothing I could do.  It was either going to happen, or it wasn't.  I actually never got the alert on my phone for some reason.  One of my buddies sent it to me.  Just looking on the news, there wasn't anything, and there wasn't anything online.  So I knew it wasn't that serious.
Q. Did you talk about it coming out here?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, everybody was talking about it for sure.
Q. How close do you think you need to be at the end of the day to have a chance?  What's the bigger deal, the number of strokes or number of players?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Probably number of players, I would say for sure.  But if I could stay within five, that would be great.  You can go shoot 8 or 9 under in a heartbeat out here.  It's hard if you're five back and you're in 15th or 20th as opposed to five back and you're in 6th or 7th, but, yeah, we'll just wait and see.
