Q. Last year it was a little bit of a struggle coming down the stretch.  What was the difference this year versus last year?  Last year I know it was relief to get your first one.  What's it like this year?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I don't know.  It's very odd.  I was extremely comfortable out there.  I was playing really well all week.  I just had a little stretch there yesterday where I played really poorly.  But Jimmy did an unbelievable job this week keeping me calm when it got tough yesterday, and I just -- we stuck to our game plan and I made some putts.  I made some key up-and-downs there on 12 and 13 but feels great.
Q. What was the difference today versus last night when you finished?  How big of a difference was that last night versus what Anirban did?
JUSTIN THOMAS: A lot.  Funny as it was, I was talking to Rickie last night and he said he had a finish on Saturday that won him the golf tournament on Sunday.  You know, I felt like that was maybe the biggest five holes I've ever played in my life, even more so than last year, because it gave me a chance.  If I'm going into today eight or nine back, I have no chance, or at least I don't think.
It was huge.  It really gave me a lot of momentum and I was within striking distance.
Q. Second win now, how does that change your goals going forward?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I'm just so excited; I get to go back to Kapalua.  I love it there.  I'm so excited.  Hardest part was trying not to think about that those last couple holes.
It really doesn't change much.  This is what you play for.  You play to get in these situations and handle them well, and I felt like I did.  It's a great start to the year.
