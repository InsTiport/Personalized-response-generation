Q. You made a charge, it wasn't quite enough, but you took home a memory of a lifetime on 16. Tell us about that?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I think it might take a little bit to set in, because I'm a little frustrated about the rest of the day. But it was something that nobody will ever be able to take away from me. It was pretty cool and it was definitely something I'll remember. 

Q. You hit the shot. You know it's good. And you can see the ball from the tee. It goes in and you just heard the explosion from the patrons. How did that make you feel?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was cool. It was actually funny, right when I hit it, Phil and I were kind of walking off together, and I said jokingly, how about a 1, Phil. When everybody stands up that's when you'll know, because everyone stood up for Jon's shot I had a chance and everyone did for mine. And it kind of disappeared and he kind of looked at me and I looked at him, and I said I can't believe that actually went in.

Q. Have you ever had a hole‑in‑one on this type of stage?
A.No, there's nothing you can compare to this stage. The Par‑3 contest is probably the closest I've come. 

Q. Have you had a good time at the Masters this year?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I played great again. I have to figure out how to score better, because I played well enough to win this golf tournament by quite a few. It's frustrating.
