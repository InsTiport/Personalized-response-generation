Q. 2-under par 68 today.  A little slow start.  How did you turn it around today?
JUSTIN THOMAS: That was a really weird round of golf I'd say, that first nine.  Just tried to stay patient.  I had a really hard time getting focused and getting into it today.  I don't know why, what the purpose was.  I told Jimmie, man, I'm having a hard time with this today and I need your help.  He kept me in it and we tried to talk to our shots a little more.  That birdie on 18, the ninth hole, kind of got me going.
Q. What was your thought process coming in this week?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Just see what I can do with what I have.  I mean, my game definitely isn't where I would want it to be but I mean, I'm more proud of rounds like today than I am when I play really well.
Obviously I'd like the score, if it was lower -- but coming into this week knowing I'm almost not sure of what I have because I wasn't able to prepare as well as I would have liked last week with just everything going on and being tired.
Really trying to somehow get myself in the mix and see what happens.
Q. A lot of rain Tuesday night and the golf courses was soft yesterday.  Did it change?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It was soft.  I hit some shots out there that were spinning back a lot, kind of low ones that weren't bouncing up.  It's obviously easier when it's soft but it's almost so soft that it was a little harder because you're planning for it to skip a little bit and it wouldn't.  But you know, everyone has to play in the same conditions.
