 Q.  Did it feel weird starting a Thursday with the lead today?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not really. I tried not to think about it too much. It just -- I don't know. I felt I did a really good job in terms of getting myself where I need to be mentally. I just didn't quite hit enough fairways.   
 Q.  Other than not hitting the fairways and the one shot on 15, you feel pretty good about how you played?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, that's kind of what I was saying to Roger over there. Although my stats showed I didn't hit many fairways, if you put my combined total of fairways missed, it wasn't that much. Felt like I didn't hit that bad of a drive on 5, and it just kind of clipped a tree and went back into a really bad place when I easily could have had the same kind of shot Patrick did where he made birdie. And then holes like 8, where I missed the fairway by this, and then I go from having a wedge in to now I'm just trying to hit the green and hope.   
So it was very, very close out there, but I definitely -- that being said, that's golf, and I just needed to hit the fairways. It definitely was -- easily could have shot 3 or 4 or 5 under today even with what I have.   
 Q.  Taking more positives than negatives out of the round?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: For sure. I felt like last week I was missing fairways, but they didn't feel like great drives. They were just -- they weren't really that -- they were very offline, and they weren't that solid. I'm hitting them a lot more solid now, and they're just hanging in there. But if I can just tighten it just a fraction, even with those couple of missed putts, I feel pretty good over my putter. I had a lot of great rolls today, it just didn't go in. Three days with a tie for the lead. I'm in a good spot.   
 Q.  Are you going to do a little work with the driver at the end of the day?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: No. I have plenty of time tomorrow if I want to come out, but I drove it really, really well. I hit good 3 wood on 12 and 13 that, again, just missed the fairway by a couple of feet. And really from 14 in, I hit some really quality drives when I felt like I needed to, and I'm going to use that for momentum going into tomorrow because I felt like I hit the shots exactly how I wanted to.
