Q. Moving day works both ways.  You are not necessarily out of the realm.  You shoot a good number and see what the guys ahead of you do and you are still in the hunt.
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, yeah.  I just got to see where we're at tomorrow.
Q. What was the key to today?  Not a great round, but you are still in the mix?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I mean, it's -- everyone had to play the same course.  It got tough out there.  I don't know what these guys are going to do coming in, but hopefully I'll have a chance tomorrow.
Q. Weather the biggest factor today?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah.  The setup on a couple of holes, but the weather definitely made it a lot harder.
