Q. Justin, great playing.  Way to kind of start the season after finishing off with a great season.  I know you would have loved to get to the final event, but great playing last year.
JUSTIN THOMAS: Thank you.  Yeah, it was a good year.  Obviously one event, or couple events from a great year.  Yeah, just a couple weeks to get back and ready and geared up for this one.  Pleased with my start.
Q. Feel like a new season or kind of still in last year's mode?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It does now.  I kind of had a hard time getting ready.  Not getting ready, but just in the mind frame.  It was weird we had a golf tournament today.  Once we tee'd up and got going, got the juices going again.
Q. Feels pretty good to get started.  Everybody is at zero right now, tied with everybody.
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, tied for the lead to start the day.  I'll take a bunch more of those rounds today.  Be pleased.
Q. What are your thoughts going into the season?  Going to play quite a bit or take more time off?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not near as much as I did last year.  As a rookie you have to play a lot.  Although I feel like I'm obviously healthy enough and have enough energy to play, it's just not what I need to do.  I need to focus on some events and work my way into the bigger events; try to shorten to maybe four or five events and try to get some wins.
