 Q.  Your first time out here at the TOUR Championship ended on a birdie.  How much does that help you?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: It helps a lot.  I finished it on 18, the par 5, I hit a great drive out there.  So to just try to put one in the middle of the green and two-putt and finish with a birdie was great.  I kind of struggled a little bit in the middle of the round but finished strongly to finish off a good day.   
 Q.  Is the atmosphere out here everything you expected or above and beyond?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's just different.  I'm not used to a tournament with 30 guys.  You're there when everyone tees off and here when everyone finishes.  So it's different.  It's fun.  I wish there were more tournaments like this throughout the year.  It's a cool feeling.  The fans, it's great for them because they get to see more golf or kind of see some different groups.   
Yeah, it's a cool atmosphere, and you can hear the roars.   
 Q.  Off to a solid start.  Good luck the rest of the week.
