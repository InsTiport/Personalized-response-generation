JUSTIN THOMAS: It's such a condensed leaderboard, it's unbelievable.  I think I saw I'm like 40-something place, and 5-under is leading the tournament.  It's very, very condensed.  Through three or four holes tomorrow I could make it all up or it could take me over the course of four days.
But I feel like I'm really, really playing well, and I'm close to -- I'm even closer than I was in the middle of the season into reeling something good off.  Trying to keep my head down and keep plugging.
Q. Do you have any plans to play in China this season?
JUSTIN THOMAS: I don't know, I'm worried about the second round of the British Open first.
