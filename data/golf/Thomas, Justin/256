Q. 1-under, you have to be pleased, because that was pretty tough out there?
JUSTIN THOMAS: That was really tough.  I think this wind direction, the course is tough as it is but this wind direction definitely makes it more difficult.  Got off to I guess a slow-ish start, but on the back nine I knew I needed to hold it together.  Felt like I played solid.  I felt like a lot of aspects of my game were kind of clicking and it was fun to play well.
Q. What was more tough, the wind or the wetness?
JUSTIN THOMAS: Definitely the wind.  I was honestly surprised how dry it was.  I felt it was very similar to yesterday.  I didn't think it was too much softer.  But it was good.  Didn't really have any mud balls.  Nobody in our group had any.  The hardest part was just playing 20, 25, 30 yards when it was straight in and straight down, so that was tough.
Q. Is it tough to concentrate when you're out there and the wind is blowing?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's just draining, it is, because you don't get very many easy pars.  You'll have maybe some stretch of holes where you hit the green, 2-putt here or there.  But you're going to have at least three, four, five times where you're going to have to grind to make a par, and I had to do so today.  But just it's difficult and it's a grind.  Like I said, I was pleased to get in 1-under.
Q. Happy where you are right now?
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's been better.  Just trying to trend the right direction and be peaking by the Match Play and the Masters.  That's most important right now.  But I feel like I'm going in the right direction.
