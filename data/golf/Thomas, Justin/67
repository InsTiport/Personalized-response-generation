 Q.  Half-point. Describe how things closed over the final two holes and what's the emotions of only being able to get a half a point out of this one?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I think speechless. It's unacceptable for us to get a half a point. I mean, they made a couple long putts there on 15 and 16 to keep it going. You know, we had our chances, and I mean, flat honest, just didn't execute. I'm just disappointed in myself for burning that, I felt like, for us on 18.   
Our team is playing well today, and we've got to put it behind us and go get a point tomorrow.   
 Q.  Still able to get that half-point, the U.S. with some momentum. What are some positives that you can take from this session as a whole?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Putting points up on the board is always a good thing. Yeah, we wanted to take care of our match, and Leish and Abe did a great job of fighting back. Like J.T. said, they made some great putts, and we unfortunately weren't able to convert a couple of the chances that we had.   
That's the way it is. That's the way match play goes. We flipped them a few times on 18 yesterday, and just gives us a little bit more work to do tomorrow. But it's something that we can take care of.
