 Q.  Talk about your round today, 8-under par with only one bogey?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was a good day.  It was solid.  If there's such a thing as an easy 8-under, it was.  I wedged it great.  I took advantage of the first three par 5s.  I just hit a terrible 3-putt on the first par 5, No. 3.  But just kind of went along my business today.  I was just very comfortable and I hit it in there close a couple times and made a couple putts but it was a pretty low-stress day.   
 Q.  Your first opportunity to defend a championship on the PGA TOUR.  What's it been like for you since you got here from the Safeway?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, game feels good.  It does.  But it's fun.  I've never had the opportunity to defend before.  Only other time I've won professionally was the Web.com and I wasn't there the next year.   
So it's cool.  It's fun being back and people know who I am or are just kind of, you know, hope you win this year kind of thing, too.  It's been fun.  It's been new but hopefully an experience I get to experience a lot.   
 Q.  You played at Alabama so you're used to the heat.  Is it anything like this kind of heat and how do you deal with it?  I asked Sergio the same question.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: It's just different, man.  It's very similar to Florida heat.  It gets really hot in Louisville where I'm from, too, in the summers.  But I feel like once it gets to about that 95, 100 heat index, it's all the same.  We're wearing pants, we're sweating a lot and it's really just trying to maintain energy.   
I felt really weird to start the day.  I told Jimmy I felt kind of like Jello and I just felt weak, but I just tried to drink as many waters as possible.   
I played well today.  It was kind of an easy, low-stress day.  I didn't make it too hard on myself.  Whenever I got it out of play off the tee I managed to at least find the green.  Made a lot of short putts out there, which can be tough to do sometimes on these greens.  Yeah, it was a good day.   
 Q.  How were the conditions out there today compared to 2015?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Well, it's the first time I felt wind here before.  Obviously wasn't very strong but it was at least there.  Made us think a little bit and had to flight some shots and kind of had to play for it a little bit.   
Yeah, the course is very similar.  The fairways are soft.  The greens have a good firmness to them and yeah, it's in great shape.   
 Q.  The good memories that came back to you today, did it feel like dÃ©jÃ  vu?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Not really.  It's only the first day.  Obviously have a good memories here after last day.  There's some spots, we had a lot of similar pins to Sunday last year and Jimmy and I kept talking about that, how the pins are very similar.  I guess maybe a little bit with something like that.  But just more so just focussed on the day.
