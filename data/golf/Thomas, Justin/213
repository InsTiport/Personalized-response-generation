 Q.  Ask you about 10, it was a good bogey.  Walk us through that hole and what happened and the save.  
JUSTIN THOMAS: I hit a great 3-wood there.  It's a tough tee shot for me.  And I just hit an awful 7-iron.  I shouldn't have been trying to go at that pin, because that left bunker you can use the slope and get it close.  I was trying to play right of the pin because using the slope and with the pin being left and I just pushed it.  It was a really, really bad swing.  But I shouldn't have been going at the pin.  And it was sitting okay.  I felt like I could get the club under it and I was really trying to hit a huge flop.  It was like hitting off concrete.   
It was weird because I felt like -- I could tell it was firm, but I didn't think it was that firm.  I felt like it was hard pan and it was going to go a little farther.  And I hit the dead center of the ball and it went about 60 yards.   
 Q.  How thankful were you to get a bogey and not what it could have been?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, it was a great up-and-down.  Those are the ones that save some rounds.  You never know, that could have been the up-and-down that ends up winning me the tournament, who knows.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JUSTIN THOMAS: She said I made her day and life a lot easier.   
 Q.  How much leaderboard watching were you doing?  Obviously you're paying attention to your own game, but this was quite a moving day?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Yeah, I was looking at them whenever they're in front of me.  They're pretty big.  They're kind of hard to miss.  They're probably -- I guess they kind of do have them about every hole.  Just glance at them.  Saturday is not really a time to change game plan because of where you are.  I was happy to see I was closer to the the lead, obviously, but, yeah, I was just trying to go play my game.   
 Q.  Who all is here for you?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: Mom, dad and grandparents, yeah.   
 Q.  Is it more distracting to play with your best friend?  
JUSTIN THOMAS: No.  We're out there playing golf.  We're not too worried about the fact that we're friends.
