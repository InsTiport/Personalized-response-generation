 Q.  Great round, 70 on a challenging course like No. 2.  How did you stay not in bogey range?  
AUSTIN HITT: Yeah, I hit it pretty well.  If you can keep it in the fairways you have a better chance of getting it on the greens.  And then from there took advantage of some good shots I hit, was able to make a couple birdies.  But, yeah, it was really tough and I was happy with how I played.   
 Q.  So going into No. 4 tomorrow, a little better scores over there, do you think you'll play a little more aggressive or how will your strategy change?  
AUSTIN HITT: No, not really, kind of the same strategy, just keep it on the fairway, get it on the greens and try to make a couple putts.  It's that simple.   
 Q.  How do you feel about the Pinehurst courses?  
AUSTIN HITT: They're great, I love coming down here.  I've come down here a bunch of times with Josh, obviously, like I was saying, and been lucky enough to play a couple times, so always enjoy being down here.
