 Q.  Great round today, 1-under, fantastic finish with three birdies in the last five holes.  What was going through your mind as you came down the stretch?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: Well, I was very angry because I made two bogeys, stupid bogeys.  I missed two shots, two easy shots.  But yesterday, I had a hard end, a hard finish, so today was pretty focused on that and keep going.   
 Q.  Did you know the significance of the birdie on the last for the qualification for the last week?  Did you know on the tee?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: No.   
 Q.  They just told you in the recording it might give you a chance to play?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: Right.   
 Q.  So what are you going to do now, look at the leaderboards?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: Well, I have something to eat and I will say.  I just have to wait.   
 Q.  You played in the RICOH before?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: Twice.   
 Q.  The last two years?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: Yeah, I missed the cut, so I'm looking forward.   
 Q.  If you don't qualify, you'll be playing in the qualifier?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: Yeah.   
 Q.  What he is your links experience beyond the RICOH Women's British Open?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: I played a lot of British when I was an amateur and this was my first British Girls' here.   
 Q.  Here at Gullane?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: It was.  So funny to be here and say, I was here before.   
 Q.  How did you get on in that?  Can you remember?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: Yeah, I made the cut and I lose in the first round because it's match play after.  I missed against a German girl.   
 Q.  Did you enjoy this week?  
NURITA ITURRIOS: Yeah, I loved it.  The first day was 3-over, and the second day was 2-under.  But I made the cut with two birdies on the last holes and that was very good for me.
