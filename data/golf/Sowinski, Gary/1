 Q. Can you take us through that eagle you made on 7. 
 GARY SOWINSKI: That was the only highlight of my day. I got to think. Oh, yeah, I hit it basically at the same place I've tried to hit it every day here. And it just had, I don't know, we hit it right where we knew we needed to, to the right, and it took the hill. 
 And I was very fortunate. Kirk had a putt on a similar line and I thought the putt was going to break to the right and I watched him hit it and it never broke. So I took it straight in and it stayed straight and went in and I said, shazam, there it goes. 

 Q. Have you changed your club selection due to the altitude?
 GARY SOWINSKI: We did all the calculations and then took off 10 percent for the elevation change and then that would give us what we refer to as the playing yardage and then we would hit that club. 
 So it was kind of weird, we would have an actual yardage and then a playing yardage. Like just say 200 was the actual, playing 180 and then we would hit a club for the 180. 

 Q. What was the most useful club in your bag today?
 GARY SOWINSKI: My driver. I hit it good all week and just never scored very well, but I probably hit almost every fairway. I think I missed maybe one fairway in the two days. 

 Q. Can you just give us a general overall experience of this competition compared to your previous ones?
 GARY SOWINSKI: Well, I've always enjoyed playing in these kinds of events. This one's great. The golf course is brutally hard. The greens are brutal. And then when we played, we drew yesterday afternoon, we drew playing through all the wind. 
 So it's a very, very hard golf course in the wind, but just like so many golf courses, they're so great and so much fun to play, you kind of block that out and just have a great time and enjoy your time here.
