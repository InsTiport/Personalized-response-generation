  Q. Couple of birdies, did you feel like you had a chance of having a good round there early on?  
 GARY SOWINSKI: I really did. I made a couple mistakes. I hit a really bad tee shot on 12 and had a bad lie in the rough, advanced it about 10 feet and made a quick double. And that kind of got me reeling a little bit. But I played fairly well and still made a couple mistakes and out here you can't really make too many.   
  
  Q. Did you have a best club in the bag today anything you felt like you were hitting really well?  
 GARY SOWINSKI: My putter was pretty good, except for a couple holes where I didn't realize it was kind of as fast going down the hill as it was. And on number 8 over here I got it on the top of the green and the pin's in the front and the front right and you just have no chance from there and but it was a very interesting putt I'll just say at the least.  
  
  Q. Do you make a couple adjustments for tomorrow?  
 GARY SOWINSKI: Just going to go do what I do and just keep trying to hopefully not make any mental mistakes otherwise I can pack it in and go home. If I don't make any mental mistakes I might be here for the weekend.
