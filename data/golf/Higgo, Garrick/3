Q. How happy are you to be in the quarter finals?
GARRICK HIGGO: I can't even explain it to you.  I'm really, really happy.
Q. Is this a proud moment for you as a South African?
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
Q. When you have seen other, what we would call international players win this championship, like Min Woo Lee did last year, does that give you confidence that you can win it too?
GARRICK HIGGO: Definitely.  I've played with Min Lee, well, not with him, but I've played in tournaments that he's played in.  Yeah, it did give me confidence.
Q. What do you think was the key in your game today to beating Cole hammer?
GARRICK HIGGO: Just consistent.  If you miss the fairway, just miss it.  If you hit it on the green 20 foot, you don't have to hit it stiff.  Just make a pause, make a few birdies.
Q. You got up on him early and birdied the 5th.  How did you birdie that hole?
GARRICK HIGGO: The 5th, the par-5.  Yeah, I hit driver, and I had 270 to the flag, 270 meters, and hit driver again to like 40-foot, and then two-putted.
Q. How close was it?
GARRICK HIGGO: 40-foot, driver, driver, 40 foot.
Q. That's a long putt.
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, I mean, I hit it to like 15 foot, and then I made the 15-footer.
Q. Then he missed a short one at 11, and you were conceded the birdie at the par-5, 11th, too, right?
GARRICK HIGGO: Uh-huh, yeah.
Q. What did you hit to get on that green?
GARRICK HIGGO: 3-iron.
Q. How far did you have there?
GARRICK HIGGO: 210 to the flag.
Q. Then when you're on 17, you're still only 1-up.  What are you thinking on the tee there?
GARRICK HIGGO: Just hit the green, because if I lost it all, it would have been a struggle mentally and par-5, 18th, anything can happen with water left, rough right.
Q. So you're looking at the middle of the green on 17?
GARRICK HIGGO: Not right at the green, because the wind was blowing off the right.
