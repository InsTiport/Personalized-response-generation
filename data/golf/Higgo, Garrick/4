 Q.  Nice win today.  
GARRICK HIGGO: Thank you.   
 Q.  Is this your first win in a USGA event?  Because last year you lost in the first round.  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, I lost in the first round, yeah.   
 Q.  You didn't make the cut at the Amateur; correct?  
GARRICK HIGGO: No, at the Amateur I missed it by three.   
 Q.  Any difference in the game this year versus last year?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Maybe a bit longer, just overall consistent.   
 Q.  Now you going to college this year, this fall?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Next year.   
 Q.  UNLV?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, UNLV.   
 Q.  Do you know Warren Schutte at all?  He's a UNLV guy that won back in '82?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, I don't know him, but I've heard of him.   
 Q.  How does a kid from South Africa end up in Las Vegas?  
GARRICK HIGGO: I don't know.   
 Q.  Were you just playing in the States?  Did he discover you?  
GARRICK HIGGO: I sent him an email, Coach Rowe and Coach Knight because I did some research on colleges, and (inaudible).   
 Q.  So you heard of those names?  Was that kind of the reason why you went?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, I heard Coach Knight is a good short game coach, and a lot of great courses there so.   
 Q.  So you come over here then for the whole summer?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Basically, yeah.  Until the beginning of October.  So I'll play the Western Am next week or in two weeks time, and then the Junior PLAYERS at TPC Sawgrass.   
 Q.  That's in August?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Then Junior's Presidents Cup.   
 Q.  Okay.  So that would be in the New York area?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, it's pretty close.   
 Q.  Are they playing Bayonne or which course are you playing?  
GARRICK HIGGO: I'm not sure.   
 Q.  When do they pick the team?  
GARRICK HIGGO: 3rd of August.   
 Q.  Are you in the Am too?  
GARRICK HIGGO: I missed out by one.   
 Q.  Are you an alternate?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah.   
 Q.  So did you do anything the week of the Am then?  
GARRICK HIGGO: We're going to go to LA.   
 Q.  Oh, you're going to go to LA?  
GARRICK HIGGO: See if I get in there.  I'll just go there and say I'm here, so if someone pulls out.   
 Q.  I think I read on your bio you used to play rugby?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah.   
 Q.  Why did you give that up?  
GARRICK HIGGO: I broke my elbow.   
 Q.  Oh, that would make sense, golf's a little --  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yes.   
 Q.  Did you play golf at the same time you're playing rugby?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, I played golf most of my life.  But in seventh grade I broke my elbow and had to choose between the two.   
 Q.  Obviously, golf is a little less physical.  It says on your bio too you like ping-pong.  How good?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Pretty good.   
 Q.  Ever played competitively?  
GARRICK HIGGO: No, no, no, just with friends.   
 Q.  I know juniors are into ping-pong.  Did you do it here this week at all?  
GARRICK HIGGO: No, we're not staying in the Marriott.   
 Q.  Where are you staying in?  
GARRICK HIGGO: We're staying at the hotel at River Walk.   
 Q.  Are your parents here this week?  
GARRICK HIGGO: My mom and sister, yeah.   
 Q.  So did they come over for the week or the whole summer?  
GARRICK HIGGO: They're coming over until -- they're staying until after the Western Am.   
 Q.  Okay.  When did you get to the States then?  
GARRICK HIGGO: About three weeks ago.  I played the Dogwood Invitational and (Indiscernible) Am.   
 Q.  When does school start back up for you?  
GARRICK HIGGO: I home school.   
 Q.  So you've been taking it with you and just take your classes and in between the golf you figure out how many classes you have left to finish up?  
GARRICK HIGGO: Yeah, exactly.   
 Q.  When do you finish school?  
GARRICK HIGGO: November.   
 Q.  So will you enroll at UNLV then?  
GARRICK HIGGO: In January, maybe, yeah.  Still talking about that.
