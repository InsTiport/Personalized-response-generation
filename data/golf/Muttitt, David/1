Q.   Two really solid rounds of golf?
DAVID MUTTITT:   Yeah, I played good; I just had five bad holes yesterday.   It was tough.   It's like nothing else I have ever been a part of.

Q.   What are your thoughts of the rain this morning?
DAVID MUTTITT:   Oh, that was tough.   It rained hard and then it would stop, and then it rained hard and then it stopped.   Just like in Oregon, exactly the same, just warmer.

Q.   Talk about the round specifically today. 
DAVID MUTTITT:   I mean, I struggled on the front nine, didn't hit it solid, but I made some good pars and a couple of good birdies.   And then I played good on the back. 
Bogeying 18 is a little bit frustrating, but you can't miss the fairways on those long parâ€‘4s.

Q.   Talk about the experience.   Was it everything you thought it was going to be?
DAVID MUTTITT:   Yeah, and more.   It's crazy.   Just so many people it's unbelievable.   You don't think about all the stuff that goes into it, running tournaments, myself.   This is just nuts.   I couldn't imagine.

Q.   Not making the cut, but did you enjoy the whole experience?
DAVID MUTTITT:   Yeah, absolutely.   I mean, I'm disappointed because I played good enough to make the cut.   I just had five terrible holes yesterday.   Yeah, I mean, I had a great time.

Q.   Is there a favorite story from this week that you are going to tell the people back home?
DAVID MUTTITT:   I got to hit balls next to Tiger.
