 Q.  So you're 3-under today after the first 18; how would you assess your performance today?  
TIFFANY CHAN: I think I played pretty good.  Missed a few putts that I could have made, but I made back birdies, so I made up for the 6 that I made.  I had a little three-putt on 9, which was 18 for me.  But I think overall I played pretty good.  Hitting was good.  I only missed one green today, which was the first hole, my tenth hole.  The actual 1st hole I missed one green, so I made bogey.  Yeah, I made 17 greens, five birdies.  Hope that I can continue that for the rest of the week.   
 Q.  Now, you were even par after the first nine.  The second nine you had four birdies?  
TIFFANY CHAN: Yeah.   
 Q.  What sort of clicked there in that five-hole spin?  
TIFFANY CHAN: I think I made bogey on the first hole and then I birdied the third hole, the par-3.  I hit it pretty close, like three feet, and then from there -- I made another long putt on the fifth hole.  I think I made it like 18 feet, like an 18-foot putt.  I think that's the longest putt I made today, but the rest of them is within like six feet.   
So I think I did a pretty good job today.   
 Q.  So just good approach shots?  
TIFFANY CHAN: Yeah, I think I just hit it close and gave myself good enough chances for birdies.
