 Q.   Sorry it didn't work out for you today, but that was a wonderful match.   
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   It was a really good match.   
   
 Q.   You got up early, won the first two holes.   Tell me about what happened there.   Brooke was saying you had a really good birdie on the second hole.   
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Yeah, I did.   I had a good birdie on the second hole.   I hit a really good approach shot, really good putt.   I was rolling really good putts all day.   I mean, I made all the short putts, I just‑‑ a couple of the longer ones that I wanted to drop didn't.   But I mean, I played solid, and we both played pretty well.  
   
 Q.   You took the No.2 player in the world to the 18th green.   I understand it's disappointing, but you've still got to feel good about the way that you played.   
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Definitely.   It gives me a lot of confidence.   I know I've been playing well.   I know I'm a good player, but I can compete, and it makes me believe that I can compete anywhere.   It's definitely good for my confidence.  
   
 Q.   And it gets you a bunch of exemptions for next year.   
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Yes, I'm very excited.   It's going to be good for my world amateur ranking, as well.
