 Q.  So 7 & 6, pretty smooth victory today?  HANNAH O'SULLIVAN: Yeah, I played a lot more consistent and solid than the last two days.  I was happier with the way I was playing.  But I just told myself -- I got out to a pretty early lead, I think like 3-up through 5, but I just told myself you have to keep pushing and try and do it as quickly as possible because in match play anything can happen.  Just two weeks ago I was like 3-down with four left and I halved the match, and in the Junior, Phillip was 5-down with six to play or whatever, so I knew I just had to keep pushing and just not let it slip and just try to finish it as quickly as possible.   Q.  What are your thoughts on this golf course?  I think you said you struggled a little bit on the first day?  HANNAH O'SULLIVAN: Yeah, I love this course.  The accuracy is very, very important here, so I'm just -- each time I play it, I think I'm getting more comfortable with the narrow fairways, and my scrambling is getting a lot better through each round.  And just getting used to the putting here, too.  These greens have a lot of subtle breaks, so like a putt that looks a little downhill is super, super quick.  Just with more experience, I'm getting more comfortable with the course.
