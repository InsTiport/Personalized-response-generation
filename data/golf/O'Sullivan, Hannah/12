Q.   Well, congratulations on the big win today. 
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Thank you.

Q.   Tell us how you're feeling right now. 
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Yeah, really it's kind of a dream come true.   I've been playing really well this summer.   Some of my results haven't really shown it.   It feels great to be able to come out and play really solid golf, and I just figure one shot at a time.   I had no expectations, and it turned in my favor, and I'm really happy.

Q.   You got down early.   I think you lost the second hole that was?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   And then you come back, and you've showed yourself this week that you can come back.   I'm sure this is helping with your confidence right now?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Definitely.   I just told myself to stay patient, and basically I told myself I can't lose.   I just can't lose, so I just kept pushing, and I stayed really even keel and calm and just, yeah, it turned in my favor. 

Q.   How old were you when you took up golf?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   I was about six and a half years old.

Q.   Why?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   I liked mini‑golf a lot when I was a kid and I was trying out all different sports.   I played really anything you could name, I played it.   So I decided to try golf and fell in love with it and stuck with it.

Q.   You got good right away?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   The first year it was just taking it kind of casually but then started playing tournaments, then I won‑‑ about a couple months after I played my first tournament, I won a tournament, and it kind of made me like it.

Q.   Am I correct in guessing that there's some Irish background in your father's side here?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Yes.   My dad is a big, tall Irishman, yeah. 

Q.   And you were born in Singapore?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   I was.   I was born in Singapore because my dad was over there for business, and when I was about one, we moved to California. 

Q.   So you're a regular California kid?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Definitely. 

Q.   What were your other sports?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   I did soccer, figure skating, gymnastics, softball, swimming, tennis.   I did dance.   So yeah, everything. 

Q.   You have energy?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Yeah.

Q.   What was the hardest part about today, if there was a hard part? 
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Not getting ahead of myself probably.   I just told myself to take it one shot at a time, focus on my own game, and I can't really control anything else that's happening. 

Q.   And it wasn't hard playing against a really old person like Grace?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   No, she's a great player, so it was definitely a tough match.   I mean, I just tried to push those thoughts away and focus on my own game. 

Q.   Thinking back to the match today, was there any particular hole that you felt really stood out to you as one that you played particularly well?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Probably 12.   I made a really good birdie from off the green, but I putted that.   I went 4‑up with six to go, so I think that definitely sealed the deal, I think.

Q.   About how far was that?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   It was about 30 feet.

Q.   A lot of people have been telling the story today about how you grew up kind of maybe idolizing or really looking up to Grace.   What's that dynamic like?   It's an individual sport but you guys all know each other.   What's it like playing a good friend?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Yeah, it's definitely tough.   It's hard that one has to win and one has to lose for sure.   But I mean, I'm here to play golf, and that comes first.   Just play, and I respect her.   But I just focus on my own game, and I got the job done.

Q.   And next you think you'll have either or Brooke or Alison.   What do you know about their games or what don't you know about their games?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Well, they're both good players, so it'll definitely be a tough match.   At this point in the tournament it's all about endurance and staying calm and taking one shot at a time, don't get too upset or don't get too excited.   Whoever I play tomorrow, I just need to focus on that and focus on my own game. 

Q.   Is this the farthest you've ever made it in a match play event?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   In a USGA event.   In 2010 when I was 12 I won the California Junior Girls State Championship, and that was kind of funny, too, because in the finals I played another girl that I sort of looked up to.   She was like 17, I was 12.

Q.   Who was that?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   Mariko Tumangan, and she had just committed to Stanford, and I was like, oh, my goodness, what's going on.   But I was able to win.   A little dÃ©jÃ ‑vu, I guess.

Q.   But a good experience to look back on?
HANNAH O'SULLIVAN:   A very good experience.   Whenever I need a little boost of confidence, I can look back on those memories.
