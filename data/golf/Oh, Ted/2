  Q. You had a long day starting at six in the morning but all that matters is now you're at the at that point?  
 TED OH: Yeah, I played well. I was playing good all year long but I was struggling on the greens, and then last week, I started putting well and then I think that's why I'm scoring better.  
  
  Q. After almost a five- or six-hour delay, did it really affect you a lot?  
 TED OH: I have a lot of family with me this week, so I kept busy talking to them and stuff, so that was okay.   
 But things like this, if I were to be in Malaysia or somewhere else, I would be just waiting by myself which is kind of hard but this week I have my family with us.
