 Q. Lovely round of 70, are you happy with that? 
 TED OH: I'm happy with 70, but I felt like I could have -- I made a couple silly mistakes on the back nine where I thought it was downhill and it was an uphill putt and I made a couple bogeys like that. I'm kind of disappointed that way but I'm happy with 70. 

 Q. You've never won on the Asian Tour, you've not won on The European Tour; do you think you're due? 
 TED OH: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, last couple of years, I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself, but you know I'm going to go out there tomorrow and just try to play my game. 
 If it's windy I'm going to try to shoot about 2-, 3-under par and I'm not going to look at the leaderboard that much and try to chase it. I made a couple of mistakes in the past, so I'm just going to play my game.

 Q. What would you prefer a winds-day like today or nice, calm conditions where you can really shoot low?
 TED OH: Well, I 5-under the first day, there was no wind and I shot a couple under today. I don't mind both. The course is in good shape. If they put the pins -- a couple of holes it was into the wind and they had the tees up. I don't really mind what the weather is like. 

 Q. You're tied with Ernie Els at 7-under, possibly you'll be playing with him tomorrow; is that something you'll look forward to?
 TED OH: Yeah, he's playing great. So I want to know why he's Top-10 player in the world and it would be great for me to play with him. 

 Q. Any practise today?
 TED OH: Yeah, I'm going to go over there and try to practise some lag putts. I'm having a hard time reading the greens, but it's okay.
