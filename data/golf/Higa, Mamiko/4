MAMIKO HIGA: Putting is the best thing.  Maybe speed is matched with my putting style.   
 Q.  Why do you think the course is so suitable for you?  
MAMIKO HIGA: It's got wide fairways.  (Inaudible) Once you get in the green and just going -- it's a lot of tricky holes -- so some easy holes and some tricky holes.  So having fun right now playing these holes.
