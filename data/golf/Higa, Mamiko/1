 Q.  Very disappointing with your finish?  
MAMIKO HIGA: Yeah, I wouldn't say I play good, so it was a little regret.   
 Q.  What were you having troubles with?  
MAMIKO HIGA: Shot wasn't accurate enough compared with the last three days.   
 Q.  The fact that you were in contention at the Women's Open, did that cause more stress for you, and was that hard to overcome, to play well?  
MAMIKO HIGA: It wasn't stress for me.  I really enjoyed the tournament.   
 Q.  What do you take away from the week and the experience of being in contention in a Major here in the states?  
MAMIKO HIGA: I really proud to play this kind of tournament, a big tournament, organization and everything.  I learned a lot, a big lesson, and this experience will bring back to Japan, and I got more games to play this year.  So it's going to be a good experience.   
 Q.  Congratulations.
