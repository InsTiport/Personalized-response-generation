 Q.  Mamiko, are you a leaderboard watcher?  When you're playing, do you watch the leaderboard or just pay attention to what's in front of you?  
MAMIKO HIGA: Keep watching.   
 Q.  On the back nine, you made some bogeys, lost some ground.  What were you thinking when that happened?  
MAMIKO HIGA: I wasn't supposed to get bogey on the 9th.  It wasn't a difficult hole, so that was a turning point that I got bad rhythm.   
 Q.  In the lead to start the day, and now you're going to catch up.  What do you have to do to get the lead back?  
MAMIKO HIGA: Recovery is going to be the key, so I'm going to eat well and sleep well and recover well.  So I'm going to fill up my tank to full.  Tomorrow morning, I'm going to stand up on the tee ground freshened, fully recovered.   
Thank you so much.
