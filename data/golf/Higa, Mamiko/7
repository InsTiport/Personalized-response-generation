Q. How did you feel today?  What was the atmosphere like out there?
MAMIKO HIGA: It was a good start with the birdie, but the last half wasn't my rhythm.
Q. How do you think you'll be feeling tomorrow when you get to the first tee?
MAMIKO HIGA: For me, this is the first time playing in this position, so I don't know anything about this experience.  So it's going to be a new experience, but I'm just going to do my best and maintain my condition and just give it a shot.
Q. What has this week as a whole been like for you?
MAMIKO HIGA: Fun.  Just fun.  You know, playing different courses, compared with the Japanese courses and the different views, I'm just enjoying this whole tournament.
