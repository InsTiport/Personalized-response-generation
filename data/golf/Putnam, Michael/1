Q. Let's first start off with that bunker play at 18.  That was a sweet little shot.  You showed some great touch.MICHAEL PUTNAM: That's gotta be best of the day, right?  I'll bet a few people have been in that bunker and not really got that close.  Yeah, I hit a perfect shot.  Everybody was looking.  Obviously the wind was in my favor, but, yeah, it was a great shot.Q. You and Brooks both played well, you're both at 12-under.  Did you kind of feel the momentum off of each other?MICHAEL PUTNAM: Yeah, we just played solid, we hit solid shots, a lot of greens, two-putting and making a birdie here and there.  Yeah, I mean it was a tough day today with the wind, and to get to 12 under is a pretty good score.Q. Tomorrow the wind is supposed to blow again.  I don't know what David's going to wind up being, but you're going to be right there with a chance.  What do you think about tomorrow?MICHAEL PUTNAM: Yeah, I can't wait.  Would obviously love to win the tournament.  If not me, I know a lot of Canadians will be rooting for David tomorrow.  So it should be a good finish and (inaudible).Q.

Yeah, I mean, what a course for what a good finish.  Obviously a lot of birdies and eagles coming home, and scores can change quickly for sure.
