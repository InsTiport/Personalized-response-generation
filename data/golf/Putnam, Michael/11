Q.   Obviously you're where you want to be.   Maybe not the start you wanted today, but you were able to right the ship in a hurry.   What was the key to that?
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   Yeah.   Start for both Scott and I was pretty bad.   You know, call it nerves, call it whatever you want. 
The course has changed a lot from yesterday, especially for me, playing at 7 a.m. and then playing at 2 p.m. today.   It got a lot firmer and faster.   So I made a few bogeys and hit some weird shots and figured it out and made some birdies.

Q.   Is that kind of part of the maturation process that maybe when you're a little bit younger, you start like that and you start to press but now you can put it behind you much quicker and then go on to score the kind of round that you did?
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   Yeah.   I think if I did this eight years ago, I would have probably thrown in a round of 75.   But stay parent.   You know, played here a bunch now, I knew there was a lot of birdies to be made, and I made some. 

Q.   How do you feel about going into tomorrow now? 
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   Yeah.   I feel good.   Like everyone says, today you can't win a tournament but you can lose one.   And I think I have a great chance to win tomorrow, being right there just two strokes back.

Q.   What do you do on Sunday morning now that you have a really late tee start in the final round?
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   Yeah.   I got two kids in the hotel room.   I got like 8:30 wake up, 9:00 breakfast, couple change of diapers.   Nothing special.
