Q. I know that 67 probably felt like it could have been a little bit lower today the way you took advantage of the par-5's but to follow-up 63 with that round you have to be pretty pleased.
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   It was a good day.   Got off to a good start, which is always tough after a low round.   Even starting with this 10th shot here at Palmer it's pretty nerve wracking. 
But I'm pretty happy.   Today I probably just missed two or three 10-footers that I made yesterday, or else it would have been a 65, 64.

Q. Talk about the putting a little bit.   I was noticing your putter out there and the way that you got it shafted with the graphite down to the heel there.   What's the feel like with that putter and what have you sort of tweaked to get it to where you like it?
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   So I got this new BiMatrix shaft that Odyssey is making.   And I'm a pretty tall guy and my putter is 37 inches.   Once you start getting past 35 inches the putter gets heavy with the normal steel shaft.
So they customized this little BiMatrix shaft to keep the putter the same weight as what a regular putter would be and it seems to be working pretty good.

Q. Mentally, this year, on the PGA TOUR, to have that 63 yesterday, get out there today, you took advantage of the scoring holes, but you saw those 10-footers missed.   Where were you in your head today during the course of that round?
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   Yeah, it was pretty good.   Obviously, I wished I could have made a couple of those 10-footers, a couple were kind of big breakers and then one was I hit the edge of the hole. 
It's golf.   You can't make every putt.   I think that obviously Patrick Reed, last year, went like 9-under, 9-under, 9-under, but that's tough to do.   So I'll take 67 today and then get on it tomorrow.
