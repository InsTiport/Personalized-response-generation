Q.   Great playing today and obviously I heard you talking about how well you've been playing this week.   If you could, just some comments about your round today. 
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   I was 5‑under the first nine holes yesterday.   I finished Pebble front nine 6‑under my last or front nine, which is my last nine.   So, in between rounds I shot 59.   Which is pretty cool. 
Playing good, playing solid.   I was 3‑over after my first nine at Pebble yesterday.   Now I'm what, 10‑under? 

Q.   What happened to get that?
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   Hit a couple shots close and made a few putts and got the confidence rolling and just started making putts.   We were lucky to be one of the first groups out today, the greens were rolling pure and I hit a couple close and made a couple long ones and it added up to a 64.

Q.   Then you're playing Spyglass tomorrow, is that correct?
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   Um‑hum.

Q.   If you could, just some thoughts about that and what you think you need to do tomorrow to keep it going. 
MICHAEL PUTNAM:   Yeah, I love Spyglass.   Obviously probably one of the harder courses of the three.   But I'm looking forward to playing.   It's in perfect condition.   Obviously we have great conditions out here.   There's guys that shot good numbers out there.   I looked at the scores a little bit, so looking forward to a good day with James and my partners and roll another 5‑ or 6‑under.
