  Q. You shot a 67 today, tied for the day for the low score.   
 HAL SUTTON: I played solid today. I didn't play very good yesterday on the front nine, I played better on the back nine. But today I played real solid. Hit it in the fairway and on the green and made a few putts.  
  
  Q. The course play different today?  
 HAL SUTTON: It was much dryer, but it's still very wet. At least we weren't hitting out of casual water every shot like we were yesterday.  
  
  Q. The lead is 11, do you have a chance?  
 HAL SUTTON: Probably not, but you know, we'll go keep trying to shoot low.
