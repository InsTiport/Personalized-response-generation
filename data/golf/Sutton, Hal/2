 Q.   Walk me through how you felt today with the conditions.   
HAL SUTTON:   It was very tough.   
   
 Q.   What about where you stand going into tomorrow, getting to play in the morning.   How do you feel about your position?  
HAL SUTTON:   Well, I wish I was a few shots better than I am, but it could have been worse.   And hopefully we'll get some better weather tomorrow where it's not blowing 25 or 30 tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   What's your strategy tomorrow?   What are you looking to improve upon from today's round?  
HAL SUTTON:   I don't know.   I'm just trying to drive it in the fairway and get it on the green and get some of these God awful putts that they got here.
