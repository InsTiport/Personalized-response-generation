HAL SUTTON: Started on 10 and first birdie came at 14, the par 5, I hit driver, driver
right in front of the green chipped it about a foot. 15, I hit 4-wood on the green about
25 feet, made it. 17, I hit 7-iron about ten feet, made it. 1, I hit a little lob wedge in
there about a foot. 2, I hit a pitching wedge about twelve feet, made that. 4, hit it left
of the green there, par 5 in two and hit kind of a weak wedge shot in there about 18 feet,
made the putt.

Q. You were talking out there about swing changes you are working on. What are you
trying to do?

HAL SUTTON: Not really changes. I just -- I worked harder on staying in my spine angle
longer and sometimes you get a little lax in that and it is easier to come out of it and I
don't think that is what I was doing - I was hitting some shots left because of it - not
hitting iron shots as accurately as I should have. So I worked on that last week and seems
to be paying off.

Q. What were the conditions like out there?

HAL SUTTON: He said the wind didn't come early, but we played about -- I was in the
fourth group off; by the time we got to No. 5 the wind was up. A little unlike yesterday,
they played in no wind yesterday morning. I am kind of hoping that wind stays up otherwise
they get a big advantage because we played in it yesterday afternoon too.

Q. Is it affecting shots much?

HAL SUTTON: Sure, it is. Quite a lot.

Q. Can you say how difficult it is?

HAL SUTTON: I think it is playing quite a bit more difficult today. Tough pins that are
going to get hard to get out there. They were hard for us to get to this morning and the
greens were soft. As the wind keeps blowing all day long, greens get a little bit firmer,
they are going to be harder to get to.

Q. You see those pins, they don't want us going that low again (inaudible) --

HAL SUTTON: This is the PGA TOUR, man, they are going to find edges. I expect them to
do that. I was a little surprised yesterday at a couple of the tees. Tees were up a little
bit yesterday on a few holes that I was surprised about. They didn't have them up today.
They had them all back, soÃ¢ï¿½ ¦..

Q. You obviously have been an accomplished player for a long time, but what do you
think your performance of the Ryder Cup last September -- what did that do for you in
terms of confidence boost, things like that, playing so well that week?

HAL SUTTON: Well, I was happy to have played well that week, but, you know, I won the
week before the tournament started there. I took the week off before the Ryder Cup and won
at the Canadian Open, so I was playing good before I went to the Ryder Cup. A lot of
people want to say that was a big confidence boost, all that sort of stuff, I went there
expecting to play good. I felt like my game was really good and I was excited about being
on that team after a 12-year absence of being off of that team. I was very motivated to
play. So I guess in a roundabout way, it didn't hurt my confidence, but I felt like I was
playing good before I went in there.

Q. Is the following of the Ryder Cup becoming so much bigger than you noticed it
afterwards that had gotten a lot of attention and it was a big deal to people?

HAL SUTTON: Well, yeah. After the U.S. started getting beat, the attention towards the
Ryder Cup was much greater because both sides expected to win or wanted to win. So, yeah,
the following of the Ryder Cup has got a pretty good size fan base.

Q. You noticed that when you went to other tournaments afterwards people --

HAL SUTTON: Everyday there somebody mentions the Ryder Cup to me everyday, yep. I can't
tell you how many times I have had somebody holler out thanks for the Ryder Cup. It is a
neat feeling in that regard. People are appreciative.

Q. You talked here last here you came close to hanging it up there for a while. You
were frustrated with your game. How close did you actually come to quitting and how did
you reflect back on that now the way your career --

HAL SUTTON: I will never forget that down time, you know, I don't know how close I was
to quitting. I didn't quit; that is the only thing I could say.

Q. I wonder how much deeper the middle of the field is now than when you started
playing the Tour 20 years ago, if the cut this week might be a few under par, what do you
think when you first came out on Tour, the same weather, but if the players were from the
early '80 what might the cut have been here?

HAL SUTTON: That is hard to put a number on it. I am not sure, you know, the players
are better, the equipment is better, the golf courses are better, all of that equates to
lower scores. The depth of the Tour is certainly much better than it was whenever I first
came out here in the early '80s. But I don't really don't know what the cut would have
been then. That is hard to say. It would have probably been a couple of shots higher so --
is that a fair assessment? That is probably not the exact answer you are looking for, but
I don't know it. I am not God, I can't pull that score out.

Q. How can you tell the depth is greater?

HAL SUTTON: More players that, I think, have a chance to win. There are a lot more
players that they get in front of you that you think it is harder to beat them. Back then,
there weren't as many players that if they got in front of you would be worried about it.

Q. Your confidence back then, that wasn't -- you weren't that confident back then that
you didn't think there were many that can beat you?

HAL SUTTON: There are just more players, yeah. I don't think my confidence has ever
been higher than it is right now, so -- and I still know there is a lot of players out
there that can sure beat me if I let my skirt fly up.

Q. Confidence, is that something that is just built on itself or where is it coming
from?

HAL SUTTON: Well, every time you see a drive going in the middle of the fairway and
every time you see an iron go where you want it to be and every time you see that ball go
in that hole like a rabbit going to his little burrowing hole, that cut-off level keeps
raising up, that bar keeps raising up. That is not just for me. That is for every player
in this field, you know, that is what builds confidence.

Q. The attention that you still get because of the Ryder Cup, is that something that
you still enjoy or do you wish people would get on with it; start talking about more
modern things?

HAL SUTTON: No. I am thrilled every time somebody says something to me about it because
it was a lot of fun to be part of. I have won 11 tournaments on the Tour and a lot of
other ones in amateur golf and nothing measures up to that week in my mind. That is my
greatest moment in golf. It is okay for people sharing in that moment with me.

Q. You already have the date marked down for the next one?

HAL SUTTON: Playing hard right now trying to make the next team. Right now we have got
The Presidents Cup team coming up though. So that comes first.
