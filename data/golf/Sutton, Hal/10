Q.  Talk about your feelings right now.
HAL SUTTON:  This is golf.  If you play this game long enough, you want to win badly, but you understand that losing is part of it, also.  If you play the game of golf, you understand that.  At an international competition like this, it's turned into a spectacle, you know.  And there is a lot of pressure on these guys, and the guys that can handle the pressure perform the best.

We just never got the charisma going that we needed.  We caught glimpses of it yesterday morning.  We started out spectacular the first two hours of today.  People were wondering, you know, are the Americans going to do it again?  And then all of a sudden, we lost it again.

But the truth is, the Europeans were the best players this week.  They played well, but the other side of the truth is that there will be another one in two years.
Q.  If you could do it again, would you do anything differently?
HAL SUTTON:  You know what?  Second-guessing is a golfer's biggest problem.  We cannot second-guess what we did.  We've got to live in the present.  I made mistakes.  I take full responsibility for the mistakes that I made.  I thought there was no bad way to pair the guys we had.

Obviously the pairings that we sent out didn't create any charisma.  But we might have paired it the way you liked it and we might have the same outcome.  So I'm going to live with it.  I'm going to move on.  I'm going to hug my kid tomorrow and everything will be great.
