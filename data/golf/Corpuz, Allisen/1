Q. First day in the books out here.  How do you feel day one all wrapped up?
ALLISEN CORPUZ: Definitely wasn't my best, but I was hitting good shots.  Hitting some pretty good putts, too.
So just try to improve tomorrow.
Q. How does it change now that you've sort of gotten that initial -- I know you said this is the biggest stage you've been on.  Do you think tomorrow you'll be a bit calmer nerves-wise?
ALLISEN CORPUZ: Definitely I was nervous on like the first few holes.  So, yeah, I would definitely hope that I'm more comfortable tomorrow.  Yeah, it was an a good today.
Q. This wind.  Not anybody's friend today, huh?
ALLISEN CORPUZ: No, it was crazy.  I backed off of a couple shots.  It's usually not this windy when I play out here, so it was a little new.
It was tough out there.
Q. How did you adjust when it's this blustery out here?
ALLISEN CORPUZ: I was just really trying to commit to shots for the most part.  Just knowing like you have to maybe aim 20 yards right of the pin to get the results that you want and really committing to that.
Q. Overall experience playing through the frustration and wind and all that aside, did you ever have to like look around and pinch yourself and say, I can't believe I'm doing this right now?
ALLISEN CORPUZ: Definitely.  I mean, it's crazy to be out here.  It's definitely been like one of my biggest dreams to play on the LPGA someday.  Just being out here today was just trying to enjoy the experience.
Q. Dad caddie for you today?
ALLISEN CORPUZ: Yes, he did.
Q. What was it like for you to share that with your father?
ALLISEN CORPUZ: Well, he's always my caddie, so definitely helped with nerves.  I am really comfortable with him on the bag and it's really a special experience.
Q. That double bogey on the turn, how do you recover from that?  How does that affect you going into the final nine holes?
ALLISEN CORPUZ: For me, that double, I felt like it wasn't really bad shots.  It was like I ended up in the wrong place, and so I was just telling myself I have nine more holes.  I can get it back together.
