 Q. First of all, congratulations on that 1-up victory over Matt Kuchar. As we walked off the green you said it was hard work?
 JEEV SINGH: It was hard work. I think it was a fantastic match today. It started off not too good on the first, but came back pretty good. 
 Matt came back strong and birdied 14, 15, and I made some good up-and-downs on 16 and 17 and the last was an exciting one.

 Q. You have to be proud of the way you ground it out and the putts you made to keep this thing ahead?
 JEEV SINGH: Yes, for sure, I ground it out, and I think that's what match play is all about. 
 You can't lose your patience, and you have to hole those short putts and that's what I did today.

 Q. You're into the 16, good luck tomorrow. 
 JEEV SINGH: Thank you.
