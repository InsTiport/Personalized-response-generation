  Q.  A birdie on the last must be pleasing especially with the way you started the back nine?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  I struggled on the back nine. Played rock solid for first nine holes. Wheels fell off on the 10th hole. Found the bunker off the tee and couldn't get it on the green. Got into another greenside bunker and needed two shots to get out before two putting for a double bogey. Overall I'm happy. It was a tough day; the conditions were not easy. I will take one-under.   
  
  Q.  How was it different between the nines?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  On the back nine, I missed it on the wrong side on a few holes and had no chance. Should have been a bogey on the 10th honestly and then missed it on the wrong side on 17 and made bogey. That's what golf is all about.   
  
  Q.  Seven shots back, what will you aim for tomorrow?   
  MILKHA SINGH:  Just go out there and give it my best shot. I'll be aggressive tomorrow and make as many birdies as possible. But on this course, you have to be smart and aggressive. I'm not driving it that good but I'll give it a go.
