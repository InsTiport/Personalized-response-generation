 Q. Jeev, nice round, nice start. 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yeah, it was pretty good. I'm pretty happy. I played solid today. A few errant drives and cost me a bogey, like on the par 3, hit it left and bogeyed that. Then on No. 1, I hit a bad drive, so just kick it out take your medicine and otherwise, rock solid, six birdies.
 I think I need to work on my driver misses, but still in play, even on a windy day like this. 

 Q. What are conditions like? Rough is pretty high. 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: The rough is pretty tough, and also the wind. The wind, you have to have distance control and you have to make sure when it's downwind, you have to miss the ball short of the green and let it run up and you have to get lucky with the bounce. So it's basically that kind of golf today.

 Q. Pleased with the season so far, win in Austria and a couple close calls, as well?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yeah, I'm pretty happy with the way I've played. I'm striking it well, and I think I've just got to focus more on the process and routine and not get results-oriented and everything else is great again.

 Q. Some big weeks coming up, this week, and Birkdale just a few weeks?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yeah, hopefully get into that tournament, and if I play well this week and get in there, love to do that, and then go on to the US PGA championship. So a few good tournaments coming up.
