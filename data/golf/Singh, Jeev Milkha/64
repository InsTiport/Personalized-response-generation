 Q.  Jeev, I think you've set up a very exciting finish tomorrow with McDowell. 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  Yeah, McDowell played really well, too, today except he had a little bad luck on the last.  But I think for the first -- we brought the best out of each other on the golf course.  He made a lot of birdies on the start and I came back and also made a few birdies.  I think it was a good game out there today and I think both of us took advantage of the weather.  The weather was perfect. 

 Q.  The blemish was the bogey on No. 12? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  Yes, I made nine birdies today with one bogey on No. 12.  That was a 3-putt.  Pretty happy the way I conducted myself and handled it on the golf course. 

 Q.  How is the flu? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  It better but not 100 per cent.  I also have a sore foot but we've got the physios out here and they are taking care of me and trying to make the most out of it. 

 Q.  Five birdies in a row, what was going through your mind? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  I wasn't even thinking about it.  I was just hitting on the green and hitting it close enough and making those putts.  I made five birdies, and I was just trying to hit it close enough and get it on the green.  It was just momentum. 
 I knew I made a few birdies, but you just keep going.  It's good that you reminded me that I made five birdies. 

 Q.  Will you be feeling more pressure sharing the lead? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  Not really.  I had a good round today.  Sharing the lead, I think you're in a good position.  You know, the best may win, whoever handles himself better tomorrow and I'm happy with my position now. 

 Q.  What about the fact you've got three Irish guys chasing you for the title? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  They have got experience, and it's good to have competition.  I'm just going to go out there tomorrow and just see what comes my way. 

 Q.  The routine, I remember you talking about when you won the Volvo, how much it meant to you and you said last week it got away from you; does that prey on you in your thinking process and routine? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  It does, it helps me play better.  Obviously I got out of my routine the last three holes and I paid for it in Jakarta.  I started thinking about finishing instead of just letting it happen. 
 I played pretty good at Jakarta.  I'm happy about that.  I let it go, but that's fine, it's all part of learning.  I should have been more focused on my process and routine than anything else the last few holes. 

 Q.  Having played with Graeme 18 holes today, what aspect of your game do you think you'll have advantage tomorrow? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  This golf course, it all comes down to putting.  I think whoever holds and get the putting going early, and also when he needs it on the golf course the last few holes, I think that's what it's going to come down to.  I think driving is a key also but basically you can get away with a 3-wood, also.  But mainly I think it's all going to come down to putting. 

 Q.  Why do you think Indian golf is so good now? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  I think we've got a good local tour in place, and I think the professional golfers now understand that they can compete with the top players, but they have seen us guys do well.  They obviously believe that if these guys can do it, why not us, and that's the attitude they have. 
 I think in the near future, you're going to see a lot more guys doing much better now.
