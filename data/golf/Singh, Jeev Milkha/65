  Q.  Apart from that double bogey before the turn, you did pretty well?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I played pretty good today. I haven't been keeping too well after my accident last week in the pro-am. I had a little bit of concussion, I fell out of the cart and haven't been feeling too good after that.   
We saw the tree going and I told my caddie to brake but instead of braking, he pressed the accelerator and we hit it head on. I held on the chair but the chair actually came up, hit my back, I went flying through the windscreen, hit my head and lucky the windscreen was plastic and not glass, if not I wouldn't know what would have happened. I hit the palm tree and fell out. I was trying to balance myself and I think I took a lot of my weight from my wrist.   
The only thing I was thinking about that time was my Masters. I thought I broke my wrist but my wrist was fine and my head wasn't too good.   
I was under observation for 24 hours. They said that I've to watch myself but everything is under control. But after that as the week started, I got the flu and I haven't been feeling good. Still have the flu and I hope that I can get out of it.   
It wasn't a good week last week but it's a new week and I had a good start. That's all that matters now.   
  
  Q.  Tell us more about your round today?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  There was no expectation out there and I was only thinking of finishing the round. I kept going and played pretty good except I had a bad break at the 18th. I had a bad lie but I had to go for the green. I had a three iron and I put it in the hazard and made a double.
