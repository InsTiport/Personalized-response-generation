  Q. Jeev, your first time here at Sedgefield. You must like this place.  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: It's my third time. I do like it. Last year I had a good showing here and I've had a good start to the week. I like the golf course the way it's set-up, suits my game and I like playing here.  
  
  Q. Great round in the opening round. It's usually tough to follow one with another good one but you had a nice, solid second.  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes. I hit some good putts. Didn't hole as many putts as yesterday. I'm happy with the way I'm playing and I'm looking forward to the weekend.  
  
  Q. Conditions different today than yesterday?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes. It was windy today and lot of long lines into some par-4s, especially against the wind. Overall, I think I'm happy with the game and I think the course played tougher than yesterday for sure.  
  
  Q. Do you think it will play even tougher as the day goes on?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I think so if the wind picks up. The wind is swirling and it's tough between the trees to get the right yardage out here.  
  
  Q. We've had some guys go really low and some guys put up some big numbers in the first two rounds. Kind of under the radar might be a good place to be. You're kind of lurking, right there.  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yeah. I like the way I'm placed right now. Two good solid rounds. Hopefully it will do the trick.  
  
  Q. Good luck to you this weekend.  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Thank you.
