  Q.  Regarding his first Masters experience.   

 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  I'm enjoying every bit of it.  You don't enjoy the 3-putts or the balls rolling off the greens, but you just have to be patient.  I'm enjoying every bit of it.   

 Birdieing the last hole leaves a better taste in my mouth.  I didn't have the speed on the green today.  I guess I have to work on my putting.  Although I made a big putt on 1 and a good putt on 18.   
  
  Q.  What makes Augusta different than the other courses?   

 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  It is the greens and the test of patience.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel about making the cut?   

 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  It is a great feeling.  I feel like I handled myself well.  I have the next two days to see what I can do.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the weather conditions.   

 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  I love playing in the cold.  I have played in the European TOUR for years.  I'm more comfortable playing in the cold.  I like to play in the wind too.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the two drivers like Mickelson.   

 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  It is perfect for me.  Like on No. 1, if I was to use one of my drivers and hit it right, I'm dead.  I'm dead in that bunker.  I often use the other driver and hit it right off the deck (the ground.)   

One driver is a TaylorMade 1994 bubble shaft, nine degree loft.  The other is a Callaway 16 degree.  It's an older model and I have three at home in my closet.
