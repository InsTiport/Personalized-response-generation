 Q. You managed to take down a three-time Major Champion and one of the favorites to win this tournament?
 JEEV SINGH: It was a great. At the end of the day in match play, it all comes down to who holes more putts, and I was lucky enough to do that.

 Q. Was there any sense at the start of the week it was going to be a special one for you?
 JEEV SINGH: You always come out here thinking that it's going to be better. So this time was lucky for me. 
 I got through the first round, and I'm looking forward to my second round match.

 Q. You were in India last week and missed the cut. A long journey here, how your feeling?
 JEEV SINGH: It was good, in fact, I got over the jet lag. I got here on Saturday. Whatever happens, happens for a reason. I take it it was so I can get over the jet lag. 
 My coach and I have worked hard the last few days.

 Q. You play someone like Padraig that's ranked higher than you, what's the mindset as you go out?
 JEEV SINGH: I try to follow my routine and stay in the process and work on my rhythm. It was a lot of pressure on me, and I tried to save pars when I can and I did that today.

 Q. How is being a dad?
 JEEV SINGH: Excellent. It's one of the best rounds of my life so far on the 29th of Jan.
