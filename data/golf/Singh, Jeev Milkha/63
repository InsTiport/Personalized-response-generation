 Q.  Disappointing finish but a good week? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  Yes, I think I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Obviously you play to win but somebody has to win.  McDowell played really good.  The last hole he hit a great shot in there after I hit a good shot, and I think the best man won. 

 Q.  That playoff was remarkable.  That par that you sunk for par at the end and then dare say what looked like an easy one. 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  Yes, but that's golf.  I gave it a good shot and look forward to next week. 

 Q.  Doral next week is a wonderful bonus? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  Yeah, going to play Doral next week, and I gave it a good effort this week.  Would like to congratulate McDowell for playing excellent golf, and looking forward to Doral because I'm playing well. 
 So maybe there's something better waiting for me there. 

 Q.  And then on to the Masters? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  Yes, the week is over, got to look forward to something better. 

 Q.  Despite the aches and pains, a smile on your face? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  Yeah, I gave it a good effort.  I gave it 100%, but I tried my best.
