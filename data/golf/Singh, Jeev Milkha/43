 Q. Tell me, 5-under. 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I played pretty good today. I made five birdies, no bogeys. Whenever you don't make a bogey on a golf course, I think you should be pleased. So I'm pleased. 
 Holed a good putt on last for a par, that was like a 12-footer, and that leaves a good taste in the mouth. 

 Q. How did you find the golf course?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Excellent. I think quite different from yesterday. I think that's the way I'm going to putt it. The wind was -- yesterday, I think they are going to cancel the round, but yesterday it was so cold. But it was nice weather today. I think if you're playing in the morning, you should take advantage of it, because you know, it's completely a different golf course without the breeze. 

 Q. What have you been up to?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I am playing more in the U.S. than anywhere else. It's going pretty good, I finished fourth in the CA Championship, so focusing quite a bit in the U.S. this year. I'm going to play about 15 events there and I'm going to play about 15, 16 out here, too. So that's what I plan to do. 
 That's what I would like to do; I've won on every tour and I would like to win there, too. I'm still going to play here. I won't give this up. I want to be a global player. 
 Even if I do well in the U.S., I'm still going to come back and in Europe and play. In today's day and age, if you're a global player, I think it makes you a better player, too. 

 Q. What's next in terms of Europe? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I'm going to play Wales, week off, U.S. Open, come back for French, Scottish, British and then I'll head back to the U.S. I'm going to play Buick, Bridgestone, PGA, then come back for Crans.
