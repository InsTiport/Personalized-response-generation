 Q. That round included five 3s coming home. I think you'll take that any day of the week, wouldn't you? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Oh, yes, I would. I had a bad start. Made a good birdie on No. 9 and I think the best birdie of the day was on No. 10, and that got me going, and after that I just started hitting the ball better and rolled the putter well and pretty happy with the back nine.

 Q. You're in contention to win first prize tomorrow, but obviously of prime concern to you as well is bagging that last qualifying spot for Royal Birkdale. How important is that to you?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: It is very important. Obviously I'm going to try tomorrow to play well and hopefully that spot comes to me. But there are a lot of players who are there right now, like Simon Khan and other guys who are not exempt, and I'm going to try tomorrow to shoot a good number and hopefully get there to The Open Championship.

 Q. What would it mean to you to get there? Why is it of prime importance to you?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Playing a major championship is always important for a player, and for me especially, playing The Open Championship, it's got history and it's the oldest championship and I would love to be there with the best players.
