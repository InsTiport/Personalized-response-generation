  Q. What were your expectations coming in?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: No expectations. I was just trying to hit shot-by-shot and hope that I can shoot even par and it worked out pretty good. I shot 2-under.   
  
  Q. A lot has been made of the challenges of the par 3s on this course, Jeev, how would you sum up how they played today?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Tough. And I was fortunate enough to play the par 3s well today. Especially the 17th hole, I birdied so, that was good.   
  
  Q. How difficult is 9?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: 9 is a test of patience I think, with that flag today. If you want to be gutsy, you can go for the flag, but I played for the middle of the green and tried to make my two putts and take a 3 on that and move on.   
  
  Q. What's your attitude toward Tiger not being in a given field at a particular championship?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Tiger's always up there, and you know, obviously we're going to miss Tiger, and he's done a lot for golf worldwide.   
  
  Q. Does 2 give you a chance to score here every day; the eagle today, is that available all the time?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: No, it's not. You've got to hope that you get a good bounce. You're trying to hit a good shot, but you hopefully get a good bounce because the greens are really slopey and I got a good bounce, and it was perfect and ended up about five feet from the hole on No. 2 today.
