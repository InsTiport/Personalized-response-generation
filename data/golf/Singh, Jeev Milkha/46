  Q. How do you feel about a closing round of 70?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Could have done better but I'm happy with my performance today. Those boys up front were superb and were way past us after nine holes so I just thought, hang in there and try and make the most out of my day so I'm happy with a 70.  
  
  Q. You made a fantastic amount of birdies this week but perhaps just one or two too many bogeys?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH Yes I think that's right. I made too many bogeys and too many errant shots to contend but that is part of the game. I holed some putts I wasn't supposed to so I will definitely take fourth place here, one of my best finishes in the US so I have to be happy with that.  
  
  Q. This is your best finish in a Major or a WGC event, how satisfying is that?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I know that if I could finish top ten in the PGA Championship and top four in a WGC event, I feel in the future that I could do even better.
