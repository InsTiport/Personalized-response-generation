Q. Good round?
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   I played really well the first 11 holes.   I think 12th hole was the hole that I think got me‑‑ not the 12th, sorry, the 13th.   I hit a bad shot, and I think I got greedy with it.   When you hit it in the rough you need to take your medicine and move on.   I made a double there but came back with a birdie on the next and made some good pars coming in.
And I think I've just got to stay patient.   I'm happy.   I've come away with a 70.   I thought I could have done much better.   But it's all right and I look forward to the next three days.

Q.   Can you talk about the rough? 
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Yes, rough is tough, for sure.   I was in the rough on the last three holes.   I was 1‑under par playing the 16th.   I thought I could drive it on for sure.   I just pushed the driver a bit too much.   And I think if the wind is the same tomorrow or the next three days, I would go for it and see what comes my way and take it from there.

Q.   What did you make of the weather? 
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   I think we're very lucky with the weather, honestly.   No wind today.   I think it's a bonus, and that's why when you have an early tee time, you go out there and try to make the most out of it.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   I think it's fantastic and it's a joy for me.   And I'm a very fortunate man to be playing this week after last week.   And I'm just going to enjoy this week.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Oh, yes, for sure.   I was going to get lower.   But like I said, there was a hiccup on No. 13, but that's fine, it happens.   And, you know, take it from there.   But the good part is I came back with a birdie on the next and I was aggressive on the next few holes.   That's my way of playing and it didn't go my way, but it will come my way the next three days.

Q.   Did you notice after a few holes yourself moving up the leaderboard? 
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Yes, I did, I did.   It was good to see.   And hopefully we can carry on that form.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Yes, I just played six holes.   I like to play the golf course blind.   I think that's why I paid my dues on No. 13, but that's all right.   It could have gone my way, and it couldn't have, too, but that's all right.   It's okay.   That's the way I like playing coming into a tournament.   I think mentally I was a little tired so I just wanted to take it easy.   So I just played six and I just saw a few holes and I walked in. 

Q.   Anything you would have done differently out there? 
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Maybe a few holes I would have been more aggressive on because I like to be‑‑ I'm an aggressive player.   But that's fine.   I've learned from today, and tomorrow I'll go out and see how it plays.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Oh, yes, I think I'm very happy with the putting, one chip‑in, a lot of putts, and, you know‑‑ yes, one almost‑chip‑in.   So I'm happy with it.   No complaints.   And look forward to the next three days, honestly.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Yes, yes, for sure I do, but I take it in a way that if you play a lot of practice rounds you see a lot of trouble.   So you might as well not see it, you might as well just tee it up straight and see the good and go for it.   Sometimes it works for me, sometimes it doesn't.   I'm still happy.   I think it worked for me, and I'm going to do the same most of the time. 

Q.   Is it normal for you not to play a practice round?
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Yes, I don't normally.   If I've played a golf course once I won't play a practice round like the last four weeks‑‑ if I'm in the Pro Am that's fine, if I'm not I won't play.   Like last week I didn't play a practice round, I just went straight up because I played the golf course last year.

Q.   Have you played here before? 
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Never before, and that's a big gamble, but I like doing it.

Q.   How much do you rely on Janet?
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Yes, I rely quite a bit on her, because she's walked the course a few times, and I just ask her where to go and just look at the yardage book and fire away.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   13, no‑‑ maybe, yes, I would hit a driver.   I would like to get it close to the green.   And that's what I was thinking today, and I went to the 3‑wood because I just felt that I'm hitting my driver well, I might as well stick to it and go for it.   But we'll see what comes my way tomorrow.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Yes, I want to go with the driver.   I love 15.   16th hole, especially, with the wind, downwind, 16, yeah, it's a drivable par‑4 and I would go for it.   Even if you get it in the bunker I think you've got a shot to the flag. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   Yeah, the first hole was like a 25‑footer I holed for a birdie.
And then No. 3 I holed a long one there, too.   It was about‑‑ what is No. 3?   I'm forgetting the holes?   Par‑4.   Yeah, yeah, par‑4.   No. 4 was‑‑ I made a birdie there.   No. 4 was‑‑ 3 I chipped in.   No. 4 was about, again, 20 feet, holed that.   I made a lot of up‑and‑downs today, you know, and that's what links golf is.   And one day when you hit a lot of fairways and greens, maybe shoot a low one. 
Yes, I saved a lot of good pars.   Especially the last one.   Leave a good taste in the mouth.   I think lunch is going to taste good. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   That was just about four feet.   I hit a good chip.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   17th was about six feet I would have said.

Q.   For your second shot you had to lay up?
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   I had to, there's too much rough and I just said get it over the bunkers, and then after that I hit a good chip, and just I think I hit it too firm on the line.   But that's all right.   It happens.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JEEV MILKHA SINGH:   For sure.   I didn't have a good stance, and I was just trying to get it out, and I said just make your five and move on, take your medicine.   You've hit it here and that's it.   And I just didn't‑‑ the club just went under the ball.
