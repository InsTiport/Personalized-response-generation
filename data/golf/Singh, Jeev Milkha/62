  Q. You must be pleased with today.   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, I drove the ball very well today and hit it to the right places. I'm pretty happy. A few mistakes I think you're allowed on this course, and I'm pretty pleased with my round today.  
  
  Q. Especially including the par-5s, you must be pleased with that.   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, I birdied all the par-5s today, and I had a few chances. But you know, greens are tough. You can't be too aggressive out there. I left some short, but I'm still happy with 1-under par today.  
  
  Q. The 1st hole put you off to a solid start.   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: It was a good par. I holed a 20-foot putt for par that got me going.  
  
  Q. Was the course playing any different today compared to earlier rounds?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, it was. The greens were quicker, a little bit more firm, but you know, you expect that. The course was in excellent condition.   
  
  Q. You've had a good run at the start of the year, and this came just in time for the Masters. Did it create a lift in your confidence, in your attitude for the season ahead?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yeah, for sure. When you get invited to one of the best majors, for me personally, you get a jump start. I'm happy to be here. And after that I was playing well, and things fell in place for me. I had two seconds, should have won, but hey, I'm still here, that's the past, and make the most out of it.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, it was. Under par any day on this golf course is good.  
  
  Q. What's the plan for tomorrow?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Just do the same, follow my process and routine and see what comes my way.  
  
  Q. The one-hour delay this morning, how did you feel about that?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I was relaxed. I just had some breakfast and spent some more time relaxing.  
  
  Q. Were you out on the driving range or the putting green?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I worked on my short game. I went early a little bit. I went about 20 minutes earlier than normal to the driving range and worked on my short game.
