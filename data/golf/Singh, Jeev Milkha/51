 Q. You had another tidy round of golf; was 66 the least you were hoping for today?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: You know, conditions were perfect out there today, not too much of a breeze, and I think that you have to shoot like 2-, 3-, 4-under just to keep yourself in the hunt. I think I've done that and I've still got a chance and looking like I'm two behind right now. Going into the final round, if you're two behind, I think it's not too bad.

 Q. Are you still riding the surf of confidence from last week's win? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, I am, I'm pretty confident and I'm comfortable with the game and the way I'm playing. I'm looking forward to tomorrow and see what comes my way.

 Q. Having played for so long on the Asian Tour and played the Hong Kong Open, it's a favourite tournament of yours; you enjoy the whole atmosphere of this great championship, don't you? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: It's fantastic, a lot of history, the golf course the way it's set up, I think it's fantastic. It needs a lot of thinking and a lot of imagination, and I think that's the beauty of this course and it's in wonderful condition. 

 Q. The big names are all gathering on the leaderboards, aren't they?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, and I think it's fantastic. Anybody from 8-under can take this, and it's going to be a great day tomorrow. Everybody is going to be fired up, and may the best win. 

 Q. No change in your game plan? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yeah, just keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully make some more putts and that's when you get those 63s and 62s. It all comes down to putting.
