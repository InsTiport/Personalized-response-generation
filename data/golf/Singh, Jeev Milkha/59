   JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Played pretty good today, drove the ball well, hit some good putts, just didn't go in. One of those days where you try and you make everything the right way and some of those putts don't go in. But it's all right, I'm still in good position, and see what happens tomorrow. 

 Q. Maybe saving them for tomorrow?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yeah, I hit the ball well and rolled it really well today and I'm pretty happy with the way I played. But one of those days when some putts slip out quite often but that's all right. I've got another day to do something. 

 Q. Not far off the lead, are you? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, I think I'm still in the tournament and if I can have a good it start tomorrow, I think we'll see what happens. 

 Q. Are you a leaderboard watcher? Will you be having a look tomorrow to see exactly where you are? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Maybe after 10, 12 holes, but not before that, and see what the game plan is going to be. Maybe get more aggressive. I am going to be aggressive, but some of the holes where you've got to position, you can't knock yourself out. 

 Q. Depends on the setup, doesn't it. 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yeah, it all depends on the setup and where you can risk and reward plays and what position you are at, and then you go for it.
