  Fourth Round 67. Total 263 (-17)  
   
  Q. Reflect on your final round.   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Played really well again. And I rolled the putter well, too. Just a few close misses, you know. I thought I made those putts, but didn't go in. That's what happens in this game but I'm pretty happy.   
 It was a solid week for me. Shot 17-under; no complaints. Every day, I played solid. I hit 16 greens today and I'm happy going into next week. I had to finish top two to get into The Race to Dubai, didn't do it that, finished seventh. Was a good effort. Looking forward to Japan next week and the Indian Open.   
  
  Q. You had to have a really hot putter to get going, wasn't it?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, I needed a low one today. I tried but didn't go my way but I still hit the ball well. We'll try next week.   
  
  Q. Look back at the whole week, you must have been able to take a lot of positives out?  
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, I've taken a lot of positives. I'm playing well and this is the first time I've shot a score like this this year. So I'm pretty happy and gives me a lot of confidence going into the next two weeks.  
  
  Q. What else do you need to work on apart from the body?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I think I just need to work on my body. Everything else is good.
