  Q.  Those last two birdies must have been important for you?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH:  They were. I started off well and was three under after the 16th, that was my front nine. I need to play the 17th properly. I bogeyed it yesterday and it slowed me down and again today, and I played it conservatively today. But the ball still rolled in the water. I had a six iron and it just kept rolling all the way into the water and I made a bogey. After that I kept making pars, missed a few birdie chances.   
 On the fifth I made a double bogey. Hit it just right and it hit the cart path like yesterday and it went 350 yards right behind a bush. I had no shot, chipped it out sideways. I hit the green but the green is very severe and it ran off, chipped it on and two putted for a double.   
 After that three putted the sixth for a par. All the way coming in I had birdie chances and converted two of them so I am pleased with how I ended the day. There is a lot of golf left, another two days and see what happens.   
 I am three shots back at the moment. The course was there for the taking this morning. It was not that tough, there was no wind and it depends on whether the wind picks up. But there is a lot of golf left.   
  
  Q.  Was it easier playing early?   
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH I think it was harder yesterday afternoon. The breeze was up and it was easier this morning, There were so many birdie chances this morning and if you got the putter going you really had a chance to go deep and Jyoti has done that with a seven under round. That was fantastic and it was there for the taking.
