 Q. After a very poor finish yesterday, how was it to get back into it today?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I was so happy, it was a great start. I holed a great putt on the first hole and eagled it. 
 After that, up and down in between, but came back. I think what got me going on the 12th, I eagled it again. I made two eagles today, so that was good. After that, hit a great shot into 15 to about five feet and holed that for birdie. 
 After that, played well, especially 18. The breeze is so strong and you're hitting a 3-iron in there, and knowing where the green is, I got away with a four, so I'm happy about it. 

 Q. You worked very hard on your putting last week in Las Vegas and you had 79 putts in three rounds and so the work looks like it's paid off. 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, I'm happy with the way everything is going, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow. 

 Q. I know you're very focused and concentrated on the golf course; do you actually look at boards and know where you are in the tournament? 
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: Yes, I was looking at the boards today, checking out how the boards are doing. Especially the 17th, I checked the board out. 

 Q. What would a win in America do for you?
 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: I've won on most of the tours in the world, and I think I would like to win here, too. That would be perfect. That would be the icing on the cake. That's what we work hard for. That's what I want to do one day. I've won in Europe, I've won in Asia, I've won in Japan, and I'd like to win here, too.
