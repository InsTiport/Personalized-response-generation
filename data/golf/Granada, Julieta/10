 Q. Solid day for you:   4 birdies, no bogeys.   Talk about the round over all.   Weather was a little bit different than it is usually here.   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, it was interesting.   Had a whole lot of rain on the front nine, so had to keep our cool and keep being concentrated.  
But I holed out twice two lob shots today, so that was nice.   It was very welcome.  
   
 Q.   Where were those?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   On 4 and 16.  
   
 Q.   How far for both of those?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Just lob shots, maybe 10 yards.  
   
 Q.   Close.   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, like chips.  
   
 Q.   This is your third event this year so far?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   How was the off season?   Make any changes?   Hadn't gone too low the first two events.   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, I actually played really well in Bahamas.   I thought it was really solid.   
Australia was solid as well the first two days.   Just couldn't get anything going on the weekend.   Nothing changed in the off season, it was mainly about getting healthy.  
Last year was sort of an injury year, so it was mainly working out and getting healthy and getting the body strong.   So that was pretty much what I did.   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   What did you have last year?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   I had a hip and a shoulder injury.   Okay.   Both left, so that was not fun.  
   
 Q.   Were they at the same time or different times?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   They came back‑to‑back.   So first it was the hip, around May‑‑ March, April, May and after that it was the shoulder.  
   
 Q.   So one right after the other.  
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, it was tough.   It wasn't hurting enough for me to leave the year and kind of...  
   
 Q.   ...   take off completely.  
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever had injuries like that where you're contemplating taking time off?  
JULIETA GRANADA:   No.   At the beginning it was like, Oh, you might need surgery, and that kind of scared me a little bit.   Thank God everything was good.   I just had to like rehab it a lot.  
You know when you get that far injured, the process is so slow to come back.   So it was just like a drag.   You had to do all the exercises like a million times.  
   
 Q.   What did they say you had?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   On the shoulder I have a cyst that's still there.   Doing rehab and treatment to get it healthy.   
On the hip it was like a little bit of a tear on the hip.  
   
 Q.   Partial?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, but not enough to have surgery.  
   
 Q.   Like just enough you almost wish it was?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Coming into this year, any definitive goals you thought about?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Be more consistent.   But I think if I just stay healthy the whole year that would help.   It was really tough last year trying to concentrate with everything.  
This year I want to stay healthy and committed to all the stuff I have to do outside of golf and then just play golf.  
   
 Q.   How many times have you played here?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Maybe four times.  
   
 Q.   Everyone says the greens are much more receptive and a lot softer than usual.   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, especially today after the rain, right?   Like they got really soft.   Yesterday which got a little bit of roll, which was the nice.  
Overall I like the golf course.   You have to play well and hit good shots.   I did that today.  
   
 Q.   What about the round today that you really want to carry on into the weekend?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, I just stayed really present today.   That was nice.   Just like one shot at a time.   It's very cliche, but those kinds of things work.  
   
 Q.   Mom helping out?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yes, it's been great.   She's the best.
