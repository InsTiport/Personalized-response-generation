  Q. Congratulations, a nice 69 today, can you talk a little bit about your round?   
 JULIETA GRANADA: Yeah, I played well today. You know, I started hitting it very solid and I started on the back nine, which is the harder side. So it built confidence for the front nine, which is my second nine. So I made good putts, and I hit good shots. It was a good combination.  
  
  Q. You won the ADT TOUR Championship, you won $1 million several years back, and we are here again, the season-ending tournament. You're back in Florida playing. Do you feel extra-good about that?  
 JULIETA GRANADA: I don't know, I hope so. I hope there's some magic in Florida for me. You know, I've been practicing here a lot, and I've been working on my game, so you know, it's the last tournament of the year, but I've been really working hard this year. So it's nice to have a good round.   
  
  Q. So you've been practicing here at Grand Cypress?   
 JULIETA GRANADA: Yeah, I am an academy member.   
  
  Q. You are?   
 JULIETA GRANADA: I am. Legally, yeah (laughing).
