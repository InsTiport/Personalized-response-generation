  Q. Is this your first time playing the golf course, the first round?  
 JULIETA GRANADA: My first round. I got back from the U.S. Last night we got to the hotel at 1:30. So I went by the book; the book is pretty good, so it gave me all I needed.  
  
  Q. So good yardages?   
 JULIETA GRANADA: Yeah, for sure. I was hitting it really good, and then on the front nine, which was my back nine, I started putting really well. I only had 11 putts, so that helps.  
  
  Q. How many in total?  
 JULIETA GRANADA: I think 27. So the front nine was definitely the good side.   
  
  Q. So how do you feel about this course? Do you like it?   
 JULIETA GRANADA: I like it. What I saw, I really like it. The greens are really fast which I love, so we'll see tomorrow.   
  
  Q. You haven't seen much of Dubai yet?   
 JULIETA GRANADA: No, literally I saw the airport and the hotel, and that's all I got.   
  
  Q. Did you have some problems getting here with the visa at Frankfurt?   
 JULIETA GRANADA: Yes, they wouldn't let me on the plane. So I had to call the LET and ask if they could fax the visa over so they could let me on the plane. So I literally got on the plane like five minutes before it left.   
 So, it was a little challenging.   
  
  Q. Why wouldn't they let you on the plane, because they didn't think you had the right visa?   
 JULIETA GRANADA: Because I didn't have the visa with me. I didn't have like a printout with me and it was in my computer and I had to get on the Internet and the Internet was really slow and not working. So I could not show her that I had the attachment. So she was like to the buying it. She was like not willing to help me in any way.   
  
  Q. So anything you'll be doing tonight before you get back on the course tomorrow?  
 JULIETA GRANADA: I think I'm just going to go to sleep. I think I'm lacking a little sleep. I actually didn't feel that bad today. I felt pretty good. The jet-lag didn't get to me yet. So tonight, I want to get a good night's sleep, so tomorrow we play early.
