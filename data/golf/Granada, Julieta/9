 Q.   Round of the tournament, run us through it.   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, I just got off to like a really good start.   I birdied 2.   I eagled three3.   I just made some really good putts today, unlike yesterday, so it felt really good.  
   
 Q.   Kind of feel like you're pretty close to into it now, right?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, it was weird yesterday because I took three weeks off, and it was like my timing was a little bit off from tournament golf.   So today I was just trying to get my rhythm, and I think I did that pretty well.  
   
 Q.   The conditions were pretty windy out here today.   Was it just the mindset of just be steady and when you have a chance for birdies, just go for them on some of the par‑5s?   
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah, I mean, definitely here the par‑5s, you have to take advantage of.   They give you a little bit of a break, and, yeah, the course completely changed.   It was dry, it was fast, the greens were super fast, so it was like you had to adjust on the go.
