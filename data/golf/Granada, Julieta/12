 Q.   Okay.   So a good day yesterday and a good day today.   Let's have your reactions from your round.  
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah.   Well, yesterday was very solid.   You know, I made a lot of putts, and it was just a really consistent round.   Today I started bogey, bogey, so it was more of a comeback.   
I had to come back on the front nine, which was my back 9.   So I did a good job.   I think I got a little tired.   Maybe the jet lag kicked in today, but it was a rough start, but I managed to shoot under par today.  
   
 Q.   Yeah, that 30 at the last puts you in a tie for second, 5â€‘under overall.   After two days is this where you were pretty much hoping to be?  
JULIETA GRANADA:   Yeah.   I played really well yesterday.   I was hoping for the same today, but with the first two bogeys it was kind of hard, but I managed to come back, and I'm happy.   
I played very well.   My putting has been really good this week, so I'm looking forward to two more rounds.  
   
 Q.   Do you think this course here suits your style of play?  
JULIETA GRANADA:   Oh, I seem to play really well here, so I enjoyed it.   The last couple of years, the first round I shoot like 11 under in three rounds, so I'm really happy, and I really like the course.   It's beautiful.
