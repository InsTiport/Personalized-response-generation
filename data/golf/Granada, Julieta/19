  Q.  What was it like today?   
 JULIETA GRANADA:  Well, I had six birdies on the first nine holes.  So it was just a birdie-fest.  She was making lots of birdies, I was making lots of birdies.  The last three holes, I hit long clubs into the greens and lost the holes.  Overall I played much better than I've been playing.   
  
  Q.  Was the wind playing a factor?   
 JULIETA GRANADA:  No.  I made some decisions without consulting my mom, and I was confident with the club but it just wasn't enough.  But I did make six birdies on the first nine holes.  I bet anyone I would have won the match.  It's one of those things in match play, just the way it goes.   
  
  Q.  One of the downfalls of match play?   
 JULIETA GRANADA:  Yeah, I could have played 63 other girls and I would have won.  But that's the way it goes.
