  Q.  What Tiger has done --   
 JULIETA GRANADA:  I think being a golfer, it's closer to relate to him.  He's incredible, all of the majors that he won and to come back from a back round, it's something that once-in-a-lifetime and -- inaudible -- generation, learn so much from him and just enjoy.   
  
  Q.  (Inaudible.)   
 JULIETA GRANADA:  I actually started to imitate him a little bit.  Very concentrated -- (Inaudible.)   
 You know, it's because I grew up watching him winning the first major and after that, you know, it was history.   
  
  Q.  Is there anything else that you've taken from his game?   
 JULIETA GRANADA:  Oh, yeah -- that's hard to do after a bad round.   
  
  Q.  He's done it?   
 JULIETA GRANADA:  I know, but with him he it's like -- inaudible -- all the time, when he has a bad round, you're like, wow, this guy is really the whole package.
