   HIROYUKI FUJITA: I don't know exactly what's going on right now but when I saw the TV, it's so disastrous, but I had a team time, so anyway, I need to go and tee off, and I just did it and tried to concentrate on my own play. 

 Q. Is everybody okay in your family?
 HIROYUKI FUJITA: My tee time was 8:30 this morning for the rest of the first round and at that point I didn't know how my family was. But anyway, I needed to go, so I just did it. 
 And after the 6th hole of the front nine, I was told my family was okay.

 Q. Do you have any friends where the epicenter was? Have you been there yourself? Do you have any friends in the area?
 HIROYUKI FUJITA: Actually, I would say no friends, not very close friends. Some people I know but not close friends.

 Q. Have you ever visited there?
 HIROYUKI FUJITA: Well, in the past there was a tournament in that Prefecture called the Miyagi. So once a year I used to go there. But right now there is no tournament in that Prefecture, so I don't go there usually.

 Q. Have you seen the news footage or videos? 
 HIROYUKI FUJITA: Yeah, I did. 

 Q. What's one word that comes to mind when you saw the videos?
 HIROYUKI FUJITA: I couldn't believe it. It is not in this world.
