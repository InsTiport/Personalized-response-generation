 Q. How does it feel to see yourself after today?  
JY KO: I played better today. Too much windy. Two late round tee times. Even played with injury. My caddie, talk to me, every time is to enjoy it. He says to constantly enjoy, enjoy. Concentrate on each shot, one shot at a time.  
First time playing links course. But a lot of experience in Ireland and Korea. There is a windy island, Jeju. First time to Scotland, but I have four victories in Korea, three this year.  
   
 Q. This is your first time in Scotland. You're feeling good obviously?  
JY KO: Here is many weather, sunny, rain and windy. It's fun.  
   
 Q. You like the wind? You like to try special shots into the wind?  
JY KO: Not bad. A little bit, yes. Today is the first time I ever played six hours and a half.
