 Q. So how did it feel out there? Throughout the course and that?
 BOB MCGRATH: Yeah, it was certainly the first time out took a few holes to get adjusted, made a couple mistakes early and battled my way for the rest of the day. So it was hard.

 Q. Was this your first time on this course also?
 BOB MCGRATH: Correct.

 Q. Did you practice at all yesterday?
 BOB MCGRATH: I been here all week, so I have no excuses. 

 Q. Is there a shot that you thought stuck out throughout the round?
 BOB MCGRATH: Yeah, I hit a couple good shots on the front nine after making the turn. I hit a good iron on No. 2, a 7-iron into there. So, yeah, I didn't hit a lot of good shots, but there was a couple that stood out.

 Q. Was the weather affecting you at all or is that different?
 BOB MCGRATH: Playing conditions are perfect. No discusses again. An absolute perfect day.
