 Q. The morning round for you seemed a little better today than yesterday. Did the course play a little different?
 BOB MCGRATH: Well, yeah, actually I got off to another poor start. I played the back pretty decent. I made a birdie on 10. So that was kind of nice to hit a good iron shot in there and make a putt.

 Q. What was your debut experience like?
 BOB MCGRATH: Well, it obviously it's spectacular facility and a wonderful place to be and so I just feel privileged to be able to have the opportunity the PGA's provided to the seniors and our club professional championship to participate in this. 

 Q. What do you take away in terms of memories to go home with?
 BOB MCGRATH: The memories, yeah, that's what it's all about is the memories.
