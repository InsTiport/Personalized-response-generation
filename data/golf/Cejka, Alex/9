Q. Solid finish there at 16 and 17 to get it back to even par.  Your thoughts on how this day went?
ALEX CEJKA: It was a lucky finish.  It's a bit tough out there.  I don't know what they did to the golf course overnight but it was playing like a U.S. Open.  It was just lightning fast greens.
Luckily if you hit the fairways, it's firm, so you have shorter shots to the greens.  But the greens, it's just incredible.  Even if you miss it you have very, very tough up-and-downs.  But I'm pleased, I battled, I was fighting 18 holes, I had a great 2-putts on 16 and 17 to get me back to level par for the day.  And I really like where I'm standing.
So, I'm playing well, so 18 more holes, I just going to go out and try as hard as I can tomorrow and I'll see what happens.
Q. How difficult was it to get a feel for how quick the greens were?
ALEX CEJKA: Already last week in Charlotte the greens were brutally fast.  When we came here the Thursday, Friday, the greens were a little bit softer, a little bit slower, so you think, okay, well, it's going to be a good tournament.  But then I don't know what they did overnight, but I'm telling you the greens are just so fast and firm, it's, it's scary.
And it's scary if you have a downhill, down grain, 30, 40-footer, it's tough to 2-putt.  Even my playing partners today, they're hitting good putts and they are almost putt off the greens.  So you got to be in the right spots and you got to make a lot of putts.
