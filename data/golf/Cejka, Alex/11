 Q.  Tell me about club selection and thoughts on the hole.  
ALEX CEJKA: You know, it's kind of a scary hole a little bit.  But I was playing pretty good.  I just had bad breaks, hit a couple bad shots at the wrong time, so I was like a couple over par already.   
I wanted to get at least one birdie coming in on 17, 18, and it was a perfect number for a great 8-iron.  I just hit it pretty solid and it was right at the pin all the time.  With the wind, you don't know how it's going to react, but it stayed pretty straight.  It just pitched shy of the hole and disappeared.  It was a crazy feeling, and especially in front of the crowds here.  That was very nice.   
 Q.  So you know Quicken Loans, for every hole-in-one pays a mortgage; how do you feel knowing someone just won?  
ALEX CEJKA: Yeah, I did a hole-in-one a couple months ago at the Shriners in Vegas.  I'm glad I'm supporting somebody, so that's nice.   
 Q.  Did it give you any momentum to have a nice finish on 18?  
ALEX CEJKA: Yeah, of course you want to, a hole-in-one is always crazy.  It's definitely not a birdie or an eagle, so you make a hole-in-one, everybody is going crazy.  I was going to, par 5 down wind, I was like, come on, if you make a birdie -- it was a grinding day today with the wind and with the way the course was playing.  I said if I make one more birdie on 18, I think 1-over par would be a great round today.   
You know, I gave myself a chance with a 5-footer for a birdie and I made it.  It was a really hard grind especially for me today and I'm happy with 1-over par.
