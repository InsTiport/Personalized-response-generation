  Q. Alex, can you talk a little bit about your round today and the high points?   
 ALEX CEJKA: It was an early start. The wind was not blowing so much. I started 2-under today. I had a couple of good chances, made a couple of birdies coming in, so I'm very pleased with 5-under today.  
  
  Q. Do you think giving that you played the morning round, if the wind kicks up in the afternoon, do you think your score will be pretty good after the end?  
 ALEX CEJKA: Yeah. I think so, 5-under is good even if it's not windy or windy. So you know, I should be up there, maybe not leading, maybe not third, but 5-under is up there.   
 We have three more rounds to go. It's a good start. It's actually one of my best starts this year, so I'm very pleased.  
  
  Q. And the course conditions after they've gotten 12 inches of rain in a week.   
 ALEX CEJKA: It's wet. You can kind of play. So yesterday was a little bit unfair.   
 I played actually one hole in the morning before they blew the whistle. So it was a little bit unfair, and I bogeyed. And it was still wet yesterday afternoon, but it's drying out a little bit, but it's still wet.  
  
  Q. Now you got a big break and probably 27 tomorrow or more. Any thoughts on that?  
 ALEX CEJKA: Yeah. I'm going to fly home and see my kids and come back tonight.  
  
  Q. All right. Thanks.
