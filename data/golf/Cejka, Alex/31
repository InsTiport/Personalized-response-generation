 Q. 9 under right there in the mix. I know it's been a long week, long day and so forth. Just some thoughts on you how you're feeling? 
 ALEX CEJKA: I must say, I'm a little bit tired today. But I'm glad I got seven holes in or six and a half, and I'm two under par today. So it's nice. 
 I should be ready tomorrow. Hopefully we'll have good weather and we can finish in time.
