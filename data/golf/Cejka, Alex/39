   ALEX CEJKA: The greens were hard. The pin positions are tricky. I had a good up-and-down round, a couple of unnecessary bogeys, a couple of birdies.   
 I'm delighted with a birdie on 18. That was two good shots. And it's a good way to finish today.   
  
  Q. Were you concerned that it was getting away from you, especially after the couple three-putts?  
 ALEX CEJKA: No, not really. I feel positive. You make mistakes, there's no doubt. Everybody makes mistakes, it's just not make stupid and big mistakes.   
 And I battled back and I'm still in double digits, so that was my goal today.   
  
  Q. One last question, was there a shot or a time out there today that you said, okay, I'm back on the offense, I'm back on the attack, something that kind of turned you and got you rolling again?  
 ALEX CEJKA: Yeah, there was like actually the good bunker shot on 11. I made a birdie there. And followed with a great tee shot with the next and birdied the next hole to put me 1-under for the round. That got me going a little bit. It was okay.
