Q.  You went into the final day knowing all you can do is impress your captain and you've done that.
ALEX CEJKA:  I'm very pleased with the way I've played, especially today.  It was a good finishing round not only for the captain, but for the tournament, also.   I played solid all week long.  And I think realistically, yesterday, looking at the winning score, 20-, 21-under, what it's going to be, I knew it's going to be tough.  I need a magic number.  But, I was hanging in there and I tried as low as I could today.

It's great here.  I've got a lot of friends, a lot of fans and I'm pleased for BMW and everyone supporting me, it's unbelievable.
Q.  How disappointed will you be if you don't get into the World Cup?
ALEX CEJKA:  I don't know yet.  It may come down to the last three or four weeks.  Of course, I would be delighted if I make it.  If not, there's always the next time.
