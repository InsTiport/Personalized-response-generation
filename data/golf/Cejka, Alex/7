 Q.  Talk about the changes to the Ryder Cup format.  
ALEX CEJKA: With the new changes, it's better for us.  It's still you got to be quite good, it's not easy, because there's great players in Europe, too.  But for the guys who play over here, it's a little bit easier.  But still, if you want to play on the Ryder Cup, you just got to play good and earn your spot.   
 Q.  The condition like to become a vice captain or captain, are you okay with this?  
ALEX CEJKA: Yes, I think I'm okay with this.  Yes, yes.
