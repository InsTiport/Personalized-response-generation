 Q. If you could, just talk a little bit about your round. You're one off the lead. Just a short putt at the end there got you there. 
 ALEX CEJKA: Yeah. I had a bunch of chances. I really played well today. I struck the ball very well. I had a chance on every hole, I think. Really could have had three, four more today, but that's golf. You make some nice ones, you make a couple 10-footers. 
 The greens were really good in the afternoon, especially with the rain a little bit. They were a little bit bouncy, but you know, feeling great, and look forward to three more days.

 Q. Have you been doing anything different of late?
 ALEX CEJKA: No. I've been playing well lately. I missed the last two cuts because I wasn't feeling well. I was in the hospital at the Greenbrier last week on the weekend. I had a couple health issues in Canada and last week. 
 So now I'm fit, and you know, I started where I left off in Reno where I finished fourth. Playing hopefully is going to continue the next couple days.

 Q. What do you think the course will be like tomorrow if it dries out, no more rain?
 ALEX CEJKA: It doesn't really make that much difference. The ball is rolling a little bit, you know, but it's a great course. I like it here. 
 You know, I played well the last couple years here, maybe didn't score as well, but I played well in the past years, and I like it. I can visualize it. 
 And you know, we'll see. I mean it's a little bit low, low-scoring course. You have a lot of chances, so you know, 5, 6, 7-under could be, you know, if you play well, could be almost every day. 
 Again, it depends on the wind. It normally blows in the afternoon, so we'll see.
