Q.   Tough day today?

ALEX CEJKA:  Just very unlucky twice in the bunker, in the lip and in the face there.  So that's where we take double bogey, two double bogeys, on 13 and 14.  That's where we got really screwed.  It was not necessary.  We had a few chances, but it's halfway.  Anything is possible.


Q.   After what happened on 13 and 14 in the sand, are you sitting there at 18 when you see his ball off 18 go in the sand, what are you thinking?

ALEX CEJKA:   I'm thinking, Go, go, go.  He normally can hit it past the trap.  He probably didn't quite catch it. 


Q.   The sand here, between what you play on the Tour and in Europe, this is a completely different sand?

ALEX CEJKA:   This is like a beach sand.  It's very difficult to spin the ball from the trap even up by the green.
