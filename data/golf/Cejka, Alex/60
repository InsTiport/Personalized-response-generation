Q.   All in all a good week.  Are you satisfied with how you played?

ALEX CEJKA:  It was a good week.  We were a little bit down during the week, but we fought all the way.  It was the first tournament for Marcel, but he showed he can play.  He helped me a lot during the week, so did I.  It's a team event.  I think we both are very pleased right now.  You never know, maybe France makes a bogey on the last, but we're happy so far.


Q.   How did you feel about the way the course played?  Is it what you expected?  Is it better conditions than you expected?

ALEX CEJKA:  It was nice conditions.  The fairways are perfect, the greens are nice, a little too firm for me, to be honest.  The course was playing very long compared to five years ago or six years ago when I was here.  I remember hitting short iron shots onto a lot of greens, and today I'm standing with a 5-iron, 4-iron, 3-iron.  It's a little bit different and it's a great track.


Q.   What are you looking forward to the next few weeks or next few months?

ALEX CEJKA:   I'm going to work hard on my game again.  That was my last tournament.  I'm going to start at the Bob Hope and Phoenix next year.  I'm going to have a nice rest now in the winter and get ready for next year.
