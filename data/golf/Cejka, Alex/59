Q.
Just talk about how you played today and your round, the match. 

ALEX CEJKA:  I played actually pretty solid.  I drove the ball very well.  You know, my overall game was medium.  I had a few good putts when I needed to win the hole or tie the hole.  Justin drove the ball really well but in the rough, which is brutal.  But I played okay overall.


Q.  Talk about how you made some good putts when you needed to.  Was there a turning point in that round?

ALEX CEJKA:  Yeah, I made a good one on No. 9 to win the hole to go 2 up, and made a good putt on No. 10 to go 3 up, so that was the turning point.  9 and 10, I won two holes in a row to go 3 up, so there was a little bit of cushion there.


Q.  Who does it look like you're going to play tomorrow?

ALEX CEJKA:  I think it's Romero.  He's playing Darren Clarke.  I think he's 1 up.
