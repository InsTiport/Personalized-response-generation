 Q. Alex, tremendous round today, just get some comments on the day, if we can?
 ALEX CEJKA: I played pretty solid. Kind of like yesterday. I really liked playing in the mornings. We had perfect weather for the first 14 holes. I took advantage of the front nine. I played pretty solid.
 The same with putting. Like yesterday I made a couple of good putts and it always shows. And I'm pretty happy to be double digits in the clubhouse after two rounds.

 Q. How close do you guys actually live to each other in Vegas, you and Kevin?
 ALEX CEJKA: It's like --

 Q. Not close? 
 ALEX CEJKA: Ten minutes. That's close. 

 Q. Just close enough?
 ALEX CEJKA: Just close enough. We see each other in the casino all the time (laughter). 

 Q. He says he's not a gambler?
 ALEX CEJKA: I'm not either.
