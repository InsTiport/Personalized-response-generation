 Q. Alex, obviously wish it was under different circumstances congratulating you right now, but another good week for you. Can you just tell me about how you think everything went for you today and just overall, the week in general?
 ALEX CEJKA: I played really well. I had two bad swings on the par-3, pushed it a little bit right and made bogey and pushed my tee shot on the next flag to double. 
 On this golf course you miss three shots in two holes it's really difficult to bounce back. I had a couple birdies, like 8, 10, 11, 12. Suddenly I was tied for first again, and then unfortunately error again on the water hole, I think it was 15 or 14. 
 You know, if I make par, I have a really good chance. You know, it's a pity. Third is great. Obviously Bill played really well today, I think 66 or 65. So I knew if I -- to win I need to shoot 2, 3-under at least, you know. So I gave it the best I could, and gotta wait for another week.

 Q. Did you think it was all within reach there coming towards the end?
 ALEX CEJKA: Yeah.

 Q. You were one, two strokes away there coming all the way towards the very end. 
 ALEX CEJKA: Yeah. Especially when I was 16-under. Everybody was 16-under. I just said, you know, one more birdie. And then I just hit it in the water. A bogey under those circumstances really cost me, you know. 
 But if I don't make bogey there, I had great chances, you know, on 15 and 16. You know, 18, maybe it would be different if I was 16 under or 17-under at the start, but you know, that's the way it is.

 Q. What does this do for your confidence?
 ALEX CEJKA: Oh, really well. I mean I'm playing great. I'm knocking at the door. I'm up there. I had a couple of Top 10 finishes, even top -- Reno was fourth, now third. So it's -- I'm getting there where I want to be.

 Q. Looking forward to your next event?
 ALEX CEJKA: Oh, yes.
