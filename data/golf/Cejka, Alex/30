  Q. Obviously, it's taken you a couple of days to play this third round. Bogey free for that period of time, so you must be pretty happy with that?  
 ALEX CEJKA: Yeah, I'm happy. I hit the ball pretty well. The short game is pretty good even though I missed a couple of greens so I can -- well, I did make up-and-down so far.   
 So it's really good. I'm playing well, I'm feeling well, so we'll see what happens this afternoon.  
  
  Q. How much different was the course this morning than yesterday afternoon?  
 ALEX CEJKA: It was a little bit softer, the ball didn't travel so far for me this morning. The greens are a little bit softer than the first couple of days. A little bit mud on the balls off the tee I've noticed, but that's everybody.  
  
  Q. You're going to be the group ahead, looks like Jason's going to be leading. Any advantage in that maybe getting in there earlier than him and putting pressure on him?   
 ALEX CEJKA: We've got 18 holes to go. I'm in a great position. I haven't been there in a while. So it's good.   
 I'm feeling well, I'm playing well, so hopefully I can keep it up for 18 more holes.
