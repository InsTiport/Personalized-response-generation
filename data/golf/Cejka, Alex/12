 Q.  So, if you could, great start, 6-under to the tournament.  How do you feel about your first round?  
ALEX CEJKA: I feel good.  It's tough on all of us arriving here on Tuesday with the time change and the long trip.   
I was a little bit unlucky that yesterday afternoon.  I could only play nine holes in the pro-am, so I kind of played the other nine blind, but I hit good shots and made some good putts and I'm very pleased with the round today.   
 Q.  What was the key to your 6-under today?  
ALEX CEJKA: I think that I kept it in the fairway.  Obviously, with preferred lies.  You want to hit it on the fairway.  You can wipe the mud off and then you have a nice shot into the green.   
The par-5s, I almost took advantage on every par-5, I think, and just putted well, made a couple 15, 20 footers, that's always nice on these greens.  It's a little bit different than what we are normally used to in America, and you know, it was nice to see them go in.   
 Q.  What does that do for your confidence going forward for the next few rounds, knowing that you're off to a good start?  
ALEX CEJKA: Confidence.  You know, I played well last week already, I had a good start, I'm playing right now the same.   
In golf you never know.  Every day can be a little bit different.  I hope I'm going to hit a lot of fairways tomorrow, a lot of greens, and give me good chances for birdies and hopefully I make some putts.   
But I got to be patient.  I mean, it's three rounds to go and it's, that's a long way.  Luckily, no cut, so yeah, you play a little bit, a little bit more aggressive than normally, especially the first two days, but it's all good right now.
