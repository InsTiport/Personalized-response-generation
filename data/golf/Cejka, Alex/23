 Q. The two nines did not end the way you wanted them to, but what a round, 67.
 ALEX CEJKA: I played pretty solid. I was a little unlucky, I 4-putted 18, putting for eagle you walk off with a bogey and that always hurts. Now on 9, I hit it pin-high and just on the fringe and the putter caught a little bit of grass and I left it short. 
 So unlucky, but you know, that's the way it goes sometimes, and overall, I'm very pleased with my play today.

 Q. A lot of guys have missed a lot of putts at 9. Phil 3-putted it earlier today and Baddeley, he 4-putted it earlier this week. If you get at all having to work with the slope on that hole, it's tough?
 ALEX CEJKA: It's tough, not only on that hole but a bunch of holes where you really have to be careful, especially when you're above the hole. Overall I putted well, just two hiccups really, but I'm still kind of up there and it's a good feeling so far. 

 Q. You're very much in it. You know, you're part of a trivia question, only three guy who is finished in the Top-10 here at Pebble Beach last year in both tournaments, Dustin, Phil and you. You like it here. 
 ALEX CEJKA: I do. I mean, what's not to like? We just are overlooking the ocean, it's beautiful, people are down on the beach. It's calm. It's nice and warm. I think all three courses are just spectacular and I love to come back here.

 Q. Do the courses play a little bit softer today or still just as firm and fast as all week? 
 ALEX CEJKA: Yeah, well, the greens here today were a little bit firm I must say. I hit a lot of good shots and it's not as firm as the U.S. Open but it was firm.
