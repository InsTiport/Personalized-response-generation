 Q.   Alex, first and foremost, the PGA TOUR radio didn't get a chance to see it last week, congratulations on being a winner on the PGA TOUR.   You carried the momentum over nicely.  
ALEX CEJKA:   I've been playing well the last couple weeks.   This is the highlight of my career.   It was a little bit different, my Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday here, obviously everybody comes up to you so you're not in your zone what I normally do.   I played well today.   I took the momentum over.   I putted well and that's what you need to do here.  
   
 Q.   Speaking of carrying the momentum over, this golf course when you teed off thought we were going to have the teeth of it and all of a sudden everything laid down.   
Did you get to a point, "I got to really take advantage of it"?  
ALEX CEJKA:   It's still changing.   You still have to be in the fairway to be able to hit the flag so, you know, it's just like I was patient, I was hitting good shots, good tee shots.   
Most of the time I was on the fairway and had good chances to attack the pin but I'm very happy with my score today and we'll see what happens the next few days.
