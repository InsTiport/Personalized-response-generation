 Q.   Just talk to many he about your round today.  
ALEX CEJKA:   I was fighting.   I was fighting from the beginning.   You know, I had a good start.   I birdied 1 and 2, kind of kept it going.   Then I had a good front nine.   The Back 9 was a little bit tricky with the wind with the pin positions, but I gave myself a couple of chances, and unlucky on the last.   You know, I made only five par with a great tee shot.   
But you know, that's the way it is.   Overall I'm happy to play that solid over four days here.   And I will see what happens.  
   
 Q.   When you started today, what were you thinking?  
ALEX CEJKA:   I was just thinking making good shots and giving myself chances.   You know, that's the only thing you can do.   You go out, try to make good shots, give yourself birdie chances, you know, and then hopefully you make them.   
I left a couple out there, two, but you know, that's the way it is, and you know, we'll see again what happens in whatever, half an hour.   Maybe it's good enough for the playoff would be nice.   If not, then still a great week.  
   
 Q.   Were you looking at the leaderboard today?  
ALEX CEJKA:   I was actually not looking on the leaderboard until the 17th hole.   I was just playing my game, and I looked on the 17, and you know, that's how I knew I kind of stand pretty good.  
   
 Q.   When you started the 17th or were you finished?  
ALEX CEJKA:   No.   When I finished, on the green.  
   
 Q.   So let's talk about 18.  
ALEX CEJKA:   18, I hit a great drive.   I had a 3‑iron in, but my club got a little bit wet from the rain, and I hit it good, but not good enough, and I hit it into that front bunker, what was a really, really difficult shot up by the lip.   But I gave myself a great chance, like a ten‑footer.   Just hit it a little bit too soft, and it broke a little bit more than I wanted.
