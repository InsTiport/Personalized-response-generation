Q. 2-under par 6, talk us through your reflections.
SØREN KJELDSEN:   Probably a tale of two halves.  Front nine, couldn't really hit my hand, and then had a nice little run middle of the back nine that probably saved the day to be honest.  A bit scratchy.
Q. You mentioned on the course yesterday that you were trying to focus on the next shot, not getting down.  How well do you feel you achieved that, despite the frustrations out there today?
SØREN KJELDSEN:   Pretty well, yeah.  Pretty well.  I mean, sometimes I think if you fight it, you just make it worse.  I tried not to fight it too much on the front nine.  Ended up sort of battling a half-decent score.   Hopefully put together a good Sunday.  Leaders haven't gotten away too much,s so all to play for still tomorrow.
