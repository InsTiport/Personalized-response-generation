GARY NICKLAUS: I played a lot better than 78.  Bad finish, didn't make a putt all day.  I think the longest putt I made was about four feet, the second putt on 1.  I hit a lot of fairways and hit quite a few greens and didn't make any putts and had a poor finish.
Q. I know it's not the score you want, but --
GARY NICKLAUS: No, it's not.
Q. Are you happy to be back playing in the U.S. Amateur?
GARY NICKLAUS: Well, it's always great being in a USGA event.  It's the pinnacle.  But you'd rather not shoot 78 when you do it.
Q. Does this whet your appetite to do this more often?
GARY NICKLAUS: I'm not sure exactly --
Q. But to play in these type of events?
GARY NICKLAUS: Yeah, I've tried to qualify every year the last few years, and typically I'm either one off or in a playoff, and this year I got in.  I mean, I enjoyed playing, but I don't typically play in a lot of events at home.  I don't particularly like to travel too much anymore, except when you're coming to places like Pebble Beach, which is awesome.
