 GARY NICKLAUS:  Yes, I got off to a good start today.  I birdied the first hole, birdied 3, birdied 4.  Missed a 2 and-a-half footer for birdie for 5.  I should have been 4-under through 5.  And then birdied 7 and 9, so 31 to the front was pretty strong.  I struggled my way in the back.  I wasn't driving it in the fairway.  So I was struggling a little bit with the short game to have it come in.  I came home with a 38.  Not too bad.

Q.  All of the guys shooting low talked about how important it is to get off to a good start.  Do you feel good about that even though you struggled with the short game?
GARY NICKLAUS:  Yes, I felt good the way I got out on the front side. I need to work on -- my ball striking the back was not so hot.  My short game kept me in the game. It's important to be under par and give yourself a little comfort into the second round.

Q.  (Inaudible)
GARY NICKLAUS:  I think it's a great hole now.  It was a great hole before.  Now it's a great hole and a tough hole.  I played it not as good as I can play it today, except I missed the putt.  I was driving a 9-iron up there at ten feet and it lipped out, but that hole hole isn't going to play that way all the time.

Q.  What will you be thinking about tonight?  The leader board is all over the place, there are some great golfers and some great golf ahead.  What are you thinking about now?
GARY NICKLAUS:  Getting some dinner right now, not thinking about any of -- I'm not going to worry about any of it.
