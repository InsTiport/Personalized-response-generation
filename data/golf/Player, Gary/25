 GARY PLAYER: To have your two little grandchildren caddieing for you, how can it get any better? 

 Q. Well I guess if you had a hole-in-one maybe. 
 GARY PLAYER: Well I had a couple of holes-in-one in this event here, so that's been pretty fortunate.

 Q. How about your playing partners, how did they do?
 GARY PLAYER: They played nicely, and we had a great time. 
 We have always been very competitive, but with great respect for each other. We traveled all over the world playing golf and promoting it. Not getting large sums of money like these young guys do today, but it's been a great experience. 

 Q. Can I ask you about the Legends?
 GARY PLAYER: Yes, I'm looking forward to coming. Bob Charles and I have won it twice in a row and so we're looking forward to coming back and playing. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 GARY PLAYER: Oh, we played for so many years, to be able to play -- the thing about golf is you can play and compete forever. In other sports, you're very limited.
