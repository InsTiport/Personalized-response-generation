 Q.  How did you do today? 
 GARY PLAYER:  It's tough out there.  If you miss the flag on the wrong side it's very difficult to recover.  I played very well today.  I hit I had 15 good holes.  This place has turned out to be one of three toughest courses in the world, Carnoustie, and The Links in South Africa. 
 It's playing beautifully today (the course).  The course is magnificent.  The two best shots I hit today I made bogey on number 6 and number 15. 

 Q.  On Vaughn Taylor. 
 GARY PLAYER:  He played very nicely.  He did some serious putting out there.
