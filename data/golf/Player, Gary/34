  Q.  I know you're disappointed you didn't come out on top but you had a pretty big hill to climb today, you must be proud of how they played today.   
 GARY PLAYER:  A monumental hill, and very proud of both teams.  Our mission was to come out and give golf a great boost to this country, I've never seen more enthusiasm in the gallery.  Our guys can hold their head up high.  They won more singles matches today; made a match of it.   
 Congratulations to America, they played extremely well and deserved to win.   
 And to Mike Weir, I can say well done my friends, that's a big thing in your life.   
  
  Q.  Now you had to think that things were pretty much done for Mike on the 15th when he lost that hole, didn't you?   
 GARY PLAYER:  Well, you know the game, it looked like he was gone, and that's the mark of a champion.  You can see why he won the Masters.  He comes back, he wins 17 and he wins 18.  Can you imagine the pressure for him on the last hole?  And he didn't back off, he banged it right at the flag.  And in front of your own people, this will turn his life around.   
 We were just discussing, when people are having adversity in life, we all think it's tough but adversity is here for a reason and it's God's plan that everybody's got to suffer a bit and he'll come back next year smelling like a rose.
