Q.  Today's round, there had to have been some things that had to go right for you, what did you feel that you did well and what was some positives that you felt taken out of this round?
GARY PLAYER:  I played some nice shots today, I just had, on the back nine I had two 6s, I had a double bogey off the edge of the green at number 6.  And I had a 6 at the par 5.

Other than that I played a pretty nice round.  If I get two pars there I shoot 73, which is not a bad round.  So, but it's, that's what happens when you get to 70, you get a few of those double bogeys and things you shouldn't do.

The course was in great shape.  I went off at 1:50.  I must say that's the first time I played a round of golf in my life where I felt a little bit tired.  Never in my life.  That's the first time.  But that's also due to being 70.
Q.  Did you feel the playing in the pairing with Trevino, was it able to keep the atmosphere loose, you were certainly a crowd favorite, could you feel the gallery support with you and Lee in the same pairing?
GARY PLAYER:  Very much so and all week I've been here the fans have been fantastic.  And it's great to see a great turnout, it's a well organized tournament, very nice golf course.  Don't like the tree on number 10 in the middle of the fairway.  I mean, I never heard ever having a tree in the middle of the fairway.  And then the par 5 with rocks in the middle of the fairway.  If they would take those rocks a way out of the middle of the fairway and the tree out of 10, it would be an AAA golf course.
