   GARY PLAYER: He played incredible golf today. His swing is absolutely the closest that I have seen to Ben Hogan, and I've always thought that Ben Hogan was the best striker of the ball from tee to green that I ever saw, from tee to green. And I think the closest to Ben Hogan's swing is Trevor Immelman. Marvelous.   
  
  Q. He told us what he went through this winter. He said you called him when he had the tumor removed.  
 GARY PLAYER: I don't want to take any credit for what Trevor has done. When he was not well, I phoned him as I would phone any professional golfer on the Tour if he was having trouble. Quite a few guys have had cancer and other problems, and these are people we grew up with, and I make a point of phoning them and trying to contact people, and Trevor and the South African guys are very special to me, obviously.   
 I was concerned about him having an operation, a very big operation, and it takes a long time to get over that. But he's done extremely well, but he won the Million Dollar Classic at the Gary Player Country Club this year. Great start, and had a wonderful score. I wish him every success.   
  
  Q. Do you think he's had a tougher time because of what he went through this winter?  
 GARY PLAYER: Everybody has times where you have conditions, and I had a bladder operated, Ernie had a knee. Everybody usually goes through their career something, and it takes two, three months to get over it.
