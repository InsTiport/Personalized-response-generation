Q. Just a thought on what it's like to go around yet again. You said it was the first nine you played since a year ago here. 
JACK NICKLAUS: No, no, no. I said it's the first time I walked nine. I've had a hard time walking the last couple years and I need to walk here, so when you haven't walked it's hard to walk. 

Q. A nifty little chip here still showing your soft hands. What does it mean to you to have the chance to come around here one more time? 
GARY PLAYER: Well it means a lot to me because I got another chance next year. If you didn't show up this year, you got problems. No, it had to be placed perfectly. The three of us played well today, but we didn't hole many putts. But it was in magnificent condition and it's just a terrific day. 

Q. Tom, it was a fantastic holed putt there which got you inside the topâ€‘10?
TOM WATSON: Yeah, it just barely dribbled in the front of the hole, didn't it. Kind of like the putt I made against you at Pebble Beach. My dad said, why didn't you lag that? 
JACK NICKLAUS: Wow. You don't think I didn't remember it? 
(Laughter.)
