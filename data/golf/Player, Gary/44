 Q.  Talking about his round. 

 GARY PLAYER:  That 77 is like shooting 65 for me.  That is a tough golf course out there. 

 I remember when Nicklaus won in 1965.  That and this are the two toughest I've ever seen the course. 

 Q.  How do you stay motivated? 

 GARY PLAYER:  I love my work, I love people, I love traveling.  I'm thankful for what golf has done for me. 

 Coming from a poor beginning I never forget about the opportunities that I have had.  I drove the ball accurately.  Par for me out there today was 80. 

 I would never come to play here if I didn't feel competitive. 

 I played so well it encourages me to come back again.  I want to show people about fitness. 

 I have a great enthusiasm. 

 Q.  In reference to Vaughn Taylor. 

 GARY PLAYER:  Told him to hang in there, believe in your self. 

 I don't think of myself as 71.  It was a very, very fabulous week for me.
