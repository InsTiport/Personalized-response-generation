 MODERATOR:   Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Seaside Course for the draw for the second round of the UBS Warburg Cup. 
Tomorrow's play is four-balls, and I have the two captains with me, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player.  As is customary, those of you who saw the draw yesterday know the procedure.  It is Gary's pick, first ball, which he is already a player.
GARY PLAYER:   Okay.  I'll be playing with Bernhard longer.
MODERATOR:   So Gary and Bernhard Langer play against Arnold Palmer and ... 
ARNOLD PALMER:  That will be Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson. 
MODERATOR:   Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson will play in the first match at 8:00 tomorrow morning against Gary Player and Bernhard Langer. 
Arnold, your pick. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  Okay.  My next team will be Raymond Floyd and Tom Lehman. 
GARY PLAYER:   Who did Torrance and Woosnam play today?  They played Floyd and Lehman.  And Arnold has chosen Lehman and  -- the same, same team. 
I'll have Torrance and Woosnam. 
MODERATOR:  So it's Raymond Floyd and Tom Lehman playing Sam Torrance and Ian Woosnam at 8:15 in Match No.  2. 
Match No. 3, Gary, it's your first choice. 
GARY PLAYER:   I put Ebihara and Aoki. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  Match No. 3, and you want me to pick someone to play them. 
MODERATOR:   Correct. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  And they beat my guys today, didn't they.  They won their match.  I'm going to give them a chance to do it again tomorrow.  Funk and Gilder. 
MODERATOR:   Fred Funk and Bob Gilder will play in match No. 3 against Aoki and Ebihara at 8:30. 
Arnold, it's your pick, first pick for match No. 4. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  No. 4 for my guys will be Curtis Strange and Hale Irwin. 
GARY PLAYER:   And I'm put Eduardo Romero and Nick Faldo. 
MODERATOR:   So Curtis Strange and Hale Irwin versus Eduardo Romero in Match No. 4 at 8:45. 
Gary, it's your first pick for Match No. 5. 
GARY PLAYER:   I'll take Barry Lane and Denis Durnian. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  And I will have Tom Kite and Scott Hoch. 
MODERATOR:   So Tom Kite and Scott Hoch play Barry Lane and Denis Durnian in Match No. 5 at 9:00. 
Which leaves Paul Azinger and Mark O'Meara to play Rodger Davis and Stewart Ginn in the final match at 9:15. 
So, ladies and gentlemen, if there are any questions to the two captains.
ARNOLD PALMER:  8:00? 
MODERATOR:   Yes, because we have to finish earlier for television than in previous years, and with a five-hour round, we need to start about 8:00. 

Q.  For both captains, if you could discuss your strategy for the matchups for tomorrow, many of the teamings are the same as today.  Can you just talk about the lineups for tomorrow?  P?
GARY PLAYER:   Your turn.  I've been answering questions first.  Your turn. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  Well, I didn't pair too many of my same guys.  I changed.  I changed Azinger and Hoch.  I changed -- the only one that's the same is Floyd and Lehman. 
So I've changed all mine, really.  And I'm trying to give the guys an opportunity to play with different people in the matches.  I think that's part of the fun, and I tried to put the strong guys with some of the weak guys, like Watson and myself, and that sort of thing.  You have to figure out who the strong one is.  (Laughter.)
But that's my thing.  I had a couple, what I thought were pretty strong combinations, and one of my strong combinations lost.  That surprised me.  But the other one won handily.  So, it was a split on that. 
Hey, that's the fun of the whole thing.  We have some fun doing it and I think the guys, they want to win.  They enjoy playing with different people, too.  End of my story. 
GARY PLAYER:   Pretty much the same. 

Q.  Why do you guys schedule yourselves out so early in the morning?  Why don't you sleep in and get a little more rest?  
ARNOLD PALMER:  You know, I agree with that, except I don't sleep in. 
GARY PLAYER:   Why didn't you make that decision before we made the team? 
ARNOLD PALMER:  I didn't know we were going to do the same thing.  They have asked us to go first. 
GARY PLAYER:   That's how the procedure is.

Q.  Well, that's very obedient of both of you.
MODERATOR:   The idea is they go out first, and then go out and encourage the rest of the team. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  What time are we playing Sunday? 
MODERATOR:   9:15. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  That's okay.

Q.  Do you do that, do you go back out on the course and encourage your gladiators?
GARY PLAYER:   Oh, last year, I went out after I finished  -- it was hot. 

Q.  And you got results, didn't you. 
ARNOLD PALMER:  They came in.  It was tight, really tight. 
MODERATOR:   Well, that concludes the draw for the second round, ladies and gentlemen.  We'll see you again tomorrow, thank you.
