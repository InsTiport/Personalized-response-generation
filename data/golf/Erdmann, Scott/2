 Q. Obviously not what you were looking for, but what went on out there?
 SCOTT ERDMANN: Oh, gosh. You know, the front nine was just kind of rolling along, kind of got off to a slow start, but righted the ship and just was cruising. It's hard to attribute it to kind of where the wheels came off. Probably the easiest spot to maybe say would be 12, par-5, hit a 4 hybrid in, kind of came out of it and missed it and came back in the water. Still made a bogey, wasn't the end of the world. Parred the next hole from a tough spot, and then I suppose if there was one -- it was a collection of things. Terrible bunker shot on 14, bad tee shot on 15. It got ugly quick. 

 Q. Can you bounce back? What's the goal for tomorrow? 
 SCOTT ERDMANN: Well, the goal is just to -- no different, I suppose, than it ever would be, just one shot at a time and try to play better. Yeah, just one shot at a time.

 Q. I know that we've talked, it's been an incredible week for you, though, being here, right?
 SCOTT ERDMANN: Absolutely, absolutely incredible. It's been a lot of fun. Played some amazing practice rounds with some great people and everybody was great and really nice. There was no kind of big-timing that you think you might possibly encounter with Tour pros, but no, everyone was great. It's been a lot of fun.
