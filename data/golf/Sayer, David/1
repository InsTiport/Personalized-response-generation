Q.   A dream just became a reality, try and describe how that feels on your birthday? 
DAVID SAYER:   I honestly am speechless, never come close to winning a tournament at my own club, let alone winning the Alfred Dunhill Links on my birthday, which has been a fabulous week.   Thomas has coached me through quite a lot and been a bit of a birdie machine himself.   Dovetailed, ham‑and‑egged quite a bit, but yeah, just been phenomenal.
