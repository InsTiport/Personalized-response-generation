  SAMANTHA RICHDALE:   I hit the ball better today, but still struggled, like I said.   Eight greens isn't very good, and I didn't make a lot of my up‑and‑downs.

Q.   Give me your overall impressions of this week? 
SAMANTHA RICHDALE:   You know, I thought it was awesome.   Like I said, it's fun to be able to play in Canada.   We only have a limited amount of opportunities to play here per year, and to have my family come out is pretty nice.
