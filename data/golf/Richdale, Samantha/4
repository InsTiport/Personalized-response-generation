  Q. Wonderful round of golf out there. Where did it come from?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: I don't know. My caddie and I have been talking earlier, and working really hard and haven't seen the results. So I think it all came together today.  
  
  Q. Six birdies on the round out there. Flawless round of golf. Was there a moment you got out there and felt very, very comfortable?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, No, not really. But I just kept kind of plugging away and had some good shots, and my caddie read some really good putts.  
  
  Q. It's tough when you can't get some momentum going and playing a few weeks in a row. Have you found that difficult this summer?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, it's been difficult, but I've also enjoyed the time off with my family.  
  
  Q. But can you get in a groove and hone your game while you're at home?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: You can enjoy life while you're at home. So I guess it kind of -- I don't know. It equals out.  
  
  Q. How comfortable are you seeing your name on the top of that leaderboard or right up near the top?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, it's pretty nice. It's been a while, so first time on the LPGA, so it's pretty exciting.  
  
  Q. And to do it in front of the home country fans at least anyway?  
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, this is the place to do it.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible) is going to be proud of you?  
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, I just saw her. I gave her a hug. It was nice to see her.  
  
  Q. Are you a little surprised what happened today?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, I haven't played that well, but like I said, I've been working really hard, but I haven't seen the results.  
  
  Q. What have you worked hard on mostly, your putting?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, about a month ago or just over a month ago I went and saw Dave Stockton, and we've been working really hard with my putting. You know, like I said, today my caddie and I read some really good putts and we made them.  
  
  Q. What does it mean to you to be so high up the leaderboard at the Canadian Open?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, it's pretty special. I had my brother in the crowd, which is really nice. We had great weather this afternoon, and it's kind of a nice ending to the day.  
  
  Q. What is your brother's name?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Josh.   
  
  Q. The rain didn't bother you at all?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: It was pretty quick. Kind of came in. I thought we were going to get pulled off the course for a bit, and we didn't end up. Yeah, it wasn't that bad.  
  
  Q. When was the last time you were in this kind of position being so close to the lead in such a big event?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: You know, I really haven't been this high on the LPGA yet. I won last year in Taiwan in a smaller tournament, but that's kind of about it, I guess.  
  
  Q. Do you have ways of dealing with pressure and that sort of thing overnight to come back tomorrow and put in another good round?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: You know what, I haven't been in the position for so long I haven't thought about it. I'll just go have a nice dinner tonight and keep the same routine as I did today.  
  
  Q. What worked well for you today?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: We had a really good pace out there. Like I said, my caddie and I read some really good putts and they went in today.  
  
  Q. Can you tell us about your caddie? He's one of the older guys on Tour?  
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Yeah, we started working together a year ago last tournament. He's great for me. He's very calm, very collected. I love being out there with him.   
 We have a lot of great conversation, and he knows when to calm me down. It's very comfortable. We read putts well together, pick out targets well together.  
  
  Q. What is his name?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Tom Konopacki.  
  
  Q. Do you know how old he is by chance?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: I don't know if he wants me to give that. Let's just say his birthday is coming up next week, I you believe. But I won't give away those details.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible)?  
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: Oh, yeah, that's right. We had a stacked Pro-Am too this week. We didn't really use my shots. I mean, some of the ladies -- we had a young girl Maria Theres who hits farther than I do off the front tees so I was just there cheerleading. I think I rolled in a couple of putts and that's it.  
  
  Q. You won the Pro-Am?   
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: My group won the Pro-Am, yes.  
  
  Q. How many times have you played the Canadian Open?  
 SAMANTHA RICHDALE: This is my third time.
