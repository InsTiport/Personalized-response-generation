Q. You're getting good at this match play thing.
BETHANY WU: Thanks.  I did a lot of match play tournaments on the college circuit, so now I'm getting used to the match play events.
Q. What's the course like out there?  We've only talked to one other player so far.  Lucy Li said that the greens are getting hard, they're getting fast, and this course is playing long.  What do you think?
BETHANY WU: Yeah, the greens are really hard here.  I think that with -- they're pan-hard greens, and going downhill it just makes it even tougher.
Q. How have you made that adjustment?
BETHANY WU: I've got just to tap it in, basically tap the putt, let it roll wherever it goes.
Q. The last time we talked to you, you were a freshman-to-be at UCLA.  You're a college girl now.  How was your first year?
BETHANY WU: First year was great.  We made it to the semifinals in the NCAA championship, and we finished No. 1 in the country, so I think first year was pretty good.
