 Q.  Great round today.  You're one off the lead with 36 holes to play.  Just some thoughts from you.  
FREDDIE JACOBSON: Yeah, we played well today again.  Had a little bit harder time to find the pace on the greens.  I left myself -- I ran a few putts by early on, had 5- or 6-footers coming back, and I kept making them.  But it's not kind of how you want to start off, because it gets harder to read the putts and everything, so.  Then I came up short on a few.   
So I really struggled a little bit with the pace today on the greens, and I really only made one mistake on the course, on 9 where I mis-clubbed coming in and hit it over the green.  But other than that, I kept playing really well and kept myself out of trouble.   
 Q.  You're playing Monterrey Peninsula tomorrow, correct?  
FREDDIE JACOBSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  And just your thoughts on that golf course.  There's been a lot of low scores on that back nine there.  
FREDDIE JACOBSON: Yeah, I think that any of these courses, if you really get it going, especially with the weather being the way it is, you can make some birdies.  But you still got to do it, it doesn't matter what the course looks like, you got to hit the shots and keep it in play and keep doing it.  That's what I've done for two days, so I got to keep attacking tomorrow and see if I can put up some birdies there.   
 Q.  And this weather is pretty awesome.  
FREDDIE JACOBSON: Yeah, I mean this is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen.  So you walk around, especially early on when we played the coastal holes in the morning, see those big waves rolling in, it's spectacular.
