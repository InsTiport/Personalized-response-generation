Q. Looks like another top-5 finish, do you feel like your game's tracking in the right direction?
FREDDIE JACOBSON: I would have to say yes on that one.  It's been good.  Three Top-5's in the last four starts.  So, I really felt good this week about, on the course.  I haven't played for five months last year, so when I went out in the last group on Saturday at Sea Island, I hadn't been there for a long time so obviously, I felt a little uptight.  I got a little tight on the greens.
Today, I will have to say I wish I had played the par-5s a bit better and gave myself a chance the last couple of holes.
But I really did well holing out and I felt comfortable all day.  So I think just having been there in San Diego as well, I think today I really handled it better than I felt it in a long time.  So I was kind of happy about that.
Q. Coming off a week where you didn't play very much last week, does that give you a lot of confidence knowing you can step right into it and get right into contention?
FREDDIE JACOBSON: Yeah, I mean, I played a lot, I practiced a lot before last week, but you never know.  You go skiing for a week, my body was too tight, I got some great help from the physio guys here.  I saw them on Wednesday before I went out and played Cypress, so that was key, I think, because -- and I got some help up there like the second to last day as well because my legs and lower back were tired after a lot of skiing.  But it worked out.
I started to find it kind of on the last nine holes at Cypress, and then I started feeling pretty good.  I worked on my short game on the morning before my first round here, and then obviously, got off to a good start.
And, obviously, key to get the short game going early because that can really also be rusty when you haven't done it for a week.
