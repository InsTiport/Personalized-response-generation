  CHARLES HOWELL III:   It was a really nice yardage for kind of our gap wedge, 55‑degree sand wedge, and we had enough wind helping us there to make the yardage right, and obviously the ball landed behind the hole, spun back in.   It always takes a bit of luck, right, for a hole‑in‑one.   So we'll take that, and then as far as for the quicken loans, I think it's a wonderful promotion they're doing.   I just wish I could put my name in the hat for it.   No, hopefully whoever is out there will enjoy it, it'll make a difference, but quicken loans has done a wonderful thing.
