 Q.   Thoughts about the day, tied for the lead?   
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well, it was nice to go out early.   It was a bit softer from the rain overnight.   I don't remember much of the course from 2008 and 2010, but compared to the practice days it was a little softer.   It played about as gettable as you could get it.   I think the rough is pretty penal, though, if you do miss the fairways.   So there are some holes you can get but there's some holes you've got to really suck it up on.   
5‑under was about as good as I could have done today, so I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   Did you get in the rough much?   
CHARLES HOWELL III:   A few times.   It's hard to get the ball to the green from the rough.   There's a couple changes in it but if you don't get it downgrain, you're going to have a really hard time getting the ball on the green.   
You know, it was strange, I got off to a nice start, which was good, because I haven't scored well lately.   I've missed the last two cuts, so it was nice, I birdied the first three holes and kind of calmed down a little bit.   That was nice.   And I know I started on 1 versus 10 but still birdieing the first three to calm down a little bit was nicer than not.  
    
 Q.   So PGA and?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Greensboro.   So nice to start off that way.   
   
 Q.   Just to get the bad MoJo ‑‑  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Golf's funny, right.The demons are up there. Just have to keep them quiet.
