  Q.  After the wind died down.   
 CHARLES HOWELL, III:  I've never seen it easy out here.  Didn't play that poorly, other than a couple of 3-putts at 14 and 15.  I just have to do better on the greens.  I'm going to go to work on it now.   
 It's playing extremely firm and fast.  It's always fun playing in front of family and friends.  The Masters makes it even better.   
 Every shot is such a ground around here.   
 I did hit the the ball pretty well, but the three 3-putts hurt.  Sometimes you're better off with your approach shots being 30-40 feet below the hole than 15 feet above it.
