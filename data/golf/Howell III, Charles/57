Q.   Why don't you just get it over with and buy some property and move over here because you love it.   Every year in contention at the Sony Open. 
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well, property is really expensive over here.   No, I like it here.   I don't know why.   I wish I could sort of maybe figure that out.   But I like it.   I've always enjoyed coming here since the first time I came.   It's a nice week.   It's an easy way to start, coming to Hawai'i.

Q.   Good ballâ€‘striking round for you with 14 greens and 28 putts.   It's always hard to hit greens here because there's so many crosswinds to deal with. 
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Yeah, it's hard to keep the ball in the fairways off the tee.   I think that's the number one thing.   You do have the crosswinds and the fairways get a bit bouncy, so that makes hitting greens difficult. 
Yeah, I've always felt this golf course was more about hanging in there, taking advantage of the holes that you can, because there's plenty of hard ones out there, but you need to take advantage of the couple ones that you can. 

Q.   Now, you started with a second place finish but you had to overcome some adversity in 2012 when your putter got bent on the way over here.   Now you have a new Versa Odyssey in the bag?
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Yeah, so last year the putter got bent.   We're all good this year, though.   I wrapped them up a little better with the towels.

Q.   Tell me why the change?
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well, it's got the same general looking style of the old Ping Anser putter look to it.   The people at Odyssey have been good to me.   I like their insert, I like the feel of them, and it's been a nice switch in December.

Q.   Post three more 66s you can afford some property over here. 
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Fair enough.   I like it.   Thank you.
