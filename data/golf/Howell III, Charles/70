 Q. You love this place. Did not make a bogey last year in the entire 72 holes. You're playing well this year. Tell us about it.
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, you know, the changes to course have toughened it up for sure. If nothing else, just the firmness in the greens has made it tougher. 
 I don't know if you'll see a 59 this year, although it was exciting to have last year sort of a guy shoot really low. 
 But definitely toughened it up this year.

 Q. What's been the biggest challenge for you facing the golf course?
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, there are a lot more holes you need to play a bit more conservative on. Find ourselves playing away from a some of the pins; where before when it was more of a dartboard we played a bit more aggressive to 'em.
 But the greens are so you so they're still quite firm. So there are a lot of hole locations out there that need to be getting a little bit of respect.

 Q. It's not the maturity of a full-grown green complex which takes a couple years. They've done a really good job here. Everybody talks about how good the greens are. How have you adjusted your shot hitting into the greens as far as trajectory, coming in low and lean, running out... they were running a little bit early in the week. 
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, you know, the greens are rolling perfect. I don't think anybody putted on 'em for a while, so they're rolling good. You just have to be aware of the some of the corner flags and that the ball is going to bounce through the green a bit.
 And with the added length we're not quite hitting as many wedge into the holes as we were. So it takes a bit more patience out there, I think.
