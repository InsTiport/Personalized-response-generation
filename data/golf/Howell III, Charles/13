CHARLES HOWELL III: Yes.  I do like it here.  I love the golf course.  Old-style.  A lot of different options off the tees and into the greens and whatnot.
I mean, it makes you think.  Yeah, just I've always enjoyed coming here and really enjoy the golf course.
Q. You've done really well here; obviously not won here.  Is there another course where you've done as well consistently that you've played 18 times?
CHARLES HOWELL III: I don't think so.  Maybe Torrey Pines I've had a lot of nice finishes, but not quite like this one.  It would be awfully special to win here.
The finishes I've had, it's kind of hard to explain, to be honest with you.  Typically a longer, more open golf course would suit me.  Yeah, for whatever reason it is, I've been fortunate here.
Q. Is that encouraging for you or sometimes frustrating?
CHARLES HOWELL III: No, it's all encouraging.  Are you kidding?  The competition, the guys out here and how good they're playing and all that, no, it's extremely encouraging.
Q. Pretty remarkable.  You've been here every year for 18 years.
CHARLES HOWELL III: Yes.
Q. Made the cut every year.  So many Top 10s, Top 5 finishes.
CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, Lord willing, if I stay healthy I'll never miss this one.  I can control the showing up part.
The finishes, I don't know.  But it would be awful special to one day win here.
Q. When you first came here did you ever think you would do this well here?
CHARLES HOWELL III: I like the golf course and I like the fact that it's the start of the year and I'm excited to play.  Yeah, been working on my game throughout the month of November, December and whatnot.  Always excited to play when I get here.  Beyond that, it's hard to say.
