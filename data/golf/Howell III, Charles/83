   CHARLES HOWELL III: I was on the AJGA Tour from age 13 to age 18 straight through, so I mean, it was very big in my development as a player. So my relationship with him has continued strong, and Steve Hamlin, who is the head of the AJGA, and I have remained friends, and he approached me a couple years ago about an idea to have a tournament in Augusta with my name on it. 
 I mean, it's more of an honor and it's flattering that they'd even ask me to do that, frankly. But growing up in Augusta with a tournament in Augusta, it fits really well. Unfortunately I'm not there, I'm here at the John Deere. But on top of that, I knew that Drew was leading after yesterday, so to hear he's going to win the thing is awesome. Davis being not only a friend of mine but someone I have looked up to, to see his son win it is pretty cool.
