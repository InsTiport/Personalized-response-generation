 Q.  Charles, what a great way to start this tournament, I mean 5-under for the day with some changing weather conditions out there, too, for you.  
CHARLES HOWELL, III: Yeah.  When we teed off it was a little bit nasty and breezy and as the day went on it kind of warmed up a bit and the wind laid down for our last 6, 7 holes.  The scoring conditions are awfully good right now and today was the day where you needed to take advantage of it.   
 Q.  Do we go back to the first hole and your second shot into No. 1, dumping in it there for a 2 on the par 4?  
CHARLES HOWELL, III: Yeah.  I drove it in the right bunker off the tee and had 128 in and hit a wedge off the backstop.  It was moving when it hit the flag.  It was a good thing it hit the flag or it was going to be off the front edge, probably.  I'll take luck any day.   
 Q.  How about the condition that this course is in for the tournament this year, your evaluation this year?  
CHARLES HOWELL, III: It's fantastic.  Last year we were somewhat under water.  The condition is great.  The greens are wonderful.  Hopefully the rain is over now and start to dry up and firm up a little bit, which it seems to be.  It handled the rain this morning quite well.   
 Q.  Great playing, good luck the rest of the day.  
CHARLES HOWELL, III: Thank you.
