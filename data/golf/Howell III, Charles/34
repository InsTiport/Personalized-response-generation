Q. Good start today, you have an affinity with this golf course, what is it about this place that you seem to perform well here all the time?
CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, I've played here enough years where I've about seen and done it all around here.  So you know, I really like the golf course.  There's no real tricks to it.  But we know it's tough from the word go.
Now Tuesday, we played and it was extremely firm and fast, and with the rains last night and this morning, it played about as easy as this place will play.  The remainder of the week, as it starts to dry out a bit, I think it will get a bit tougher but it was out there early this morning.
Q. Seven birdies today and three to finish, that's a nice way to close the round?
CHARLES HOWELL III: I'll always take that, right.  It was a nice finish to the day.  I was able to hole a couple nice putts there coming in.  But even with the rains overnight, the greens held up.  They were pretty smooth this morning but as we saw last year, it doesn't take double digits to win here.  So it's about managing your game and pars are good scores.
Q. With your game, is this the type of course that you really look forward to coming to, especially having had success?
CHARLES HOWELL III: I do like it because pars are good scores.  And if you are able to make a couple birdies in there, they go a long way.  And the whole entire field knows that.  So that's why you've seen the winning scores here not get too low throughout the year, so I do like that.
