Q.   Talk about your round today. 
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   I hung in there well today.   I didn't have my best stuff out there, but I hung in there well.   And I think that partly out here, you just know always that you got to make a bunch of birdies. 
So I hung in there and I made a couple at the end, which was nice to have a fighting chance tomorrow maybe. 

Q.   Does that affect your mindset going into the final round being five back?
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   No, because you still have to play.   You still have to play a round of golf, and that really doesn't matter once you tee it up on the first hole. 
So, no, I just got to go play as well as I can play.
