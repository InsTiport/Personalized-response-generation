  CHARLES HOWELL, III:   I mean it was good today.   It was a little bit windy early, which around here is fairly commonplace, but it wasn't ‑‑ didn't really pick up, you know, maybe till our sixth or seventh hole, so we got to get a little bit in the calm.   
You know, there's a long way to go yet, though.  
   
 Q.   So five birdies, one bogey today.   Was it something specifically that clicked today?   Do you feel you've been playing well?  
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   You know, it's hard to say.   This golf course, it really keeps your attention off the tees.   There's a lot of trouble out there, and it's too hard to get ahead of yourself here.   The golf course almost helps you stay where you're at just because it demands a lot of focus and attention on it.  
And you know, fortunately I was able to drive the ball in play today, and that gives you a good chance around here to score.  
   
 Q.   (Question in Spanish)?  
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   A little bit.  
   
 Q.   You played in the morning today.   Obviously the wind, as you said, was a little bit okay.   Tomorrow you play in the afternoon.   The wind might be a little harder?  
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Any change in strategy at all tomorrow?  
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   Just gotta pay more attention to it.   And I mean as you said, it's meant to get windy tomorrow, but yeah, I think most of the guys have been here enough, and you kind of expect it.   
I don't think I've ever played the golf course when it was calm, so I think it's a good part of the golf course and it's to be expected.   And there's a lot of hard holes out here.   Pars are not bad scores when it gets breezy.
