Q. Another solid day for you here in Hawai'i.  Your thoughts?
CHARLES HOWELL III: The course is playing about as easy as it can play.  Of all the years I've been here, this is the calmest I've seen it for two consecutive days.  So the scores are out there.  I didn't see a 59, but I think the guys this afternoon will go low.
Q. You have a really successful record around here.  What is it that seems to work?
CHARLES HOWELL III: I'm not sure.  I'd love to figure it out.  Maybe I've had some time off to work on my game a little bit back home.  But I've always liked it here.  I love the golf course.  Different style than kind of we play a lot of, but now the fairways are fast and firm and they are running and it makes you think a bit.
Q. Game is certainly trending in the right direction.  What's the secret?
CHARLES HOWELL III: I wish I had one.  This game's just too hard.
