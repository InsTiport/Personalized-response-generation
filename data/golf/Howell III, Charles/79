  Q. Just some overall thoughts on the day today.   
 CHARLES HOWELL, III: La Quinta, this is a tricky place, it's not the easiest of the rotation, I don't think, by a long shot.   
 And 2-under is okay. I'm not totally displeased with that round. And on paper it looks short, but you have to lay back off so many tees that you got a lot of 6 and 7-irons into holes and it's not always easy to get the ball close out here. It's a tricky little thing.   
  
  Q. You made bogey on 9?  
 CHARLES HOWELL, III: Yes.  
  
  Q. Just your second of the week. Talk about what you attribute that consistent play to.   
 CHARLES HOWELL, III: My short game's been good this week, I got the ball up-and-down a couple of times where I missed greens and had to save it.   
 But I've tried to play smart, I think in years past I've probably played a little too aggressively here, gone at too many corner flags and made some bogeys.   
 And at the same time though you got to make birdies to keep climbing up that leaderboard. You got to figure that 28 to 30-under is going to win. So I got a little bit of work ahead of us the next couple of days.
