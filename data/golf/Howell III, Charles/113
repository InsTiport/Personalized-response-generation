   CHARLES HOWELL III:  I would love for that to be the case, yes.  Just from a sports fan, I would loved to see the ball stay in what Tiger would have done, wouldn't we all.  That doesn't happen against Tiger very often.   
But no, I love the golf course, I love the fact that pars go a long way.  I love the fact that it doesn't take 30-under to win here.  You look at where the rough is and as penal as it is, 11-under is leading.  By the time the USGA gets ahold of this thing, it's going to be pretty neat.   
  
  Q.  How forward to you look to playing with Tiger tomorrow?   
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  Any time you're playing with Tiger on Sunday you're doing something right.  Obviously he's the front runner.  He's your guy that historically he does pretty well.  I'm looking forward to playing with him tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Is he the rabbit, two shots back?   
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  I thought he was Tiger, not a rabbit.  But he's your front runner for sure.  Keep an eye on him but if I play my game and do the best I can, it will be fine.
