 Q. You made a nice bounce back at the 9th and put together a pretty solid round. How did it feel?
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Pretty good. The golf course this morning was soft. There wasn't much wind. You could get close to some of the flags today, but it's so hard to get close to these pins. They're on the edges of the slopes, and the greens look big but there's so much slope in them, it's actually quite hard to get the ball close.

 Q. Give us a sense of how you think the course is going to be over the weekend. We know that par is a very good score. What do you think is going to happen?
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, I think it'll dry up a bit. I think it'll start getting a little bouncier, a little firmer. I think as it dries out -- par is a heck of a score. It has a little bit of a major/U.S. Open type feel to it. It's a heck of a test.

 Q. Do you like courses like this?
 CHARLES HOWELL III: I do, I like it, because birdies can move you along. Par is not a bad score. Yeah, it's a hard test out there.
