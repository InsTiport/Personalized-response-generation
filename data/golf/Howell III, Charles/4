Q. Charles, two birdies coming in. 66 today. Give yourself a fighting chance tomorrow, but I know a lot depends on what happens later today.
CHARLES HOWELL, III: Yeah. You know, it's just such an odd week with like how the weather has been and all that. Yeah, I mean, really pleased with how I played today. You get these rain showers coming in and the wind and it just doesn't seem quite like Hawaii.
Yeah, I mean, Listen, it's a long shot fighting chance. Obviously take a special day tomorrow. Yeah, nonetheless, here. And if Kevin goes out, Kis and those guys, they're at 8, and they have a good day, be hard to catch them. We'll see.
Q. And just comment on the conditions you faced again today?
CHARLES HOWELL, III: Well, it's just so different for here. Like we're just not used to this. This is my 19th or 20th. Just never seen it like this. So many holes are playing so much differently, and you can see it in the scoring. Golf course has a lot of teeth to it.
But, yeah, the guys of at the top have kind the gritty grinders up there, and you can see it from the weather.
