Q.   Talk about   your round. 
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   Well, you know, there wasn't much wind today.   Early on the greens were a little softer than normal so it was gettable in spots. 
The hole locations coming down the stretch are tough.   I mean, 15 and 17 aren't easy birdies today, and 16 is a fairly accessible flag but it's 16. 
Yeah, I gave it a run to try and get a couple more coming in, but I'm very pleased.

Q.   You have had four top 10s in your last eight starts and lining up another one here.   What's been the secret to the improved play?
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   Well, you know, we have been driving the ball a little bit better and then holing the putts I need to hole.   You know as a player that when you can make that nice putt for par sometimes it keeps the momentum going.
Guys out here, they are getting so darn good now that you have got to be good at everything, really.
