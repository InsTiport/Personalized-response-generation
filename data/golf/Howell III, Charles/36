 Q.  Two 69s.  What went right for you these two days?  
CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, you know, this morning the conditions were awfully good to play.  The greens were definitely bouncier than last year.   
I think as the weekend comes on, if it stays sunny they're going to get a bit bouncy.  It gets interesting out there.  There is a lot of slope in these things.  You got to think your way around.   
 Q.  Just to make it clear for our listeners understand what bouncy is.  You mean firm?  
CHARLES HOWELL III: For sure, right.  Exactly.  Last year they were quite soft.  This year they're quite a bit firmer.  Especially the first hop on 'em kicks out quite a bit.   
If it stays sunny and kind of warm like this it'll be a challenge on the weekends.   
 Q.  How were the hole locations out there today?  Some pretty tough ones?  
CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, there was a nice mix.  There are a few of 'em where if you drive the ball in the fairway and you get it in the right spot you can really take advantage of it.   
Hence you saw some guys yesterday shoot 8-, 9-under.  I didn't see that out there, but apparently they did.   
Be interesting to see how those guys do this afternoon.   
 Q.  What do you do in your time off between coming out here to Napa?  
CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, I practiced.  I need to practice.  A lot of these guys out here are getting awfully good.  I'm not good enough to take time off.  I need to work.
