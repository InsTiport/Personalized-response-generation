CHARLES HOWELL III: Those are the things that happen and seemingly in match play playoffs, right, where he makes a great up and down to make 4 and I three-putt and keep going.  Like that shank I had yesterday to keep the match going, right, and you're just like, how does this happen?  And it finds a way to happen and it's gone.
Q. (Inaudible.)
CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, a few things had to go my way today.  I'm playing Jon tomorrow who is arguably the hottest golfer right now on the golf course.  Yeah, I'm going to have to play really well to have a chance to beat the guy.
Q. (Inaudible.)
CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, I and seem to make things harder than they need to be a lot.  But I fortunately survive somehow.  Yeah, I'm excited to play Jon tomorrow.  He's playing great golf.  On this golf course it's such a risk reward type course, anything can happen.  But I'm going to keep playing well.
Q. (Inaudible.)
CHARLES HOWELL III: I haven't, I know it's really good, though.  Being 67, I'll move up 18 spots or so.  I know I need to have a really good week here.
Q. You've gone through this a couple of weeks now.  Is the pressure a little lighter now because you've done it?
CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, it does a little bit of both.  It builds in a sense of I really want to play there again, and oddly enough even having children for the par-3 contest on Wednesday, I think about that stuff now.  Where there's a lot of reasons I want to get back there.  And it's my favorite tournament in the world.
I'm biased because I grew up there, and grew up walking around that golf course.  Yeah, missing out quite a lot on it here recently, just on the wrong side of the bubble.  In a way it makes you want to get back there even more.
