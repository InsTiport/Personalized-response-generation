CHARLES HOWELL: It was a tough day out there.  Obviously the winds were up, as I'm sure everybody saw some funny-looking shots out there.  It was a tough day.  We were glad it was match play today.
Q. Your particular group, Tyrrell has won two matches out of two.  It's in his hands.  If he stumbles tomorrow against Rafa Cabrera Bello, Rafa would have two points and Hatton would have two points.  And if you beat Jeunghun Wang, you would have two points then.
CHARLES HOWELL: I'm glad you just explained all that to me.  That's why we play golf.  We're not that smart to figure all that out.  It could be a good day.  Rafa is playing great.  I played Tyrrell yesterday and he's playing solid golf.  He drove it great yesterday.  Rafa has got his hands full with him, but he is a Ryder Cupper.
Q. How about the golf course design, do you like it?
CHARLES HOWELL: I do.  It's great for match play.  There's a lot of risk-reward out there.  The guys are taking some shots that they probably wouldn't normally.  Yeah, the design for the tournament is perfect.
Q. So your group is going to be very exciting tomorrow.  It could be three of you going for one spot Saturday?
CHARLES HOWELL: Why wouldn't it be?
