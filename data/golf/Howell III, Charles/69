   CHARLES HOWELL: It played about as easy as it could play, not much wind out there, a bit of humidity so the greens were holding. I'm not sure how it'll be the rest of the week, but I thought today was definitely a good day to shoot a low number.

 Q. Is there any less pressure going out there today being 26th in the FedExCup standings coming into the day?
 CHARLES HOWELL: Yeah, probably a bit less pressure for me probably because I finally played my way back into Augusta. That was a big goal for me this year, so this tournament is in a way just a bit of a reward. I don't have much of a chance to win the FedExCup, although I'd love to, but yeah, I mean, a bit less pressure in that sense. Still, though, it's -- I don't know if that makes it easier or harder. 

 Q. Those saves you had on 10, 11 and 16, talk about what that meant. 
 CHARLES HOWELL: Yeah, I didn't play particularly well last week in Chicago, good enough to get here, but I did a lot of work early in the week. The start for me was the most important. I know I had good saves on those holes, but just to get off to a decent start and sort of calm things down a bit, and then you're going to have to make some saves around here. There's too many difficult holes and tee shots, you're not going to hit every fairway. Yeah, that was nice. The greens are so perfect. If there's a week for a guy to putt great, this is the week. I think these are the best greens we've played all year.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 CHARLES HOWELL: Yeah, it was a good shot that got lucky. You've got to hit a good shot, but then there's a bit of luck for it to go in. I probably deserved more of a 3 than a 2 after the tee shot.
