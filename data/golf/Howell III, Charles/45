Q.   Finishing 10 under today, how do you feel about your play?
CHARLES HOWELL III:   It was a nice day today.   I hung in there well.   You know, I would have liked to have got a couple more there coming down the stretch, but you know, the leaders were pretty far out there today.   They were going to be awfully hard to catch. 

Q.   Any highlights, long putts, saves?
CHARLES HOWELL III:   You know, I actually played pretty solid today.   I made a nice save for par on 17 to sort of keep the round at 10 under, but yeah, I played pretty steady today, nothing unusually exciting.

Q.   With the threat of rain yesterday, how is weather holding up today?
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Oh, yeah, the weather is perfect.   Back to Hawai'i.
