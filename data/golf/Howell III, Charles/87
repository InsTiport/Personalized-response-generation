  Q. You had a beautiful front nine. It just hadn't been drafting right?  
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, I don't know really what to say. I'm just pretty frustrated. I got up to 15, I thought 15 or 16 would win it. And I just I don't know what to say. There are times I think I look at the positives though of this one, but it's frustrating.  
  
  Q. It always comes down to the putter, doesn't it?   
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, yeah. I played well, I got myself in position. I was 4 back for the day. I caught Jerry pretty quick. And I just did not quite get it done. But I still had a lot of good shots down the stretch. I still gave myself chances for birdie. I've just got to keep working on that.   
  
  Q. Charles, this is a frustrating day. Talk to me about it.   
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, it's frustrating. I got up to 15, and you know, had every chance to do it, and I just didn't finish it off. But, yeah, I got close.  
  
  Q. You turned at 5 under par, you get it to 15, and I thought you had a lot of quality shots down the stretch. What happened on 17?   
 CHARLES HOWELL III: You know, I've had a similar putt to that earlier in the week over that hill, and it wasn't as quick as I thought it would have been.   
 Yeah, the last five or six feet of that putt, the greens changed a bit, and I thought it would be as quick as it was. I don't know if it hit something or not, but either way, I thought it wasn't a bad putt, but it didn't go in. So I've just got to keep working.
