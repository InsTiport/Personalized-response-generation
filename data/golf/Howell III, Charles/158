CHARLES HOWELL III:  If I had made a few pars in there it could have been a lot different. 

Q.  Talk about the shot on the back.
CHARLES HOWELL III:  The shot on No. 16, I caught two flyers and I haven't caught two flyers in the last two years, I don't think.  So that ball there, I had a really good lie in the rough and he had a bad lie.  I thought I hit the next ball in.

Q.  What's it like playing someone in your peer group; fun?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  It was fun.  I didn't win; so, it's not fun.  But it was fun.  I think we both wanted to beat each other.

Q.  Talk about the waggle.
CHARLES HOWELL III:  That's just his little thing there.    I kind of expected it.  I wasn't paying attention to it.  I counted a few of them just for fun. 

Q.  Does that bother you at all?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  Not at all.  I'm so worried about my own game ... the cart path, I didn't want to drop it and get it down in the junk there, so I just thought I'd get a better lie.

Q.  Is it more meaningful to you, this match, the way it was billed; here is a guy who is actually younger than you, a potential rival  -- did you understand that?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  Oh, I think we both did.  We both wanted to beat each other.  There's no question about that.  You know, the 18th hole there, I don't think either one of us played our best today, but just one of those things. 

Q.  How could you compare match-play versus Sunday on stroke-play, the gamesmanship?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  You might clear your throat a little bit, but it wasn't really that bad with Sergio and I because we are friends.  I think if you're playing someone out there you don't like too much, then you might drop your hat a few times.

Q.  A comment on the waggle?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  Exactly. 

Q.  As you were walking to 18, what happened there?
CHARLES HOWELL III: I think both of us started  -- we hit a few bad shots and that probably made us more mad than anything.  But no, I think we are both just trying to grind it out there because neither one of us had our best stuff. 
Just a by-product of wanting to win and when you want to win that bad.  Neither one of us  -- except we were not making birdies toward the last few holes. 

Q.  First time you ever played Sergio?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  In match-play.  I've played him a bunch of times. 

Q.  Are you thinking about adopting the waggle?
CHARLES HOWELL III: No.  I'm going to stick with my waggle. 

Q.  Could you describe your emotions on 18, satisfied, frustrated?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  A little bit pissed off because I didn't really play my best today, and it's nothing against Sergio, but I didn't play my best today.  I just, you know, if you play really good and lose that's one thing, but when you don't play that well and lose  -- which I guess is good for me.  If I had played my very best golf and lost, I wouldn't be very happy. 
I thought I drove it real good, but I hit a couple funky iron shots which I didn't really like.  I felt I drove it good when I needed to drive it good.  Just a couple iron shots that I didn't like.

Q.  On 18 you were sitting pretty  --?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  18, it just played longer than I expected.  I had a perfect yardage.  I had 124 to the hole and 137 to the back and just a smooth wedge.  I had a perfect shot for a smooth wedge. 

Q.  What did you hit it to, 25 feet?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  Yeah. 

Q.  People talk about you and Sergio being the future, what's your thought about that?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  I never really had momentum.  When I got to all-square, I think I had a little bit of momentum there.  Then but when I lost that hole, I think it slipped right back to him.

Q.  What will you do after this?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  I'll probably just go back to Orlando for a couple of days.
