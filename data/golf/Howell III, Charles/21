CHARLES HOWELL III: We were kind of back and forth early, nothing really good or really bad for either one of us.  And then I made a birdie on 10.   
And then the one on 12, I think, really swung it a little bit in my favor.   
With that said, you're playing Phil Mickelson, you never know what might happen.  I still expect him to roll three or four birdies in a row playing somebody like that.  He makes you fight right to the end.   
 Q.  You said "somebody like that," when you put a feather in your cap of Phil Mickelson's caliber, what does that do for your confidence moving forward in this championship?  
CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, you know, I was fortunate today, obviously, to get past him.  But with this pod play the way it goes now, you never know.  You've got to keep playing good.  Last WGC we had, he won.  So he's never out of it.
