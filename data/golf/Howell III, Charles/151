Q.  After you made the turn you started to settle down.  Did the course conditions change or did you settle down?
CHARLES HOWELL:   I settled down a bit.  The course conditions played the same.  The more you play and the more you get used to it, they get somewhat easier.  Obviously we have not played in this kind of weather; playing in Orlando and Las Vegas was pretty much perfect weather; so it's a change. 
Fortunately we had the ball lift, clean and place, which was a pretty big deal.  I had a lot of drives to plug and that makes a difference.  A lot of three-quarter shots, low tournament shots, a lot of shots you had to hit.

Q.  Had the greens firmed up? 
CHARLES HOWELL:   The greens were quite a bit firmer and faster than even yesterday and I'm sure they will continue doing that.  A lot of the putts, downhill putts were really quick.  They are getting up to East Lake speed.

Q.  Have you allowed yourself to think that your second win might be THE TOUR Championship?
CHARLES HOWELL:   No, it's hard to even feel like this is Thursday, playing twosomes.  Just one day at a time.  There's 30 of the best players in the world here so it will take a lot of work.
