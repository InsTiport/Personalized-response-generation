Q. Winning right here on 18.  In and around the greens with the conditions, how difficult was it for you to perform at your best?
CHARLES HOWELL: Difficult enough to cause a shank.  That was all the wind.
Q. I wasn't going to ask you about that.
CHARLES HOWELL: It happened.  It was a bit numb playing this last hole here after that.  Fortunately, I got a nice up and down at the last hole to save it a little bit.
Q. You really wanted to be here, you wanted to play in this event.  Why?
CHARLES HOWELL: It's basically a qualification for the Masters.  I'm not in the field so far, but I've got to get to the semis to make it there.  I've got a lot of work ahead of me with these players out here.  Today was a good day.
Q. Given what happened back on 17, how proud are you?
CHARLES HOWELL: It was a bit numb playing the last.  It was a tough bunker shot and I was trying to hit a big ole flop shot in there and stop it.  It was nice to suck it up a bit and make it up at the last.
Q. Now, given the scenario, there is a chance for a three-way playoff tomorrow.  How many were you thinking about that today?
CHARLES HOWELL: Yeah, I really don't quite know the format.  I know I need to play well to win.  This is my first year with this round-robin deal.  That means I need to go have a good day tomorrow.
Q. Are you happy with the way the ball is coming out or are you've got a bit of work to do?
CHARLES HOWELL: I've actually driven the ball nicely the first two days.  Today was a rough day.  If you miss the greens here, it's hard to get the ball up and down.  You've got to hit the balls in the middle of the greens here.  Still in this wind and these conditions, some holes are being won with par.
