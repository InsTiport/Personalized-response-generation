  Q. Pretty nice round, 5-under par 67 and you get it in before the rain, that's nice.   
 CHARLES HOWELL: Well, it is nice to get in before the rain today for sure. It was good today. It was nice playing with David who got rolling as well.   
 It's nice to have another guy in your group you kind of press each other along. And it's good to see some other guys hole some putts and try to feed off their momentum.  
  
  Q. Plus you got a chance to make some birdies. Last week was such a struggle. What are the differences between-- or do you try to put that stuff behind you?  
 CHARLES HOWELL: The greens here are excellent. You know they've done a phenomenal job even with the drought and et cetera. But the greens are incredible so if you do hit the ball well you are going to have your chances. You can hole some putts. It's just a matter of taking advantage of it.  
  
  Q. Charles, good luck. Thanks for your time.   
 CHARLES HOWELL: Thank you very much.  
  
  Q. The rain was just coming when you came in. The course was in pretty good shape as you were coming in?  
 CHARLES HOWELL: The golf course was fine. I think the greens are fantastic. The tees are fine and the fairways with what they had to deal with were grade. The golf course is in great shape. That's never the issue here.  
  
  Q. Did you play it up? (Inaudible).   
 CHARLES HOWELL: Yeah. When I drove in the fairway, yeah. When I could take advantage of it, for sure, absolutely. But really never made much of a difference today. It does get wet out there. If it does get soft, it will make a little bigger difference.
