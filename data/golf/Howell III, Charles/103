 Q.  Talking about the course. 

 CHARLES HOWELL, III:  The golf course is hard.  And today, with the greens still firm and fast, it was difficult.  Birdies are tough to come by today. 

 Adam Scott and I didn't play that bad to shoot 3- and 4-over. 

 There just aren't many birdie holes out there.  13 and 15 aren't as reachable as they have been in the past. 

 The one reachable par-5 was No. 2. 

 The only other time I remember the weather like this is when I'm here playing for Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

 Q.  How was it this morning? 

 CHARLES HOWELL, III:  It wasn't quite as cold as I thought.  With the first time being at 10:00 it was okay.  Now if it had been 8:00 a.m., it would have been a different story. 

 Q.  Regarding the rough. 

 CHARLES HOWELL, III:  The rough actually kind of helps keep the ball in play, so I don't mind it.  I just felt that par was a helluva score today. 

 You know the tapes we have all seen of guys shooting 30 on the back nine?  I don't think you're going to see that tape this year. 

 I wish the par-5 on 13 and 15 were playing differently.  It would make it more exciting, but they are playing straight into the wind.
