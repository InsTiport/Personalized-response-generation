Q.   Another top 5 finish for you.   This is the seventh time you've finished here in the top 5 at the Sony Open. 
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well, you know, it was a tough task today to try to catch these guys.   You know, when you start off that far behind, and obviously they're playing good golf, and in looking on the leaderboard early, Russell didn't falter one bit.   You know, I didn't really see 23‑under out there, I can assure you that.

Q.   And yet you played well yourself.   You hit 14 greens, had 29 putts, shoot 4‑under par in the final round. 
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Yeah, I did a lot of things good today and this week, and for the first week out, you know, it's‑‑ no matter how much you work in the off‑season you never quite feel prepared or ready to go.   You just have to go at some point in time.   But no, you know, I was excited to get here and get out there, and I was glad we got in with a decent score today.

Q.   Should be a good jump start for your season. 
CHARLES HOWELL III:   I certainly hope so, so thank you. 

Q.   Is this the easiest conditions you've seen out here? 
CHARLES HOWELL III:   You know what, last year I think we had a day or so where it was calm, as well.   I've actually‑‑ it's almost bizarre, though, to see it calm out here.   It's bizarre because we're so used to playing it with the wind.   But there's a few holes that are actually more difficult because some holes we rely on a bit of the wind to help, etcetera.   But yeah, it's still tricky out there, though.
