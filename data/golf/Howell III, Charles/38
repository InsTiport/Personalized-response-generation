 Q.  Great round today, got off to a wonderful start.  What was working for you today?  CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, when you come here, you know that the course is -- it gives up a lot of birdies and the score has got to be good.  You've got to take advantage of it.  This morning the conditions were about as ideal as you can get.  You know, I hit a lot of greens today.  I think I hit 17 of 18.  You need to be putting for birdies out here.  Of course I was able to do that today.  I haven't played very well the last four to six weeks, but today was a lot better.   Q.  Talk a little bit about the conditions.  CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, there wasn't much wind this morning, and it's oddly cool for this time of year here.  Usually we're roasting.  But no, conditions were almost ideal this morning.  It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but it certainly sets up if you do play well to shoot a low one.   Q.  And then looking forward, what do you think it's going to take?  CHARLES HOWELL III: Oh, man.  Well, even if you look at the scoreboard now, again, it would be -- I would guess 16 to 18-under probably will win, which means it's got to be a few more days like today, but scores are always low here, so you never know, but it'll be a lot.   Q.  Good position going into tomorrow.  What are you going to be working on?  CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, it was actually nice just to play a good round of golf, to be honest, and a lot of time now will be spent a lot on putting.  You've got to putt well around here, especially as low as the scores tend to be.  Yeah, a little bit of everything.
