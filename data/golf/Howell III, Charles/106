 Q.  After the Tavistock Cup, how will you prepare for Augusta? 
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  I'll go one day next week to play; then I'll probably go up the Sunday before, just have a few quiet practice rounds.  I'll have one of Lead's guys come up there with me and spend a couple of days together. 

 Q.  Is it the one major where you need more preparation than most on that particular golf course because it's hard to simulate it somewhere else? 
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  What makes Augusta National special is the fact that there's really not many else of them, so, yeah, especially tee-to-green, I think we all know that, but around the greens and bunkers and chipping. 

 Q.  When you do a practice round up there, do you do the Phil, eight-hour thing, or do you make it more leisurely than that? 
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  I spend a lot of time, I don't know how many hours I spend on it.  You know, you're out there to work.  You're definitely not out there just to go out and have a good time.  I don't have a time period, but it takes a bit of time, yeah. 

 Q.  Are you almost relieved that the run-up is kind of done and now you can really start focussing? 
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  Not really, because this is a big event and Bay Hill is a big event.  I think it helps to keep you focused on the present because of the big tournaments leading up to it.  So granted, now obviously the focus does go to the Masters for sure. 
 But relief, I don't know, because now the real work starts.  You know, you've got the Masters coming up and that place is -- it can be very mean.
