 Q.  That was a really classy way to finish off the match there with the final putt on 17. 
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  It was tough.  My last seven holes, I had six birdies, so it was a tough match and Stuart played well.  Just I had the putter working a little bit better at the end. 

 Q.  What special memories are you going to take away from this, your second Presidents Cup team? 
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  You know, it's more the stuff off the golf course.  It's amazing how much pressure you feel on the course just because you're playing for a team and for a country.  But, yeah, I mean, the memories off the golf course, you just get to know these guys a whole lot better and they have all got a lot in common.
