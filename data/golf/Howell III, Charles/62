  CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well, yeah, it was a tough day, especially this morning.   It was kind of cool, and we've seen I think two of the four seasons so far this week.   But it was a lot different this morning with the temperature and things like that.   Pars were a good score early.   The only saving grace was the greens were soft, but I'm quite sure that'll change come tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Do you change anything going into tomorrow?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   No, it's still a really hard golf course, and pars are really good scores.  
   
 Q.   Did you prepare for this year any different than you had coming into any other Masters?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   No.   More praying maybe.   
   
 Q.   Are you doing anything with family this week?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Staying with family, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Childhood bedroom?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   No, the place has been redone.   I wouldn't recognize it if you just dropped me there.  
   
 Q.   Was there a Larry Mize poster in there growing up?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   No, Greg Norman.   
   
 Q.   Are the kids going to come out at all this week?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   I don't know.   It's a lot.   They came up for the par‑3, and it got canceled.  
   
 Q.   If you win they'll run out?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well, yeah, but that's a long way away.   
   
 Q.   I hate to bring up a bad memory, but you made a 9 on No.11 in 2006.   Can you recount that?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Yeah, I missed about a six‑footer for an 8.   
   
 Q.   Is it a hole that haunted you at all, that you thought about afterward?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Yeah, it's not something I really think about.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel snakebit here or‑‑  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   No, I was making a joke.   You need to relax.   
   
 Q.   I don't know if you were joking, you might have been, that you never really feel comfortable here.   
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Yeah.   I really don't.   It's a hard golf course.   It's set up right on the edge of playable but very difficult, and it's hard to ever feel really comfortable here.   
You know, I know some players like a Mickelson, I've heard him say a lot of times he feels great and really comfortable every time he gets to Augusta, and it's a place I've never been 100 percent at ease with yet.   
   
 Q.   There were easier hole locations today.   Was the wind the main challenge?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   What golf course were you watching?   You thought the hole locations were easy?   
   
 Q.   Well, compared to yesterday.   
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well, a little bit, but you're reaching.   
   
 Q.   I saw 9.   9 is about the toughest spot on that green there.   What others were Sunday‑like?   
CHARLES HOWELL III:   I mean, back left on 6 is not easy; 4, just over the bunker.   I mean, they're where they're at for a reason.   They're not easy.   Back on 11.   They're not easy.  
   
 Q.   Both yesterday and today similarly set up?   
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Today might have been a touch easier, but I'm not going to use the word easy around here.   They're a touch different today.   
   
 Q.   When you were a kid I'm assuming you played a number of rounds here?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   And did you feel the same way you do now?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   No, it's a lot more fun when the ropes aren't up and it's not a golf tournament.   It's just different.   I think you can enjoy the golf course then a bit more.   I really didn't appreciate the difficulty until I played the tournament.   All the rounds I played that weren't in the tournament, it was just different, just the feel changes a bit.   The greens may speed up a little bit, but not really.   Just the whole feel of it's different.   
   
 Q.   Did you come in for pre‑tournament practice?   
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Monday and Tuesday the week before, yeah.   We played two days.  
   
 Q.   18?  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   18 and 18, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Did Bo's experience last year sort of give you a lift, seeing‑‑  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   Well, I was awfully excited watching him on TV because he eagled 13 and 15 on Sunday and he tied for the lead or 16 tee.   So I was rooting hard for him, and that was fun to watch.   
   
 Q.   You guys are friends, you're pretty comparable, you've got to feel like he can do it, I can do it, sort of like when Charl thought that after Louis‑‑  
CHARLES HOWELL III:   I never thought that, I was just more excited for him because I know what the tournament means and means to everyone.   It was pretty cool watching everyone make two eagles on the back nine on Sunday.
