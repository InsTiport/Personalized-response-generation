Q. Charles, today was a day of survival.  Tough wind conditions, really right from the get-go when you teed off.
CHARLES HOWELL, III: Yeah.  This course is not easy and especially with the wind blowing around and the swirling.  Yeah.  I was hoping we would get about 9 holes in this morning without wind but we did didn't.  Just hung in there, do the best you can do with it and pars are okay.
Q. Pars are okay and a couple of bogies, one birdie for you.  But you're only two off the lead.
That's got to make you feel pretty good going into the weekend even though you didn't have your best day.
CHARLES HOWELL, III: It will be interesting what the leaders do this afternoon.  If the wind does lay down you get 5, 6-underish.  This place is tough.  It has a Major feel to it with how difficult it's playing right now.
Q. Good job today.  Survival of the fitness.  Best of luck this weekend.
CHARLES HOWELL, III: Thank you.
