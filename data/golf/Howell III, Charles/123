Q.
Was this kind of like a round at Isleworth today?  How was that?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  It was a round at Isleworth with a few more gallery out there.  Obviously we've played together quite a lot, and he's still hitting it as far as he always does.  I think it's a little further, though, in competition than at home.  He just really wants to rub it in.
Q.  How much fun is it to play with Tiger?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  It's the best.  There's nothing better.  Obviously he is the best player in the world, and he shows every day why.  It's great.  I always learn something when I do play with him.

Yeah, I was hoping we could play together again tomorrow, but of course he's got to birdie the last hole in typical Tiger fashion.
Q.  What was that on 9?  Was he trying to rub it in?
CHARLES HOWELL III:  I think you'll have that ask him about that.
Q.  He had 2 over 370 on the downhill holes.  You were up there on the slope where you're supposed to be, and he was
CHARLES HOWELL III:  Straight down.
