  Q.  Fantastic finish.   
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  I was very fortunate to get -- to even have a chance to win at 2-down with two to go.  Stephen birdied 17 and I was fortunate to hit it up there to be able to make a 3.  In a situation like that, 2-down with two to go against these players, you don't feel like you're going to have a chance to win, and today was one of those days where it went my way and I was able to.   
  
  Q.  Stephen came in, and seeing a lot of emotions of players that have won and lost coming into the locker room, he came in smiling and laughing about finishing and saying, that's kind of match play.   
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  It kind of is.  I got some momentum going there at the end to finish eagle-birdie-birdie, and it's match play.  It's just kind of how this thing goes.  Stephen played very well today.  He didn't hit a bad shot.  You know, it was going to take good golf to beat him and play that consistent and steady, and it took me just a lot longer to get going.   
  
  Q.  A tournament like this, getting through the first round, is there suddenly kind of a monkey off your back?  Do you feel like you can get rolling now just getting through the first round?   
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  Unfortunately, no.  In this tournament each round is a battle.  You're playing against guys that are just too good.  Match play always shows that anybody can beat anybody, and on top of that, you're playing guys that are such good players.   
 The combination of those two things, no.  Every day is a battle to keep having a tee time the next day.   
  
  Q.  Still nice to know you're playing tomorrow, though, right?   
 CHARLES HOWELL III:  Absolutely.  Any win is a good win.
