Q.   Good round today, 65 for you, I know you wanted that last putt to go in, but you finished strong, put yourself right in position. 
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   Well, thank you.   It's amazing how low the scores are here every year, and you kind of forget, and then you come back and you just got to keep making birdies.
The guys are too good, and with the weather like this, they're going to shoot low on every course.   So it was just nice to hang in there for a bit. 

Q.   You got an opportunity now to play at the Palmer Course twice in a row, do you like that setup knowing that you're going to be on the same track for the next couple days?
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   I do.   I think you'll probably see the lower scores on the Nicklaus Course tomorrow, but the Palmer Course, you have to play a good round to stay in it.   But as you know, there's 36 more holes there, so a whole lot more birdies guys are going to be making.

Q.   The talk right now is about all the young guys, you got to rise up and represent the alumni class a little bit, don't you?
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   I remember when I used to be 22.   No, they're playing awesome.   Russell Henley, I sure didn't see 24-under last week that he shot and obviously, he got off to a good start here this week.
So they're good players and then they're ready to win when they come out of college, which says a lot for our college system and man, they're awful good.   I got to play good just to hang in there with them.

Q.   How is your game and what are you working on for tomorrow?
CHARLES HOWELL, III:   The game's good.   I putted well the first couple days, so I got to keep doing that obviously around here.   But, yeah, just keep getting better at everything.
