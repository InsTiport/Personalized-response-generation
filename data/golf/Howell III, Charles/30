Q. Birdie at 18, you get in at 5-under 67.  I know there was a lot of starting and stopping.  How pleased are you with a 67?
CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, very pleased.  You know, there was a bit of wind early this morning, and those first few holes in the wind can play kind of tricky and was able to have a nice run in the middle of the round to get going.  I just remember how low the scores were here last year and how low guys shoot around this place.  It's got my attention for sure, and you've just got to keep at it.
Q. How about the delay, five hours.  How did you kill the time?
CHARLES HOWELL III: Well, we ate a few meals, and we sat around and told lies.  No, you know, when they had the delay, it didn't seem like it was going to be that bad, but man, the golf course drained unbelievable.  I mean, we're still playing the ball down, and it was okay out there, so they've done a hell of a job.
