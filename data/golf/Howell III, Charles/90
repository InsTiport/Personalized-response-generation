 Q. You had a pretty good back nine, tell us how that got started off. 
 CHARLES HOWELL III: This golf course is not easy, and you're playing so many holes knowing that par is a good score. And No. 1, my 10th hole, I holed a bunker shot for eagle which kind of got it kick-started.
 You feel like you have to take advantage of the par 5s out here because there are so many hard holes. Made a couple nice putts for birdie after that. I was fortunate to have a good back nine but par is still a good score around here. 

 Q. You had six birdies and an eagle on your round and still you had to think to yourself, just next hole, right?
 CHARLES HOWELL III: Yeah, you don't play this course thinking you're going to make a bunch of birdies, at least I don't. Maybe that's my problem. 

 Q. Most people who do play that way don't play on Saturday and Sunday. 
 CHARLES HOWELL III: You've got to take them when you get them and today, none one was reachable. 14 and 11 were reachable. It's nice when the wind blows that direction. But man, still, there's so many tough par 4s and par 3s out here that par is a heck of a score.

 Q. Tell me about the changes in the golf course between the first round and today. 
 CHARLES HOWELL III: It's a lot softer this morning. Yesterday in the afternoon it was really firm. Hit a lot of balls yesterday that bounced over the greens. All of the guys in our group did. Today was a different course. It was a lot softer. As the day went on, they started to firm up a little bit.
 I'm sure by this afternoon and the weekend, it will be really firm. If yesterday afternoon was a showing of it, it's going to get real firm.
