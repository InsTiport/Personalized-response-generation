 Q.  What was it is like watching two players you knew were going to make up your team?  
SPIDER MILLER: It's the greatest match that I've witnessed in my four years of following intently the amateur game.   
Doc, you put on a great performance.  Eagle, birdie, it was fantastic.  I just hope and expect that you did not use all your putts up.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Spider, did you get much sleep the last few days as you went through the process, following the U.S. Amateur, following these players from the semifinals knowing this mattered?  
SPIDER MILLER: Well, it's a committee decision, but the committee has always held a spot for our current U.S. Am champion, and this year it's Doc.   
Doc went out and earned that spot, and I'm very proud of him.  I'm looking forward to a great competition.  I have a wonderful team and I'm very excited.   
Thank you, President Murphy.   
 Q.  We're excited as well.  Doc, when did you find out with about the Walker Cup?  
DOC REDMAN: Two minutes.  I had no idea.  I was just trying to play my best.   
 Q.  You were so close in the Western Am; played unbelievable.  What was the difference between that week and this week?  
DOC REDMAN: I don't think there was really any difference.  I was able to pull this out and the Western I wasn't.   
I think both Doug and Norman at both events played amazing and I played awesome as well.   
No difference.
