Q. Today you're 2-down standing on the 17th tee.  You finish eagle, birdie to send in into extra holes.  We have been gushing about what a gutsy performance this has been.  How would you describe it?
DOC REDMAN: Yeah, I think it was obviously very gutsy.  It was about never giving up and believing in myself.
You never know what can happen.
Q. Now you add your name to the Havemeyer Trophy with the likes of Tiger Woods.  I can see you nodding your head.  You know Tiger woods, Jack Nicklaus.  What does this mean to you?
DOC REDMAN: It's awesome.  All the hard work has been paying off obviously.  I think it's great for everyone around me too who has been helping me out.  It's their win too.
It's surreal.
Q. How in the world do you stay so composed?
DOC REDMAN: I don't know.  I just do.  I never get too excited, never get too down.
