  Q. Can you describe your day today?   
 MARDAN MAMAT: Yeah, I start very well, four birdies in a row for a start, I think very pleased. Keeps me going and a very good start for me.  
  
  Q. Enjoyed a Top-10 finish and you come back a year later with more experience, can you take this course now?  
 MARDAN MAMAT: We got lucky. We wait for things to blow off and wind is not much, so quite lucky to have the conditions today.  
  
  Q. After almost a five-hour wait, did it affect you that much, waiting around?   
 MARDAN MAMAT: It did affect me a little bit, but I think with the start, three birdies in a row, before I start, I think that keep me wanting to play. So I'm very pleased with my putting today.
