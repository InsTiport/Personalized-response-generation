 Q. How satisfying is 6-under after two rounds? 
 MARDAN MAMAT: Yeah, due to the conditions, I think 2-under, I think I'm very happy with the score today.

 Q. Quite a performance, wasn't it, with a couple of eagles thrown in. 
 MARDAN MAMAT: Yeah, that's what keeps me going. I had a good start on the first ten holes, so some question to play them -- I think I keep myself very steady in these conditions, so I think that's the main thing.

 Q. When you say these conditions, how windy was it out there? We are standing here bathed in glorious sunshine, it's fairly warm here, but out there, it's not. 
 MARDAN MAMAT: It's not as nice as here. It's so windy. I mean, third round last year of this tournament, it's worse than this. So just keep myself calm and play one shot at a time, so that's the key. 

 Q. Some people will think you've got the lucky end of the draw because you've played in better conditions on day one, had the second day off, and now you've played in decent conditions here today. 
 MARDAN MAMAT: Yeah, I can say that, too. We are lucky, on the lucky side of the draw. I think, also, we got the wind today. Playing 36 holes yesterday with this wind, and we played 18 holes with this wind, so I think that's a fair deal and we have a long day on the first round, from morning to late evening, so I think that's a fair deal.

 Q. What did you do on that second day when you had to be back at the hotel probably?
 MARDAN MAMAT: Yeah, I mean, I just come down and have some practise, my short game, and I think short game is very important with this wind condition. So I think I need to sharpen that up before to play in this wind. 

 Q. Your position on the leaderboard is good, isn't it; you're not that far back into the final round?
 MARDAN MAMAT: Hopefully I can keep my fingers crossed and keep my form like this, I'll be very happy.
