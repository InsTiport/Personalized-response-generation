 Q.   What are your thoughts on a 4‑under par round to start here?   
MARDAN MAMAT:   I'm very pleased, very happy with the round today.   Tee‑to‑green was very good, so quite happy with 4‑under today.  
   
 Q.   Looks like a very tidy scorecard.   Was it nicely controlled out there?   
MARDAN MAMAT:   Yeah, just keep myself in play all the time, just make sure I didn't make a silly mistake, so I did that very well today.   So hopefully I will continue doing that three more days.   
   
 Q.   Well, hopefully, put it into context for us, how well have you been playing?  
MARDAN MAMAT:   Been struggling a bit.   Tee‑to‑green was very good, just need to hole a couple of putts, that's all.   But I think I feel good this week, so hopefully things coming my way this week.  
   
 Q.   Are you one of those players like most that enjoy coming back and playing Fanling?   
MARDAN MAMAT:   Oh, of course.   This is one of the oldest golf courses we play, and it's in good condition.   This is the best condition they have this week.   The setup, the greens are rolling very well, so hopefully it will be better.
