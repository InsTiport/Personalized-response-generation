  Q. That was a nice start out there today.   
 MARDAN MAMAT: Yeah, it's nice and steady.   
  
  Q. Do you like the course?  
 MARDAN MAMAT: Yeah, I played here last year, and I think the course fits my game.   
  
  Q. How does it suit your game?   
 MARDAN MAMAT: You need to be accurate off the tee, keep the ball in play all the time and just make shots on the green and you'll have opportunities.   
  
  Q. One bogey today?   
 MARDAN MAMAT: Just missed a bad drive left side in the thick rough. I had to chip it out of the fairway close to the green and I got like 55, 56 metres to the pin and went over the pin about ten feet and missed the putt.   
  
  Q. The seven birdies, how did you make those?   
 MARDAN MAMAT: It is very funny when you do a good thing, you can't remember.   
  
  Q. What was the highlight?   
 MARDAN MAMAT: The first hole is a good highlight. I hit a perfect drive to the middle of the fairway and I had like 140 metres to the pin and hit 8-iron to ten feet, eight feet. That's a nice start, settled me down.   
 Then a birdie again on No. 6, the par 5. I hit a bad drive, laid up on the right side in the semi rough and hit my tee shot about 15 feet and holed the putt, birdie.   
 7, holed a good drive, good second shot about 167 to the pin, 6-iron and hit it about six feet.   
 The eighth hole, I hit 4-iron, 180-something over the pin to about 20 feet for a birdie.   
 The par 5, 11, good drive and then 243 to the pin. Hit 3-wood on the green, 2-putt.   
 The par 3, hit 8-iron about 145, hit about four feet.   
 The last, hit okay drive, okay 3-wood and blasted out of the bunker to 12, 15 feet.   
  
  Q. Very nice start. Something to build on for the next three days?   
 MARDAN MAMAT: Yeah, I enjoyed myself today. Just keep myself calm and play one shot at a time.
