 Q.   3‑under today?  
MARDAN MAMAT:   Yeah, very pleased.   I've been hitting the ball very good, and today I holed a couple of putts.   Yeah, it was quite good.   
   
 Q.   Looking at the leaderboard, the veterans are showing the way with Miguel and Zhang; showing that there's still many years of golf left in you.   
MARDAN MAMAT:   Yeah, I'm very fortunate that we can play and compete in this level.   I'm very pleased with that.   Yeah, to have a lot of the young and old people around the leaderboard, I think that also motivates me.   
   
 Q.   Guys are also winning Majors, but why do you think you have an advantage over these guys?   
MARDAN MAMAT:   I think I've been playing so many years, I think I have a lot of experience, so I know especially how to handle the pressure when I need to.   So I think that's the key.   
   
 Q.   With four events left on the Tour, where do you hope to see yourself?   
MARDAN MAMAT:   I hope that I can get in the Top‑10.   That's my target for the last four events and to play well and get in the Top‑10.   I think I'm very happy with that.   
   
 Q.   Do you think the weather plays a part, compared to last week in Singapore, it's a little bit cooler now in Hong Kong.   
MARDAN MAMAT:   Yeah, it's so much nicer here.   I think it's quite windy today, so the course is not playing easy.   Some holes and some pins are very difficult.   So I think weather‑wise, it's so much better.  
   
 Q.   What is the key to doing well here to get a low score?  
MARDAN MAMAT:   Keep the ball in play and make sure you're on the right side of the pin.   I have a lot of good memories of playing this golf course, and especially '94, '93, playing with the amateurs; a lot of good memories here so I hope that I can stay on to the weekend.
