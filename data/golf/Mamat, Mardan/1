Q. Five birdies on the card today in rather windy conditions.   You must be quite happy with that. 
    MARDAN MAMAT:   Yeah, quite happy with that.   After the back nine the wind started blowing.   I was able to take advantage of the morning cycle.

Q.   Is this a good test of golf out there when the wind picks up especially?
    MARDAN MAMAT:   Yeah, the wind doesn't look that strong, but it's a lot of difference.   It's almost two, three‑club difference sometimes against the wind.   Like No.3 I had like 177 to the pin, and I hit 3‑iron against the wind.   It's not easy with the wind blowing.

Q.   And the birdies were from good birdie putt range or was it long putts that you made?
    MARDAN MAMAT:   Both of them in about 10 feet. 

Q.   Is this a continuation of Manila where you had a breakthrough after a long while ago?   Has the performance just carried on the last few weeks?
    MARDAN MAMAT:   Yeah, it's the same routine.   The confidence is back, so I think everything is back in place and just need to enjoy the golf more. 

Q.   How did you treat Zona after winning Manila for giving you that tip?
    MARDAN MAMAT:   Oh, he got two weeks hotel free and then a little bit of dinner.
