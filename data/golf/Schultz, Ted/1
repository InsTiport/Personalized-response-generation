Q.   A couple first impressions about your opening round here. 
TED SCHULTZ:   Very difficult.   Very windy, hard golf course anyway, and then you add a three club wind out there, it's just survival. 

Q.   Because of the weather conditions has it turned into one of those play as you go courses?
TED SCHULTZ:   Yeah, absolutely.   They had the tees up today, so it was quite a new golf course, because the wind changed.   And the practice rounds didn't do that much good, really.   So very interesting for everybody. 

Q.   After birdies on 1, 3 and 5 how were you feeling after that stretch?
TED SCHULTZ:   I felt good.   I canned those couple, but I didn't play those finishing holes very well.   I hit a couple poor drives. 
You get up on number 7, it's hard to putt in that wind.   That wind on 7 is whipping and it's real hard to steady yourself on these greens.

Q.   Lessons learned after today?
TED SCHULTZ:   Just got to fight.   Got to hang in and fight.
