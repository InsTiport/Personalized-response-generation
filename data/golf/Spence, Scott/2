 Q. Can you go through a brief description of your round for today?
 SCOTT SPENCE: Well, you know, I really don't know, quite honestly. I doubled my two day total in one day. So I fell over today. Making the cut yesterday afternoon, you know, it was a long afternoon because I played in the morning and it was very difficult emotionally, up-and-down, up-and-down, are we going to make it, are we going to miss. I was packing, getting ready to go home. And we make the cut. 
 So and then you got to change gears. I felt really good on the golf course today. I thought the routines were good. My caddie and I gelled real well. But the golf wasn't there today.

 Q. How did the course layout and conditions affect you today?
 SCOTT SPENCE: Quite challenging. So, the harder it is, normally the better I do. I'm making bogeys from middle of the fairway. And then I hit it in the rough and I'm making birdies, you know. Well not enough birdies. 
 But I'm happy to be here. It's the first cut I've made in the six Majors I've played in. So it's a different atmosphere for me mentally. So I got to figure out -- I'm just going to have fun, you know. The least I can make is 33-75, so. But if I play really well tomorrow I might make 34. So we'll see.

 Q. What are you going to try to tweak for tomorrow?
 SCOTT SPENCE: I don't know. I just got a lousy feeling going right now. And I'm going to try to go back to my bread and butter shot, which is left-to-right. I'm driving the ball absolutely perfect. Couldn't hit a green to save my kid's life, you know. 
 So we'll see how we figure it out. I'm going to continue to smile and talk to the crowd and take it all in. So I'm going to enjoy it.
