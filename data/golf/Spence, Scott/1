  Q. What do you think you struggled most with during the tournament?  
 SCOTT SPENCE: Scoring. The wind. Everything was really right there right in front of you, so I didn't have an issue with that. But we're not used to playing these events. You get a little tight and you got to get off to a good start and I did not.   
 I ended with a double, started with a double, started with a double yesterday, there's six shots there. I finished, what, 15 over for two rounds. I'm not used to playing that kind of golf.   
 So there's nothing to blame, it's just, I'm just not used to being in this arena as often as I would like.  
  
  Q. How was your experience being in Colorado, being in this competition?  
 SCOTT SPENCE: It's like old home. I used to work in Vail, Colorado for two summers. And my wife's never seen Colorado and we're going to hopefully enjoy it tomorrow and Sunday.   
  
  Q. What was the highlight of your tournament?  
 SCOTT SPENCE: Just seeing old friends and having my family here. The whole family came up from Phoenix and they were here, and also my financial advisor. He didn't do too much financial advising though.
