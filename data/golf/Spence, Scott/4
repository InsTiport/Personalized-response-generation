  Q. How do you feel after finishing at 4 over, considering how high everybody else was today?  
 SCOTT SPENCE: I haven't really looked at the scores yet. I watched it a little bit out there. But I just kept playing, plugging along, staying patient. Mike San Filippo, said thank God it's a par 70, he wouldn't have broken 80, if it wasn't.   
 But the wind swirling, the golf course is tough without any extra conditions and I feel pretty lucky to be where I'm sitting right now.  
  
  Q. Talk about any holes that were memorable out there?  
 SCOTT SPENCE: 3, I ballooned a shot, short of the right bunker, the par-3. And I shanked it in the bunker I had a great lie and the club just moved, and I hit it and then after that I 2-putted for five or for double and then on 6 or 7, the par-4, I made a bad play there. That was the only bad swing of the day, really. I dumped it in the water off the tee and made double. I 3-putted after I knocked it on. It was a good shot to get on the green, but, you know, I only had two bogeys all day and two doubles and two birdies. So I can't complain.   
  
  Q. What are you looking to do tomorrow?  
 SCOTT SPENCE: Stay with my game plan. Try to hit as many fairways as possible. My driver's going real well. And I'm pleased with that. The putting is good. We'll just keep patient and see what happens. It's taken a lot of support for me to get here. I have my boss, Steve Napoli here and I'm in heaven, so I can't complain.
