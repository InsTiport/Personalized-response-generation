Q. 5-under par 67 to start the tournament. What's the secret to that round of golf?
GUIDO MIGLIOZZI: I played solid tee-to-green and really happy about my game. It's been a good round. I started very good this tournament, 6-under par the front nine. I just missed a few shots but I'm really happy about that.
Q. This is a hard golf course, and there's lots of trouble on it, yet you took it to pieces on the front side. Is it the sort of course that you feel like you can post a low one out there?
GUIDO MIGLIOZZI: Well, I didn't thought it, but this morning was not easy, but my game was really good. Yeah, played solid tee-to-green. I hit very good irons close to the pin, so short putt for birdie. Good round. Enjoyed it.
Q. Rookie of the Year is something you're a little off the pace at the moment but a big performance here, you can push your way in. Is that something you've looked at this season?
GUIDO MIGLIOZZI: Yeah, it's something I would like to get. The competitors are really good, but let's see what this week and the next one will bring, too.
Q. Big talking point this week, 2.5 million for whoever wins it. A long way to go but if it is you, what would be the first thing you would buy with 2.5 million in the bag?
GUIDO MIGLIOZZI: Pizza.
