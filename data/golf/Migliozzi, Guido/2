Q. Talk us through what you enjoyed most about your round?
GUIDO MIGLIOZZI: Well, it's been a good round.  A bit still on the front nine, and then there has been a good turning point on 15 where I missed the shots on right par 3, and then I holed a big putt for par.
And then the 16th, terrible tee shot.  Terrible second shot.  Terrible third shot and then hole out from like ten meters for birdie and that was a good turning point for me, and then another perfect putt on 17, birdie.
But yeah, it's been very good.
Q. Well, how about on the front nine, because when you were teeing off this afternoon, you were actually nine shots off the lead.  What does that do to your mind-set when you're about to play a whole round of golf with that setback?
GUIDO MIGLIOZZI: Well, nine shots are a lot, but there's three more rounds of golf.  So just keep playing, keep playing your best golf as you can, and the results will come.
Q. It's great to see you moving up the leaderboard like this because so far this year, you've had two wins.  What would a win here in a Rolex Series Event mean to you?
GUIDO MIGLIOZZI: A lot.  Yeah, still two days of big golf, and yeah, let's keep this situation, this kind of golf.  My swing is great.  I'm feeling good on the course, and let's keep going.
