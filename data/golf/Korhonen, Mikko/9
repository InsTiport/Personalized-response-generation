Q. How was it out there for you today?
MIKKO  KORHONEN: Nerve-wracking.
Q. You held the lead a few times, does that give you confidence?
MIKKO  KORHONEN: I had more than enough confidence there but then came a little cold sweat after that.  Then I came back a little at the end.  So that was nice.
Q. What was it like playing with PÃ¡draig?
MIKKO  KORHONEN: It was good.  It was great.  I liked playing with both of them.
