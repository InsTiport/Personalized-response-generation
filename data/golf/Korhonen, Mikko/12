 Q.  Great round of 64.  Talk us through your round.  
MIKKO KORHONEN: I hit the ball pretty solid all day.  Holed a few putts.  That's pretty much it.  Didn't make much mistakes.  A couple of 3-putts, but that was it.   
 Q.  You're sitting 116th on the Order of Merit.  How much is that on your mind at the moment?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Obviously it is but I try to take it one day at a time and just go out and play my best every day.   
 Q.  How is the course playing?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: I think it's pretty easy, pretty scorable.  I think we're going to see some even lower rounds today, yeah.   
 Q.  Five birdies in a row from the 10th hole, what happened there?  Great little run?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: I know, just hit good shots, holed short putts, that's it.   
 Q.  That round's given you a lot of confidence going into the rest of the week?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, just trying to keep up what I'm doing.
