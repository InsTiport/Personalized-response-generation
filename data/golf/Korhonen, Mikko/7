Q. Quite an eventful round out there.  What are your thoughts on that?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, it was an early start.  It was a lot tougher than yesterday.  The wind was up, and yeah, it wasn't easy.
Q. Obviously you had the bogey at the 9th.  How important was it to get that birdie on the 10th to get that out of your mind?
MIKKO KORHONEN: That was pretty important, yeah.  I screwed it up on 9.  I chipped, 3-putted, and it was good to get back right away.
Q. Did that give you confidence going into that back nine having got that birdie again?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, I started feeling more confident on the back nine, definitely, yeah.
Q. And you mentioned the conditions, obviously the winds have picked up.  This is probably what you've been expecting?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yes, exactly.
Q. Great score going into the weekend.  That's something you can really build on?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, happy to be up there and hope to build on that.  Exactly, yeah.
