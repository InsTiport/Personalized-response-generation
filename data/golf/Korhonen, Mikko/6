Q. After three holes, 2-over par, but you battled back, solid rest of the round for an excellent 68 in the end?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, the start wasn't the best obviously but the first few holes are tough, so I knew there was going to be birdie chances and I stayed patient.
Q. You missed the cut last year.  What did you learn last year that you were able to take into this year on day one?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Well, just keep on your game plan.  You need to hit good shots.  Well, today, the greens were a little softer because the rain, but yeah, you still need to hit quality shots into the greens.
Q. Was there anything specific that you worked on ahead of this?  I know there's a lot of shaping of the ball here.  Did you have to work on anything particularly beforehand in practise?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Not really.  I felt good on the range for the past few days, and so just doing my thing.
Q. And in terms of the season, the Rolex Series, as well, this would be a good kick-start for you if you were to have a good week this week?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Absolutely, yeah.
