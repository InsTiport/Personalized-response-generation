Q. That's a fantastic way to finish with a chip-in on 9, your 18th.  Nice not to take the putter out of the bag?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, I think those were the first two chip-ins this year, very nice.
Q. Overall what's pleased you most about your game?  This is a very difficult golf course here at Sun City.
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, it's tough.  I'm very pleased the way I played.  I hit a lot of fairways.  Hit the middle of the greens when I had to and create a few chances and made a few birdies.
Q. The game looks to be going in the right direction.  How nice to be in good form in these Rolex Series Events at the end of the season?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, obviously it's nice, and I'm playing the World Cup after Dubai with Mikko Ilonen, so will be nice to have something left for that, as well.
Q. How much are you enjoying the overall experience here at Sun City?
MIKKO KORHONEN: It's beautiful.  Everything is so nice.
