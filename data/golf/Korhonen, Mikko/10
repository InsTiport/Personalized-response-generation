 Q.  How was it out there for you today?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Nerve-wracking.   
 Q.  You held the lead a few times, does that give you confidence?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: I had more than enough confidence there but then came a little cold sweat after that.  Then I came back a little at the end.  So that was nice.   
 Q.  What was it like playing with PÃ¡draig?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: It was good.  It was great.  I liked playing with both of them.   
 Q.  Anders, 68, how was that for you today?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Well, the first nine was good, very solid.  The last nine, I drove the ball fine but my iron shots weren't good enough.   
It's a great week.  I had a great time.  I'm happy with the time off now.
