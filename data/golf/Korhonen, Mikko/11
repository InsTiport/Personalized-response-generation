Q. Very well played, 64 on Saturday in the Portugal Masters.  How good does that one feel?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Really good.  Feels really good.
Q. For you what has been the key, not just today but all week that has put you in this wonderful position?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Maybe just try to go one shot at a time.  Not to think for the future or the past.  Just stay focused, play one shot at a time.
Q. How playable would you say the golf course was given the rain we had overnight?
MIKKO KORHONEN: It was perfect.  You didn't even notice the rain.
Q. And you could be aggressive and attack at some pins?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, absolutely.  A little more wind today which made it a little bit more difficult.
Q. How do you look at your strategy this week heading into The Race to Dubai, talking to a few players about this, the various way they deal about things, what's been your approach?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Just go one day at a time, one shot if I can, and try not to think about it.  Of course it's in the mind but not think about it too much.
Q. How have you stayed present as you just mentioned there, something golfers talk about all the time but how have you done that so far this week?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Well, so far, so good, but tomorrow to go so we'll see.
Q. Will it be the same approach for Sunday?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yes.
Q. Your second 64 of the week, how was it out there?
MIKKO KORHONEN: It was great.  Played solid.  Putted well.  Nothing special but yeah, really good round.
Q. Looking at conditions, it's a bit windier than yesterday?
MIKKO KORHONEN: A bit windier.  I thought in the beginning it's going to be a lot tougher to score low.  I stayed in the moment and tried my best and had a good score today.
Q. Looked like you'll possibly be with the final group tomorrow.  How much are you looking forward to that?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Very much.  It will be my first time, so very much, yeah.
Q. What are your thoughts about being in the final group?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Well, I hope I get a good night's sleep tonight and just try to do my thing tomorrow again.
Q. Obviously go low again, are you feeling positive enough to go low again tomorrow?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, why not.
Q. And how much are you looking forward to golf tomorrow and the competitiveness out there?
MIKKO KORHONEN: I'm looking forward, probably playing with Anders and maybe PÃ¡draig would be fun.
