 Q.  Thursday after your round of 68, you were very pleased and you had much tougher conditions in the wind today.  How pleased are you to walk off with a 70?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Really pleased.  It was tough out there.  I pulled off some really good shots and made a few long putts, and although I missed a couple of short ones, I'm still very, very happy.   
 Q.  Highlight of the round was the eagle on 4.  Tell us about that?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: That was a good 3-wood off the tee and left me with a 4-iron, which landed on the middle of the green, and then I made that, probably eight-meter putt there.   
 Q.  Two rounds of 75 last year.  You've obviously learnt from that experience.  You've come here this week and you're going into Sunday in contention at the top of the leaderboard?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, that's crazy, isn't it, how the year can make a difference.  But yeah, I've enjoyed it and I like to keep enjoying tomorrow, as well.   
 Q.  How is the atmosphere out there?  Massive crowds here today?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, it's just great, great to be here.  Perfect weather.
