 Q.  A second round 70.  What was the main difference between today and yesterday?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: We guessed the wind wrong a couple times there because it's coming from everywhere.  Not much different.  Of course playing in the last group is always a little bit more exciting.  But yeah, it's a good day.   
 Q.  A fantastic long putt on 3 but then it stalled for a little while with the three bogeys, but you got things back on track on the back nine.  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, I got it back on track.  That was a good thing, nice back nine.  I hit a couple of good shots there.  Nice to do that.   
 Q.  A couple of shots off the lead, how excited are you at the prospect of chasing down this event?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, very excited.  Just have to keep guessing the wind right and make good decisions.   
 Q.  Have to ask you about the overall situation of playing here in Sun City.  Can you enjoy what's going on around you when you're playing the tournament?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, you can enjoy.  We saw some elephants today.  It's wild.  It's nice.
