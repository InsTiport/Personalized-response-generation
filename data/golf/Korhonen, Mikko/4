Q. A 68, coming through again with another great final round, the last time it was hosted here.  You must be over the moon?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, great day.  Especially the back nine, I was able to birdie a couple holes in the end.  Had a long chance on 18 to tie the lead, but the second shot wasn't good enough.
Q. Iron play was stellar today and 15 going onwards was phenomenal with that run of birdies.  18, was it death or glory for you?
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, pretty much.  I wanted to go -- try to go for the pin, but just pulled it a lot.
Q. Just coming off a victory, just one shot behind the leader as it stands now going into the Rolex Series.  Some big months coming ahead.
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, gives a good boost.  I hope my physicality takes three in a row now after this.
