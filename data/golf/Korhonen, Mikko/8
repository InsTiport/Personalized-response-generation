 Q.  This morning when you got to the golf club, no wind, did you think it would remain as good as it was this afternoon for you?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: I thought I would probably have a chance today, because it's definitely the most calm day I've seen here.   
 Q.  A 65 for you and you have played generally the windiest part of the day.  It may be the perfect storm for you, because you might come out tomorrow, get it quiet and it kicks up in the afternoon for this morning's leaders.  
MIKKO KORHONEN: It's possible, but I have to get up at 4.00.   
 Q.  The Finns are good early risers, aren't they?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: I hope so.   
 Q.  What was good about your game today?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: I hit it solid.  Made a couple long putts.  Made all the short ones.  So basically no mistakes, no bogeys.  Didn't hit in the rough many times.  That was good.   
 Q.  And how good were the greens out there?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Greens were pure.  Very good.  Very nice.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on today's round?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: I hit it pretty solid off the tee, and irons, as well.  I didn't make too many mistakes.  Hit it in the rough a couple of times, and it's kind of, yeah, it's not easy, I'd have to say.  It's more difficult than past years I would say.   
I made a few putts.  Made a few long ones.  Didn't miss any short ones.  That's basically it.   
 Q.  And the wind was not quite as up as it normally is around here.  That must have helped a little bit today.  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, it was definitely the calmest day I've seen.  It was scorable, yeah.   
 Q.  Best round you've had around here, a 65.  How did that feel?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, it feels good.   
 Q.  Birdie, birdie on the turn.  How much did that keep momentum going?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, it kept it going, but I made a couple saves for par after that, so that was nice.   
 Q.  You started the year very well, tied tenth in South Africa.  Confidence must be quite high?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: It's all right, yeah.  But then again, last week wasn't great.  So hoping to get back this week.
