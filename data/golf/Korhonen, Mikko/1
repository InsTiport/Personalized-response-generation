 Q.  A third round 71.  Give us your assessment on today's round?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Pretty solid I think.  Hit it pretty well off the tee.  Didn't miss many greens, and when I missed, I missed the right place.  A couple of bad ones on the front nine, as well, like yesterday, but I did pretty good.   
 Q.  How much is patience a key around this golf course?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: It's the key.  If you don't have a shot to the pin, just play middle of the green and go from there.   
 Q.  Have you played a golf course like this before?  Is this something you're enjoying, plodding your way around this golf course?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Yeah, I'm enjoying it.  It demands patience, a lot of patience and I hope I have it tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're going into the final day just three off the lead.  How excited are you about the prospect tomorrow?  
MIKKO KORHONEN: Very excited.  Hope to put together another solid round and see how I end up.
