Q.   You're the last guy in, and you got to shoot with somebody who is setting some records out there.   How did that feel? 
DON REYCROFT:   It was amazing.   Michael, he was not only nice to me, he seemed to just enjoy talking with me.   It was just a nice, nice walk in the park, actually.   You know, he was very relaxed.   He relaxed me, and it was fun.

Q.   You make a nice putt on 18. 
DON REYCROFT:   I did.   That was the other thing too, is both Michael and Idoki were all very supportive to me the whole time.   Truly made the experience for me.

Q.   What did you see about what Michael did today which made that 63 possible? 
DON REYCROFT:   Well, his ball striking was on today.   You know, Mike relies a lot, I think, on his caddie, Michael, and he gives him good numbers, and Mike swings for those numbers.   He has confidence in that.
He's a darn good putter, you know, long putter too.   He knocked in about an 80‑footer, probably one of the most difficult putts I've seen in my life, for an eagle.   He just played very solid.   Very solid.

Q.   For an amateur, this experience has to be special.   How does it rank for you? 
DON REYCROFT:   It's the pinnacle.   I mean, to be 57 years old and have the opportunity‑‑ unfortunately, Russ had to pull out, but to have the opportunity to come to this venue, to play with guys that I've watched my whole life ‑‑ and I've watched a lot of golf.
You know, it's just, it's the pinnacle.   It's like, you know, Jack Nicholson would say, it's off my bucket list now, you know.   Just fabulous.

Q.   Thank you so much.   Sorry you didn't make the cut, but it was a good score. 
DON REYCROFT:   It was fabulous.   Thank you.
