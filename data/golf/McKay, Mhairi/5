  Q.  Is there something today that all of a sudden, you're on a better level?   
 MHAIRI McKAY:  I feel like I've been hitting it pretty well the last few weeks.  It's been slightly frustrating.  My putting's been lousy.  I got some advice from Gary Gilchrist and that just seemed to do the trick for me and my putting has been a thousand percent better over the last two days.   
 So if you feel that you're going to make the birdie opportunities when you're on the green, that gives you a lot more confidence rather than you feel you have to hit it to inches all the time.   
 I think that's been a big difference the last two days.   
  
  Q.  How did the course play this morning in comparison to yesterday afternoon?   
 MHAIRI McKAY:  I thought it was pretty similar to be honest.  I'm glad the round is over, because I think it's going to get hotter and hotter.   
    
  Q.  Now the last putt, the last couple of putts there, you left kind of a tester for your final putt; were you glad to just go up and finish it off?   
 MHAIRI McKAY:  Well, I think it was just uphill into the green.  I may be came out of the putt slightly but I was glad the last putt went middle of the hole.  All in all I played well and putted well, so hope I can keep going on the weekend.   
  
  Q.  You've got to be on a high; right?   
 MHAIRI McKAY:  It's just nice to be playing on the weekend because I have been playing way felt was pretty well the last few weeks and kind of just missed the cuts.  And last week was slightly disappointing.  I had a pretty good first round and kind of had a miserable second day.  I just want to enjoy the weekend.   
 I'm getting married in November but fortunately my mother has been an angel and she has been doing most of the organizing and that's something exciting to look forward to.
