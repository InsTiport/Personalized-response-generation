Q.  You all managed to look reasonably calm out there.  But tell me what's going on underneath?

MHAIRI MCKAY:  Well, in the back of my mind I'm always wondering what's going on and who's going to get blue's points up on the board.  I really just tried to focus on every shot I had and try and hit the best shot I possibly could on that hole.  I think we all did that, and it worked out.


Q.  What about this whole experience?  Is it something that you can enjoy, or is it something that you just sort of get through and hope you can enjoy it afterwards?

MHAIRI MCKAY:  You definitely enjoy it.  The crowds here in Sweden were absolutely fantastic.  Standing on the first tee and just hearing the European chants and chanting your name, you've got to love that.  And that's the reason we play golf.  Days like today don't come along too often.  So we're all going to enjoy it for sure.


Q.  We've seen the Europeans going in the swimming pool behind us, when you've won the Solheim Cup it's easy to be cheerful about it.  A lot of people have been struck by the team spirit this week.  What's the key to that?

MHAIRI MCKAY:  I think we all know each other really well.  Just having a particularly good time.  If we don't know anybody particularly well, we get acquainted.  Everything has been fantastic.  Just the players, helpers everything that's been.


Q.  Just turn around a little because you've got to go to the closing ceremony.  Champions, 1992, 2000 and 2003.  Done by Annika Sorenstam, and now they can wear the T-shirts with pride.
