MHAIRI MCKAY:  Birdied the second.  Hit 3-iron on to about 20 feet.  Two-putt.  Birdied the 4th, hit behind a tree off my drive, and then I kind of punched and 9-iron to about 12 feet; made the putt.  Birdied 7, hit 7-iron on to the green to about four to five feet, made it up the slope.  Bogeyed 11, pulled my tee shot.  My iron left.  Didn't get up-and-down.  Birdied 12.  Hit 3-wood onto about 6 feet and pulled the putt left.  Missed an eagle putt.  I double bogeyed 17.  I hit out of bounds on the right and proceeded to get up-and-down at the bunker.  And chipped in from the side of the green on 18 for birdie.

Q.  On 17  -- (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  It went right. 

Q.  Identify the ball?

MHAIRI MCKAY:  No, there was a ball over the fence, but couldn't see any identification marks.  Nobody  --.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  I played a provisional, and they didn't find the ball, so then the provisional becomes the ball in play.   

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  No, I don't think so, I think I gave myself plenty of opportunities.  I had a lot of really good putts that actually didn't go in.  The pins were in some tricky positions today.  And then just  -- like you say, one bad swing on 17.  But I felt pretty good about myself out there.  I think I pushed Carin the whole way.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  I'm sure tomorrow I will. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  She was very steady.  I think, in general, the spirit of the group was really good and positive.  It was really fun to be in the group.  But she was just really steady.  Made a whole bunch of good putts and didn't do too much wrong on the fairway or on the green.  She played very well. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  Sure, it gave me confidence.  Kind of, I think, (inaudible) the lead with someone at that point.  I felt good.  It was a really good stroke and it was nice to see it go in the hole.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  I slept well.  Not too bad actually.  I was more worried about getting my stuff packed than sleeping.  I guess I woke up kind of early just lying there.  But that's fine.

Q.  You still seem very happy to watch that last birdie fall.

MHAIRI MCKAY:  Wouldn't you be?  I don't think it was really a rough round at all.  I played great golf.  I was very happy with my ball striking and, sure, a couple other putts could have gone my way, but other than one swing, I think everything  -- I don't think it was a bad round.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  I thought I had a great chance because I felt like I was playing very well too.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  Definitely, I think I had been knocking them close  -- three, all the holes up to that point. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  No, I don't think  -- if I had lost by one, I definitely wouldn't be happy right now.  But to do it in that fashion is kind of  -- it's annoying, but... That's the way it happens.  I think to lose, to lose is the thing that's most disappointing.  Doesn't matter what fashion. 

Q.  What memories are you going to take home from this week?  First time up through the leaderboard through Sunday, and have done really, a pretty much good all around week until Sunday.  Other than that, what are your memories going to be coming out of it?

MHAIRI MCKAY:  Just that made a lot of birdies.  I played really good golf even when the pressure was on.  Feel like my swing is getting there.  I think my whole game is coming together and hopefully, there will be another chance for me to get up on the leaderboard.

Q.  No. 9, is the hole, a lot of eagles and birdies, when you two-putt or two- or three-putt for par, do you feel that was maybe a missed opportunity?  Is that one that got away from you?

MHAIRI MCKAY:  Par is still a good number.  It didn't hurt me.  Carin made eagles.  You can't really  -- I'm not in control of what she does.  I'd hit some good shots.  It was just a really awkward first putt.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  I think they were nervous wrecks.  I think I heard them up pacing the floors last night.  I'm downstairs and they're up.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  There is a McKay tartan scarf in the room, there's a Scottish Clans and Their Tartans book.  There's a McKay (Inaudible) next to my bed.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  All four years.  Very supportive and really fun people. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

MHAIRI MCKAY:  Not at all.  I think we were all playing well.  I think we fed off of each other, to be honest.  So I think it was only a positive thing.
