Q. Can we get some comments about your round today?
SUNGJAE IM: I hit 3-under today, but overall, I was hitting the ball really well. I was finding the fairway from the teebox more than yesterday, so it made my second shots a lot easier. Due to that, I had more looks at birdies. I was a little disappointed that I couldnt convert with my mid-range putts, but Im still happy with how it went out there today.
Q. Can you tell us what happened on the last hole?
SUNGJAE IM: I hit my tee shot into the bunker. I hit my approach from 166 meters with my 7-iron and that went into another greenside bunker. I noticed I had a good lie from there and my bunker shots have been great all last week leading into this event, so I felt confident. I landed the ball right where I wanted to and ended on a good note.
Q. Howd you make that bogey?
SUNGJAE IM: I had a long putt on that par-3. My lag putt was a little short and had about two meters left. I think it was a little over three feet. It didnt break as much as a I thought it would, so it unfortunately led to a bogey.
Q. You played with Rickie for the first time on TOUR. How was that?
SUNGJAE IM: Yeah, it was the first time on the PGA TOUR that I played with Rickie. When I was younger, I saw him win the Korea Open. I think I was in middle school or in sixth grade. I was in the gallery and saw him play as a fan. Its cool to think that Im playing in the same group as him on the PGA TOUR now. Hes always been a player that Ive admired, and I learned a lot from playing with him. Hes a great shotmaker and always has the best manners. It was a fun experience.
Q. Any conversation with Rickie that stood out?
SUNGJAE IM: I hit a hybrid on a par-3 and it went straight for the pin. He praised me after the shot, and it was really cool.
Q. Youre in good position after the first two rounds. Whats your mindset entering Saturday?
SUNGJAE IM: This is a really difficult course, so there are holes that you need to play conservative. I want to put a lot of thought into my shots, but also know when to be aggressive when theres an opportunity. There is definitely a lot of strategy involved. I hope to play well this weekend.
Q. What are you going to practice on this afternoon?
SUNGJAE IM: Just my putting. My shots felt pretty good today, so I want to finish the day off with more putting.
Q. What are your thoughts on THE PLAYERS coming up next week?
SUNGJAE IM: I made my first ace on the PGA TOUR at that event last year, but I unfortunately missed the cut. I hope to make the cut this year. Just take it one round at a time and be in contention.
