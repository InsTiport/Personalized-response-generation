Q. Can you describe your round?
SUNGJAE IM:   I was happy with my shots today. I hit a lot of fairways, so it made my approach shots a lot easier. That gave me a lot of good looks at birdie, which helped me go low. Im very happy with how it went out there.
Q. What was the confidence like heading into this week?
SUNGJAE IM:   I honestly wasnt feeling very confident the last few weeks. I feel like its all coming back to me now. Im having a lot of good momentum and I hope to keep it going for the next two days.
Q. What is the difference from yesterday to today?
SUNGJAE IM:   Honestly, my shots felt the same. Yesterday, I didnt hit as many fairways as I did today, so it made things a little more difficult. My tee shots were more consistent today, so my round felt more stable and I was more at ease.
Q. You obviously played well before the break and struggled a bit since the Return to Golf. What has changed?
SUNGJAE IM:   I havent been swinging the ball like Ive been wanting to the last few weeks. Starting last week though, my swing started to feel a lot better and I was hitting the ball similar to how I was hitting it before the quarantine. That allowed me to play with more freedom and consistency.
Q. Have you thought about the possibility of winning $15 million?
SUNGJAE IM:   Im aware of the $15 million on the line, but I try not to think about it when I play. I know if I play my best the next two days, the opportunity will come. It all seems like a dream. Just thinking about it now makes me pretty happy.
Q. What would you do with the $15 million?
SUNGJAE IM:   I would buy a house in the United States and save so that I can live a comfortable life in the future.
Q. Would you play less if you had $15 million or keep playing more?
SUNGJAE IM:   Keep playing more.
