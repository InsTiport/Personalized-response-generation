  Q. (The following are answers to questions in Korean.)
 SUNGJAE IM:   I felt pretty good with the shots on the driving range, so I think that helped me to feel comfortable and I was able to make the birdies in a row.
 I've been playing okay, but I would make silly mistakes, so I really had to grip down and find a hungry mind to play better, so I really focused on making more birdies, and I think that really helped me today.
 I didn't get to watch K.J. win live but I did watch it on the reruns.
 I did not get to watch Si-woo Kim live but I heard that he won over the news.
 When K.J. won I was pretty young, so I did not think too much about it.  It was just only my dream to end up on the PGA TOUR, and now I'm here.  It's amazing.
 The first two rounds the wind wasn't that strong, so I'm curious to find out how windy it'll get on the third and the fourth round, so I'll have to be very smart with course management, and I think that'll help my game.
