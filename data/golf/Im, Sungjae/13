Q. Just talk about the experience of playing in your first Presidents Cup?
SUNGJAE IM: To be able to play as a 21-year-old after a rookie season is pretty amazing. I'm so honored to see my name with the other great legends of golf playing on this team, so I'm very, very excited.
Q. Do you feel this is a culmination of all your hard work this past year? Do you feel like it's that prize at the end of the year?
SUNGJAE IM: I think it's a combination of a lot of things. I had a lot of Top-5s and Top 10s and then though I didn't convert a win in the 2019-2020 season, I still think I had an amazing season, winning Rookie of the Year, going into THE TOUR Championship as a rookie, so I'm very happy with my season and where I am.
Q. How has it been being in the team room?
SUNGJAE IM: It's a really relaxed environment within the 12 guys on the team. I feel like we all have great chemistry and I just want to be able to help out the guys when I'm out there.
Q. Did you watch the Presidents Cup going up?
SUNGJAE IM: I watched the 2015 Presidents Cup and the 2017 Presidents Cup.
Q. And what were your impressions of the competition seeing -- it feels like it's been pretty one-sided with the Americans winning. Have you discussed that as a team?
SUNGJAE IM: I know the International Team only won once and it was here at this course, so I think there is a good chance for us to perform well, but I know it's going to be a tough course for both teams, so hopefully we'll just go out there and win it.
Q. Have you been bothered by the flies this week?
SUNGJAE IM: There's been so many flies, so it's been bothering me a little bit when I've been hitting shots, but I've been using a lot of bug spray, so hopefully that helps me out during tournament days.
