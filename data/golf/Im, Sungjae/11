Q. How was it out there today?
SUNGJAE IM: I feel like both Cameron and I were hitting the ball really well, and he was putting great, too. He made some amazing putts on the first few holes, but it's a bit unfortunate to end the way we did, but we're looking forward to tomorrow.
The last few holes, we had a couple putts to win it, and captain Ernie and Cameron told me to look a little bit more but I went with my gut and it unfortunately didn't go in. But we're happy with our results.
Looks I will be playing tomorrow and hopefully I can get at least half a point for the team tomorrow. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow's matches.
