 Q.  How does it feel to score the first match won for the Internationals?  
SUNGJAE IM: The International Team was off to a good start, but I kept looking at the leaderboard throughout my round and saw that we were down, so I really tried my best to score a point for the Internationals, and I'm happy to have done that and I really wanted to beat Gary. It was a good match today.   
I was hitting the ball so well today, especially when I was warming up on the range, I felt like my ball-striking was so well and I knew that if I putted well, the match would end well. So I'm incredibly happy with the way things turned out.   
 Q.  Looks like the International Team needs a lot of help today. What will you be doing moving forward?  
SUNGJAE IM: I think the last few matches are the most important. I think even with the matches that are down, if we at least get half a point, I think we have a chance. So I want all my teammates to fight till the end and see what happens.
