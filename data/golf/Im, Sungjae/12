Q. What was your first Presidents Cup experience like and how nervous were you?
SUNGJAE IM: Surprisingly I wasn't too nervous. I was going to hit a 3-iron off the tee but Ernie came up and advised me to hit a driver since the pin was to the left and obviously it worked out really well. So I'm really happy about my results today and I'm excited for tomorrow.
I feel like our team work was great. When I wasn't playing well, Adam would cover for me and vice versa. I think our teamwork really helped make our match great.
Q. Talk about that chip.
SUNGJAE IM: It was a left-to-right, heavy sloping chip but I hit it right where I wanted to. Spun exactly how I wanted it and it ended up going in.
It's going to be foursomes tomorrow, and instead of playing aggressive, I think the smartest way is to play conservative, and I'm excited for tomorrow.
