  Q. First off, your impressions of the round today and the difficult conditions?
 SUNGJAE IM:   Yeah, it's win did he conditions, same as last year, and but I played pretty well.  Other than 17, 17 I made some little mistake, so I feel like I can finish with under par.
 Q. How disappointed were you when you got to the bunker on 17 and saw the way the ball was laying in there?
 SUNGJAE IM:   Yeah, it's like the ball buried in the bunker, so if I hit it to the pin like a hundred percent the ball goes to the water, so I made the shot that would get the ball on the green and tried to just finished up with a bogey, but unfortunately I made a double bogey.
 Q. Very steady rounds so far.  What will you need to do tomorrow to take it deep tomorrow and win the tournament?
 SUNGJAE IM:   So I like windy conditions, everybody has got the same in like the tough conditions.
