 Q.  It was quite windy during the start of your round.  What was it like at the end?  
RIKARD KARLBERG: It felt like it came down a bit the last four or five holes there.  So we'll see what the cut is, could be minus two.  We'll see what happens with Sergio coming in.  But the last stretch, 10 to 16 is very tough.   
Tried to do something good at the holes that were downwind, and some you're very happy with yourself and the way I played it.   
 Q.  What's the game plan for the weekend?  Will you keep it the same as you have been doing all week?  
RIKARD KARLBERG: Yeah, same.  I'm just going to keep my head down and try to play, as I want to win this, and we'll see where we end up.
