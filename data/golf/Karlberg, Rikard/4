RIKARD KARLBERG: I worked quite hard the last two weeks to try to get in shape.  It's been a little up-and-down this season.  Haven't really gone out there and working the way that I'm going to win the tournament.  This week, I think my mind-set is right, even if I don't do that.  It's so competitive out here, so you have to have that mind-set.   
 Q.  Four birdies on the front nine and a great comeback off the bogey on 16 with birdies on 17 and 18.  Tell us about those.  
RIKARD KARLBERG: I just told my caddie, because I was a little disappointed after the great tee shot on 16.  I pulled it and hit it too far.  I said, finish with birdie, birdie now.   
Holed a long one, a 30-footer on 17, and then I hit a great tee shot that actually went over the whole fairway on the last.  I had to hit a pitch just forward.  Hit a good lob-wedge, as well.  Just hit it to five feet and able to hole that.  It felt really great, yeah.   
 Q.  10 to 16, are they quite difficult?  
RIKARD KARLBERG: Yeah, I think the pin positions there is quite tricky.  Especially you have an easy par 3, 12, and still, it's like hard to get close to that pin because it's just on the edge of the green and then it just slopes and everything.   
14, 15, it's not easy holes.  You have to hit really good tee shots there.  Surprised to see 16th is like the Sunday pin already today.  So I think that's the reason why you don't see that many birdies.
