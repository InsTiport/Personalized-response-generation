 Q.  Rikard, 6-under 64, how is that for you today?  
RIKARD KARLBERG: Fantastic.  I have a super cold.  My eye had inflammation this morning.  So I was happy to get around pretty good.  I never putted this good in I don't know how long, so I'm very happy.   
 Q.  Does that mean you weren't concentrating fully on the golf?  Maybe relaxed a bit more?  
RIKARD KARLBERG: Yeah, somehow mentally, I knew what I had to do.  That really made it quite simple and comfortable.   
 Q.  What's the longest putt you had today and how was the putting?  
RIKARD KARLBERG: It was fantastic.  I think I had eight putts on my back nine or something like that.  You know, which was the longest; it was probably around 30, 40 feet.  But yeah, I'm really, really happy how I played today, even if I didn't have all that many -- wouldn't hole that many putts, it would still be a good round.   
 Q.  Scoring was lower in the afternoon.  How was it for you?  
RIKARD KARLBERG: We didn't have any real wind, and I hit it good off the tee.  I felt like it sets up a lot of good chances.
