  Q. Nice finish today.  Nice week for you.  Just comment on the week.
 ABRAHAM ANCER:   Yeah, it was a solid week.  Nice to finish with two birdies there on the last two holes after not being able to make birdies on the, in quotation, easy holes.
 But, yeah, it was a very solid week.  I felt really good over ball, on the greens and off the tee.  I think my mid to longer irons could get a lot, lot better.
 I got to get with it, and I actually scored really well with what I brought.
 Q. It's been sort of hit or miss at this tournament for you.  A few missed cuts, but now two Top 5 finishes.  What is it about this course that suits you on those years where you got it going?
 ABRAHAM ANCER:   Yeah, I liked it.  Even the years I missed the cut was just weird stuff.  Felt like I played pretty good.  I mean, it's a fine line from missing the cut by one and you can win out here.
 But, yeah, I just like the layout.  I think it's a course that suits my game.
