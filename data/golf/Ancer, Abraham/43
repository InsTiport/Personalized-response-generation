ABRAHAM ANCER: Very frustrated, couldn't really get anything going.  I was always battling back, making bogeys on par-5s, when I should have been making birdies.  It put me behind the eight ball.  Hit the ball pretty good for the most part, just couldn't get the putts to go in.  Missed a couple of short ones, maybe three of them that I shouldn't have missed.  Other than that I keep learning and moving forward.
Q. Is it speed or line, what was happening with the short ones?
ABRAHAM ANCER: I don't know.  A little bit of everything.  I just didn't feel that comfortable out there on the greens for some reason.  I didn't really feel like nerves, it was just something was off.  Learned from it, like I said, and keep going forward.  I get to play next week, so I've got to erase completely this week and start over.
Q. Consolation prize that you're advancing to the BMW, your season still lives on?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, it's nice.  Coming into this week knowing I'd move forward, obviously I'd be excited.  But obviously a little bitter, especially finishing like this.  Shouldn't have ever happened.  But it's part of it.  You've got to learn from it.
Q. You're obviously going to take some positives from this week?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, a lot of positives, like I said.  I'm hitting the ball good.  I putted really, really good for two of the days, just -- maybe three, actually.  And I've just got to keep doing the same thing, just keep knocking.
Q. What did you see out there today with Bryson?
ABRAHAM ANCER: He was solid.  He did what he had to do, executed his game plan and it worked out.  He played solid.
