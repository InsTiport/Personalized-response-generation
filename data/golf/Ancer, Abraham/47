Q. Some comments on your round today.  7-under, 65.  Your first trip here?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, first trip here.  Actually have great memories of this place.  My freshman year of college I got the Jack Nicklaus Award and I got to come here as a freshman, Sunday, get that award from Jack.  That was incredible and I just I can't imagine, it was like Deja Vu walking the fairways, watching from outside and now playing.  It's a dream come true obviously.  And today I felt great.  I hit the ball really good off the tee, hit my irons well, and I putted well and I scrambled really good.  So when you do that it's usually a pretty good round.
Q. This is your first year playing here, right?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, first time playing in the Memorial.
Q. So what's it like, the experience coming in playing on Jack's course?
ABRAHAM ANCER: It's awesome.  There's 18 beautiful, beautiful holes out here and they're really good holes.  Obviously you got good landing areas, but if you don't hit the fairway you're in trouble, I mean it's pretty penal out there.  And I managed to do that well today which it was awesome.
Q. Keys to your round?  You mentioned the putter was working really well for you today.  You holed a lot of putts?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, I struggled with it a little bit the Sunday last week.  And then the first three holes it kind of missed some birdie looks and a par putt.  After that I found something and I started putting really, really well and I just rolled it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ABRAHAM ANCER: It's always a little something.  Either a little bit of forward in your stance or my, kind of widening my stance a little bit more.  And I actually did both of those things and I started just rolling it.
Q. Did you know that putt on 17 was going in, or did you maybe mishit it?
ABRAHAM ANCER: No, I didn't.  I knew it was in, just because Beau hit it just before me.  He hit a perfect putt and I saw the ball roll right where his.  His rolled with the same speed and I knew it was going to be in.
Q. How important was continuing and advancing your round out of the bunker on that back side?
ABRAHAM ANCER: There was some key moments there, obviously, playing some good golf and hitting some good shots.  But sometimes if you don't have the right club, if you're in between clubs, I mean it gets dicey, because it's, you got some small landing areas there that you're going to play a little bit safe.  And I went in the bunker there a couple times, managing to do, to get those up-and-downs, that was huge.
Q. Curious about your interest in Formula 1 and are you a thrill seeker, would you say?  Jumping out of airplanes?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Not really, no.  I love cars so anything that deals with cars, I truly enjoy.  I don't like heights, so I wouldn't jump out of a plane.  But driving fast, I really love.
Q. (No Microphone.)
ABRAHAM ANCER: I grew up go-carting every now and then and I just, I mean I don't do it enough, but I just, I like it a lot.  I like going fast and taking a turn at a quick speed, that feels great.
Q. A little different than golf?
ABRAHAM ANCER: A little different, for sure.
Q. Is that your alter ego or what?
ABRAHAM ANCER: I don't know, but just like if you're -- you can always, obviously, get better.  It's like racing, you screw a little turn and you know you kind of slid a little bit, you lost some time and it's tough to make it up.  It's kind of like golf, you hate doing it, but when you make a good turn you know you kind of gained maybe not a half second, but it adds up.  And so in golf you make a bogey, you're obviously trying to fight back, but sometimes you push too hard you might spin out.  And golf is the same, you if you push too hard you might put yourself in bad spots.
Q. Do you have a fast car?
ABRAHAM ANCER: It's a SUV.  It's a little faster SUV, but nothing crazy.  Maybe in the future.
Q. How were the scoring conditions?
ABRAHAM ANCER: It was great.  Soft.  If you, you can go at the pins, I mean right at it and it will stop right away.  But also if you get a little greedy out here, the up-and-downs are not easy.  So if you put the ball in play, you can hit some really aggressive shots and get a lot of looks.
Q. Did you expect to be in this position coming off of your first ever round on this course?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Well, I've been playing really solid really all year.  It's been maybe nine holes out of the whole four rounds that kind of kept me from being really, really up there.  But I feel really comfortable with my game right now.  And I'm not surprised, that's, I want to take it one day at a time and one hole at a time and just keep doing what I'm doing.
