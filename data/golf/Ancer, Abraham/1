  Q. You came back in April, it's kind of the real Masters.  Do you feel a difference?  Do you feel like --
 ABRAHAM ANCER:   Well, first of all, we have people now, which is nice.  It's really cool to see some people out here and cheering us on.  The golf course is obviously different.  It's way, way firmer.  The greens right now, being a Monday, are very fast and very, very firm, which is going to be a really good challenge.  It's nice to see the course like this.  I'm sure the Augusta National crew didn't like the low scores, so it shows right away where it's going to be this week, which is going to be fun.
