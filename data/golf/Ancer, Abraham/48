 Q.  Talk about the round today and how encouraging your play is?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: I played good.  A little bit up and down.  Really made a bunch of birdies on the front nine.  I swung it really well.  And then one loose shot on the back nine cost me a double.  And other than that I hit the ball really good.  I didn't make any birdie putts coming in.  I made some nice par putts.  But a little bit tough finishing with a bogey, especially on a par 5.  But ended up in a tough spot and couldn't make up and down.  But all in all it's a good solid two days.  And I'm just trying to do the same thing coming up tomorrow and on Sunday.   
 Q.  How important is it to play well this week?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, it's huge.  If I don't play well, I'm not playing any golf next week.  I'm not trying to put any extra pressure, I know what I need to do.  And I just need to execute my game plan and it will be fine.   
 Q.  How similar was it to yesterday's conditions?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: I thought very similar, maybe yesterday a little bit windier.  But all in all pretty similar.
