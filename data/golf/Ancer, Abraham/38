Q. Describe a little bit your round today.  There was a lot of up and downs.
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, it was a really crazy round.  I mean, it had a little bit of everything, a lot of birdies, an eagle, two double bogeys, and a bogey.  So like I said, I hit the ball really well.  Par-3s cost me a lot today.  That's where I made my bogeys and my double bogeys.
But other than that, I'm happy with my round, happy with the way I fought out there.  And just looking forward to the weekend.
Q. So first time that a Mexican makes the cut at a U.S. Open in 20 years, first time two Mexicans made the cut at the U.S. Open.  And what does that mean for Mexico and Mexican golf?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, just speaks how good we're playing.  I think we have a lot more players that could be out here.  Just a matter of getting us here.  But I think we're doing a good job.  I know Carlos is playing really well, and really hope to have us have a really big weekend.
