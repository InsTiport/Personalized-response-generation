  Q. 2-0, obviously playing very well.  Assess your win today, please.
 ABRAHAM ANCER:   Yeah, it was a very solid golf today.  With the exception of the 1st hole I felt like I hit the ball really well off the tee, maybe a little bit better yesterday off the tee but didn't put myself in too many bad spots.  Hit a lot of good shots and rolled it way better than yesterday.  I made the putts that I needed to at the right times and happy with how I ended up.
 Q. How important is it not putting yourself in bad spots to keep that pressure, especially when you get up in a match, to keep that pressure on your opponent?
 ABRAHAM ANCER:   Very important.  Once you get up in a match and you keep hitting good shots off the tee, everything kind of -- you feel a little bit more relaxed, and this golf course is all about being in the fairway.  If you're in the fairway you can attack and you can make a lot of birdies.  But still, you can't be overly aggressive.  I guess you can a little bit with these greens being softer, but it's a golf course that it's a lot of fun when you're in the fairway, for sure.
 Q. Have you become more comfortable in these big events, these worldwide events?  Playing well here do you feel a little bit more comfortable?
 ABRAHAM ANCER:   Absolutely.  Yeah, I feel a lot more comfortable.  I'm not worried about what other guys are playing or how they're playing, I just come here and do my thing and figure that my game is good enough to compete out here.  So, yeah, I feel great in events like this and they're a lot of fun too.
 Q. Was that maybe a little different a couple years ago?  Did you not feel maybe as comfortable with where you stood in these events?
 ABRAHAM ANCER:   Maybe.  It took me a little bit of time to realize or believe that I had what it takes to contend out here and but now I mean I feel great, I walk into any event and I feel like I belong and got out there with confidence and just play my game.
 Q. Obviously everything's in your hands tomorrow; what's your mindset as you go out there to play your final match?
 ABRAHAM ANCER:   Same thing.  I'm playing Viktor, who's been playing really solid golf for a long time now, for a couple of years and I don't know how he did today or not, but I know he's a tough competitor.  Doesn't matter who I'm playing, I have to be playing really good so the mindset is the same.
