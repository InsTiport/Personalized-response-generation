 Q.  Abe, just talk about your ace a little bit, walk us through the club and everything there on 16.  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Well, I believe I had 156, and the ball wasn't really going that far, so I went with a little 8-iron. I tried to hit it as high as I can and just bring it in soft because the pin was a little tucked short, and it came out right at it. It never left the flag. It landed probably two yards short of it and rolled in. It was very anti-climactic because there was nobody out there and we couldn't high-five or anything, but still, it was awesome to have my first PGA TOUR ace.   
 Q.  Is it weird making an ace with no fans? Like you said, there's no screaming, no cheering?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Definitely. Definitely a little different, and your reaction, you definitely want to go high-five or something and we can't right now, so it was definitely different, but I mean, I'll take it.   
 Q.  How would you assess your round in total out there?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Probably very boring. Really nothing crazy except for the hole-in-one. That was obviously exciting. But other than that, just a bunch of pars, couldn't really get much going. But I feel good, so hopefully we get hot on the weekend.
