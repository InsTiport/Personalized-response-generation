 Q.  You must be pleased with today's work?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, very pleased with the way I played.  Like I said, extremely tough conditions out there.  The golf course firmed up a ton.  It was definitely a different animal than the last two days.  Excited for tomorrow and happy the way I played today.   
 Q.  What was the key today?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Just have to strike the ball pure out there.  If not, you will be missing a lot of greens and up-and-downs here are definitely not easy.  Like I said, happy the way I struck the ball today.  I rolled it, I think pretty good for the most part.  I definitely can improve on that point.   
 Q.  We've talked about this before, but what did you learn specifically in Australia about winning tournaments?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: I think what I learned the most was exactly a year ago in the Playoffs, I was tied for the lead I think at the Dell Championship in Boston.  I didn't play bad.  I just didn't make the key putts that I needed to make in certain parts of the round.  But yeah, just the way I felt there, I think that situation is going to help me a ton and that showed in Australia.  I was really calm on Sunday.   
Granted, I had a five-shot lead going into the round, but still, you have to defend it.  The conditions were really tough.  I think those two situations were definitely going to help for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Probably get that wind again tomorrow.  Just knowing you can keep it under the gun in those conditions should help, too?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: I mean, I like playing in the wind.  I feel really comfortable bringing the trajectory down, and I'm not scared to play in 30-, 40-mile-an-hour winds.  As long as everybody is playing the same stuff, I'm up for it.  I like the challenge and I like hitting shots.  The short game is definitely key when the conditions are tough.   
 Q.  I know you're trying to decompartmentalize, but you can tick off a lot of boxes tomorrow:  A win, FedExCup positioning, Presidents Cup, etc.  How are you keeping that on the back burner?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: The only thing I have to worry about is still play some good golf tomorrow and that will take care of itself.  I'm trying not to think about that that much.  I know it's there and I obviously think about it, but I'm just focusing on trying to do everything I can to just play a good, solid round tomorrow.
