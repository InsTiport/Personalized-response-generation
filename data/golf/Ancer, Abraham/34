was here a couple years ago, had a great experience and glad to be back.   
 Q.  67. Tell us about the day.  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, very solid day. Started my round really good with four birdies, and then made a couple bogeys there in the middle of the round. Put myself in a terrible spot off the tee and pretty much plugged in the lip of the bunker where I just can't do anything about it, and obviously walked out with a couple bogeys. But stayed really patient and it paid off at the end. I managed to finish with three birdies.   
 Q.  When you go through a mid-round blip with those couple of bogeys, what doubt yourself?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Well, it's frustrating, and I feel like the start of my season has been really frustrating. I've been close to playing good golf but I obviously haven't been to where I wanted to be.   
I just thought for this tournament, I was going to be really patient and just have a really good attitude, something that really these first tournaments of the season, I didn't do very well which makes me mad because I'm usually very good about that.   
I thought about that, staying patient and stay in the moment and the only shot that counts is the one you have in front of you, so I just tried to do that.   
 Q.  Your third week in a row playing on the Asian Swing, how do you keep yourself motivated, keep pushing yourself to do what you want to achieve out there?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Ultimately this is what I love doing. We're very lucky to travel the world and play for a living. So if you see it that way, it's pretty easy to stay motivated and stay hungry, and try to do good out here. These are big events. I mean, it doesn't take much to really motivate me and put myself in this kind of golf course in these big events. I'm going to be motivated.   
 Q.  Four shots back, is it a big lead to narrow down tomorrow?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: You never know. Hopefully it gets really windy tomorrow and gets super tricky and a lot more people will have a chance. If it stays like this, I haven't look -- I think at one point I saw Rory and Louis, but yeah, they are really good players and they are going to shoot low tomorrow. I have to make a lot of birdies. You've got to have a hot start, keep the pedal to the metal and see what happens.
