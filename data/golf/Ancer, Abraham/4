Q. How do you feel about this long round? 
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, obviously, a different round having to stop and coming back on Amen Corner is never easy my first time, obviously, but I managed to play really well. Got lucky on definitely one shot on 13 and took advantage and made birdie there. Then after that, just played really solid. 
Really happy with my first round out here at the Masters and looking forward to the next three days.

Q. So starting on 12, people talk about that being one of the hardest shots in golf. Talk about the nerves this morning, not really coming through from the round and getting thrown into the mix right there. 
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, I obviously took the yardage from yesterday before we left the tee box and knew how far I had the shot. So I hit a couple shots before I left on the range and just kind of pictured it in my head and made sure I had a good feeling before I left the range. 
I was going to play a little conservative left just because it was in between clubs, and I couldn't go long. So I went with the shorter one and just aimed left and actually pulled it a little bit, but it was fine. It was on the green. I hit a 9 iron. Yeah, I just twoâputted. I just wanted to do something solid there and don't do any mistakes coming in. 
Yeah, it ended up working out great.
