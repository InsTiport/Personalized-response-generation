Q. Just some thoughts on your round today.  64, 6-under.  I think that's the lowest score you've had here.
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, felt really well out there all day.  First nine holes it was a little tough with the weather we got there.  Some pretty good showers couple times, maybe three times.  Just had to stay patient.
After that I kept hitting the ball well and saw some putts go in, which was nice.
Q. You've had some decent success at this course.  Shot a couple low scores.  You're becoming more familiar with it.  What do you like about it so much?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, I think you use every club in the bag out here.  It's not a super long golf course, but it's pretty penal if you don't hit the right shots.
It's playing a little bit different.  I haven't played it this soft.  It's playing a little bit longer.  It's a great test.  I think it's a great golf course.  Showcases if you're playing well.
Q. Was there a shot or a putt that got you going on your back nine, which is the front?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Let's see.  I made birdie on 2.  I hit it close; 2 was nice.  Then I saw one go in on hole 3 that was a little dicey little break there.  After that I felt really good with my putting.
Then I rolled a nice one, pretty long one, on the par 3 after that.  But, yeah, feel like I rolled it good all day.  Some didn't go in, but I stayed patient and I told myself that they were going to start falling in.
Q. You birdied the final hole today.  Is that good for mentality heading into tomorrow?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, I mean, I just want to keep this momentum going.
