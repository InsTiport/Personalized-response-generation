Q. Just wondering how you felt out there today.  Obviously looked pretty good.
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah.  Felt great.  The golf course is in awesome shape.  The game plan was to hit as many fairways as possible and then really be very disciplined with the second shots.  The greens are really firm out there.  So you can't really short side yourself.  So I was able to do that for the most part and made some putts on both sides.  So it was a pretty solid round, not many mistakes.  So I'm pretty happy.
Q. Is there any particular shot or hole that you feel was a particularly good moment for you?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Honestly, I felt like I played really steady all day.  I didn't do anything crazy.  Nothing that was a shot that got me like super excited or anything, but everything was really good all day.  So I'm really happy nothing really stands out.  But I like it like that.  Nothing really bad, but nothing really good.  I'll take it out here on this golf course.
Q. We were just talking to Keith and he was saying obviously he's 6-under and you're one stroke behind him.  I just wonder when you both are up there, are you keeping track as it goes on or do you just look at the scoreboard when you're done?
ABRAHAM ANCER: I don't, especially not in the first day.  It doesn't really matter.  Obviously you want to get off to a good start, but I'm not looking what place I'm at, especially even if I'm leading, I don't really care.  All I want to do is stick to my game plan and play as good as I can.
