 Q.  Thoughts on the round there?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Very solid round.  Bogey-free always is a good thing, especially out here in the playoffs.   
I felt great.  Hit the ball good off the tee.  Stayed patient.  Some putts didn't go in on the front nine and I just stayed patient and made some coming in.  It was nice.  A solid golf course like this with a little bit of wind you have to shoot a lot under.  5-under I'm very pleased.   
 Q.  The birdie on the last had to be nice to close?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yes, always nice.  Hit some good shots, and some nice putts.  It was a nice finish.   
 Q.  Are you thinking at all about trying to make it to next week, any pressure next week?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: 92nd.  I've got to make a good jump on it.  Came in with no expectations, just play like I've been playing all year, and that will take care of itself.   
 Q.  Still the plan for the next three days?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Same thing.  Just play what I've been doing, stick to my game plan.  And the thing is if I stick to my game plan and if I roll the ball good it's going to be a good tournament.  I'm just going to do the same thing I did today.
