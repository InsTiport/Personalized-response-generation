Q. How pleased are you?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Actually very pleased at the way I played. Just one bad swing today cost me two strokes, exactly where I didn't need that to happen. Felt like I was going to be able to make a couple birdies to put me back to where I already was.
Really proud of how I stayed patient. I feel like if I had not stayed patient, I would not have tied for fourth or whatever I'm at. So proud of that. Just feel a little mad about that swing but other than that, I can't complain. I played like I wanted to play. Proud of that.
Q. Top five in a World Golf Championships, you'll take that any time, wouldn't you.
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, for sure. These are big events. We're going against the best players in the world, and just putting myself in contention and having a chance there, I knew I needed to do something really, really special to have some sort of chance today. I was on track there for a little bit.
But yeah, like I said, I'm really proud of the way I played.
Q. This is your best result since THE NORTHERN TRUST a few months ago. Looking forward to the next couple of months ahead, how does it set you up for the Australian Open defense and then your first Presidents Cup?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Yeah, I wanted to get some good result before heading into there. I didn't get the results I wanted in the past tournaments. I feel like I didn't play that bad. I just wasn't really scoring that well. So I knew it was close. I just had to stay patient, which paid off this week being -- doing that.
But yeah, it gives me confidence going into Mayakoba, my next event a golf course that I like a lot, and playing in front of my people, as well. After that, I go on to Australia. Just trying to get good momentum to head that way.
Q. Sum up your three-week swing in Asia. You're one of 17 players who played all three. How was experience?
ABRAHAM ANCER: Really good. Last year I played Korea and that's it. Obviously Japan is the first time they do it, which I loved it. I'm sure I'm going to be back next year. I really enjoyed my time over here. I really like the golf course, especially Japan and here. I'm a big fan of the golf courses.
So yeah, like I said, I am ready to go home. I'm ready to see my family and friends, and just sleep in my own bed and have some tacos. That's what I'm missing the most.
But other than that, I love my time here. I had a great time trying new food every week, and I enjoyed it. It was a good experience.
