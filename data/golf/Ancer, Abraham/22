 Q.  So first off, what a great round. 63 in the final round. What was working so well for you out there?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: I was hitting it. I hit the ball well off the tee, really good iron shots and I started making some good putts. All week, really, I hit the ball great off the tee and iron shots, and in the first three rounds I feel like I didn't score as low as I should have for how good I hit the ball, but stayed patient and today the putts started to fall in.   
 Q.  At what point did you look up at the leaderboard and realize you might have a real chance at this?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: On 17, right before I hit my tee shot I realized I was tied. I thought I was going to be maybe two, three back, and then I looked up. At the beginning of the round, I just said I just need to make as many birdies as I can and try and see what happens. So I wasn't paying much attention to the leaderboard. And then that's when I noticed and I was like, all right, well, we got to make two other birdies. I made the putt there on 17, which was big, and then just couldn't make it happen on 18. But I played good, man. I'm proud of how I played.   
 Q.  You've been knocking on the door for your first win out here on the PGA TOUR for a couple of tournaments. What do you take away from this week that's going to help you down the line?  
ABRAHAM ANCER: Well, it was good shooting a low round like that when I needed to, shoot a very low one to have a chance. And I knew that and I knew the shots I had to pull off and that just gives me a lot of confidence. Seeing the ball go in a lot, making a lot of birdie, obviously, moving forward definitely gives me confidence.
