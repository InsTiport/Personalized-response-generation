ABRAHAM ANCER: I wanted to play with Tiger just because when I played with him in MÃ©xico, I got a lot out of those two rounds, even though I didn't play my best, but I felt a lot better once I was in contention again. That's why I wanted to play with him, and plus the experience of playing with one of the best players, or the best player to ever play the game in an atmosphere like this, pretty awesome. I don't know who wouldn't like to do that.
It was tough. I knew I had to bring my A Game or my A+ Game to have a chance. Unfortunately I didn't play my best. I fought till the end, and yeah, pretty gutted about today.
Q. As a whole, what was the experience like for you and the rest of this team?
ABRAHAM  ANCER: It was incredible. I'm really proud of all my teammates. We really tried our best. That's why it stings a lot to lose this way. We're making progress. I feel like we're a team now, and what I've heard of past Presidents Cups, it felt like it wasn't really a team.
Ernie did a phenomenal job with all the captains. I'm really proud for being a part of the Internationals.
