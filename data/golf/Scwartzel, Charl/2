Q. This is termed 'Africa's major.'  How much do you look forward to coming here and playing this Nedbank Golf Challenge every year?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Obviously as a South African, this tournament is really close to us, and it's the first tournament that I came to watch live and watch your heros play.  For us, I think it's probably more special, and for the foreigners, it's a great tournament; Sun City is a great venue.  It's always really good to be back here.
Q. A good test, as well.  A lot of factors that you have to take into account on this golf course?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It does.  You have all the clover greens, with the altitude it makes it really difficult to be precise with your iron play, and saying that, that is the key to playing well here.  Iron play has really got to be on point to make birdies.
Q. You tied 12th here last year, off to a great start but perhaps a little slow over the weekend.  How was the game for you last year?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I can't remember.
Q. A 69 on the opening day.  A 73 on Friday?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I've had close calls here.  I came second the one year.  I find with the wind, it plays tougher and I play better.  The way it sits off the tee, it's very difficult for me to be aggressive being a fader of the ball.  So when it's difficult, I can play a little bit more defensive and still sort of shoot the same scores as I was if it was going to be easy.
So saying that, I hope it's difficult.
Q. How is the game coming into this week?  In good shape at the moment?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's good.  It really is.  I feel like by game is as good as it can be, and I've got to just put tournaments behind me and wait for it to change.
