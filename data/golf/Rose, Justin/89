 Q.  Just talk about your round a little bit out there.  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, really happy with my round today.  I think I played fantastically, if I'm honest.  I drove the ball unbelievably well today, which obviously sets up the opportunity to score well.  With a couple of holes to play, I was a little frustrated I hadn't gotten more out of my round.  I felt like it was a day that I could have gone low.  There was a few opportunities on the lead.  I felt like I putted okay, but there were a few opportunities on the greens that I would have liked to have taken advantage of.  But the birdie-birdie finish made me feel like I got enough out of the day to make me happy.   
 Q.  If you drive it well, you can be aggressive with shorter irons in your fast.  Is that kind of the case?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, very much so.  The only thing I struggled with today, I feel like the ball sits up so much in these fairways, and with my wedge play, the ball was going a long way out there, and that's just what I didn't quite trust with a few wedge shots today.  So I'm going to go work on that on the range a little bit.  I think maybe because I thought it was going to go further, I didn't commit to a couple wedge shots which ultimately cost me on a couple of occasions, but certainly 17, where I managed to hit a poor wedge, I managed to make a putt, so that kind of canceled it out.   
 Q.  Did it feel different teeing it up today as World No. 1 for the first time?  
JUSTIN ROSE: I mean, obviously I'm aware of it.  Yeah, when you think about it, it's cool.  But I got into the zone today pretty quickly, and obviously I did my job, which means that obviously I didn't let it kind of get in my head too much today.  But a couple times when I started to feel frustrated, I tried to use it as inspiration.   
 Q.  How was the energy out there today?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, pretty chill still.  I think they were all out front with Tiger, so I think obviously with him in the last group tomorrow, I think the back end of the field is going to have a lot more energy.  But yeah, awesome.  The crowd here are great.  They know this golf course so well that they know what's a good shot around here.  They know where the side boards are.  They know where pins are tough and where the wedge shots can feed in from.  I think the people who come here have watched golf here regularly, so they really understand this golf course, which is cool.   
 Q.  Is the scoring about where you thought it would be today?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I think it's pretty condensed.  Obviously 3-over par is the worst, and everyone is within eight.  I'd say everyone goes to bed tonight, flex schedule a good start if you're under par, I would say.  If you can just keep it around par the first day or steal a couple you've got something to build on for the first of the week.  I saw a 5-under out there today for sure, and I think the course played fairly.
