   STEVEN FRANKLIN:  Thanks for coming in again Justin.  It doesn't seem that long ago since you were last here, but in the intervening period you had a 70, following a 66, which should leave you well placed for the weekend.  Maybe give us your thoughts heading into it.   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, definitely, I think I'm certainly very happy with the score today.  Really I think the finish made a bad day a good day really, just birdieing the last three holes.  That was a great way to finish and salvage the day for me.   
 STEVEN FRANKLIN:  Seven birdies and five bogeys, a little bit of a mixed bag for you.  Anything you can put your finger on?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Just I didn't play that well.  I didn't hit enough fairways.  I seemed to bogey all of the tough par 4s:  1, 3, 13, 15, notoriously the tough holes.  And I didn't seem to get the ball in play off the tee, and therefore, you're always struggling.   
  
  Q.  How's your back?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, it was all right.  It was the neck that went today!   
 I felt fine actually. My warm-up wasn't brilliant.  I felt a little bit stiffer this morning I think obviously due to it being early in the morning, but it was no problem once I got out there and got going.   
 I did feel a bit tight, just generally everywhere this morning.  But yeah, once I warmed up everything, it all worked out.   
  
  Q.  After the bogey at 15, did you say anything to yourself, I know that you've started the meditation and things like that, but was there one for calm -- (question muffled).   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  No, I just cheered myself up really.  I said:  All right, come on, let's squeeze something out on these last three holes.  I wanted to birdie two out of the last three, and that's what I said to myself over the putt on the last.  I said, "Well, you know, you birdied two of the last three.  There's no pressure on this putt, just roll it."  Obviously fortunate it went in.  But yeah, those are my thoughts coming in.   
  
  Q.  What were your birdies on the last three?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, it was a 5-wood and a pitching wedge to about 14 feet at the 16th hole.   
 I hit driver and 3-wood on to the green on 17 and 2-putted from 40 feet.   
 And the last hole I hit driver, 3-iron into the front left green-side bunker and holed an 8-footer.   
  
  Q.  Were you in a bit of a rush this morning; didn't have a chance to get out of your jeans?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, I guess.  I've had a few comments today.  They are not strictly jeans but I think the orange stitching makes them appear that way.  Actually, I may as well clear this up now.  All of my trousers are cut exactly the same way, and it's a style like, but the stitching may make them appear a little too casual possibly.   
  
  Q.  Comments from the players?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  No, from -- well, one this morning from my playing partner, Cambo.   
  
  Q.  Which was, what's that?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Exactly that, pretty much, so I don't think I'll wear them again.  (Laughter)   
  
  Q.  Were there any comments at Augusta?  You wore them at Augusta, didn't you?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  No, they were black trousers with red stitching.   
  
  Q.  Will you be consulting Poulter about what to wear?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  No.  I don't want to get roped into the same dilemma he faces every morning.   
  
  Q.  Did they let you into the clubhouse wearing them?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  They did.  I have an orange shirt on; hard to find a pair of trousers to match.   
  
  Q.  Long time since you've won at home.  Pretty excited with two rounds to go?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, I'm excited for sure.  It's a great start, and it's nice to be in the hunt really going into the weekend.  Tomorrow is much the same as today.  It's about just jostling for position and trying to sort of stay with the lead or as close to it as possible.  That's really the goal for tomorrow, as well.   
  
  Q.  Did the birdies bring the "whahey" celebration who spoke of yesterday?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  No, no, I don't think so today.   
  
  Q.  Too early, was it?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  It was a bit early.  Not enough people.  But actually it got busy, got really good crowds later on.  I think the tournament's been well supported so far, and it has a nice atmosphere out there.   
  
  Q.  Walking up to the opening drive, did you think it might be a penalty drop?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  I thought it was so bad it might be good.  That's what I was hoping for.  I was thinking it might be left enough because there's a couple of magnolia bushes down there that gobble up the balls.  But I think I hit it far enough left, I hoped that I was going to be okay.   
 But yeah, when I saw it in the flower beds, I was unsure whether that was going to be a free drop or not, but lucky it was.   
  
  Q.  Ten-minute wait on the tee couldn't have helped.   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, I guess somebody did a similar thing to me before -- was it Goose?  Yeah, to be honest, that wasn't the problem.  I was a little bit late on the tee anyway -- well, a couple minutes before my tee time.   
  
  Q.  While you're waiting for your next victory, is it difficult to remain patient?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Well, I feel it's only been a number of months.  What, it was in December or whenever it was, late November.  So it's not exactly been that long that I feel like I've been in the hunt feeling like I can win any week so I feel like -- no, there's certainly no frustration there.   
 Winning Australia was good.  Obviously there was a number of times -- it took a while for me to win in Australia from my last win, but if I look back to that, it hasn't been that long at all.   
 STEVEN FRANKLIN:  Okay, with no further questions, Justin, thank you very much, and thank you for the fashion advice.  Good luck this week.
