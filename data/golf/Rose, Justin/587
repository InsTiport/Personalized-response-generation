   JUSTIN ROSE:  That was a good round under the circumstances. I actually felt a bit under-prepared this week. I spent last week on the beach. I came here on Tuesday and didn't feel my game was in great shape. I felt a bit rushed but taking all that into account, a 69 was good. I've had some treatment on a niggle wrist injury but it hasn't caused too many problems. 
 It was really nice early but the wind has picked up and that will firm up the greens. 
 Nice to get back here after four years. I don't think we play many better courses. It's tough but not extreme. It's fair. 
I thought the key was to drive the ball and keep it on the fairway. I felt a bit uncomfortable with my driver today so shooting 69 was pleasing. I managed to scramble around the green. 
 I went to Heath Slocum's wedding in the British Virgin islands. With such a long schedule coming up I think a hard week's practice would have been the wrong thing to do with so mnay big weeks coming up. You have to keep stealing a few shots from this course to stay in contention and that's what I managed to do today.
