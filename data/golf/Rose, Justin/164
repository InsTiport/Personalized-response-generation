Q. How would you assess your round out there today?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I think I probably got pretty much what I deserved. I played well. Even par is still a good score around here. But just a couple mistake stops it from being a really good day. 
Came up short with a wedge on 14, that was a mistake you can't often make ‑‑ well you can't make here. 
And then the bogey on 18 is maybe a disappointing way to finish. 
But other than that did all the good things, birdied the par‑5s, and hit some good shots and I'm in decent position going into the weekend. 

Q. The weather's supposed to get better. Just talk about that looking ahead for tomorrow?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I think that the course is going to play incredibly fast tomorrow. I think that, I believe it's going to be cold in the morning, which normally does a good job of really sucking the moisture out, if there's low humidity along with that. 
So I think by the time tomorrow afternoon comes along the greens are probably going to be as fast as they have ever been, in my opinion. 
And Sunday, very much the same. 
Which is exactly how you want to play this golf course. I think we have actually been quite lucky with the weather, with all the storms of Monday and Wednesday to have the course playing somewhat firm and fast is going to be a lot of fun. 
There's been no mud balls all week, which, again, is, mud ball and wind, it would have been tough. But the course has held up incredibly well, despite all the rain early in the week. Obviously the heavy winds have been tricky for us, but not so much for the golf course conditions, it's done a good job of drying it out.
