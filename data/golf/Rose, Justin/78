Q. What does this feel like, given the importance of the top match?
HENRIK STENSON: Very nice.  It was a tough match and we were up there coming into the last couple of holes, and Brooks, he hit a lovely shot into 15 and I didn't hit my best shot into 16 and it all got very interesting from there on, but a couple of big putts from me that I managed to squeeze in the right direction.
So yeah, that was awesome.
Q. First out again, leading the Europeans.
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it's a place we've got comfortable playing.  It seems to be -- we knew I think they were going to do something different, try to match up a strong pairing against us and Brooks and DJ are formidable, 1 and 3 in the world, incredible game and they play a similar game.
We hung with it.  We knew like yesterday, if you can keep around even par in foursomes -- and it was probably hard for them to find their best stuff this afternoon, too.
