  Q. (Question about withdrawing.)
 JUSTIN ROSE:   Disappointing to have to WD.  It's been an exciting week.  Playing, obviously, back in front of fans and, obviously, quite a visible WD, playing with Jordan out there, who got off to a great start.  But, yeah, just kind of woke up with a bit in a sort of spasmmed lower back today and tried to kind of get through it.  My warm-up was hard work and I just couldn't stay down in a shot.  I missed basically every golf shot left to start the day.  Even my little chip into the 4th hole out of the rough from the left-hand side was creating pain.
 And just kind of, with the eye on next week and what have you, I just felt like it was a prudent call, just to call it at that point.  But I felt bad with Jordan having momentum to sort of change, change the vibe of the group.
