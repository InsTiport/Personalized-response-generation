  BILL MACATEE:   67 today, congratulations, talk about the putt at the 18th.  
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I mean that was a quick putt.   One that I was taking the high line on, and it definitely wasn't going to be racing, that one.   Everything away from the clubhouse down to Rae's Creek is quick.   That was kind of a bonus putt.   Picking the high line I was giving myself a chance to make it.  
BILL MACATEE:   You've done such a good job grinding back on the second nine over the last two days.   How important is it to be in this final pairing?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, obviously when I made the putt that got me one ahead of Phil and got me into the final pairing.   That's going to be a big experience tomorrow, fantastic experience.   Jordan is playing incredible golf.   It would be great to keep an eye on him and try and to sort of keep pace.
