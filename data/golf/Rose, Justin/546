  Q. Just sum up your day for us.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously just a tough golf course. You're battling out there all the time.   
 Didn't do a whole lot wrong really. Made some key putts and kept some momentum going at points when I was struggling in my round and a couple of times when I made a birdie I followed up with a bogey a hole or a couple holes later. So tough to get a run going.   
 At the same time, it's a decent score. I think it put me in the tournament. I could build on it. I always knew this afternoon the greens would be tricky. It's never easy to putt on them if they are firmed up. Come out tomorrow morning -- great to finish really, come out tomorrow morning and feel like you have some fresh greens and feel like you can put a score together.  
  
  Q. After the suspension, questionable whether you would finish; were the conditions much different when you came back out again?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: The wind dropped down a bit which was nice but it's a strange atmosphere once you come back out. It was very dead, very quiet, hard to keep the same vibe going really.  
  
  Q. All ready to play for tomorrow.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: No doubt.
