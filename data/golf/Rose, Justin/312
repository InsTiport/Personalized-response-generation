 Q.   Frustration out there?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, obviously some parts of the golf course are really easy out there.   Getting close to the pin with your irons is easy, but that's if you catch a good lie in the fairway.   Obviously the fairways are completely saturated right now and the fact that they are so wet probably is a good thing it's not picking up much mud.   But if it drys out at all, it's going to be really‑‑ it's going to be a nightmare out there tomorrow if we don't get a little rain from now until then.   The ball is going to pick up so much mud, which is obviously tough conditions to play in.  
I had it going.   I was 5‑under through 13 there.   I was looking to get it to maybe 7 or 8 for the round and who knows where that would put me going into tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What happened to the two bogeys?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, just pulled‑‑ I hit a three‑quarter 8‑iron and just pulled it a little bit left, failed to get up‑and‑down and then what I thought was a decent iron shot into 16, just left of the hole and it caught a ridge, rolled off the green and didn't get up‑and‑down.   So basically a couple short game errors.  
Definitely felt like the short game was better.   The putting was better today.   I really struggled the first couple of days.   Hopefully I can keep it going tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   How would you compare the conditions of today to yesterday?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   No.   It's still no wind out there.   Whenever you get calm conditions, providing you have good lies, guys are going to go low.  
   
 Q.   I saw the Tweet you sent out this morning of you and Rory.   Got the feeling you felt the bird had flown, that you were going to throw everything at it anyway?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I would say the winning score is going to be 16, I would imagine, somewhere if that realm.   When you start even par, you got to go all guns blazing.  
I felt like I could have got halfway there today, but it wasn't to be and just sit and watch now and see what everyone does this afternoon.   Always something to play for.   You always play for pride.   It won't be and overly exciting day tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You sound a bit flat?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, nothing much to be excited about really, is there, I suppose?   Damage was done first couple of days, I suppose.   I mean, I played well too so I had every opportunity to‑‑ as poor as I putted the first here the first couple of days here for a while, so that was the frustrating part for me.   I think if I had putted well, as I looked at it I could have been 7, 8, 9, 10‑under par.   When you are giving out that many, that many short ones missed, it's frustrating.   
   
 Q.   People talk about Rory's driving, what about his putting?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   He's putting so much better.   His stroke looks so much better than it did about a year ago.   So yeah, I don't know what changes he's made, but yeah his stroke looks great now.   
No matter how well you play, you've always got to convert on the greens.   I agree with you absolutely.
