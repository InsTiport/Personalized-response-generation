Q. Talk about your thoughts of the round.  Saw a lot of really low scores out there today.  Do you feel like maybe you left some out there?
JUSTIN ROSE: I'm happy with the way I scored considering how I played.  I played poorly today, really struggled, didn't hit my irons well at all.  So obviously that's what -- to make birdies you got to hit your irons well, obviously.  Did a decent job of hitting the fairways on the front nine, creating the chances, but iron play was off today.  Really scrambled well, to be honest with you, putted it pretty well, I got the ball to the hole.  The greens were much better today.  Still just can't get my irons to -- I think you have a lot of putts that break a lot -- I think I was talking about this yesterday, break a lot, but you still got to hit them firm, which is a bit counter intuitive.  So still trying to get the eye in a hundred percent on that.  But statistically putting it well, chipping it well, driving it okay, and just the iron play was where I was a bit off.
Q. (No Microphone.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Well, it's a bomber's paradise from that point of view.  It's a ball-striker's golf course.  Because it's soft I think obviously the pins are really, really tucked today, so if you do drive it really well, then you could have wedges to be aggressive into those corners of the greens.  Couple more feet of pins today, I think.  Yesterday saw some pins up on little knolls and knobs and stuff.  But it's very -- a few of the balls you could spin the ball to it and I think that's why you saw the scoring go low.  Especially, obviously, fresher greens this morning, guys able to make some of those more mid-range putts.  But I was surprised yesterday that 3-under was fourth or fifth or whatever it was at the end of the day.  I felt like the scoring was going to be a bit more indicative of today.  The start of the week I felt like this was a 20-under par golf course.  It looks like we're kind of edging in that direction.  Some rain this afternoon, yeah, you need this course to firm up pretty quickly for scoring to dramatically change.
Q. (No Microphone.)
JUSTIN ROSE: My short game around the greens is pretty good, but I keep catching bad lies in the fairway bunkers, in furrows and grooves.  That really hurts to make clean contact out of the fairway bunkers today.  So sometimes you kind of catch those beautifully clean lies and other times you don't.
Q. (No Microphone.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, number 4.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So yeah that was a good momentum, that -- I was staring double bogey in the face there and was able to par up-and-down there.  And that's one of the tougher holes on the golf course, so you walk off with bogey, of course it's disappointing, but you know you're not losing a whole shot to the field it's probably more like a half a shot.  So that was an important up-and-down.
Q. How were the crowds this week?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, crowd's been brilliant to play in front of.  Obviously this time of year you do get a lot of Ryder Cup on people's minds.  In some cities we go to they sometimes can cross the line a little bit.  Especially playing with Jordan, two European guys playing with Jordan, who is obviously maybe not a hometown favorite, but with the Grand Slam in every everyone's mind he's a huge favorite.  Good camaraderie out there.  Just being very genuine and, yeah, they have been very respectful, fun.  Big crowds too.  Lots of kids as well.  Lots and lots of kids out there.  Obviously school holiday.  So it's been fun to play out there.
Q. (No Microphone.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, no, no, no, no excuses, I'm afraid.
Q. (No Microphone.)
JUSTIN ROSE: I was early in the week, but not now.  I'm all good.  Yeah.
Q. Struggles with the irons, is that maybe because of some down time and you didn't have a lot of practice coming in, do you attribute that to that at all?
JUSTIN ROSE: I've been battling my iron play really for a couple months I feel like.  Even at the Scottish Open I haven't been a hundred percent happy with it.  So I know what I want to do, I'm just not quite doing it yet.  And then sometimes when you're on the golf course it's hard to know if you need to do more or less of what you're trying to feel.  I don't know if I need to exaggerate or just turn it down.  So, but, yeah, keep working.
