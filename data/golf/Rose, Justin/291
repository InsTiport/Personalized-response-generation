Q.   Good going is it when you shoot 65,64 on the back of being 4‑over early stages?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I think I've done my part but I didn't bank on everyone else going as low as they are.   Obviously Mr.Levy is going ridiculous out there right now.   I would have thought I'd be in a bit better shape going into Sunday than I am, but obviously every credit to the lads that are keeping it going out there.

Q.   A bit galling, isn't it, when you come in and spot yourself still seven adrift?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it is.   I reckon I could have‑‑ if everything went my way today, five better is what I could have been.   I missed probably five putts inside eight feet today and still shot 8‑under par. 
So every hole I had a chance.   I had three eagle putts out there, so plenty of opportunities to go low.   I just think you have to take it easy on yourself.   The greens are not perfect.   They are very soft so there will be a lot of traffic and spike marks.   That's how I'm rationaling the couple missed ones but that's going to be the same for everybody in the field. 
Quite clearly there's lots of birdies to be had out there and I don't know if things are going to change tomorrow, I hear there's a bit of wind coming in so that might spice things up.

Q.   Clutching at straws with that?
JUSTIN ROSE:   You know, if Alex has a bad day, then you look at the second guy, Jamie at 18 and maybe I'm three behind.   I always try to look at it like that because you never know what the leader is going to face on a Sunday so you always have to look at second and go from there as well.   So in with a half chance.
