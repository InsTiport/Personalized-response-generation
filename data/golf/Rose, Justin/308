  JUSTIN ROSE: I feel the atmosphere and obviously, yes, we have a job to do as a team, and obviously as a partnership, I suppose.  But the first tee of a Ryder Cup is long anticipated, I think tomorrow morning will be electric.  There's no doubt we'll hear it for about for about 45 minutes while we warm up and I'm sure it's going to be an amazing buzz on the first tee.Q. What did you find out and what was your initial reaction?JUSTIN ROSE: Pretty much knew last night that that was going to be, so I've been comfortable with that all day.  Yeah, it's a role that I'm looking forward to.Q. And I guess your games complement one another?JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, more so personalities and friendships, but comes down to game at the end of the day and obviously Henrik is a wonderful player and we should gel well together.Q. Going up against Bubba and Webb, how do you feel about that?JUSTIN ROSE: I'm one for one playing those guys.  Poults and I beat them in four-ball, foursomes and I lost to them in four-ball at Medinah.  A dangerous partnership and certainly no underestimating them.
