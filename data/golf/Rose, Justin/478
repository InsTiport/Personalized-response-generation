  Q. Decent finish.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, played nicely on the front nine actually. And I had two 3-putts on the par 3s to go a couple over and then birdied 8 and 9 to get back to even.   
 The guys that are playing the front nine, especially the first few holes on the front nine, that's where they were making birdies. And I made six at the par 5, had a little bad run around what I felt was the scoring area of the golf course.   
 And then just managed to -- got a little frustrated by that but managed to settle myself down and knew that I was not that far away. If you took a mean average of the scores, it was playing pretty tough.   
 I noticed a lot of guys in the black, so I kind of just hung in there. It's not a good start but it's not a bad start. Sometimes in a major, just hang around, hang around, and hopefully I'll catch fire one round and be right in there.   
 The finish has really made me feel good about the day, and as a whole I didn't play great. Hit it great on the range. I don't know what it is; I tend to hit it really well on the range but as guy through my round, as my body tightens or what happens, I can't quite keep the same feelings as I have going on the range.   
  
  Q. How is the neck?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Body is feeling healthy. I've got no pain. Last week that was a battle, and on Sunday I felt really good last week. I played well on Sunday so was hoping to carry that momentum through to today.   
 Haven't been getting off to good starts really all year. So I tried to change my mind to be a little bit more aggressive today, a little bit more positive, because the last few months, I've been trying to be really patient and go out there on Thursday and just kind of see what happens and not force the issue.   
 So I tried to change it up a little bit this week just to have a little bit more intention. Not a bad start I suppose.   
  
  Q. When you go out in the morning tomorrow, do you think that will allow you to continue to be aggressive?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: I mean, typically, yeah, the greens are pure here, but if you get the odd little spike mark out there, which you're always going to do, you won't have that in the morning and they might be a hair softer. Typically the wind is a bit calmer in the morning. It actually picked up a little bit today just enough to make some shots really tricky.   
 So you know, early wave is normally a shot easier than the afternoon wave, normally, so we'll see what happens.
