Q.   Talk about how it went out there today?
JUSTIN ROSE:   It was a fun day of golf.   It was nice to be in such a hot pairing with Bubba, both of us got going out there today, and both of us to be one and two after rounds, is a nice situation to be in.   I think we both fed off one another out there, and I guess in somewhat tough conditions.
When you see other guys making putts, making birdies, hitting iron shots close.   Sometimes you feed off it.   Others times, you can get frustrated that you are not going it yourself but this is one of those great moments where everybody in the group kind of got it going.

Q.   You see that a lot, guys just feed off each other.   Talk about what that's like when he makes a great shot; do you feel like you have to do it, too?
JUSTIN ROSE:   When you play with Bubba, he does it a little bit differently to the way I do.   He takes some lines that I don't have in the locker, and so I still have to focus on my own game for the most part out there.   I felt a lot more comfortable with the putter this week, again.   I think that's an area of my game that's been getting better and better each week.   Making putts is the key to going low as we all know.
