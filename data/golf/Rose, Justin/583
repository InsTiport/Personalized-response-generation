   JUSTIN ROSE:  I played terribly. I didn't hit many greens. I seemed to scramble for par all the time. Got off to a bad start, kept my game together in the middle then made two quick birdies on 4 and 6 and got it back to one over for the day which would have been a miraculous score based on how I played. Obviously I gave up two bogeys at the end, which was a shame. 
 It's amazing how 12 hours of sleep can change the feel so much. I am still in the golf tournament and hopefully I can get a good weekend. It's very tricky out there. If you miss on the wrong spot you can't get up and down. It's pretty relentless really. I know what I have to do. There is no great secret. Basically I have to get my rhythm back. I was a bit quick and jumpy today and a bit out of sorts.
