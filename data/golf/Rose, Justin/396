 Q.   Talk about the wind and the way the back played today as compared to yesterday.   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, absolutely.   No, the par‑5s are the biggest difference.   They were down breeze yesterday, they were into the breeze today, that makes a huge difference.   
12 was tough today.   Obviously that hole with any sort of wind is just, it keeps you guessing.   I hit what ‑‑ I hit a well struck shot that didn't do what I anticipated and hit it in the back bunker, which is a tough up‑and‑down.   
Amen Corner, obviously and then the two par‑5s are what I think makes the difference on the back nine.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE:   Just I need to warm my putter up.   I haven't made a putt in two days and I am where I am.   So I'm very encouraged by that.   
So I'm trying to stay patient right now.   And typically when I've won tournaments that's what's happened.   My putter has heated up on the weekend and I've been able to take advantage of my good play.   So I feel like I played very well the first two days and just waiting for that blade to warm‑up.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE:   No, around here you can't start jamming putts around here.   You just got to be patient and trust that they're going to drop.   I haven't had my run yet.   I haven't been on a run.   And typically in a tournament you always have a run where things go your way and you make some putts and you string your birdies together.   
And it hasn't happened for me yet this week and hopefully, it's not to say that it will happen, but if I stay patient, I give myself a very good chance that that will happen and hopefully it will and obviously it will get me right up in contention.
