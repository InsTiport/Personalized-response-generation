  JUSTIN ROSE: At least he has a chance to recover for tomorrow, hopefully.  I'm not sure if it's one of those things that's ten minutes or a day, I don't know.  Hopefully he'll be all right.   Q.  Did he say anything coming off the green?  JUSTIN ROSE: No, he didn't say much, actually.  I said just the stuff you have been struggling with recently?  And he said, yeah, same stuff.   Q.  Did he seem to have any issues before then?  JUSTIN ROSE: No, none.  He seemed chirpy, buoyant all day.  That was out of the blue, for sure.   Q.  Did you see him go down?  JUSTIN ROSE: No.  Just when I got to the bottom of the hill, like I said, I thought he went down -- it was a pretty severe bit of hill that he was, I guess, sitting on.  I thought maybe twisted his ankle.   Q.  Was there any sign at the start of the round that he might be struggling in any way?  JUSTIN ROSE: No, he was good.  He was in good shape, 100 percent.  His game was looking good.  His focus looked good.  He made a great up and down on 7, birdied 8, looked 100 percent.   Q.  Your bounce back from 7?  JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, with gritted teeth.  I've played so well really for two days, I feel like I've outplayed a couple guys that I played with.  I played really well and just got nothing out of it.  When I did feel like I got back to even par, I felt like I was very -- even 1-under I would have been delighted with, to be honest with you.  I needed something to go for me and I kind of had the opposite happen on 7.  Just uphill shot.  For some reason, when I've got a quite severe uphill lie, sometimes I can just chunk it a little bit.   Q.  On your second shot that came back into the bunker, I was curious, Mike Davis was on FOX and said it's a course where good shots get rewarded and mediocre shots get mediocre results.  Would you guy with that?  JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it was a mediocre shot.  I think it was a mediocre result.  I think it's an absolutely diabolical result for -- that's not a good golf hole, let's just be honest about it.  I don't mind the ball coming back into the a bunker, but when it comes back down the bunker on a down slope and you can't hit a shot because you've got fescue grasses hanging over the top and you can't make a swing -- that's why I tried to hit an inside-the-line, hooky shot.  I had no real line of play with the fescue behind me.  More for rugged terrain and stuff.  They have moved a lot of earth to create that.  I knew that would be the hardest hole on the course.  In my practice rounds, I hit some shots in that bunker. I fully knew how difficult that particular part of the golf course is.  Shame on me for bringing it into play with my second shot.  Other than that, I played really, really well for two days.  Hit a lot of great shots and haven't made any midrange putts.
