Q. How pleased are you with your week's work?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I'm very pleased.  I think I can look at it in many ways this week.  My short game was fantastic.  I putted really, really well.  Today I had six putts that touched the hole that didn't go in, so it could have been a really, really low round.
Yesterday I putted phenomenally well, felt good with the putter.  Drove the ball really poorly all week until today, so really fixed that, so can take a little momentum -- every aspect of my game I feel I worked on this week and saw signs of improvement.  All in all, turns out to be a top five finish or whatever, that will be a solid week when I haven't played my best golf.
Q. Just three dropped shots all week with an Open Championship at a similar golf course coming up, that must be also pleasing.
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, absolutely, there's a lot specific to links golf that I practiced this week, figuring out how the ball comes out of the rough, learning to play the flyer, obviously short game-wise, my short game was sharp.  Made a couple of bump and runs and hopefully stuff that will stand me in good stead for Birkdale.
Q. Obviously going back there in a couple of week's time, it will bring back some very happy memories for you?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, for sure, it's a course where I kind of sprang to fame I suppose.  Would be nice to come full circle and wrap up The Open Championship there.
