 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it was a really strange day, actually.  Starting out it was a really heavy breeze I was watching all morning, and we kept waiting for that torrential rain to come.  It was never really torrential at times, but constant the last couple of hours.  It was a weird sort of lull around 7, 8, 9, where the wind just dropped completely before it started blowing again.  I was actually wondering if we were going to get lucky with the weather for a couple holes.   
All in all it was a tough day.  The rain begins to be a bit of a nuisance at the end of the day, and the ball wasn't traveling far coming down the last couple of holes.   
Obviously Jordan playing in my half of the draw is leading the golf tournament.  And, yeah, it looks like -- the course, if you really do play well, there is a score out here.  The course plays so well in a heavy breeze.  It's a fair golf course.  You can be aggressive off the tee, if you feel like it.  Obviously links golf is all about avoiding the bunkers.   
But for me I didn't putt well today, a couple of unforced three-putts, on a day like today where you can't afford to give the cheap shots away.  Unfortunately I did that a few times today.  My bunker play was poor.  I don't know if it was because the sand was much more compacted because of the rain, but I really struggled out of bunkers.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, for sure.  Maybe I am beginning to lose my rapport with it pretty quickly, to be honest.   
I think they're definitely urging me on.  They want me to play very well.  Everyone remembers '98.  If I do get close to playing well, I can feel they're ready to go for me.  But it's up to me to make the birdies.  They're out here in droves.  Even coming down the last few holes, there are plenty of people there.  I'd be home having a nice hot dinner, but it's very impressive for the people that stayed out late.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: It's definitely made a difference worldwide.  It's definitely made a difference in the States.  It's resonated far and wide over there, I think.  And, yeah, and obviously it tends to transcend sport.  I watch other sports that I'm only interested in when it comes to the Olympics, and people watch golf because it's the Olympic Games, and hopefully that's one of the biggest sort of blessings I guess has been from winning the Olympics is it's exposed me to more people.  I've had more people congratulate me who don't even know about golf.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I mean I'll be playing fairly early tomorrow.  So it's going to be a quick turnaround.  Just a quick dinner.  Recovery is always important.  A hot shower is probably my first thing at the moment.  Try and come out.  Have a good weekend.  You always feel when you make the cut that winning is just out sight.  But the goal is it's important to come out and play a great round tomorrow morning.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: You know what, I think I'm going to stop watching the broadcast.  I think it frustrates me.  I do it every year because I enjoy golf and I enjoy The Open and I want to sit and watch.  When you have a 3:00 week tee time, it's nice to have it on in the background.  I don't think it helps my mental state.  I get a little more edgy from the round and I see guys getting the better of things out on the golf course, and I'm looking at the weather forecast thinking, what's going to happen with our round?  I think next year I'm never Open-free TV in my house.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Most other events I'd never have the TV on.  For some reason it's just this one because the coverage is so extensive.  And you can get those late evenings and early mornings.  There's a lot of time to kill sometimes between rounds.  I don't know why I do it here, but I'm going to stop doing it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I mean obviously with all the rain, the course is going to soften up, you can be very aggressive with your iron play.  I think the wind is laying down a little bit tomorrow, so that should offer the opportunity to have a bit more control with the ball and have the feeling like you can make some birdies.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Not going to give up, no.  Going to try and shoot 62.  Why don't go for a major record tomorrow?
