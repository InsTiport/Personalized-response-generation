Q.   You got them started with a bomb at the fourth, great putt to get started with, that had to make a lot of big smiles. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, that was good.   That settled my nerves for sure.   I felt like that got me right into the match from that moment on, believing in myself that I could make those key putts.   And I always believe that Poulter is going to do the same.   So between the two of us, we had it covered.
