Q.  Talk about your round today.
JUSTIN ROSE:  Back 9 again, really same as yesterday.  Yesterday I played the Back 9 5 under, today I played it 4 under.  If I can get off to a good start tomorrow, you know, continue my mojo on the Back 9, that would be nice.

I was just pleased with the way I recovered today certainly.  It's sometimes tough to recover from such a bad start.  But I stayed patient and didn't let it get on top of me.
Q.  Talk about the day tomorrow and your strategy a little bit.
JUSTIN ROSE:  I think obviously it's a good position to be in.  There's quite a few guys tucked behind the leader.  You know somebody's going to go low.  It's a matter of going out there and being aggressive from the word "go," being positive, but obviously playing controlled golf.

When you're two back, there's no time to hang around.  You're going out there with the objective to play a good round of golf.  No time to be nervous, none of that stuff.  Fire from the word "go."
