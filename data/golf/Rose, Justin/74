JUSTIN ROSE: I used the greens book most of the time and there's no greens maps here, so obviously I'm reading them with my eyes, which is how you should read putts, I know.  I feel comfortable reading putts I guess this week.   
 Q.  Talk about today.  The conditions were very tough out there and for you to go 5-under and make up a lot of ground?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, exactly.  It was the opposite wind today.  Although it was tough -- certain holes played much harder than yesterday and certain holes played easier.  The par 5s played easier, certainly No. 8 and No. 2 played easier than they did, but yeah, just found my moments to make birdies.   
Might have been a bogey-free round, so yeah, that's pretty tidy.  Those rounds don't often come, especially in breezy conditions.  I kept it mentally obviously sharp and I felt like towards the end of the round I was trying to whip myself and keep driving forward and making good decisions and good swings.   
I don't know what it is, four o'clock, it feels late here in China.  Gets darker than I feel it should be, but yeah, keeping my focus was the key to finishing off the weekend.   
 Q.  And what's the mind-set heading into the weekend trying to catch Tony with Patrick and Tommy, as well.  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously I played with Tommy the first two days.  He's playing beautiful golf.  Don't see that sort of stopping any time soon.   
Patrick, 64 yesterday was unbelievable round and Tony, I love playing with him.  He's such a great dude and such an awesome talent.  I look forward to being out there, probably with Patrick and Tony tomorrow.
