 Q.  Satisfied with a nice finish in the end here?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Close but no cigar around this course.  I think the last three years have been pretty much the same.  Played pretty well but it's such a bunched leaderboard that just one or two shots extra makes a huge difference.  Tied seventh is obviously a decent week and makes my job maybe -- I don't know if it makes it easier or harder next week.   
I don't know if that was a good week this week or not as regards to The Race to Dubai.  Certainly no one ahead of me seems to be playing better than me so I caught up a bit of ground on Rory and Danny and stuff like that, but it's going to be very tight going into Dubai.  I think I'm going to have to win that week I think now.   
 Q.  With that birdie at the last, you're up into third position, so it has been a good knock --  
JUSTIN ROSE: Well I think I'm seventh, I'm not third, I'm seventh --   
 Q.  In terms of The Race to Dubai?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Excuse me.  In that case it's a good week for sure.  I guess when you're second-last group and gets me right in the action, I've always knew I was going to have to win one of these two weeks, so hopefully I'm deferring and can finish on the grand stage well in Dubai.   
 Q.  In more general terms, I take it the game is in good shape, isn't it, really?  
JUSTIN ROSE: I don't want to whinge about it but I didn't really play that well this week.  Actually my short game, my putting were good.  Iron play was terrible this week, which for me is normally the strength of my game.  If I can sharpen that up going into Dubai, I feel very good about everything else.
