 Q.  I know ending with a bogey not the way you want to end.  Eight birdies on the day.  Are you pleased with a 5-under round?  JUSTIN ROSE: I guess so.  You can also knit-pick when you miss a short one at the end.  It's never fun to walk off the 18th.  5-under is a good start.  The course was there for the taking. I also feel that I was a little sloppy coming in on some decision-making.  Stay a little more focused tomorrow.  The way I played I felt there were a few more out there for me tomorrow.  Optimistic to come out in the morning, good greens and keep it going.   Q.  You seem to enjoy this event.  You won at Congressional, now a different course.  Something about this area of the country?  JUSTIN ROSE: Obviously the courses around here, they're good traditional golf courses.  I like the way they play.  All great tests of golf.  This one is more in front of you.  Bit more modern.  Really fun course to play.  I think if you're on with your iron play this week you'll make a lot of birdies
