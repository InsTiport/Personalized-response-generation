Q. Olympic afterglow I guess for Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson this afternoon.  The obvious question:  What was different from this morning?  I'm guessing the obvious answer is you just played better.  Is anything more than?
JUSTIN ROSE: I think it is a little bit more than that.  We played great this morning.  I felt like that's a match we could have been a lot more competitive in.  We didn't really put a foot wrong tee-to-green, but we didn't make any putts this morning.  We had a hard time reading them.  Sometimes when you haven't played a lot of golf with one another, certainly don't get in each other's -- when you're reading putts basically, you have to kind of learn once again how each other read them, and this morning we were having a hard time picking lines and then starting them on that line.
Anyway this afternoon, brilliant.  We obviously got running and dovetailed really well.
Q. Henrik, this morning must have left a little bit of a bitter aftertaste.  How much did that motivate you or is that something you just have to put out of your head?
HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, like I said, it's one I think thing if you're losing if you're playing badly but we were both pretty happy with our performance in the morning.  We missed a couple of putts and that's why we lost.  We're just going to go out and try and carry on, and even better, and we did that and made a few putts and got the point back.  Makes it sweeter though, when you beat the guys you lost to in the morning, that's for sure.
