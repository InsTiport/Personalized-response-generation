Q. What a contest, you gave yourself a putt for the halve.  Describe that occasion, describe that contest, a real battle today.
JUSTIN ROSE: It was a decent match.  It was close but it wasn't scintillating golf.  Yeah, just disappointed really.
Q. Difficult to take positives out of this, but the one thing we noticed was the tremendous spirit between the two of you playing.  You were a real credit to golf and to your teams today.
JUSTIN ROSE: Rickie is a great guy and is a friend of mine.  He's the future of the game, as well.  He does a great job of representing that.  You know, certainly I think it's important the players kind of showed an example out here.  There's always a tipping point, so yeah, basically Rickie is a class act.
Q. Does it feel like it might be slipping away from a European perspective?
JUSTIN ROSE: I think we needed my match, really, and then Sergio's match, and it becomes interesting at the back.  Yeah, just disappointed.
