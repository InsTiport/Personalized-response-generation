 Q.   After the three‑bogey start, you needed something fast to happen; describe your second shot at 14?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, nice 4‑iron, didn't have too much spin in the light, didn't have too much spin and nearly hopped in, an albatross, would have been nice.   That was exactly what I needed at that point.  
   
 Q.   How big a lift does something like that give you, something to build on?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it was great, because I was disappointed‑‑ between the rain delays‑‑ had another delay and another bogey, it just felt like a really long, hard day and frustrating start to the tournament.   
My gave me some good advice‑‑ inaudible‑‑ it can still happen, 69 holes of golf left, so keep it in perspective.   A few too many mistakes today and things were generally in easy shots, so if you hit good shots‑‑ I think they were expecting a lot of wind today that didn't materialise.
