   JUSTIN ROSE:  I am happy with a 68, and I guess it's a good start but when I was 5 under through 10 holes I thought it could be a bit better. 
When you play Carnoustie in good conditions like today you feel that if you get a good score on the board then you really gain against the field and set yourself up for a good tournament. 
 But I made a poor decision on the 3rd hole (my 12th) where I chose the wrong club off the tee and put it in a bunker. That halted my momentum a little bit, and it was annoying because I played that hole conservatively during the Open but changed my strategy today. Maybe I got impatient and tried to force something.
