  Q. 3-under par, 69 in the first round. It's cold out there.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, man, it sure is. But you know what, I was expecting worse. I pretty much put on half my suitcase today, so I didn't feel the cold. I was really dressed for it.  
 I think we got a little bit of a break because the wind didn't blow. It made it playable. A little bit of light rain was a nuisance, but if we would have had a 15-mile-an-hour wind it would have been tough today.  
  
  Q. It looked like there was a lot of standing water out there. Can this golf course handle much more than it's had?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: No, man. I think everyone is being very patient with the situation. I think you've just got to accept if you want to play you're going to have to just go out and get our feet dirty. Being out there you're hitting shots out of casual water because there's nowhere to go because you don't want to go in the thick rough. You're just having to accept that right now.   
 But the greens are phenomenal. You can't say enough about these greens. It's a shame because the course is absolutely perfect in terms of condition, and the greens are completely playable. It's unbelievable how dry they are.
