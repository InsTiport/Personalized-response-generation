  JUSTIN ROSE: Obviously satisfying to do that and to win it nicely, 5 & 4 on a long, windy day where you're maybe going to play 36 holes is a nice way to finish it off.   Q.  What about the key moments, what were the turning points of the match?  JUSTIN ROSE: Key moments, there was one as early as the second hole.  The first hole I felt we had a great chance to win.  My putt came up just short.  The greens were fairly slow starting out.  There was a bit of moisture in them. And then Bubba hit the green on the second hole.  Henrik and I both missed the fairway but Henrik wedged it to about eight, ten feet.  Bubba 3-putted, Henrik holed to win the hole. So it was a classic match-play flip where it looked like we were going to lose, and we ended up winning and that got us up and running. The ninth hole, again, was another big key turning point.  We were 2-up through the front nine and we had chances at 6, 7 and 8 to extend the lead and couldn't do it.  You are always aware when you're 2-up, if the guys go back to one, they really get back into the match.  So it was really important for us at 2-up to go 3 next mand that's what we managed to do at 9.   Q.  Are you surprised at how well Spieth and Reed have gelled?  JUSTIN ROSE: Not surprised but it's always, as a rookie -- well, surprised in a way.  They are great players, obviously, so you never count them out, but they have done really well as rookies to go out there and get the bit between their teeth early and obviously finish off a really strong pairing with Poults and Stephen.
