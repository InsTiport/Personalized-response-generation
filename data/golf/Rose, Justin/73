Q. Some players don't look so happy but you do?
JUSTIN ROSE: 69 was quite a good score.  There was quite a bit of wind and it was playing quite difficult out there.  But I actually think 69 is the worst score I could have had today.  I played really good golf.  It was possibly an 8-under par round today with the chances that I had, and obviously one poor tee shot on 18.  I had to reload off the 18th tee.  So that was two shots gone there.
But I feel good about things.  Good start.
Q. Compared to last year, you won here.  This first round feeling, is there something different?
JUSTIN ROSE: Just right on track.  You can't win it on the first day; you can only lose it.  69 is a good start, something I can build on for the rest of the week.  Came out pretty sharp with my game, and yeah, I'm excited for the next three days.
Q. Next day maybe you will have a different plan?
JUSTIN ROSE: No different plan.  You've got to stay patient.  Wait for your run.  I did everything right today.  I could have made more putts.  I made a few putts but I could have made more.  Just kind of feel like a lot of good things happened, so just keep doing that and I'll have my day where I come in 6-, 7-, 8-under if I play like that.  Like I said, good start.
Q. How was that today?
JUSTIN ROSE: I think it was a good start.  It was the kind of round I left a bunch out there.  I feel like I played well.  I hit my irons really close to the hole today for the most part and gave myself a lot of birdie putts.
I had to reload on the 18th tee, was well.  Hit one right into the water.  Got away with I guess a bogey in the end, but feel like I could have shot 65, 64 possibly, with how I played.
But I think all in all 69 was a good start to week.  It was a good start to the week and you had to play good golf to find the birdies.
Q. Don't want to dwell on the negatives, but it was a very unlucky tee shot.  What was wrong there?
JUSTIN ROSE: There was a bit of a wait on the tee.  We were all having a bit of a laugh on the tee.  Maybe just lost my focus for a minute.  The wind was I thought down off the right-hand side so I was trying to hit a very aggressive tee shot.
You can run out of fairway so quick on the left.  It was a bad tee shot with the right intentions because I was trying to be positive and play it down an aggressive line.
Q. Your last start, you were hosting the British Masters.  Nice to be out there concentrating on your game?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, being able to prepare for this tournament this week a lot better than I did the British Masters.  Felt a bit sick at the beginning part of that week and obviously with all the hosting duties, as well.
This week being defending champion, there's a couple extra media requests here and there but yeah, for the most part I felt very focused on the start this week.  Got to the first tee feeling great.  Obviously the journey is a tough one, getting over here to Shanghai, but the jet-lag hasn't been bad.  Yeah, I feel ready to play this week.
