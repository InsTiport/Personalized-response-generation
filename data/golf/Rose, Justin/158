 Q.  How would you assess your first day at the U.S. Open?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously, it was a long, hot, windy afternoon.  But there are still scores to be had out there.  The golf course has got plenty of moisture in it.  It's the kind of golf course that if you're on point and playing well and you're in the fairways, you really feel like you can be aggressive and attack and make some birdies.   
But as soon as you get out of position on this golf course, you're really struggling and suffering for par.  I felt like I slipped off a few fairways today, and didn't get all that fortunate with the lies that I got.  But that's the way it's going to be around here.  I think anytime you miss a fairway here, you got to expect a tough lie.   
So, from my point of view, I think equal par is about fair.  Though disappointing on the 18th.  I had 12-foot for birdie, and was really feeling like I was due to make a putt.  So maybe I was a little aggressive with it and missed the one coming back, unfortunately.  So even par in the end is maybe what I deserved all in all, but disappointing to finish it the way I did on the 18th green.   
 Q.  As a past winner here in 2013, how are you going to draw from that going into tomorrow's round?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I think Merion, in the first round, I didn't play a particularly great round.  I shot 71 which was middle of the field.  I just kind of hung around and hung around.  I think everyone's going to have their run of bad golf out there this week, and everyone's going to have their hot spell.  So I think for me I haven't had either yet, really.   
So for me I think it's just about persevering.  I believe there is a good score in me this week.  So if that's tomorrow, the next day or Sunday, hopefully I can pull a few shots back.
