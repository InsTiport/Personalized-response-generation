Q. Talk about your round. 
JUSTIN ROSE: Disappointed, I think. It wasn't a terrible round, but not what you're looking for on moving day. It was the kind of day I needed to put something strong together. I could feel the guys were making it happen. The course is obviously gettable. For me, I birdied 6 and 7, I kind of felt that it might start my day. And I was content through 9 holes, I knew I could still have a run in the back nine. I didn't get it up and down on 12 and 13. And that slowed me up. And it felt like a struggle coming in. But that sums it up pretty much.

Q. Couldn't get any momentum going. And obviously there's been cheers out there, momentum building?
JUSTIN ROSE: I haven't made the key putts so far this week. I've just not had that sort of rhythm with the stroke, to put the ball on the right speed. I've hit my line, missed the speed. You have to match both things up. More at Augusta than anywhere else. You're always starting the ball 18 inches, two feet, three feet outside the cup. The speed needs to be on, and that hasn't been quite the way for me this week. 

Q. How was the setup on the front nine any different? The golf course is softer, but was it any different?
JUSTIN ROSE: The par‑3 was shorter. No. 4 was up. But the pin placement back right is never easy. The wind was down on No. 5 and 7, so those holes played quite short. And No. 9 was playing quite short. The wind direction was favorable for some of the par‑4s on the back nine.
