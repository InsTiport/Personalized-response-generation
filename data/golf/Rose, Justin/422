  IAN POULTER:   It was crucial.   It was really important to come out on top of that match.   We was 2‑up, poor second shot from me on 15, 16, which caused us to lose a hole there.   But you know what, a win's a win.   
   
 Q.   How much pressure do you feel coming down the last?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   We won today‑‑ I feel like that was a good point for us.   I feel like we actually didn't have our best stuff today and to win that point was massive.   
   
 Q.   How about that first tee?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   I'll tell you about it, it was ridiculous.   
IAN POULTER:   It was a special moment.   That was pretty special yesterday, to pump them up.   It's amazing to take that first tee shot anyway, and I knew Bubba was going to do it today, so why not join him.
