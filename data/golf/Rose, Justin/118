Q. How do you feel about the round today?
JUSTIN ROSE: I feel good, I really enjoyed the round.  It was nice to chase a low score out there today.  Obviously it wasn't happening really through eight holes but made six on the spin, which is fun, really felt I like I could maybe birdie my way to the house and set something decent for the leaders to look at at least.  Disappointed obviously to finish -- hit it close at 17, wasn't able to make the putt, and then bogey 18 from the middle of the fairway, because that's, if you kind of can land on the front right of that green it feeds to the pin and I was a couple yards away from doing that but couldn't get it up-and-down from the fringe.
But I think today there was some more positives in my game to take forward into the coming weeks and all in all it was nice to finish strong.
Q. What's it like when you get on a birdie run like that?
JUSTIN ROSE: You don't want to think about it too much just trying to -- when you have six in a row obviously you start to think about it, but obviously even when you make two, three, four you're just trying to keep going one shot at a time.  This golf course does offer that.  I think Sunday pins, it's a little bit like Augusta in the sense of how the course is set up on Sunday.  If you hit the right shot at the right time you can feed the ball close to the hole.  So I was able to do that a few times today.
Q. Five eagle putts or something, five putts for eagle that shows your ball striking was on.
JUSTIN ROSE: I didn't make a putt like longer than six feet today it felt like.  I did it the hard way in a sense, but yeah, it showed the quality of my long game today was much, much better.  I think I've gone from horrendous yesterday to awesome today.  So I don't quite know which side of the bed is the wrong side or right side tomorrow, but, yeah, happy that I can take -- I changed my thought a little bit today with my swing.  I tried to focus a little bit more on the face, really just trying to control the face of the club and I felt like that really helped me to hit more shots rather than thinking more of my body.  I'm always a guy who likes to have a thought.  When I try to go blank and just hit a shot it never quite works out as well for me.  So, yeah, it clicked into a nice roll today.
Q. Just one of those days with the putter or do you feel like there's something you need to look at?
JUSTIN ROSE: No, I putted well here.  I find the greens really grainy and tricky.  I hit some good putts, I was a lot freer, I holed out really well from four feet, five feet, which indicates to me more how my stroke is and the rest is the art form of putting, just reading them, putting on the right line with the right speed.  And even the putt, second putt I hit at 18 was a really good putt, just stayed on the high side and, yeah, so those are kind of the things that it's tough to work on in a sense, but these greens are grainy and tricky.
