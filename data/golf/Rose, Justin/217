 Q.  First time to Pebble this week.  Pretty happy with how the week went?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I really enjoyed it.  I couldn't have asked for more from my first couple rounds at Pebble and certainly, the AT&T Pebble Beach pro-am first time.  Weather was great, I enjoyed everything about it.  I've heard all the negatives from all the players throughout the years and I didn't experience one of them.   
Other than the second tee box today, I didn't really wait on a shot for four days.  So, that kind of dispelled that theory of slow play and all that.  Yeah, there's certain things that you have to put up with, especially when you play in the celeb wave, there's some craziness.  But I used all that as good reasons to play and good reasons to test my focus and my concentration and all that stuff.  For the most part I did a good job.   
But, yeah to finish 12-under and to look back at how many wasted shots there were is encouraging.  I think I need to learn Pebble a bit more, a bit better.  This is the course that probably gave me more trouble than the other two.  That's why it's a U.S. Open venue, because it's got some subtleties to it.  But I really enjoyed it.  I really enjoyed the whole week, the courses are in great shape the weather was perfect.   
 Q.  Being inside the top-5, at 12-under, even if you're saying you didn't quite have your best.  Did you feel like you were maybe just a couple shots here and there or just knowing the course a little bit away from being in contention?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Absolutely.  Even today I still felt like I had a chance to win.  I made two 6s on the par-5s which both felt like double bogeys.   
Then I 3-putted from six, seven feet at the 10th.  I had a great birdie look there.  So, if it is your day, it is your day, right?  And you could easily say that's six shots.  So that puts me right in the hunt.   
So and that's kind of having a 4-over par back nine yesterday in there, too.  So, if I look at all those factors I'm pretty close to playing well, and I sort of -- it is my second event of the year, so off the back of a missed cut at Torrey Pines, I feel like I'm going into Riviera now with some confidence, which is -- that's what you want this time of year, to know that your game's very, very close.   
 Q.  Did you enjoy your experience with the other Justin this week?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Very much so.  He's become a friend, so it's easy when you have someone out there that -- especially someone of his profile.  You kind of -- it's nice if you know each other and you can have a bit of fun off the ball, and you're not trying to get to know someone in that environment too.  So we had a great time and hopefully we can do it again.
