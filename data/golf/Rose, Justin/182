JUSTIN ROSE: He just played incredible golf.  He was inspired.  He kind of punished us every time he had a wedge in his hands, he got it up-and-down.  Might have been sort of around 10-under if we let him away with a bogey on 12.  He was unbelievable.
We didn't quite have it.  I didn't have it this afternoon.  It's tough playing four in a row, as they did as well.  For Patrick to find that energy this afternoon is incredible.
Q. The United States dominated early yesterday morning.  You guys seem to own the next two sessions.  There's an ebb and flow.  What is the attitude heading into tonight as you prepare for singles?
JUSTIN ROSE: We're one closer than we were at Medinah.  It's going to be a monumental challenge tomorrow.  We're going to put out our lineup and we're going to look at each other man-to-man tomorrow.  It's going to be eyeball to eyeball on the first tee, no partners, no friends out there on the golf course.  Just go out and try to put a point on the board.  That's everybody's mission.
Q. You were one of leaders on this European team.  If you had to say something to your team, what would it be?
JUSTIN ROSE: Just basically pride in the bag and go out and be the best 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 you can be.
