 Q.  Try to describe how you feel?  JUSTIN ROSE: A half-point is half a point, but like we did on Saturday, it's a full point in terms of differential between the two teams. This Ryder Cup has a knack of coming right down to the wire.  The Americans came out kicking early on today.  ^  again we sort of anticipated that and I haven't really assessed the board but feels like we got back in control a little bit.  I know Henrik happened to lose the last, and if I had lost the last, I felt like momentum swung back that way so clearly I got fortunate on 18. Hunter made a very tough up-and-down and he went -- went for the brave shot and didn't come off and feel fortunate to have got a halve out of that but at this stage, every little bit helps and being 4-down I at the point working my tail out there just to try to get myself in the match with three holes to go.   Q.  Three wins and two halves in five matches, almost unprecedented; where does it rank in your list of achievements had?  JUSTIN ROSE: Really high up there.  I felt good today and I played a great match and Hunter was awesome today, he really was.  He was 5-under through seven and threw it all watt me and I responded with birdies at 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, and just really proud of just getting back into the match.  He's a great friend of mine.  We share the same full game and short game coach, so an honourable halve, I would say.
