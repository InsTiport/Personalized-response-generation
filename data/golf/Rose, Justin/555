   JUSTIN ROSE: A 20-second lapse in concentration, in hindsight I should have gone for the green. But one of those things, I laid up way too close to that green, and the way they grow the grain into you, I had a bit of a tricky lie and no yardage at all. So that was hard. 
 But that just proved I struggled with my concentration today. It was such a long round. Coming in last is tough and there's a lot of noise going on. That's what I found really tough coming in. I don't know if I didn't quite work my way around, but I was struggling out there. It was a tough finish. 
 But the round could have turned around nicely for me on 13, a good birdie chance there; 14, another birdie chance; par-5, 15th. I felt good about playing my way back into the tournament, not just trying to make the cut.

 Q. You showed fantastic resiliency over the years when you have suffered a few misfortunes. I wonder how tough it's going to be to regroup. Are there things in the back of your head saying, I'm out of this Championship? 
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, pretty much. Obviously I come in and there's plenty to play for sometimes, even if you're not meant to win. But yeah, obviously it's not going to be the exciting weekend I was looking forward to, exciting Saturday anyway I was looking forward to.
