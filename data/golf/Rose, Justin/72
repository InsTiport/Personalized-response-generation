JUSTIN ROSE: I played well today.  It was a good group to be a part of, obviously all right there.  I guess the three of us were leading all day pretty much.  I know Tommy got it going.  Looked like he had a bit of a mistake at the par 5.   
But anyway, yeah, tough finished.  Missed it in the spot you can't miss it on on 17 and that's such a disaster of an area.  You can't drop it.  You can't chip it.  You can't do anything down there.  So that took about half an hour.   
Great tee shot on 18.  It was a good bounce back there and just leaked a 4-iron a little bit, but yeah, so three back going into tomorrow, which is not exactly how it looked like it was going to be with a couple holes to play.   
But obviously I have a good opportunity.  With only one guy in front of you, you have an opportunity to play well tomorrow.   
 Q.  Very similar situation last year coming from behind again.  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I'm playing well, so I've got to go out tomorrow.  Shoot maybe something in the mid 60s and see if I can chase Tony down.  Obviously there's three guys at 10-under who are all going to be chasing pretty hard but nothing to lose tomorrow.  It's going to take a good round.  I'm playing well, feeling good.  Just got to put that last couple holes behind me and come out a little bit angry tomorrow.
