 Q.   You started the day three behind, up‑and‑down front nine, needed a strong back nine, what was the key to getting it?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   Telling myself exactly that on the 10th tee.   I said if I shoot 4‑under on the back nine I'll be in with a shout on Sunday.   That's what happened and I just kind of hung around really.   Hit some good putts that didn't go in, and one maybe disappointing 3‑putt on the back nine.   Just did what I needed to do.  
   
 Q.   Give us a sense of the atmosphere, 17 particularly sounds pretty noisy?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   A good crowd out there today, today being the end of the weekend, people seem to have come out, a nice vibe to play golf in front of.   17 wasn't too noisy.   Obviously Rory being the group behind and what‑have‑you.   It was a nice buzz all the way around.  
   
 Q.   Shot 62 in the final round two years ago, and Rory made five birdies in a row to beat you.   Any sense there's a really low one out there tomorrow?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   I think they are fed up with us shooting really low scores.   The pins have been two or three yards tighter this year to the edges, so I'm not sure there's that super low one.   
Obviously we have seen 64 this week.   I tried to shoot 64 yesterday with a decent 18th hole, so that's out there for sure.   But I think the pins have been tighter this year.   
   
 Q.   Making the turn at even par, but you finished with a 32, how much momentum do you think you built with that closing nine?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I said to myself on the 10th tee, and I actually said if I could shoot 4‑under on the back, I could have a chance going to Sunday.   Just set the intention was important for me.   I played some good golf on the front nine but haven't got a lot out of it.   To turn it around on the back nine and make the putt on 18 feels good and carry some momentum into tomorrow.   
Just to digress quickly, I watched an incredible round of golf today.   Rafa Cabrera‑Bello was unbelievable.   He really struggled with his game the first few holes, up‑and‑down, up‑and‑down, up‑and‑down, and then got some flow going.   He had 15 1‑putts today.   His short game was Seve‑like.   It was awesome.   
   
 Q.   When you see something like and you're playing with a competitor playing that well, do you take some of that energy as well?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   No, it shows you what you need to work on.   He was unbelievable.   He was chipping it to a foot and it was awesome.   Chipping around this golf course is difficult, very grainy, very tough, very sandy underneath the ball.   Yeah, it was a master class.   
   
 Q.   You're going to have to chase the lead tomorrow on a golf course that can provide some low numbers, what's your mentality?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   I think you have to pay respect to these pin positions around here, because yeah, if you hit the right iron shot it feeds to it but if you miss that iron shot, it's going to go away from the hole.   But I feel like the pins are one or two yards tighter that year than years past, so I'm not sure if there's going to be a super low one, Sunday pin is traditionally a little trickier.   From what I've seen so far this week, I think they are sick of us shooting 24‑under around here, so they are trying to make the course show a little more teeth to the pin potions.   Three or four back or whatever it's going to be, it's going to require a pretty low score.
