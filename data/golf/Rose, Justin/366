Q.   Things are clicking, and it was definitely clicking today. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it was clicking, absolutely.   It was a good, clean round of golf.   I felt like I haven't played a bogey‑free round for a while.   And that's what I managed to do today.
Obviously when the guys are going low, you obviously need to make birdies, but you also need to eliminate the mistakes.   Obviously you throw a couple of bogeys at it it's hard to go low.
Today there was a lot of putts made from 8 to 10 feet.   I hit the ball close all day, but I still made some good putts.   I felt very good about the putting today.   And obviously just kept a very clean, solid round of golf.   It came out of nowhere, as well, I felt kind of a bit lethargic, felt like I was plodding around and then all of a sudden I looked at the scoreboard and I was doing okay.

Q.   Your position, another low one tomorrow, you're right there, Justin. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, who knows how this course is going to play over the weekend.   I don't think the course is that easy, to be honest with you.   Obviously the scoreboard would suggest otherwise.   It doesn't take much for this course to play a little bit tougher.   The greens firm up just a bit and get 10, 15 mile an hour breeze it can be a different place. 
But absolutely, Saturday, keep pace with the leaders tomorrow, go out and shoot another round in the 60s and see where we stack up on Sunday and Monday, obviously.

Q.   Isn't it funny, you're lethargic, like you say, and then all of a sudden a few birdies and it all clicks in, everything changes?
JUSTIN ROSE:   It does.   For me everything changes with the putter.   And yesterday I felt like I played a really, really good round of golf, just didn't get much out of it with the putter and got frustrated and made a couple of mistakes coming in.   1‑under yesterday was a bit of a shame.   But I kind of got what I deserved.   I felt like I didn't hang in there tough enough yesterday.   Obviously I did a much better job of that today.
