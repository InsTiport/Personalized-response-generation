 Q.  Not too terribly bad.  JUSTIN ROSE: I threw my round away at the end.  I could or should have been 3-under par, probably through -- by about 12 or 13.  But I just couldn't get the ball in the hole and just a really weak finish, some poor clubs and some tired, lazy swings at the end. All in all, a little bit disappointed.  I felt like I finished poorly, but I felt like I could have gotten a lot more out of the day.   Q.  You mentioned tired swings, is it a result of the terrain, maybe?  JUSTIN ROSE: It's a long day, it's a long golf course.  Yeah, I mean, obviously it's been a long week trying to prepare for it, too.  But same for everybody, you know. I think more just the time.  It feels like it's getting dark.  It feels like it's a late night.  It's more a body clock thing more than a physical tiredness thing.   Q.  Tomorrow, new day, body regroup.  What's the strategy?  JUSTIN ROSE: I really hope the greens roll better in the morning because it wasn't a lot of fun out there in the afternoon.  I couldn't see a putt staying on the line I hit it on and makes it a little frustrating at times.  I'm hoping I can get some good looks at it tomorrow and the ball rolls a little truer, so I feel like I can make some birdies.
