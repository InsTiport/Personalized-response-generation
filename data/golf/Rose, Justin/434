Q.   Great playing out there for the first round, 4‑under.   Give us your impressions of the round at the layout here at the Barclays. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, obviously delighted with that round of golf.   The way I felt the course played for us in the afternoon, I was kind of blown away at how good the scoring was because I found it pretty tough out there.   I think a lot of flag placements were on the front edge of the green, and I think the greens were soft this morning and maybe guys could get at those pins, but this afternoon I thought it proved really tough to get it going low. 
But for me the key to the round was bogey free.   I ground it out really hard out there today and was a really good short game day, scrambled nicely and had 25 putts, which for me was a big turnaround.   Been working hard at the putting.   Good start, nice to get off to a good day.

Q.   You said bogey free.   What were the important shots that kept you that way during the course of the 18 holes?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Well, I birdied the 10th hole to get to 2‑under.   I felt like I had some momentum going, and then butchered my way up the 11th and made a 15‑footer for par, so that just really kept the round going.   I would say that 15‑footer was the key to the round.

Q.   With such a solid first round, got to get the juices flowing for the whole first playoff event?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, absolutely.   Great atmosphere out there.   New York is just an incredible place to play golf.   You have to sometimes just smile at it.   There's some great comments out there.   But it really is good fun to play.   Good energy, and I think it's only going to get more intense as the weekend goes on.
