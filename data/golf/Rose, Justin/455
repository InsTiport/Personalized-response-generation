Q.   What went well for you out there? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I played well today.   I hit enough fairways and enough greens where I didn't have to scramble too hard, but I've got to tell you, the course felt like it was playing really tough to me.   Every iron shot, you had to be right on.
And the greens were quick.   I felt there were some gnarly little pin placements out there, a lot of pins that were not that tight it was very tough to putt.   I made one putt today, I made about a 20‑footer on 15.   But other than thatdidn't make the greens; and being that that was the case, delighted to have shot 3‑under. 

Q.   Knowing how hot you can get in stretches, what do you feel is working well in your game right now?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Just generally everything.   I'm swinging the club well, hitting a lot of quality shots.   So that's good.   And my short game's pretty sharp.   So when I do miss, like for example, The Honda Classic, I only hit seven greens one day but managed to shoot 1‑over par with hitting seven greens. 
So I have the ability to grind it out with the short game and play well.   So a few strings in the bow right now, and it does boil down to making putts.   Last week at Transitions I led the field in greens in regulation and finished 29th, so making my fair share.   And hopefully the putter can once again heat up, but you have to be patient.
