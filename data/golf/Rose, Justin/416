Q.   You told us Doral was the biggest win of your career.   How would you compare the way you felt today in this match to that Sunday at Doral?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Well, one of the wise old vice captains that we have on our team said this situation can prepare you to win majors.   The Ryder Cup is as big as it gets, and to play Phil, I mean, he's a gentleman first and foremost, but he always seems to bring out the best in me.   To make three putts like I did on the last three greens, I feel like that's just been a lot of hard work paying off, and I wouldn't say I've made three bigger putts back‑to‑back in my career ever.
