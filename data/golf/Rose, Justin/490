  Q. 2-under par 68 in round 2. Didn't look like a lot of mistakes out there. On the greens though I made the observation it looked like you were hitting your line a lot, it was just a matter of reading correctly?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I felt like I over-read a couple today certainly early in my round, had the high line, trying to dive in. Who knows, maybe second-guessed one or two. But yeah, I think that was it today. I really putted yesterday. Yesterday I knocked in a couple of 20-footers, and that was probably the difference today.   
 I missed five or six greens but didn't make a bogey, so that was the good side of the round. If you can do that around here you're going to make one or two birdies.  
  
  Q. You're at the ripe old age of 30 now. You're still one of the young guys. Obviously in very good shape going into a 36-hole final Sunday. What are your thoughts?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it's going to be a long day, obviously 36 holes tomorrow, so at this point just keep doing what I'm doing. Just keep hoping the putter will warm up a little bit. I'm going to do a little bit of work now. But yeah, doesn't feel too far off. I didn't hit it very good coming down the last few holes. I began to lose a couple right.   
  
  Q. You're in a good position headed into the final two rounds, but it looked like it was kind of a funny day out there for your group.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously Stuart had a good finish there to get it to 10, and I was just trying to keep pace, keep myself just within touch going into the 36-hole marathon tomorrow. Yeah, I'm pretty happy with where I'm at. Obviously there are a lot of guys around the lead. It's going to take a couple decent rounds or one really low one, but you only achieve that by playing shot by shot and staying in the moment. The putter hasn't really heated up yet, so if that can happen tomorrow, who knows.  
  
  Q. What sort of mindset or game plan do you have going knowing you've got to play 36 tomorrow?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Patience, I think. You know, that's what's going to serve me well tomorrow. I won the Memorial coming from three back, so I know it's definitely possible, but you can't go out there and force things. If you're three back and make mistakes that's a hard place to play golf from, so just really take on shots when they appeal and not force the issue, I think.  
  
  Q. Are you going to rest or work on your game a little bit?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Actually feeling pretty tired right now. I might do some putting in the room. That's been working well for me this week, just get away from all the hustle and bustle and just do a little putting in the room. I think that's going to be my plan.
