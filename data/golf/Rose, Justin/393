Q.   How is the back?   You were struggling yesterday. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I struggled yesterday, I struggled overnight, and then actually to be honest with you, I was really pleased with how I felt out there today.   Pills are a wonderful thing. 

Q.   Did you get physio, as well?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, last night I just iced up.   When it's inflamed like that, physio, there's not much that they can do.   But I had some physio this morning before playing. 

Q.   Did it happen the first round?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Second round.   I think it was after my second round.   Literally walking off the course up the hill here towards the scorer's, I felt something go, and then third round it was sort of a little kind of sore early, but then disappeared through my round, but then I hurt it again with my shot into 17 yesterday evening. 
So I was a bit worried about it last night, but surprised how well it sort of worked out today.   No, I mean, I hit the ball really, really well this week from tee to green.   I thought it was as good as I could play.   Really just didn't convert on the greens, and that sort of led into the mistakes that I made today, really. 
I could just as easily‑‑ making the turn at 1‑under, you play a good back nine, you can finish this tournament 4‑, 5‑under par quite easily.   You know, I think I've played well enough to win this week tee to green, and that's obviously‑‑ we all know that's half the game.   The other half is still eluding me right now, but I know where I need to work.

Q.   Luke said even though you come back year after year, it's still a place you can learn.   Are you still learning?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, absolutely.   I'm still learning.   Sometimes you have to learn the hard way.   This course baits you so often and you just have to not take the bait.   And I think that it's kind of nice to learn‑‑ have those things happen, like obviously the 12th hole killed me this week, or this weekend.   I think if I take that hole out, I think I'm in contention.   So I was just 80 percent committed on the tee, not 100 percent committed, and I think that little difference there ended up costing me a lot this week.

Q.   What does the report card say for Justin Rose out of 10 this week? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   You know, it has to be a 4 out of 10 really in the end.   Saw many good things, but obviously result‑wise not one of my better results this year.   I had high hopes, and I feel like I'm sort of the type of player who should be able to gut it out a little bit better out there through experience, and I didn't do that this week, so it's disappointing.

Q.   Schedule the next few weeks?
JUSTIN ROSE:   I was going to play next week but I'm not playing now, and then I'm playing the Zurich Classic in New Orleans, and then THE PLAYERS Championship and then back for Wentworth.

Q.   You'll be looking forward to Wentworth?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it'll be good to get back and play in Europe and play at home, really, my home tournament.
