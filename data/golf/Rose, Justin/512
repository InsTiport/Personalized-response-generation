  Q. Justin, great run.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah. You know, I think that was going to be the nature of the day today. I knew 19. I had a feeling of 19 anyway, so it may prove to be the right number.   
 There were enough guys in it today, and on a beautiful day like we had, you know, it was obviously a lock jam, and it was a little bit like that today. I kept fighting, kept vacillating, and gave myself a putt at the last.   
 So you know, four rounds in the 60s.   
  
  Q. That's really all you can ask for in this game is to have a shot at it.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah. Exactly. I flagged that 7-iron at the last. I actually thought I had a lot of club. I took a little bit off it, and it was right at the pin. But I think I should have learned a little bit more from Mathias's putt, but obviously I had a little bit of adrenaline going. I didn't really feel like I wanted to hit that putt too hard, but possibly leave it short even though it was for a playoff.   
  
  Q. Out of the sun and into the shadows is always tough. I know you're headed off to Dubai. Good luck there. Congratulations on a great finish.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, thanks. I've enjoyed it. It's nice to play at home, and it's been great.   
  
  Q. See you next year.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Thanks, buddy.
