Q. Can you talk about how difficult the conditions were?
JUSTIN ROSE: I didn't think they were that difficult, to be honest with you. I was surprised at one point when I kept looking at the leaderboard and it was sort of 2‑under, 3‑under, 3‑under, it looked like that was a decent score. And then obviously a couple guys managed to get to 6. 
I felt like there was 6 out there today. Not the way I played, but I could see it out there, for sure. There's just enough moisture in the golf course, yeah, I thought it was playing nice. 
It was a little tricky, the wind got up a touch this afternoon, but nothing that you shouldn't really be able to handle with the golf shots.

Q. What's your assessment of where things got sideways for you?
JUSTIN ROSE: Drove it left the first few holes, hit a couple good putts early that didn't fall, and, yeah, from that point there's nothing really felt easy, I suppose. Never really found my rhythm.

Q. What's the mentality going into tomorrow?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, first things first, you want to make the cut, obviously, so get off to a good start. If I can get it back into the red for the Tournament tomorrow then you can build a weekend. I feel I can still get to 11‑ or 12‑under and which, you never know, I think this golf course offers a Sunday charge and there's a 64 out there, if you can hit the right shots at the right time. 
So I just got to give myself the opportunity if I do play a dream round I'm close enough.
