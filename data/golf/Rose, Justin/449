  JUSTIN ROSE:   Obviously he's a great player, five straight birdies, which must be tough to play against in you're rocky.   It was one of those days.   I hit some good shots early in my round, made one or two nice putts.   I got a couple of putting tips this week from Paul Mack (ph), changed a few things, changed putter, changed grip, changed stance and obviously worked which was nice. 
Obviously no guarantees, there's all sorts of things that can happen with Rocky playing Darren, and my match becomes more important.   I think the key is to play one shot at a time and that's the best thing to do in stroke play and match play ultimately.
It's really good to be back on The European Tour.   It's going to be an exciting year for me.     Winning at Doral has obviously given me a great chance to do well in The Race to Dubai and the FedExCup, so hopefully we can continue that and it's great to be back in these big tournaments.
