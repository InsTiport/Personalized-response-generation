 Q.  First time here in a couple of years, 2011, I believe.  What do you take away from this result today?  
JUSTIN ROSE: A lot of confidence, for sure.  I haven't played that much golf of late.  So it was nice to come out and just get a read on my game.  I think this was a great tournament to do it.  Perfect weather.  You really could understand where your game was this week.  I think there's a lot of positives for me and a lot of things to work on too.  Exactly what I wanted to do first week of the year, gauge where I'm at and it's nice to know that I'm not far away.   
I think I won the other competition this week, so take a little bit of credit from that because he's obviously incredibly hot right now.   
 Q.  What kind of mindset does this put you in?  I know you didn't win, but a great second place finish.  
JUSTIN ROSE: I'm not joking when I say I won the other tournament.  Coming down the stretch, we were playing for second.  I turned on and went through a couple of gears there.  Birdieing three of the last four to win second was exactly what the day was all about for me.  Take confidence in that, that I pulled out some good shots when I needed to.   
 Q.  20 under par, that's a good day's work, despite the fact that JT did the business?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I won the other tournament.  We all knew he was going to be hard to catch today.  We all needed help from him.  Had he had a bad day, I was there to pick up the pieces.  But that was never going to happen.  He's on cruise control right now.  Short game is great.  He's making midrange putts.   
From my point of view, really happy with the week.  It's a good way to come out, break off the rust and lots for me to build on.   
 Q.  Looked like there was a lot of control there, especially in the blistery companies out there?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Absolutely.  I felt pretty good with all my game except my iron play.  I felt like I could do a lot better from 120 to 160.  That's an area I can dial in a lot more coming up in the next few weeks.   
 Q.  Plans on the horizon for you?  
JUSTIN ROSE: A week's practice.  I'm going to stay out west.  I'm going to get a good week's work in and then San Diego from a couple of weeks.
