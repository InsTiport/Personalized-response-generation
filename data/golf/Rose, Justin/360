  JUSTIN ROSE:     The course showing somewhat of a fight out there.   I didn't really play‑‑ I drove the ball well.   Holed out quite well around the cups and didn't give away too much.   I've got a lot to work on, a lot to sharpen up on and a lot to improve ton and hopefully that will come as the week goes on. 

Q.   Big reception for Phil Mickelson behind you, is it fun to play along side him?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Good fun, for sure.   We had a good laugh out there.   Obviously Phil and Keegan are great friends, as we know, they play Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups together, so I just asked them to keep the high‑fives to a minimum out there today.   They are good guys and I enjoy playing with both of them.   Phil had a tough finish, and he's out signing autographs which shows who he is, but we had a good day as a group. 
It's always nice to be in the last group.   You want it on Sunday, but you get a nice reception on the 18th green, people stick around to see you finish, so enjoyed it.
