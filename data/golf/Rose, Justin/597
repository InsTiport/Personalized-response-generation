  Q.  Your work is not yet done;  a day for hanging on, wasn't it?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, it was an amazing leaderboard really.  I guess the guys the last couple of groups weren't really going anywhere which afforded the guys behind the luxury of not having to chase too hard.  But it was a tough day.  The course is playing much longer today and it was very difficult.   
  
  Q.  The key shots out there, the third into 18 was brave and almost inch perfect.   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  I had a good walk up to the green and I was trying to gauge whether Anders had made birdie or not, because I heard the kind of round of applause he got up there, so I figured he actually made 4.  So I knew I needed to make -- well, I needed to make 4 either way to win or get in the playoff.  It was a great yardage for a three-quarter pitching wedge which I could fly behind the hole.   
  
  Q.  Obviously a few swings, loosen up and gear yourself up for the 18th?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Very much so.  I think Anders and I -- he's a good guy and I'm sure we'll be both fighting pretty hard.   
 Such an exciting finishing, I knew I needed to play well and lucky I did.   
  
  Q.  How supportive was the crowd out there?  They would love to see an English champion.   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  They were great, wonderful reception the last hole.  It has been exciting playing in front of them all week.
