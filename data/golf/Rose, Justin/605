 Q.  Let's talk about your first round match. 
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, obviously I'm excited to have won and to have played so few holes, really, because the last five or six holes are a steady climb uphill to the clubhouse.  So my caddie was pleased with me for not making him climb up the hill. 

 Q.  What do you see for round two coming up, who you're playing?  Do you have a preference? 
 JUSTIN ROSE:  It's going to be a lefty one way or the other.  From what I saw of the game in front of me, it's day-to-day.  Any guy can light it up one particular day.  Obviously Phil plays fearless with one of those attitudes like you've got nothing to lose.  Richard is a very solid player, hits a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.  It'll be a tough game either way.
