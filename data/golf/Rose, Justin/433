Q.   Probably not quite the press conference you were expecting, but welcome back as defending champion.   Some opening comments?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, obviously whenever you get to come back and defend a tournament it's a great feeling.   I think it comes at a good time for start in the Playoffs, so hopefully I can ride some of the good memories that happened to me at this time last year.

Q.   Do you feel like the target is on your back, though, people chasing you for this tournament?
JUSTIN ROSE:   I mean, not particularly.   Obviously guys defend all the time.   There's always a defending champion, and I never think about that player.   Obviously we all go out and play the golf course, and I think this week more than any other we have to learn this Crooked Stick golf course.   Not many guys have played it before, so the real competitor is the golf course. 
For me it's just‑‑ as defending champion it's one of the things I enjoy, playing upon the good feelings.   You look around, there's posters of yourself out there.   There's a particularly nice one with Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Tom Watson and myself, so something I had a bit of fun with this week.

Q.   Early observations from some of the golfers is being able to hit the ball long will definitely help this week. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, absolutely.   I think the way is course is set up, the rain, that softened things, and that benefits the long hitter, and there's a few bunkers and a few corners that if you can carry the ball 300 yards, which there's not many guys in the field that can do that, but the few that can will have an advantage.   But they have an advantage pretty much every week. 
So it's about keeping the ball in play.   The rough is pretty thick.   You know, you think the greens are so good, as well, that it will suit pretty much anybody who has a good putting week.

Q.   Low scores this week? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I think low scores for sure.   Any time you give us soft greens, which they are obviously due to the weather, I think when you have soft greens certainly the first couple rounds, and the way things go in a tournament, how long, how difficult a golf course, if it's soft, guys tend to go low.
