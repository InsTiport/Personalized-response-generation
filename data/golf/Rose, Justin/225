JUSTIN ROSE: It's always tough when you try and win a tournament on Sundays, but I had a great week in Hong Kong.  It was fun and I played really, really well, obviously pushed me right to the end and we separated from the field a little bit so that was fun to have that head-to-head shootout.  Always nice to pick up a win late in the season and pick up some points, and obviously give myself a better shot at The Race to Dubai.
Q. You obviously worked at home; are you changing anything in your swing?
JUSTIN ROSE: Not really.  I feel very good about my game.  To be honest with you, getting back from Hong Kong it was more relax and recharge the batteries before a bit of traveling and one final sort of last-ditch effort to try and overtake Rory and Danny and a couple of the other guys ahead of me.  Really keeping my eye on some stuff.  Sean Foley flew over and we spent a few hours working on some stuff, but nothing changing at this point.
Q. You finished fourth last year; so this course suits you all right?
JUSTIN ROSE: Last year was an interesting tournament for me.  I was, I forget exactly the numbers but I was 4-over through the first seven holes of the tournament and went on a tear from there and it was 27-under for the next X amount of holes and Sunday got pretty tricky.  I think I bogeyed the last to miss a playoff.
Hopefully it's a course that does suit my eye and it's a course that you have to drive the ball well on and distance definitely helps around here.  So I have to drive it well.
Q. Any key holes?
JUSTIN ROSE: The closing stretch is obviously tricky, 17 and 18 typically play into the prevailing wind from what I remember, and obviously caused some trouble last year for a lot of guys coming down the stretch.  Finishing the round strong, played the par 5s well and I think that helps build a good score around here.
Q. Coming into the event, you're fifth in The Race to Dubai, so a key week?
JUSTIN ROSE: I'm about 800,000 behind Rory and Danny, so for me, that's a win; if I win any of the last two events or either of the last two events, that puts me ahead of them.  Obviously depending on what they do.  For me it's fairly simple imagines:  I need to play well the next two weeks.
