 Q.  You come up a little bit short, but seemed like a good week all in all.  What do you take away from this week?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, absolutely.  I didn't have my best game this week.  Kind of got a little found out today.  Got trickier.  The wind blew this afternoon, and you need to have a bit more control of your golf ball.   
I just too many shots out of the rough.  The putts seemed to slide by the edge today.  Yeah, I think I hit seven fairways in the last two days, so didn't really have my best stuff.   
All in all really enjoyed the week.  It was fun to be here.  Good little golf course.  Obviously starting the day I had high hopes we could pull off a good win.  At the same time, you got to look at it realistic today, and think -- you know, for the most part, did pretty well to give myself a chance.   
 Q.  Yes, and you have a few events left.  What are your thoughts for the last events?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Finish strong.  You know, I play Hong Kong next week and then Dubai.  I would love to finish the Race to Dubai on the European Tour strong.  That's a course I've always done well at.   
Be great to lift another bit of silverware heading into Christmas.  My sights are firmly set.  I'll be here next year.  Looking forward to it.
