 Q. Just talk about how pleased you are with today's round?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I'm pleased with it. I saw some signs of better putting. I think today I made some really good putts, I felt more comfortable on the greens. I freed up my stroke a little bit. That was good.   
I still made a couple of mistakes here and there, but it was kind of where it was tough not to make mistakes. It was fairly breezy out there. It was fairly low humidity throughout the day. The greens got pretty crusty. Still not going to be easy for the leaders this afternoon. It's 4 o'clock, it feels like it's afternoon already.   
But it was a good round. Kind of kept me in the hunt. I felt like it would be a good, positive day. I started the day 6 back, and if I'm less than 6 back at the end of this, then I think it's a good, positive day.   
   
 Q. Seems like right now you're kind of under the radar, but you're right there, you're in the thick of it?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, absolutely. I think the last couple of years I've played good Saturdays to get into the final group. And tomorrow is moving day for that purpose. And hopefully I can come out tomorrow strong, and put myself right in there on Sunday.  
   
 Q. Let's talk about the leaderboard. It seems like it's stacked with so many people right now. How exciting is that going forward?  
JUSTIN ROSE: There's great players, looks like all over that leaderboard. Charley Hoffman pops up every single year, it feels like. There's quite a few on that leaderboard. It's the Masters, and we try to get our games peaking coming in here, and it's good to see that a lot of guys are able to do that.  
   
 Q. How important was 13?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, that was important. 12 was an unfortunate. It was the only disappointing bogey I felt today. 11 you've almost got to expect bogey and move on, holed a bunker shot on 10. So I saw myself playing 10 and 11 in 8. So I brushed off the bogey pretty quickly up. 12 was annoying, but birdieing both the parâ€‘5s after that.
