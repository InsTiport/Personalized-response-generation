Q.   That was an incredible round of golf to watch.   Describe what it was like to play. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, that was a lot of fun, absolutely.   The front nine was just as good as the back nine, and the back nine putts started going in, which is a nice feeling. Just started to get refocussed but obviously I knew I was playing my way into the tournament; more than into the tournament but into the lead. 
It was just important for me to keep positive, as well, to keep aggressive, even though when you're sort of four or five holes ahead of the boys behind, there are a lot of birdie opportunities out there. 
So even though I've hit the lead I was trying to tell myself it wasn't necessarily the lead and I had to play aggressively coming in.

Q.   The putt at the last was incredible.   Talk us through it from your point of view. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Well, I knew it was hero or zero there.   I was one roll away from looking like an idiot but I knew that was the kind of put it was.   I was just trying to putt to a point on the hill and let gravity take its course. 
As it got to the top of the hill and it was clear it was going to topple over, I knew it was perfect, and I actually got goosebumps, I thought it was going to go in for a second.   It was a really nice way to finish, and I was quite happy just to have a two‑inch tap‑in. 

Q.   You posted 21‑under, how do you rate its chances? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I thought it was going to be good to be honest.   I caught a glimpse of the board walking to the 18th tee, I saw Rory had gone birdie, birdie and he's putting the squeeze on. 
But I knew that that's what Rory does.   If you watch the pay Peter Hanson won at the BMW Masters in Shanghai, Rory pushed him all the way to the end making late birdies.   And I kind of figured the same thing might happen here. 
He has a par 5 to play and 18 is no gimmie by any chance, but 16, 17, not easy holes, but, hey, it's one birdie for a playoff.   And what can I say, I just have to wait and see.

Q.   Was that final round of golf as much fun as it was impressive to watch?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it certainly was.   I mean, I've been seeing a lot of 60s and 10‑unders and 12‑unders of late, and I've not been able to quite get going low, and all week, I've been sort of semi‑frustrated with my putting and with my game, and I've been playing better than my scores reflected and I just kept believing that maybe some day it will happen for me and that's exactly what happened today.

Q.   There's not much more you can do on the final day, that last putt seemed to me actually even better than your holed put on 17 at The Ryder Cup; how was that?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Well, if I go onto win the tournament, yeah, I'll reflect on that as a great, great, great putt.   But I don't think anything can quite compare to 17 at The Ryder Cup just yet. 
But again, that putt, I drew that perfectly and it was one of those moments where you're lucky enough to let the ball fall perfectly over the hill.   I did get goosebumps when it was halfway down the hill and I thought it may even go in. 

Q.   What are you expecting waiting for Rory to finish? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I'm going to expect a playoff.   That's what I have to prepare for mentally now.   Anything else will be a bonus, unless he makes two birdies and then, hey, every credit to him.   We'll have to wait and see.
