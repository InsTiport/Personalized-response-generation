Q.   Justin, that was a pretty tight match.   How do you feel to come through it? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I'm very happy to come through that match.   It wasn't a classic, but it doesn't need to be.   It's all about doing enough on the day to get the match won.   I kind of kept saying to myself I've got all day to beat him, and that's way it turned out.

Q.   You were one down through ten holes.   You made eagle at 11.   Was that the turning point?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it sure was.   9 was a bad green for me.   Scott had a good chance to win the hole.   He led me and I missed a fiveâ€‘footer for the halve.   That was a tough momentum swing there, I felt. 
To come back from that with an eagle on 11 and birdie at 12 really put me in charge of the match and made me feel good in my game again. 
Scott did well again to really hang in there. 
I got a lucky break actually on 15, hit it to the right bushes but had a clearing, managed to make par. 
And then Scott holed two good putts, 16 and 17, to really keep it interesting, I suppose.

Q.   Does it feel like it will get better round by round if you can keep beating people? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, definitely.   I still felt a little nervous out there, a little edgy.   I think it's not having been in a competitive environment for about three months, I suppose.   I felt like I dealt with those emotions well today.   I feel like it will get easier as the week goes on.
