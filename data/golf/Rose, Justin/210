Q. I had a flashback to Cog Hill, 17th hole where you chipped in.  I understand that this was 50 yards instead of off the green.  You have a marvelous touch around the green?
JUSTIN ROSE: Thanks, I appreciate it.  But the funny thing is my short game is letting me down.  My touch wasn't good.  I just really bullied myself into hitting a good one on 18.  I asked myself a lot of questions and hit a great shot.  It was nice to finish that way.  I'm all for rest.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: It was terrible.  Almost a terrible match.  Starting out, it was bogeys flying everywhere.  I think he might have bogeyed the first five, I bogeyed the first three.  And then birdied 4 and 5.  I actually played pretty nicely through the middle and got myself 4-up and was cruising from there.  It's funny how match play, you lose one or two holes and you were cruising and then you start to think about the results.  The last couple of holes were just about really getting it done.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: It's a fun little golf course.  It's hard to get a gauge on it with how heavy the wind is.  You can drive the ball maybe close to 400 yards on a couple of holes.  It makes it very interesting.  Strategy is really important around here.  I believe on Friday the wind might switch completely the direction, and blow just as hard.  It's going to be a continual learning process this week.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, a hundred percent.  That's what we need.  It doesn't matter if you win 7-6 or 1-up, it's a point on the board.
