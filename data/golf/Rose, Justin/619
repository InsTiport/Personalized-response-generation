JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, nice way to finish.  Kind of ironic way to finish, really.  It was only the second green I missed all day.  I played really, really well, gave myself hundreds of birdie chances in 18 holes, if that's possible.  And putted well, just burned the edge all day long.

All of a sudden looking at finishing with a bogey to shoot even after playing so well, and to pitch in was kind of, I think, my reward for staying patient, really, because I stayed really patient out there today.  It would have been easy to get frustrated by not taking my chances, but the fact that I was hitting good putts and not going in, I can live with that, the fact that I was striking the putter solid.
Q.  Talk about how your form it at the moment?
JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, it's right there.  I'm playing well enough to be right up there in this tournament.  Scores will come with that.  I think I'm playing every bit as good as I have ever, just have to get that confidence level and a little bit of luck and good momentum, really, and I'll have some good results.
Q.  Have you made some changes?
JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, exactly.  I would say I've simplified a few things rather than made changes.  I've sort of tried to really just see the game for what it is, which is a simple game, just get the ball in the hole in as few shots as possible, work a little bit more on my short game.  Yeah, I feel like    I missed one or two fairways today, as well, but the long game is right there.
