  Q. Your thoughts on Colin Montgomerie leading the squad in Wales.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I think we always knew Colin was going to be a captain. He's had an incredible career obviously ask and Ryder Cup has often brought out the best in him.   
 I thought in my mind it would be Scotland in 2014, but I guess once you get given the chance, you may as well take it for sure. I always knew he would be captain at some stage, and why not now? He's certainly in with all of the players and his face will still be around a lot, so I think he will be really effective in terms of a wildcard situation and the form of the players running into it.
