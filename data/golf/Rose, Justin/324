 Q. Good round yesterday to get yourself into the mix.  Talk about the plans for today.JUSTIN ROSE: Obviously good opportunity today I would say.  Obviously there's a lot of good players around the lead and it's pretty condensed.  I think anyone 3-under or better has a great chance today.  Patrick has proven to be a pretty good winner but if I can go out and put some pressure on him, it's always nice to be a couple of groups ahead and ask the question.  And so for me, go out and play a good round of golf and that's what I'm focusing on.
Q. Hopping on a plane tonight?JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, exactly.  Taking the family back to the U.K. for a few weeks and playing The Scottish Open and Open Championship.  Yeah, it's a good run for me.  It's a nice summer.
