 Q.  Talk about birdieing the last three on what was a trying day for you?  
JUSTIN ROSE: I think that was a nice reward for staying patient.  Could have been easy to get frustrated out there.  Nothing was sort of feeling that easy up until the last few holes, but I felt like yesterday, I walked off the course frustrated after giving a couple away coming in, and then today, I didn't want to sort of be the same guy.   
So I was doing my best to stay patient.  At some point, even the cut line was more in my thoughts.  I had about an 8-footer to stay 2-under.  That putt I made at 15 really obviously settled me down the last few holes.   
But anyway, point is, I got rewarded for the patience today, as I didn't do yesterday.   
 Q.  Driving the ball superbly and you were standing in the middle of the fairway with mid to short irons in all day.  Struggling with the short irons or mid-irons?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I think for sure, I think this season, I'm really encouraged with a lot of aspects of my game.  Driving the ball really, really well.  Short game and putting have been really good, as well.  So my strength is normally my iron play.  So hopefully that will click into gear soon.  But the swing at the last there was the best swing I made on an iron some quite some time.  I definitely feel like I'm clicking into something.   
 Q.  Positive vibes head?
