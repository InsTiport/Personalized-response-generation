Q. I know you are disappointed.  You played hard.  Looks like a Top-10 finish.  Just wrap up your feelings as you exit this event.
JUSTIN ROSE: Obviously had a shot today.  I kind of knew that.  It was so bunched.  Obviously there was so many guys on the lead and close to the lead that someone had to play great golf today.  I could see that there were some scores to be had out there.
Once again, it was very similar to yesterday where someone from the middle of the pack really came through with the softer conditions.  I knew that was going to be the case as well.  That was definitely the nature of the golf course this week.  It was harder to hang on than it was to play from the middle.
My start, obviously I doubled No. 4 and bogeyed 5 and that really put me behind the eight ball.  But never really gave up.  I set myself a goal of getting back to 1 over and really believed I could do it.  I played great golf, to be honest with you, from the 6th hole in.  I had nine putts today that I felt were really good chances.  So the putts just didn't fall today.  I never stopped believing.  So even as late as when I birdied 12, I still felt like I could post a number.
Q. Tommy is going to finish runner-up this week.  What about his mentality will make him a major champion?
JUSTIN ROSE: Definitely.  He's got a wonderful game.  I love the way he hits the golf ball.  There's things I emulate when I watch him play.  I love the way he compresses it, strikes it.  But more so, he's got great temperament and I think that will stand in good stead.
