 Q. Talk about today's round and how it provides some momentum for you. 
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously today I'm ecstatic with that round of golf. 3-under par in those conditions was more than I could have hoped for. I know Ben Curtis shot 3-under too but the average score today is going to be very, very high and guys are going to have a hard time this afternoon so I'm glad to be done.

 Q. Mentally what do you do from last night to today to get yourself prepared having 18 competitive holes behind you yesterday?
 JUSTIN ROSE: There wasn't a lot of time. I finished golf like the last group to get done last night which was nice. I didn't have to come whack back to restart and we finished our round early this morning. So it was good to get done last night but it was just a quick dinner and sleep. 
 Sometimes you don't even get that much restful sleep when you know you got to get up in six hours time. So actually I didn't do anything. I didn't have time to think. I just wanted to keep it going but sometimes if you play well the first day, which is not really what I did do, but sometimes the later tee is a good tee time to have because you can keep the momentum going and keep performing like you had been. 

 Q. Is the course getting out of control?
 JUSTIN ROSE: I don't know about out of control, it's about as tough as you could ever want to play it. I know that. But I haven't seen any balls moving on the greens or the ball moving around the -- in terms of out of control, it's not close to that. So it's going to firm up and get hard and fast very quickly with this wind.
