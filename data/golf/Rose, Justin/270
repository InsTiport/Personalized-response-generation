JUSTIN ROSE:   Yes, feeling fine.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about your round today.   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Good match with Ryan.   Obviously Ryan is a quality player.   I got up a couple of times, 2‑up, and he came fighting back both times.   
We played really nicely on the front.   Left a few out there.   Quality golf was really good on the front nine.  
But then the marine layer rolled in, and the course began to feel a lot more difficult, for whatever reason.   Ryan made a couple of mistakes on the back nine and then I got a bit lucky on 16.   He had a good tee shot that actually came up in the bunker and I missed it way right.   Scrambled up and down, he didn't get up and down out of the trap.   That gave me 2‑up and 2 to play.   And up and down through the back of 17 to close it out.  
A couple of good up‑and‑downs really to close out the match.
