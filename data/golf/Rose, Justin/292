Q.   Thoughts on the 7‑under today? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Much needed, obviously the leaderboard lit up today.   Looked out the window this morning, it was looking pretty grim out there but obviously we got lucky.   To play without a drop of rain, was not what I thought the day would be like. 
The guys took advantage of the scoring conditions, there wasn't much breeze about.   Long hitters like Nicolas Colsaerts could take on the par 5s. 
Basically my 7‑under was needed to just to keep somewhat of a pace.   Played well.   Had the opportunity to go quite a few lower, too. 

Q.   There was a nice bounceback‑ability about the first day but what was the difference between today and yesterday?
JUSTIN ROSE:   I think just got into a nice rhythm today.   Hit my mid‑irons much better.   Focused on that on the range yesterday.   I drove the ball really well yesterday and hit my wedges well but today I hit my mid‑irons well. 
I basically had a birdie chance on every shot I hit towards the pin today.   That was encouraging.   Just felt like I had a couple left‑to‑righters I missed on the low side and Fooch gave me a little thought on the 17 and made a left‑to‑righter there. 
The only lapse, I felt just concentration‑wise, I felt like it was a long day.   I don't know if it's just because it felt dark out there.   I felt like it was late.   Doesn't feel like 3:30 to me.   Felt like I struggled with my concentration a bit and made a bad mistake on 15 and second shot on 16 and luckily got that one up‑and‑down and birdied 17 and made myself feel like it's a good day's work.

Q.   Despite what you're saying about the leader, do you feel back in the competition now?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I need two more low ones, for sure, but absolutely still in it.
