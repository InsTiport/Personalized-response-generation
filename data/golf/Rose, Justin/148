JUSTIN ROSE: Not really a ton to take away.  It was kind of just a little -- I felt actually the first six or seven holes on Thursday I felt like I had -- I felt good.  I got off to a good start.  I felt like I was where I wanted to be, and then I played a bad back nine on Thursday, and it kind of never really got going again from that point on.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Not really.  It would be a dream to win here, but this course doesn't owe me anything, right?  That was 19 years ago.  You don't expect to play well here because of what happened 19 years ago, there's no doubt about that.
So it's frustrating to not play well from the start but not because of what happened in '98.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: I think all the guys respect this golf course.  Everyone thinks it's one of the best ones we play on the rotation.  I think it's fair.  In the breeze it plays well, especially the way it's set up this year.  You can be a little bit off line in the right areas of the golf course and still have a shot to the green.  And that makes it a shot-maker's golf course, and this year obviously more of a putting competition from that point of view, because it was less penal off the tee than some of The Open Championships.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I played Quail last year, and I felt I should have won there; I finished third.  Played pretty well.  It's a course that suits my eye again.  Just have got to drive it better than I have been, it's definitely a golf course you need to drive the ball a well.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, the first six or seven holes, for sure.  So don't really know too much about the changes yet, but I'm sure it'll look and smell like the same golf course.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: No, I drove it terribly at the Irish Open, as well.  I'm definitely -- I'm making a few changes with my swing right now, just to alleviate some back pressure and stuff like that.  I've lengthened it, loosened up a little bit.  It's a reconfiguration at times, and I'm trying to resync things up.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I mean that's another good one, for sure.  It's another one I would regard as fair.  I think one year the setup got away from them, in '99 it was a bit too tough.  But for the most part it's another great golf course, and would be one I would look forward to.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I think when you're on, you're on, though.  When you're on, you stay focused when you're in the lead.  Sometimes if you're in the right mindset it doesn't prove to be any harder at times.  It's a rare place to be.  It's not easy.  But if you do get into the right mindset, you feel comfortable with the lead, if you're on your game -- then it's all about if you're on your game.  It's never nice to sleep on the lead if you have something nagging at you that you're not sure how tomorrow is going to go because of something.  Generally if you're playing well, you feel good about your game and you're very confident.
