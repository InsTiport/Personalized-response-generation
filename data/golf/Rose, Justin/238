Q. Assess your round and then, of course, another great season on TOUR.  How do you summarize it?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously, it's a season I can look back at really positively.  It was nice to cap it off with a strong Sunday.
I felt very good on the front nine.  Played a really, really strong front nine and other than the lapse on the 10th, played beautiful golf today.
Even in the middle of the back nine, I still believed I could win the tournament.  I felt very good.  I felt like I could birdie every hole coming in.  I knew that it was going to take something like that.
But I really felt like I could put the pressure on coming down the stretch.
Even playing 16 I felt like if I birdied the last three that's obviously -- they all were birdies.
I had wedge into 16.
17, you got to hit a good tee shot, failed to do that, which made it tough.
And then the front pin on 18's a birdie hole.
So, I kind of felt confident, positive.  But all in all, whatever it's going to be, top-5 finish here let's say.  It's another strong showing at East Lake.  I really enjoy this golf course, maybe coming in here next year in the top-5 and hopefully get a chance to win this one.
Q. How do you take this round here and kind of build momentum as you finish up your year going back home to the European Tour and everything?
JUSTIN ROSE: There's a lot for me to be positive about.  I feel like I made some subtle changes to my routine this week.  Not just my putting, but my long game and just how I'm sort of visualizing things.  To have a strong week with something new, I think, it always very encouraging.
I think that if I look back at how I played in the Majors this year, I think that's something I can build on.  And the only thing I could say more of is, obviously, just to win a bit more regularly.  But I felt like after the Florida swing I played some really good golf.
