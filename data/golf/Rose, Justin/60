Q. Can you talk about today starting off with the fog and then some rain and how your game was today?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously I think everyone's raring to go.  Obviously for me it's the first round of 2019, it's kind of like you're at the starting line and they kept dragging it back 30 minutes with the fog.  So that was tricky just to keep warm really and keep loose.  But once I got going I felt like I played really well.  Starting out I felt like I could have been 4- or 5- or 6-under par through the first seven holes.  So I left a few out there early in my round and a couple silly mistakes here and there, didn't capitalize on some short birdie putts.  But birdieing my last three to get it to 4-under kind of made me feel good about kind of getting something out of the round.  And all in all, with the new bag of clubs, I felt really good with them.  I drove the ball fantastically well today and hit a lot of shots pin high with my irons.  So from that point of view a lot of things to feel good about.
Q. Going into tomorrow how do you feel, what do you think you might do to change up your game?
JUSTIN ROSE: Listen, I think this is a golf course or a golf tournament you need to stay in an aggressive mindset.  You got to play -- you got to make a lot of birdies to do well here.  There's going to be guys, many many guys sort of 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-under par after the first day, so 4-under par I feel like is good enough where you don't have to panic but you have to put your foot down on the accelerator.
