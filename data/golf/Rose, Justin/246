 Q.  Finishing up on 17, how badly did you want to get it done and get that third round or second round in?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously, I opened my big mouth to the boys playing with us, the boys, I said, the end is in sight, and 30 seconds later they blew the horn.  So my name is mud all over here.   
But, yeah, it would have been -- obviously, at the time I didn't think that we wouldn't finish for the day.  I thought that obviously the storm would blow through maybe an hour and then go.  But obviously now calling it for the day now is a bit of a drag, because it means we'll come out at 5:00 a.m. and play one hole and then probably, providing I play a good golf hole, probably play around 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  So that's quite a big window to try to fill.  Do I go back to sleep?  Go chill?  So that's going to be interesting to deal with that tomorrow.  But I'm in good position.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it was a bit of a roller coaster really.  Nice birdie on 1.  And No. 2, I hit it left and off the tee, hit it left off the tee and had to wait like five or six minutes for a ruling, took forever, which kind of unsettled the whole group really and ended up making a nice par there and actually birdied the next.   
But then made a slack double on No. 4.  I hit two great shots into the par-5 5th, but failed to make birdie.  So I felt again like another bogey on the 5th.   
So the birdie I made on No. 6, I hit a great tee shot, had 12 feet for eagle there and kind of righted the ship.   
Then I birdied the 7th.  So it kind of felt very up-and-down for the first seven holes.   
Then I fell into a nice rhythm, started playing well, and the only other bogey I made was on No. 15, really two great shots and actually landed the ball right by the pin.  Rolled through the back and made bogey.  But other than that, I'm making a lot of birdies which I think you need to do and putting much better.  So excited for the weekend.   
 Q.  Are you surprised that conditions were maybe as easy, maybe the scoring was a little easier than you anticipated in the afternoon?  Because yesterday afternoon there weren't a lot of scores out there.  Seems like today the course could be had?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Other than this little blip, this storm, we have had the best end of the draw, for sure.  I looked at the weather actually on Wednesday and it appeared that we might have the best end of the draw.  I knew it was going to get windy on Thursday afternoon and then it appeared like the long range forecast meant that it wasn't going to pick up on Friday afternoon, and that was the case.  So I would definitely say we had it a shot or two easier on our side of the draw, which is reflected in the scores.  Yeah, obviously this is the only little downside to it to our side of the draw.   
 Q.  Nice to sneak the birdie in there before the horn.  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it was nice, I was pretty mad walking off 15.  I birdied 16 and 17.  I was pretty mad walking off 15.  I made two nice swings on 15 and walking off with bogey there wasn't the best.   
I missed the fairway at 16, the par-5.  And I kind of felt like I lost a bit of momentum that I had.  So actually to birdie 16 and then 17 was such a great way to end the day.   
 Q.  Nice to go to sleep on that, isn't it?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Absolutely.  Keeping pace, you know, you got Jason and a couple guys on 9-under, I think, and they're a couple holes behind me.  So you almost feel like it's -- we'll see what the weather is like in the morning, but it should be pretty good, I would imagine, early.   
 Q.  Obviously not quite the halfway stage, but you're in a good position probably?  
JUSTIN ROSE: A hundred percent.  Exactly where I need to be.  Keeping pace with the leaders, top-10 in the pack, but absolutely I'm happy where I'm at.   
 Q.  What do you anticipate tomorrow afternoon if the weather cooperates, what conditions do you think you'll face tomorrow?  
JUSTIN ROSE: The course is beginning to firm up and actually played really nice.  It was so wet on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, even Thursday morning, but it was beginning to really play good.  It's a real shame that this rain is going to soften it up again, which will keep the scoring scorable.   
I think you'll still see some birdies tomorrow afternoon.  So continue to make birdies, continue to go low I think is going to be the rule.
