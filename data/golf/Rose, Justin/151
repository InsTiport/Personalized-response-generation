JUSTIN ROSE: It was a nice enjoyable day out there, for sure.  I played pretty well, actually.  I played really well.  I had the opportunity to score low, just couldn't make putts.  That's what you need to do out there today.  You're going to create plenty of birdie chances, if you hit your irons crisply; the greens were receptive.   
Pin placements were good today.  You had to hit good shots to get close.  They tucked them a little bit more than the last couple of days, based upon low wind speeds.  But it was there for the taking today.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: You know, 69, that's not going to do me any favours today.  I think the mid 60s or low 60s there if you played well.  You have to make putts to shoot low scores, and that was the only thing missing today.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, double figures, for sure.  10, 11, 12.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, obviously the man out front has a good track record.  If he keeps putting well, he hasn't hit it probably as he would like the first couple of days.  But it's hard to find your rhythm and your full game in those tough conditions the first two rounds.  He's obviously done all the right things to score well, which is what you have to do on windy links.  He'll probably find his rhythm a bit more out there today.  The greens have obviously been receptive.  I imagine he's going to have plenty of birdie chances.  The way he's putting, he's going to make some birdies today.  So the chasing pack will have to chase pretty hard.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it was brilliant being out there with Tommy, as well.  Obviously a local hero.  Big crowds, obviously, first, second group out, really.  The place was packed from the word go.  Even looking down the first hole it was four or five deep.  I don't think I've played in crowds that deep since the Ryder Cup.  So really good fun.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JUSTIN ROSE: It's so tough to say now without the leaders having teed off.  Obviously anyone who tees off today, like Adam, like 3-over, for example, if he tees off, if he posts something in the mid 60s, then he's going to be a couple under, and if he has a great Sunday, he has an outside chance.  All guys teeing off from 3-over need to post something definitely mid to low 60s today.
