 Q.  You were stuck on par for a long time today through 12, but then you really got it going at the end, four birdies the last six.  Your thoughts on how it went out there today?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, that was very much the way that the round played out.  I actually started out the first three or four holes playing pretty well and giving myself some birdie opportunities, but just didn't make any and followed it up with a bogey on 5.  Being 1-over through 7, you felt like it was not the start you were looking for.   
Stayed patient.  Made a little note in my yardage book after 12 holes about finishing strong and was able to do that.   
 Q.  You are still in the rear-view mirror of Justin Thomas.  He has not really pulled away.  Your thoughts on what might happen tomorrow?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Well, yeah, we need some help from him.  But also, what is he, 21 with seven?  It offers us that glimmer of home.  A great round of golf, we've seen guys go pretty deep this week, 10-, 11-under par rounds, and that's the kind of something it might take tomorrow.   
But there's always the opportunity.  He's obviously playing with a lot of confidence, a lot of momentum.  He's a great guy, so it's hard not to pull for him.  But at the same time tomorrow, we're going to need a little help.
