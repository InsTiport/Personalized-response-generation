  Q. You've been here before. How would you assess your round?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Well, obviously delighted about the round, delighted that I turned it around. I got off to a shaky start, didn't feel that comfortable out there on the course, and I guess I made a great swing into 6, hit it five or six feet. From the tee it looked like I was close. Then I went up there and it was a little farther than I would have liked. I hadn't putted well the first few holes, but making that slippery little putt settled me down.  
  
  Q. How do you make the journey from here, first, second round, to Sunday?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: You just do it through being patient, you play shot for shot, you stay in the moment. That's so easy to say; it's harder to do it. I guess that's what I've learned. I think I feel more comfortable on the leaderboard now, and I'll probably get away from the golf in my mind tonight and early tomorrow morning and I'll come back here and try and do the same thing.  
  
  Q. How did you feel last year in contention on Sunday?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: I think I learned that I just felt like I belonged there, that I enjoyed it, that I felt comfortable with it. Yeah, ultimately enjoying it was the biggest -- not surprise, but the thing that I felt the best about. I wasn't particularly nervous. Obviously it's the Masters, you're nervous, of course, but I was just really enjoying the challenge there.  
  
  Q. In the States there might not be people familiar with what you endured right after you turned pro. How would you summarize that and what you learned from it?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Obviously I learned pro with a wave of expectation on my shoulders when I was 17, especially after doing so well at Birkdale. Ultimately I guess I wasn't ready, but I put my head down and stayed with it, and that's what I learned from it. You can't count your chickens too early, before they're hatched, in this game, and I've got to work hard. That's what pays off.  
  
  Q. What kick-started your round in your head after the two bogeys?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Like I said, I think just that great shot I hit into 6 and I had a slippery little putt. I wasn't putting particularly well, but I made a great little putt there in the middle of the hole and that settled me down.  
  
  Q. What, if anything, do you have to prove to yourself on this stage?   
 JUSTIN ROSE: You know, that's the thing. I don't have to prove anything to myself. I think I know that my game is in good shape. I know I have all the tools I need, it's just a matter of going out and doing it. That's the thing that's easier said than done.   
 Right now it's the first round. There's a whole bunch of players playing well. It's one or two shots that we're talking about in 54 holes. Being in the lead on day one, it really means nothing. It's a great start. Obviously you can't win the tournament the first day, you can only lose it. I haven't lost it, so it's a great day.
