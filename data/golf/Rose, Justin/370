 Q.   3‑under 68 in round two, is that a good 68 or a questionable 68?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   It's a good 68.   Starting out this morning, we had four holes to play.   The damage was done going down 15 late last night.   I hit it in the edge much the bunker in the fescue and had to start the day struggling to save par.   
18 was just a bear this morning.   Made bogey there, too.   But made birdie on 16 to I felt like even the card a little bit.   But at this stage of the tournament, 6‑under, a few off the lead, somewhere in contention is a good place to be.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you guys got the good end of the draw or the bad end of the draw?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   I thought it was going to be the good end of the draw but I would have to say the hard end of the draw right now.   This wind is making it really tough out there.   The humidity has dropped.   The greens are rolling about, I don't know, a foot and a half quicker than they were yesterday.   The pin placements become tricky when you see them with extra speed.   You're having to be very defensive with your putts out there, so I felt like mind‑set changed out there this morning, rather than making birdies, it was about hanging on.  
   
 Q.   What was the plan going into this afternoon's round?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Just more of the same.   This course can be tricky and I think a lot of guys are in the mind‑set of making birdies.   
But with some added wind out there and the greens quickening up, you have to be a little more defensive with your iron play and put the ball in the right spot.   And yeah, I think maybe you'll see scoring level out.   Obviously need a good solid round to give yourself a chance on Sunday.
