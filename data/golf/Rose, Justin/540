 Q. (Inaudible.)
 JUSTIN ROSE: I made a great par on 8, so 2-over through 7. Way out of position on 8, looking at going 3-over and it just looked like it was going to be a long day. 
 But made a great up-and-down on 8, parred 9, birdied 10, and really got myself going. 
 And I hit great shot at 17 to try to get under par for the day, just missed the putt. 
 Obviously, I bogeyed 18, but it turned out to be a good bogey. I hit a poor tee shot. 

 Q. Ryder Cup line, you're comfortable inside that top-10, what are your plans for the next three weeks?
 JUSTIN ROSE: I don't know, that's a great question. I entered the Dutch Open and the PGA, but I would rather -- my plan was to play the FedExCup, but I don't know if I have quite enough point to be safe. 
 So I might have to go back and earn some more.
