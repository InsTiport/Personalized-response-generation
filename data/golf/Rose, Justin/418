JUSTIN ROSE:   We are in shock.   We wanted to believe, we really did want to believe but we had no illusions of how hard that day was going to be, four shots against a team that's played so well all week. 
IAN POULTER:   Ollie said to us at the start of the week, Ryder Cup is what memories and dreams are made of, and he's been awesome.   And last night in that team room was buzzing.   We weren't 4‑down.   We was not 4‑down.   We was all‑square.   And we just knew we had a chance and do you know what, this is history right here.   This has been unbelievable. 

Q.   Can you truly believe this is happening? 
IAN POULTER:   No.   But I tell you what, I'm going to enjoy it, with the best team I've ever seen, and the best captain I've ever seen, and everyone else, because this right here is special.
