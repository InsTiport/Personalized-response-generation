  Q. Really good round of golf out there today.  Not that many low scores.  4-under par, 68.  I thought the putting was really good for you out there today.
 JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, for sure.  The greens kind of got that little dicey look a little bit late in the day as well.  You felt like the ball wasn't rolling, it was more like it was skating.  So, yeah, definitely was very happy with my speed.  That's what I worked on after yesterday's round.  And, yeah, putted the ball well.
 I think I had to rely upon that.  I think today really the key was game plan, strategy, patience and good putting.  Obviously I felt like I didn't hit enough fairways today, so that's something to try to pick up on the weekend.
 Q. I know at the end of last year you started, you went back to Sean Foley you guys started working together.  How has that process been and it looks like you're starting to see some results from that?
 JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, obviously Foles is my boy, I've seen him -- listen, I had the best part of my career working under Sean, so -- I blame COVID.  I was kind of locked down there in the Bahamas and just sort of went in a weird direction there for awhile.
 Good to be back.  Yeah, exactly, listen, he knows how I've played well and why I've played well and we haven't had a lot of time together yet.  So this week's been great.  Obviously he lives here in Orlando, so I had a chance to see him a little bit and I have a little bit clearer understanding now of exactly how much I need to exaggerate some of the moves I've been working on.
 Q. You and your family have lived in Orlando for awhile, obviously it's been a strange year.  Almost a year ago.  We got fans back on the golf course.  What's it like to have the fans back out there?
 JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, that was a treat, to be honest with you.  It was great to be in a big group.  Obviously playing with Jordan and Bryson -- obviously Rory in front of us as well -- it was kind of all the fans were condensed to pretty much those two groups on the back nine today and it felt amazing, I got to say.  It kind of focused my mind a little bit and, yeah, I really, really, really, really enjoyed it.
