JUSTIN ROSE: Today was a good day of links golf.  Felt like three or four seasons out there.  The jacket was on and off.  There was enough wind to keep it tricky, but also not enough -- it was calm enough where you could play with the wind.  You could hit good golf shots.   
For me, 10- or 15-mile-an-hour wind or whatever it was today is a perfect amount of wind on a links course.  It separates the guys who are playing well and the guys who aren't.  It doesn't make it just about a putting competition.  Yet it's playable.   
 Q.  Lee Westwood saying we might have the best of it today.  Do you think that is a fair reflection?  
JUSTIN ROSE: I'm not really sure how it was this morning.  I watched golf this morning, a lot of guys were making birdies.  I think there was a period around midday it rained quite a bit.  Maybe guys who were off in that little kind of -- around midday time probably had the worst of it.   
Certainly the last six holes of our round were gorgeous golfing conditions.   
 Q.  You've seen it all.  Where does it rank already after day 1 as an event?  The crowds, it was built as a huge occasion.  
JUSTIN ROSE: Absolutely.  I think the crowd is fantastic.  They're a knowledgeable golf crowd.  Even though they haven't had a tournament up here, you can tell the passion for the game, it's authenticate up here, how much they love the sport, respect the sport.  I think they've given Tony, who's an American, got lots of support and encouragement out there.  I'm more of a homegrown player.   
I heard the cheers for the Northern Irish lads obviously when they teed off.  I felt like they've embraced everybody, which has been fantastic.   
 Q.  More to come from you?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it's a good thing for me to build on.  I think today was an important round just to get under my belt, and I know I can kick on from here.
