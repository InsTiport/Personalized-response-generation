Q.   Just seemed today not as?
JUSTIN ROSE:   It was definitely hard work today but I boil it down the front nine I was really having a hard time reading the greens, they were burned out much more today and they were just brown. 
For some reason it was hard to see the breaks on the front nine but I pulled it together really well on the back nine, felt I got into a really good competitive mode and made some key putts at the right time and really felt like I was in control of the golf swing. 
When I birdied 14, I didn't realise Jamie had had a hot round, I had actually expected to be one ahead at that point and I was one behind, so every credit to Jamie. 
You want to close out with a chance to win when you have it and didn't do that today but I didn't do a lot wrong, either.   It's hard to beat yourself up about it.   Jamie played a good round of golf today and ThorbjÃ¸rn did, as well. 
I did some things on the back nine that really, really counted to be honest.   I made some good putts and I hit a good putt at 18.   I really was enjoying the last hole to try to make birdie, force the playoff, and made four and a half. 

Q.   Exciting to be in that position? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Absolutely, yeah, back nine on Sunday is what it's all about.   I felt like I brought my best stuff on the back nine today rather than the front nine today, so that's encouraging.

Q.   And you have to be encouraged with your form and especially the majors coming up and the Masters?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, absolutely.   I don't think I need to do anything different.   Just need to keep chipping away and keep swinging well, and I think with the putter I'm gaining more confidence so believe I'm going to make the putts like at the last hole.   Obviously didn't go in this time, but I think the execution was just where it needed to be. 

Q.   What's your verdict on the week?
JUSTIN ROSE:   It was a long, hard week to end up finishing second. 
Obviously I ran with the lead the whole way and would have been lovely to finish it off wire‑to‑wire, and Jamie obviously played a good round of golf today which I expected.   It's hard to close out tournaments.   You can't just sit still and expect it to happen. 
I think today the front nine was a little bit flat, struggled to make some putts.   Didn't read the greens particularly well.   But on the back nine I really thought I brought some good stuff to the table.   I made some key putts when I had to, and a shame that one didn't go in on the last because I really thought I hit the perfect putt.

Q.   It was agonising, wasn't it, lipping out like that? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it reminded me exactly of the putt at 18 against Phil at Medinah, just outside right edge and that's exactly where I hit it, and unfortunately this time the putt didn't go in for me.   Would I swap it?   No, I wouldn't. 
Three seconds now in the UAE but keep chipping away at it.
