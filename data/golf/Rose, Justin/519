 Q. Nice way to end the week?
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yes exactly, to birdie the 16th and 18th and I think I also hit 16 greens in regulation today, that was pretty good. Despite the breeze out there, I had some great birdie chances. I putted really well all week, even when I shot 75 in the first round, I putted well, thankfully! But today I tried to stop myself second guessing the putts and holed a nice one on the 16th and 18th which means you come off the course feeling good. Today was an opportunity to go really low but I turned the week around from Thursday which was disappointing to get off to such a bad start as I had been playing nicely coming into here. But three rounds in the 60s here is not to be sniffed at. This is an easy tournament to give up in. It doesn't make that much difference to points or money whether you finish 30th, 40th or 50th, it is all much of a muchness but I didn't want to do that, I didn't want to give up, I wanted to push on. Actually I looked at this as an eight round run, the first round here was the first of an eight round sequence for me. So I am now trying to hang in there.

 Q. You must go to Hazeltine with some confidence then?
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yes although perhaps I didn't play as well this week as I did at the Open or the AT&T at Congressional but I think this has been the perfect warm up for me. I had two weeks off and this is the first week back and sometimes there is a bit of rustiness in your game and you have to get your thinking going again. But all in all, I am encouraged for next week. I played Hazeltine in 2002 and did fairly well as a young kid so I am looking forward to going back. I don't remember much about it but we'll see what's in store for us when I get there next week. But I take a lot of confidence there from three rounds in the 60s here.
