 Q.   Here with the victorious European side, Ian Poulter and Justin Rose.   At what point in the match this morning did you realize how crucial your match was going to be?   
IAN POULTER:   From that first tee shot to be honest.   It was absolutely key.   JosÃ© has put us out No.1 for a reason to go out and get a point and put a point on the board.   We got up early and then they came straight back at us with two quick holes, and then we rallied really well.   It was a tough‑‑ it was a bit of a doggy match at times, but that's foursomes, you've just got to get it done?  
   
 Q.   Talk about that first tee.   Was your reaction a direct response to what Bubba did yesterday afternoon?   
IAN POULTER:   Of course.   Bubba is Bubba.   He was pretty special yesterday, we were talking about it, and he was going to do it again today.   So why not stand there and enjoy the fun of what it was.   My heart rate went from I would say 100 to 180 pretty quickly, but I mean, it was a great buzz for sure.   
   
 Q.   Justin, this team will be broken up this afternoon.   What has made this particular team so good in the two sessions, two Ryder Cups that you guys have played together?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Well, we know each other well enough not to say sorry or not to feel like we have to say sorry if we hit a bad shot, and we back each other, especially around the greens.   Both have great short games, so we get it in trouble around the greens, I think we know we're saving par, and that can be tough to play sometimes.
