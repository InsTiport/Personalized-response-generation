  STEVE TODD:     Justin, we'll make a start, thanks for joining us.   As we just said, first appearance on European soil this year after a good start to the season.   Your thoughts coming into the week.
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it's exciting to be a part of this tournament.   I've played a couple of times, as it was formerly at Wentworth, and has a great history of champions.   Match play is always nice to play.   We don't get the opportunity to do it that much.   To get match‑play golf back in is a lot of fun. 
STEVE TODD:   Just your thoughts, you have Robert Rock, who has been in good form this year, and The Open Champion.
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, you're looking at 24 great players, I try not to look at a group and go, that's a difficult group or that's an easy group, because it's 18 holes of match play and anybody can beat anybody at this stage.   You just have to go through and take it match by match.   Two good players; certainly won't be going into any of those under‑prepared.   They are both good guys, as well.   I'm sure it will be fun games. 

Q.   Inaudible.
JUSTIN ROSE:   Good opportunity to remind myself that I have some match‑play skills. 
Yeah, match play is an interesting one, sometimes you can shoot 66 and lose.   Sometimes but you have to take it with a pinch of salt.   But at the same time, Ian Poulter has proved that there is a knack to it.   His Ryder Cup record is amazing, and he's won both world match play championships.   There is an art to it, I guess, and I'll be doing my best this year to try to figure that out even more. 
I'm hoping that good, solid golf will prevail and keep playing well. 

Q.   Do you like being more aggressive? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Well, I'm not sure that that's the way to do it to be honest.   You know, I think I've tried to do it in the past and you make mistakes, unnecessary mistakes.   You lose holes to par and that's the most frustrating thing, when you give away cheap holes.   Just try to stay in every hole. 
Even just play your own game; not necessarily you play the course or play the man.   I think sometimes if you just play your own game, and you believe in it and you trust it, that becomes very hard to beat.   You end up beating yourself that way, which can happen in match play.

Q.   Two putts off from winning the World Championship; how would you sum those up, or do golfers accept that it is an ebb and flow and wait for the next big week to come?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it's definitely an ebb and flow.   But compiled two Top‑10s post winning the Match Play, one being New Orleans, the Zurich Classic there, which is an event I haven't played well at in the past; so to go there and do much better as a golf course that I have not had any success on.
And same thing at Sawgrass, really.   I have never really played well there.   Unfortunately couldn't quite grasp that tournament again this year.   But my game has remained feeling very good. 

Q.   You talk about Ian Poulter and his match play, and the strange thing with him is he didn't have any in amateur golf, so what do you think his knack is? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I think‑‑ well, he's a great putter, I believe.   He seems to make clutch putts.   You know, in a 72‑hole tournament, there's only probably‑‑ well, clutch putting, there only seems to be coming down the back nine on Sunday, that it's perceived to be like that.   But in match play, you can have a putt for a halve, and like the whole round is a little bit more that way.   You're making putts to halve; you're making putts to win holes.   I think he's very good at that. 
He's obviously just one of those competitive guys, eye‑to‑eye, hates to lose, and that obviously works for him.

Q.   Would you say it's a friendly‑‑
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, we have a friendly rivalry for sure; whether it's just chipping competitions at Lake Nona or whatever it is, we both hate to lose.   But it's good.   We spur each other on sometimes in practise back home. 

Q.   Do you remember who you played in Wentworth?
JUSTIN ROSE:   Played Vijay the first time in 2002.   Lost on the 36th hole.   Seemed like a lot of golf to lose, you put a lot of effort, and you lose on the 18th in 36 and Hunter Mahan beat me four and three or something the next year, or not the next year; maybe 2007, it was.   So quite a big gap. 
STEVE TODD:   Thanks for joining us.
