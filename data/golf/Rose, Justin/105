 Q.  What are your thoughts right now?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Right now my thoughts are I'm delighted.  20 minutes ago, I was not very delighted.  You know, one birdie today, left it late till the 18th hole, but, obviously, that birdie was important for me to be in it for the week.  Well, I'm assuming.  66, I'm assuming, is going to stick in there for the weekend.  I kind of knew that 3 was the number I was trying to get to and left it late today.   
It was obviously more in the general scheme of things a frustrating day.  It was an opportunity today.  The course was as easy as you could hope for.  I was on the right side of the draw today.  It's only really the right side of the draw if you take advantage of it.  Although, if you look at the leaderboard, there's guys at 6-under from both waves, but this afternoon was an opportunity to score well.   
 Q.  Did it seem like you were missing a spot today (inaudible).  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, 100 percent.  I just felt very -- well, exactly.  I holed a par putt at 15, and I heard the crowd make a lovely cheering noise, and I'm like, man, that's what it feels like.  Literally, the whole day was oh, ah, oh.  And then the crowd are trying to cheer you up, and that kind of almost adds to the frustration because you sense they want it for you as well and nothing's happening.   
Yeah, very, very trying day, but kind of pleased I was able to dig deep down on 18.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it was a combination of, when I hit a good putt, it was running over the edge.  The speed of the read was just slightly off.  And a couple of occasions, like on 16, I had a great opportunity there, 10 foot, pretty straight putt, just pulled it to the left edge, and obviously didn't break back from there.  I knew it was a straight putt.  So just opportunities like that, not taking advantage of them.   
That's what you need to do, especially when you have those pretty easy putts.  Those are the ones you need to bury.  That's what happens when you're 3-over.  Those are the parts of your game that aren't unsung.  When you're 6 or 7-under, those are the things that go for you.  When you're 3-over, those are the things that don't go for you.   
Just got to try to turn it around for the weekend.  Be out there fairly early tomorrow and certainly try to get into the red as soon as I can and try to make a run.   
 Q.  I guess you want to take a little rest right now, but when will you have to switch on to begin to think about tomorrow?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Well, yeah.  Just have some dinner really, get some physio, and then get to bed as early as I can.  Yeah, just come out here tomorrow with a very aggressive mindset.  And then I'll think about how to attack this golf course and if I can figure it out on the weekend.   
 Q.  Your physio?  Have you got an injury?  
JUSTIN ROSE: No, maintenance.  Pretty much every player out here is doing the maintenance, physio recovery type work in the evening.
