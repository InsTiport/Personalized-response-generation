 Q.   Justin, quite a battle out there today.   Those windy conditions continued, and we had to play an extra day to finally finish this event.   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, you wouldn't have known this was a Monday with the crowds out there the way they grew.   Coming down the stretch, I just said to my caddy coming down 18, I said,  Pretty cool for a Monday.  Obviously, pretty much sure to see Tiger do the business, but it was nice to be part of it.  
   
 Q.   Third straight Top 10 for you.   What does this mean to your game as you progress forward in this season?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I think I take a lot of confidence out of this week.   I'm still not sort of getting the most out of my game, which is kind of nice to be having these results and still feel like there is a lot of room for improvement.   I had a really kind of flat back nine of my third round and start to my fourth round, really sort of a poor 12 holes there.   But it was nice to be able to put that behind me and finish strong, and I take a lot of confidence once again from that.  
   
 Q.   How much fun to be a part of Mr.Palmer's event, and get to play in front of him and be a part of this wonderful week?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, the Orlando crowd have been really good to me.   I felt like there was a lot of good will for me out there.   It's always nice to play at home and stay in my own bed.   Obviously, he's special for the game and special for this community.   So, yeah, to be a small part of the event was great.  
   
 Q.   Is having Arnie here, does that make it more special?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, no doubt.   I mean, you almost kind of look for him.   If I was about to win this tournament, I'd certainly be looking for him coming off 18.   That's what happened with my first event at Jack's place.   You're aware of their presence on 18.   It makes it a special week to be able to walk off and win a tournament like this and be able to shake one of the great's hands.  
   
 Q.   Can you imagine winning one tournament eight times like Tiger has won this one?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   It's hard to imagine.   I mean, it would be nice to imagine it, but to do it might be a little bit tougher.   But, you know, he's probably going to go win four or five of them because he's got three others cued up at seven, I believe.   
So, obviously, I think it's special for him to get his 8th at this event.  
   
 Q.   What makes him such a hard player to catch when he's obviously got a tremendous record?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   I think he plays every shot like he plays them on Sunday.   His intensity is the same on Thursday often as it is on Sunday, and that makes Sunday a lot less different for him.   He plays in that kind of atmosphere far more regularly than a lot of guys do, and it's adjustment for most of us.   It's a known for him.   
Obviously, he's been doing it for 15 years now, so he certainly has a lot of skills and a lot of experience under his belt.   
But, basically, it's his execution, his commitment to the shots, and he's always drawing up what he intends to do.   That's why he gets frustrated at times because he's always looking at hitting the right shot at the right time.  
   
 Q.   I want to say intimidation, but is this reminiscent of sort of what guys used to sort of experience with him two, three, four, five years ago?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Maybe a little bit, sure.   But, obviously, I really enjoyed my first two rounds playing with him.   I thought it brought the best out of me at times, But frustrated with myself yesterday because I wanted to be a part of the last group.   
So you've got to take the challenge on.   It doesn't mean it's going to be easy, but you can't shy away from it, too.   I think the more times you can put yourself, it's like what makes him so good is he's been in contention so much, the more times you play with him down the stretch, the easier that becomes for you.   So you've got to take that challenge on when you can.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned the first two rounds playing with him from a golf standpoint, in terms of the shots he's hitting now compared to a year ago, two years ago?   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I would say iron play and putting is looking fantastic, absolutely.   He can tune‑up a couple areas of his game.   But when he's got mid‑iron in his hand, there is nobody better by the looks of it.   Quality of ball strike is back.   
I thought on Friday, he could have shot 65; he shot 70.   That was the day he let the round slip.   But that just shows he's able to get those quality shots to go low again.
