 Q.   Justin, a third round of 65, which we'll kind of describe as Justin Rose golf.   How would you describe it?  
    JUSTIN ROSE:   Solid golf.   Obviously bogey free, so that's always good.   There are going to be some chances out there, and it was nice.   I kept patient.   I started birdie, birdie, birdie last night and then kind of went flat a little bit through the middle of the round, started this morning with a very simple up‑and‑down which I didn't get up‑and‑down for par on no. 7 and then I had to stay patient, but then again got rewarded with birdies at 10 and 11, which felt like I got my momentum going, and then took care of the last hole, which I felt was important to make birdie at 18.  
   
 Q.   What was the sense of how the course is after yesterday's storm?  
    JUSTIN ROSE:   You know, it's better than yesterday.   Obviously it was very sloppy last night.   Obviously incredibly wet out there and couldn't probably play without preferred lies, but at least there's no casual water, or not too much casual water out there.   So from my perspective it's playing much better.  
   
 Q.   In that they haven't redrawn, you're going to be out there three or four holes ahead of the last group.   Does that give you a chance to really add the pressure?  
    JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah.   It puts me into sort of unknown territory really.   So yeah, just means I gotta get my head down and shoot as low as I can, obviously, because the leaders are three or four back on this golf course, it's yielding a lot of birdies, if I draw level, I might still be two behind, if you know what I mean, so I just really gotta go and try to shoot as low of score as possible.
