JUSTIN ROSE: Really last week in Napa, I struggled with my game but gave myself a chance to win on Sunday.  Yesterday in the Pro-Am, I didn't make a birdie all day, and was struggling.  Fooch gave me a little bit of a swing tip, said I looked a little back on my heals and posture and stuff.  Amazing how you can make a simple adjustment like that and began to build some confidence today.   
Played a really good, solid patient round of golf.  I even putted pretty well today, a lot of putts slid by the edge but very happy with 65.  It's a good start to the tournament.   
 Q.  The back nine, you seemed to, very steady front nine and that putt on 10 seemed to get you going?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, to shoot 4-under on the back nine was obviously good.  Just took a couple chances and made the most of a couple chances.  Rolled in a couple of putts.  Obviously No. 10 was a nice one.  Set some momentum, because I felt like I was playing better than 1-under on the front nine.  I had some chances that were sliding by the edge.   
The one at 10 helped me keep some momentum and stopped me getting frustrated.   
 Q.  Do you feel the back nine is probably the scoring nine here?  Because you're starting on 11 tomorrow; there's a chance to put a bit of distance in.  
JUSTIN ROSE: Probably is the scoring nine if you think about it.  But there's chances all over the golf course if you play well.   
So I'm not going to chase anything.  It's obviously very early in the tournament.  No need to do anything different tomorrow.  Keep the ball in play and keep the same strategy and keep trying to execute the same shots.   
It's a great platform in which to build, don't have to chase anything.  Allows the luxury of being patient occasionally.  In 72 holes, you're always going to have your slightly flat spell, so it's nice to get off to a good start.   
 Q.  Looks like you're going to lay the ghost of 2011 when you didn't quite make the cut.  
JUSTIN ROSE: Well, you obviously come here this week, not really thinking about that.  Just trying to sort of get to grips with the golf course and that's been my focus, really, how do you play this golf course.  I think I probably had a much better idea this time around how to play it than I did last time.  Yeah, I can focus on more positive things now.
