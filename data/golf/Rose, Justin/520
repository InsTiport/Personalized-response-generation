 Q. How do you feel about 136 for the weekend?
 JUSTIN ROSE: Well, I got better as the week went on and so I am pretty happy to be honest with you. I started off a little bit ropey but as I said I got better and my scoring got better and I was bogey free until the last hole today and that would have been a nice achievement but never mind. I feel like each day I have made three or four bogeys which means you cannot go really low. 
 Yesterday I made seven birdies, but the four bogeys makes it like an average to good round. I kept the bogeys off the card today until the 18th and then I hit that shot left which is what has been plaguing me a little bit to be honest the last few weeks. But for the most part I hit the ball really nicely and I feel a lot more relaxed and the putting is coming around so basically I am trying to keep this momentum going as we head into Bay Hill, Houston and the Masters.
