 Q.  67, happy?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, I'm happy.  It's a good start.  I played really, really well today.  I drove the ball exceptionally well, which is obviously what I need to do around here.  I gave myself a ton of chances.  I had loads of putts that just slipped by the edge.   
5-under is good, but one of those days, you're like; if some putts.  But especially the back nine today, which was my back nine, the front nine -- left a few out there, but that's encouraging.  First round back after a month or so, so to get under par and a solid start, very, very happy.   
 Q.  How were conditions?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Perfect.  They were gorgeous.  Wind was light and variable.  The only thing you have to deal with towards the back end of the field was a bit of traffic on the greens.   The greens have been soft this year based on a lot of rain last week, so there was a bit of sort of like spike marks and stuff like that.   
But other than that, that was the only thing impeding good scoring.  It was right there in front of you.  You could control the ball on the greens.   It was fairly soft.  You know, it was there for the taking today.   
 Q.  As you said, very happy with the start to the round?  
JUSTIN ROSE: Absolutely.  Hopefully we can build on it now for the rest of the week.
