Q. Justin, you've gone 36 holes now without a bogey.  Striking it well.
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah.  I'm pretty happy with that because the course is firming up.  It's not -- there's enough breeze out there where it's not straight in front of you.  Lot of tricky club-making decisions out there.  To keep bogies off the card has been great.
Q. You know, I still remember you chipping in on the 17th hole at Cog Hill to win your first BMW Championship.  So, who knows?  You're a little far back but who knows what Sundays holds.
JUSTIN ROSE: Leishman is playing great, Rickie and Jason.  You got to factor they're going to continue to play great.  The lead will probably stretch out to somewhere near 20 at, least.
Obviously puts me kind of having to play a great round of golf.  That will be the goal and obviously -- but, at this time of year, you're trying to position yourself to get to Atlanta.  The closer I can get to the Top-5, the better.
Q. Well played.  See you on Sunday.
