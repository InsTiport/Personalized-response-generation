  Q. Not the best day, but overall a good week.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, overall a good week. But it was an interesting day actually. I felt really in control the beginning of the round. Kind of a case of I didn't really get anything out of the first six, seven holes; hit a lot of good putts, burned a lot of edges early.   
 And yeah, I mean, the 7th hole was kind of key. I hit a great tee shot, loved it off the tee, got down there, rolled through the fairway and then I got a bit of a flier with the second. Hit another great shot right over the flag but then three-putted. And then the momentum kind of stalled from there. That was hard.   
 I don't know, just seemed to lose my focus or whatever it was. It was kind of a weird day. I felt like had things just gone my way a little better the first few holes I would have been in, would have been set. But it always felt like a little bit of a struggle.  
  
  Q. After a round like this, three good prior rounds, what do you take away from it as you head to Bay Hill?  
 JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, mindset is still good. Obviously you try to learn from all situations. I don't really know what I can learn from today right now. It's a case of I started off doing everything right, made one or two mistakes, and it just felt like it got away from me just a little bit, swinging a little quick, hit a couple bad shots. I was trying everything right, it just wasn't really happening. It just turned into a hard day.   
 Momentum-wise, too, you kind of get the vibe from the crowd and people willing you on, and it just sort of felt very flat. I was trying to keep myself -- picking myself up. Birdied 11, kept believing at that point, hit a great putt at 12 that I couldn't miss, and I just felt like I needed something to go my way just to boost me back up. It didn't happen.
