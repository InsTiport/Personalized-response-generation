 Q.   A couple comments about the third round.   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Well, it was definitely different to the first couple days.   I actually played really well today, terrible finish.   Well, my last four holes, which was disappointing.   I had it to 4‑under.   I hit a good shot into 15, caught a little gust and dribbled back down into the water.   Yeah, that was a turning point.   And from there just bad made decisions.   Hit the wrong club into 16, hit it long left there, and that's a terrible place to try and two‑putt from and just sort of died it down the ridge, ended up four‑putting there, and then I guess my mind was racing a little bit from that point.  
   
 Q.   If you had given yourself some homework to do tonight, what would it be?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   I'm done thinking about it now.   I've been putting poorly all week.
