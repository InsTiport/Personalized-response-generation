Q. Tough day?
JUSTIN ROSE: Tough day for everybody, yeah.  You just look at the scoreboard.  Seems like everyone fell apart.  There was no chasing pack today.  Obviously it was a three-horse race all day.  It was hard to kind of keep the mistakes off the card completely today.
Yeah, it was fun.  It was a fun battle.  I was always just one or two shots behind, it felt on the back nine, but I birdied 13 and 14 to give myself a chance, and still had a chance I felt when I hit my iron shot into 17.
Hit a good iron shot into there and Xander made his putt.  I missed my putt.  I was two behind playing the last trying to force something there.  I was in the hunt, and a decent defence.  Yeah, solid week.
Q. Next week, another defence.  How much are you looking forward to that?
JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, for sure.  Obviously I have events I've got to defend between this week -- two left Turkey and Indonesia.  I've never defended a tournament before, so that's the goal for this run is to defend one of them.
