 Q.   Give us some thoughts on your round today.   
JUSTIN ROSE:   Obviously very happy with that start today.   I felt like we were going to get the best of the conditions today.   I was actually surprised the wind kicked up as much as it did early in the round.   
I looked at the scoreboard and the guys weren't having too much trouble with it and I think that's down to the fact that the greens were soft.   I felt like the course was there for the taking, you could be aggressive with your iron play, and I was happy to get off to a good start.   
   
 Q.   Were you looking for something on the range?   It looked like you weren't all together pleased with how you were hitting the ball and then you went out and hit it just beautifully.   
JUSTIN ROSE:   That's one of those weird days in the game of golf.   It was pretty awful on the range and had not much feeling of anything of what I was doing.   Having played quite well recently it was a bit out of a blue moon.   And all Sean could offer was, take a couple of deep breaths and good luck.   Because everything looked okay, but I just didn't have any feel today.   
Sometimes it lowers the expectation.   I saw Harris English swing off first tee and I kind of thought, okay, I can do something like that.   He's got a great move through the ball and it sort of reminded me of what I should be doing.   
So basically Harris was my warm‑up, watching him hit off the first tee, and I kind of had it from there.  
   
 Q.   You got quite a relatively modest record here, did you try something new this time?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   It's a nice way to put it, yeah.   Modest.   Obviously, I've known, I've certainly been aware of the fact that I haven't played well here.   
I looked at my strategy and I changed it a little bit.   Holes like 6 I don't play aggressively anymore.   
Maybe 7 hit 3‑wood off the tee.   
I think I just try and get the ball in play off the tee a lot more than I have in the past.   We'll see how that works.   If that will remain the same.   Will that work well on a Thursday as well as a Sunday?   
But it paid off today.   I was pleased with the way I played in terms of I played the par‑5s even par and still got a good round of golf going.   So that tells me, tomorrow, if I take care of the par‑5s, I can keep some momentum going with that.   
   
 Q.   Some nice results you're getting.   What's building in your game the last month?  
JUSTIN ROSE:   I think scoring ability more than anything, really.   I don't feel like I'm playing any better.   I've been swinging the club well on the range all year.   I've been waiting to turn it around on the golf course or take it to the golf course.   
Even the last few weeks I don't feel like I had my so‑called A game, but figuring out how to get it in the hole, chip and putt, grind a little bit more, stay a bit more patient.   Just sort of playing a bit more golf you get into that rhythm.   
I think that's, this is what I've been waiting for, really, is just to sort of be ready to go and looking forward to the rest of the season.
