  Q.  Were you excited to finish with 72?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, I was pleased.  Actually every time I pulled driver today, which was quite a lot, I missed every fairway every time I hit driver.  I guess that's what kills you on this golf course, especially today with it being a little windier.  It was just a tough day.  To be honest, it was the kind of day where I felt like all my good putts weren't going in, either, and then to turn around and make three in a row was really -- that saved the day, really, to be honest with you.   
  
  Q.  Patience is so important on a golf course like this.  Do you feel particularly strong in that department?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, I was tested today, I have to admit.  I can't say it was easy.  But I think certainly a year ago I probably would have been frustrated at that point and therefore it would have been hard to turn things around.  Certainly that's a big improvement in my game right now.   
  
  Q.  A bit like a U.S. Open where par is a good score and that's what you're focused on?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, definitely, if you hang around par you're not going to be far away.  My guess is 2-, 3-, 4-under might win this.  Depends how much they let the course go over the weekend as far as moisture, but it's not going to be many under par, I know that.   
  
  Q.  Are you going to go out and practice driving a little bit?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  I don't know, actually.  I might actually do myself more harm than good.  I might just go have a good rest and come out here 15, 20 minutes early tomorrow.  It's nothing serious.  That's the good news.   
  
  Q.  Did you catch a bad lie at the last for your second shot?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  I missed the fairway right, and obviously I was -- I had a clean lie but I had a bunch of roots in front of me, so I knew that if I tried anything adventurous I could have injured myself.  I think that's the key on this golf course, though, if you do miss the fairway, not to try and be too adventurous or too aggressive.  If you lay up to a good number and try -- up-and-down with a wedge, that's a good way to go.   
  
  Q.  Lee Westwood was saying, actually, he's been here six times, I think, you've got to build your score quietly; you don't just go away and blast everything, do you?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, exactly.   
  
  Q.  You can't be too aggressive, just have to wait for it to happen.   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  It's the kind of golf course you have to respect the pin placements and it's the kind of week you need to putt well, really.  That's what it boils down to, hit it in the greens as much as possible, eliminate the bogeys, and if you make a few putts, it's not a bad strategy any week, but it's more relevant this week.   
  
  Q.  A bit like a major championship, really, isn't it?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Yeah, it's a lot like a major championship out here, sure.  I'd have to say that this setup won't be far off what Southern Hills is going to be.  I mean, I've never been there, but I'd guess it's a similar feeling to the course.  Great preparation for next week.   
  
  Q.  Hotter than here?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Hotter than here, yeah.   
  
  Q.  You were hinting that there's probably been a mental change in your attitude over the last 12 months?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Well, I think 12 months ago I was chasing my position in the World Rankings, chasing my position on the Order of Merit, and when you're there it's a lot easier to be a little bit more philosophical out on the course in terms of, well, I'll just put it down to a bad week or whatever it may be.  So there's less pressure on you in that regard.  But at the same time, looking at this tournament, I realize that patience is a big factor of this tournament itself.   
 But I must say, today I felt tested on that front but managed to come through, which was good.   
  
  Q.  What got you going then at 15?  Was that a good putt or a good tee shot?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Good tee shot, actually, probably the first good swing I've made all day.  I felt like the previous four or five holes I hit great putts and they just all seemed to run over the edge of the hole, so it was nice to see a putt disappear.   
 16, yeah, we were right in between 9 and wedge, 9 and wedge, 9 and wedge, and just felt a gust downwind and went with a wedge, which was the only club we could hit to get it close to that front pin, so that worked out for me.  Hit another good iron shot into 17 to two, three feet.   
 Yeah, bogey aside, obviously delighted to finish.   
  
  Q.  Are you going to defend your Australian Masters title?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Looking very probable.  That's what I'll say right now.   
  
  Q.  What's your schedule look like?  Are you going to play much?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  I don't know.  Depends on the U.S. PGA -- obviously I'd love to play Sun City, see what happens there.  There's a few good events.  Really it's a bit up in the air right now.  We'll see how my fitness feels.  I don't want to push it, either.  I've had a funny year fitness-wise, and I'd almost like to use the end of the year as a time to get stronger.   
  
  Q.  You might be playing in the PGA Grand Slam?   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Could be, yeah.
