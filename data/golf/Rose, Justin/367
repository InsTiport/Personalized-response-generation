Q.   The putt over 18 just a little quicker than you expected? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, I guess so.   You know, it was a putt, I pretty much knew where I stood in the tournament.   I knew everything.   I felt like it was a putt to make, a putt I could make. 
It was uphill, I thought, a little left‑to‑right and obviously I hit it‑‑ it's gone off in my hands a little bit.   I was surprised to see it go five feet by, I mean, I've got to say.   But it is what it is.   Disappointing way to finish. 
So in some ways, surprised 11‑under par was where it was in the tournament.   Some guys were clearly struggling out there on the back nine, which I guess is a testament to how good a round I put together, but yeah, disappointing to finish that way obviously.

Q.   After missing the first one, what happened on the second one? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I think it was a right‑center putt and to be honest with you, I couldn't tell you if I pushed it.   I didn't really feel like I pushed it, but it wandered off to the right. 
So I'm not going to stand here and complain about it or whatever.   I had to thread it through a couple spike marks I felt, but I aimed right‑center, I had my head down and I felt like I put a reasonable roll on it, and it missed.   I guess sometimes you can't do more than that.   The error was putting myself in that situation.   You're clearly a little bit nervous at that point and you really don't want to give yourself five feet coming back.
But at the same time, like I said I felt good on both putts, I really felt like I was going to make the first one and that was going to be my opportunity. 
I felt like if I was going to be in a playoff to win this golf tournament, I was going to have to make a putt at some point.   That was my mind‑set, obviously, and clearly got too aggressive.

Q.   Quite a crowded board with some great players up there.   Did it feel like an important day? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, it is, obviously it's an important day.   I felt like the whole‑‑ the run for the FedExCup Playoffs has only just started and I felt like where my game was this week, I didn't expect to be in this position.   I felt like I was working my way back to playing well. 
Surprised to see it all come together this week, but I feel like that I can get so much stronger, really, the remaining few weeks of the season. 

Q.   Not the finish you wanted but overall, the first Playoff event this year in New York, what was it like out there and what were the fans like? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, fun, good crowd, good energy, great weather in the end.   Obviously we had a tough first day out there, but a couple long rounds to get the tournament going.   But obviously a beautiful setting to play golf.   The changes to Liberty National have been well received and the course has played really well.   Obviously New York is always a fun place to play golf, and definitely a different energy being the Playoffs.

Q.   On 18 ‑‑ 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I feel like in some ways I was surprised that 11 was the number, didn't really expect to be the case.   It was playing tougher than I thought and I was able to put a clean round together. 

Q.   A lot of positives moving forward in the FedExCup Playoffs. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, absolutely.   I haven't really been playing that well the last few weeks and again, beginning part of this week and the Pro‑Am, I struggled.   I really feel good about the way I built my game this week, and the Playoffs are a long run.   I knew during the four weeks, I was going to put myself in contention, and I think I feel really comfortable with where my game is at and that I can make a really good run at Atlanta.
