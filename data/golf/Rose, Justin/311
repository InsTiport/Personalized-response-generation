  JUSTIN ROSE:   Today's round was a bit of a sort of struggle.   I never got comfortable on the greens today, and it's hard work when you‑‑ I drove, though, the snot out of it today and gave myself every opportunity to play and to play well. 
But couldn't really get going, you know, just didn't make any putts today.   I just‑‑ the greens were so soft and so many heel prints, and that's all I was seeing.

Q.   Really? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I wasn't really seeing the back of the cup today.   I was kind of seeing what was in my way. 
So I didn't really have the feel of it very well.   But all in all, another good week.   Four rounds par or better around this golf course.   I think in The Open Championship, I was par or better four rounds.   Probably puts me at 17‑‑ 15 par or better rounds in a row. 
So I'm playing good going into next week.

Q.   Your thoughts turn immediately to the last major? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Obviously, I won going into the last major, which didn't work out for me.   I'm hoping now this was just the form I needed to go into last week.   So I didn't really use up anything over the weekend.

Q.   In Valhalla, obviously good memories of '08 there for you. 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Yeah, somewhat vague, to be honest with you.   Looking forward to again figuring out the course.   I think they've changed the greens extensively since we played.   All the notes we had kind of go out the window.

Q.   How are you getting there? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I'm flying in about an hour.   Yeah, I might even get out there early tomorrow morning, get the majority of my work done and see the golf course.   Might just walk it with a wedge and a putter tomorrow, really figure out the greens.   Then play nine, nine Tuesday, Wednesday.
