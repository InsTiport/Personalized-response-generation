 Q.  12-under, one of the most incredible matches ever, and we enjoyed thoroughly, tell us what it was like to be part of it.  HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, I was it was one-half Stenson, one-and-a-half part Rose.  Justin played phenomenally all week, and luckily I was there to back him up on a couple of occasions. And I guess I played the best shot of the day on 15 there, could have been a good position going into 16, but Justin took care of it anyway.  I was worried, hit the back bunker with a 3-wood and tried to take a bit off it, but obviously that didn't work out too well.  But he played an unbelievable chip and closed out the match. But it's been a great two days, and like I said, he's played great golf.   Q.  You birdied every hole in the middle of the round there and you're playing in front of these fans for the first time.  Try and tell us about the adrenaline rush.  JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it is amazing.  I think obviously I really got into reading the greens well today and I just had the feeling of the anticipation of what it's going to feel like to make putts today.  When you get into that mind-set, and you just see the ball going in the hole and you sort of get those positive vibes, today was a day it all happened for me. There were some key moments in the round.  Hit a shortish putt at 7, missed it; we were 2-down, Henrik made that and that really started the momentum swing. We set a mini goal of getting back to all-square by the 16th tee.  We knew we were up against it today with two great players.  Matt and Bubba played really well.  We were all-square playing 16, we knew we had to play great golf to get to that point but to close it out on 16 is phenomenal.   Q.  Is the back good enough to go again?  HENRIK STENSON: No, I'm resting in the afternoon.
