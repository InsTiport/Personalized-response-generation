   JUSTIN ROSE: Even though the result doesn't go your way, it's tough to take, but The Ryder Cup should be a hard-fought competition, and this year that's what it's back to being. I think the last two Ryder Cups, the Europeans have had exceptional results, and I think -- I don't think anyone was kidding ourselves and we were not thinking it was going to be another route. We knew it was going to be a tight game.
 I think this golf course ultimately suited their style of play and I think Captain Azinger set this up for the big hitters. J.B. Holmes contributed well. It's part of the home-course advantage.

 Q. Picking the singles order, Nick Faldo said it was a team thing and a very, very difficult thing to do, and in the end, the guys who were up, the results didn't count; it's a difficult call, isn't it? 
 JUSTIN ROSE: If you look at it, we've got 2 1/2 points out of four to start out with, and we kind of had some strong players in the back, too, that were all pulling through. 
 The middle of the order you expect one or two points there, but Boo Weekley, 7-under par; Kenny Perry was 7-under par today, J.B. Holmes finished in style. There's three guys there who probably played better than you maybe expected them to play. You've just got to take your hat off sometimes, and the Americans played really, really well. Oliver Wilson is 4-under par with no bogeys and lost three and two. Sometimes you can't account for that.
