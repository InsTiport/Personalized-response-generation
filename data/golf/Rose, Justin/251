 Q.  Thinking of all the characteristics of a major championship, it seems to have really firmed up.  JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, it played again good today.  Obviously, I had -- I actually played really, really well today.  Once again, drove the ball phenomenally well to give myself every opportunity to go low.  I'm not seeing the course playing that tough right now, because I'm playing really well.  I just didn't get anything out of today.  It was kind of frustrating. When I hit it at the flag, the ball goes a long way around here.  Just a little bit of altitude, may only be like 1,000 feet.  When it gets warm, the ball really travels.  There's swelling winds out there.  So it's really tough to get it close to the pin.  I had long wedges in my hand.  When you have that, I feel like you should be making birdies.   Q.  I saw some wedges making big first hops.  You didn't see it out there?  JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, but stop within five yards.  Sometimes it's actually easier to get it closer to the hole when it's bounce stop.  Sometimes it harder when jack in back 15 feet to get it tight to the pin.  I didn't really have a problem of feeling like I'm getting close today.   Q.  If that's your worst round of the week, you'll be in good shape.  JUSTIN ROSE: Yeah, absolutely.  Jim's playing some great ball.  These conditions, the course is playing short, so it gives him every great opportunity to make more birdies.  But, yeah, I'm in a good position going into the weekend.
