Q. Must have been difficult to come back to finish your round yesterday.  Quite the finish today.
RUMI YOSHIBA: I didn't have much sleep last night because I had a little bit of a problem from getting out from here.
Q. But you must be pleased with minus 4 from your first round?
RUMI YOSHIBA: I'm very, very pleased for this course.
Q. What did you do last night when you finished your game, when you went back to the hotel?
RUMI YOSHIBA: Just went to the bed straight.  Just doing the same thing as normal, I clean up my golf club and everything before I go to bed.
