  Q. Omar, you had it on fire today. The only mistake just from being a little aggressive at 17. But man 65, good playing.   
 OMAR URESTI: Yeah, thanks. It was actually on 16; I had a downhill putt and it just kind of went off in my hand, ran it by about 8 or 10 feet and then didn't hit a very good one coming back up.   
 But I hit it really good today. I actually holed one out on the 12th hole for eagle with a 9-iron from 134 yards. You know, then I went birdie, birdie after that to kind of keep me going.   
 To be able to hit 18 in 2 and 2-putt for birdie, it was a good feeling, a good way on finish.  
  
  Q. Was the eagle the catalyst that got things going, or have you been playing with a lot of confidence lately?  
 OMAR URESTI: Actually, it got me going. I had a couple birdies on the front nine.   
 Just played good, consistent golf. Then I hit it about 4 inches on 10 with a little wedge. Made a good par on 11. Then, like I said, I holed that shot on 12. And I hit it about 4 feet on 13, and made about a 30-footer on 14. So it was a good feeling to be able to get going after that.  
  
  Q. Omar, good playing. Thanks for talking to us. Keep it up on Sunday.   
 OMAR URESTI: My pleasure. Thank you.
