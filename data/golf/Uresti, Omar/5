OMAR URESTI:  I think this week I might have been down in the 60th percentile where normally I'm in the mid 70s.  That might have hurt me a little bit, as well.  Once again, I made some good putts.  My putting is coming around.
Q.  Anywhere else you'll be able to play?
OMAR URESTI:  I'll be in Memphis now for sure.  I'll crossing my fingers seeing if Colonial is going to call me maybe for a sponsor exemption there, but last time I talked to them, they had given all their spots out.  I'm not holding my breath too much.

Hopefully the U.S. Open, as well, and we'll see    if I play well in Memphis, I might even have a chance    actually I'd have to get in next week and play well at Colonial to have a chance at Memorial.
Q.  (Inaudible).
OMAR URESTI:  Hopefully this tie for 3rd will help me there.
Q.  What does it mean to not only get a sponsor exemption but take advantage of it?
OMAR URESTI:  It means a great deal.  I've had a couple sponsor exemptions before where I haven't played so well, and it's a little embarrassing and you kind of feel bad for taking up a spot and not performing.

This week to be able to tie for 3rd on a sponsor exemption is a great feeling, and I thank Mr. Nelson and the rest of the Byron Nelson committee.
Q.  I know you said you weren't focused on the money, but did it go through your mind?
OMAR URESTI:  Yeah, after Immelman hit it in the water, I ran in to see what 2nd place would have done, and it's quite a difference (laughter).  But at the same time, Trevor hit a great shot in there after hitting it in the water and making that putt, so kudos to him.  That was a great shot.  And then Adam Scott to be able to make birdie there, as well.  That's some good golf shots hit.
