 Q.  You had played three times in the PGA and tell me about this year versus past years?  
OMAR URESTI: Yeah, this year I just hit my five -- I had a lot of 5-woods and hybrids into some of these greens and I just, it was about the worst I ever hit my 5-wood in my life.  It was very disappointing.  I hit a few bad hybrids as well.  So it's just very frustrating out there for me and just -- and then the greens just weren't very kind to me either.  I missed -- they were a little slow, I left a few short and then I had a couple 3-putts and just wasn't able to capitalize on some of the good shots I hit.  So it was just, it was just a tough week, played a little bit tougher than I expected, just with the length.  And when you're -- my 5-wood, when your 5-wood's not working, for me that kind of hurts.  And then I just didn't get up-and-down like I normally do either.  I left myself some difficult bunker shots and stuff like that.
