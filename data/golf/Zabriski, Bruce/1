 Q. How did it go today?
 BRUCE ZABRISKI: It was okay. It got very tough. The wind and the conditions and the course is so great and you add that all up and it was a tough day. Grueling. 

 Q. Going into the week did you have anything in mind of what you wanted to accomplish or do?
 BRUCE ZABRISKI: Well, I hadn't been playing so great. I've been working on my game getting ready for this. This is a big deal for us, you know. And so I've been trying to work on it. But things just, you know, very, not doing so great with my game. My short game's good, it's just my hitting. And you got to drive the ball here. And that's what's hurting me.

 Q. So tomorrow we're hoping for blue skies and no wind?
 BRUCE ZABRISKI: That would be great.
