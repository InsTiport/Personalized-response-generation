 Q.  Solid round of golf.  Is that how it felt?  
DAVID HORSEY: Yeah, I didn't play quite as good as I did Friday but kept it together.  Some good up-and-downs towards the end.  Yeah, very pleased with obviously shooting 64 on Sunday.  So, yeah, nice bit of form to take into the end of the year.   
 Q.  What pleased you the most today?  
DAVID HORSEY: Just the fact I kept it together when things weren't quite feeling great.  Sort of hit it in the trees down four and managed to make a great five there.  I was really pleased with that.   
I didn't quite get it close enough; birdied 6, couple of poor tee shots.  I didn't drive it particularly well but on the whole, really just holing out really well.  Putted nicely today and that showed in the score.   
 Q.  Is that a continuation of recent form?  
DAVID HORSEY: It's been coming.  A little bit inconsistent still since finishing second in Denmark.  Hopefully kick on with this result into The Final Series starting in a few weeks.   
 Q.  What can you take into next week and beyond?  
DAVID HORSEY: I know 64, obviously the conditions are very, very favorable.  There's no wind out there.  It's soft, so you can fire at flags and if you're holing putts, you're going to shoot low scores.   
Turkey is my next event now.  Obviously great memories of that place from last year, so draw on that and take the form with it.   
 Q.  How excited are you about the tournaments coming up?  
DAVID HORSEY: Just trying to keep playing really and play like I have done today and Friday sort of into The Final Series, and then hopefully I'll have a very strong finish to the year and enjoy Christmas.
