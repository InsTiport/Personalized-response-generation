 Q.  David, an opening round 68.  Pretty nice to finish off with a birdie on the last there, as well.  
DAVID HORSEY: Yeah, I finished strong.  Started off a little bit indifferent.  Managed to somehow make two on the fourth.  Slapped a 3-iron, pitched on the front iron, rolled down to 25 feet and holed it.  That's golf.   
Sort of steadied myself from there.  Played a little bit better after that.  Still a few ropey shots but nice to finish strong with three in the last six.   
 Q.  You had a couple good rounds over the weekend last year.  What is the key to shooting low on this golf course?  
DAVID HORSEY: You've got to be good at everything really.  You have to be in the fairway because these flags are all sort of tucked away on ledges and bowls sometimes.  Like 16 today is on the top left; if you're not in the fairway, you have no chance of getting close to that one.   
But there's still a lot of easy holes.  You just have to be fairly direct with your approach shots, get it in close and try to read the greens.  Greens are quite tricky.   
 Q.  You were tied six in Italy, your best performance in a Rolex Series Event.  How nice would it be to continue that form in the final event of the year?  
DAVID HORSEY: Yeah, definitely.  Last event for me in the 2017 season.  Yeah, it would be nice to finish strong, enjoy Christmas and come out firing in Abu Dhabi.
