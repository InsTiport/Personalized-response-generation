DAVID HORSEY: Very, very pleasing, scorable out there.  Quite tough when the wind came down, cold early on but very, very pleased.
Q. A course that you like?
DAVID HORSEY: Yeah, I played it once a few years ago but don't really remember it.  Yeah, it's very scorable if you get it in the right places.  The greens are rolling pure, so if you do give yourself 12-, 15-foot foot for birdie on the scorable holes, you'll make a lot of birdies.
Q. Is that how you picked up your shots, 12- to 15-footers?
DAVID HORSEY: Yeah, I missed a few short ones actually towards the end of the front nine.  Sloppy bogey on 11,  I played very solid and didn't feel like I putted my best today but managed to finish strong with birdie on 16 and 18, very pleased with the score.
Q. Nice going week-to-week knowing the game is there?
DAVID HORSEY: Yeah, just trying to push on and keep contending now.  Had a few good finishes but never really been in contention.  If I can just keep my head down and keep doing what I'm doing the next few days, give myself a chance come Sunday.
Q. Is it all the more important, British Masters, kind of at home?
DAVID HORSEY: Yeah, being in front of the British fans is always a pleasure.  They are very knowledgeable and very supportive, as well.  When you're out there, you try to sort of blank out the fact that it is the British Masters, but yeah, when you hear the crowd behind you coming down those holes, and you make a few birdies and hear the cheers, it's always nice.
