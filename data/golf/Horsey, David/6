 Q.  You came to the course today seven shots back.  Did you really believe you had a chance?  
DAVID HORSEY: I sort of thought, if I could get to sort of 20, that would be a reasonable effort and put a little bit of pressure.  Just wanted to put a little pressure early doors and thankfully was able to do that.  Just ran out of a bit of steam there on the back nine.   
Pleased with how I played.  Probably the best I've played all week, so yeah, a little disappointed I couldn't keep it going on the back nine.   
 Q.  Were you aware you were as close as two shots at one stage?  
DAVID HORSEY: I wasn't really sure.  I wasn't looking at leaderboards.  Like I said, I sort of had 20 in my head as to what I needed to get to, and obviously 5-under through nine, it was realistically possible.   
Some poor wedge shots early in the back nine and didn't quite get it close enough.  But yeah, I knew it was about 19, 20 all the time, so I knew I needed to get to 20, 21, to have a chance.   
 Q.  What do you take from this?  
DAVID HORSEY: A lot of confidence, probably as relaxed as I've ever felt playing in contention.  If I can just sort of tidy up in a few areas, there's no reason why I can't continue contending in the near future.
