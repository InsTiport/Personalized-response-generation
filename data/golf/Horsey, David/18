   DAVID HORSEY: I didn't play that great to be honest. Scored well. It's a strange one, really, 5-under, and three bogeys in there, and sort of felt like it could have been better really to be honest. No, obviously very pleased. The course suits my eye and a bit of work now and hopefully keep pushing on on the week end.

 Q. From what I've been told, the pin positions are a bit tougher, take them on and you can get a birdie but miss them and you can get a bogey?
 DAVID HORSEY: 6 is a tough one, comes across to the eye quite easy but then you have sort of slopes. It's set up well. Rewards a good shot and punishes a bad shot. That's how a golf course should be set up. No need to make them 7,500 yards. A course like this, good pin positions, it can play really tough.

 Q. Are you due a big result?
 DAVID HORSEY: Yeah, keep going really and see what happens. Not really putting too much pressure on myself. Just go and play and if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't.
