 Q.   What pleases you most about the opening round in Portugal?  
MARK TULLO:   Well, the course is playing in great conditions.   I think this afternoon, we got a little lucky because it wasn't as windy as it usually is in the afternoon.   
So we took advantage of it, especially I did.   I'm quite pleased.   I didn't miss too many shots on the back nine.   I came out with some pretty good birdie chances.   It was a good start.   Just the beginning of the week, though, but it was sure good.   
   
 Q.   Race to Dubai, of course we talk so much at this stage of the season, about everybody's different goals and aspirations; what are you aiming for as we near the end of the season?   
MARK TULLO:   Top‑30, getting into The Open for next year, I think that's a good aiming.   Well, that's in the long run.   Obviously if I play good enough, I can aspire for more than that.   But I think it's been a great year, eight Top‑10s this year.   It's been a very consistent year for me, so I'm quite pleased.   No matter what happens, it's been a good year.   
   
 Q.   And does this place give you inspiration, nice weather as you said, beautiful weather and great golf course, great place to be, isn't it?  
MARK TULLO:   Yeah, it's a very good finishing of the year in Europe.   I think this is a very good place for the family to come.   The weather is great.   The facilities are beautiful.   The golf course is in great conditions and the hotel is beautiful, too.   I think this is one of the weeks that we are all looking forward to.
