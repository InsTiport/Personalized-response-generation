Q. Quick question, do you ever relax in the foursomes format?
JACK SINGH BRAR: I think me, no, I've been on the edge the whole time.
Q. So no is your answer?
JACK SINGH BRAR: Yeah.  No.  Because you don't want to let your team down and you just got to do what you can do, but.
SCOTT GREGORY: You can only control what you do.
Q. Scott, how big is it, momentum-wise, for your team to win this point today?
SCOTT GREGORY: I think it's huge.  I know the first one went down heavy, but I think this gives us a nice positive note to have lunch over and hopefully come out strong and get some points on the board for the team.
