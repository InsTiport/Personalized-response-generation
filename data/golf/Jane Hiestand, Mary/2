 Q.  You had to fight for this one.  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: I've had to fight for the last -- this is the third one:  1-up, 1-up, and 1-up, you know.   
 Q.  Tell me about 18.  What happened out there.  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: Well, I actually thought my ball had gone through the green, so I was expecting it.  I was all the way in the back of the green.  I mean, it rocketed out of that rough.   
I wanted to belly a wedge, and he kept saying, Putt it.  I knew it was back up hill and I just didn't hit the one from the fringe.  It was actually in the little grass.   
It's okay.  I hit a terrible putt the next putt.  Terrible.   
So when I hit that shot in here on 19, I was like, Oh, we have to make this.  We had the same line this morning.  We were over on the right.  We had the same line, and, I mean, I knew it broke a lot, and if I could just get it out on the toe of the putter and just let it feed down into the hole I could make that putt.   
 Q.  Tell me what you hit into the green and what your yardage was.  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: Here?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: I was 167 flag -- what did I calculate?  Whatever.  And I hit a 4-rescue.   
 Q.  And it went up there, and I couldn't see exactly.  What were you, about four feet away?  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: No, I was six or seven, yeah.   
 Q.  So you knew that was going to take that nice little right-to-left...  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: Yeah.  I knew if I could get it up there and just let it fall down the fall line that I could make that.   
I mean, this is a putter's course.  That's my favorite club in my bag.   
 Q.  Right.  Obviously McKim had a very disappointing -- she was right there.  Did you think her putt was in on 18?  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I was ready to congratulate her, no question.  When I saw it spin out, I was shocked.   
 Q.  It looked like it was hang on a dimple; was it?  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: Well, when it spun out it was sitting out a long way, yeah.   
 Q.  So how do you --  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: I don't know.   
 Q.  This is your 40th one of these things.  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: No.  It's actually my 43rd.   
 Q.  43rd, sorry.  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: Well, that's because they can't count.  This is my 22nd Mid-Am, not my 20th.  It's my 43rd USGA Championship.   
 Q.  So obviously you've done a few of these.  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: Yeah.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts going into round two of today?  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: I'm just out here having a great time.  I had no expectations coming in.  I came from another tournament, and I just said, I'm going to go there.  I was here in '98 and the golf course was really long for me because it was so wet and we had all that rain.  It was hard for me.   
Now the golf course is firm and fast and it plays like my course.  The greens, I never thought I would be so happy to be back on bermuda grass in my life.   
 Q.  Says the Floridian.  
MARY JANE HIESTAND: Says the Floridian, yeah.
