Q. The figures would suggest a good round?
EMANUELE CANONICA:  Yes I played very well out there today. Actually I've played pretty well all three days but today the difference was I made a few putts where I didn't the other days.  It has been very consistent the past three days and I have actually started to play a little better in the past three or four weeks. I haven't really done anything different with my game, it is just the fact that I have been putting better. That makes a big difference. As well as holing the birdie putts out there, I also holed two or three good ones for par which help keep the round going.
Q. You must have a chance tomorrow?
EMANUELE CANONICA:  Yes I do but I suppose it all depends on what Robert does. He is 19 under par now but he has played fantastic golf all week. If he stays about there I think I'll have a chance tomorrow but if he gets any further in front, then I think I will be one of a few players battling for second spot. But we will see what happens tomorrow and if I can put in a really low score, then you never know.
