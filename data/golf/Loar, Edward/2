Q.  How about your position?
EDWARD LOAR:  I really just stayed out of trouble and stayed out of the bunkers and putted well. Over the last three days I have really taken advantage of most of my opportunities and that's the key to getting into this position. It looks like I got pretty lucky getting Carnoustie on the first day in pretty benign conditions, but that's just the way it is. Like I said, I stayed out of trouble's way.
Q.  You've played a lot in Asia. Slight difference in temperatures here?
EDWARD LOAR:  Yes, without a doubt, but I am from Dallas and it can be pretty windy there as well, although not quite as cold. In actual fact I don't really like it too hot as it can be in Asia, so this isn't too bad - despite the fact that I've got two hats on!  I can stand the cold for one or two weeks. After that I get a little bit jittery.
Q.  Your ambitions?
EDWARD LOAR:  I would jump at the chance to play on The European Tour. I want to keep doing what I'm doing and get a hot start and get into contention, then it should be a great day. It's a pleasure to play these courses. I got into this tournament through the Asian Tour Order of Merit and I love playing in Scotland. I played in the Walker Cup at Nairn in 1999.
