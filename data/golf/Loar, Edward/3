EDWARD LOAR:  Had a couple of three putts but overall very pleased with today. I love it here.
Q.  What brings you here?
EDWARD LOAR:  There are 12 spots from the Asian Tour and I finished 14th last year on the Order of Merit so got in that way. I love it here. I played Walker Cup here in 1999 at Nairn. I played in this last year as well. I also played Palmer Cup here in 1998. I love links golf. In the Walker Cup I played against Simon Dyson and Graham Rankin.
Q.  Pleased with the position?
EDWARD LOAR:  It is so mixed up you just play all three and add it up at the end. That Carnoustie is a tough course but I played nicely and we lucked out with the weather today. It hit us two or three times with a shower but half the time the sun was out.
Q.  Have you got ambitions to play in Europe?
EDWARD LOAR:  Obviously my ambitions are to play the US Tour but if things worked out that I get status over here I would jump at it. I am one only three Americans in the field this week which is neat. This is such a great tournament. You play Carnoustie which is one of the top five courses you will ever play, here is great and St Andrews, you appreciate it for the history. What a place.
Q.  Where are you from?
EDWARD LOAR:  Dallas, so I play a bit in the wind.
Q.  A lot of focus on the American celebrities but not the golfers?
EDWARD LOAR:  There was a big party last night watching Caddieshack which was a lot of fun.
