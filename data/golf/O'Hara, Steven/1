   STEVEN O'HARA: Definitely disappointed with the finish. I had two par fives to come after getting to eight under for the day and for the tournament so I was actually thinking of getting to ten under. Then a wet squall came in and I lost a bit of concentration and made two stupid bogeys and missed a good putt for birdie at the last as well, so it should have been better. 
 I hit it pretty close for the first 15 holes. I shot four over yesterday and it was down to the greens. I putted terrible. Today I got the good greens early and managed to hole some putts. It was very blustery over the putts and I needed to back off some putts and tee shots. It was tricky.
 It's a good position. I will probably be a few back and need to chase and try to make an impact. I just wanted to get back into the tournament.
 Last night I was in bed for 8.30pm again in the spare room and slept through to 5 o'clock. I looked in on my wife and baby and I think she is absolutely shattered. I told her she can get to sleep in the spare room on Sunday night after the tournament is finished.
