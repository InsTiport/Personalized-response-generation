Q.   Brice, you described yesterday's 67 as a stressful round.   What about today's 66? 
BRICE GARNETT:   It was a lot easier.   I hit the driver a lot better and the greens as well.   Still had the putter working which is always nice to see.   The eagle got me off to a good start.

Q.   You had that counter‑balanced putter.   Yesterday was really good, today even better?
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah, I just put it in last week.   Just needed a new look.   Used the same one for years now.   Everything sets up great.   I think it just stabilized my hands a little bit more, and I had a better feel.

Q.   You're in really good shape heading into the weekend.   What's it feel like to be in this position? 
BRICE GARNETT:   Super excited.   I'm just keeping my head down and trying to make as many birdies as possible.   I'm going to try to embrace it this weekend and have fun, and we'll see where we stand come Sunday.

Q.   You grew up in Missouri.   Are you a St. Louis Cardinals fan? 
BRICE GARNETT:   A Royals fan.

Q.   Really, that disappoints Fred Albers on our crew and myself, but we won't hold that against you.   In doing some research, you say lounging is one of your favorite things to do.   Tell us about that?
BRICE GARNETT:   I'm really good at it.   My hometown is about 2,000 people.   I'm still living there.   I just don't know where I want to move yet.   It's just nice to go back and be compressed and do absolutely nothing.   I still play a 9‑hole golf course every day, so I get out there and hit a few balls every once in a while.   But I'm pretty good at laying on the couch and spending some time there.

Q.   I guess that is the plan today? 
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah, it was an early wake‑up call.   It was great to get off first and enjoy some great conditions early.   Maybe hit a few balls here, grab some lunch and definitely call it an early day.

Q.   Brice, an eagle on number one got your day started.   It's been 13 years since someone won in their debut here, but now you're in a position to do that.   What about this golf course fits you? 
BRICE GARNETT:   I think it's a ball striker's golf course.   I handled the ball great this year, but typically that is my strength hitting fairways and greens.   Playing college at St. Joseph's Country Club reminds me of this golf course.   I'm just trying to hit as many greens as possible, and I've had the putter working so far.

Q.   St.   Joseph's in your home state of Missouri?   In terms of your rookie year, you've gotten consistently better including a Top 10 at the Shell Houston Open.   What have you found that's worked for you and made you feel more comfortable on TOUR? 
BRICE GARNETT:   I think each and every week the rookies feel more comfortable.   I know I have.   You just kind of have to embrace the position you're in, have fun, and just keep grinding.   You can't get down on yourself being a rookie.   You may not get into some tournaments that you'd like to, but it's been fun and I'm learning each and every day. 

Q.   Got off to a great start today.   Really good round, we'll get some comments, if we can? 
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah, the eagle at the start was super nice to go ahead and get 2‑under early and know that there is a lot of golf ahead of me to make some more birdies out there.   So I had the putter rolling great the first two days and finally started to hit a few more fairways and greens today.

Q.   You've been consistent 3‑under, 4‑under, you're in the mix every day. 
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah, yesterday the ball striking wasn't nearly as good as it was today.   I had a lot of good par putts and par saves yesterday that kind of kept my round going.   You know, I was happy with how I hit the driver and irons today, so I'm looking forward to it.

Q.   What kind of a putt were you looking at to make the eagle there? 
BRICE GARNETT:   I hit a 3‑iron in there below the hole and had about maybe 20 feet straight up the hill.   So it was a pretty good way and good look to start the day.

Q.   Talk about being in this position.   Not even noon on Friday, and you've got a good number in. 
BRICE GARNETT:   I'm going to keep my routine the same.   I'm going to go hit some balls and grab some lunch and just go back and relax.   Kind of moved up in the category where I'm starting to get early tee times, so I'm getting a feel for it, getting a nice comfort level, and just relax and catch up with some friends back home.

Q.   What would you like to do? 
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah, I'm very good at lounging.   When I take time off (Indiscernible), I'm struggling to get out to the course most days.

Q.   How were the conditions today for you on the course? 
BRICE GARNETT:   Early they were perfect.   There wasn't much wind, the greens were super receptive, and I was the first group out, so the greens were perfect.   Just kind of a nice spot to be in.   It was an early wake‑up call, but you're always kind of excited to get that first tee time.

Q.   Many of your better results this year have come in Texas and even going back to your Web.com days.   Any particular explanation? 
BRICE GARNETT:   They don't take the money from you.   No, I've played a lot of Mini Tour golf in Texas.   For some reason it's just I've kind of adapted to Texas golf.   Growing up back home in the spring and fall it gets pretty windy as well.   I kind of relish whenever the wind blows and kind of got to control your ball.   That is kind of what I strive on as far as my ball striking.

Q.   Had you had any experience at Colonial before? 
BRICE GARNETT:   I haven't.   First time.   I've heard good things and it's living up to everything.   You know, this is pretty cool to walk these fairways that everybody else historically through the game has.   You can just kind of feel an aura about the whole place.   I'm enjoying it so far and look forward to having some friends and family down for the weekend.

Q.   These types of shot maker s traditional layouts suit your game pretty well?   Is this some place you thought you'd have success initially? 
BRICE GARNETT:   I was looking forward to it a lot.   I do like the shape the ball and hit different shots.   Throughout the early part of this year I haven't been there ball striking, but it's starting to come around.   I've been working hard the last two weeks, and I like to keep the ball low.   So hitting little half shots has worked out well this week.

Q.   Do you hit any drivers today? 
BRICE GARNETT:   I hit quite a few.   I didn't hit a lot on the back side today.   I hit some irons and a couple 3‑woods, but, yeah, it sets up good for me.   I like to draw the ball, and I think there are some good draw holes and good aiming targets out there.

Q.   Would you say this course is similar to one you played in college? 
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah.

Q.   What course is that? 
BRICE GARNETT:   It's St. Joseph's Country Club.   I still play there when I get back home a little bit.   You know, it's just very‑‑ it's not as tight, but maybe you kind of work the ball left to right, right to left off the tee and hit different shots.   The par 3s there are all over 200, 230 yards, so it prepared me a lot for out here.

Q.   Number 4's a short one for you then? 
BRICE GARNETT:   I think I snuck out two pars on 4, so that's good.
