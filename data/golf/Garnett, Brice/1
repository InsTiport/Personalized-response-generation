Q. How do you feel?
BRICE GARNETT: Relieved.  It was a fun week, fun day.  Proud of the way I kind of hung in there.  I made a couple of birdies on the back.  And regardless, if I made it on to next week, it's been an awesome year.  I'm happy to have another crack at it next week.
Q. Were you thinking about it before you teed up?
BRICE GARNETT: Not really.  I was just trying to play a good, solid round of golf.  Being under par would probably get me through to next week.  I looked up one time and I was only one shot out of second place.  We're happy to go on.
Q. Brice, going into this week, 81st.  A little nerve wracking out there, 2-under today, 10-under for the tournament.  Talk a little about the emotion and how you managed to keep your focus this week?
BRICE GARNETT: Well, I just free-wheeled it out there all week pretty much.  And had an amazing amount of holes yesterday to get me in the position I needed to be in for today.  And proud of myself the way I hung in there.  I missed one shot there on the 9th and escaped with a bogey.  And a couple of big birdies coming in.  Really excited to get another chance at it.
Q. Currently you're projected at 63rd, so you're in next week.  What does that do for you?  You're obviously coming off a win this season.  That has to feel great.  All these important steps as a young player?
BRICE GARNETT: Yeah, it's been a very blessed year for me.  I've experienced a lot of emotions that a lot of people only hope to experience.  So it's been a lot of fun, maybe not as consistent there in the summer as we hoped, but the winning exemption was nice.  Really excited to go next week.
