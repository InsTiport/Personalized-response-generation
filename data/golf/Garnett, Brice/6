  BRICE GARNETT:   My putter was working the best it has all year.   So if I could just hit some fairways and greens on the backside, I could have added a few more birdies.   But it was the most stressful 3‑under I think I've had as far as playing from the rough and some tough two putts.

Q.   Tell us about No. 5, the really tough par‑4.   It looked like you were headed for maybe a double bogey, and you hit that long putt to save par?
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah, I hit it in a bad spot off the tee.   I think that place is worn out over there and a terrible lay‑up shot.   Just decided to take my medicine with the sand wedge, and somehow ran in a 40‑footer for par, so it was nice.

Q.   What do you think about this course? 
BRICE GARNETT:   Oh, it's great.   It's one of my favorite we've played out here.   It reminds me of my college course at St. George Country Club.   If you can keep the ball in front of you and keep it below the hole out here, you'll have a lot of opportunities to make birdie.

Q.   What is the biggest thing you've learned so far this year on the PGA TOUR? 
BRICE GARNETT:   Patience.   As a rookie, you get tested a lot as far as staying hungry and spending too much time practicing.   I think you know you're going to have a good week, and when you have that week you really have to take advantage of it.
