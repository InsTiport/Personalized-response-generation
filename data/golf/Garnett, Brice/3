Q. Brice, 65 but that was a pretty eventful today.BRICE GARNETT: The driver just got away from me on the back, my last 9 holes.  Made a bunch of putts.  That's always nice to see.Q. You refer to the putts.  I wanted to get to that in a minute.  Nine 3s on the scorecard.  Were you aware of that?BRICE GARNETT: I actually wasn't.  I knew they added up nicely.  I had some 2s yesterday that added up nicely.  I kind of got it going on the front side and stayed out of my own way.  On the backside fought the driver a little bit.  Nothing I can't figure out here.Q. Speak of the putter, 127 feet worth of putts yesterday, 158 today.  What is it about these greens at the Trent Jones course you like?BRICE GARNETT: My speed has been on.  I battled my speed all year.  I putted nice last year and this year is a struggle.  I seen the breaks nice.  The speed is nice.Q. Is that the uptick in the form this week on the putter or are there other elements of the game that are firing better?BRICE GARNETT: The putter.  I'm scoring really well.  My ball-striking stats have been better this year.  Haven't got it in the hole as quick.  Just trying to find the fairway and then attack from there.Q. 8-under.  You're in good shape.  Good luck on the weekend.BRICE GARNETT: Thanks
