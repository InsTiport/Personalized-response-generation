 Q.   Congratulations.   Very nice round today, 65.   Talk about the round.   Start with the front nine, birdies at 1 and 2 and then you closed at 8 and 9 with two more birdies.   
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah, I got it going nice out there early, and hit a couple in there close and got the putter going.   It's nice to have angles around here, and I hit the tee ball nicely today, and I left a lot of full numbers and full angles in.  
   
 Q.   And a couple more birdies on the backside.   
BRICE GARNETT:   Yeah, I hit a couple of nice wedge shots on 13 and 15.   Had a couple of good looks coming in, but 65 around this golf course, I'll take it every time.  
   
 Q.   You're in the top 10 in strokes game putting this week.   Anything in particular you worked on your putting stroke, any changes?  
BRICE GARNETT:   It's been the whole thing this year.   I've hit the ball pretty good, a lot better than last year.   Just haven't got it in the hole as quick.   Just working with my caddie this week a little bit, loosening the grip pressure and hitting the putt, letting it go, and whatever happens, happens.   Made a lot more five‑ and six‑footers this week, and hopefully continue tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts on tomorrow?   We've got rain, going off early, and you're certainly in the mix at 10‑under.   
BRICE GARNETT:   I hope.   I love bad weather.   I'm from Missouri.   
I really do like when it gets windy.   It plays trickier out here when it gets windy.   I like to flight the ball.   And it turns into a ball‑striker's tournament.   I've hit it nicely tee to green here, and hopefully keep it up tomorrow.
