Q.   Tell us a little bit about your round.   2‑under.   Puts you right in the hunt. 
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   I'm just happy I got around under par.   The way it feels, it's tremendous.

Q.   Did you play here two years ago? 
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   Um‑hum.

Q.   What kind of ‑‑
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   It's a good golf course, I think. 

Q.   What was the difference this year?
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   Oh, it's much harder, I mean much firmer everywhere, both greens and fairways. 
It plays shorter, but it plays a lot harder to get it close to the flag.

Q.   A little cooler out than it was two years ago. 
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   I don't remember how warm it was or wasn't.

Q.   It was in the 90s the last three days. 
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   Oh, that's perfect. 

Q.   Anything unusual happen in your round?
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   No.

Q.   Where were your birdies?   Do you recall?
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   6, 9, 11.

Q.   Two bogeys or one double?
ANDERS FORSBRAND:   I 2‑putted, I 3‑putted 4 and had two bunker shots and two putts on 15.
