Q.   Quite an impressive start, especially on the front nine.   Your thoughts on today's round?
BLAYNE BARBER:   Yeah.   I played really well, gave myself a lot of opportunities on the front and was able to make some putts and turn at 5‑under and then kept it going on the back, played really well. 
Probably played tougher because of the wind.   It picked up a little bit.   11, 12, 14, 15 are all into the wind.   So I made a couple bogeys, but I played very well and I'm excited about the start.

Q.   Which were the strengths of your game today?
BLAYNE BARBER:   I putted really well and hit my irons as well.
I struggled a little bit with the driver, had a few good recoveries, but overall just played a good solid round of golf.

Q.   How many putts?
BLAYNE BARBER:   I'm not sure.   It was pretty low.   I mean I made a lot of putts.   Had a couple good up‑and‑downs.

Q.   Any special shots, something special about today?
BLAYNE BARBER:   I was pretty far left on 12.   I thought I might have hit it in the hazard off the tee and then I was just trying to get it back into the center of the green, ended up hitting it to about a foot.   So that was a good birdie.   It's a good hole to pick up a birdie there on 12, but other than that, it was just kind of steady golf.

Q.   How do you think this course suits your game?
BLAYNE BARBER:   I really like it.   It's in great shape.   You kinda just gotta keep it in front of you, hit it in the fairway, hit it in the right spots on the greens and leave yourself good putts so you can score.

Q.   Have you played the Puerto Rico Open before?
BLAYNE BARBER:   This is my first time.   I'm excited.   I'm glad they gave me an opportunity.   I got a sponsor's exemption.   So glad to be here.
