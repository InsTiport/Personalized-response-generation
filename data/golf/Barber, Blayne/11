 Q.  Blayne, we did not see many good scores in the afternoon with the exception of you, birdie on the 18.  Tell me about the round.  
BLAYNE BARBER: It was really good.  That was about as close to perfect a round as I can play outside of two 3-putts.  Just had two kind of long 3-putts.  But other than that, I just hit it really well, controlled my ball well which you have to do in the wind and I got some putts to go in.   
 Q.  We didn't see many putts made in the afternoon.  Did you find the greens choppy at all?  
BLAYNE BARBER: These greens are perfect.  I love putting on bermuda.  It's great to be back in Florida, where I'm from.  There's just so much play on them that in the afternoon, they weren't bumpy as much as kind of crisp and you really had to get your line.  They are still putting great.   
 Q.  Has to be fun to be in contention in your home state and you have a late tee time on Saturday?  
BLAYNE BARBER: It's always good to be in contention, so just adds to it being in Florida.
