 Q.  You closed strong this week, if you could just share some thoughts on the week and how it's been your first time.  
BLAYNE BARBER: My first PLAYERS was a great experience.  A lot of good memories.  I made birdie on 17th last two days both times on the weekend, which was fun.  Just played really well today.  It was a really up-and-down week, the golf course is so demanding and the conditions were really tough.  I made six or eight or I made four doubles and so the momentum was kind of up-and-down.  Then today I just brought it together and stayed patient and had a good round to finish.  So a lot of positives to take from this week.   
 Q.  What's one, if you have one, that was a key takeaway from this week?  
BLAYNE BARBER: Just I'm playing against the best field of the year at THE PLAYERS, in some really difficult firm, fast conditions, with a lot of wind and I was able to battle back after being a few over par and just barely made the cut.  Then had a great weekend and it's a good week.  So just I take a lot from playing against a field like this.   
 Q.  And then talk about what it felt like to have your mom and your wife out there on Mother's Day following you.  
BLAYNE BARBER: Yeah, my mom volunteered this week over in Volunteer Village and this tournament has meant a lot to our family throughout the years.  So having them all here on Mother's Day all my family, siblings, and lots of friends and family from my hometown are here, so a great week, a great way to finish it.
