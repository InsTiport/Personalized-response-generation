 Q.  Blayne, 64 today.  Excellent play.  Just get some comment on your round?  
BLAYNE BARBER: Yeah, really good day today.  Didn't make any bogeys.  Just was in control of my golf ball and made some more mid-range and made a long putt today, so that helps the score out a lot.   
 Q.  On a shorter course like this, what's more important, driving the ball down to the fairway or getting the ball close to the pin on your approach?  
BLAYNE BARBER: Well, I don't think you can do the second unless you hit it in the fairway on this course.  I missed I want to say four or five fairways yesterday and I only hit the green one time, just because I had one with a pitching wedge he could only advance it about 50 yards.   
If you're in the rough it's difficult.  I think it puts a premium on getting it in the fairway.   
 Q.  Can you talk about your 64?  Have you shot lower?  What were you doing so well out there?  What was your best club?  
BLAYNE BARBER: So I think that ties.  I think I shot 64 out here before, par 72.  But my putter was just working well.  Speed was good.  I was hitting a lot good putts.  I probably hit three or four other ones that felt like they could have gone in and they didn't.   
Just a solid day.  Nothing stands out, but it was a good round.
