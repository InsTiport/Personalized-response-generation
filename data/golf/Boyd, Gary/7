  Q. You have played some excellent rounds of golf recently; how good was that one?   
 GARY BOYD: It was scrappy a little bit but I managed to try to keep myself in it kind of around the turn, hit a few loose tee shots, but managed to keep the ball back in play and keep the round going.  
  
  Q. How much of this performance is gained from the confidence you gained last week, finishing second there?  
 GARY BOYD: A lot really. This year I've had quite a few cuts I've missed by a shot, and it's been kind of a frustrating year. And obviously last week kind of didn't really surprise me that I was doing well. Started to hole a few more putts and I've got to try to take it into this week.  
  
  Q. Did you feel really comfortable in the situation you were in last week, because you looked it.   
 GARY BOYD: I've always been comfortable being a person that leads a golf tournament, and that's what we try to play the game of golf for really. All of the practise that I've done over the years almost paid dividends last week. Hopefully we can do it again this weekend.  
  
  Q. First year on tour, obviously your card is safe for next year; how big of a weight off your mind is that?  
 GARY BOYD: A lot. Obviously I'm trying to go out there and enjoy it now.   
 And obviously my next goal is The Race to Dubai which I'm just outside, so hopefully we can have a good weekend here and push on from there.   
  
  Q. You're a great friend of Ian Poulter's; did he offer you any advice in this first year?  
 GARY BOYD: He said just stay patient and do the same things I had done the rest of my career really. Every week we are out here, we learn things and that's what I've tried to do every week. In the end, I think the more experience I get, the better player I will become.
