  GARY BOYD: Obviously only being 1-over with three to play and then making triples kind of made it hard work for tomorrow.   Q.  How did you cope?  GARY BOYD: Just tried to get it out of my system really.  Obviously going to hit a few balls on the range just to loosen down, and tomorrow is another day.   Q.  (Inaudible)?  GARY BOYD: I mean, I drove it pretty well, considering.  We got a little bit unlucky with the wind.  It was definitely into and out of the right going out, and coming in back to the left, so we definitely got screwed over on that one.  But it's disappointing when I had such good preparations going into here and high sort of hopes really.  But obviously like I say, tomorrow is another day, and you never know what tomorrow can bring.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  GARY BOYD: Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I know my game is there underneath obviously what happened today, but I think it's just staying patient out there and taking the chance when you get them.  But it's going to be the same for everyone tomorrow.  I've got a later tee time, so maybe the wind will die down by then, but we'll see what happens.
