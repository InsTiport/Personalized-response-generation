Q.  Two very proud Scots at the moment draped in a couple of flags and an awful lot of support here as well.  Catriona despite the fact that I nearly gave you the afternoon off earlier, it's probably a good job you stayed on.  Have you surprised yourself this week?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I've played a really well this week.  I think I went to sleep a little bit in the middle of the round today.  I've been pleased with how I played.  I kind of holed some key putts which mailed a difference.


Q.  There was one earlier on, was it number 3? 

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   I hold a really good birdie putt on number 3. 


Q.  Two and a half points out of three for you two so far.  What was the key to the chemistry?

JANICE MOODIE:   I don't know.  I think we played amateur golf together.  We know one another well enough and if somebody else is off the hole, we know the other is strong enough to pick it up.  I think that's a big difference.


Q.  Janice, is it important this afternoon that the Europeans didn't do what they did yesterday afternoon and really let an advantage slip?

JANICE MOODIE:   Yeah.  I think Catrin Nilsmark had a great speech and said, "We've got to keep on looking forward and don't look in the rearview mirror".  And I think that's what we did today.  And hopefully we'll get a couple on the back side there and we'll be good for tomorrow.


Q.  It's a pity you can't play together tomorrow.  Have fun.
