JANICE MOODIE:  I played solid.  Obviously I had that double bogey on 7.  That was really my only hiccup.  It was so mentally tough out there because of the wind.  I did really, really well to kind of stay focused, especially through those last few holes. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  Well, you've got the wind and you don't really feel it.  They have two tees.  You know, they used the back one the last two days then switched us to the bottom one.  That's a little bit confusing because you have 30 yards' difference between those bunkers on the left.  I mean, that makes it almost tougher because you can't (inaudible) the wind.  Also you're used to hitting at the bunkers from that back tee.  Now you have to take another line on that tee.  I guess you put it down to not playing the golf course enough to know what it's going to be like. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  Which one was that? 

Q.  (Inaudible). 

JANICE MOODIE:  Yeah, yeah.  It was swirling, as well, a little bit. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  Well, I mean, the thing is, you get 16 into the wind.  That's one tough hole.  You know, I had 132.  7-iron was probably the right club.  But you've got to take another club and knock it down because you know the wind is going to, you know, catch it.  I took a 6-iron.  Then on 17, you almost have to take it - with that pin on the right-hand side - you almost have to take it out onto the water to get it where that pin is.  There's no way you're going to do that.  All the people that are going to hook or draw the ball, the water on the left is coming in the way for them. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  One club less, definitely.  There was no way it was a 5-iron.  One club less.  Then 18, just made sure I aimed it far enough left to let the wind get it. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  I kind of watched it towards the end.  I was too wrapped up in what I was doing to look at what everybody else was doing.  Obviously at 9, there's a big huge scoreboard.  Can't miss it.  Had a peek there.  Maybe on 15 or so.  That was about it. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  We've got to realize that different players play differently.  I cut the ball.  For me, I wouldn't even bring that water into play.  My problem is not hitting it far enough left because I know it's going to go right because I do hit it left to right.  You have the other people like Annika, for instance, hits it right to left.  She almost has to take it out over the water a bit more and hope that it goes right to left. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  Yeah, but the other thing is if she takes it too far left, it goes left, she's in the bunkers. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  Probably.  I can't remember when, but probably.  Last couple, yeah. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  I never had a downhill lie, huh-uh. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  I've got my mum, my dad, my brother, my uncle, who I just met last week, and my mum hadn't seen her brother in 36 years, his girlfriend.  I have people that I stayed with in Orlando for two and a half years, my adopted Florida parents (inaudible).  I have the crew.  My boyfriend was in.  He probably just left on a flight right now.  I had everybody in. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  A lot (laughter). 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  South Africa actually.  Actually from Scotland, moved over.  Hasn't been able to come back over.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  Hotel.

Q.  Where?

JANICE MOODIE:  Maralago and then the Crown Plaza. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  It's amazing how tired you get after the round because the wind and everything's kind of taken out of you a little bit.  (Inaudible) cooked last night.  It wasn't too bad.  We all got in the hot tub, swimming pool, had a good time. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  Three strokes would be a lot to make up.  Because these holes are so severe, you know, those three shots could go in the first couple of holes.  It's just one of those things.  I think you have to take each hole as it comes, each hole as it kind of plays for you or deals you.  For instance, I was at 2-under going into No.  7, suddenly I go back to level par.  That kind of thing can just happen out there that easily.  I jut put it in the water.  You have to take it from the tee and hit over again.  I made par with the second ball. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

JANICE MOODIE:  It's wonderful.  We have our own chalet thing.  We have a huge swimming pool, hot tub, our own house.  We have a nine-foot pool table, as well, in the living room. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  I have a dining room table that sits 12.  Big chairs in the living room. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  With everybody here, yeah.  We have our own little house, yeah. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  Myself, Mhairi and Wendy Doolan.  Juli Inkster is a little subdivision, her nanny is there.  Laura Davies was meant to stay, but she didn't.  There wasn't enough room for her caddy. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  Wendy Doolan was there, Marisa Baena, (inaudible), Sophie.  We had a good time.  A couple of people ended up in the pool with their clothes on, but I'm not going to tell you who. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  That was the other night. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  Relax.  Actually, there's a lot of time off, but then there's not.  The whole of December, I mean, I'm going to be doing some company days and stuff like that.  I mean, you keep organized.  Annika, myself and Emilee Klein are doing a junior clinic in Orlando December 9th.  We're going to stay active with stuff like that. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  Not really, no.  I mean, no.  Be at home.  We never live at home anyway, so it will be nice to stay in one place for more than a week. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  I live in Orlando.  I have a house there.  Three hours up the road.  Actually, just south of Bay Hill, on the same road. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  Just a little bit further south. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JANICE MOODIE:  Turtle Creek.
