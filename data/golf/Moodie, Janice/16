Q.  Janice, would you agree that that was one of the those matches that would have been a little bit of a shame if someone had lost. 

JANICE MOODIE:   Absolutely.  Kelly holed so many or almost holed so many chip shots.  I putted real well.  Beanie played real well.  It was just a great game all around.


Q.  You're playing again this afternoon, aren't you?

JANICE MOODIE:   Yeah. 


Q.  How do you feel about that?

JANICE MOODIE:   I'm up for it.  Absolutely.  Ready to rear and go.  Hopefully my pins of will get me around. 


Q.  Catriona, it's a rest for you this afternoon.  You've certainly played your part so far.  How much have you enjoyed what happened to you?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I've really enjoyed it.  The crowds have been fantastic.  We had a great match this morning.  Maybe a half is a fair result.  But it was a great match.


Q.  How do you see this match in the overall context now that you've finished the morning courses?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   It was a great result for us.  Three and a half, a half is just fantastic.  Obviously a win would have been better, but a half is better than a loss.


Q.  But it's important that we don't get into another situation like yesterday afternoon?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:   Yes.  Hopefully we can win this afternoon as well and put us in a good position for tomorrow.
