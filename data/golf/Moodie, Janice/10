  Q.  The first playoff match of the day and you were the victor; talk about how that feels.   
 JANICE MOODIE:  Real good.  I played real steady, a lot of pars, I had a couple bogeys there at the beginning and then one birdie and then just real solid.   
 I just had a funny feeling that she was going to hole that putt on the last, and you just prepare yourself for the first.  All could I think about is, okay, where is that tee shot going to go while she was over the putt, because I just knew she was going to hole it.   
  
  Q.  Was there a turning point where you thought you were going to win?   
 JANICE MOODIE:  No turning points.  We were just pars the whole way and, you know, it just was one of those Steady Eddy matches apart from the first four holes where we were going back and forth the whole time.   
 No, apart from that, it was Steady Eddy, anyone could have done it.   
  
  Q.  Did you allow yourself to think ahead to tomorrow?   
 JANICE MOODIE:  No.   
  
  Q.  Now are you able to think towards that?   
 JANICE MOODIE:  I'm happy with the way I'm playing -- not that I know of clue, I'm just staying right here.
