Q.  Catriona, how does it feel to put that first point on the board?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  It feels fantastic.  Great feeling.  I was actually just trying to hit a little 2-putt there.  Bonus it went in. 


Q.  You seemed to get a lot of putts out there today.  Was it difficult to get the pace of the greens after that foggy patch?

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  They may be a little bit damp the first couple of holes.  I think we got the pace well.


Q.  Janice, the score line would suspect it was reasonably comfortable.  How comfortable?

JANICE MOODIE:  Not very.  I was over 12 when I had the 5 footer there for birdie.  It managed to drop in there and I think it made the hole look a little bit smaller for Juli.  I think Beanie's hair color is what's inspired me today.


Q.  If you can just nod your head down.

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I can't see it. 


Q.  There's obviously a good atmosphere between you two, a good connection.  Would you hope to play a little bit more this week.

CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Hopefully we might play again tomorrow morning.  But hopefully.


Q.  Another one for the Tartan Army. 

JANICE MOODIE:  Absolutely.  They've all flown over to Sweden just to sample the beer.
