Q.  Janice, congratulations.  How did you feel about taking the responsibility of going up in that first match?

JANICE MOODIE:  I thought I may get a late morning so I could lie in a little bit.  I was up for it.  Catrin knew I was playing well.  I think it was good for me getting those blue numbers up there for the rest of the team to see.


Q.  You got up very well early.  In some ways it's the most difficult thing to actually finish off a going like that?

JANICE MOODIE:  I think that's what match play is all about.  I actually won a couple of holes that Kelli looked as though she should have won.  Towards the end I have to admit the nerves were getting to me.


Q.  It looks as though you were fighting a little pull?

JANICE MOODIE:  I hit one left and I hit one right.  So not really.


Q.  How about your putting, Janice, have you missed one yet this week?

JANICE MOODIE:  I don't think so.  I think you get so focused in the Solheim Cup.  You get so focused on holing the putt.


Q.  Sophie has won hers so that's 11 and a half points?

JANICE MOODIE:  It's looking very good.  But I'm going to be quietly confident. 


Q.  Are you going to go to watch Catriona?

JANICE MOODIE:  Absolutely. All Scots.
