   PAUL CASEY: The scoring was very good considering the way I hit it. Two chip-ins - might make the highlight reel for the one on 17 after almost shanking it off the tee. This is a course you have to get it in play and I really had very little idea where the ball was going. The chipping and putting bailed me out big time. 

 Q. Pete Kostis felt you had your old swing back a year to the day you got injured?
 PAUL CASEY: I have got the old swing back but no clue where it is going to go right now. The power is there and I am releasing it for the first time since over a year now. It is fun but I have to tame it, hit a lot of balls and work out where it will go. It is fun and I think it will come round very quickly but there were some today which went sideways.

 Q. So was today positive?
 PAUL CASEY: Yes. Not out of it and two chip ins, both for par. Some saving putts. It was pretty ugly but I ground it out well. I am happy with that but feel I have a lot to do on the range. 
 It was bittersweet where I felt I was hitting it better but not as much control over it and this is not a course where you can get away with that. I had two chip ins for par so the short game was wonderful but frustrating standing on the tee, looking at a very small target, convinced I am going to hit that target and then it is 30 yards in another direction. That's frustrating.
