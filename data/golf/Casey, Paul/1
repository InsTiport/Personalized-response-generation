  Q. Just a few comments on today.
 PAUL CASEY:   I played much the same as yesterday.  Just shows match play you never know, do you.  Isn't that the case.  Yeah, I'm actually happy with the way I'm playing.  Sometimes you get lucky, and maybe today I got a little bit lucky.  Talor, first time I think I've ever played golf with him.  He's a kid.  He's a lovely player, and he kind of gave me a couple of holes, which was very nice of him.
 Q. Such a difference between the two formats, stroke and match.  You strike me as someone that match play is something that you kind of feed off of to kind of keep your game sharp?
 PAUL CASEY:   I do.  We played an awful lot growing up as kids.  It's basically all we played.  We played a lot of county golf.  County golf was always matches, foursomes in the morning, singles in the afternoon.  That was kind of what we did every weekend.  I mean, I love the format.  Sometimes it can be infuriating, but you can beat anybody on any given day.
 I guess that's fun and that's volatile if you're kind of the underdog, and that can be infuriating if you're the best player in the world.  But that's the way it is.
 I think it's exciting for us.  Hopefully it's exciting for the fans, and it makes a change.  Look, our lives are basically 72-hole stroke play, so in this case it's kind of fun.  It spices it up.
