 Q.  How would you assess your play today?  
PAUL CASEY: It was good. Kudos to Johnny. He knew the number on the 7th hole before the horn -- when the horn went yesterday. And the range, as you know, is exactly the same direction as that 7th hole, so we hit about four or five wedges to the exact yardage to a flag that he'd lasered. And it's amazing what you can do if you have a couple of goes at it, because I stuck it to about three feet. So kudos to him, and I picked the club right this time.   
So it was good stuff. Played really well. Tricky wind, hit a lot of good putts. Not all of them went in, but put myself in a good position.   
 Q.  When you talked about playing a little bit different on Thursday, probably being a little bit more aggressive than you normally would, what's the game plan this afternoon?  
PAUL CASEY: Still the same, only because I'm the total underdog, and the only pressure I've got is the pressure I'm putting on myself. Because even I look at it, and I'm like -- I know J.T. just made a slight error, but last time I looked at it, I've got Brooks, Rory, and Xander -- Xander is a hell of a player ahead of me -- and J.T. right next to me. Even I don't fancy those odds. I've kind of got to do the same, which is fine with me. So as I said, there's no pressure.   
Yeah, I mean, I'll be aggressive. I've got to drive it well. I don't take chances with the drives, per se, but once you're in position, then yeah. A lot of flags that -- you just go flag hunting as best you can.   
 Q.  Does that mentality kind of free you up a little bit just to go play?  
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, Johnny and I have discussed it. We've had -- together we've had a great season this year, so you know, this week was never going to define our season, and the same this afternoon. It's just one round of golf. We're going to go out there, we're going to have a chuckle. We just walked past the scene of the crime on 18 with our mystery club, and enjoy it.   
It looks like a lot of guys -- and I've been here, as you know, a number of times. There can be a lot of stress out there this week. You see guys really grinding and teeing off on Thursday worrying about winning a FedExCup. And that couldn't be kind of any further from the forefront of our sort of -- our decisions and our focus. So we're just going to go out there and, as I said, tear it up if we can. If we don't, it doesn't matter.
