  PAUL CASEY:   I was cracking along, wasn't I.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   I take a lot of‑‑ yeah, a lot of good out of that.   That's the best golf that I've played so far this year.   That front nine was great.   It was wonderful stuff.   I struck the ball well.   And that's really the goal for the day was to go out there and play worry free, just enjoy myself, and I did that.   I soaked up what I thought was a great atmosphere, a lot of support.   I threw some birdies out there, gave people something to cheer about.   And I had a blast.   
So I'm very positive about that, and it shows the golf that I know I'm going to start playing very, very soon.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   My only disappointment is I knocked it in Seve's car park, obviously off the wrong hole.   Yes, correct.   And it's now out of bounds.   And I have to confess, I wasn't aware it was out of bounds.   So I would have enjoyed the challenge.   Now, there were no cars there.   A burger van and a couple of pie stands and an ice cream van or something like that.   I would loved to have carved one around to the green, but I wasn't allowed to, so that was a little disappointment there.   But it wasn't a very good shot, so it is what it is.  
   
 Q.   You found the ball?   
PAUL CASEY:   The ball was fine.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   Internal out of bounds; I've never been a fan of it.  
   
 Q.   Darren Clarkesaid that you were striking the ball much better than you were scoring.   
PAUL CASEY:   In France, yeah.   France was tough.   It was a very difficult setup.   And certainly 16 would be an example of‑‑ 17 would be an example of that today.   I knocked it in Mr. Jones's bunker and walked away with a double.   Just having to play out sideways is never that fun.   And I had a lot of that in France.  
But it's going to‑‑ certainly this week it's going to happen to everybody.   You're going to have to take your medicine and play sideways out of bunkers.   The golfing gods always figure that out eventually.   What did somebody say the other day, karma is the best debt collector in the world.   So keep on smiling, and it is what it is.   
But I was really happy with that today.   And the ball‑striking is coming around really nicely.   I'm feeling really free and hitting it well.   I lost control of it a little bit on the back nine today, but I'm not going to let that put me off.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   There's no pain in the shoulder, no.   No, it's all good.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   No.   I just hit a couple of loose shots.   No, there was no worry about it.   Just a couple of poor shots that crept in and I've sort of‑‑ that's what I've been fighting a little bit the last month or so.   That's all it really was.   And a little bit of a bad bounce here and there.   Clearly the shot on 15 was not a good tee shot whatsoever.   But as I said, it would have been nice to get in there and play it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   Replicate what I did on the front nine today.   Really, I mean, I'm not going to worry about the scores.   To me it's the attitude and the way I conduct myself out there and not putting pressure on myself.   As I just said on radio, I care an awful lot, but I'm not going to worry about it, if that makes sense.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   Yeah, there was a couple‑‑ it was 15.   I just think Seve would have loved to have been given the opportunity to play from the tented village.  
And the other one was the metal railings that are down 18 and the left of 2, let's say.   I guess the rule's different over here from what the guys have been expecting in the States.   You get relief if it's obstructing the swing or the stance but you don't get relief if it's like a line of sight.   So Trevor actually had to cut his ball on 18 because the barriers weren't obstructing the swing, but they were 10 yards in front of him and he felt he couldn't get it over the barrier and straight at the flag.   So we were just trying to clarify the rule, that was all.  
   
 Q.   Were you on the clock today?   
PAUL CASEY:   We were on the clock today, yes.  
   
 Q.   Is that normal?   
PAUL CASEY:   Well, we waited‑‑ Ben Curtis had a very long ruling on the second, and we waited for Krause to move us, Tiger's group, and it was also like McDowell ‑‑ McDowell and those guys were coming through 18.   We had to move a lot of people.   We fell probably seven, eight minutes behind straight off the bat.   Andy McFee jumped straight on it.   We made it up.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   It was great making a push for it.   But when you've got a golf course as difficult as this, it takes time to get around it.  
   
 Q.   How long did you take?  
PAUL CASEY:   Just shy of five hours, I think.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL CASEY:   Correct me if I'm wrong, but the early groups were still 4 hours 20 minutes, groups like Chad Campbell and groups like that.   If they're only beating the time by 10 minutes and they're first out, it highlights the difficulty of the golf course.
