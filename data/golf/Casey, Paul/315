 Q. Talk about the lie in the bunker. 
 PAUL CASEY: It was a really difficult lie. And probably hit a poor bunker shot. And that really was the two poor shots I hit all week. And I walked away with a double there. And then having the ball move on me on the 6th, that was, that took the wind out of my sails, because it was so difficult out there today, everybody's made mistakes as you've seen and bogeys you can handle, doubles, it's like everybody's made one. 
 But to have a golf ball move on you just when I thought, I make a par, right the ship, and end the bogey streak, that was, that's out of your control and that's very difficult to handle. 
 And that kind of threw me for a couple of holes and that was it. Going into the back nine I'm too far back, simple as that. So it's a tough, tough golf course and I guess I broke 80. 

 Q. What do you learn from it and how much stronger do you think ultimately you will be for it?
 PAUL CASEY: As they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I still had a great week. It's very disappointing today and I'll go away and think about this, but I got to take the positives out of it as I always try and do and there was some very, very good golf so far this, that I played this week. 
 Even coming down the stretch there I, I'm not sure anybody will get it that close to 17 pin in two. One of those tasty pins straight down wind and I made birdie there and that made me smile. 
 So it is what it is. It looks like Trevor's going to win this thing, that's great for him and that's going to make me work even harder, because he's one of my mates, and he's one I want to beat.
