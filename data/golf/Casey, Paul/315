  Q. What happened on 16?   
 PAUL CASEY: Misjudged the wind. Greg gave me a number and I had 9-iron in my hand and he convinced me it was a wedge on 16. I'm to blame but I just should have stuck with what I felt it was.   
 So, I struggled out there. I struggled with hayfever, I struggled and I can't see and it just got to me as the round went on. I couldn't see anything. I had him reading putts and I never have him reading putts. Give him credit he made a great read on 17, made up for it. I couldn't see a thing.   
  
  Q. Always a problem?  
 PAUL CASEY: I mean, hence the glasses and stuff, try and soften it you have, but I didn't take any Claritin or whatever substance we're allowed to take, I've got no idea. So that was a mistake by me right there. I was out earlier yesterday and it was pretty good, because we had rain yesterday, so pollen level was down I would say.   
 Tomorrow morning the greens will be great. Looks like the majority of the scores came from the morning anyway. I felt like it was as high as I could have shot with the way I struck it.   
 You know it starts going when the nose on 18 starts dripping.   
 It's not bad. If I take a Claritin or whatever we're allowed to take, I'm absolutely fine.
