 Q.  Ten years away from Ryder Cup, you rejoined the Tour to try to be eligible for the team, you were picked.  You wouldn't have wanted to miss this, would you?  
PAUL CASEY: No -- ask him a question.  Let me get my -- honestly, let me get my breath.   
 Q.  Your first experience of winning a Ryder Cup point.  Describe that experience for us, playing alongside Paul in this atmosphere?  
TYRRELL HATTON: Yeah, it's amazing.  I'm at a loss for words.  It's such a special moment.  Obviously to be here is an honor and then to win a point for the team is very special.  Obviously playing alongside Paul, he's a Ryder Cup legend.  What a player he is.  It was the Casey Express train the front nine.  I was just trying to help out when I could.   
And yeah, he got us going in the match and thankfully we were able to see it through.   
 Q.  Clearly an emotional moment.  What does it mean to you?  
PAUL CASEY: Like you said, it's been ten years.  Desperately wanted to be back on this team because I know how good it is.  I mean, all these guys are amazing, and you know, once you're a Ryder Cupper, you're always a Ryder Cupper.  I can't tell you how proud I am, seriously proud of this guy, as well.  I got going on the front nine, but he was right there to back me up like every great partner does, and making birdies what I wasn't even in the holes.   
But yeah, I can't tell you how good I feel -- just want to make the team, you want to contribute.
