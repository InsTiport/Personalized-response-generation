  Q. Assess your round today.
 PAUL CASEY:   It was a tricky day out there.  It wasn't a bad round of golf.  Made a couple of errors but nothing significant and kind of felt like a lot hanging around.  So the key is I'm not that far away, which is good because the setup was there, it was kind of an interesting setup.  They had a lot of up tees, different pin positions I hadn't seen before and I thought it was quite gettable.  Without wind I think somebody would have gone really low.  So I'm happy I'm not that far back.
 Q. Talk about how you fought back after 5.
 PAUL CASEY:   Yeah, I mean, what else are you going to do (laughing)?  That's a great example that I've never played that hole so sure and misjudged the wind and got it horribly wrong and it's an example that you can rack up some quick numbers around here if you're not careful.
 But four back, played some really good golf after that, didn't necessarily make a lot of birdies, but obviously difficult for everybody because the leaders weren't able to get that far ahead.
 Q. More of a general question.  You won in Dubai and you have a chance to win again.  Obviously you're playing great.  I'm wondering now that you're north of 40 what are you better at than when you were younger?
 PAUL CASEY:   I'm easier on myself.  I enjoy my golf, not as much pressure, I like beating up on the young guys.  Yeah, just kind of let stuff go a little bit.  Like the double today, just kind of let it go much quicker than I would have in the past.
 So, luckily, my physical skills are still allow me to play this game at a top level.  If my -- I still drive the ball great, I'm one of the best iron players out here and if my skills were maybe putting or chipping and I didn't have the ball striking skills then maybe I couldn't still compete.  But I'm in a good spot.  For me it's like, go for it, see how long I can keep going.  How many years that is, three, four, five, ten years, I have no idea, I don't really care but I'm enjoying it right now.
