  Q. Even round for the day, still 7-under for the tournament and two back; thoughts about your round today?   
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, not too sure yet. Started off poorly. Bogeying the first is just criminal. Hit an appalling tee shot off the first.  
 But to be honest the golf course is very difficult this afternoon, the greens were very crusty and fast. I found it difficult to hole putts and apart from Chris Couch, who is on top of the leaderboard, it looked like most of the good scores came from the guys who were the other side of the draw.   
 So, yeah, I thought it was a difficult golf course this afternoon.  
  
  Q. So that being said, any specific changes that you're going to make going into tomorrow?  
 PAUL CASEY: No, I mean, I felt like I hit it pretty good the rest of the round. I had maybe poor speed on the greens, which is why I didn't hole some of the putts I wanted to. That was really my own fault, wasn't striking it particularly well with the putter. But I feel like I'm hitting it good. Just more of the same really, give myself lots of opportunities, and tomorrow the greens will be the same for everybody.
