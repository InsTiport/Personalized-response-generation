   PAUL CASEY: I felt like I hit the ball really well, and I really struggled on the greens. Obviously the card was cleaned up a bit at the end there because I made a couple of putts, but I really enjoyed the golf course. I really like it and can see a way of getting around there and making birdies. I'm happy to be in the position I'm in - not too far back, if the guys don't go crazy coming in. And we'll see what happens going into the weekend.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel going into the weekend? Do you feel you've built some good momentum through your play in the first two days?   
 PAUL CASEY: Oh, yeah. I'm very happy with that. It's nice to be in that sort of position when a lot of putts haven't gone in. But then again, I've hit the ball pretty well tee to green. I couldn't have hit it much better on some of those opening holes. So it's a tradeoff - tomorrow, maybe I don't hit it as good and I make everything. That's the way it goes. I'm enjoying it, and the crowds are great, and as long as it doesn't get too cold and rainy over the weekend, things will be pretty good.
