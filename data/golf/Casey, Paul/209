 Q. (Inaudible.) 
 PAUL CASEY: What was that all about? I think both of us felt frustrated out there. Neither of us made really any putts. I struck the ball very well just never got it going. Made some errors, especially on 17, made a complete botch of that which took it into extra holes. 
 Then he kind of handed it to me on the 9th. So I feel very lucky standing here talking to you about the match.

 Q. How do you approach things technically? Do you take a risk and try to win a hole? Do you wait for a mistake? What? 
 PAUL CASEY: I mean, usually I play the golf course. That is what I was trying to do today, give myself as many opportunities to make birdies as I could. I didn't birdie a single par 5. You know, really I did make a putt on the 12th hole. Apart from that, things like two-putt birdie on 15 really was pretty poor. I didn't feel like changing the game plan and getting ultra aggressive was the key. It worked a little bit on 19. It gave me a much easier look at birdie than Richard had. I need to mix it up and get it going for tomorrow.
