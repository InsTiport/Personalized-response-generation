 Q.  If there was one hole to have a red score on, it's this one.  How did you feel about that performance?  
PAUL CASEY: I feel slightly guilty.  I felt flat all day.  Probably just a bit tired, fatigued.   
Then Russel got very unlucky on 18, hit the tree, into the hazard, made a mess of it.  But I don't care, I feel really guilty but very happy with it.  Now I have got some momentum in my group and build from here.   
 Q.  Of course, to get to that point, you had to make some clutch putts.  This one on 16, talk us through the importance of it.  
PAUL CASEY: Made it to the green in 2, made a mess of it.  I'm a foot outside the right.  I have been putting good.  Having said that, I missed a couple of short ones early in the day.  The greens are so good and this is what match play is all about, making the crucial putts.   
 Q.  You come here after winning the Valspar.  You come here having played some amazing golf coming in.  You said your expectations are slightly lower this week.  Why is that?  
PAUL CASEY: The volatility of match play.  If it's a 72 hole stroke play, my expectations would probably be much higher.  Fatigue after all the travel, don't have Johnny on the bag, golf course is just quirky.  Just dumb it down a bit and then be pleasantly surprised with days like today and then build from there.  It's a lot, seven rounds of golf, seven matches, if you want to go all the way.  Just trying to keep it realistic and not get ahead of myself.   
 Q.  You have had time to reflect on that second win.  It it's been a while on the PGA Tour.  How much more special does that make it?  
PAUL CASEY: I felt like my first victory on the European Tour at Gleneagles, first PGA when I beat Alex Jacob on the last.  It was that good.  My first win, I was like, wow, I have won on tour, this is amazing.  I can't believe it.  Like a dream come true.  The Valspar win felt very much like that.
