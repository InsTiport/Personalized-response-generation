PAUL CASEY: I felt like I should have got more out of it.  Perfect conditions.  The golf course is now soft from the rain we had.  But happy with the way I played.  You can see what's happening out there.  Branden Grace, Dustin Johnson, a lot of great scoring opportunities.  It's a scorer's paradise.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, there was talk that 62 could be on.  Was it Justin Thomas who shot 62 at the U.S. Open, I think?  And first time ever 62 in The Open.  So, yeah, it was on, for sure.  In fact my coach, Peter Costa suggested, why don't you go do it?  Branden Grace has now done it.
Yeah, I knew I had to do something.  It would have been nice to get in the red.  But at least I moved up the leaderboard.  It's such a well-stacked leaderboard.  It feels like I'm too far back.  And you know what a closer Jordan Spieth and these guys are.
Q. How was the house last night?
PAUL CASEY: Quiet.  Quite a lot of cake.  Couple of beers, nothing wild.  Saving the party for next week.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PAUL CASEY: Oh, yeah, many a time.  I've been up close.  We went head to head in the FedExCup, the BMW Championship last year at Crooked Stick.  Dustin and I played really well.  And we separated ourselves in the field.  And we were both 20-something under par.  So I've seen it.  He's got so much fire power.
A great mind.  He doesn't get enough credit for his short game and his attitude on the golf course is really cool.  Flawless.  Just kind of wanders around and looks very casual, but he's a smart golfer.  And I enjoy playing with him.  He's clearly, I think, the world's best player.  I know when Rory gets hot, Rory is amazing.  But right now Dustin is the best player in the world, hands down.  And it's always great to see him when he's flowing nicely.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PAUL CASEY: Dustin always has a swagger.  It's just a Dustin swagger.  It's not more or less.  It's the same swagger if it's double bogey as it is from an eagle.  And that's what is really cool about Dustin Johnson.
Q. (Inaudible.)
PAUL CASEY: What's he on, 3 or 4?  3-under?  There are so many opportunities out there if this little storm kind of stays over there.  I don't see why guys don't keep cracking on and make birdies.  And I think you'll get guys -- a few guys near 6, maybe some guys at 7, maybe even 8.  Jordan, I think maybe he's too far away.  But you would have to do a Branden Grace tomorrow.  But it's just one player in the field.  Mind you, there's a lot of guys capable of shooting.
