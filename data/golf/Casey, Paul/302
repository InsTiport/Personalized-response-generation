 Q. Were there any changes the last couple of holes, wind, conditions? 
 PAUL CASEY: No, no. No, I mean, the golf course, certainly in the last nine holes I felt was very crispy, greens especially. The sixth green out there was toasty. I mean, it's blazed and it's very difficult to get the ball rolling consistently on those greens. 
 But, it's the same for everybody. Certainly the way I found the golf course yesterday morning was perfect, and Steve Stricker has obviously found the same sort of setup. 
 And the afternoon is a different kettle of fish. It's tricky. I had a good putt on 8 and missed the putt for par and the one on 9 jumped, and I've been holing those pretty well this week and that's the different. 

 Q. Are you cognizant of what's going on in Holland on The European Tour, as far as the other guys? Darren Clarke is leading and the plot has thickened. 
 PAUL CASEY: The plot will thicken. We have another week and a half. The plot's going to go all over the place. 
 I am very relaxed. It's Nick's decision, whatever happens. Good for Darren. It was great to see him play well this Akron. I was grouped behind him when he shot a 64, a phenomenal round of golf. 
 The nice thing is we have got plenty of great players who are not in the Ryder Cup Team right now, and we've got a lot of good players in it right now. European golf is very, very strong, and it's great to see Darren playing well, and I've got to worry about myself and continue to play well over here.
