  Q. Talk about your state of play after three rounds.   
 PAUL CASEY: Today was really good on the ball-striking. I struggled with the greens. I didn't read them very well today. So I felt like I left a couple out there. But the golf course once again is firm and fast, probably the last time it's going to be that way before the rain tomorrow.   
 You know, shot 1-under, back in the 60s. I'm not completely out of it, but I would have liked to have been a bit closer.  
  
  Q. What are you going to have to really work on overnight as it were to sort of surge up the leaderboard tomorrow?   
 PAUL CASEY: You know, really the way I struck it today was very good, so I'm not -- you know, depends what the weather brings us tomorrow. Ball-striking, I'd like it to stay the same, I just need a couple more putts going in, and then I think coming down the stretch if I'm within a couple, that would be great. You know, I'm sure the pressure will be there tomorrow for everybody, the guy leading and the guys just behind, and maybe that spices things up a bit.  
  
  Q. You mentioned the word "pressure." How big a factor do you see that being?   
 PAUL CASEY: You just don't know. You know, I think I'm just trying to win a golf tournament, and I'm not trying to worry about the big check at the end of it. You know, we'll have to see. I've got no idea. I mean, I'm far enough back right now, I can be aggressive.   
 If you look at what somebody like Nick Watney did today, sort of down in the field a little bit, probably a little bit more relaxed, let some things go, you can certainly shoot some good numbers out there.   
 If I'm a couple of groups ahead of the final group tomorrow, which it looks like I will be, you know, maybe try and put some pressure on them, let it go, fire at the pins a little bit more.   
 As far as I'm concerned I've got nothing to lose. I mean, walking up the last hole there, the projected FedExCup ranking was about 6th. So I'm top 10 in the tournament, and actually dropping a spot in the FedExCup. So I've got absolutely nothing to lose. I've got to go for it and try and shoot at the flags and shoot lights out.   
  
  Q. If the fairways are damp tomorrow, will that change your shots into the greens at all?  
 PAUL CASEY: No, you could have a situation where you get some wet fliers out of the rough tomorrow, and I think these greens are going to continue to be firm. I don't see how they're going to soften up quickly. I think somebody who puts it in the fairway time after time has got a big advantage tomorrow. This rough is already difficult to get the ball close to the flag from it, so you put a wet flier into the mix, it's going to be near impossible to get on the greens.  
  
  Q. Do you think the scores are going to be higher tomorrow or lower tomorrow?  
 PAUL CASEY: I have no idea. It depends -- I've seen some of the pins, and it looks like the PGA TOUR have gone with the high spots on the golf course to keep us away from any possible flooding we might get with an inch of rain.   
  
  Q. They have SubAir.   
 PAUL CASEY: They do have SubAir. I don't think the greens will be a problem at all. It just might be very difficult to get the ball close. Yeah, we found the dots today. Some of them are on top of slopes and some are tucked in the corners up on high areas. That alone, you know, if you get it wrong, it could be -- yeah, maybe scores will be higher tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You've seen plenty of Jim Furyk over the years. How tough a competitor is he?   
 PAUL CASEY: As tough as it gets. I love playing with Jim. I was looking forward to playing with him yesterday because his focus, his intensity is among the best in the game, and somebody who's won 11, 14, 15, 20 times on TOUR, whatever it's been, knows how to get the golf ball in the hole. You know, Jim is a fun guy, as well. He can tell some good stories on the way around, but his intensity is brilliant. I don't see Jim giving an inch tomorrow. I think everybody is going to have to go get it because I don't think Jim is going to sort of hand it over.
