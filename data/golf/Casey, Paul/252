   PAUL CASEY: Still a long way back, those guys are playing very, very well out in front.  
  
  Q. What was tougher, the change in wind direction or the gusting?  
 PAUL CASEY: Probably the gusting. For some reason there was a lot of holes, we were not quite sure whether it was just helping or hurting, and those are the worst. It was just fierce at times. Very, very difficult to gauge how far the golf ball was going to go.  
 But because it was so fierce, a lot of holes, a lot of holes suddenly became -- I only hit lob-wedge into 18. I've never hit lob-wedge into 18 before. I was actually a bit shocked as to what I needed to do. Very surprised standing there. And on other holes, suddenly became brutal. I could not even reach 13 today with a 3-iron. I ripped a 3-iron. It's only 205 yards to the front. Could not get close with it.
