 Q. How did you play today, Paul?
 PAUL CASEY: A bit frustrated with the game. I think the golf course is there for the taking if you put the ball in the right place. I really struggled a bit the last two days, so other than that it wasn't that bad. 

 Q. Were you struggling with your driving, that's what you were complaining about yesterday. 
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, all the longer stuff, the short irons are not too bad. 

 Q. 2-under going into the weekend, that leaves you in the mix, for sure. 
 PAUL CASEY: In the mix, but not, it's not far enough up that leaderboard. These guys at the top of the leaderboard are playing tremendous golf. 
 The golf course was extremely difficult and I didn't make birdies when I needed to. I just need to bide my time a little bit.
