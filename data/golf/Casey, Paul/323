  Q. That was a pretty solid round.   
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, it was a pretty solid round. No, I hit the ball very nicely. I probably didn't hit it as well as I would really like to in practice and I turned that around today. Ball striking was good. It's extremely difficult out there. I think that's illustrated by 4-under leading.   
 Yeah, I'm happy with that. I mean under par, it would have been very disappointing to not par the last. I hit a very good tee shot and a very good 8-iron, went straight over the flag. I was trying to make birdie and recover the bogey I made on 17.  
  
  Q. Were you not, did you not know that there were trees over there?  
 PAUL CASEY: There didn't used to be trees over there. I said to Craig, it's -- it would have been nice to have even a slight gap where you could have played a nice heroic shot and entertained the crowd. But it is what it is.   
  
  Q. So you took the punishment?  
 PAUL CASEY: I took my punishment and chipped out. That's the only thing you can do now. That's the way this golf course is and it rewards the straight hitter.   
  
  Q. I think one of the great truisms here, is it not, that you can lose it on the first day, but you can't win it. That's probably where you stand at the moment.   
 PAUL CASEY: Very much so. Very much so. There's a long way to go. I shot 78 in the first round before and I had a top-10. So yeah, I pretty much lost it in the first round last year. So under par is fine. Absolutely fine. Three shots off the lead, I'm very happy with that.
