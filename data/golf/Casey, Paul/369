Q.  Paul, one of the world's best players threw everything at you and you posted blue on the board.  How does that feel?
PAUL CASEY:  It feels very good.  I thought -- I played Tiger last time and lost.  I thought Jim could be -- I mean, he's No. 2 or No. 3 in the world right now.  I thought he could be the toughest match out here.  With the numbers he posted, I mean, a fantastic eagle on 16.  I really had to play great stuff, and that's exactly what I did today.
Q.  Tell us about the atmosphere from the players' point of view.
PAUL CASEY:  I've never seen a first tee like it.  It was like a football ground.  Great fans, a lot of chanting going on, but they're very quiet when you go to play.  A lot of support for the Americans out here.  They look like they're having a great time.

It's just been a wonderful atmosphere, very friendly.  They clap no matter who makes a birdie or who makes a putt.  That's the way it should be.  Things are going our way right now, but even if they weren't, we've had a fantastic week anyway.
