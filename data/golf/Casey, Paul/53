Q. Paul, very well done.  We know how emotional you were yesterday.  Getting a half point in that match and then standing there listening to that reception?
PAUL CASEY: The reception was unbelievable.  What a great match.  Brooks won a couple of the majors this year.  He's Player of the Year in my eyes on the PGA TOUR, maybe around the world -- world player of the world.  You got to give it to him.
He threw a lot at me; I threw a lot of him.  It was just a classic match.  You always want a full point.  The half was big for us in momentum.  He wants to win, I want to win, but the half, it was a classic.
Q. It was.  You touched on it yesterday, being back here near the top of order, feeling all this intensity and atmosphere out here, how much does that stir an awful lot inside you?
PAUL CASEY: It stirs an awful lot.  Thomas was toying between Rory and myself for No. 1.  I said I'm not scared, I'll go wherever.  I'm here to do a job.  Honoured to go out No. 2 and very proud to turn that match around and grab the half-point.  That's good momentum for us.  It's just awesome.  Crowd is awesome.  I'm not going to be as teary as yesterday, but it still gets me.  It's great to be part of this.
