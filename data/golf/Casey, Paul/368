Q.  How does it feel to make a hole in one to close out a Ryder Cup match?

DAVID HOWELL:  Nice.

PAUL CASEY:  Nice, yeah, thank you, Howler.  It's unbelievable.  That's my first hole in one in a professional tournament, much less in a Ryder Cup.  It's remarkable.  I mean, we played great golf today, Howler and I, and we had some help from Stewart and Zach, but it was just one of those days in the end.
Q.  Came after a bit of dodgy advice from Woosie, doesn't it?

PAUL CASEY:  One group hasn't come through here, so we don't want to say too much, but Woosie did tell me what the guys hit in front of me, so I picked a different club because I don't think he was right, and it was obviously the perfect club in the end.  I hit 4 iron very, very hard, and watching on the replay only just made it.
Q.  How was it for you, Howler?

DAVID HOWELL:  I quite enjoyed watching that.  What a moment, just wonderful.

You always want to close a match out as soon as you get the first opportunity, and I guess that was probably our first opportunity.  What a wonderful moment.  He's going to go down in history as the first and probably only person to do that.
