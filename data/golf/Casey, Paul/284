  Q. Great recovery from three over after seven?  
 PAUL CASEY: It was a good back nine but the front nine was s**t - can I say that! Can I unquote myself on that!! I think I was in a bit of a daze after seeing Sean O'Hair start with two eagles. That was the most amazing start to a round I've ever seen. It was quality shots as well - great shots into the first and a superb pitch on the second. I have done okay round here but I find this course slightly awkward for some reason. We have a great field and some guys are playing great golf out there because seven under par is very impressive. You can't win it on the first round, you can only lose it and I haven't dug myself into too big a hole which is good. Looks like I am tied with Mr. Woods, which isn't too bad. I have to do something tomorrow though.
