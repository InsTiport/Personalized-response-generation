  Second Round 67. 7-Under. 137 Total

 Q. What 9-under since 12 on yesterday's round; what changed?
 PAUL CASEY: First 12 holes yesterday weren't very good. You know, I think -- I don't know. I can't explain it. Working on some stuff already for next year. Maybe was a little bit cautious going out there. Not aggressive enough. 
 This golf course, I think you've got to fire at the flags. It's very difficult to get close. If you do miss it, you put yourself in some impossible positions. I think just a little bit cautious out of the blocks and corrected it fairly well on the back nine today and continued that today.

 Q. Haven't had a chance to chat with you since the disappointment of missing out on The Ryder Cup; how did you get over that disappointment? 
 PAUL CASEY: Straightaway, actually went and played some golf with some friends at Pine Valley and enjoyed myself and tried not to think about it. You know, I realise, I didn't qualify, simple as that. 
 You know, the blame can only be put on myself. It was tough watching it. The lads played so well. Sunday was exciting and desperately wanted to be a part of that. Certainly stoked the fire and something I don't want to be on the outside ever again. 
 It is what it is. I mean, I got over it. You know, might have taken me a few weeks but over it now.

 Q. Fancy your chances this weekend? 
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, you know, I didn't have a whole lot of confidence when I teed off yesterday, but it's a golf course -- you know, I'm not sure whether I liked it the first time I saw it, but I seem to have played it pretty well in the first two rounds, and I think my game suits it. 
 So, why not? The leaderboard is stacked with Europe's finest. It's going to be a very tough battle this weekend. I'd like to put my name in the mix and see what happens.
