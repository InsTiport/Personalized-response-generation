   PAUL CASEY: I knew a Whisper Rock member would be through to the second round as we are both members of the same club in Scottsdale. It is always tough playing a friend and Aaron is a fantastic competitor. It got a bit shakey at the end. I played great for 16 holes, through in some birdies and eagles, and maybe the jet lag coming from Australia kicked in as I hit a couple of loose shots coming in. But through to the next round so happy about that.

 Q. Matthew Goggin next?
 PAUL CASEY: Nobody should be surprised who gets through and Kenny Perry was the favourite for that match but with the top 64 here they are all great players. I don't think Matthew Goggin will be an easy match at all so regroup and saddle up for tomorrow. Close matches take a bit out of you and you have to save the energy for the long week.

 Q. You live close to here so how does your knowledge of desert courses help?
 PAUL CASEY: It can help. I hit pitching wedge into the first from 165 yards. We are at three thousand feet here and I know what the altitude and the heat does to a golf ball. And the wind, although light can affect the ball a lot. It is difficult to get used to that and I have been doing that for 12 years so should have a bit of advantage over some of the guys.

 Q. One win already - are you expecting you best year ever?
 PAUL CASEY: Can't answer that. I would love to have my best year. I feel good about my game, have put in a lot of hard work so who knows. The goals are the same - the Majors and big stuff. The year got off to a great start with the win in Abu Dhabi so who knows. From the work I am putting in off the course to equipment it is spot on.
