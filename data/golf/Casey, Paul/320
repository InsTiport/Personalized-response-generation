 Q.  You battled well all day but just not to be? 
 PAUL CASEY:  No. He started off really strongly, three birdies on the first three holes to immediately put me three down. I birdied the fourth so at least the 10 & 8 was out of the question!! But he is a very strong player as is proven by where he is in the world rankings and the tournaments that he has won and I didn't make the putts I should have made today, simple as that. I pushed him all the way but they are very difficult pin positions, I will say that. Occasionally when I was close and did have birdie chances, they are difficult to make. I am happy with the way I played, I ground it out. It would have been easy to chuck in the towel after the start but I didn't do that, I'm never going to do that. I had a chance but it just wasn't to be.
