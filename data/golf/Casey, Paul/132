Q. (No Microphone.)
PAUL CASEY: After the eagle on 11, I had a great opportunity on 12, I misread it.  And it sort of petered out a little bit after that, which was really frustrating.
17 and 18 are tough, but, yeah, a bit disappointed, probably wasn't happy after the start, but it was going the right direction, but disappointed after the 11th, that I didn't really get maybe to 7- or 8- or 9-.
Q. What are you doing so well at the moment?  Why is life good?
PAUL CASEY: I'm not overworking, but I've got a good understanding of how my game operates.  I'm hitting it nicely, striking it well, good distance control, putter is feeling okay, it doesn't feel fantastic.  Combine that with not over traveling, took two nice weeks off before Akron, drank a lot of wine.
(Laughter.)  It's a good combination, clearly.
Q. Being on a big stage again, you got a good grouping here with Watson and Furyk, a marquee group.
PAUL CASEY: When I looked at the draw, I go, oh, I'm going to be out driven by 25 yards for the first two days all day.  But I do enjoy it.  Yeah.  I'm normally one to shy away from publicity and just being in the lime light a little bit, but I can't deny that I do enjoy playing --
Q. You play better on big occasions.
PAUL CASEY: I do, yeah.  So that's, yeah, it's been good fun actually playing with those two guys.
