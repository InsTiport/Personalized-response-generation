 Q. You look pretty upset. Tell us what they said inside the trailer. 
 PAUL CASEY: I think I strained an intracostal. I actually did it a couple of weeks ago, a week before the Open, hitting drivers with Kostis. I'm blaming Kostis. 
 I battled through the Open. Haven't done much in a couple weeks, tried to rest it and then tweaked it in the rough on Monday. I've been back in the trailer every day this week trying to get treatment on it, icing it, rolling it off, then hitting some golf balls when we're done, and it just wasn't working. The problem is it's a very difficult one to fix. It takes time to fix it. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 PAUL CASEY: I have no idea. But they said to heal it properly it could be two or four weeks.

 Q. Do you plan on playing next week?
 PAUL CASEY: I've got to be careful because there's a lot of important golf left. You know, FedExCup, Race to Dubai, a lot of big stuff. You know, I was even par for six holes. I wasn't doing too bad. But it just felt so bad. It was fine when I teed off, but as it cooled down -- we've got a cool day in Akron today. And standing on the range when it's nice and warm it's not too bad, but as soon as you get out there and it cools down and you've got to use the rest of the body to get the golf ball moving, it doesn't really feel good.

 Q. What will you do for the next three or four days?
 PAUL CASEY: I'm going to hang around here. I'm going to get as much treatment as I can, you know, and just try and heal the thing. I'm not an expert on it.
