 Q.  65, 7-under, what is it about TPC Boston that you absolutely love?  
PAUL CASEY: There's a lot, actually, considering I was quite non-complimentary about Gil's redo of the 12th.  There's a lot I like about this golf course, I really do.  I think it's just my disappointment because I actually liked the old 12th hole and Gil is a wonderful human being, so don't take that the wrong way, please.   
It tests all facets of the game.  Especially with the green speeds as fast as they are, certainly hit yourself in the right locations to give yourself uphill putts and don't get above it too much.  I'm very, very good at that.   
Greens were impeccable today.  Maybe not so much yesterday with all the play on them and I took advantage of those great greens, which is why you see the score you see today.   
 Q.  Indeed, 25 putts.  What is it specifically that you've been working on that has really led to such a terrific putting round today?  
PAUL CASEY: You know, it's stuff I've been working on since very early this year.  Putting wasn't great the beginning of the season.   
And I think if you tried to separate the statistics and look at it sort of post or from, let's say, Colonial, onwards, since May onwards, my putting's actually very, very good.  Basic stuff:  Setup, grip, ball position, alignment, shaft lead, things like that, I sometimes get too forward with the hands.  Very basic stuff, just trying to roll the golf ball as well as I can, send it online.   
Been working hard with John McLaren, and obviously my coach, Peter Kostis.  I'm just doing the basic stuff.  Even practicing reading greens, believe it or not.  So nothing -- I can't give you any sort of top secret stuff.  It's good, old-fashioned hard work.
