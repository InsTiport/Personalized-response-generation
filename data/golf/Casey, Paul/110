Q. You finished the round with three birdies in a row, obviously you're on a bit of a roll.  Just talk about your day.
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, nice to finish that way, because stayed really patient.  We know what the scoring is around here in the past.  I think the last three years, I want to say it's like 12, 17 and 26 or something like that.  You've got to think it's going to be low, again.
And you know, after kind of making a mess of the third hole, you know, you're 1-over, you're thinking, everybody is going to be like 6-, 7- 10-under par today.  I just stayed patient and luckily it kind of came to me at the end, so it was really nice.
Q. Do you like playing an event where you need to make a lot of birdies?
PAUL CASEY: I do if I make a lot of birdies (laughs).  I do if I like the golf course.  I like this golf course.  It's a fun golf course to play.
Yeah, I know I play really well on tough stuff, as well, but you know, you don't want every week to be a grind.  I really like this.  I like the way they set it up.  Hopefully the sponsors do, too, because we love it.  I think the crowd loves it.
Q. You said before the tournament that you like playing in the heat.  Do you feel like your physical condition gives you an advantage over some guys?  Does that come into play this week?
PAUL CASEY: I think so.  I think so.  I'm not used to the humidity being an Arizona guy, but yeah, I cope with the heat pretty good.  Having lived in the desert for 20 years, I know how to hydrate; I know how to eat.
The aches and pains are not quite as painful when it's hot, as well.  The arthritis and things like that are, you know, yeah, easy to warm up.  You go out there for five minutes and you're ready to go, so I kind of like it.
