   PAUL CASEY:  We dovetailed well. There were very few holes where one of the four of us didn't make a birdie. Justin was the steady one of the group but I did contribute the odd birdie before making that putt on the last for the win.   
 JUSTIN ROSE: You made two great up and downs at 6 and 8 to halve both holes and that's the stuff you need in this format and then, of course, at the last - well, that's an example of coming up  trumps when it was needed.   
 PAUL CASEY: I don't think either of us wanted to go two days without a point on the board. We are too strong for that. We are the highest on the world ranking and we are two guys who should be making points. I am glad we corrected that today. They came at us on the back nine. We were never cruising. You can't ease up against guys of that quality and we had to make some good ones to halve holes and they threw some birdies at us and took us al the way to the last. I am happy with the outcome. We would both have been very disappointed to go for two days without contributing anything to the team cause. We have tied it up and all to play for now.   
 JUSTIN ROSE:  Six birdies on the front nine. If you hit the right shots the birdies are there to be had. I managed to fire on the front nine and Mr. Casey pulled us through at the end.   
 PAUL CASEY:  I hope to be involved tomorrow. Justin is playing great golf and I am sure he will play both matches whatever happens. We have a strong team and being behind has spurred us and kicked the guys into gear. I look forward to tomorrow. I think we are going to add a lot more points to that board.
