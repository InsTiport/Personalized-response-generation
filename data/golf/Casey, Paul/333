   PAUL CASEY:  Little disappointed now looking at the scores. It wasn't that bad a round of golf but everyone is playing fantastic today. Zane Scotland's start was amazing. One par for a 31 on the front nine. Romero is shooting some fantastic golf. It is spectacular golf. I didn't think I would go backwards today with a 68 but I have. 

 Q.  Did you not see it as easy as that? 
 PAUL CASEY:  Clearly I didn't. It looked like the weather was coming in and the wind was stiff at times. I didn't think the leading pack was going to play the golf they have today. I think the conditions were easier this morning. But all credit to them. It means I have to play some spectacular golf tomorrow to try and chase them down. 

 Q.  You still think you have a chance? 
 PAUL CASEY:  I definitely have a chance. I have hit the ball well enough and given myself lots of opportunities. I certainly left a few putts out there today. It is as simple as that. This is a scoring golf course. I know I can challenge the par fives. I got up to the 17th in two today into the wind and not everyone in this field can do that. I have got to use that small advantage and hopefully post a good number in the low to mid 60 to give myself a shout.
