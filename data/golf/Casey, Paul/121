 Q.  It took until Friday to wrap up your first round.  You're the first guy we have gotten to talk to.  What were the conditions like this morning?  
PAUL CASEY: Pretty good, actually.  The course looks damp, but you wouldn't know that we had whatever, nine-tenths of an inch of rain yesterday.  The course is great, the setup is absolutely wonderful, the greens are superb.  It's just a case now you can throw darts.  The fairways play much wider than they have the practice days and you can be very, very aggressive with second shots.  So it's allowing guys to make a lots of putts.   
 Q.  You came up just short last week at the Deutsche Bank, just a great comeback by Rory, but carrying it over to a great start so far this week.  What's been working for you?  
PAUL CASEY: Much the same as last week, hitting a lot of quality shots off the tee, I think this golf course, Pete Dye, everybody knows he likes to play tricks with guys and is a little bit evil at times.  So you got to drive it well.  If you drive it well, it gives you an opportunity to be aggressive with the second shots.  You have to hit a lot of greens in regulation, because the greens are pretty undulated and difficult to read.  And I think that's the key to it.   
 Q.  Kind of like a Rubik's Cube, you solved it so far.  
PAUL CASEY: You know, I never solved the Rubik's Cube.   
(Laughter.)   
 Q.  What do you take positive from last week?  
PAUL CASEY: It was difficult, it was treacherous out there, and I struggled, the whole group I played with, we lacked momentum.  Wanted to get off to a fast start, didn't.  Rory did.  Even he found it incredibly difficult the last nine holes.  And you got an Olympic gold medalist shooting 40 plus on the back nine, it shows how difficult the course was.   
I'm not unhappy, I'm disappointed not to get the win, but Rory's round of golf was absolutely fantastic and that's really what you needed.   
 Q.  Talk about this eagle putt here.  
PAUL CASEY: Very, very straight the last 10 feet, been awhile since I made an eagle.  Luckily, Pete Dye's given us a couple opportunities today or this week to go for par-5s in two.  I really like this golf course, I think a lot of guys get frustrated because it's Pete Dye, but I really like it.
