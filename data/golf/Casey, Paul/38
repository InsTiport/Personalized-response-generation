Q. You came into this week with an awful lot of momentum coming off your back-to-back win at Valspar.  Seems like everything is coming together with your game right now.
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, I've got to think I had a little bit of luck there with Cam three-putting right there.  But I feel really good about the game.  The only thing I'm trying to do is save the energy, because the win last week at Valspar, that was hard work on Sunday.  It took a lot out of us.  Johnny and I were really tired Monday and Tuesday.
I guess the key is play as few holes as possible.  Just trying to do that.
Q. I know you're putting well, but I thought it was a little bit cruel to make that 25-footer on Cam at the 13th.
PAUL CASEY: No, come on.  I three-putted 9 and gave him a hole there.  What a shot that was he hit.  It was unbelievable, wasn't it?  That was a hole I would sit on if I was a fan.  I saw Tiger's hole-out, which was brilliant early.  That was classic old Tiger.  Cam hitting driver up there close.  People coming out here, come sit on that hole because it's entertaining.  Even for us it's entertaining.
Q. I imagine you're going to be very dangerous on the weekend just from a confidence standpoint.
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, I've got nothing to lose.  I'm in a good spot.  I've won.  I know I'm going to Maui.  I'm in a good spot for making The TOUR Championship and trying to win a FedExCup and all those good things.  So I've got nothing to lose.
Finally we're into knockout which is what I actually love.  Win, carry on; lose, go home, which is what it's all about.
