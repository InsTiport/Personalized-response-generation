Q. Your caddie Ken said you played pretty well, last four holes aside?
PAUL CASEY: I did actually, I played really nicely, it just came down to those last four holes. Pulled a bad lie on the par three after missing the green, easy bogey really. 16 was a poor shot, I hit a poor lay up after sticking it in the rough and paid the price, but hit a nice chip to about four feet and, the greens are getting really crusty and it just weaved, simple as that. On 17, the tee shot hit the tree, thought it was going to be in the rough but it hit the tree and I was stuffed and had to chip it out and at the 18th, again, not a disasterous tee shot, just up the right, maybe two yards off the fairway and underneath a tree. Having started off the way I did I really felt I deserved a little more than that. But I'm really left scratching my head about today really, I'm not upset, just a little confused how I managed to shoot 71. But there is still tomorrow and I'll get an earlier tee time and as Langer proved today you can go out on the good greens earlier on, you can go out and post a number, so maybe I can do that.
