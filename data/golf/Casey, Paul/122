Q. Well you got off to a great start, birdied 2 of the first 3 holes as you started on the back-9 at Arnold Palmer Invitational.
PAUL CASEY: The 10th for me today was great.  It's a golf course I love.  I've not necessarily had great results here in the past but I think that the conditions suit my game well and wasn't easy out there so it was nice to get in the mix and move up the leaderboard.
Q. Any particular shots today that make you feel like maybe it's locking in for this week here at this event?
PAUL CASEY: Are you talking about my second shot at 18?
Q. Maybe.
PAUL CASEY: Yeah.  I still thought it wasn't that bad a shot but pitching wedge from 158 or something like that and just lost it right for some reason.  I was aiming 6, 7 feet left of the flag and very fortuitous to hit the rocks, bounce forward on to the back of the green.  Almost made the 3.
Sometimes you need that, you know.  I played Riviera and Honda pretty well, northern Trust and Honda pretty well but felt like nothing was going right.
We tried to get all the bad luck out all those two weeks.  We had a good result the following week at the Cadillac and maybe that luck is continuing.
Q. Isn't it great as a player to be a part of this event with the King driving around in his golf cart and you get a glimpse of him?
PAUL CASEY: I love it.  What he's done for the game of golf, and he's just great still.  It's awesome.  I love that.  That really is the main reason I'm here.  We were so lucky because so many events we can play on the PGA TOUR but there's a reason I play Memorial and Bay Hill, Arnold Palmer because I love playing them and I love this course.
