  Q. Ironic that you should hole the last putt because you had some hard luck.   
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, glad you said that, because that's kind of the way I felt. I didn't really do anything wrong today. It's such a tough golf course, and I've said that all week; that you don't have to do much wrong to get into trouble.   
 And I played a nice, conservative rounds of golf for nine holes, which was sort of the plan and maybe look at the leaderboard and see what I had to do.   
 I'm annoyed at myself because the one error I made was the third shot into the par 5. I had a lob-wedge in my hand and I just quit on it. Didn't hit it hard enough. Tried to get cute with it.   
 That was pretty much what killed it right there, because if I had knocked that one close and made birdie, I would have had a good chance of winning this thing.   
  
  Q. You're very close, you're playing well and striking it well; I guess it's a patience game?  
 PAUL CASEY: It is. These golf courses are so difficult week-in and week-out. It makes you a great golfer, and you've got great fields. So you just have to be very patient, and opportunities come along. I felt that was an opportunity today, and you know, I'm annoyed at myself, probably let it slip by a little bit.   
  
  Q. You won't be aware, on the TV broadcast when you were over that putt on the final green, Faldo said, "Okay, if he makes this, he's in the team." And of course you roll it in and he goes, "Okay, okay, I can't quite make my mind up yet."   
 PAUL CASEY: Oh, we've got on tape; lawyers would have a field day with that one.   
 The Ryder Cup is at the back of my mind right now. I was trying to go out and win a golf tournament today. You know, I'd love to be on that team. Darren has put the cats amongst the pigeons today winning. That was a great win. Went out there from the front, extended the lead. It was impressive stuff.   
 You know, and we've got Poulter, as well, who is just outside. It's going to be retough.  
  
  Q. Don't forget, you have next week, the second PGA TOUR Playoffs event, and you have Boston coming up and that one can do you a lot of good.  
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, it can. I have spoken to Nick. I won't repeat what he said, but I mean, he hasn't told me what he's doing yet. (Laughing) He's keeping his cards close to his chest, and I've just got to continue to focus on my game and play good golf.
