 Q.  A rollercoaster ride - up and down and up and down? But there are lots of birdies to be had out there? 
 PAUL CASEY: I don't know about that! Not sure that many to be had. There are not that many guys under par and the leader is by no means running away with it. I struggled a bit today and found the rough and when you find the rough around this golf course it's very penal and tough to recover from. Always tough to make par as I demonstrated at the last when I made a double. I had no exit and maybe I should have played out backwards from the rough and trees, but it's brutal. However we carry on. I'm even par and not completely out of this thing yet. If I get it going over the weekend we will see what happens. 

 Q.  A good test ahead of next week? 
 PAUL CASEY: We could just stay here and play this course again! This is a major set-up and we could stay and play and it will be a bit cooler than next week. That would be the advantage over it. I think it's fantastic preparation for a Major Championship. It was always a nice location in the season and you felt in the past it was a bit relaxed after a Major Championship but you flip it this side of a Major and it's great. It really is. No better golf course to get your game in shape and be prepared for next week.
