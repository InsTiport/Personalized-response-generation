PAUL CASEY:  Nice finish with two birdies. Halfway through the round when it was raining heavily I thought it was going to be a day when two or three under would be a really good score, so to shoot four under was great. Very happy with 68 for 9-under. The key was to get into position for the weekend. It's a strong looking leaderboard and lots of English guys up there and the scoring is better than I thought it would be.

Some of the greens are rolling better then they look. The staff have done a very good job with them, especially after the weather. It's definitely tougher for the guys later in the round and it's going to be interesting.

Kenny had trouble on the greens -- three putts on the last two holes but the putts were jumping. I watched his putts so I could sympathise. He had a fantastic round of golf going as I could see from his front nine. I am sure he would have loved to swap my finish for his.
