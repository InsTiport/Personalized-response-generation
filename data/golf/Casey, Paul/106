Q. (No Microphone.)
PAUL CASEY: I got lucky to tee off this afternoon, I think it's a huge advantage.  Even though we saw the 5-under come from this morning's wave.  What a golf course.  I mean, it's the best I've ever seen it, it really is.  It's firm, it's fast.  Really happy with the way I played.  I finally made a few putts coming down the stretch.
Q. Talk about the greens at this place.
PAUL CASEY: They are, for a start, they're the best putting surface you're going to see.  I'm not sure, is this a Champion Bermuda we have got on here, is that right?
Q. Tif?
PAUL CASEY: Tif?  It's amazing.  If you can't make putts on this kind of putting surface, then I don't know where you can make putts.  But they're treacherous, they're tricky.  Everybody's probably, who's watched API, is familiar with the putts that Tiger's made over the years on 18.  There's a lot of slope, a lot of speed on these greens.  They're not easy.  But, boy, they're wonderful.
Q. It seems like you're trending right now.  Would you describe your game as that?
PAUL CASEY: I'm not sure what that means.
Q. Kind of moving in the right direction.
PAUL CASEY: Is that a social media thing?
Q. I don't know what it is.  I'm too old.
PAUL CASEY: Yes.
Q. Why so?
PAUL CASEY: Pretty obvious it's going up.  We're getting into the bulk of the season and obviously we're going to get into the Majors that are going to start pretty soon, but a lot of guys are really getting ramped up.  I mean, it's, you know, some guys feel like they're up there in the FedExCup, some guys feel like they're behind, but you know that, from here on out, you're going to get stronger and stronger fields as the year goes on.  The courses will be absolutely prime with, hopefully, wonderful weather around the country, so it's a time to get going.
