PAUL CASEY: Well, obviously disappointed to make an error at the last.  But I gave it a run.  Nice to be back in China and BMW events are always some of the best in the world.  Nice to put in a somewhat strong performance.
Q. There's so much positive on the final day, as well, wasn't there, creeping your name right up there on that board, challenging throughout?
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, it was really good.  Went out, sort of guns blazing, as good as I could.  Yeah, happy with -- came in probably a little bit fatigued and maybe wasn't highly focused, but got quite a lot out of the week and you know, sort of finishes off my season.  I've got one more left before Christmas, but you know, this is the last sort of more official event I'll play this year, and it's been a great year, so nice way to cap it off.
Q. Last hole itself, take it on the chin; tough hole?
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, there was a lot of noise going on back there.
