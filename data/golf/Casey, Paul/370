Q.  Paul, you won a crucial point at Oakland Hills last time.  You've done it again.  What goes through your mind over a putt like that?

PAUL CASEY:  It's nice to have a putt like that.  I thought Robert and I played probably better golf than we played yesterday.  Maybe Robert didn't play as good of golf as he did yesterday, but I really thought we were going to win that one, and when J.J. made what I would describe as a fantastic eagle on 16, he really did play that hole well, and then stuffed it on 17, you know, we had a chance down 18, and I thought that maybe snatching the full point away from them would really sort of hurt.  So that was a goal down the last.

I've played this hole too many times and I've three putted this green too many times to know that he didn't have it in the bag and to know if I made birdie we'd have a chance.
Q.  How are you finding the pressure of your first Ryder Cup?

ROBERT KARLSSON:  I'm enjoying it.  Today I didn't play as well as I did yesterday, so I left myself not enough birdie chances, but it was great to have a partner like Paul on the last hole there.
