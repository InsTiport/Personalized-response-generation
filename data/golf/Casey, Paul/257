  Q. He's got a fantastic record in this event, how good does it feel to see him off?  
 PAUL CASEY: He's also a friend.   
  
  Q. How good does it feel to see him off?  
 PAUL CASEY: He's a wonderful competitor, especially in match play. He's had a very good record in this event, as well. He's been run out before, I think Tiger beat him that year.  
 It was going to be a very close match. It could be the closest match I've had all week. For me this afternoon it's going to be another close match. I think I've got Camilo this afternoon, so we'll see how it goes.  
  
  Q. How does your game feel compared to May of last year?  
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, it's feeling pretty close to where it was just before I got injured, so I'm happy with it. It's way behind on things like Ryder Cup points, but there's a long way to go and hopefully this is a step in the right direction, telling guys I'm back and ready to compete.   
  
  Q. You finished one better than last year, and so far you're on your way, but tell me about the 4-5 and four victories?  
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, I don't know where that came from, I must admit. Faldo suggested I go play the last four holes just to practice yesterday. But if I can, if I can get away with it tomorrow in the final, when I'm forced to play them.   
 I had lofty goals, as you know, but expectations you just don't know coming off the Middle East, very tired. And the game is still kind of working its way back to where I wanted it to be. I think we're very close to where we were right before I injured myself.   
  
  Q. I would think right about now Captain Montgomerie is smiling somewhere, because you and Sergio are three quarters of the Final Four?  
 PAUL CASEY: Yeah, I can't worry about that too much, but I don't really have any Ryder Cup points, at least this is a step in the right direction. I want to be part of that team for me. The Ryder Cups have provided some of my greatest memories, winning and losing. They're great to be a part of. And I want to be part of that team for Wales this year.
