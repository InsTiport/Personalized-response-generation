  Q. Thoughts on the day?  
 PAUL CASEY: I'm just glad Henrik kept his clothes on today!! No, seriously, it was very good today, that's about it. I had a good start and was two under for the first three, which was very nice. I made a very good par save on the 13th because that is one of the world's most awkward par threes! So I was very happy with that and I also made a fantastic par on the 18th, great drive and great second shot because that is just an incredibly difficult par four. So I thought I played the difficult holes well which was the key because if you can do that, that really helps. And then I took advantage of holes like one.  
  
  Q. And you took a fair percentage of chances on the other holes when they presented themselves?  
 PAUL CASEY: Exactly. I hit driver on two, took a bit of a risk there because I haven't done that before but it paid off. It is a golf course I have done okay at, not brilliantly, but I needed to get something going because you look at the leaderboard and see Mickelson at 13 under and that is a very, very impressive score on what is a difficult, tricky, whatever you want to call it type of golf course. One under through one round is not cutting it so to finish on seven under, I'm happy with that.
