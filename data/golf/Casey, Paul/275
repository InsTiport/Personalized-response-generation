 Q. Feeling overall?
 PAUL CASEY: Overall frustrated. I battled the swing a little bit to be honest and ball-striking wasn't quite where I wanted it. Having said that, I did give myself lots of opportunities but it came back to affect me on the closing holes, certainly holes like 16, 3-iron off the tee straight into the bunker is criminal. That's just rubbish. 
 Frustrating, especially the last day, I played the hole pretty well and 3-putted, and only made par. So disappointing I think. 

 Q. You've would be a World Match Play here, obviously this is a different time of year, and a different format; do you play the course very different? 
 PAUL CASEY: I'm trying not to. I know a lot of guys were a lot more aggressive with some of the tee shots in The Match Play, taking driver on holes like 6, for example. I've played it the same way. I may be haven't gone at as many pins I would normally go at, but the game plan stays the same. Things like 3-wood off the 12th to keep it short of the ditches. 
 We hit 5-wood off the 18th today. Just shows how bumpy and firm that fairway is getting, and I don't see any point in trying to be aggressive getting around that corner. 
 Paid off for Ross Fisher. He hit a beautiful drive and stuffed it in there for 12 feet and made eagle. But I've got a game plan and it seems to work pretty well around this place.

 Q. You've won a couple of trophies already, one on this side of the pond, one in America, and you have another in your hand; tell me about this one. 
 PAUL CASEY: I do. The 6-iron on the 10th hole at the Match Play against Geoff Ogilvy in the final, about 200 yards or something like that, holed that one, won hole, went on to lose the match. So it's little bit bittersweet winning this thing and losing the match, but it's been a pretty good season so far.
