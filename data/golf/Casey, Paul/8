  Q. It was certainly blowing out there.  Tell us your reflections on today's round?
 PAUL CASEY:   That's a difficult golf course right there.  I'm not sure what course David Horsey was playing, but it wasn't the same golf course I was on.  I mean, my playing partners, Bob and G-Mac, we genuinely struggled.  We found that very difficult.  It's a great golf course.  It's a hell of a test.  But I'm just happy to get through under par.
 Q. Seeing what Horsey did this morning and knowing you were going out to the tougher half of the draw, did you still feel pressure to try and find a low one?
 PAUL CASEY:   Yes and no.  I mean, I think -- I don't know, we can figure out the statistics, but it's probably a couple of shots harder.  So 1-under is like a 3-under, and you look at guys 3-under, Dustin and things like that.
 I'm not unhappy.  You just have to stay in touch.  The key now is to make hay tomorrow because we don't know because we have maybe some rain coming in.  I think with the conditions it always seems to be that way.
 Playing with G-Mac, defending champion, he said that's just they with it is around here.  I'm not unhappy with today's performance.  Just go out there and try and smash it tomorrow.
 Q. Coming off last week, you haven't had much time to recharge.  Where are the general energy levels?
 PAUL CASEY:   They are all right.  Poor Johnny -- I was in every single bunker, and Johnny had to rake every single bunker.  Johnny is probably exhausted today.
 I feel good.  I've not typically been one of those guys who sort of follows up the following week, sort of win, win.  But I'd love to change that pattern if I can.
 Pretty good.  Great thing is, it's not that far from last week to here, so time difference and all the rest is really not an issue.  And there wasn't much celebrating last week, anyway, because we're still in a bubble.  So I have no excuses, have I.
