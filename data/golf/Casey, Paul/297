 Q. Paul, obviously disappointing. What are your thoughts on the first match?
 PAUL CASEY: I'm disappointed in the way I played. We just made too many mistakes between the two of us. We got off to a great start. I hit a great tee shot down the 1st and I thought that was going to set the tone. We had some great fans on the first tee. They were hysterical. They had a lot of chants going. 
 You know, we got some birdies thrown at us after being 2-up. They birdied three in a row, and they gave us one back, and then we gave them a couple, and that was it. You can't give anything away in this. So I'm disappointed with that. 

 Q. When did it really become apparent that it wasn't working for you then? 
 PAUL CASEY: I mean, we sort of got into a little bit of trouble on the 7th down the par-5. I hit a poor tee shot and then didn't catch a very good lie for the third shot, just fell short and went into the water there on the par-5. 
 You know, we missed the green on the short par-3, and having floored one back on 10 there with a really good birdie, not making putts on the next couple of holes, chances there -- I thought the putt on 13, it was a fantastic putt. I mean, we just had information from OlazÃ¡bal that that putt broke more than guys thought. Padraig and Robert Karlsson had said that putt broke more than they thought. 
 So I hit a great putt. It was actually inside the hole and went the other way up the hill. That was probably a really key turning point because Hunter hit a wonderful tee shot on 14 and stuffed it there, and that pretty much was the nail in the coffin.
