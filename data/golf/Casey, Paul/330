   PAUL CASEY:  I think it's okay after two rounds. Very difficult to tell what the winning score is going to be. Graeme played a fantastic round of golf yesterday, bogey free, and made it look as if the winning score would be in double digits, but I don't think it's going to be. It's too tough a course and I've got to get myself back under par and if I can do that I think I will be in contention for the weekend. 
 It could have been lower today. The greens are much better and hopefully the afternoon guys will find it tough. If you can find the right side of the pins you can score out there and it's beautifully set up and if you strike it well you will score well. If I can get better every day and score under par that will be fine. I worked with Peter this week and just kept my swing in check. Today my iron play - mid iron play - was pretty good. There were some four or five irons I hit which were good and gave me lots of opportunities.
