Q. What is it about you and this format that you are so confident?
PAUL CASEY: I can make horrific scores and get away with it like I did last week.  Well, I didn't get away with it last week.  It rewards aggressive play.  It rewards guys who take chances.  At the same time, you've got to be consistent.
I grew up playing I like it.  I like it.  It's the pure form of the sport.
Q. Paul, your match play record speaks for itself.  Really you had to rally late to get it done.
PAUL CASEY: I mean, no easy groups.  Joost is a good player.  He wasn't necessarily on his game today, gave me a couple opportunities, couple of chances.  I played really well.  I think the key was I putted much better than I have been in past weeks.  I feel like that's really coming around.  I love this format.  I think it's cool.  We grew up playing a lot of match play.  All the British kids know how to play it well.  It doesn't mean anything, but at least we know how to play it.
I haven't played match play since this time last year.  So I kind of -- I'm hungry for this one.
