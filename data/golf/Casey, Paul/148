Q.   Okay.   Paul, 4-under 68.   That's two 68s and a 69 in three days.   Very steady play.
PAUL CASEY:   Thank you.   Yeah, I played -- today was the toughest day I think I ever had out there.   Certainly the toughest day for me with a different wind.   It was cooler, golf course played much, much longer with that direction today.   I played brilliant on the front side.   The first -- really the first kind -- I played really good all the way through.   It was just a couple of loose swings coming in that cost me a dropped shot on 17, but I played wonderful.   Very, very happy with it, with where I stand in the tournament.

Q.   Was the direction of the wind the big problem or the velocity?
PAUL CASEY:   Direction of the wind.   I'm not good on directions.   I think it was north something and we've had a south something.   All I know is that holes like 8 played downwind and today they were sort of straight into.   So, basically the golf course has gone from playing a lot of holes downwind, seeing a lot of holes into the wind.   With as much water as you've got out there, putting a premium on having to hit the fairways made it very difficult.

Q.   You look like you're having fun out there?
PAUL CASEY:   I'm having a great time.   I love being in Houston.   It's wonderful to be back, you know.   I love the crowds here.   I love the golf course golf course, obviously.   It has a special place in my heart.   I'm really happy with the way I'm playing.   I'm excited to be in next week, back into the Masters.   You know, part of me is getting ready for that, but I'm not taking away and I'm not ignoring the fact that I've got an opportunity to win a golf tournament this week.   Might be a little bit behind with the finish and guys like Jordan shooting up the leaderboard, but I still have to give myself an outside chance of winning this thing tomorrow.
