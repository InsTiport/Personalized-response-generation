 Q.  Good start, eagle 2.  
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, got lucky on what is that, the 14th.  Yeah, 14, actually a poor drive in the right-hand bunker.  I had 149 yards and slam dunked the 8-iron.   
So yeah, great way to sort of get the round going, and some birdies really to start it off.  That was the icing on the cake for my first nine.  It didn't really get much better after that but it's certainly a highlight.   
 Q.  I appreciate it's only the first day but sometimes you look for omens and that little bit of luck, don't you, so given the start that you had, that's terrific.  
PAUL CASEY: It was great.  It's nice to get off to a good start.  Feeling a little bit weary and beaten up.  It wasn't my best today, ball-striking was a little bit off.  So to shoot 5-under, I'm ecstatic with that.   
Actually did a lot of things right.  Managed myself well considering I wasn't hitting it brilliantly, and the eagle maybe sort of, you know, hides the true tale that sort of I was painting out there.   
But it's great.  Guys look like they are tearing up the golf course.  Conditions are absolutely perfect out there for going low:  Sticky, damp, probably favours the longer guys, so it's nice to stay in touch.   
 Q.  Weary and beaten up, because?  
PAUL CASEY: Long year.  Again, I've played a lot of golf.  Nothing more than that.   
 Q.  Good year, though, isn't it?  
PAUL CASEY: Yeah, it's been a great year.  I lovely.  I'd like to say that parenting is making me -- fewer hours in bed, but it's been great.  Great to play wonderful golf.  Been extremely happy off the golf course, as well, so I'm in a really good place.   
Maybe that's a little unfair, tired and weary, but I'm just not as young as I used to be.  Although you called me a young man a minute ago; getting on an airplane and flying around the planet, I'm not quite as good as I used to be.   
 Q.  We are always looking and seeing what you're doing on the other side of the pond, of course but we miss you.  Any European Tour future?  
PAUL CASEY: Still to be decided.  I think Mr. Pelley has got some announcements to make, and I watch with intrigue as most of the other guys do, as well, to see what gets announced.  Unfortunately I don't have any insight.   
And you know, I spent time with him.  I think he's great.  I think he's, from what I've seen and what we've discussed, I think he's going to be a fantastic CEO.  He's got a huge amount of energy.  Tough task that he's taking on, because obviously sort of downturn in economies and maybe not the growth of the game that was expected in certain regions.   
So he's got his work cut out, but I think from what I've seen, I think he's grabbed the bull by the horns and he's got some exciting plans.  It would be nice to be part of it.
