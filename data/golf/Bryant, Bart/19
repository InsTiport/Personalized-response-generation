 Q.  On the round? 
 BART BRYANT:  I felt like 72 was a good solid round.  I made some good up-and-downs.  It was a fairly consistent day and I felt like I managed my round real well. 
 I was one of the last ones to play in the par-3 yesterday.  And then I could tell how much firmer it was getting.  So at that point I thought par would be a pretty good score. 
 If the conditions stay like this and we get no moisture or they don't water, it will be extremely difficult.  It all depends on what they do on water.  Management will determine the golf course.  It could get really firm. 
 The thing is, I'm not a great spinner of the ball, so I have to rely more on my bump and run. 
 There are just no easy holes out there.
