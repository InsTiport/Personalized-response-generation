 Q.  Started the day with a 5-under, you know, good way to start the opening round? 
 BART BRYANT:  Absolutely.  I really felt like with the cool weather and a little breeze blowing when I teed off this morning, I really felt like if you could get it 2- or 3-under, that would really keep you in the golf tournament.  So to go ahead and get it to 5 feels like a little bonus actually. 

 Q.  How were the weather conditions out there today? 
 BART BRYANT:  It wasn't terrible.  It was funny, at some times it would almost warm up, but then as soon as you'd take your jacket off you'd have to put it right back on. 
 But scoring conditions were not as great as they usually are here, but having said that, they weren't terrible. 

 Q.  Do you expect conditions to change so people will go lower this afternoon and the rest of the weekend? 
 BART BRYANT:  I don't know.  It's funny, but it doesn't seem like it's trying to warm up all that much.  I don't know if the weather is going to break this afternoon or not, but I definitely expect the weather to get better towards the weekend, and scores are going to be good. 
 Of course, having said that, the greens will firm up a little bit, as well, which can make it play a little tougher.  They're awfully soft out there right now.  But I think overall you're probably going to see scores go down as the weather gets good. 

 Q.  How about your game coming into today, and today how do you feel with where you're at? 
 BART BRYANT:  I feel pretty good about my game.  I'm just playing solid.  I'm not doing anything extraordinary, but I'm doing everything pretty well, so I feel like I'm right where I need to be.
