BART BRYANT: I mean, it's a totally different course.  It was going to play really long today.  Obviously, compared, because it was firm.  But they did move some of the tees up for us because it was so wet.  That kept the course from playing too long.
You could fire at the pins.  Obviously, the greens got really firm Friday afternoon.  Even Saturday they were -- it was hard to keep them on the greens at times.  Today, you're hitting 4 irons right at the pin, not even thinking about it.  So it was a different golf course.  It was very gettable.  It wouldn't surprise me if someone would shoot 5 or 6 under today.  It's out there for someone to get for sure.
Q. Does it make it more enjoyable?
BART BRYANT: I don't know.  I mean, you're out there competing.  The nice thing is everybody's competing under the same conditions.  I think the first, Thursday and Friday, those afternoons got pretty tough.  I played Friday afternoon, and it was -- couldn't hardly keep the ball on the greens.  But I know the guys Thursday afternoon had that too.
Q. Today, we're all competing under the same conditions, the same amount of wind, the same amount of softness.
