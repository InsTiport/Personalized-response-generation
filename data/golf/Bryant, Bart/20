 Q.  I know you're disappointed that you didn't get the win, but you've got to be really encouraged the way that you played. 
 BART BRYANT:  Yeah, I'm encouraged with the way that I played.  I started off great today.  I had an opportunity to get the job done, and honestly I just did not hit the ball well enough today to win. 
 My putter really helped me out.  I putted great.  I missed one on the last hole, but that was a little bit after the fact. 
 But I made some great putts.  Just for some reason I just felt comfortable over the ball today with my irons, and because of that I didn't have a lot of really close birdie putts and left myself in a couple awkward positions. 

 Q.  It looked like you were putting a lot of pressure on Quinney early.  Did you look at the leaderboard to see?  You were going pretty deep there on the front nine. 
 BART BRYANT:  Yeah, I mean, I was 5-under through the first seven holes, I believe.  I mean, he probably looked up there and saw that.  I was thinking that probably someone in our group would have to put some pressure on him early.  But having said that, I mean, we did put some pressure on him, and he handled it well.  He's playing great.  Looks like he's probably going to get the job done, so hats off to him. 

 Q.  You played great this week.  Thanks a lot for hanging out with us and have a great rest of the year. 
 BART BRYANT:  Thanks.
