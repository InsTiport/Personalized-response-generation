Q.   Another solid round. 
BART BRYANT:   It ended up being a pretty decent score.   I was on Mr.Toad's Wild Ride early.   I think I had four bogeys in the first seven holes. 
But I held it together and played some solid golf coming in.   I was hoping that I could just hang on and I wouldn't have to go real low today.   Fortunately, it looks like the only guy who was going to go low was Marco, and he was a ways back. 
So I don't think I shot myself out of the tournament.   I think I can make a pretty good run at it tomorrow.

Q.   How does that feel being in contention going into Sunday and have a shot at a Major Championship?
BART BRYANT:   Well, it feels good.   It's probably uncharted territory for me.   On the PGA TOUR I never came close to have a chance to win a Major.   So this is pretty cool.   I'll definitely relish it, I'll enjoy it and we'll just kind of, the chips will fall where they will and I'm just going to try to play a real solid round tomorrow. 

Q.   What kind of works for you during around when you are struggling to sort of get yourself back on track?
BART BRYANT:   It's different things, but I don't know if it was a little bit mental starting out today or exactly what, I had my back worked on pretty seriously this morning for a couple hours before I teed off, and I don't know if that just felt a little bit different teeing off or what, but I hits some very bad shots to the right early with some irons and it put me in some bad positions and just got me a little rattled and luckily I just was able to calm down and start hitting some good shots.
