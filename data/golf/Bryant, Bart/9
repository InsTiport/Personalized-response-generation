 Q.   You bogeyed 18, but still a share of the lead heading into the weekend at a Major Championship.   How does this feel?  
BART BRYANT:   It feels good.   I played well both days, I just couldn't get it in the hole yesterday, I missed a few putts I should have made.   But today I putted better, I played well, I just made a couple of small mistakes, but other than that it was very solid.  
   
 Q.   To be in position now to have a shot at a Major Championship, talk about that aspect and what you now have to do.   
BART BRYANT:   Well, it feels good to have a shot at a Major Championship.   These are pretty big for us.   
But we're only halfway through, there's a long way to go.   So I'm going to have to play a good solid round tomorrow.   I need to get 3‑, 4‑ or 5‑under tomorrow to probably have position for Sunday.   I think there really hasn't been a low score shot out here yet this week and I looked ‑‑ although it is my first time ‑‑ I did look at the scores from two years ago and it looked like on the weekend there were some very low scores shot.   
So I'm anticipating that someone is going to fire it up.   So to have a chance, it's probably going to take at least one low round in the next two days.  
   
 Q.   Are you obviously having a death in the family, is it a little bit more emotional on the golf course this week for you?  
BART BRYANT:   A little bit.   I have to admit there were several times in the last two days that my dad's passing entered my mind and I teared up a little bit at times.   And then I had to kind of get back to the task at hand, but he was a great man, we're going to miss him, but he's in a much better place.
