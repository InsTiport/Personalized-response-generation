Q.   I hate to make a Disney reference, but since that's where your brother won, is there something magical going on for you this week here?
BART BRYANT:  I think there may be.  The jury is still out on that.  We've got another day to go.  If I come out on top I think we can say something magical happened.  So far it's been a lot of fun, and certainly there's been a couple of magic spots, for sure.
Q.  So Sunday it's going to be Bart Bryant, then Retief Goosen and Tiger Woods.  How are you going to do it?
BART BRYANT:  I hope to do really well, but your guess is as good as mine.  I'm going to try to get some good rest tonight and come out tomorrow and stick with the same game plan, try and get it in the fairway.  I think if I continue to do that, I have a decent chance to coming out on top, but I'll have to keep the ball in the short grass.
