  Q.  Talk a little bit about your play today.   
 BART BRYANT:  I played well.  My short game has been great the last two days.  I haven't hit the ball particularly great, but I kind of bailed myself out a few times with my short game, made some really nice putts, and that's why I'm 10-under right now.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the course and how it played.   
 BART BRYANT:  The course is playing great.  The greens are a little bit soft from the rain we had on Tuesday and Wednesday, so unless the greens firm up over the weekend I'm sure we're going to see some more low scores.   
  
  Q.  It's good to finish with a birdie on the last hole?   
 BART BRYANT:  No doubt.  That's always good.   
  
  Q.  Talk about tomorrow, playing in the final group.   
 BART BRYANT:  Yeah, looks like I might have a chance to get in the final group, which is always good.   
 Yeah, I think anybody at 8-, 9-, 10-under has a chance right now.  I know Jeff is at 13-under, but unless he just really runs off and leaves everybody, I think all those guys at 8, 9, 10 still have a great chance of winning if they play good on the weekend.
