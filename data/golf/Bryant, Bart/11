 Q.   Just start with, can you tell me a little bit about your round today?  
BART BRYANT:   Oh, I played a pretty solid round.   Unfortunately, I bogeyed the last two holes.   My putter was really balky today.   I did make one long putt on No. 9, but other than that I really struggled.   So I had an opportunity to kind of get back in the tournament and just kind of shot myself in the foot, unfortunately, coming in.   
   
 Q.   I know you had a stretch there where you had four birdies in five holes.   What was kind of really your strength during that stretch?  
BART BRYANT:   I hit it solid gave myself good looks, I was on the right side of the hole to have opportunities.   And I just had one little stretch there where the putter worked okay for me and it got me healthy quick.   
And then I just couldn't get it to the house.   I hit some close ones, I couldn't make them.   And then the last two holes I just threw up on myself, so, you know, sometimes that happens.   
   
 Q.   And then final question, how did the course play compared to yesterday?  
BART BRYANT:   I'm guessing you're going to find it pretty similar as far as scores go.   Obviously it's starting to firm up a little bit.   Ball's releasing just a little bit more, which is nice.   
If it continues to be like this Sunday, we may get those firm conditions I'm sure they were hoping for.   But the course is still fairly benign for a Major.   I'm expecting it's going to firm up and the greens are going to get faster.
