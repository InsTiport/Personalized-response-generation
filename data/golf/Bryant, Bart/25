THE MODERATOR:  Pretty nice round for you today.  Can you talk about that.
BART BRYANT:  Thank you.  Yeah, it really was.  I just played solid all day and then birdied the last three, which turned a good round into a great round.
Q.
Talk about the conditions and how the weather may have affected or may have helped you?
BART BRYANT:  Weather conditions were pretty good for scoring today.  May have been a little cool and looked dreary out there, it was really good golfing weather because the wind didn't blow hard and the greens stayed pretty soft all day.
Q.
Were you doing much scoreboard watching today?
BART BRYANT:  Yeah.  I actually looked at it that Back 9 kind of seeing where everybody was.  I thought if I birdied that last hole I might have an outside chance of getting in that last group.  I doubt it.

But it definitely put me in position where if I go out a shoot a real low round tomorrow I might have a chance to win.
