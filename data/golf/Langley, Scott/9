 Q.   Scott, in these windy, kind of cool conditions, how good is that round for you?  
SCOTT LANGLEY:   It is really good.   I'll definitely take it.   It was a tough day.   You don't get a lot of easy days at Hilton Head.   This was a tough one, for sure.  
I was able to control my ball pretty well.   And made a few really nice putts that gave me a lot of momentum.   It's kind of a bonus to make some of these 30, 40‑foot putts.   And I was able to do it once, and had a couple of really close ones.   It was a really solid day.  
   
 Q.   What is it about courses like Harbour Town, Innisbrook, Waialae in Hawaii that you love so much?  
SCOTT LANGLEY:   I think I just like courses that don't favor any one player.   Those all kind of fall into that category.   For me I enjoy a course that you have to plot your way around a little bit, you can't just smash it and chop it out of the rough, get it up on the green and have a birdie putt.   Around here you have to manage it really well and kind of think your way around more than other places.   
So I enjoy this style of golf.   You come to venues throughout the year and you kind of grow to love certain places, and this is certainly one of those places for me.  
   
 Q.   Does your lower‑trajectory ball flight help you in these conditions, do you think?  
SCOTT LANGLEY:   It's funny, I've been working on hitting it a lot higher this year.   And the last six tournaments I've played have been super windy, of course.   I'm hitting it higher, but I still have the low shot in me, which is nice.   The high‑ball flight for me now helps me stop it a little easier downwind.   And then it's nice to still have that low, kind of stinger 3‑wood off the tee, I guess, if you can call it that.   But that's a shot that I can control pretty well and I rely on it on a course like this.
