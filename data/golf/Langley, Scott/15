Q.   Off to not a bad start, and then you made the turn and just came out firing.   Talk a little bit about that round? 
SCOTT LANGLEY:   Yeah, just the key to my round today was really good iron play for the most part.   I gave myself a lot of kick‑ins, really.   I hit it to three, four, five feet a few times, and those are kind of bonuses a little bit sometimes.   But I tell you, it was nice playing a little softer greens than last week.   It felt a little more receptive.   I don't know if easy is the right word, but it was nice to see the ball stop where I landed it, and made me feel like I could get a little more aggressive and get a few more flags.   But, yeah, just really solid iron play.   I was really pleased with that. 
And just solid, short putting.   Felt good about my putting.   Didn't feel like I left a ton out there.   I would have liked to have gotten a few birdie putts on the last few holes to the hole to at least give them a chance, but 6‑under is never a bad score.   I'll take it every day.
