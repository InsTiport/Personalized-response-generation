 Q.  Scott let's talk about what was a terrific day, maybe the best you've had all year on the PGA TOUR.  How good did that feel?  
SCOTT LANGLEY: Great.  Nice to shoot a low score.  My game has been kind of up and down a little bit this year and, you know, I kind of told myself a couple weeks ago it's been a struggle but no matter what happens these next two months, if I'm in the FedExCup, if I'm in the Web.com Finals, I just want to build good momentum.  Today was a big step in that direction.  So, really happy with the score.   
 Q.  Your iron play was so good.  16 you caught a bad break, the par 3.  Hit the stick and it kind of ricochets off.  At 18 out of the rough up to four feet.  Great shot.  
SCOTT LANGLEY: Yeah.  18 is normally pretty tough for me just coming off a down slope to an elevated green.  It's never an easy shot.  And, fortunately, I had a good lie and had a good number and I just stayed aggressive and made a good swing and came out pretty much perfect to land just on the front and trickle up underneath the hole.  You couldn't ask for a better result.   
 Q.  Scott, what about tomorrow now?  You probably need another one of these tomorrow to have a chance to make the Playoffs.  You know it.  It's certainly out there.  You did it today.  What about tomorrow?  
SCOTT LANGLEY: Yeah.  I mean it might be tough to shoot 62 again.  The pins are going to be a lot more difficult.  There will still be some birdies out there for sure.  I just need to stay aggressive.  My game feels pretty good.  Like I said, I'm at peace at whatever happens the next two months.  I need to go and build momentum.  I know if I play well I'll be fine.  Like I said, stick to my game plan, not get too caught up in results.  I'll be fine.   
 Q.  Outstanding day.  Good job.  
SCOTT LANGLEY: Thank you.
