Q.   Scott, great playing.   It started with two bogies so that was the bad.   How did you recover from that and play as well as did you, especially on the back-9?
SCOTT LANGLEY:   Yeah.   I certainly struggled in the ball striking early for the majority of my round but my short game was definitely my insurance policy today.   I scrambled very well for the most part, managed to make some birdies. 
Made a birdie on 6, which was really nice and then I came back right back and bogeyed 7 but I just stayed patient and I knew I was playing well.   So if I just kept giving myself chances I knew I could make a couple.
Before I knew it, I made four on the back and didn't make any bogies.   Just a great back-9.

Q.   Probably your best shot of the back-9 maybe that tee ball at 17.   You stuffed that one.   Just tell me more about it.
SCOTT LANGLEY:   Yeah.   A perfect 4-iron hybrid for me.   Little into the wind, about 213 I think to the hole.   Probably my best swing of the day for sure.   Tricky hole even with the pin right in the middle of the green.   Yeah, as soon as I hit it I just felt like it was going to be really good.   I started kind of walking after it.

Q.   We don't know where 4-under will put you ultimately but you're definitely in the thick of it.   Thank you.
SCOTT LANGLEY:   Thank you, appreciate it.
