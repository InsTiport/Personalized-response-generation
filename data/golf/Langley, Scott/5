 Q.  It seemed like it played tougher in the afternoon.  Wasn't as many low scores, but the stroke average wasn't that different really.  
 What did you see?   
SCOTT LANGLEY: You know, I think any time you play in the afternoon the greens are going to be just a little bumpier because of all the foot traffic.  Maybe that had something to do with it.   
I think it was a little more windy this afternoon than possibly the morning.  That may have had something to do with it as well.   
But the golf course is really fair.  Hit good shots you're gonna be close and you're gonna have good looks at birdies.   
Yeah, I'm a big fan of this place.   
 Q.  And the category you're playing out of this year, 126 to 150, is it in the back of your mind that you need to get off to a good start early this year to...  
SCOTT LANGLEY: My hope is that I am playing out that category for one more week.   
 Q.  Uh-huh.  
SCOTT LANGLEY: That's behind me.  I'm here.  I'm grateful to be here.  Thank you to Frys for giving me an exemption.  My goal is to play as well as I can and get in contention.
