 Q.  So first U.S. Open completed.  Give me the overall feeling of the experience.  
CHANDLER EATON: It's amazing.  I mean, yeah, it's a dream come true for a college golfer.  It's just so cool to kind of be around all these -- I mean, they're the best players in the world, and just see how my game stacks up and see where I need to go and what I need to do.   
I mean, the crazy part is just the focus, the crowds and all the attention that you need to give to people who want your autograph, things like that.  It's like -- it's exhausting.  So definitely like focus on getting rest.  And those sort of things, like eating, better are huge to help me just get a little bit better.   
 Q.  What was I guess the best part of your on-course experience?  
CHANDLER EATON: Yeah.  Just holing a lot of putts.  Putted really good.  That's the best feeling in the world.  Just having the crowds out there, it's so cool.  People yelling, Go, Duke, go, Chandler, and they don't even know who I am, it's like -- it's so different.  And they're so supportive.  It's awesome.  Kind of keeps you going and keeps you wanting to play well.  So yeah.
