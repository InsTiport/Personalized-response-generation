 Q.  Just wondering how you felt out there today.  A pretty good day for a lot of people.  
BRIAN MOGG: Well, it was frustrating to sit for two days.  Finally got to play.  Once you get out to play, it's a totally different golf course.  Instead of balls bouncing and running forever and largely running into tough spots, now all of a sudden balls were staying in fairways, and you could be a little more aggressive with the flags.   
 Q.  So how did that change your approach, then, as you go through the day?  
BRIAN MOGG: Had to be more aggressive.  Usually the whole week you're trying to shave, trying to get starting lines to make sure you kept it in the middle of the green.  And this time, you could be a little more aggressive at it.   
 Q.  You mentioned, obviously, the day off.  How did that impact you?  Some guys say they like it.  Some guys say they'd rather play through it.  
BRIAN MOGG: I'd prefer just keep going and playing, but there's nothing you can do.  The weather happened, and thankfully we got to play today.  We could have been here for a few more days.  I don't think anybody's complaining, at least we got four days in, and the USGA is happy.   
It's cool.  The golf course is one of the best in the country.
