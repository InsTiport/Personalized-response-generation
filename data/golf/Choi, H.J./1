 H.J. CHOI: I went out this morning 7:00, it was like pouring. So wet. But after five-hour, they're great. 
 My putting really well. Tee shot very well. I had a seven birdie, one bogey. That's good. Fantastic. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And now you have a wait before you play again tomorrow. So any ideas what you are going to do with your time between now and maybe tomorrow afternoon?

 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. Questions for H. J.?

 Q. H. J., I was asking Shawn here about the boxing glove on your bag. What's the purpose of that? And I know a lot of players use-- their bags are kind of their identity but there's a boxing glove on one of your clubs. 
 H.J. CHOI: I really like boxing. So like to fight.

 Q. Is that huge in your country, in Korea, or is that something that you watch out here?
 H.J. CHOI: No.

 Q. No? Okay. I was asking your caddie awhile ago, he said the boxing glove, it sort of fits your personality. Are you kind of like a fighter, a scraper on the course?
 H.J. CHOI: Yeah. (Laughter.)
(From translation.) It's because I have a lot of ups and downs. So that's why.

 Q. H.J., you had four straight birdies, 17, 18, 1 and 2, and you had the bogey that 16. Do you think that was kind of --
 H.J. CHOI: That makes me upset.

 Q. Do you think that was -- I mean, was that kind of because of the bogey on 16? Did you -- after 16, were you pretty angry; were you pretty determined to get it back on the right track? I mean, what kind of went through your mind after 16; did you really feel like you had to do something well there?
 H.J. CHOI: Yeah, 16 I was pretty -- I missed three feet putt.
 (From translation.) After making that short three feet putt on 16, missed the putt on 16, I just really try to get myself together and concentrate on the next four holes, the next hole, and that's what really kept me going.

 Q. Looks like looking at the leader board there's a lot of Korean players right at the top. Are you guys very competitive amongst one another or are you very supportive amongst one another? Is there a rivalry between you guys? How is that? Be honest. (Laughter.)
 H.J. CHOI: (From translation.) I think it's not being supportive it's more of competitive side. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: H. J., a great round.
 H.J. CHOI: Thank you.
