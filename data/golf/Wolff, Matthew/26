Q. Matthew, that's high-quality stuff between the two of you today.
MATTHEW WOLFF: Yeah, we played really well.  From the start, I birdied my first hole, he birdied the second, and then from then on, I only made one bogey today and so did he.  I think he only made one on 15.  Kind of just a birdie-fest out there.  I knew from the start, though, it would be a really close match, and just kind of, I guess, went my way at the end.  For the most part, it was pretty much all square, one or two up the most the entire day, so it was hard-fought.
Q. Was there any awkwardness out there considering you're going to be teammates and you've been roommates all week?
MATTHEW WOLFF: No, there was no awkwardness.  I mean, he's a really good friend of mine.  There wasn't -- it sucks that I had to play him, and it's great that I won, but I kind of feel bad that he lost because he's been playing good all week.  But I know he's happy for me, and I know he's just going to be hungry to take me down next tournament we play.
Q. Pretty good second shot you hit into 18.  What did you hit, and what was the yardage?
MATTHEW WOLFF: It was 208 to the pin, 190 to carry the front bunker.  Had that kind of tree kind of overhanging, so I had to hit a cut.  I was going to take 6-iron and muscle it, but the wind was starting to pick up, so I hit a light cut 5-iron, put it like 30 feet pin high left, and I was expecting him to make up-and-down out of the front bunker, and I was actually getting a drink of water on the back, and I wasn't even looking at him, and then he got out of the bunker and started walking across the green, and I was like, did you hit, and apparently he just thinned it a little.  It's unfortunate that he did that and I had to win on him making a bogey, but a win is a win.
Q. Tell me about the birdie at 13 that squared the match.
MATTHEW WOLFF: I had about 125 yards in, really far downwind.  I knew the greens were firming up, too, so I knew if I took sand wedge I'd have to hit it pretty light in order to stop it and get enough spin to put it by the hole.  So I actually ended up taking full lob wedge and landed it five feet past the hole, spun it like back to its pitch mark, and then had about an eight-footer.  I thought it would break left a little more than it did, but luckily it caught the right edge and lipped in, and that kind of squared the match up.
Q. 15, you won with a par to take the lead.
MATTHEW WOLFF: Yeah, he kind of hit a bad drive off the tee and had to punch out.  He hit a good second shot, just went a little too far, and I put a pitching wedge about 15, 20 feet below the hole.  Kind of advantage me.  I hit a pretty good putt, I just -- I was leaving a lot of putts short today.  I wasn't really getting them to the hole.  I mean, I probably need to work on that going into the afternoon.  But luckily he made bogey.
Yeah, and then he birdied 16, which was a big birdie, put it to about five, six feet, and I hit a nice chip from over the green, but birdie to win it, and then 18.
Q. How exciting is it to be in the semifinals now?
MATTHEW WOLFF: It's unbelievable.  You know, I made it to the round of 16 in 2015, and making it to the semifinals, with all these great players in the field, I mean, even the ones that lost like Min Woo and Frankie, Cole Hammer, there's so many great players that didn't even make it this far, and to still be in it and competing, it's awesome.
