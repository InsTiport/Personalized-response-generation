  Q. Just talk about the match a little bit.  Just assess the tie.
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   Yeah, I think it was -- I had a really good time out there.  With all the crowds, that was really awesome to see.  I mean, I don't know if anyone has, but I definitely haven't experienced crowds like that since COVID or as long as I can remember.  So it was really awesome to see everyone out here.
 Felt like I definitely didn't play that great and I am sure Jordan's going to say the same thing.  He's a great player and I just think that with the wind switching today and blowing a little harder made the easy holes easier but then it made the hard holes way harder.  It was a good, tough match until the end.  I gave him a couple holes, he gave me a couple holes, and definitely have couple things to work on, but coming down the stretch I felt like -- 16 I made birdie, I did what I had to do and then fortunately enough he was the one that was hitting first on 17, and I really didn't even think he hit that bad of a tee shot.  I think that wind was just howling out of the right and we couldn't feel it.  To see that was a huge advantage.
 And then on 18 I hit a driver right down the middle and then hit a wedge shot up there tight and he ended up making bogey, but I definitely put myself in all the right spots to put that pressure on him.  So I did what I could control, had a good mental outlook on everything, and came out with a tie.
 Q. Being down late in the match, does it feel kind of like maybe a victory getting a tie?
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   Absolutely.  I mean, I think that especially in group play it's so important to -- just that tie, that I kind of leave that -- or actually maybe not; maybe I don't leave my fate in my own hands because if Jordan wins, as well.
 But I definitely, if I win tomorrow, then I'm at least in a playoff.  So yeah that was a huge victory.
 I didn't feel a hundred percent today, and not only with my game but just all around and it was a little bit of a struggle out there, but, yeah, coming out with a tie is going to make me feel a little better.
 Q. Shows what match play is; you put yourself in the right positions late and you were able to grind out a tie, just by putting the pressure on him a little bit?
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   Yeah, absolutely.  I think that I'm sure -- nothing against Jordan, but I'm sure he's thinking he gave me that match and he might have, but at the end of the day I got it up-and-down on 15 for par to keep the match 2-down and then birdied 16, which, you know, only probably a handful of guys are going to eagle that hole.  So did I what I could there.  And ended up making par on 17 and whatever and then 18 technically I made a birdie, so going 2-under in the last four, like I said, I'm sure he still thinks that he gave it to me and we have different mindsets because we're different people, but felt like I did what I could to put that pressure on him and try to get that tie.
 Q. Do you know how many birdies you had today?
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   No, I don't.  I wish I could say the same thing in stroke play as match play, but I'm not sure.  It was really tough out there.  I think with the different wind, holes like 7, it was all the way back and they tucked that back right flag, I mean, I hit a stinger 4-iron and it still came up a little short.  And then 15 and holes like that, 12, another one.
 Q. Was there one key hole you felt like maybe the momentum was turning a little bit where Jordan was in command for awhile but do you feel like you kind of steadied the ship?
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   Not really.  I think he played -- with that lead he played pretty solid until I think 17.  17 was kind of the turning point when he gave me that hole.  Usually when you're dormie you kind of, you feel pretty good you're like all right just don't screw up pretty much and when he gave me 17 that was big, and then for me to have the honors and pipe it right down the middle was probably putting a little bit of pressure on him.  So I did what I could to put the pressure on him and try to get a tie and that's how it ended up.
 Q. Pretty tough group you guys have here, isn't it.
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   Yeah, yeah.  I mean Corey, Jordan and Matt are all really tough players, world class, and there's not one person in this field though that you can look over.  I mean, you saw yesterday, I forgot his name but Antoine beat Bryson and Matt Kuchar beat Justin Thomas and there's been some upsets, but like Antoine was saying, I don't really know if it was an upset.  I mean, golf is so tricky and anyone can beat anyone on any given day, so just got to go out there and play your game and hopefully you come out on top.
 Q. The fans get into the Texas-Oklahoma State thing or anything?
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   There's not too much of a rivalry between Texas-Oklahoma State.  I think they're definitely on the bigger side and football and stuff they're a little better than us, but I thought the fans were unbelievable out here.  I think that there's a lot obviously Jordan was the favorite, but I got a lot of applause when I made putts and they were very gracious, they clapped and got out of our way and, yeah, I thought being out here with the crowd that we did there was no problems at all and I was really happy to see that.
 Q. On 13 seemed like you guys were trying to work out who might say good-good, and then you had a laugh about it afterwards.  Can you run through that?
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   Yeah, so he hit his putt and he hit a good putt, and I was kind of -- I wasn't that close to the hole, and when you're not on top of it it's kind of hard to tell exactly how far it is, but from my angle it looked like a little over three feet, three and a half feet, and blowing a little hard.  I was like oh, I think I want to see him putt that.  And then when I putted mine, I hit a pretty good putt, pulled it a little, but when we were -- when I walked up there I saw he was a little closer and I knew I was farther out, so in my mind I'm thinking, well, I'm the one who is putting first, I'm the one who has the farther putt so if I say good-good I might look desperate, and then he told me after and that, yeah, he was about to say good-good but I didn't, so that's why he didn't, and it was just the whole, you know -- it was just, it was just a funny match play and it was -- like I said, Jordan's an unbelievable guy, one of my favorites out here, and it was a really fun match and it was a great time.  We laughed a lot and had a good time.
 Q. Certainly was a roller coaster for you guys, some wild shots, some great shots, going up-and-down in the match, I mean did you just figure you just had to ride it out?
 MATTHEW WOLFF:   Pretty much.  I mean I knew with the wind it was playing a lot harder.  Holes like 17 and 18 were going to play much, much harder than they did yesterday.  Yeah, it was just a grind the whole day, really.  I think that I gave him a lot of -- not a lot but I gave him a couple holes and he gave me a couple holes, and when it's playing so hard that's just kind of how it goes.  I had a really good time out there and it was fun.
