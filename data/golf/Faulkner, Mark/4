  Q. Did you know what you needed coming in?  
 MARK FAULKNER: I don't have a clue. I don't know --  
  
  Q. The cut's four.   
 MARK FAULKNER: It is four? Seriously? I'll be darned. No, I figured when I hit it in the water on 7 that I probably shot myself out of it. So nice change. Yeah, I didn't know it was that big a putt.   
  
  Q. But now that you do, was it any -- you weren't even nervous because you didn't know what was on the line, right?  
 MARK FAULKNER: Right. It was an easy putt. Just a little outside the hole and up the hill. So I hadn't played the bunkers very well the first few days and wasn't looking forward to another bunker sot. I wore my caddie out today and yesterday, so happy with a 4.   
  
  Q. What's it mean to you just to be around for the weekend?  
 MARK FAULKNER: Oh, great. I don't have to go back to work for two more days. The help's probably not happy, but looking forward to being here for a few you more days.  
  
  Q. Make a little money too?  
 MARK FAULKNER: Right. Now we can relax and just enjoy the weekend.
