Q.   Tell me about your birdie holes on the front nine.   You had two, right?
MARK FAULKNER:   Oh, 5, yeah, I hit a good 3‑wood there and then I laid up to a good 9‑iron.   I hit the 9‑iron to about 15 feet and had one of my few made putts. 
And then 8, just another good driver, 9‑iron into the wind.   Hit it to about 12 feet.

Q.   What are you looking to work on going into tomorrow?
MARK FAULKNER:   Well, trying to skip number 11.   I hit a pitching wedge there just about 10 feet right of where I was aiming and got down in the bunker and was up against the lip.   So a little better course management.   I hit it in a couple green side bunkers that were short sided and then just not really paying attention to the pin sheet. 

Q.   What makes this course so challenge would you say?
MARK FAULKNER:   Obviously the greens.   The fairways are ample and the length isn't bad, although it was a little bit windy, the wind didn't seem to affect a lot of shots, though it kept you from getting to the right side of the green sometimes though.   You really don't want a 30 foot putt out here.   Because you might have a 20‑footer coming back going sideways.
