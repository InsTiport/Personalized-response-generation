  Q. Just an overview of your play today.   
 MARK FAULKNER: Oh, just swing felt good on the range, I got to the second hole and mishit a shot and just never seemed to find the timing after that.   
 I didn't make any putts all day. The greens are great, but just misread them a little bit and hopefully can comeback and do a little better tomorrow.
