 Q. Talk about your day today. 
 MARK FAULKNER: It was a beautiful day, nice golf course. Everybody was polite. Didn't play -- I played better. I had a little help this morning on the range and I found a little bit more of a swing, but just didn't make putts today. I hit the ball more solid and I had had some opportunities today, but I enjoyed it very much.

 Q. Talk about your week as a whole. 
 MARK FAULKNER: The week was great, it was nice making cut and good to be here. And I had some up-and-downs, but never found a really real good swing, the timing wasn't there, I didn't feel comfortable, but otherwise it was very enjoyable.
