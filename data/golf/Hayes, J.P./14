Q.  Good day today and you're right there on that leaderboard.  It's got to be a good thought as you get ready for Sunday.
J.P. HAYES:  Yeah, I got myself back into position.  I got off to kind of a shaky start.  Well, not really shaky, I just made a bogey on kind of the easiest hole on the course and set me back a little bit.  But I hit every green today, one par 5 in two, and I hit a lot of putts that lipped out.  All in all, it was a good day.
Q.  You've got some that are lipping out.  That's got to give you a good feeling that if those drop in tomorrow, that could be your hot day and the biggest day of all?
J.P. HAYES:  Yeah, I hit so many good putts today, and I knew that I would make some coming in because it just had to happen, and I did and got myself back into position.
Q.  You've won this event before.  Does that give you confidence going into tomorrow?
J.P. HAYES:  A little bit.  Like I said, it's a different time and a different place in my life and my game, and I'm playing well.  In a lot of respects I'm playing better than when I won last time.  There's still a lot of work to do, and I don't know, I'll probably be three or four out, so I'll have to play very well tomorrow.
