   J.P. HAYES: It was on the right side of the green. I was hitting the ball right-to-left. It was windy. The course is in great shape, but it was windy.  
  
  Q. Did you play yesterday?  
 J.P. HAYES: I played the practice round on Tuesday. Did a little bit, but not much.  
  
  Q. What did you think of the Mayakoba Golf Classic at Riviera Maya-Cancun? It's your first time here.  
 J.P. HAYES: I love it. I love it. It's awesome. The golf course is great, great shape. It's pretty fair. I took yesterday to get off the ground.  
  
  Q. Is that kind of how you felt or you had to earn that?  
 J.P. HAYES: No. I was pretty happy with 66. Like I said, there were some rounds. I know it was pretty tough out there, so and there were some long holes, too. Hit it off the fairway a little bit.  
  
  Q. Were you putting well coming in?  
 J.P. HAYES: No. No. I haven't putted well in two years. (Laughs).  
  
  Q. Was it like that in your practice time on Tuesday or you woke up today and had to start?  
 J.P. HAYES: No. A lot of things have been going on with my putting, but I've been practicing the last couple weeks, mostly at home. I've started getting my confidence back. Tuesday it was kind of hard to practice on just putting, but I kind of felt like coming out.  
  
  Q. It's more of a mental versus -  
 J.P. HAYES: Yeah.  
  
  Q. How does the wind affect your putt?  
 J.P. HAYES: Well, if it's sticky enough or slow enough, the wind's not going to really blow it around too much, but there was one putt on the par three, number seven that I think -- it stayed pretty straight. I'm in a pretty good place hopefully right now.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 J.P. HAYES: Well, I hit it about ten feet on the first hole, made that.  
  
  Q. Started with a birdie?  
 J.P. HAYES: I started with a birdie, and then I hit a pretty good tee shot and what I felt was the second shot on 11 was way over the green and hit a bad chip and made about a 15-footer for par. So right off the bat, the same thing happened with the putter, so no. It's just a gradual thing.  
  
  Q. What was your other big long putt?  
 J.P. HAYES: I'm sorry?  
  
  Q. Your other long putt that you hit today.  
 J.P. HAYES: Yeah. I didn't really make any long ones. I think the longest one I made was 15 feet. A lot of 5, 6-footers for par, to save par. And then a couple birdies.  
  
  Q. When you're in that groove, you get better on the long ones or you know the hole looks big on the short ones?  
 J.P. HAYES: Well, you don't feel uncomfortable on the long ones because you know you're making the short ones. So you kind of free it up a little bit to make the 30-footers.  
 It goes all the way back out to the fairway, too. If you're making putts, it frees you up to make a little bit more aggressive play to the pin, with the irons. You know when you get the greens, you're going to get it up and down.  
  
  Q. Your margin of error kind of expands?  
 J.P. HAYES: Yeah.  
  
  Q. The best part about being done early is you get the rest of the day off.  
 J.P. HAYES: Yeah. I get to relax a little bit.  
  
  Q. Did you bring your family?  
 J.P. HAYES: No. Solo.  
  
  Q. It's more of a working week than a vacation?  
 J.P. HAYES: Yeah. Yeah.  
  
  Q. What were the wind conditions like out there?  
 J.P. HAYES: Pretty windy.
