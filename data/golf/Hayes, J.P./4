  Q. J.P., top 10 finish for you. I notice that you're using the long putter. You seem committed to it this season, and it's paying off.   
 J.P. HAYES: That's the big distinction: I've committed to it. I haven't given myself the opportunity to switch by traveling with six other putters in my bag.   
 It's kind of nice to show up at a tournament with one putter and you know that's what you're gonna use.  
  
  Q. Nice to see you commit. And with good results, has to give you some confidence.  
 J.P. HAYES: Yeah, I'm looking forward to every week this year. I'm really enjoying myself, and got a fresh perspective after a couple lean years. Gonna be fun.
