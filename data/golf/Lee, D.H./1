 Q.  Just tell me a little bit about playing here, the conditions today.  
D.H. LEE: Yeah, really first time visit here this tournament.  And then I come back to the PGA TOUR first tournament even this week, so first two hole really nervous.  I don't know how to hit it.  So that's why bogey, bogey start.   
After that I make birdies and feels much better.  Then I trying to be calm on my shots.   
Yeah, really good round.  I make two on No. 13 -- 14?  Yeah, 14.  So I make two.  Really happy there.   
Really solid ever day today.  Everything is solid.  I hit driver, a lot of fairway.  It's more the chance coming to the (indiscernible).  It's firm green out here.  I trying to do good controlling iron shot today.   
 Q.  What do you like about the course?  
D.H. LEE: Really not easy, I think.  Has to be thinking course, how to course management is the more play the more easier.   
But if I trying to a little miss the rough, it's really difficult.  Every hole is really difficult, so it's first thing is to keep in fairways.  Very important this week.   
 Q.  Looking forward to the rest of the week?  
D.H. LEE: Yeah.  First round finishing, so now is good position.  I need three more rounds, so I doesn't thinking anymore.  Just playing.   
 Q.  But a nice start to the season?  
D.H. LEE: Yeah.
