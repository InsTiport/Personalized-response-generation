Q.   How was your great back nine?   32?   Tell me a little bit about that. 
CRAIG STEVENS:   It was really good.   I played really solid today.   I had one bad hole on No. 6, I made triple bogey.   So I was 5‑over par after 6 and I brought it back to 1‑over. 
I had a real solid round of golf after that.

Q.   How about the course conditions compared to like the practice round, the wind conditions?
CRAIG STEVENS:   This is a south wind and I think that the north wind gives most of the players, I think, the hardest time.   At least it does for me. 
The south wind, it's cross on a few holes but it's to my advantage and I like it.   But we hope it keeps blowing and let them all have fun out there.
