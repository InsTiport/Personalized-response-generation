  Q. Just talk about today's round and how hard it was out there today.   
 CRAIG STEVENS: Well, you know, I had expectations for playing a lot better than I did. I did okay, I started off pretty good and then I hit a couple sideways and I made a double bogey. You know, it's disappointing. I mean, we don't get to play at this level a lot, and we have expectations of coming out here to play well.   
 You know, I enjoy it. It's great, the people, the cheers and all that. But all in all, I had a really good time, and I hope to do it again.  
  
  Q. What's one of the things you're going to take away from the experience out here the past two days?  
 CRAIG STEVENS: Well, I would say that the support that I got. I made a couple of really long putts out there and made some birdies, and it's great to hear the people behind me. I've got a good cheering section, and the support from them is awesome.  
 I played with two really good guys, John Rollins and Brendon de Jonge, and I think both of them are going to be here for the weekend. Really super guys, and if I play golf with people like that, I just really, really enjoy it.  
  
  Q. We know that you're a teaching pro, also. Anything that you'll take from here, from this experience, and take it to the people that you might teach?  
 CRAIG STEVENS: Well, you know, it's such a tough thing because a lot of the people that are out here watching us play, it's at such a high level, and part of what I try to teach and instill into people is to try to have fun. Golf is such a hard game.
