 Q.   Your thoughts on your overall round today.   
CRAIG STEVENS:   You know, it was up‑and‑down.   I got through and I finished okay.   It was kind of tough for me, it is my first cut I made.   My mind's going a mile a minute.   But all in all I'm happy, now that I get to play on the weekend and let's just have some fun and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   What are you looking forward to most then about the weekend?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   Just being out here with the guys and getting to play on the weekend.   I was here two years ago and I missed the cut by one.   This year I'm under one.   So I'm just looking forward to that.   It's going to be a fun time.   
   
 Q.   How is the course playing?   How are the conditions out there?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   The golf course is playing pretty good.   It's got plenty of opportunities out there.   Now that we have been here for three or four days and we're getting it, getting a good feel for it, it's getting better.   It's a good track.
