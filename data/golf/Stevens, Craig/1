 Q.   It seemed like it was pretty up‑and‑down.   What are your thoughts on the round?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   Well, I did okay.   The last hole was a double, and that put me back to even, but it was up‑and‑down, I hit it solid.   I think I did okay.   
   
 Q.   Did you notice, was there a difference in like the pin placements?   Did it seem tougher?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   No, I didn't really see ‑‑ when you hit it on the green in pretty good spots, then they don't seem that tough.   I didn't have a tough time with the pins on the greens today at all.  
   
 Q.   You're pretty close to the top of at least the club pros.   What would it mean to be the top one at the end of the day tomorrow?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   That would be awesome.   We're in our own little league here and I know there was nine guys that made the cut and if I go out and play good tomorrow, I think that I have a good chance.   
I played with Kenny Perry, he's such an awesome guy, we were going along there pretty good.   So it was a good day.
