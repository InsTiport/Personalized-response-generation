 Q.   Club pro?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   Yes, sir.  
   
 Q.   Even round?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   Played pretty solid.   
   
 Q.   You had four birdies and four bogeys?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   I had I think three and three.   I putted well, didn't hit the ball as close as I wanted, but all in all, I'm satisfied.   
   
 Q.   How often are you playing on senior events?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   This is my third is senior event.   I played in the first one here, I played in the U.S. Senior Open last year and then I'm back this year.   
   
 Q.   As a club pro, is there anything different in how you are going to prepare the next three days compared to guys that are doing it every week?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   Well, I'm just trying to have fun, don't put myself in too much pressure, because it is golf, but at the same time the course is, they're a little more extreme, harder than what we usually play on, so that's really what I'm working on, it's just getting my putts pace down and putting well.  
   
 Q.   Did the wind become more difficult of a factor as your round went on?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   No, it really didn't.   My mind was there today, so it didn't bother me.   If my mind was not there, then it really bothers me.   But it was a couple of holes that were into the wind, like number 7, that's a how far hole hitting it up there.   But other than that, it was pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Is there any particular part of your game that was working well for you?  
CRAIG STEVENS:   No, I hit the ball pretty solid.   I did hit one ball in the hazard though.
