 Q.   So 4â€‘under par leading the golf tournament.   How does that feel?  
BETH BADER:   Yeah, it feels good.   Been a while since I've been here.   Been a while since I actually tee'd up in an event.  
But it's good.   I practiced hard.   I played some Grasshopper Tour events in Phoenix to get ready and keep going.   So it was nice to be able to transition back into target golf, because I haven't done that for a while.   So I'm very pleased.  
   
 Q.   Talk about your round today.   What went right for you?  
BETH BADER:   Yeah, I drove the ball pretty good.   It was obviously pretty windy getting going.   Made some nice up and downs the first few holes.   Yeah, the first three holes made some good up and downs.  
Then I got comfortable and made some pretty good swings with my driver, which left me some shorter irons in.   Then made some pretty good putts today, too.  
   
 Q.   Take me through obviously the last few years you haven't played that many events.   What's kept you busy and away from the LPGA?  
BETH BADER:   Well, nothing.   I mean, I want to be out here.   I had some back issues that kind of hindered me a little bit.   Trying to go through a couple swing changes because of my back.  
But, boy, yeah, I mean, I wish I could have played more events than I did.   You got to grind through it, and hopefully it'll be a little different this year.
