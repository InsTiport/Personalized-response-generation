Q.   What does it take to win a playoff?
JAY HAAS:   Well, I think that a lot of times when we're playing the last three or four holes it almost feels like we're in a playoff.   If you have a oneâ€‘shot lead or you're tied or something like that.   So I don't know that there's any difference, other than I just try to tell myself that I don't get many opportunities, so take advantage of it. 
I think there can be somewhat of a let down in the fact that you, the worst you're going to do is finish second and so some people, that's great, they free wheel it and everything, but to me I think, man, this is a great chance, a great opportunity to win the tournament, so I just try to talk myself into it. 
But again, I think that so much of it is, if you're tied for the lead with two holes to play or one hole to play, to me that's like a playoff.   So I don't know that it's really a whole lot different. 

Q.   How many years has it taken to learn that, to get comfortable with that?
JAY HAAS:   Oh, you know, it's a lifetime learning process.
