Q. You're the hero to a lot of us on the TOUR, individuals.  How do you maintain your excellence this long, top-20 finishes every year in this thing?
JAY HAAS: Well, you know, in general, I've been blessed with good health and that's helped me a little bit.  And my passion for the game is still there.  I still enjoy competing.  And fortunately I have my game this week, I really played well from tee to green.  I didn't feel like I putted well.  Didn't putt awful but just didn't make a lot of putts.  And I'm disappointed with 4-over the last day, but it was a really hard day to play, a lot of wind and the pins were difficult.  But I think mostly just the want-to.  Still have the passion to play.  I think that's the key.
Q. And throw in 7,000 feet almost.
JAY HAAS: Right.
Q. Uphills?
JAY HAAS: I felt good all week.  Never felt tired or out of breath or anything like that.  I just kind of felt, you know, I was one foot in front of the other.  And again I really drove the ball well, hit a lot of solid shots off the tee.  And my irons were good.  I felt confident hitting into the greens, and I was able to keep it in most of the fairways and had a hiccup on 15 today.  It was disappointing to make 6 there.  But overall I was pretty pleased and felt I could have even been a lot better.
