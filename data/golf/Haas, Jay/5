 Q.  Can you describe your emotions?  
JAY HAAS: Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to get through this (tearing up) I can't.  I'm so happy for the team.  A great bunch of guys.  We were riding back down the fairway on 18 before Bill played 17, and I said, "Come on, Bill, win one for your mom here.  Your mom deserves this."   
Oh, my gosh, when we put him out 12th, had no idea obviously that that was going to happen.  But he played beautiful, beautiful shot down the stretch, 16, 17, 18.  I didn't see the shot here at the end, how close it came.  But just proud of all of them.  Couldn't even have dreamt this.  I'm just real happy for the guys.
