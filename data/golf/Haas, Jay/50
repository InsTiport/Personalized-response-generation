  Q. What were your general thoughts on the course today?  
 JAY HAAS: I thought it was very playable, even though the wind's picking up in spots. I think they slowed the greens down a little bit so the balls aren't getting away from us on the greens so much. And the scores are showing that. With low scores being 6-under and 5-under and 4-under.   
 So it was somewhat difficult today, if you hit good shots you were rewarded though. I'm disappointed with 1-over par. I played pretty well today. Didn't make a lot of putts. Hit a couple wayward drives, but overall it could be worse. It's a tough golf course.  
  
  Q. How did this championship compare to your many others you've played in?  
 JAY HAAS: Well, this is a, it's a championship golf course, it has that feel to it. The guys who set the course up in a very challenging way, as a Major should be. But we, but some of the guys are up to the challenge today for sure. But it has that Major feel to it. There's a good crowd out here today. Hopefully by the weekend there will be even more. So I hope the leaders don't get too far away from me.  
  
  Q. What are you going to try to work on before tomorrow?  
 JAY HAAS: I need to be lagging the putts before. I think anybody that wins a tournament or finishes high in a tournament putts well. So I need to work on doing that. And I did drive the ball okay, except for a couple drives. It's kind of hard to work on your game out here with so much wind. But I'm learning the golf course, I think that's important. Each day we learn a little bit more out here. So hopefully I can stay steady tee to green and just make a few more putts.
