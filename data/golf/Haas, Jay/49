  Q. Thoughts on your round today?  
 JAY HAAS: I really played well today. I hit a lot of good shots, made a bunch of birdies, but just can't seem to get on top of it. I shot 2-under, but I got it to 3-under and made a couple more birdies in between there, but made three bogeys, so just a little disappointed with 70. 70's a good score around here, but I think there were better scores early on. The wind's kind of turned around here all of a sudden and you just don't know what to expect around here.  
  
  Q. How do you feel heading into Sunday?  
 JAY HAAS: There's a lot of guys between me and the leader, that's for sure, I'm seven back right now. I don't know what it will be by the end of the day, but I would have to really shoot a low one. Although David Frost shot 7-under today, he's proved to us that we can, somebody can shoot low. You got to really play well. But who knows, I'm going to come out here and give it my best.
