Q.
Talk about your round and what was the difference for you today?
JAY HAAS:  I did well today.  I missed putts early on, 1 and 2.  3, I missed an eight footer for par.  No. 11, it cost me two shots there.  I played pretty well.  Some putts here and there.  I'm getting closer, but I played good from tee to green.
Q.  And the way Tiger played today, not quite a perfect round but an exceptional round?
JAY HAAS:  I would have had to play well, obviously.  He missed a couple of putts in the middle of the round.  I don't know about early, but in the middle of the round he missed a couple of makable ones, from where we were standing.  It looked like he had it on cruise control for a while there.
Q.  Enjoyable week for you?
JAY HAAS:  Yes, I played well for a few days, four rounds in the 60s.  I'm going to have a nice winter now.
Q.  What's Christmas like at the Haas house?
JAY HAAS:  We have a big den that usually you can't see the floor after a little while, but that will be fun.  We've always enjoyed that time.  That means I'm home, dad's home for a while, and I'm going to enjoy the time off.
