 Q. Jay, we are seeing the real Jay Haas right now?
 JAY HAAS: Well, I hope this is more like what's to come. I played very well all week. I did a lot of good things. I didn't -- you know, I didn't save every shot. I 3-putted No. 16 and I was disappointed with that after knocking it on the green, challenging that hole, but birdieing the last hole, that means a lot to me. 

 Q. You are one of the top names on the Champions Tour. Tell me about your feeling being in MontrÃ©al for the last four or five days. I think the players really enjoyed their stay. 
 JAY HAAS: Without question they did. I think I can speak for all of them. The ovation that we received on the last hole, not only when we make the putt, but walking off the green, everybody is very appreciative, very respectful fans. It's been a great first year, and hopefully this is the first of many to come. 

 Q. Well, I really hope that MontrÃ©al changed everything for you and that you're going to be on top for the rest of the year. 
 JAY HAAS: I would like that very much, and I will remember that it was MontrÃ©al that turned it around.
