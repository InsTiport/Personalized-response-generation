JAY HAAS: You know, there was committee error that told him that he was disqualified from the hole and he should pick up.  That was incorrect.  And they acknowledge that, but the fact is, when there's a one-hole match adjustment, what they call, and in match play, if you break the rules unbeknownst to everyone and later on in the match, if you realize that, then there's an adjustment of one hole, how many holes, if you have too many clubs in your bag and you play, it's a four-stroke penalty in medal play, it's two holes in match.
So you find out on the 15th hole, you're two more holes down.  So that cannot be amended.  It's just unfortunate that he was told he had to pick up the ball.  Had he been able to play out and make a four and tie the hole, then it would only have been 1-down instead of 2-down.  But that didn't happen.  So nothing you can do about it.
We talked to Mark Russell, and they acknowledged that it was their error, but again, there's nothing to be done.
Q. And if it's probably going to happen to anybody, it's probably best to happen to Phil because he's seen it all and done it all.  Won't shake him too much.
JAY HAAS: He said:  All right, we got it, no problem, we're going to work it out.  It was my mistake.
He was not angry.  He wasn't angry at himself.  Just, Hey, rookie mistake, my fault captain, we'll get it back.
