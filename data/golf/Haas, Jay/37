Q.   Nice round today.   Kind of talk about the way you felt out there,
JAY HAAS:   Yeah, I hit a lot of good shots.   It's a pretty tough course today with all the wind, totally different wind than what we played in the practice round, so we were kind of guessing a little bit on some of the holes. 
But I did a lot of good things.   I was a little shaky coming in, but the holes are a little more difficult and the wind's starting to pick up. 
I made a nice about six or seven foot putt for bogey on the last hole, which bogeys don't taste too good usually, but I didn't want to make a six on 18. 
But I'm happy with 1‑under and learning the course as I go, but I feel like if I keep driving it in the fairway I have a chance.

Q.   At the end of the day do you think that anything in red is going to be a pretty good score?
JAY HAAS:   I think so.   I think 3 is low and then there's a few 2s out there, but I wouldn't expect more than a dozen scores or so under par after today's round. 
They were pretty generous with some of the tees, they got us up a little bit.   As it is, they moved the tee up on 4 and still that's the No. 1 hardest hole on the course today.   And it's a par‑3.   But they were pretty good to us today with the tee markers.
I like the course better every day after I play.
