 Q.   Nice round, great start.   What do you need to do tomorrow?  
JAY HAAS:   Just hit a little better than I did today.   I was a little shaky coming in but overall the first two days I've hit a lot of good shots and given myself a good many chances.   Just need to play a hell of a round, actually.   
There's so many good players up there, guys that have been kicking my butt for the last 35 years.   It's certainly not going to be easy.   I just need to really play well.  
   
 Q.   Fred Couples will be in the group in front of you; would you prefer to be in the final group?   
JAY HAAS:   You know, I'm just glad I saved a shot at the last hole.   I was looking at that and thought if I did make a putt, didn't make the putt for par, I would possibly be in the last group, but it was more just trying to save a shot.   I don't really care where I am.   I've still got to play good shots, and you know, somebody could come‑from‑behind.   There's quite a few players that are bunched in there, so I'm just glad to be‑‑ 3‑under today is not too bad.
