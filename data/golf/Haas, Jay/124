Q.
Yesterday I'm marveling at you knocking in 20-foot jump shots with a basketball.  Today you roll in a 4-under par round.  Good start, Jay.
JAY HAAS:  Yeah, it was.  I played very well from tee to green and made a few putts early.  I got 4-under after 8 holes.  I would have liked to have gotten a few more, but it's a tough golf course.  I think anything under par here for me is good.
Q.  Obviously the goal, keep you in that Top 30, get you a trip to Atlanta.
JAY HAAS:  Yeah, it was a good start for that.  I didn't play well a couple weeks ago at Greensboro.  I held my position for a while.  I'm surprised I haven't been passed before now.

I just feel like if I come here and play well, then that'll take care of itself.  If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, but it's nice to be in contention to do that.
Q.  2004 will be regarded as a pretty darn good season for Jay Haas.
JAY HAAS:  The last couple have been good.  I've played very well and a lot of good things have happened to me, playing on the Ryder Cup team, playing on The Presidents Cup team last year.

A lot of good stuff has been happening, and I don't want it to end.  I want to keep prolonging this as long as I can.
Q.  Obviously we've been talking about your goal to make the Top 30.  How about winning?
JAY HAAS:  Well, that's always in the back of my mind, I guess, or in the front, somewhere bouncing around in there.

I played very well today from tee to green.  If I could do that the rest of the week, I'd have a chance anyway.  Keeping the ball in the fairway is of the utmost importance this week.  The rough is very thick.  Obviously Jeff did that very well today, but I did, too.  From tee to green I hit many good shots and had a lot of opportunities.
Q.  Keep it going.
JAY HAAS:  I hope so.  Thanks.
