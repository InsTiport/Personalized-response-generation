 Q. Talk about your round today and what -- I saw you had a good front nine there and then shot well on the back too. 
 JAY HAAS: Yeah, I played better, maybe got a little more what I deserved today. I made a couple nice putts here and there. There's still some drives that I'm not happy with and that needs to get better before I can threaten them, but maybe I can work it out this afternoon. 

 Q. Six back headed into tomorrow, realistic chances of contending?
 JAY HAAS: You know, obviously I gave myself an opportunity here, but it's going to have to be pretty low. There's a lot of guys between me and the leaders, so it depend on what they do this afternoon. 
 If it doesn't get any more than 3-under, then maybe I've got a chance. But if it goes 4, 5-under, you know, that's asking a lot. But there's maybe a 64 or 65 out here. I'm going to have to play pretty perfectly to do that. 

 Q. The European PGA wants a quick thought on The Open at Sunningdale and your thoughts on that. 
 JAY HAAS: I have not played there, I haven't played really around London. I played St. George's in the Open when Ben Curtis won, so I really only played mostly in the north in Scotland and one time in England, I guess. 
 But I'm anxious, I've heard nothing but good things about it. A couple of my daughters and my wife are going to go and we're going to rent something around the course there and they're going to go in and out of London. And it's a pretty neat thing I think for them to be able to see that and do that. But, no, I'm anxious to see that. I've heard nothing but good things about it.
