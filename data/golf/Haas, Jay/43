 Q. If you can just give me a couple thoughts about the day. 
 JAY HAAS: You know, this was probably our easiest day to play in relation to the weather just because the wind didn't blow very much. The course is maybe set up a little more difficult. But the greens remained kind of soft, so we could kind of shoot at the flags a little bit. They're not unbelievably fast. So it's leading to some good scores.
 Unfortunately I got a good score today, 3-under, a nice score, held my position, I think maybe bumped up a couple spots. I haven't threatened the leaders yet, but hopefully tomorrow I can go crazy.

 Q. Having to adjust to those course conditions, what does that do to you mentally?
 JAY HAAS: Not really. I guess the tournaments I've played here in the past, the major tournaments, the course has played much more difficult. I think because of the weather the greens have been firmer and faster so you really had to be cautious when you were putting, when you're chipping to them, when you're hitting into them. And that's not in the back of my mind right now, so I'm being more aggressive. So I've had to kind of adjust to think, I've got to make a birdie here, I've got to shoot for pins more. 
 And looking at the lead, it's not just one or two guys; it's quite a few guys who have an opportunity to win the tournament, from maybe 7-under on not totally out of it. So there's a lot of guys up there, and for me it'll take something awfully low tomorrow.

 Q. So moving forward, what kind of adjustment do you think you have to make?
 JAY HAAS: Just to remain aggressive and to think maybe 64, 65, 66 or something instead of saying, let's just make pars here. I just have to be more aggressive.
