Q.
Are you feeling good about your week?
JAY HAAS:  Yeah, I'm disappointed with today.  I wasn't real sharp.  I played okay but made a 6 at No. 9 and kind of got me so far back that there were just too many guys between me and the lead.

I didn't putt very well today, didn't get it real close, but overall, yeah, I'm -- I was kind of in-between clubs and tried to cut a 5-wood in there and kind of pulled it and went over the green left and didn't get that on and didn't get that up and down.  It was just kind of a slow 6.
Q.  Is that your first comeback in some time?
JAY HAAS:  Yeah, I love Deere Run.  It's in great shape, a wonderful golf course.  The people here really seem to get behind it.  It's a fun course to play.  I'll be back.
Q.  There may be other guys on the Tour that realize as the years go on and increase --
JAY HAAS:  Well, it's a good quality golf course.  It's in good condition, a good, fun golf course to play, and I think if you're looking for a place to add a tournament or two, this definitely should be one of them.
Q.  Do you know what the Ryder Cup --
JAY HAAS:  Well, I finished 11th so I don't get any points.
Q.  I know that was one of the reasons you came here.
JAY HAAS:  Yeah, and I don't think it was a failure by any means, but you always like to do better.  There are plenty of holes where I felt like I gave some away.  I didn't putt well today and that was disappointing, but it wasn't awful, in 11th place, and not terrible.  I'd be lying if I said I was too terribly disappointed, but still, my goal is to win, and I didn't do that.
