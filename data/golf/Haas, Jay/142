Q.  How many holes did you get in?  8?
JAY HAAS:  We got 9 in.
Q.  Do you feel satisfied going into tomorrow?
JAY HAAS:  Yes and no.  I was playing pretty well and then as it got darker I didn't play as well.  I had trouble in the dark, I guess.  It's hard putting in the dark.  And I'm a little disappointed I 3-putted the last hole.  But I'm playing well and doing a lot of good things, so anxious for tomorrow to get here and hopefully it will go the way it's planned and I can shoot something good tomorrow.
Q.  Time to go to bed?
JAY HAAS:  Well, it's late now.
Q.  Do you think the course has changed much since you played it earlier, do you think it's changed too much or about the same do you think?
JAY HAAS:  Since I played it?
Q.  Yesterday and today.
JAY HAAS:  It's about the same.  It's not much different.  The greens are about the same speed, maybe a little bit slower than they were yesterday morning when we started off.  But it's pretty similar.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
JAY HAAS:  Well, we're not playing lift, clean, and place so that makes a big difference.  The balls are kind of squirting on us a little bit.  But it's pretty tough.  It's playing long, we didn't get much wind this afternoon or this evening.
