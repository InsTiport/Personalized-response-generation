  Q. Reaction, Robert, one hell of a day?   
 ROBERT ROCK: It was good. I probably made a little mistake there at the end. I was trying to chip it in.   
  
  Q. You shouldn't have tried to chip it in?  
 ROBERT ROCK: Well, you want to, don't you, you want to try and win, and I was a little bit too firm with it. Didn't really give -- just get it up-and-down, I just tried to get it the line right and chip-in, and left me a bit of work at the end, which I didn't do a great job with the putt, but no mind.  
 Shane, it's absolutely unbelievable what he's done. So I'm happy for him, yeah. It's good.   
  
  Q. Did he ask you about the money, as well, 500,000 Euro?   
 ROBERT ROCK: It is a little bit of a consolation, and so we got something out of it, haven't we.
