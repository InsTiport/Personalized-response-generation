Q. A scrambling bogey in a round of 72, on 18 you made a great bogey save there, how difficult were the conditions today?
ROBERT ROCK: It was tough, really from about maybe the fifth or sixth hole.  Actually the first hole was really tough.  I saw a few guys had made double on the first and I was wondering why, because the first not normally that hard.  Hit driver and 3-wood and realised that was why.
It was kind of just consistent, strong wind, all the way around, and downwind was hard and into the wind was very hard.  So that's what we expect, really, isn't it.  Didn't rain, so it was all right.
Q. How much was patience really the recipe for a day like today?
ROBERT ROCK: I think they have done the smart thing here, really.  The greens are just a little bit slow, and we needed that, because balls were close to moving, and I guess if we had normal-speed greens, they would have rolled off the green today, so that was a good move.
But it's difficult, you see the ball wobbling, and you think, what do you do; do you wait?  You wait forever, it puts you off.  I did that on one hole, it was two foot, backed off it, and knew I was going to miss it.
