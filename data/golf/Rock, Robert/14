Q. Bogey-free, saw you on the range with the camera out prior to yesterday's round, a bit of practise --
ROBERT ROCK: Absolutely, yeah.  I played a few holes on Tuesday and I was horrendous.  I pulled most of my shots and I came here thinking I had done my homework and I practised quite a lot last week.  So that was a bit of a shock and I normally don't do much on Wednesday, but didn't have much choice to sort it out.
