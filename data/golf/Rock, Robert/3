 Q.  Thanks for joining us.  Not obviously the victory you were hoping for, but some consolation that you will be playing for this beautiful trophy in The Open coming up?  
ROBERT ROCK: Guess I don't have to try and qualify on Tuesday, so to get in is excellent.  I'm looking forward to playing another Open.  Didn't know whether I would get to play in any more.  But disappointed, you don't often get too many chances to win.  It was nice playing the last few holes, seeing a score to try and reach, but it was just a bit too much.   
 Q.  Having said that, you came into the week saying that you were playing rubbish and you played beautifully, shooting 60.  A lot of positives to take forward?  
ROBERT ROCK: I couldn't really, for most of this year so far, I've not been able to build a score properly.  Play well one day, just throwing easy shots away, and then scrambling days, and to put one together and shoot 60 is pretty cool.  I didn't see that coming at all, especially at the start of the week during Open Qualifying, couldn't build a score there, either.   
Shooting 60 yesterday was awesome, but just ran out of putts today.   
 Q.  Do you see this as a platform to build on, a boost of confidence for the rest of the season with the mass of tournaments to come; that you can build on this and have a decent season?  
ROBERT ROCK: Yeah, why not?  Last year was a slow start and ended up making Race to Dubai.  Every year is different.  I think you've probably learned that once you've done a good number of years.  You realise that they can't all be the same.  Can't all start off great and everything goes to plan.   
If you're patient with it, you know you're going to play well at some point.
