   ROBERT ROCK: It was pretty much exactly the same as yesterday. The putter did all the work and the rest of it was pretty average. But it was nice to putt well yesterday and I've done the same again, so I'm chuffed. 

 Q. You were pretty amazed about that on the first day, so doubly so?
 ROBERT ROCK: Even more, yeah. Don't know what's happening but Jamie is reading them great and stroke feels okay, so I just keep hitting it and they are getting close. 
 Different for me but I'm enjoying it.

 Q. I do know how stupid a question this is when you say you don't know what's happening, but what is happening?
 ROBERT ROCK: I had a little lesson off Richard Bland, actually the other day. I had one with Marc Warren last week, and Richard Bland this week. And I think I need to just keep getting more putting lessons I think. I took it the same as maybe all other lessons I had, and I tried and it just started to work straightaway. 
 So after a couple go in, you start to have a bit of belief in it, and then I was quite confident by end of yesterday and it's carried onto today. It could have gone today and I wouldn't have known at all, but holed some decent putts.
