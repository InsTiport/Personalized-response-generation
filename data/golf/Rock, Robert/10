 Q.  Great score today and great finish, as well.  
ROBERT ROCK: Yeah, it's good to finish a tournament like that.  Really, round was going quite slowly.  Nicked a birdie on the 16 from just off the green, get a big finish, moved me up a little bit.   
Hit a great second shot to 17.   
 Q.  That got you into Turkey.  How much are you looking forward to that?  
ROBERT ROCK: Yeah, I played last year.  It's a new course this time, so I'm looking forward to going back and having a chance to try and squeeze myself into The Race to Dubai final.   
 Q.  As a whole this week, been positive for you?  
ROBERT ROCK: Great.  I love this week.  I treat it a little bit like a holiday really.  Surprised to play quite nice this week.  I putted well.  Hit the ball well and kind of accumulated a score without too many mishaps.  It was fun.
