 Q.  And 66 today, bogey-free.  
ROBERT ROCK: Yes, that's the round you want when you're under a bit of pressure.  You don't want too many mistakes and bogeys, and I did play good.  A birdie at the last, that's maybe done the job for me.   
This is a big relief; you play well at the end of the year, when you need to do something like that.  Pleased with that first and foremost.   
 Q.  What was the key out there for you today?  
ROBERT ROCK: I played really well all week, actually.  Drove the ball as good as I have done in a long time and my putting's been good enough.  It's not been amazing but it's been good enough to keep a score going and hole a few putts.   
Yeah, just steady golf but most of my driving's been good.   
 Q.  Enjoy playing with Brian over the week, as well?  
ROBERT ROCK: Yeah, he's a good mate.  We played last year and naturally missed the cut.  We were hoping for better but we didn't have a very good Friday, and the dream is gone.  So we've had two amazing days here.  Couldn't be happier.
