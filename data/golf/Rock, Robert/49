   ROBERT ROCK:  It was awkward all the way round. You have got a lot of things to prepare for each shot. You have got to take advantage of placing the ball within the club length. Moving the tees forward helped but I also hit a lot of fairways so that made it a bit easier. 
 I have probably hit it better in some other rounds. I drove the ball nicely today and my driving is probably something that has let me down this year. I have not been wayward, just missing fairways by a couple of yards, and if you do that on courses like this really takes its toll. As I've said, I've played better but I putted well today and that chuffed me. It's a good score to start with.
