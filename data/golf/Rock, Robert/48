   ROBERT ROCK:  Couple of sixes on the card and didn't play the par fives well early on. Couple of bad drives and three putted the tenth. But then drove really well on the back nine and had some good yardages for wedges and nine irons and managed to hole a few ten footers. It is not that long if you are on the fairway so there are plenty of chances out there.   
  
  Q.  Need a good week to secure your card?   
 ROBERT ROCK:  I have been out here long enough, this is my fifth season and it is not much fun being at the bottom end of the Order of Merit so I will just try and ignore that and then enjoy the fact I am in contention and hopefully I will have a chance going into the last few holes tomorrow. If I play like I did today then I won't be too far away.
