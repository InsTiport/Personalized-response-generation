 Q.   Nice playing.   Just a couple comments on the round?   
PETER TOMASULO:   Just played a solid round of golf.   I'm pretty happy to go around here with no bogeys.  
   
 Q.   The only one in the field, by the way.   
PETER TOMASULO:   Really?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
PETER TOMASULO:   We got a good end of the draw with it calming down late in the day.   I was playing really solid.   I didn't give myself that many testers for par.   Just played really nice.   I hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.  
   
 Q.   Have you played here before?   
PETER TOMASULO:   I played here once before two years ago.  
   
 Q.   You're right now on a medical, right?   
PETER TOMASULO:   Exactly, yeah.  
   
 Q.   So you've got eight events?  
PETER TOMASULO:   No, I only have three events left.  
   
 Q.   You started the year with eight?  
PETER TOMASULO:   I started the year with eight.  
   
 Q.   And you're around 65,000 now?   
PETER TOMASULO:   $65?   
   
 Q.   Thousand?  
PETER TOMASULO:   That I've made this year.   Yeah, I think something like that.  
   
 Q.   So you're going in the right direction with a round like this today?  
PETER TOMASULO:   Yeah, there have been times that I put pressure on myself to try to get this thing quick.   But I'm happy where I'm at.   Worst case scenario is not even that bad.   Sometimes we put way too much stress on ourselves.   
But I'm trying to go out here with a good attitude, trying to swing it well and putt well, and I did both of them well today.  
   
 Q.   You're fully recovered?   What was it, a rib?   
PETER TOMASULO:   That was the original injury, and then I had hip surgery last year.  
   
 Q.   Oh, okay.   
PETER TOMASULO:   I actually had status in 2011, and then I had 13 starts to start last year, but I only got five in last year.  
   
 Q.   But you won on Web.com.   
PETER TOMASULO:   But I won one of my starts on Web.com.   It's been a little bit of a process and moved a little slower than I would have anticipated.   But I feel good about my game, and hopefully I can get out there and keep up some good play.  
   
 Q.   Which hip?  
PETER TOMASULO:   Left hip.
