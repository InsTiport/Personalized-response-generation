Q.  Congratulations on your 1-up victory in the first round.  Is the Walker Cup and your finish in this event in the back of your mind.  Maybe getting selected?
PETER TOMASULO:  Yeah, definitely.  It's out there.  I had a good summer.  I think if I play well I'll be up there in contention for the pick.

Q.  What do you think you have to do to get that pick?  Where do you have to finish?
PETER TOMASULO:  I'm just going to concentrate on keep on winning.  Just try to play one shot at a time and just try to win all my matches.

Q.  That's usually a pretty good way to go.  Congratulations.
PETER TOMASULO:  Thank you.
