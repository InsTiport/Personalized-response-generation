 Q.  3&2 victory, a 6&5 win yesterday, you realize it's not supposed to be this easy out here?  
JONAH TEXEIRA: It's just a blessing for how well I'm playing right now.  I'm not really making that many mistakes.  I kind of just think I only had one or two bogeys yesterday.  I've just been consistent, making pars and I have been making the opponent catch me.   
 Q.  Moving on to the semifinals but you only played it into the field as an alternate?  
JONAH TEXEIRA: I got the call on Tuesday, three days before I flew up and I was pretty stoked.  I didn't think I was going to make it but I was still practicing just in case.  I had a little bit of faith in there and to get in was an absolute, like, I don't know, I can't explain it.   
 Q.  Have you mentally recovered, and now you are where you are, you have a local caddie on the bag.  What's the best piece of advice?  
JONAH TEXEIRA: He's honestly the coolest caddie I've ever met.  He leaves me alone when I really don't need him but sometimes when I do need him, he gives me the proper information and that helps me a lot this whole week.  He's amazing.   
Actually when I got in Saturday, I only played nine holes and I didn't get to play the back ten on South.   
I was like, "Do you know the course?"   
He's like, "Bro, I got you."  It's worked out pretty well so far.
