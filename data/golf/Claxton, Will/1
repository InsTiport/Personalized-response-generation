  WILL CLAXTON:   Very long day.

Q.   Is that going to make a difference to you?   You're a professional golfer, you're used to playing long days. 
WILL CLAXTON:   It's one of those things where we'll see.   I don't know. 
As of right now, I feel pretty good, so we'll see how the day progresses.

Q.   Tell me a little bit about the second round, and start with the eagle that you posted off 115.   We have you at a 39‑foot chip‑in. 
WILL CLAXTON:   I did.   I kind of got a good break because I saw one of my playing competitors hit it on the same line, and I saw just how fast it was, so that was pretty fortunate to get a good idea of the speed coming down there. 

Q.   The course had to play a lot softer. 
WILL CLAXTON:   It did.   No doubt.   It played longer, softer, but we didn't have any mud balls, so that was nice.

Q.   Good luck.   We'll let you get some rest before playing here. 
WILL CLAXTON:   Thanks, guys.
