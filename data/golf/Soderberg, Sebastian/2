Q. How was it?
SEBASTIAN SODERBERG: It was good for the most part. Got off to a good start, birdie, birdie. I was hitting a lot of fairways, a lot of greens. Made a few putts. It was messy towards the end, a few mental errors but a good day.
Q. How key is it on this tough course to get those low numbers early?
SEBASTIAN SODERBERG: I was telling myself -- I mean, I felt confident. I enjoy playing at height. I figured if I just get off to a good start, it's a lot easier to keep it rolling out here. If you kind of get into the wrong, it's tougher to get back. You start not trusting the yardages and stuff.
I felt like I was hitting the numbers really good at the start and that helped me to keep doing that.
Q. Right after two bogeys, how important for momentum into tomorrow was that birdie at the last?
SEBASTIAN SODERBERG: It was actually a par, but yeah, it's all right.
Q. 51st in The Race to Dubai at the moment. How key is it obviously for a good week and is that in your mind leading up to the DP World?
SEBASTIAN SODERBERG: I'm obviously I'm well aware. I'm just looking at it positively. I feel like it's an opportunity to get into Dubai, and if I miss out, it's still a good season for me. A lot has changed the last few months. So for me, I just look at it as a good chance to make it to the final.
Q. Anything you feel you'll go away and work on ahead of a battling day tomorrow?
SEBASTIAN SODERBERG: We'll see. Look through the stats a little bit but overall, it's just a good day. It's like two bad swings towards the ends which cost a few shots, but overall it's looking pretty good out there.
