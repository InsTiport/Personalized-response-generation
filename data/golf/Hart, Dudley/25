Q.  You had the ball rolling out there pretty well today. 
DUDLEY HART:   Yeah, I played a nice, solid round.  I hit the ball real well, only missed one green, and just played real solid.  I had a lot of good birdie opportunities; made some; I missed some.  But I hit a lot of good putts.  So I'm pretty happy. 

Q.  How many holes did you play today? 
DUDLEY HART:   I played 16. 

Q.  Better than coming back and hitting one putt?
DUDLEY HART:   Yeah, played one putt yesterday, two holes.  And then 16 today, plus however many we are going to get in from here.

Q.  Did you go home yesterday and just relax for a while?
DUDLEY HART:   Yeah, I went home for a few hours and just hung out and tried to help out a little. 

Q.  Having won here before, obviously, it gives you probably a little bit of confidence. 
DUDLEY HART:   Yeah, it helps.  It's nice to be able to draw from some memories of the past.  But that was two years ago.  I generally like the golf course, and most of the shots fit my eye pretty well.  So hopefully if I can continue to hit the ball solid the next couple of days, I'll be right there. 

Q.  Do you feel like you're a better player.  Not necessarily in Florida, but on the East Coast?
DUDLEY HART:   I'd definitely rather play on greens like this than the poa annua on the West Coast.  Most guys that I talk to are like that.  They enjoy the bermuda and the bentgrass that we play when we are on the east side a lot more.
