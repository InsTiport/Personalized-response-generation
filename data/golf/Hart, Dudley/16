Q.  Great round, 6 under par, just talk about your final round today.
DUDLEY HART:  Well, I birdied the first hole and gave it Right back on the third hole, and it kind of got boring for a while.  I made a bunch of pars, and starting on No. 9, I birdied 9, 10, got on a pretty good roll there.  Birdied 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, so I got on a roll.  Bogeyed 17, unfortunately.  But, you know, how I felt yesterday and how I felt today were two totally different     it was like two totally different people out there.  Yesterday I didn't know where I was going to hit the ball; I hit three fairways.  I went into on old swing key, and at least I could get in the fairway.  If you can get in the fairway, as good as the greens are, you get up there with a reasonable putt, you have some chances of making some birdies.
Q.  Seeing Vijay at the top of the leaderboard, what does that do for your mind set?
DUDLEY HART:  Pretty tough to catch him.  On this kind of golf course, the greens are soft and they are perfect.  You know, if you don't hit it    if you hit it where you're looking, it's going to go in nine times out of ten.  The best greens you could ever ask to putt on.  With his length, those guys, those upper echelon guys, we can get on most of the par 5s every day, but I'm hitting 3 woods into them or long irons, and they are hitting long irons or mid irons in there.

So that's a huge difference and it's a big advantage.  He's been putting well this week, obviously.  He'd have to play pretty bad.  To be honest with you, I never saw a score board, so I don't know where he's at.  How big of a lead has he got?  Probably a pretty good lead still?
Q.  By five.
DUDLEY HART:  The way he plays and as long as he's been around and how successful he's been, he's not going to back up.
Q.  What does that do to your strategy?
DUDLEY HART:  I never even thought about it to be honest with you.  I just went out there and tried to play as best I could.  I can't control what he's doing.  Chances are he's going to win the tournament and maybe I could run up there and finish behind him.  You know, I started out at 11 under so I was    22 under, if I quit on No. 12, I might have been able to catch him.  You know, winning wasn't really in the back of my mind as much as trying to shoot as low a number as I could.
Q.  Inaudible?
DUDLEY HART:  From a playerÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s standpoint, probably, I don't know how many guys are really thinking about that.  Guys worry about themselves so much and especially when he's got that big of a lead, it's like, well, whatever.  I'm going to just try to go out there and shoot as low as I can and figure out where I finish from there.
Q.  How about that five hole stretch you had?
DUDLEY HART:  Yeah, I just got on a roll and had a couple easy birdies.  I made a long putt, had a couple short putts, and I just hit some good shots. It's probably the easiest stretch of the golf course, you know, that first five holes on the back nine, but you've still got to hit the ball in the right spot and make some putts.  Fortunately I had two tap ins and made a couple good putts from there.
Q.  Overall, is the course drying out?
DUDLEY HART:  It's drying out a little bit, but the greens are still pretty soft.  You know, they will hold pretty much any shot, especially out of the fairway.  Pin placements are pretty good.  There are some that are tougher than others.  A couple of the shorter holes had pins that were harder to get to.  It was not as much of a gimmie birdie as it has been the last couple of days. 18, I got so in on the line, I just said, you know, because I misread the putt on 17, the par putt.  It was a pretty good putt, I just played a little too much break and it kind of 180 ed on me.  I got so into trying to hit it online, I didn't even think about how far away I was or anything like that and I left it about six inches short or something.  I can't complain.  I mean, you go back and say, if you hit every putt over, would you do better or not, I don't know.  You have to take the good shots with the bad shots.
