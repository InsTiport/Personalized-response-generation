 Q.  Is that the hardest, hurry-up-and-wait kind of a deal?  What do you do? 
DUDLEY HART:   It's just every time there's a rain delay, something like that, someone gets a bad break, and it just seemed to be us on last hole.  We just come out here and hit one putt and maybe rather not have to come out this early for one shot, but it has to happen to somebody every time there's a delay like that, and it just happened to be us this time.

Q.  And every shot is important, you can't just come out and lag it around.
DUDLEY HART:   Yeah, you've got to come out  -- we didn't have to hit any balls.  We came out and putt for a few minutes.  It's harder sometimes I think coming out cold in the morning and just going and hitting a putt.  When you're playing, you get into the feel of a round and you get hitting some round putts and you get some feedback going during the round. 
Now coming out this cold in the morning not playing, and having to hit one putt, it can be a little harder this way sometimes.

Q.  How far was the last one, three feet, four feet?
DUDLEY HART:   Yeah.

Q.  You kind of have to make that, but you still shot 67  --
DUDLEY HART:   Yeah, I had a nice round going yesterday.  I didn't want to give away a shot on the last hole.  You know, I would have rather putted yesterday, obviously, because I was feeling good with my putter and rolling it pretty good.  Sometimes you come out the next day and things don't feel quite right sometimes, but I hit a good putt.

Q.  So now what do you do?
DUDLEY HART:   Going to go home and change diapers.  Baby-sit for a few hours.  I'll probably come out here like 2:00  or 3:00  and get stretched, hit some balls.  I don't want to take the whole day off not hitting balls.  Even though we may not play today, I still want to hit some balls and be loose and ready to go tomorrow.
