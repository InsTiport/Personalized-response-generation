 Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  They definitely weren't slow.  Especially playing early, they'll dry out as the day goes on, but I thought it would help us out playing; first off, that the course will play longer, but the greens will be softer, and I didn't find that to be the case.  I didn't see them playing a whole lot softer or slower than the practice rounds.  They did a great job, obviously, designing the greens, so they would drain as well as they do. 
I don't know how much rain we got, but it rained pretty well for a little while, but the greens didn't seem any different than the last couple of days.  You look at a lot of them and the slopes are so subtle.  There are a few that are not so subtle, but for the most part, they're subtle slopes on the greens, but the greens are so fast, that you have to pay attention that when you have a slight downslope the ball is going to run away. 
I was surprised, fortunately, I didn't have too many long putts, but I watched some of the guys -- Steve Pate and Paul Stankowski, they had putts uphill and I was surprised how they ran out even uphill.  They were ripping putts by 6 and 8 feet, when I'm watching them hit it and thought it was a good speed, and it sailed on by the hole.  So that just goes to show you how good the greens are.  They're so tight and so smooth and so perfect, that even uphill putts aren't very slow. 

Q.  Did you feel you could do well this week?
DUDLEY HART:  To be totally honest, coming in the last few days, I had about 8 drivers on the range yesterday about 1:00 trying to find a club.  It wasn't the driver as much as it was my swing.  And fortunately, I worked with my brother-in-law, Mark Wood, a little bit.  And we seemed to get something where I could get control of my ball a little better.  I wasn't driving the ball very well the last week or so, and didn't really have a pattern to it.  I missed one left and I'd miss one right.  My swing felt a little loose.  And fortunately, yesterday afternoon we worked on something, and I took it out on the course today and I figured I might as well try it, because I know swinging normally isn't working too well. 
I had the one swing though and it seemed to work well, I drove the ball pretty well for the most part.  I've got nowhere else to go, I've got to stay with it.  I've gotten the ball in the fairway more often than not, and in the practice rounds, that wasn't the case.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  Yeah, I just commented on that, how my roller-coaster month seems to continue, as far as my golf game goes.  I have a bunch of good holes and then I'll have something crazy happen.  I made a 7 on No. 5, and didn't hit a great tee shot, I was hitting a 3-wood off the tee, trying to get it off the wide part of the fairway, and I pushed it a little bit, I thought it carried the fairway bunker, but I didn't see it bounce.  Steve Pate hit almost the identical shot, and we buried right under the lip.  I hacked it out into the rough and I obviously -- you're not going to get it on the green from 60 or 70 out of the rough.  So, I laid up and the trouble continued.  I didn't quite hit enough club to carry it over the bunker from there, and it made what seemed like an easy 7.  But, fortunately, I didn't get discouraged. 
I was 1-under and playing solid.  I did hit a great tee shot on 10, my first hole.  After that, I drove the ball nice, kept the ball in play, and I hit a bad tee shot there and I walked away with a 7.  But that's what this golf course can do to you and that's what a U.S. Open can do to you, if you miss a shot and catch a little bit of a bad break, you have to be really careful and watch what you're doing or you can make a big number.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  I don't know if there's a key moment.  Like I said, I was just plugging along and playing solid and getting the ball in the fairway, didn't hit a lot of great iron shots out of the fairway, but when I didn't hit it exactly the way I wanted, it was usually in the right spot where I could get it up-and-down or get a reasonable putt out of it.  A lot of the times on this golf course you're trying to survive, kind of certain holes.  You're trying to get it in the fairway, obviously, and hit the ball to a certain spot on the green, because you're hitting a lot of 4-irons, 5-irons and 3-irons, and the greens aren't soft where you can throw it at the flag and stop it.  I can hit the ball pretty high, usually.  But you've got to pick and choose your spots.  And I made -- fortunately made some putts coming in, to rally myself after a bad hole on 5.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  Well, like I said, the course isn't playing a whole lot different.  I didn't find it playing any different than the last few days, which surprised me, but it doesn't surprise me that 1-under is around the lead right now.  It's a very difficult golf course.  You can miss a fairway and you're going to be struggling to make par.  And it's just the same for everybody.  Everybody is going to miss some fairways, and when you're hitting a lot of 5-irons into greens that are still fairly firm and fast, you're not going to have a ton of good birdie opportunities. 
I had some good pins, seemed like a bunch of pins were on the front part of the green, where it was really hard.  You couldn't land the ball short of the hole and let it release to it.  You're hitting it toward the hole and letting it run by and putting back uphill.  It's a tough day, it's a tough golf course.  Everyone is going to have to stay patient and you're going to have some bad holes; when you hit a tee shot in the rough, even when you get it in the fairway, the second shot isn't a gimmie, once you get it in the fairway, the game isn't over, you can't take a breather, you have to keep going.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  I didn't count them up, but I think I missed two fairways -- that's not true, three fairways, first cut on 13, but I don't count that as -- it's a missed fairway, but I can still see the ball, and I can go for the green in two.  Other than that, I guess, technically, I missed three fairways.  If I can go a round and do that all week, I'll be elated.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  That was a bad drive.  I hit it left into the rough and caught a real bad lie, didn't get it back into the fairway and scrambled to make five.  I tried to whack it out, didn't quite carry to the fairway and it stayed in the rough, and I hacked it out about 50 feet, I got it on the green, but it was 50 feet away and I 2-putted.  I was happy to walk away with 5, which I think is a par. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  Coming in on 7, I made about, a probably 25-footer from behind the hole, really fast putt.  The guys I was playing with were laughing, looked like it was going to stop three times, and it kept inching and inching.  It was in a bad spot.  On 8, I made probably about a 18-footer, and then No. 9, I made probably about a 35-footer.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  No, someone else asked me, and I'm glad to be done.  It's a long day, playing 18 holes on this golf course, and I don't want to play 19 or 20.  18 is fine.  If I had to keep going, I would have to go back to No. 10.  And I'd just as soon worry about that hole tomorrow again.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  Well, that's not a really good way to look at it.  You just kind of try to roll with the punches and go out there and just play the best you can on every hole, and sure, I could say if I had hit those 3-putts on the last three holes over again, also, would I make all three of them?  And obviously, none of them were very easy putts.  And one of them was very 3-puttable -- can I say it like that, is that right?  It didn't sound right when I said that.  And you can always look at it that way.  Sometimes you're like, If I hit a good 3-wood off the tee, and didn't plug it in the bunker, if you had to do it all over again, 1-under is a pretty solid round and I'm not going to complain.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  I was pretty comfortable with it.  There's putts that get scary.  Like I said, the greens -- some of the slopes are very subtle, and as fast as the greens are, you have to really watch your pace.  And I was glad that I didn't have any big, long uphill putts like some of the guys did.  At least early on, I tried to watch their speeds on some putts; that can help you see how the ball is reacting, watch them hit it and how the ball rolls out.  I tried to pay attention to that a little bit.  But the pace is so huge on these greens, you don't want to be ripping it 8 feet by, and trying to make it coming back.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  Yeah, well, especially at 7:15 in the morning.  I wouldn't mind -- I think it's definitely easier starting on that hole at noon.  At 7:15, it's 55, 58 degrees, it's cool and the ball is not going to jump off the club like it will at noon when it's even 65, whatever it is now.  But early in the morning, the ball just doesn't go as far and it's not going to run as much, obviously, in the fairway.  So it plays longer.  But that was just how the draw came out.  Those holes aren't easy no matter what.  You've got to play them at some point. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  Not really.  I didn't really worry about it.  Like I said, you've got to play the hole, the hole is hard no matter what.  Instead of 12 o'clock, it might be playing ten yards shorter.  So instead of hitting a 2-iron in, you're hitting a 3-iron in.  So it's still hard.  It's a long hole and you've got to play them at some point.  And it's just --

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  Well, it was disappointing, because I hadn't really felt like -- I didn't hit a great tee shot on 10, I didn't hit a great one on 12.  But after that, I really had a pretty good command of my tee shots.  And didn't really hit a terrible shot on 5.  I just pushed it a little bit.  But didn't carry the bunker.  And it was disappointing to make 7 there.  But I knew I had to stay patient.  I knew that the scores aren't going to be real low this week, chances are.  I'm 2 over par, hang in and try to make a couple of birdies coming in, and stay patient.  If you lose your confidence and lose your composure for too long out here, you can shoot some high numbers, and it can happen quick. 
And keeping my composure, some of you guys know, is not my strong suit.  But that was one of the things I told myself is just try to stay in there, because you're going to hit some bad shots and you're going to make some bogeys, but hopefully, you can make enough birdies to offset some of those mistakes.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  No, they were well-behaved.  Granted it was pretty early, so they didn't -- not too many people were on the course yet.  But it was -- I didn't notice anything any different from any other tournament.  The fans were fine.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  I made about a 25-footer on No. 11 for birdie.  But other than that, that was -- I made a couple of short -- I had -- I made a couple of short ones, 2 footers.  But actually, one two-footer for birdie.  But other than that, that was it. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
DUDLEY HART:  Ten, 10 drivers.  It's too long, some of those holes, if you hit 3-wood, you might have another 3-wood in, some of those holes.  I felt pretty decent with the driver, so you can't play too scared.  There are certain holes that I could have hit driver on 5, maybe, but it just -- it sets up better for a 3-wood for me, even though it didn't work out well for me today, I'll probably hit 3-wood tomorrow unless it's into the wind.  It sets up better for me.  It's set up differently for different guys, and the driver just doesn't seem to fit in that fairway. 
On that particular hole, I lose -- the fairway runs out of where my eye kind of takes me.  I want to try to hit 3-wood in the wide spot.  But there aren't many holes -- you can hit 3-wood on 1.  2, you can hit whatever you want, really, anything other than driver, probably.  But all those other holes, you've got to try to hit driver and get the ball in the fairway, I think.
