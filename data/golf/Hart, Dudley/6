  Q. You're still in the mix, but 70 is not what you wanted; did you miss some opportunities?   
 DUDLEY HART: Not today. I just didn't have too much. I still struggled ball-striking-wise a little bit today, probably the worst day, and I didn't hit any good iron shots really.   
 So all in all, really looking back at it, where I played some of my shots from, 70 is not bad. Hopefully I can go to the range now and try to find something that work with for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What's it going to take tomorrow?   
 DUDLEY HART: It depends on weather; depends on wind. I'm not going to really worry about a number. I'm just going to try to follow the shots, and I feel like my putter is working pretty well for the most part. And if I can get myself some more opportunities, I feel confident that I can make some.   
  
  Q. Good memories here can't hurt.   
 DUDLEY HART: That's true, I've played well before, but hopefully I can do a little better than I've done in the past.
