 Q.  You have a good start with 11 straight pars and then made no bogeys and four birdies.  What was going well?  
SCOTT VERPLANK: I drove it pretty straight.  I hit all the fairways except for one, and that was in the first cut late in the round.  I was in good position, not great position. I didnât hit it close the first nine holes.â   
 Q.  The birdies on 12, 13 and 14 â three in a row -- had to be a good feeling?  
SCOTT VERPLANK: I made a bunch of pars in a row, and I made a really good save on 11.  Then on 12, I hit it to 3 feet.  On 13 I hit it to 10 feet and made that.  And then on 14, I hit it to 15 feet and just missed the putt for eagle.   
 Q.  Were conditions a little soft?  
SCOTT VERPLANK: It was a little bit soft, but it was a little more cloudy and humid.  So Iâd say we had good scoring conditions today.   
 Q.  What are your expectations after a first round 66?  
SCOTT VERPLANK: I think that if I continue to play well, I hope that I will be in the mix and give myself a chance.  But it is only one round.  I have to keep it going.  I am feeling better and playing better.
