   SCOTT VERPLANK: Had a great day, actually. All three of us in our group played very well. You know, I hit a lot of good shots, made a couple of mistakes, but I holed one from the fairway from 150 yards and then I made about a 50-foot putt on No. 2 for an eagle, so I had two eagles in one round, and I can't remember doing that probably ever. That always helps. That always helps the scorecard when you do that.

 Q. There always seem to be young golfers and guys who haven't necessarily been in contention jump up there for a round during this tournament. But having the experience that you do, is that going to help you maintain? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK: You know what, it could. But the best thing my experience will do is just to play my game, be patient and not try to -- if you try to make something happen, a lot of times it ends up backfiring. 
 The golf course was pretty gettable this morning. It rained a little bit last night, guess, and the greens were a little bit softer than I thought they were going to have. Still very fast, but the golf course will probably only get tougher. Although today there's no wind, either, which I've never played here with really no wind. If the wind picks up, the golf course will definitely get tougher.

 Q. At this point can you have any kind of a guess on what the course is going to play like when you get out there tomorrow?
 SCOTT VERPLANK: No, it depends on the weather. If it stays real humid and the wind doesn't blow, then it's not going to play as difficult as if the wind starts blowing and it dries out more. You've still got to hit good shots around here.
