 Q.  Scott, you said you kept going forward, I guess that's the best thing you say about a 69 after a 66? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK: I just made a couple of mistakes today that around a golf course like this you would rather not have.  You know, pretty solid.  Most of the time I was where I wanted to be.  Like I said, I just had a couple of mess-ups and compounded it on No. 18, which was my 9th hole.  It felt pretty good. 

 Q.  Do you feel good about where you're going to be going into the weekend, obviously knowing there's still a whole afternoon to play? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK: It just depends on what everybody shoots.  I'm doing the right thing.  I could be a little tighter with what I'm going to do the next two days, but hopefully I'll show up and get going where I want to go. 

 Q.  There's NASCAR analogies to be made here.  Are you just trying to tighten up the setup a little bit?  You're in the lead draft, you're just hanging with the pack? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  That's probably about right.  I just need to tighten up everything a little bit and get it sharper.  I'm driving it good, but not like I'd like to.  Things are really close, though. 

 Q.  This is a great putting golf course, isn't it?  If you can get the ball rolling well, and feel confident about your putter, great things can happen, can't they? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  Yes, you have to make putts around here.  This morning the greens putted better than they did yesterday afternoon, which was nice, and I expect them to get better as the next two days roll along? 

 Q.  Are you hoping for a little bumpiness this afternoon while everybody is still out here? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  That's what we had yesterday afternoon, so I guess that's what they deserve this afternoon.
