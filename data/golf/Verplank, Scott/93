Q.   Right now you're about five shots out of the lead.  Talk about your day.  Nice to play with some decent weather, huh?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  Finally, it wasn't raining.  It's still awful wet, so the golf course is still playing really long, but I'm hitting the ball straight.  I hit my irons pretty good today and had some really good chances.  I really just haven't putted any good.  Unfortunately I haven't been putting very good the last month or so.  Just like the last hole I got an uphill six, seven footer for birdie after hitting a really nice iron shot.  It didn't really even sniff making it.  Maybe I'll get it rolling tomorrow.
Q.   In other words, if you get the putter rolling, a 65, 66 is out there for you?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  Well, if I hit it like I did today, and I birdied the first three holes, but I hit it a foot on 1 and I hit it six feet my second shot on 2, and I could have easily made 3 there, and then I hit it about eight feet on 3, and then that was kind of the end of making any putts.

I made about a ten footer     I hit it about three feet on 14 and made about a ten footer on 15.  I'm close.  I'm very close.  If some of those putts would go in, then I could hopefully shoot a low round.
Q.   You mentioned it's still wet out there so it's obviously very beneficial to have the ball in your hand on a day like today.
SCOTT VERPLANK:  No question.  Any time we play it up, it's beneficial to drive the ball straight, and it's still really in the low spots very wet.  There's still casual water.  But all in all, it's holding up pretty good.
Q.   Any final thoughts about tomorrow?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  Try and make a lot of birdies and see if I can catch up a little bit.
