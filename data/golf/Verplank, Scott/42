 Q.  Scott, reports that you're not feeling too good, I have to say, you you've looked better in your golfing career? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  I have, I've felt better, but I obviously hope I either improve quite a bit tonight and I'm ready to go tomorrow. 

 Q.  Disappointing, obviously, the stomach bug has affected you, I presume you were looking forward to playing here. 
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  Absolutely.  I've been looking forward to coming to this tournament for the last two or three months. 
 It's a long way over here to come over here and not even going to get to see the golf course before the first round which I'm a little disappointed in.  But I couldn't walk one hole, much less 18 right now. 

 Q.  Disappointing, because obviously it's a good field here this week. 
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  It's a great field.  It looks like it's shaping up to be a great tournament.  You know, maybe I'll have a little resurgence and get back to where I can play like I normally do and enjoy the week.
