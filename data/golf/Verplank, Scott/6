 Q.  Talk about what went well for you today.  SCOTT VERPLANK: What went well today was I was really patient.  Kind of hung in there.  Made some pretty good saves on the front nine.  And then started hitting it a little bit better on the back, but I hit it close a couple times for birdies and I made one nice putt on 11. Other than that, I just kind of kept parring it to death.  And I didn't drive it very good, so I'm going to need to drive it a little bit better tomorrow to have a real shot. But the course is so hard that pars are not awful on most holes.  There's not a whole lot of birdie holes.  So, just hanging in there and being patient is huge.   Q.  There was some good scores in the morning, and did you think that maybe the course was going to yield some more of that or can you get into that mode of attacking it out there?  SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, you know, I know there wasn't any wind at all early, which obviously helps.  But like I said, there's not a whole lot of attacking on this golf course.  You can do a little bit, but, boy, some of the holes, you're putting yourself in tremendous amount of peril with your score if you get too aggressive. So, the weather's finally nice and the course is drying out, so there are some better scores.  But it's a hard golf course, there's no way around it.   Q.  You have to like your position as hard as this golf course is, to at least maybe be two or three shots off the lead heading into the last round.  SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, yeah, I am where I am.  I would rather be leading by eight, but I'm not. But I'm doing okay.  Hopefully, I'll improve a little bit tomorrow physically with how I was hitting it and give myself a real chance.
