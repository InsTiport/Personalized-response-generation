   SCOTT VERPLANK: I think anything under par on this golf course is a good score obviously. I got going pretty good for a little short stretch on the front nine. Made three birdies out of four holes, which I think around here, you kind of have to get on little stretches like that, because some of the stretches of holes are just going to beat you up. 
 There's just too many long, hard holes in a row in different little parts of this golf course. So very happy to shoot under par.

 Q. How big was the par save on 18?
 SCOTT VERPLANK: It was huge. Normally it would be to get like 30 minutes more sleep, but I think the tee times are going to be late so I won't have to worry about that.
 Hey, any time you save a shot -- I was definitely saving a shot. I pushed my tee shot a little bit and just made it into the bunker and had nothing, just had to lay up. Didn't hit a great wedge, but had an 18-, 20-footer up the hill and any time you save a shot, that's big. 

 Q. Well, going into the weekend tomorrow, do you feel any pressure to shoot a low score?
 SCOTT VERPLANK: You know, if I can just keep getting on some of those little short, quick bursts that I've been able to get on, make two or three birdies out of three or four holes, and then really, you almost have to just kind of limit the damage; if you get in that position. 
 I did a pretty good job of that today. I got a little bit -- got a little tired and a little worn down on the back nine but kind of limited the damage coming in. So, a good night's sleep and I'll be kind of refocused and refreshed tomorrow.
