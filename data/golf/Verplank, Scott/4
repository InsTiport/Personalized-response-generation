Q. For starters, I know you eagled 16.
SCOTT VERPLANK: Yeah, thank goodness.  The rest of it wasn't very good.
Q. Just go through that hole and, specifically, do you remember the club and distance?
SCOTT VERPLANK: Yeah.  I hit a tee shot down there, right side of the fairway, 147 yards.  Hit an 8 iron, just like one-hopped right in the hole.
Q. Then just really quickly, do you mind going through the weekend?
SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, obviously, it's a tough week with the weather and all that.  I'm thrilled that we're going to get done today.  That was huge because it's hard to stick around an extra day when you're ready to play Thursday through Sunday.  But happy that we're done.
