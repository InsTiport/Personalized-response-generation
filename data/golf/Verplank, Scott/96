SCOTT VERPLANK:  I scored very well.  I didn't hit it quite as solid and as straight as I wanted to, but the conditions were very tough until the last two or three holes, and the wind kind of died down a little bit, which helped.

When we teed off the wind was really blowing, and the greens were really hard and fast.  But I'm very pleased with 4 under.
Q.  You're doing great in a number of categories this year, especially early on.  Is there a difference in your play the beginning of this year than there was at the end of last year at all?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  Well, not from the end of last year.  I have a 4th, 2nd and a 9th for the last three tournaments I played at the end of last year.

So luckily for me, going home for two months and sitting in cold weather didn't seem to bother me too bad.  I've had another three pretty good tournaments out of the five I've played.  So I just want to keep doing the same stuff.
Q.  How is the course playing this year as opposed to years past at THE PLAYERS?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  Fortunately it's dry, so it's playing shorter, but the rough is thick, and like I said, the greens are so fast and firm.  If it keeps drying out, the scores won't be so low here the end of the week.


End of FastScripts.
