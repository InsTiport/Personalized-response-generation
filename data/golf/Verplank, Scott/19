  Q. Jordan Spieth, you have a special perspective having won as an amateur in' 85. Can you compare that to what he's accomplishing here at the age of 16?   
 SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, I don't think so. At 16 I wasn't going off to do what he's doing. That's pretty impressive that he's in the last five or six groups on a Sunday TOUR event, and the fact that he's from Dallas and from Brookhaven, where I grew up. I've talked to him a couple of times when we had a charity event. Very nice young man, and obviously he has a bright future in golf.   
  
  Q. It's amazing he's able to handle the pressure and the crowds.   
 SCOTT VERPLANK: That's what is great about him. Golf is looking to the next generation of kids that can play, stay out of trouble and entertain everybody, so obviously Rickie Fowler, these younger guys are coming up and Jordan has all the tools to help the game of golf, and he's gotten a lot of people out here this week.
