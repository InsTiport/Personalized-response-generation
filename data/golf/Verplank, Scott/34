  Q. Finally got through Round 2, 2-under. Been kind of a long week so far. Got to feel good about your position. Three back. Just comment on the game, how you're looking forward to going into what's left this weekend.  
 SCOTT VERPLANK: I'm looking forward to getting a little bit of rest between now and later this afternoon when we re-tee it. I'm playing good. I'm not hitting it as good as I'd like to or I'm used to. I'm getting the ball in the hole and clipping and putting good. That's always a good start. If I start hitting it a little bit better, I might be onto something.
