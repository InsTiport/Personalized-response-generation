 Q. On a Sunday a lot of times you just want to give yourself a chance and you did that with a spectacular hole-out on the 16th. Talk about that birdie. 
 SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, I was very lucky. I hit my 4th terrible drive in a row on the 16th hole. For some reason I never had it figured out on where to hit it off the tee. But just got it up there in the bunker. Had obviously a tough shot, it was all luck. But I hit a great shot. When I hit it I thought it was going to be close. I never saw it go in because I was too far below the hole. But yeah, that got me where -- I had no idea what Jason was doing, but obviously I knew it got me up there a little bit closer, and then the next hole came.

 Q. Just one of those things that happens, but talk about how difficult this golf course was because the wind today was out of a direction you guys had never seen it before. 
 SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, it wasn't that much different. The thing that kind of got me on 17 is it switched. That storm got close and it switched a couple times right there on 16 and 17. The wind should have been in from the left on 17, and for some reason my ball started hooking. I mean, I started right at the flag, and if anything, I thought it would probably cut since I normally cut it a little bit, and the wind should have been helping it left to right, and it started hooking. I don't know how. I don't know what it did. But I was a little shocked. 

 Q. You've got to be pretty proud of yourself for this week. 
 SCOTT VERPLANK: Yeah, I did a nice job being patient, hanging in there. I played all week without my wrist really bothering me. I don't know what happened. It's been a long time since that's happened, but I really felt pretty good. I wouldn't say that I played my best golf, but I hung in there and got a decent score.
