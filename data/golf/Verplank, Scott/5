 Q.  Overall, what are your thoughts on the day?  SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, actually it was a beautiful day.  We got great weather, it ended up.  Myself, I just have been driving the ball so poorly that I really had no chance.  I had some really good chances early in the first six or eight holes to make birdies and I didn't make any putts, so I was just kind of holding on through there. But obviously Colin got going really good and got way ahead and when I didn't birdie four of the first six like I probably should have, then I was done.   Q.  What are your thoughts overall on your performance over the four days?  SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, everything other than hitting tee balls, it was pretty good.  I actually hit a lot of greens, hit a lot of greens out of the rough.  Chipped and putted well.  It was fun to be here.  It was fun to play.  Got a little confidence in everything, except my driving.   Q.  With the difficulty of the course, what are your thoughts on what Colin has been able to do over the last few days?  SCOTT VERPLANK: Well, obviously, Colin -- you know what?  If you hit the ball straight here and hit it in the fairway, that's, I wouldn't say it's half the battle, but that's a big advantage.  The greens are difficult and tricky and all that, but Colin hits the ball really solid and really straight.  I played with him last week and I can see him hitting lots of fairways, lots of greens.
