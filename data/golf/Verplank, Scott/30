  Q. It was a rather long day. How do you keep your mind in it seven-and-a-half hours?   
 SCOTT VERPLANK: Obviously the seven-and-a-half hours you're sitting around you don't have your mind on golf. You try not to. You just sit around, you know, go to the trailer a couple times, stretch.   
 I saw a lot of guys working out in the delay. I ate two or three meals, which everybody did.   
 You know what, if you play out here long enough, you're going to have some days like this, so you kind of figure out what to do, and just go with it. That's the way it is.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 SCOTT VERPLANK: No. I played better. I really -- I hit the ball -- I didn't hill it really as crisp as I like to, but I think I only missed one green, and felt a little shaky with the putter on the first three holes where I had pretty decent looks at birdie and didn't hit the kind of putts I like.   
 And I got two or three hours of putting on the putting green over there and kind of got it worked out, and when I came back, I started making them.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 SCOTT VERPLANK: Absolutely. Putting the ball up, which you kind of have to because the fairways are still a lot of casual water, and the greens are holding.   
 I played nine holes Tuesday and it was kind of firm and fast, and you know, it was pretty difficult. The greens get pretty small when they're real firm, but being soft it kind of opens up the golf course a little bit, and you can be a little more aggressive.
