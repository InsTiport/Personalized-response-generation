 Q. Great playing today. So far you've got the low round of the day. Just a few keys what led to it. 
 SCOTT VERPLANK: Soft conditions. I hit the ball a lot better today than I have the first couple days. Obviously yesterday was somewhat of a disaster. I hit the ball in the fairway and hit a lot of nice iron shots and made a few putts. It wasn't real difficult. I hit it pretty close most of the time I made birdie.

 Q. Did you start on 1?
 SCOTT VERPLANK: No, I started on 10.

 Q. Eagle at 1, what did you hit in?
 SCOTT VERPLANK: 4-iron about three feet.

 Q. Were the greens rolling --
 SCOTT VERPLANK: Greens were great. They're as good as I've ever seen them here, they really are, even with all the rain. A lot of times they get real bumpy and marked up when it's wet, but they're hanging in there as good as I've ever seen.

 Q. With the original weather forecast today looking like it was going to be bad again, how much of an anxiety factor was there just to try to get the round in?
 SCOTT VERPLANK: You know, I didn't really have much. After yesterday it could have done anything today and it wouldn't have been as bad as yesterday. Just kind of, let's just go play, and then I heard the system kind of broke up a little bit, so we were lucky. I'm happy we got finished. I wasn't sure we were going to when we started.
