SCOTT VERPLANK:   He made about a 50-footer on the first hole.  I looked like I was in good shape, I had about a 15-footer straight uphill, straight in and he made about a 50-footer and I missed. 
But we were  -- I made a couple.  I won 5 and then I hit it about an inch on No. 7.  Then I bogeyed 8 to get back to even. 
Then I actually played pretty decent.  I birdied 11.  I made about a 25-footer on 11.
Had a 4-footer to win the hole on 12 and missed it.
Then I hit it four feet on the next hole and made it. 
Hit it four feet on 15 and made it.
And then parred 16.

Q.  Hitting your irons pretty well?
SCOTT VERPLANK:   I played pretty well.  I hit some shots nice and close to the hole, which is always nice to do. 

Q.  How were you feeling coming in? 
SCOTT VERPLANK:   Yeah, I mean, I just  -- I feel fine.  I feel like I just  -- you know, the way I'm going to have success in this kind of game is to play my own game and it doesn't really matter  -- I don't play the other guy.  I just play my own deal.  And if I play well, then I'll be okay.

Q.  Do you feel like this is a momentum-builder? 
SCOTT VERPLANK:   Yeah, you've got to win, so, yeah, obviously you want to get by the first one.  The last few match-plays, I've lost tomorrow.
