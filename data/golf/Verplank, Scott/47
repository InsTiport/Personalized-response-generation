   SCOTT VERPLANK:  I was a little scrappy and then found something and started hitting the ball quite a bit more solid.   
  
  Q.  What was it?   
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  Basically I was just getting quick from the top and being too steep.  So I just to just slow it down and be more shallow and hit the ball from the inside a bit more and the stroke got better.   
  
  Q.  On the 16th, you said it felt like a hockey game had broken out; just an unbelievable atmosphere?   
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  It is.  The crowd has been unbelievably great.  I think it's as great an event as they have ever had in Canada.  The crowd has been awesome, very supportive of internationals and supportive of us, too.  I loved it.   
  
  Q.  You have assembled an unbelievable record, especially in this particular tournament, 4-0-0; what happens to Scott Verplank on this week?   
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  You know, I just love playing team golf.  I have a pretty good record in the Ryder Cup, and I have a pretty good record in this just because I enjoy it so much.  I feel like I'm a pretty good teammate and I know how to pick good teammates, too.  This is a great event.  I love the other one, too, really enjoy playing it.  Hope I get to play a few more.
