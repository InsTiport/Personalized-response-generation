Q.
What's the hat?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  They make the insulin that I take, diabetic products.
Q.  Course playing tougher today?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  With the wind blowing, it makes it a little harder to have great control of your golf ball, but it's    the way it's set up, if you drive it in the fairway, you're going to have a perfect lie and you ought to be able to have a chance to get in there somewhere where you have a makeable putt.  If you don't hit it in the fairway or you're missing greens, you get some pretty gnarly lies, and that's where the difficulty comes in.
Q.  How important is it to respond here after 17?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  Well, it's always nice to birdie the last hole, regardless of what it is, but particularly this one.  This is a tough finishing hole, 240 yards.  After the way I chopped up 17, I was happy to get it in there where I had a makeable putt and I actually made it.
Q.  The iron or whatever it was off the tee here
SCOTT VERPLANK:  On 18, 5 wood.
Q.  You don't hit too many of those outside of the majors on too many occasions?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  Yeah, well, I really like my 5 wood, so all the long holes, if I have a 5 wood in, I'm okay.
Q.  What is it about this event that brings out the best in you?
SCOTT VERPLANK:  Well, I think it's the golf course.  It's a great golf course.  Generally, like I said, it's a place where if you drive it in the fairway, you'll have some attacking irons in your hand on several holes.  Normally I putt pretty well and these greens have always    since '98, the first time we played here, the greens have always been fantastic.
