  Q.  Regarding the conditions.   
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  It was pretty cold this morning.  The golf course is really firm.  I guess they didn't water the fairways, which really helped me.  But the greens and the area around the green are going to be very hard.  I'm very happy to be done.   
 Hopefully the wind will start whipping here in a little bit.   
 It is the fastest I've seen the greens since I've played them here.  And this is my 12th Masters.  Today, par is a good score.   
 They were smart in moving the tee up.  They didn't max it out.   
 This is a long, hard golf course for me, but it's a lot of work.  Every shot is on the edge.
