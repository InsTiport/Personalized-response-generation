Q: So, 10 under.  How do you feel?
SO YEON JANG: Overall, my shots didnât feel particularly solid, but my putts fell really well and gave me a number of birdies.
There were some risky moments, but I think a bit of luck during those moments helped me end with a good score.
Q: Playing this morning, how was that?
SO YEON JANG: I wasnât able to finish my two last holes yesterday, but I went into today thinking, Letâs play the same as yesterday.
