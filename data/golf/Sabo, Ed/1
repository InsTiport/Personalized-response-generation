  Q. Describe the overall experience of the week and some of the highlights of your round today?  
 ED SABO: I had no highlights today and I always enjoyed these tournaments. I didn't play too good. I don't really have anything for you.   
  
  Q. What was your transition like from the morning tee time to or from the afternoon yesterday to the morning tee time today?  
 ED SABO: Well I think it's just two different days. I did all right today. It's all right today. It's not blowing today. I don't know what it was like in the morning, I wasn't here. It was windy yesterday afternoon. I don't know, it's, it seems to be a little bit better today than it was afternoon yesterday.  
  
  Q. Your overall preparation, was there anything in terms of your game that you made with the altitude or not?  
 ED SABO: Well it would be nice if you could figure that out. There's a difference, but I didn't have enough time to figure it out.
