Q. Really tough conditions today.  How did you feel about your round out there?
ALLY McDONALD: You know, when I got a couple holes in, if you would have told me that I was going to shoot 1-under, I would have probably been pretty happy with that.  It was a grind.  It was just a constant try to hang on, hit good shots.  Sometimes it was just settling for somewhere in the middle of the green with downwind shots.  They're really hard to hold the greens.  So just stayed really patient, and yeah, I'm really -- even though I wasn't able to win, I gave myself a great chance, and that's all I could ask for.
Q. What do you learn from a day like today, especially the way you battled back and really stayed in contention all day?
ALLY McDONALD: I was very resilient.  I mean, a 1-under score doesn't maybe say resilience, but just the conditions as a whole, I think you could ask everybody who played today, the wind was brutal.  Some of the holes played super long.  I hit a 3-wood into hole 2 today.  So it was just a grind, and I knew looking at the forecast coming in, with the wind being up, it was going to be a grind.  So I think I was mentally prepared for it.  I wish I could have rolled that putt in on 17 and then hit a better drive on 18, but Lexi made a great putt for eagle.  Everything happens for a reason.  I'm just happy that I was able to be in contention.  It felt great, and I'm really proud of myself.
Q. More Solheim Cup points, so you keep plugging along.
ALLY McDONALD: Yeah, that's obviously really big.  I want to get a win more than anything, but the more I can be in this situation, the better prepared I'm going to be if I'm going to get on Solheim.
