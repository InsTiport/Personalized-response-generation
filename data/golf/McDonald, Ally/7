Q. (Indiscernible).  Best birthday present ever?
ALLY MCDONALD:   It's definitely top for sure.
Q. How were you able to handle things when they got close, especially the four-shot lead and just two holes.
ALLY MCDONALD:   I'm not going to lie, it shook me up pretty bad.  I had to gather myself and get my heart rate under control after I made bogey on 13 and Danielle went back to back on birdies on 13 and 14.
So I just told myself to calm down and do what I've been doing every single round, and that is just trying to execute my game plan, control what I can.
I knew from the start that Danielle was going to hang in there.  You kind of go to match play mode and you think absolutely she's going to put the pedal down.
So I was just happy to hang in there and pull it out.
Q. You believed you could do this, but until you do it you don't truly know, do you?  You had some incredible shots when things got tight.  What you did learn about yourself?
ALLY MCDONALD:   Just the resiliency that I have.  I've never doubted my ability, but I've definitely questioned whether I would be able to win out here.  It's really hard to win out here.
So I've just really hung in there and tried to stick to my process since day one.  That was able to get me in the winner's circle today.  I'm really thankful.
Q. Congratulations.  Happy birthday.
ALLY MCDONALD:   Thank you.
