 Q.  7-under day.  Round of the tournament for Ally McDonald here at the Founders Cup.  Take us through today.  You had an eagle, a ton of birdies, and you really vaulted up the leaderboard.  What was working for you?  
ALLY McDONALD: I hit it really well, which I feel like I really struggled with the first two days.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities for birdie and was able to convert.   
I missed a short putt on No. 2, which I really wanted to get out to a good momentum.   
But birdied 5 and hit several really good shots throughout the day to give myself a good opportunity for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Tell us about 11, the eagle.  
ALLY McDONALD: Hit really good drive.  I think I had 222 to the pin.  It was a little downwind.  I hit a solid 4-iron to about nine feet and rolled it in.   
 Q.  How you feeling?  Give people an update.  We wrote a story on LPGA.com about what happened to you in Malaysia.  How are you feeling?  
ALLY McDONALD: I'm doing great.  It was a tough couple weeks after that.  I was just happy to make it to CME.  Still kind of recuperated a lot after that.   
Got a full clean bill of health from my doctors and trained really hard in the off-season to maybe prepare my body for a little bit more of what I didn't know I was going to go through this last year.   
I'm healthy and excited for the year.  Ready to play some good golf.   
 Q.  Give me a thought on tomorrow.  Pretty exciting.  You're near the top.  You'll have a shot.  
ALLY McDONALD: Yeah, this is a really low-scoring golf course.  I did all I can do.  Saturday you can just play the best you can and put yourself in a good position.  I did that, and I'm sure the lead will move further away.   
Like I said, I did what I could do today; tomorrow go try to do it again.
