 Q.  4-under today after birdieing 18.  Tell us how you feel coming off the golf course today.  
ALLY McDONALD: Really good.  I hit it really well.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities for birdie.  Could have been lower.  I gave one back on 16 after hitting all 18 greens, made a silly three-putt.  But all in all, I'm really excited, really happy that I got a good score in with great conditions today.  Looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  You mentioned the conditions; I think we feel it starting to roll in.  How much do you think it's going to affect the golf course out there?  
ALLY McDONALD: You know, you never know.  I think it definitely plays more difficult with wind, but these are the top players in the world, so anybody can shoot a score I think even in tough conditions.  But getting out early was good.  I think I saw a lot of the golf course before the wind came in, so I'm happy with my score, happy to get some lunch here in just a little bit, and then take the rest of the day to kind of hang out and be ready to go tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're coming into your second week here in Scotland, your first full year on Tour.  Tell me how you're feeling after these two weeks here in Scotland?  
ALLY McDONALD: I'm feeling good.  I was feeling really good Thursday after I shot 2-under in the Scottish, and then Friday I hit it really bad.  It was really tough conditions over there, so I tried to cut myself a little slack playing my first week of links golf.  But it's great to be over here playing a different style of golf.  This course is amazing.  Kingsbarns is great.  We have a great setup this week, so I'm just really looking forward to finishing the week off strong.
