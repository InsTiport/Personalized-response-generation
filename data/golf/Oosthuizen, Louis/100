 Q.  How would you describe how you've played these first two days?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, it's been great.  Yesterday was a big positive for us and coming into today, we were both playing nicely.  Every time the one made a mistake, the other one lifted us up.  That was the key today.  And then some clutch putts, the putt Louis made on the 8th hole was a big turnaround for us and just rode the momentum from there.   
 Q.  You guys won yesterday and then got a chance to come out first today.  What was in your mind when you got the call to lead the team this morning?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I think it was pretty clear for us what he wanted from us.  Get a blue number up there.  We needed to start strong and get a point and get the team to see that.   
 Q.  1-down through seven, how were you able to flip this match on the Americans?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I think the putt on 8 was a massive momentum changer, and Branden holed two beautiful ones on 9 and 10.   
So yeah, that got us really going.  And the whole time, if you play against guys like Dustin and Jordan, you need to think they are going to make everything all the time, and that was our mind-set.  We never let the foot off the accelerator.  We were pushing the whole time and we played really good.   
 Q.  How important was it to take this team down and maybe more importantly put an early point on the board for your team?  
BRANDEN GRACE: Yeah, big time.  Pricey had the idea to get us up in there because we had a good one yesterday and try to lead the whole team from the front, and you know, that was a big thing for us to put the blue number in there early on, and we managed to do that.   
Hopefully gives the guys a little motivation behind us and hopefully press on for the last couple holes.
