Q. Was it playing soft and kind of long? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: You know, it's probably as easy as it's going to play today. I hit 4âirons to the greens where it plugged, I hit 7âwood into a green and it plugged. I don't think we'll ever get an opportunity to go at pins like that. Very different to what we're used to playing. Yeah, it was playing a little longer but not as much as I thought it would be. But yeah, definitelyââ it was tricky on the greens because you know what it used to do and all of a sudden you've got to hit it a lot firmer, and think it was a little tricky putting on the greens. 

Q. (On having no patrons.) 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, we hit great shots considering there was no one cheering us on. That was the weirdest thing. You know, we got used to it through the practice rounds, different lines off tees where you could actually see a little more, especially when you're standingââ like if you're on the 8th tee box now, you've got to wait for the guys on 17 to putt, and normally there's never a problem because you've got that grandstand there. But yeah, it's different. We all miss the patrons here.
