Q. Probably the finish you wanted, but opening bogey, closing birdie. Pretty adventurous round for you, wasn't it?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah. Felt like I was really lucky on 1. I pitched it on the downslope in the bunker and it stayed there, and had absolutely no shot, and ended up leaving myself 10 feet for par and missed that, so not the start I wanted. But just fought it out really, and still a lot of work to do. I'm struggling finding a driver that I'm comfortable with, so you'll see me a few times in places that I'm normally not at, but yeah, I'm fighting it out, and I've done a good job on the greens today.
Q. Let's talk about this golf course. The breeze has picked up a little bit as the day went on. Did that make it more difficult?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It did. You know, you're not sure always to -- especially downwind, how much more do you take because it goes so far. All of a sudden you go from 10 to 15 to sometimes even a little bit more percent for the elevation, and into the wind, then you don't know -- you don't really want to hit it too low because you still want the ball to stay in the air for the altitude. It's tough, but I think I've played -- I think a lot of guys have played here a while now, every year coming here, that you sort of know what to expect, and you're going to have shots that go a long way and you're going to have shots that surprise you by going short. You just need to fight it out around here.
