LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Well, I don't know.  I just -- I felt over the past years I've been too aggressive maybe in the early matches and didn't put the pressure on.
Q. How important is 10 to get the momentum back?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, 8 and 9, I lost concentration and it cost me two holes.  It was important to start the back nine well, to try and get 2-up or 3-up in the last five holes.  I was playing well enough to force a little bit there on 10.
Q. And 14?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I fired a really good line, but it came up just a bit short.
Q. (Inaudible.)
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, he's probably at the moment the world No. 1.  He's definitely tomorrow world No. 1.  It's going to be a tough match.  I need to play well.  He's not going to give me any holes.  I need to go out and make birdies.  Up to now I could get away with pars and winning holes, but I need to make birdies.
