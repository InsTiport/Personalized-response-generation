Q. Really nice finish there. Kind of an up and down day for you, huh?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah. Played the par-5s not great. I thought I sort of blew it on 14 with a horrible layup behind the trees and end up making a bogey and you know, finished nicely.
It was a week like just when I started doing something good some way I make a stupid mistake. I don't know. I think end of the season mind all over the place. I need to do something to just get everything straight for next week, if I'm in.
Q. On that note, with bouncing up and down in the standings or the sort of having an up and down day, what are the emotions like on the golf course?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I was still aggressive. I went at the pins. I didn't think about anything. I asked my caddie what was the situation, I was going to go at the pins, play my golf and yeah, I eventually made a putt on 18 for birdie.
Q. How about back to back chip-in and the hole-out on 8 and 9?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah. I mean that was after, you know, fairly easy bunker shot on 7, skulled it 60 yards over the back. So, you know, looking and making 4, you make 6 and then make two 2s. It was a very strange day. Not very consistent but at least I gave it a good shot.
