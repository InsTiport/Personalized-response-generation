 Q.  An ebb and flow, but in the end, just not quite there for the Internationals?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I thought we played decent golf. Didn't have a great last hole, but just couldn't make any putts. You know, ended up being a little short.   
 Q.  Obviously at the moment, International Team might be square going into the final day but you're still in it obviously and it's better than being behind.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it will be all on the singles tomorrow. Let's hope we can squeeze something still out somewhere in a match, but yeah, for now, it's probably looking like it's going to be a 9-all one going into the final day.   
 Q.  How exciting for the team to be in the mix and be square at least and be fighting for the win?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It's great. We are a great bunch of guys, a good team, a good spirit in the team. We'll go from here and see what we can do.   
 Q.  How excited are the youngsters, because they are the ones that are holding it together.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, they are playing good. The youngsters are playing unbelievable, and it's great seeing the rookies doing really well. You know, it's nice, we're sort of feeding off them.   
 Q.  And how are the experienced guys going?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I think we're playing good. We've done good so far, so I think we're playing some decent golf.
