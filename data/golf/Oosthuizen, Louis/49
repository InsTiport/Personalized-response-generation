LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I know I need just a solid week to get through, but obviously I want to still see if I can get up the FedEx.  And I know if I have a really good week I am right up there.
The game is there, I just need to make a few more putts.  Yeah, I feel good right now.
Q. You've had some success on this course, I think it's three top 12's here including a runner-up.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I felt the greens was a little inconsistent this morning.  But it's running pure.  It's great to putt on, and I just need to get the right lines.
Q. The TOUR Championship, last year you were 31st in the standings, a bit of payback maybe, hopefully you can get there this year?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, last year the worst was sitting watching it.  Everyone that needed not to do good did good on the last.  I remember Sergio's got in the hazard.  And Patrick Cantlay made like a 15-footer.  And Xander had a great finish.  I was like, oh, man, looks like I'm going to be No. 31.  And, yeah, hopefully not this year will it be the case.  Hopefully I can well into the top-30's.
Q. We talked about earlier in the week how you have to balance that conservatism with aggression.  Will you get a little bit aggressive on the weekend if it sets up that way?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: No, I think the way I'm playing the golf course is fine.  Today I could easily have gone 6, 7-under.  So I think just do the same things.  I'm hitting it well.  I'm hitting it well enough to take on a few pins.  I just have to try not to make that odd bogey.  And I need to make a few more putts.
