 Q.   Another tight match down to the wire.   You win it on the 19th hole.   Just discuss the way this match went today.   You were up, he battled back, you survived?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I think both of us only made one bogey early on.   Then just couldn't make birdies.   All of a sudden, Bubba went to three in a row.   I had to fight at the end there to get to extra holes.   Obviously he's got 16, drivable for him.   And 18.   I fought‑‑ I think it was a great match between the two of us.   I'm lucky to win.  
   
 Q.   16, a pivotal hole here.   You were able to drive the green and two putt to win it?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It was probably a little too short for him for a driver.   He was taking a lot off of it, I could see it.   It was the perfect number for me.   A good tee shot, we pitched just on the green.   Yeah, I was lucky that it stayed on the line and didn't go in the left bunker.  
   
 Q.   Finally, Rickie Fowler tomorrow in the round of 16.   Your thoughts on playing Rickie.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It's always going to be tough.   Rickie makes a lot of birdies.   He's a good player.   I need to focus on tomorrow now.
