 Q.   5‑under par 66, really solid opening round.   This first round with the conditions being the way they were, softer greens, good to get a good one in first round?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I think there was a few birdies out there.   But the wind started blowing on the back nine.   You know, under the trees there, once you get it up in the trees, it took the ball all over the place, so it was difficult to get it right.   But yeah, I played nicely and gave myself a lot of birdie opportunities and made a few putts.  
   
 Q.   Usually the wind blows here from one direction.   It's blustery up and down, but was it bouncing a little bit out there, also, or was it just up and down a lot?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   The wind was pretty‑‑ you know, it was getting‑‑ it was all over the place a little bit.   17 I took ages to hit my second shot because I felt it from a few directions.   Yeah, it gets tough, but you've just got to stick with your wind shot and trust it.   
   
 Q.   You hate that when your caddie tells you where the wind is coming from and you swear it's not coming from that direction, huh?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, we're normally pretty good with that.
