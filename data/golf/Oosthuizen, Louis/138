Q.   Your morning match make Snedeker and Mahan, some thoughts about those two guys?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I think any match is a good match.   Obviously the two of them are really good putters and yeah, I think it's going to be, you know, a tough match.   There's not one easy match out there.   Tiger and Kuchar played unbelievable.   We were just talking about that.   We had a good run but yeah, I made two mistakes, 9 and 12, and that cost us.   You can't make any mistakes like that against these guys.

Q.   I know you do this every week with all the rain delays we have on TOUR, but match play, is it different, coming out, you have pressure from the get‑go, and you guys were under the gun‑‑
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Not really.   I think we're so committed as a team, I think we are doing really well together and we knew what we had to do.   Me and Charl knew we had to start birdie 13, 14 and 15.   We had two opportunities on 13 and 14.   Missed them.   But yeah, I mean, it puts a little bit more pressure on but we are used to it.
