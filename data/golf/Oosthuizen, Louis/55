 Q. Red numbers entering the weekend. How do you feel?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Good. Always a good spot going in on a weekend under par at Augusta. If you look at the leaderboard, I think it's going to be pretty bunched up over the weekend and, yeah, it should be very entertaining.   
   
 Q. You managed to turn all yesterday's bogeys into pars. What was the key?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Shooting better than yesterday. I didn't start out great. I struggled on the greens early on, I think I had five 3â€‘putts yesterday, which is something you don't want on your card. I saw my coach a little bit afterwards yesterday on the green and sorted out a few little things and it was a lot better today.   
   
 Q. What did you sort out?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: There's always something to sort out. I need to drive it a little better on the weekend to have a proper go at it.
