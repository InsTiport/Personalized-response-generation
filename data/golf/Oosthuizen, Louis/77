 Q.  What a lovely start, 4 and 3 over Ross Fisher.  Another solid performance by you.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, just fairways and greens.  It's really windy today.  I wanted to give myself a lot of putts.  I'm putting nicely.  I didn't make a lot, but I think I was about 3-under today.  Didn't make bogey.  To me that's always crucial not to give all the way, let the guy fight for a win.   
 Q.  Your boy Branden Grace, you two were awesome at the Presidents Cup, he had a big win as well.  What is the nature of the South African that makes him a gritty match player?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I think it's our sport.  I think we're always sort of the underdogs and have to fight for that win.  It's just the way we're brought up.  Whenever we played any sport, you play as hard as you can to get a win and never give up.   
 Q.  Was there one pivotal hole out there that changed the match in your opinion?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I think the tee shot I had on 11 to go to 3-up.  And then other that than that, the 8th hole I made a nice birdie putt to go 2-up.  I was just solid.  So I didn't make any mistakes and that's one of key things that I always try and do.
