   LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I played well, but scoring was not great. So a bit disappointed. Should at least be 7- , 8-under, so it just makes things a bit more tough for tomorrow.   
 I hit a few good putts that didn't go in, so that's always disappointing when that happens. It's just part of the game?  
  
  Q. I take it you've looked at that leaderboard. You're not that far off.   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I mean, five shots leaving a lot of work for tomorrow. It could have been two or three. The guys are still playing 16, 17, 18 and there's definitely birdies out there.   
 So I'll be probably six behind going into the last round. So you know, got to start well tomorrow.   
  
  Q. I guess the positive is if you're nailing those approaches and the putts are not that far off, could all just kick into place.   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, might not be this week, but might be soon.   
  
  Q. A place you like though, this, isn't it. You've played well here before.   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I think the weather was a bit more like what we expected, and not the weather we had the first two rounds.  
  
  Q. On that front, you have weathered the storm; those winds were fierce in the first, benign more on the second and almost calm today?  
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I think it's a type of golf if you play in a bit of wind, but the first round was too much.   
  
  Q. What do we have to do to make you smile and accept that you've got a good chance? A couple of hours?  
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I'll always smile, don't worry about it (smiling).
