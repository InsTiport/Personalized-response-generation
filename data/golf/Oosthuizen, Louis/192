 Q.   Conditions according to some of the players, not too conducive.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I think it was low scoring out there.   I can see why Branden is playing well.   Today I hit a few bad shots, but just the putter went completely cold.   I just couldn't read a putt today.   I hit every putt exactly where I wanted to, hit good putts, just didn't make any.   So, yeah, really disappointed.   Should have easily got to 9.   
   
 Q.   Still two days left in the competition and you're a natural fighter; still give yourself a chance?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, there's a lot of golf left.   You want to try and get yourself within three or four before Sunday.   And then around this course, anything can happen.   To play well, you can shoot low, and if you're not hitting well, you can easily shoot over par.   
   
 Q.   The leaderboard has changed up today, so quite possible that it can happen again tomorrow.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I think the weather on the weekend, it's expected to rain a bit.   So this course is going to play completely different if it rains.   It's going to be very long.   But it will soften up the greens a little bit more.   
You know, I think if the greens become a little bit faster and quicker, then the scoring will definitely not be that low.   But it's nice to play the golf course this way to be able to make a few birdies.
