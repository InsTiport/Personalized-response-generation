Q. Great effort on this final day.  How did you view it from your perspective?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I mean, I didn't really make any putts the whole round.  The only putt I made was on the last hole.  A two loose shots on 10 and 11 probably cost me one, maybe two shots.
I gave it everything I had coming in.  I left myself with an impossible first putt on 16 and could have done better than that, but 3-putted.  And then difficult hitting it close on 17, trying to make birdie.  Hit one good putt on 18.
Q. Did the arm give you any trouble at all today?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: No, it did.  It was tight this morning and we worked that all and it was fine.  No worries.
