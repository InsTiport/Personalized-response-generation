Q. What a great week for you.  How tough is it to go against Jason Day?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: You need to play well.  I said that before, you need to play well.  I played okay, but nothing spectacular.  Up against a guy like Jason, you need to be in good form.
Q. What positives do you take away from the week?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: You know, the game is shaping up really nicely the last two weeks.  So I think that everyone's focused right now.  I'm playing Houston, so take a few days off and be in Houston and then Augusta.  So I'm feeling comfortable about the game.
Q. When you have a week like this and you say you're playing well and it's match play, can that translate over to stroke play and how so?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yes, I mean, I hit the ball well.  I hit the shots that I wanted to.  I think if you're playing well, it doesn't matter what you're playing, match play or stroke play.  But there's certainly a lot of positives about this week.
Q. You told me that it was a lot to play all these matches.  Was that an issue?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: No, it didn't affect my game at all.  I just tried to loosen everything up the whole time.  It didn't affect anything.  I just couldn't make a putt, didn't make the shots, didn't make the birdies.  I think I made one, which is not close to enough birdies out there.
It's tough to play Jason.  You know he's going to make a lot of birdies.  I just needed to play a lot better to have a chance.
Q. You collected an awful lot of FedExCup points.  I know this is disappointing, but you had a wonderful week of golf here.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yes, I'll take a lot out of this week.  I finished quarterfinals a few times and missed out, so now to get to the finals, it's better.
