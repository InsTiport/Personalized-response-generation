 Q.  Louis, 4-under today, a bogey-free 4-under.  Tell us about your round and how the conditions were.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah.  Definitely nice scoring conditions out there.  I don't know.  Just yesterday the horrible start, short-sided myself so many times and that was the main thing today, not to do that and so, you know, I did a good job with that, rolling a few nice putts and just, you know, played solid.   
 Q.  Last week's tie for 2nd.  Did that help propel you in this week and the rest of your season, really?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I've been playing well for awhile now.  Just can't put four rounds together.  And last week, even though I didn't have a great weekend, it was sort of a tournament that I just got myself around and did four rounds and, you know, feel like I can have another good round tomorrow and hold on from there.   
 Q.  Yes, your weekend is certainly off to a good start here at the Byron Nelson.  Thank you and good luck tomorrow.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Thank you very much.
