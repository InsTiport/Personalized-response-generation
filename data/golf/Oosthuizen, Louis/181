  LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It's close.   It's close to the jacket.   But I mean, Bubba played well.   It was great.   It was an unbelievable atmosphere out there.   You know, we were going at it both, so it was good.   I had an opportunity probably on 10 to hit a better tee shot, but he hit an unbelievable shot.   So hats off to him.   He did well.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, when something like that happens early in the round, you've got to keep your emotions in place because you think, this is it, this is going to happen.   I mean, something like that, that was my first double eagle ever, and to do it in a spot like Augusta, that's special.   So yeah, it was tough.   
I felt it was tough over the next four or five holes, but then when we turned I felt very relaxed.   I made a few great saves.   I probably did very well to get in the playoff, and you know, I couldn't hit two more better putts on 18 and 10 in a playoff.   I felt like I hit great putts.  
   
 Q.   When you saw where his ball went off the tee on the second playoff hole, take us through the process of what you saw.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, for me it's an easy tee shot.   It's 3‑wood, I turn a 3‑wood over quite easy, and I just caught it a little bit off the heel and it went to the right.   I wanted to get it down there to have a little bit flatter lie, and hit a great second shot, the ball didn't go anywhere.   I had exactly the same distance as I had on 10 in regulation round, and hit the same club.   I just wanted to pitch it somewhere five, six yards onto the green, and the ball just didn't go anywhere.   So yeah, it's just one of those.
