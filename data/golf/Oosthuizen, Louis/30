Q. (Regarding NBA draft.)  Did you catch any of that?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: No.  I watched a little bit, but obviously not that part.  I heard this morning from everyone, and so, yeah, it was quite funny to hear that my name was on the...
Q. See any parallels between yourself and Darius (indiscernible)?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I don't think I should be getting into speaking a lot about NBA.  I just love watching it.  I don't know all the bits and pieces about it.
Q. What is your energy level just compared to what you went through last week, just flying cross country, two rounds.  Where are you right now?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I'm good.  I mean, that was probably as awful weather that I've played in in a while.  It reminded me of being back in Europe in '06 and '07.  That was the weather we played in a lot of weeks.
So, yeah, no, energy feels fine.  Played nicely and looking for to the weekend.
Q. Are you comfortable in that weather?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I don't think anyone is comfortable in that weather.  Yeah, you know it's not -- you still have to play.  It's not going to be called off.  You just had to toughen out.  I mean, the golf course we're playing is so long to what you're used to playing.
Q. Even if the sun comes out it's still probably going to be soft and muddy over the weekend.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah.  I mean, it was just -- with the rain coming down and the wind it was just not going anywhere.  If it's just wet you can still hit a bit of distance on it in the air.  Today was just, yeah, it was playing low.
Q. What went well?  Anything?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I played good.  I played solid.  Eight fairways and greens and made some good putts, so I just played solid.  Feel like I'm swinging it pretty decent.  Just have to give yourself some opportunities on the weekend.
