 Q.   2‑down through 11, that was a good match to win, wasn't it?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah.   Just couldn't really get going, couldn't make putts for birdies, and then had a good run from 12 to 15, taking four in a row.   I had a little putt on 16 to win.   But yeah, all in all, very happy.   A bit shaky start, but I felt like I kept it together at the end.  
   
 Q.   Is it true you've never seen snow until yesterday?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It's true.   Well, I've seen snow on television.   No, that's the first time I've properly seen snow.   
   
 Q.   What did you think?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It was‑‑ well, it was probably what you imagine it would look like.   But it was really good fun to‑‑ especially at the hotel, it was a beautiful setting last night.  
   
 Q.   Is the issue here the cold?   I was talking to Chubby, and he was saying these guys are not used to playing in this sort of weather.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It was cold.   It got chilly again when we walked down 11, it was really cold.   Yeah, it's completely different to Monday.   Almost you could have played in shorts if you wanted to.   Yeah, it's completely different to what everyone expected.  
   
 Q.   Robert Garrigus tomorrow; do you know much about him?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I know he hits it a long way and he makes a lot of birdies, so I need to get my game together to make a few birdies tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   How do you adjust in weather like this?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Just try and keep warm.   Luckily it's match play, so you play the man.   I think stroke play would have been completely different.  
   
 Q.   What was the key out there for you?   Were you able to get on a run?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, just‑‑ I struggled with the speed on the greens.   They were still really slick, and just left myself with loads of five‑footers, four‑footers to halve holes.   But all in all, the last seven holes I played really nicely.  
   
 Q.   Everybody has a philosophy in match play.   What is yours?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Just go out and try and beat the guy on the day.
