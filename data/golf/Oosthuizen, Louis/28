 Q.  The hole-in-one, tell us about the club, yardage and reaction from your fellow players, because they enjoyed it, as well, didn't they?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I hit it a little thinner than I wanted to but it actually worked out perfect because it had some nice roll on the ball. As it pitched, Poults were calling it the whole time. I saw it go away but I wasn't sure if it wasn't in because I didn't hear any reaction from the people up there. Then obviously a few guys started applausing and Poults, and yeah, enjoyed it.   
It was a good line, and I mean, I knew it was fine. It was going to be decent, but I obviously didn't know it was going to do that.   
 Q.  Tell us about the rest of it, you finished 4-under, 68. Happy with where you are?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I mean, still a lot of rust sort of in the swing. I took a long time off. Last week, last two rounds hit it horrible. I just worked a bit on Tuesday and worked a few things out yesterday, and still need to keep plotting along to get it perfect.   
 Q.  So I look out there and it was absolute perfect, no wind, and a beautiful day to play golf, but it's still a test, and if there's wind, it's really going to get quite difficult, so today was a good day to get a score?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Definitely. The greens are probably as good as I've ever seen them. They are very quick. They are firm. You need to leave yourself on the right side of the hole, and it's great to putt on these greens, and it makes the second shots a little tougher to just work it all out. But today, the weather was actually perfect.   
 Q.  How many holes-in-one is that? Do you know how many?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: No idea. I think the last one was in 2016 at The Open I think. I don't know, I think as a professional, probably fifth one I think.
