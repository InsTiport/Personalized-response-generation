Q. Louis, what a strong finish.  That 18th hole has given up a lot of birdies today, and you stuck it in there from 100 yards.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I normally hit 4-wood off that tee, and today sort of felt a little bit better with the driver.  Got in really close.
I remember a few years back -- I'm not sure when it was -- actually I'll get second shot, sort of similar feelings standing over it.  Pitch it long right, let it spin down.
Yeah, I had a good shot and good day.
Q. You had 10 fairways, 13 greens, and 4 or 5 scramblers.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, you know, still a little upset I missed an 8-footer for par on 6; just misread it.
You know, I'm hitting a lot of irons and 4-woods off the tee, so don't really go to the driver all the time.  I think this golf course allows you to do that.
But, you know, still a few swings I'm working on, and need to get everything sorted before U.S. Open.
Q. Seeing a lot of low scores today.  The greens apparently are still receptive.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, they're a little quicker than they were yesterday.  But, yeah, you get a lot spin so you can attack them.  They're pure.
