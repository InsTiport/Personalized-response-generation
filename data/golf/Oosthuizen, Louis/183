Q.   What allowed you to find some success at this course? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Just played nicely today, you know.   I made a good score, swung the club really well.   It was just nice ‑‑ it was just nice having a good round.

Q.   What do you feel like you need to do tomorrow?   People play this course differently on Sunday.   What do you think needs to be happen? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   You have got to take it shot for shot.   (Inaudible) you know it's going to make a few birdies.   So I'll probably do the same as today, just pick my holes where I feel like I can take the pin on and race and try and make pars.

Q.   Did you feel like you were grinding a little bit today?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Not really.   I felt like I hit it really well.   I felt I was probably ‑‑ left quite a few birdies out there the way I was hitting it.   I'm happy to be 2 behind going into Sunday.   (Inaudible).

Q.   What do you think (inaudible) in terms of atmosphere, pressure, that kind of thing? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It was great today.   I mean, you could hear the roars all over the place.   So it was really nice to be out there and I think it's going to be the same tomorrow. 

Q.   Thoughts going into Sunday? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Well, you know, it's always ‑‑ it's what we play for is to have a chance at winning a major going into Sunday.   I put myself in a position for this week and we'll just be fun to go out there and try to play the best I can.

Q.   Will you sleep well tonight? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, sure.   I'm glad to get to bed.
