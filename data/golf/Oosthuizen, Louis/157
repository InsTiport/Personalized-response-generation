  LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I had felt really uncomfortable out on the course, but today, I had been working on some good things on the range and got it better, and I knew if I could put a score up there or just get close to Scott, I had a good chance.  
   
 Q.   A five‑shot deficit, going into the final round, did you have a number in mind or just to play as best as you possibly could?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   At first I tried just to make as many birdies‑‑ I felt if I get it to 18‑under, I had a good shot.   You know, I made bogey and I saw Scott made bogey as well and at the end made two good pars on 17, 18.   
Got off it a great start and can only go on from here.   
   
 Q.   Up to No. 4 in the World Rankings now, the crowd was pretty vocal in terms of supporting you, what was it like playing in front of the home fans?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It was great.   Starting out behind, you don't have that much pressure and wanted to see if I could make loads of birdies to start with.   When I got to the 9th I was one behind and then the crowd really got into it.   By the time I got to 12, I was leading by one and it was great to see them so pumped up.
