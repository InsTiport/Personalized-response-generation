Q. How are you looking forward to playing back in your home country here at the Nedbank Challenge this week?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it's always fun being back here, especially a special place like this.  This is a tournament we grew up watching and want to play in it and eventually one day want to win it.
Yeah, looking forward to just playing back in SA again.
Q. This is your first Rolex Series event, as well.  How pleasing for you as a South African that that tournament has been included in the Rolex Series which is now quite prestigious on The European Tour?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it's very special.  For the guys to come here and support our country with this tournament is great.  The Rolex Series has been amazing for Europe.  I think there's a lot of points this week for the guys to get and try to make up and see if they can catch Tommy.
Q. How do you feel your form is coming into this week?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I'm pretty well rested.  I had some good break after Presidents Cup.  Took quite a bit of time off.  Played a bit of golf the last two weeks.  I'm ready to go.
