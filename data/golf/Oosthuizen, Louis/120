 Q.   Louis, good playing out there.   4-under par 68 in the second round.   Talk about your game.  
LOUIS OOSTHULZEN:   It was just a good, solid round.   Still made a few errors out there but, you know, 7-under going into the weekend feel like that's good.   Lot of birdies out there.   The greens are really soft and you can attack the pin so you can see what the scoring is going to be like.  
   
 Q.   What part of your game is really working for you?  
LOUIS OOSTHULZEN:   I'm hitting everything good.   I'm driving well, hitting my irons good.   Could have holed a few more putts in the two days.   I made some putts as well.  
   
 Q.   What are you looking for on the weekend?  
LOUIS OOSTHULZEN:   Birdies.   Just got to eliminate mistakes.   I think I've had 6 bogies already.   I need to try and get them off for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised Morgan Hoffmann is out there 13-under par?  
LOUIS OOSTHULZEN:   I don't know him very well so I can definitely see that score out there.   Like I say, there's a lot of birdies out there.
