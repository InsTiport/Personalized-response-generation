 Q.   Just a tough day really, wasn't it.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It was very frustrating.   I mean, we played terrible, both of us.   So I think more to it, I think we just started out badly and then just couldn't get on a run and it just went on and snowballed.   
We tried but it was just not there.   We still felt that we were swinging it well and playing well.   Today was just‑‑ we couldn't get in a rhythm of two or three holes where we hit good shots.   If Charl had a bad one, the next hole I had a bad one.   We couldn't get in a rhythm and too many bogeys.
