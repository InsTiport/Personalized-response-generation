 Q.   I talked to your caddie and he said you've been on the edges of the greens all week.   Obviously today you saw some fall in.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I mean, I started out front nine, putted horribly again.   I felt like I hit the ball really well every day, but just made‑‑ well, I hit a few really close on the back nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, and then 14 made one long putt.   But yeah, I mean, I felt like I hit it pretty much the same as I did yesterday and the day before.   Yesterday two holes cost me‑‑ I three‑putted 16 and 17 and then I made that horrible 8 on 18.   I'm struggling to find consistency in the putter.   I'm either making them or putting horribly, which is pretty frustrating.  
   
 Q.   You've hit it pretty well for this stretch, though?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, two weeks ago when I played in Korea I really hit it well, and I came here this week with a lot of confidence in ball‑striking and felt like I'm hitting it really good, giving myself loads of opportunities.   But yeah, I mean, you need to make putts around here, and the greens aren't easy.   But I felt the first two rounds the course was still playing‑‑ you could make loads of birdies.  
   
 Q.   You're playing two in Texas, right, the next two in Texas?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I'm playing the next three, depending on when the baby comes.   But yeah, that's the plan, playing up to Memorial.  
   
 Q.   Memorial is on the schedule?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   So far.  
   
 Q.   Presidents Cup definitely?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, definitely want to play Memorial, but if the little one comes earlier, then I won't.  
   
 Q.   The putt on 15, what did you hit in there?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I think that was a big putt to‑‑ knowing it's a par‑5 coming up.   The way I was hitting it, I was hitting it pretty close, giving myself a lot of opportunities.   With a par‑5, 16 and 17 with a good swing, you're going to give yourself a 10‑, 15‑footer for birdie.  
   
 Q.   Are you aware that the record for this tournament is 6‑under?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   No, I had no idea.  
   
 Q.   You do now?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I do now, and now that putt is in my head, yeah.  
   
 Q.   You made seven in a row at one of the playoff events last year?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I did, in Boston, third round.
