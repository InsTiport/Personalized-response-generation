LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Started playing really well from 12.  Started hitting the ball nicely.  And made a nice long birdie putt on 14 to go one ahead.  And unfortunately there's got to be a loser.
Q. You travel around with a mattress because of lower back issues.  Tell us a bit about that story.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: You know, now it's just to have the same bed every week.  I have a bit of history with lower back.  So, yeah, I thought why not?  We have a car that travels with all the golf clubs, and it's just traveling with my mattress.
Q. Who do you have in your match tomorrow?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I don't know, I think Bernd Wiesberger.
Q. You obviously know him pretty well?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I just saw the scores, I don't know if Andy is playing really well or if Bernd is leading, but tomorrow he could be playing well.  I think it's all set up for going out in match play, you've got to know your opponent and play well and you've just got to try to play better.
Q. Not as windy as yesterday, but certainly it's a tough golf?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it's a slightly different direction.  And the front nine it was to me all over the place.  I started midway through the front nine started hitting really low shots just to take out the wind completely.  Obviously when you get down to the 12th, you can see easily where the wind is.
Q. Like playing a different golf course, to mix it up a little bit?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I yeah, I love it when we get down to the 12th.  It's got that links feeling, and strong winds down there, so I like that stretch.
