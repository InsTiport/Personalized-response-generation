Q. Yet another close match, but yet another victory as well.  The playoffs started for you today.  How were you able to get this win?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It was definitely at that proper match play feeling if you lose, you are going home.  I played really solid.  Didn't make a lot of birdies.  I had a lot of putts shave the edges.  But I gave myself really good opportunities and I put pressure the whole time on Andy coming in.  It was just in my favor today.
Q. You have another opportunity tomorrow to take down, the No. 1 player in the world in Jordan Spieth.  What are you expecting from him?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I need to play a little better than I did today.  I need to make those birdie putts.  He's probably the best putter out there.  I can expect him to make quite a few putts for birdie or save pars, whatever it might be.  It will be nice.  It's going to be tough with the crowd.  I know they are going to be on his side.  But hopefully I've got a few fans out there.
Q. Did you change your approach in playing someone as talented as him?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: No.  I will stick to what I've been doing around this golf course.  I'm playing the guy.  If he makes a mistake, you are going to play the hole a little different probably.  It's going to be a big task, but I feel like I'm up to it.
