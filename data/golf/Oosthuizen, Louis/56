 Q.  Your second shot, what were you thinking after you saw that lie?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I thought it was perfect off the tee and I picked up the tee.  I saw it bounce and I didn't expect it -- I don't know what I was looking at, I was looking at my ball down there.  Obviously it must have just not been as good as I thought it was.  But it was a scrappy lie.  I was just sort of trying to hit the front edge.   
 Q.  Tomorrow morning you'll play Ian, he's got Ryder Cup experience, you have a ton of Presidents Cup experience and success.  What do you think the match will be like?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It will be tough.  It's definitely going to be tough.  I'm looking forward to it.  Anyone on a good day can take it all.   
 Q.  Talk about your match with Jason Day, you had to come from behind.  You had a lot of momentum coming in, the way you finished it off.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Definitely playing 12 I hit the worst wedge of my life.  I lost 12, lost 13.   
 Q.  Thoughts on playing Ian Poulter, you're both great match play competitors.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it should be good fun.  He's obviously got a good track record and he's playing well.
