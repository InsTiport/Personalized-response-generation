  Q.  Nice round.   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  Yeah, I don't think we're going to see the weather like this again.   
  
  Q.  Certainly wasn't what we were expecting yesterday was it?   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  Definitely not.  But it was good.  After seeing the weather, I knew that I had to make something close to level par because it's really tough out there.  I was hitting very well, hitting my driver well, 3-wood well and putting nicely.   
  
  Q.  We've been hearing a lot about how tough it is out there with the rough and that sort of stuff, how was it in your opinion?   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  It's unbelievable, really, the rough.  Whenever you're in the rough, you just grab a 9-iron and hit some shots with a sand wedge.  Yeah, it was really difficult.  I think the key is -- and it's quite long some of the holes so the key is to get it off the tee quite well and then it worked for me today, yeah.   
  
  Q.  You're having a good year so far, success down in South Africa.   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  Yeah, I feel like I'm playing good and just confidence, it's much better than the previous two years.    
  
  Q.  Free of injuries at the moment?   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  Is that what's held your back over the last couple of years?   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  Yeah, just normal stiffness in lower back but not any pain or anything. I haven't felt anything in my neck for about six months.   
  
  Q.  Looking forward to the next three days no doubt.   
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  Yeah, it's tough out there.   
 I just have to -- whether the weather stays like this, probably have some rain over the weekend or something, so I don't really see low scores.  I was quite surprised with a couple or 4-under being the leaders after 3 or 2.  But it's good, yes.
