 Q.   Could you just talk about your round a little bit today?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it was not the best, struggled on the greens, and at the end I didn't hit the ball very well.   So, yeah, I don't think we're going to get much easier conditions.   So disappointed.   Was trying to get it back to level par, at least, but just my bogey on 17.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it's‑‑ I mean the ball definitely didn't go that far in the afternoon, especially the last nine holes.   But still, I mean, there wasn't much breeze.   You can attack.   The greens stop.   All in all, I'm a bit disappointed.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Just‑‑ I'm just trying to get all the pieces together.   But a few things that I'm not happy about.   Short irons not the best at the moment.   And just I didn't see the lines on the greens today.   And I had a lot of putts, way too many.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   No, the greens were running good.   The greens were running very good, I just couldn't put the pace and line together.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it's‑‑ I need a good round tomorrow to get back in the tournament.   I think if you look at the scores this morning, hopefully the weather is the same tomorrow morning, but yeah, I need a good round to get back in it, sure.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   No, you knew the weather was good.   And I think we all got very lucky in the afternoon the wind didn't go really bad on us.   But looking at the scores, it was definitely good advantage playing in the morning.   But you get that in links golf and Open golf.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Pretty good, I think.   I had one or two bad tee shots which cost me bogeys.   But the rest I did really good.   But from there I just didn't put the ball close enough.
