Q.   What were you thinking on 18? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I mean, I was playing for‑‑ after 16 I was going for second spot.   You never want to see something like that happen.   Jim played beautiful all day.   You know, it was close.   That first chip, he hits it a bit further and it would have been four feet from the hole.   Keegan played really well all day.   He made loads of putts.   He made another one on 18, so yeah, it was fantastic.   To shoot 64 in the final round is great golf.

Q.   The last couple weeks it seems like you're never out of this thing. 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I've been swinging it well the whole day.   I started swinging it well probably on 17 on there.   I hit a good drive, a good second shot, a good putt.   I just couldn't get the speed right the whole week or the whole day, and then on 18 a good second and just got the line a bit wrong.   Good speed, just got the line wrong.   So frustrating for me.
But I felt I played really well.   I'm going to take a lot out of this, and I feel ready for next week. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, definitely.   The goal this week was to have a good week and get it right next week.   You know, what happened on 18 with Jim was sad.   He played so beautiful all day and things like that.   But on the other hand, Keegan did nothing wrong.   He played well, as well, and that's the game.
