LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: No, no, no.  I don't really know a lot about him.  I know that Owen caddies for him.  I've obviously seen the way he's playing.  We've got a lot of South Africans playing this week, and it's great seeing the names up there.  Yeah, hopefully, you know, he can keep going for two more rounds.
Q. I was going to say, what do you think is behind this with the South Africans?  Is it the links golf?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I don't know.  It's something about South Africans liking links golf.  It's a strange thing because there's not a lot of links golf out in SA.  Like I said, I don't really know that much about him, but he's a great guy, and hopefully, you know, he keeps on playing well.
Q. Your round, how are you playing?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I don't make too many mistakes, really.  Stupid bogeys here and there.  Just need to take that off the scorecard.  We were very lucky with, obviously, the weather this afternoon.  It was perfect conditions to shoot 4, 5-under, and didn't really take advantage of it.  So just a little bit more work on the weekend for me.
Q. Just your thoughts on tomorrow and how you feel going into the weekend.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, six shots behind with 36 to go in a major is a great spot to be.  Need a good solid round tomorrow and see if -- see if I can get up the leaderboard a bit.
Q. Would you like to hold the Claret Jug?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Always.  Love a Claret Jug in my hands.  Only have the replica now at my place, but the original would be nice.
