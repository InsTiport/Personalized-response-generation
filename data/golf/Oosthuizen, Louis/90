Q. Louis, this is the first time you've advanced to the semifinals in this event, how did you get yourself to that point?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I was down most of the day and then started playing nicely.  And I think he gave me a bit of a chance on 12.  I was in the water and he followed me in there.  So that was a bit of a save for me.
So I just played nicely and tried to give myself as many birdie opportunities, so I'm putting well, so just try to do it tomorrow.
Q. You're such a calm demeanor on the outside, what's going on on the inside when you're trying to close out a match?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: You get fired up, but I'm just trying to stay within myself and not really show anything.  So sometimes it's difficult.  But I felt like I've done pretty good today.
Q. The audience is going to take a look at the putt you made on the 17th green.  What did you see when you stood over the ball there?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It was one of those where I was going to lag it close or if I hit a bad speed I could make it.  I felt really comfortable with the line.  And sometimes without really thinking too much you just work yourself and get that stroke.  I don't know what to do when I get to 18.
Q. We talked in the morning after your match in the Sweet 16 that you were the underdog versus Jordan Spieth.  Tomorrow morning you're going out with Rafa Cabrera Bello, we all know in the golf world how good a player he is, but most people would not look at you as the favorite in this match.  How does that switch gears for you?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Not really.  That changes nothing to the way I want to play.  I know Rafa is a great player, makes a lot of birdies.  I need to play really well to get into the finals.
