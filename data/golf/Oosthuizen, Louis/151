Q.   That was a great start, talk us through the day?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, good start.   Hitting it really well.   I made nice putts, hit it fairly close the front nine, and probably made one or two long‑ish birdie putts.   But teed off 10 and the wind came in, with the weather coming in, and I probably just missed two shots and put myself in really tough spots to get up‑and‑down and then made bogey. 
But feeling good, spinning it well.   So haven't hit it that well in a while like I did on the front nine. 

Q.   Did you find something yesterday? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, we stood on the range‑‑ well, out on the course, actually, and just found little things that I tried today and went out on the range this morning and seemed to strike it really nice.   Went on the course and I hit it beautifully.

Q.   Quick thoughts on the course, as well, tricky?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, if the weather was like it was this morning, the front nine for us, there's a lot of birdies out there, because if you hit it well off the tee, you don't have that long of clubs into the greens, even though the greens are really tough. 
But yeah, I think there's a lot of birdies out there.   But you know, when that weather came in, and if it's going to rain or really windy, it's tough off the tees.   If you miss the fairways, you're going to struggle. 
Felt really good today.   I mean, I'm very looking forward to the next three days, and hopefully we can keep it going.
