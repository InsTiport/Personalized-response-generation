  LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, nothing spectacular.   Just didn't finish very well.   Didn't give myself good birdie opportunities.   The last hole was a bit disappointing, hitting two good shots to get it there, and then taking three putts. 
But other than that, still in a good position for tomorrow. 

Q.   With that rivalry with your playing partner, slow‑ish start and then got it back together? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, Charl is hitting is great, which is nice to see.   He struggled a lot with injuries this year, and so one of these days, he's going to make those putts and he's going to shoot lights‑out.

Q.   Are you feeling the same? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Today I didn't do anything spectacular but I gave myself opportunities for birdies, and I just need to make a few tomorrow.   You know, there's nothing more that you can do.   I think if I shoot a 6‑under tomorrow, maybe I'm probably giving it the best I can.

Q.   And the evidence of three days so far, you know it's out there and you know you're capable of it. 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, the scoring is out there.   I think it's a course where you can give yourself loads of birdie opportunities, but the greens are running really quick and you've got to see the grain on them and you've got to make the putts.
