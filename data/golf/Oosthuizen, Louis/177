 Q.   Better round today?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it was quite a bit better.   I hit the ball decent, but still not making any putts.   I made one long one and then missed loads of 20‑footers again.   So I'm just a bit frustrated that I could have made quite a bit more.  
   
 Q.   The wind was switched around from yesterday?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, the front‑‑ first three holes were so tough this morning.   Where yesterday it was playing down to the right.   But I think we got lucky.   It doesn't look very good out there.   I think there might be a bit of rain coming in.   What was difficult today is once you're in the bunker you're probably in a puddle of water, so you tried to stay out of it completely because even around the greens you couldn't really do much out of it.  
   
 Q.   The weather is intended to be better tomorrow.   Does that give you a bit of confidence?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it would be nice if the wind picks up a bit.   If the rain can stay away and the wind can pick up, I think it will be nice.   It will be a good test.   
   
 Q.   Did you have trouble choosing clubs today?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   No, not really.   The ball didn't go that far because‑‑ but to us‑‑ to me it yesterday it didn't go that far.   I was pretty fine with clubbing it.   It was just the greens.   I just struggled on the greens.
