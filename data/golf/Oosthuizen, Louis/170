  DOUG MILNE:   Louis, quite the successful round 3 here at the Deutsche Bank Championship, 8‑under 63, quite the impressive front nine, 29 with a birdie to make it seven in a row, I believe.   Just some comments on the round, and then we'll take questions.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, obviously probably the start anyone would dream of on that front nine.   I made everything, so you get those days where you just look at a putt and you hole it.   That was my first nine holes.   
You know, still played well on the back nine, put myself in good spots to make birdies, and just couldn't make any.   Couldn't make any putts.   
And then with the one bogey on 17, the first green I missed, so a bit disappointed at the trap shot I hit there.   But nice birdie on 18.   
   
 Q.   In your mind what was the greater accomplishment, the double eagle at 2 at Augusta or those seven birdies in a row?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I'd still take the double eagle (smiling).   
   
 Q.   What was going through your mind when you were on that roll with the seven birdies in a row?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I think at that stage, nothing.   You just keep on going.   I went at most of the pins.   Once I started getting birdies, making putts, I started going at the pins because my swing felt great, and after 10 holes being 8‑under, you always think about getting it to 59.   I didn't do anything different from there on in.   I hit great shots on 11, 12, 13, 14, so I gave myself good chances to post that number.   But I think it would have been really tough playing tomorrow shooting in the 50s today.   So I'm very happy with my 8‑under today.   
   
 Q.   Actually you hit a great shot into 3, and you actually had a chance there, as well.   What happened on that putt there?   You looked at that one and it didn't go in.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it was one of those where you just need to put a bit of speed on it, otherwise it's a funny little breaker that was just out the left edge, and I did put speed on it, just on the complete wrong line.   I pushed it a little bit, and just a bad putt I hit.   
And then I made actually a good four‑footer, return four‑footer for par, but just a misread and everything.   Still early in the round.  
   
 Q.   You talked about this outside, but late in the round you looked like you were kind of grabbing your shoulder or chest area.   What happened there?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I don't know.   On 16 I had to hit a big 9‑iron.   I probably went at it a bit too hard, a bit steep on the ball, in the ground, and just felt a little pinch in one of the muscles.   I felt it on 17 still on the 5‑wood off the tee and the second shot, so you know, that stage you're thinking about all kinds of things, what's wrong.   But on 18 I just‑‑ from 18 on I didn't feel anything, so it probably just‑‑ I don't know, a little something, but nothing major.   
   
 Q.   Do I understand you correctly that you're glad that you didn't shoot 59 today?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I won't say that.   You know, I think it was a great opportunity to put myself in a big lead going into tomorrow.   That changes everything.   But you know, Rory, I knew he was always going to come back on the back nine.   I knew he was always going to push it, and he hit a lot of shots really close and made good birdies.   
You know, it's three shots tomorrow.   I think it'll be a good day.  
   
 Q.   As strange as this sounds because of the start you got off to, are you at all disappointed sitting here because you could have shot a really low number or you had a six‑shot lead at one point and now it's less than that?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, the lead, obviously it's not‑‑ I didn't give a lot of shots away.   Rory just kept on coming at me, and I knew that.   I knew I needed to make birdies to keep a five or six‑shot lead.   So a bit disappointed in that I had a lot of opportunities on the back nine still for birdies, and I only made two with a bogey on 17.   
You know, all in all, started the day one behind going into tomorrow, leading by three, I'm very happy.   It's a bit strange saying that Sunday afternoon because you think you'd be holding the trophy right here now.   
   
 Q.   Was that feeling you had in your right shoulder, was that something you've had before in a tournament?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I think a few times, both sides.   It's probably just a little muscle.   I don't know.   It's nothing big.  
   
 Q.   It's something that's worked itself out, though?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, as I'm sitting here I don't feel it at all.   I mostly feel it when I'm going through the ball.   I'm not much worried about it.   
   
 Q.   When you look at that birdie run, when is the last time you felt that in control of all parts of your game?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I don't even know before today how many was my run before that, how many in a row.   Like I said, after making the putt on 8, I felt like I can't miss anything.   And then on 9, it was one of those, you just needed to get it high enough out, and then it's all about the speed, and I got it perfect again.   And 10 I hit it to a foot.   
You know, standing on the putt on 11, I thought I had a perfect line again.   The last thing I thought was missing it.   I wanted to make it.   
You know, you've got so much confidence if you start making big putts because you know you just need to hit the greens and you've got yourself a good opportunity for the birdies.   My iron play has been really good.   
   
 Q.   You've never played in this tournament before this year.   What did you know about the golf course before you got here, and what has allowed it to be so much to your liking?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, first time here.   I just heard a lot of things, everyone was saying there's a lot of birdies on the golf course, and if you're playing well, you can shoot really low numbers.   You know, it's a good course.   
I think if you play well, you can shoot really low numbers around here, but still, you need to put yourself in good spots off the tee.   You need to come from the fairways into the greens, and I've just been hitting the ball really well.   You know, it's all about making the putts, and I did the front nine.   
   
 Q.   You've never won in the States despite the Open Championship victory.   How important is it to you to kind of check that off your resumÃ©?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it's always nice to get it done.   I've put myself in great spots this year, had a good chance at Houston, had a good chance at Augusta, a few other tournaments, WGC earlier.   I'm just going to keep on doing what I'm doing.   The more I'm in the position on the back nine on Sunday, or in this case on a Monday, then it's going to happen sooner or later.   I'm just going to keep on plodding on.   
DOUG MILNE:   Louis, congratulations on a great day, and keep it up tomorrow.
