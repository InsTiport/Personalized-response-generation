 Q. Looking at the leaderboard, such a diverse group from around the globe, does it speak to the depth of golf? In America we probably get focused on two or three players, but a lot of players can put up numbers like Jeev did today and yourself. 
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I think The European Tour now, with The Race to Dubai and everything, the guys are really starting to work harder, actually, because knowing that everyone wants to do well to play in The Race to Dubai. 
 So I mean, someone like Rory, coming through like that, it's unbelievable, but there's a lot of guys, like Alvaro Quiros, Martin Kaymer and all of those guys coming through. They are really good players. 
 It's nice to see everyone here.
