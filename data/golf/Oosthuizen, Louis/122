Q.   What are your thoughts on the third day?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it's been typical golf.   Hit it well for two days, didn't make a putt.   Hit it horrible today, made putts, scored my best score today.   So a bit all over the place today, but you know, if I can find a few more fairways and greens tomorrow and make a few putts to try and put some low number out there.

Q.   I appreciate the leaders are in advance but you're in a good position otherwise to push on. 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I'm too far back to really do anything tomorrow to scare them or something.   But a good round tomorrow would take a lot out of that for next week. 

Q.   Can you see that low round?   Are you playing well enough at times? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I think if I hit it like yesterday and putted like today I shoot 65 or something.
