 Q.  Talk about your match today.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: You know what, we both actually deserved probably a halve.  We both didn't play really well.  We struggled the whole way around.  I played a little better the last four holes.  We both actually the last four played a lot better.  He hit a bad tee shot on the last but no one really deserved to win in that game.   
 Q.  Sense of pride, though, coming out on top, seeing some of the team put a little blue on the board?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It's nice to see.  We all knew the guys were going to come out firing today to try and get a victory or to get a point for the team.  In the 18 matches before today, it's only 3 1/2 points, so I think everyone was anxious to get more points on the board.   
Yeah, a lot of us is going to play in two years' time together again.  So you're still playing for each other, and you're playing for yourself today, as well, to give yourself that belief that you can beat these guys in singles.
