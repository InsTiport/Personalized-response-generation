  Q. Did you feel like the round came to you?
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   The front nine I couldn't get it going.  I wasn't hitting it great on the front nine.  Left myself in a few awkward spots, and then made so many mistakes on the 9th hole.
 But then sort of the break was really good, let me just relax for 15 minutes and go back fresh and started really -- I had a wedge in on 10.  Hit a solid wedge.  Hit a good 5-iron on the next and made the putt.  That sort of got the round going there.  Then me and Harris were sort of feeding off each other.  Yeah, 68 around this track is probably not great, but I'll take it for going into tomorrow.
 Q. Dustin has been playing well this week, won more than 20 PGA TOUR events.  I assume you're expecting him not to back up.  Does that alter your strategy if you want to put yourself into contention to win?
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Well, there's so many names on there that's definitely not going to back off, but Dustin is definitely one you can expect him to go out and shoot at least 4- or 5-under.  I mean, I need to put myself in just a little bit better positions.  Today was not great on the front nine.  I didn't give myself many opportunities.  I need to give myself opportunities and I'm rolling the ball nicely on the greens.  I just need to play a little better.
 Q. Yesterday you talked about the fact you feel comfortable on this golf course.  How much of an advantage is that for you heading into the final round?
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, that 68 today felt like a 74 to me.  It felt awkward, like I said, the front nine was not good.  Luckily in the back I played a little better but I feel really comfortable around this golf course, and you know, I just need to go ahead and play hard tomorrow.
