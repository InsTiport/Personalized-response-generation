Q. I know that didn't end the way you wanted it to finish, but just some comments about the match.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I'm gutted. But we played well. I made one mistake, one mistake on 16 with a tee shot, and that was it. The rest was pretty clutch golf, but there was lots of birdies between the two of us. It was a good match.
Q. Were you watching the leaderboard?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I knew the last matches were going to be very crucial. Obviously we started really strong. We're just gutted. Obviously we wanted a different result this week.
