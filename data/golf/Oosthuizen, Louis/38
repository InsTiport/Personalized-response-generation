Q. You go birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie to essentially put the match away.  Congratulations.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, thank you.  You know, I got on the first hole and had a little ten-foot putt and I've been struggling this week get those length putts on line.  And I found something on that stroke and just started rolling the ball beautiful.  I started making putts, I started seeing the lines better because I was confident on my lines.  And not just the putter, I was hitting it pretty decent, as well.  And then I felt bad for Tommy in a sense because I was making everything.  I think I was 8 or 9-under, I'm not sure.
Q. I knew you were putting well, you made 8 birdies on Thursday.  But I also wondered if your driver would cooperate today.  How was your driver?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it was better.  There was a few -- there's a certain shot that I'm working on.  And today even on 14 and 15 I just didn't get it quite right.  But, you know, I hit good drives.  Whenever I sort of needed to hit a good drive I did a good one and it's getting there.  Hopefully I can sort that out tomorrow.
Q. Thoughts on Marc Leishman for your Saturday date?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: That will be a good match.  Marc is playing some good golf.  I know it will be a good match.  We're good mates, so it's always tougher when you play someone that you really like.
Q. A little Presidents Cup rematch.  Congratulations.  See you Saturday.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Thank you.
