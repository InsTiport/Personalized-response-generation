 Q. Thoughts and feelings today? 
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Disappointed with the round. Hit it well but couldn't make a putt. Could have got it to 17, 18. So just not -- didn't happen. So a bit disappointed.

 Q. Putting, was it just not going in?
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: With the greens being a little bit softer, and a little bit slower, just struggled to hit the lines right and the speed right, and it was just disappointing. Hit it very close on a lot of holes, and just didn't make the putts, but hopefully tomorrow. 

 Q. Still in it. 
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: If the scoring, if the weather is like this tomorrow, I think it's going to be difficult catching Michael. But you know, it always depends how you start. If you start off well, you never know.

 Q. You've done it before here. 
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I'm going to try again. 

 Q. And in terms of coming back and playing it again in competition?
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It's really nice playing with my brother but trying to focus on getting a low score out there and just didn't happen.

 Q. The form's come right back. 
 LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I feel comfortable with my swing. Yesterday and the day before I putted nicely, but today, I just struggled.
