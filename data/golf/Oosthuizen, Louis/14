Q. 71, 1-under. What pleased you most about your play?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it was solid. Just one hole I messed up with hit are four or five bad shots on the par 5. Just made double-bogey out of nowhere, really and missed a few fairways on the front nine, and it's brutal. You can't miss fairways around this golf course the way it's set up. You know, the greens are getting really crispy. I think the boys this afternoon are going to have a tough time on the greens.
Q. You've been coming here since 2004. Ever known it to play this difficult?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: No. This is by far the toughest I've ever seen it. The fairways are tight. The rough is close to U.S. Open standards, and the greens is rock hard and really crispy. I would think they would water it tonight.
Q. Five top-six finishes for you in your last six starts, either side of Christmas. What's clicked in your game?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Just a lot of things that I've been working on is sort of coming together, and rolling it nicely. Making a few putts here and there. Just need to keep on doing what I'm doing.
