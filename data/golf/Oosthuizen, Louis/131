Q.   Fifth time in this championship and you are through to the third round.   Are you pleased with that? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, very pleased.   I played pretty solid today.   I just kept it together. 
Henrik didn't start very well. 
I made an early lead.   So it was 2‑over through 2 and 3‑up through 4.   Just played solid and made nice putts on the back nine.

Q.   When you are 3‑up on someone like Henrik through 12 holes, what are feeling?   How are you playing the game at that point? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Well, I just thinking the whole time that he's going to come back with something.   He's too good a player to just go and lie down.   I made a beautiful putt on 13 to stay 3‑up. 
14, he missed a short one to get one back on me.
Then I made another one on 15.   I putted really well today and I made quite a few birdies and an eagle, as well.   I'm playing well.   I'm just trying to keep the ball in play so that I'm in every hole I'm playing.
