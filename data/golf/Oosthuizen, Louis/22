 Q.  Third round of 71. Give us your thoughts on that one.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Scrappy. Very scrappy. Yeah, not on top of the irons and not hitting it really close enough. Can't expect to make birdies from a long ways all the time.   
Come out tomorrow and find that swing I had on Thursday.   
 Q.  Your goal for the day was to maintain better focus. You said yesterday you felt fatigued. Did you manage to do that?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it was good. Body feels great. I had a great rest last night and I felt really strong this morning. No issues there. Just need to play better.   
 Q.  Obviously Xander has the warm-up-shot lead going into the final round and you'll be out there in the final match with him. How will you be approaching it tactically?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Same thing. I need to give myself more chances on the greens, decent chances for birdies, not from 30, 40 feet away all the time. But yeah, probably a little bit more aiming towards the pins tomorrow and just try and put a little pressure on him. You know, just keep in play and keep in touch.   
 Q.  You've come awfully close to winning this championship in the past. What would it mean for you to come out on top in what is called "Africa's Major"?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: This is the tournament growing up as a kid you watched, and wanting to have your name on that plaque walking up the 9th hole there. It would mean a lot. But I need to play a little better tomorrow.
