Q. You had plenty of time to think about it during the rain delay.  How much calculation -- were you looking over the computer as you were sitting in the clubhouse?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   We lost the main math guy there, what he said, I need birdie to pretty much make it on the number.  I thought I needed birdie.  I thought I probably might need eagle.
But yeah, out on the golf course with about four or five holes to go, I was telling myself, just try and make two more birdies and see where it goes.  I was hitting it should poorly and just playing horrible.  Proud of the way I finished just on a hard day to just get it done.
Q. Did it feel a little like trying to win a tournament or even something of that caliber coming down the stretch?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It felt that way because everyone sort of knew what was going on, and even Scottie was going "Come on, make a good swing" and motivating me, and everyone I walked past knew I needed birdie.
Yeah, it was definitely some pressure on me, but luckily that 3-iron is probably one of my favorite clubs in my bag and I always hit some decent shots with it.  So I was happy with that yardage.  I just needed to make the swing.
Q. Considering where you started the week, how proud are you of what you've accomplished?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I'm very chuffed going into next week.  I was very disappointed on my round today.  Honestly I had no control over anything.  It was all over the place and up until four or five holes to go, it just sort of gave myself a little bit of an opportunity, just to at least have a chance for birdies.
But it was just fight, fight.  I never got down on myself.  I honestly just tried to see if I can give myself a putt somewhere for birdie.  I made a massive putt on 16 for birdie.  At the end of the day, I'm probably most happy 73 that I've had in a while.
