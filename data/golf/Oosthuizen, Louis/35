 Q. How would you assess your round?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Well, it was solid. When I was in trouble I sort of found a way to make par and drove it nicely. Feel like the ball‑striking was pretty decent today. Some really benign shots. And around this golf course even if you hit a good iron shots the greens difficult.  
   
 Q. Talk about the conditions.   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it was a lot of different‑‑ 15, we thought 15 was raining well. And just as I was about to hit my tee shot, 16 started raining, and my cap wasn't really enough, but I didn't want to change it. So, yeah, it was off and on. But still the greens might have been a little bit slower, but not a lot.   
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I just need a solid round tomorrow and stay in touch with everyone. This golf course, you win it on the back nine on Sunday. We've seen over the years anything can happen on the back nine.  
   
 Q. Talk about the weekend, do you know you have to get aggressive sometimes?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I think tomorrow is a day where you just really want to hit some good shots. Really, like I say, not try too much and play yourself out of the tournament. You just want to have a decent round and then Sunday there are a lot of holes where you want to be very aggressive.
