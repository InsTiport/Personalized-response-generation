 Q.   I know it was a tough round for you.   Really struggled early.   You did well on the back-9.   Just comments.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   It was a rough day.   I can't really pinpoint hitting terrible shots.   I had horrific lies on 5 and 8, ball with mud and making two double bogies, you know, at the time I was trying to push to try and make par or bogey on them, but just tried a bit too hard.   The two birdies would have done a playoff for me.   It was disappointing.   I kept in there and made a bogey on 14, but other than that, I'm happy with the way I came back.  
   
 Q.   Still some positive signs for you the way you played all week heading into Augusta?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I'm not going to be bothered about the way I played the front-9.   I had a few horrific lies and bounces.   It happens.   Another day it goes my day.   Yeah, I'm very positive in going to Augusta.  
   
 Q.   With the mud balls, was it was a tougher day with a little more wind?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   A little bit more wind.   I struggled the first four holes to get the wind right, but, you know, once you get to 6, 7, I feel like I could feel the wind a bit better.   It was pretty much like this the first-9, but it was just not my day.  
  
Q.Besides The Open, this is one of your best performances on the PGA TOUR, correct?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I think so, yeah.   You know, obviously disappointed in not getting the win, but I'm taking a lot of positives out of this.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel as good today as did yesterday?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   You were hot yesterday?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I felt really good.   I would like to go through the front-9 and see all the shots I hit, because I can't really say any bad, bad shot I hit, you know, was just like I said, two bad lies with the two double.   Could have been completely different.  
   
 Q.   Take out one of those and --  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah.   Lot of positives.   Hunter played well.   He deserved it.
