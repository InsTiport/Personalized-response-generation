  LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I felt like I played pretty solid again.   Probably missed a few greens and I putted well again. 
But yeah, on the second hole, I hit a very loose tee shot, ended up left in the rough in the bushes, and made bogey on the par5 which a bit disappointed; it was downwind today.   But other than that, played really well.

Q.   Last four starts, not outside the top six; are you really close to your top form?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I feel like I'm pretty close to it.   You know, I'm hitting a lot of greens, giving myself a lot of opportunities for birdies. 
You know, I'm starting making a few putts and these greens are quite quick, which I like, and seemed like I'm putting pretty well the last two days. 

Q.   26th to 6th in the World Rankings this year; how high can you go? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   We'll see.   Got four events left, so this win and another three, so we'll see.

Q.   South Africa playing England tomorrow; fancy your chances at the rugby?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I'll never bet against my boys, so I think we are going to have a good one.
