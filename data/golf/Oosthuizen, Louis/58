Q. Your first start on the PGA TOUR this year?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I had to pull out of the Joburg Open end of last year, and bit of a rough start to the season, but had a good three-week break.  I live across the street, so worked on the game.  Knew this week was always going to be tough.
Q. How much how much difference does that make, sleeping in your own bed?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, it doesn't feel like you're at a tournament.  It just feels like you're going for a round of golf.  When I'm here, I play almost every day, so it feels the same thing.  It's just a few more people walking with and watching you.
Q. Highlights on the closing stretch --
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, my caddie's been giving me some good lines on the greens, so the last few holes, I just listened to him.
Q. Players have been talking about the greens.  Are they bumpy out there?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I think it's difficult on your eye, especially chipping.  You don't know if it's going to grab something or if it's just going to release.  There's not a lot of grass on it.  But yeah, it felt like it was running okay, but at the end there, you could see it was I little bumpy.
I had a 6-iron in that just didn't catch it perfect and as I hit the bunker shot I knew it was a good line and I couldn't see anything.
Q. So running towards the first major, is your schedule going to be very heavy from now on?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I'm in so far, the next five, five in a row, week off, and Augusta.  I think everyone has got Augusta on their mind already and working towards it.  Got to get momentum going into Augusta.
