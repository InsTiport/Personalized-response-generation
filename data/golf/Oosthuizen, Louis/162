  LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it was a good week.   Played really well.   Probably a bit cold on the weekend.   You know, didn't hit it as good as I wanted to to give myself good opportunities for birdies.   But all in all, fifth, quite happy with that, and I've got to look forward to next week now. 

Q.   Looked frustrating on that final day though?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I was trying, same with Charl.   Charl didn't make any putts.   I wasn't hitting it very well and then just didn't finish great.   Hit in the water on 18, my tee shot, so always disappointed with that.   But all in all, I must say, I'm very happy with the week. 

Q.   Given that this is a prominent finish from you and good scoring all week, you have to give an appreciation of Justin Rose with a 62 to close, and Rory McIlroy, what he achieved. 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, 62 today was some score.   I think all of us see low scores out there, 64, 65, but you've got to hole putts. 
But again, Rory just birdieing four of the last four and he's still got the 18th; he's probably playing the golf that Tiger was playing when he was on form.   So at the moment, he's in his own little world, which is great to see and good for him.

Q.   You were not far off that and you've still got work to do this year?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I've still got a few tournaments left and still need to tweak a little more things there but I'm happy with my game at the moment.
