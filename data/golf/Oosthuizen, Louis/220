   LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I felt I hit it nicely yesterday and today but yesterday was struggling with the putter. Today o got the speed a bit better so my ball is at least giving the hole a scare. Yesterday I couldn't get the ball to the hole so pleased to get it up there today and I am hitting it nicely.   
 I think we wanted a quick turnaround and then get out there again. Played seven holes this morning and highlight was probably my par save on 14. I thought I cleared the bunker with my tee shot but didn't and was plugged in the lip. Just had to chip out sideways and I hit it to 25 feet and made the putt for par. That just kept the momentum a bit and then made a nice birdie on the 16th.
