Q. You must be delighted with that effort?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  Yes I played really well today and I am very happy. Coming up the 18th fairway I said to my caddie that I thought I had only hit two bad iron shots the whole day, the tee shot on the tenth with a two iron and my second shot on the 16th, I just missed to the right with that. My second shot on the 17th I thought was all right but it just caught the slope and came up short, I was lucky not to go in the bunker though. I took my punishment and putted to the side and made two more putts for five.
Q. Nice way to bounce back with a birdie at the last though?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yes, I was pleased with that. I decided to hit my drive on the last as hard as I could because it is the biggest fairway in the world but I went so far left that it was just in the fairway! But then I pitched to ten feet and holed for a birdie which was nice.
Q. Your eagle at the 12th?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  It was quite easy to get there today with driver, just a normal drive was fine there today. I pushed it slightly to the right and I finished on the right edge of the green and I had to go up the slope and it was probably about 45 feet in all and it just went in on the last roll, it just caught the side of the lip and dropped in. I hit two par fours with my driver yesterday and two today as well, I hit the ninth too.
Q. Any other memorable shots today?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  My bunker shot on the 14th, the par 5. I had a 2-iron in there and just pulled it slightly and I was short left in the bunker. I had to pitch it right on top of the mound to release down to the hole and I played it perfectly, just as I wanted it to and it rolled down to about a foot and a half from the hole and holed that for a birdie.
Q. Looking forward to Carnoustie tomorrow?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Oh, yes, if the weather stays like this. I donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t know what the weather is going to be like tomorrow, but it is just a privilege to play all these great courses.
Q. You played the Old Course as an amateur?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:  Yes, in the 2002 St Andrews Links Trophy but never as a professional. This was my first competitive round as a professional here Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ not a bad way to start.
