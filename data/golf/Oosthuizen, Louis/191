 Q.   Good win out there.   Aaron is a tough opponent, a guy that can putt always gives more fits in match play.   Just talk about the win and how important it is to get off to a good start in this event?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it was a bit shaky during the middle of the round.   I gave a few holes to him with bad iron shots, but I hung in there.   And I always knew it was going to be a tough match against him and luckily today I putted really well and the greens were running really nice.   You know, it's ‑‑ it could have gone either way.  
   
 Q.   Any key moments in the round where it looked like the score might go one way and you were able to get up‑and‑down?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Well, I made a 6‑footer or a 5‑footer on 12 to stay level and then hit it in the trap on 13.   He had a birdie putt and I made a 10‑footer to stay all square.   He missed a 3‑footer on 15, which changed everything.   It could have been ‑‑ I could have been one or two down playing 15, so just hung in there nicely.  
   
 Q.   The match play format, is it one you like?   Have you had experience with it?   
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it's ‑‑ you don't really play it too often.   I like it.   Haven't really had good success with it yet, but hopefully that will change this week.
