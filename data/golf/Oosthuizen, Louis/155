  LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I hit the ball really well again today.   I hit it nicely yesterday, but you know, making the odd mistake yesterday, missing two greens in regulation and making bogeys on them, just not getting the putts in the hole.   I'm struggling on the greens to get the ball up to the hole, so, yeah, I'm just having a bit of a tough time on the greens.

Q.   Sounds very frustrating yet you're in a nice sort of position?
    LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I could probably shoot a nice one today, a good number, 66, 65, but 68, no bogeys, I'm happy with that.   I'm always happy with a no bogey round.   Hopefully tomorrow I can make a charge and I need to shoot very low. 

Q.   I daresay you've seen what others are doing, so you do feel that low one is in there, do you? 
    LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it's difficult to say.   I didn't see myself making any putts, so it's difficult to see yourself shooting a real low one.   But I think probably be a bit more aggressive tomorrow and try and get them close. 

Q.   Is there a reason for it on the greens?   Is it the greens themselves?   Is it purely down to you? 
    LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I feel like I'm hitting some good putts.   I think the greens are probably not in the best shape it can be, but you know, that's one of those; the other guys are making putts, so I need to get my act together to make a few as well.

Q.   Another couple of sessions on the putting green, that sort of thing?
    LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I just need to find the right way to roll them to get a bit of almost a topspin on them to get it to the hole.   So you know, I just need to work a bit on that.
