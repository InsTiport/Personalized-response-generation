Q.   Talk us through the match today. 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Me and Charl played really well.   I think we did proper better‑ball.   When he was out of the hole, I played well.   When I was out of it, he hit some amazing shots.   I left him with hard work on 17 and he hit that shot out of the bunker.   It was definitely a good feeling for me. 

Q.   You've played so much golf together.   Just talk us through how well you guys get along and how you understand each other?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, I just figure, we were 9‑under combined, so we played really good golf.   I felt like my good shots were really very good today.   I putted well, but then I also did some poor shots and that's where Louis came in and we really combined really well.   That's what you sort of need to do in this format, and that's where the two of us feel comfortable with each other.   You don't get down on yourself with a bad shot, because you know those sort of things happen, where if you don't know the other guy well, you might feel a little bit bad.   I think that's where we bond really well. 

Q.   Were you involved with the color‑coding today, green and gold for South African MoJo? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   We had no complaints with it. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, there was no complaints.
