Q.   Just some thoughts on the day.   You played nicely. 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I played nicely.   I mean, I missed a few shots, but made good up‑and‑downs on a few holes.   I played really well.   I drove it well and made nice putts. 
I still struggled on a few lines, to get the lines and speeds right.   I think speeds on these greens are crucial.   You can get really fast putts, and I think once you get uphill putts you have to be careful not to hit it by.   But I'm very happy on the two rounds.

Q.   Where do you rate this WGC event compared with the other four or three?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Well, it's the next one in line of any major, so it's just as big for me.   I would just like to have a good week this week and go in knowing that I'm playing well going into next week. 

Q.   Chip‑in at the last?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, used a putter actually.   It was right up against the fringe and decided on putting it.   It was still upset on the second shot that I hit it that far short.   The minute it left the face, I knew it had a good speed, so I hoped it got a good line, and it went perfect.

Q.   How much of your thoughts are on next week?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Not really thinking of next week yet, focused on this week, trying‑‑ working a bit with a coach, getting the game right, and yeah, you know, it's nice playing in this type of weather.   You can rely on that.   I hear it's going to be quite windy next week, and it should be good.

Q.   What else do you hear about next week?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Tough golf course and windy.   That's about it.   I haven't seen any of it.
