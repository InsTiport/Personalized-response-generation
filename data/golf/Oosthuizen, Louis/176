  LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it's probably‑‑ I really went at all the pins, took everything on.   I needed a low round today.   Went into six bunkers, I think which cost me I think three bogeys.   But all in all, I played really well, hit the ball really well.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I definitely hit it the best of the three days so far.   And I'm just glad I'm going upwards in the game, and hopefully tomorrow I can stay out of the traps.

Q.   How did you putt today? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I putted well today.   I putted really nice today.   I just changed a little thing, worked a bit on my putting, and I feel good today.

Q.   It's a simple thing?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, it's always a simple thing (laughter).   It's always something small that you just lose, but it's just nice to get it back.

Q.   How were the pin positions out there? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   There's a few tough pins, again.   And, you know, I think everyone just trying to go in there that you can't go into any traps with the water.   But I think there's only a few holes today that there were really water on.   16 around the greens there was a few bunkers.   But the rest of the bunkers actually looked okay. 
But I think I took most of the traps on and just knew I had to hit good shots.   And some holes it came off and others not. 

Q.   Talk about how Martin played. 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   He just struggled.   You could see he just didn't hit the ball really well.   And around this track if you miss the fairways you're going to pay the price.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   No, no, I think it was fine.   We all get one of those days.

Q.   How did you set yourself up for tomorrow?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   I need the wind to really blow out tomorrow to get the leaders to go backwards.   That's the only way.   If the weather stays like this it's going to be really tough to catch them.

Q.   There's wind in the forecast. 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Well, yeah, I still need to play well, then.   But I would like to see the wind blow, but I think the last three days was not what everyone was expecting weather‑wise.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, I just caught three or four holes in that strong wind and then we're done with my round.   But I think it was a bit stronger.   It was too strong, probably.   But I think if there is a good, strong breeze, a two‑, three‑club wind, it will be really good.

Q.   Did you have new sunglasses on today? 
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Oh, no, it's just some South African sunglasses I thought I'd wear today.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN:   Yeah, no, I'm always happy to show anything for my country.
