 Q.  Teeing off on 9, tell me about that?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I told him to take one for the tee and hit a 5-iron up there, because Vijay and them were still waiting for the green to clear.  I wasn't really sure what his call was.  I just made sure, I said listen -- I'll give you a beer tonight, just get it down there so that we can go.   
 Q.  How difficult is this golf course after the rain delay?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It was definitely softer on your approach shots.  But the putts still ran out.  I think it was a tough one because you sort of felt like you had to hit the putts a little harder because you could see on your second shots it was soft but for some reason still ran out pretty decent.   
Yeah, it was a big change.  You still had to hit the fairways because the rough was still brutal.   
 Q.  5-under, going into the weekend, good spot to be?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, three behind going into any major on the weekend is a great spot.  Hopefully I can follow it up with two solid rounds.   
 Q.  Sun will be up when you come back.  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I'll be sleeping.  Happy about that.   
 Q.  What's your mind-set when you come back from a delay?  
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: You know, sometimes when you're not playing great, it can be a great thing.  But you know, the way I was playing, I wanted to stay out there and play.  But yeah, just had to get my mind good.  I missed a fairway on my first tee shot on two, but I got lucky with having a decent lie and I gave myself a good birdie opportunity.  Missed the putt, though.   
You know, you just need to sort of try and find that momentum that you had.
