Q. After a disappointing day, nice to go out there and shoot low in very similar conditions?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, yesterday was very frustrating on greens.  I lost a little bit of rhythm in my stroke, and this morning just did something to pick it up again and rolling the ball a little better today.
Q. Great run of birdies, as well, on the back nine helped elevate you up that leaderboard.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, I was level through 8 and then sort of messed around a little bit on my stance in my putting stroke, and I didn't get the club off the blade the way that I wanted to.  Found a little something and started rolling the ball really nicely and made good putts for birdie on the back nine.
Q. Overall, what are the main positives you take out of this week?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, the stuff I'm doing, the stuff I'm working on is working, and I need to just keep on working at it and not try and do that 75; after four rounds, don't get that bad round in there.  Just work on consistency and doing the would.
Q. And getting the win already in South Africa this season, how much confidence has that given you going forward?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: A lot.  It's great to start your season off with a win, and hopefully I can do a few more this year.
