Q.  Assess the week, just wasn't quite to be was it?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  Disappointed.  I hit the ball great, but the putting today, the last three days, has been awful for some reason.  Didn't go in the hole.  That's the way it is.

All credit to Monty, he's played well over the last half of the season, and I'll get him next year.
Q.  Did you enjoy knowing that it was down to only a couple of you the last few months?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  Yes, really the last round, even the last 18 holes.
Q.  Right to the wire.
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  Yeah, it's fun for myself and fun for everyone else watching it, too.  Obviously I'm disappointed and I managed to stumble over the finishing line.  I can't complain on the year.  I've had a great year and it would have been nice to top it off.
