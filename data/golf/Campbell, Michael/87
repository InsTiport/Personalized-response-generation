 Q. How did it go out there today?
 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Oh, rough today. I was lucky to shoot 1-under really. Just up and
down, I think, emotionally. My focus today, my concentration was pretty nice and pathetic.
 
 
Q. Nice having someone to play with today, then?
 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: The participating holes, yeah. He played great too, by the way. He
played good. 
 
Q. What do you think you have to do over the weekend now?
 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Oh, shoot low, I think. I have to shoot low both rounds. What is Nick
Price at? 10-under, something like that. I'll probably be 9 shots behind after 36 holes.
So there's still a chance, obviously, but I have to shoot low.  
 
Q. How tough was it out there today with the wind?
 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Reasonably. It wasn't that tough, I don't think. Calc shot, what?
5-under, I think it was. It was a good score. 5-under today was a good score. I think
Mathias Gronberg shot 3-under or 4-under, did he? 5-under? Whatever he shot. It's
definitely there to go low; but unfortunately, I wasn't good enough today. 
 
Q. What do you think about your other contenders in the Order of Merit race? Monty shot
67 today. The others?
 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: I don't care what the other guys did, no.
