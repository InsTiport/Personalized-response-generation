  MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Ever since May last year, I've had some great results, so it's nice to finally have it pay off.   It's been a struggle for the last four, five years but finally it's nice to see my name on the leaderboard and just in contention.   That's why I play this game is to win golf tournaments.

Q.   If you look at your career, you had a chance to win The Open in '95, and then you come back and win the U.S. Open.   What do you make of it? 
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   I have no idea.   I have no idea why.   I just do it.   I've done it since I was an amateur, since I was a kid, shooting 80s or 65s.   Why, I have no idea, no idea.   It's just so frustrating, but that's me and I've got to accept that and move on. 
Now I've gone over to the other side of playing well again, which is nice, and it's always nice to see your name on the leaderboard finally.

Q.   You're a Major Champion, I'm assuming you know when your game is good enough to get the victory; is it good enough to do it tomorrow?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   It's a tough call.   I think Justin is playing wonderful golf, so he'll be hard to beat.   It's going to take a miracle tomorrow.   I've got to shoot at least a 63, 64 to have a chance tomorrow. 
But it is possible.   Tournaments I've won, where there's been a guy who has been ten shots behind have won a tournament, including a major, so it is possible.   But all I can do is go out here tomorrow and just focus on my own game, can't control anybody else's, especially Justin's.
