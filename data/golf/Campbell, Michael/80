MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  I missed from 18 inches at the first, and that rocked me and probably caused me to bogey the second as well, but after that I did pretty well and it was a good back nine, coming home in 31 in a stiff breeze. Overall though we were lucky with the weather. It was pretty calm and quite warm for this part of Scotland at this time of year. Now I just want to concentrate on putting together a good score at Kingsbarns tomorrow.

It's been good playing with Herb Kohler, 17-under. He chipped in a couple of times and we get on well.

There is always buzz about playing here, when he get off the 18th tee and walk those last few yards looking up at the big clubhouse and the clock and soaking up the atmosphere. Of course I get a buzz thinking back to the Open eight years ago, reliving the shots - good and bad.
