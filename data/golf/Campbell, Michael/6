 Q.   Your verdict?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, it's always nice to shoot under par, first time out this year.   First time I broke 70 here at this golf course.   It's always nice to do that.   Best out so far for a while and it's nice I kept the momentum going from last year.   
It is nice to keep it going because after a break, you sometimes wonder whether it's all there.   You do, but what I did this time around that was very different or unusual was I played a lot over the Christmas period and decided to keep on going and just swing the golf club really.   That kind of helped me a lot to get into the game very quickly.   
Played with my son and played with mates, as well, which is always nice to have a bit of fun and I think it's made a big difference so far.   Also had a good session with my coach last week in Spain, so that was good, too.   
   
 Q.   And I presume you're excited about the season, given the way last year finished?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, absolutely, I think after finishing so strongly the last three, four months, it's nice to come out and shoot a nice score today and hopefully keep the round going.   
   
 Q.   Any particular thing that worked immediately?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, I made a few, you know, stupid errors at the start of my round, the first nine holes, making bogeys from nowhere really but as you said, it's rust.   Just hung in there and knew that I was playing well enough to shoot under par today in some tough conditions with strong holes finishing.   
It was nice to shoot under par.   The front nine is always the hardest nine of the two, and it's nice to shoot under par for those.   
   
 Q.   Good foundation for the week with that score?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, this is my best round around this golf course, so it's definitely a great start to my 2013 season.
