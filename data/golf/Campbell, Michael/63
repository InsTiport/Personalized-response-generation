MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  Still got a chance of winning obviously. I just wanted to put myself in striking distance and I have, two shots behind with two rounds to play. It is anyone's game.
Q.  You spoke about losing concentration  a little from time to time -- did that happen today?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  A little bit on 11 and 12. I three putted 11 and then bogeyed the 12th and then missed a real tiddler on the 17th.
Q.  How important was the one on the 18th?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  Just tried to focus. 17th was a bit of a shocker. Six foot away and putting for birdie and three putted from there. That was a loss of concentration but I came back strongly from there.

I wasn't that sharp today which was a bit unfortunate but still managed to shoot 71 and I am only two back. I still have a chance but need to play well tomorrow. It is basically tiredness. It has been a big six weeks to me since winning the US Open and then playing so well last week. It takes a lot out of your mentally and physically. Today I felt a little down through tiredness but I will rest up tonight and tomorrow you never know.
