 Q.   Your thoughts starting the tournament?  
    MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   It's always nice to get off to a good start, anything under 70 on this golf course is very good but mind you, benign conditions out there and it's there for the taking and there are a few holes that are pretty easy out there, so anything under 70 is a good score.   
   
 Q.   Well, you've been coming here for many a year and you've seen it in all kinds of guises and particularly this is as easy as it gets?  
    MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   This is the calmest I've ever seen Doha, that's for sure.   It's definitely a day to remember in the sense of the wind.   It's been a great day so far, and, look, I'm happy with the 68, I'm 4â€‘under, in touch with the leaders after the first round.  
   
 Q.   If the wind is picking up, you've got the driving distance, but are there things that are possible in this weather that you have not been able to do before?   
    MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, just hit normal shots.   Recently playing in Doha, it normally blows, and you need to golf the ball quite well, low fades, high fades, all sorts of shots out there.   Today just go ahead and just play normal golf, which is kind of nice here in Doha.   So look, it's a fun golf course to play.   The greens are a little bit grainy but besides that it's always nice to play.   
   
 Q.   Last week?  
    MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, disappointing last round, even par, last week my putting was very average.   Worked on it last night and before I played today, also, and putted a lot better today.   
   
 Q.   Presumably not that broke; doesn't take a huge fix?   
    MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   No, it takes something very, very, very simple and it was basically my putting stroke was a little bit fast, need to slow down a little bit more and have a bigger backswing and it helped me a lot today.
