  MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   I came here with no expectations really.   I just wanted to have some fun with my golf and today was a great example.   I was in contention.   I was one or two shots off the lead at one stage.   Stumbled on 13 and 14 unfortunately but besides that, it was a good‑‑ putts on 15 and 17, were nice birdie holes there.   I think I'm two short but besides that, it was a good, solid week.

Q.   Do you walk away thinking that you let one slip away?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   No, just delighted‑‑ if someone said to me at the start of the week, look, Michael, you'll finish third or fourth after this week, I'd be very happy indeed.   I'm happy to be up there now and just in contention.   I felt very calm out there once again.   
It's surprising, I haven't been amongst it for such a long time.   Felt like yesterday.   It's incredible.   I felt very much in control of my emotions and very much in control of my golf swing, so it's a nice feeling. 

Q.   Well, there are so many positives aren't there, not only the mood, but the manner of the scoring, the way you've executed shots under pressure I guess?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, as I said before, it was great.   It was a good feeling to have.   I really enjoy those sort of feelings, being in amongst the hunt and hopefully a chance to win.   But once again I'm happy to walk away with third or fourth place.   I wanted to birdie the last hole to have any chance at all to put pressure on the boys behind me but wasn't to be. 

Q.   What's next? 
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   I'm looking forward to playing in China, BMW Masters in two weeks' time.
