Q.  You must be pleased with a top-five?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  It's been a bit of a struggle in the last four months and it's nice to come up and play great. Played nicely in four rounds in front of a tough field which had four guys in the top-10. It's really nice.
Q.  What are the positives that you've taken from this week?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  It's back to where I should be, back in contention apart from Adam running away with it. It was pretty close towards the end there but it was nice to get to within striking reach with the leaders.

I feel my game is coming along nicely and I'm really looking forward to playing next week in Shanghai and the rest of the season. It's my first top-10, so I'm really pleased.
