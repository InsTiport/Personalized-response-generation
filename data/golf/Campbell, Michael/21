   MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  It's very, very wet and soggy and it's a long walk out there for most of the guys.  Shooting 2-under in the first rounds is a good effort.   
  
  Q.  You've obviously come to a venue which gives you good memories although it's a different course.   
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  Still, it's a sense of the region.  It's not far away.  But I feel pretty good about my game.  And it's always nice to come back to a tournament where you've played well before, and I won five years ago and I think you try and cling on to those memories of five years ago and look forward to the next three days.   
  
  Q.  I take it the weather wasn't too much different then, was it?   
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  It always rains in Ireland.   
  
  Q.  What about the time of season it is, you're in good form, you're on a run of birdies, The Open is coming up.   
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  If you peak around June, July August, that's three months, three majors, good events.  It's nice to be hitting my stretch right now and I'm playing great from tee-to-green.  And once again, the opportunities weren't quite there for me for birdies today, but just be patient with it and hopefully they will fall tomorrow.
