I'm just two shots behind with two rounds to play. I just hope to keep the same thought process going into the weekend which will be the most important thing. Everything was working today but it was a shame I didn't convert a birdie opportunity on 16 but I made birdie on 17. Unlucky on 18.

It looks pretty ominous with Tiger being right amongst it. He's two shots behind the leader and so am I. You have to shoot low in the weekend, which is the bottom line. I hit three less greens today, but up-and-downed every time for pars. My iron play wasn't great. But I'm just trying to keep having fun out here.

I didn't start well with a bogey on one. I totally misjudged my second shot on the first hole and hit it 10 yards shot on the first green and made bogey there. But besides that, I hit it close on the second hole and missed a putt there but I had a solid round.

If I just play like I did on the first day, shoot a 67, I would say I would have a chance to win at the weekend.
