  MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   It was a fun day, real fun day today but unfortunately my putter went very cold on me.   Missed a few golden opportunities for pars and birdies the first nine holes   got me on the back foot a little bit.   And Miguel played some great golf, the first ten holes, 5‑under, he played superb golf there so it was hard to get back.   
I can reflect on this week as being a very positive week and I've still got things to work on, a work‑in‑progress, but once again, I can go away with my head up pretty high.  
   
 Q.   And it started so positively, that birdie at the first but that was kind of a story, birdie, bogey cancelled it out and another birdie, cancelled it out.   
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   It was very consistent again.   I think it was one of those years, really, where I needed to be more consistent and that's one thing I need to work on with my coach, Jonathan and hopefully we can do something for next year.  
   
 Q.   Do you fancy in the heat of battle like that.   The appetite was there and you're going well to the last?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   The hunger was definitely still there.   It was great fun.   Great fun and playing in a nice group, and your playing partner is winning the golf tournament, it's nice to be involved in that sense.   
I wish I was Miguel, but once again, lots of positives this week, and I can go away from this week and just work on a few more things.   I think I'm headed in the right direction now.  
   
 Q.   A good sign, as well, that you've taken it on the chin; that you are very reasonable and assured about things, and, hey, you're smiling.   
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, that's one thing I'm trying to work on is still trying to enjoy myself.   It's just a game.   Yeah, disappointed.   I'm better now than I was 20 minutes ago.   Still, it's nice to be here and nice to be in contention.  
   
 Q.   Having played alongside the 48‑year‑old, he's the oldest‑ever winner on The European Tour, that's quite something from Miguel Ãngel JimÃ©nez, isn't it?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   It's still inspiring for me.   I'm five years younger and I've got time on my side.   Once again, a great positive.   
   
 Q.   Can we elaborate, is there just something special about the way he plays the game, his demeanor?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   He's got so much experience, Ryder Cup player and he's won a lot of times on The European Tour.   He's got a ton of experience.   Just one of those things where he's a great, great player, good iron player, and also a good putter, good short game.   So the combination of that is pretty deadly.  
   
 Q.   And with his approach which is just sort of a laissez faire attitude it seems half the time.   
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Very relaxed and that's one thing I love about the way Miguel plays golf.   I wouldn't say he doesn't care but he's got a relaxed attitude and brings a lot of suss says.  
   
 Q.   For you onwards, upwards, what's next?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Unfortunately, as you know, it's the end of the year.   I wish it was the start of the year.   But it's the end of the year.   I've got one left in Johor in Malaysia and that's it really, end of story.   End of another year.   But hopefully next year will be off with the same sort of momentum and attitude.
