Q.   67 around here in breezing conditions, pretty good going. 
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, we were lucky once again.   I think the first eight holes, no breeze whatsoever.   And then the last probably ten holes is where it was very, very gusty, very testing.   You know, it's one of those courses where it swirls around a lot and gusts a lot, so you're going to be unlucky sometimes.
My round really was on the third hole, hit driver, 3‑wood to about six‑foot and made eagle there. 

Q.   And one of those that demands precision, as opposed to length. 
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, that's something that works to my advantage.   I'm not exactly the longest off the tee.   So as you say, being precise is more important than being long this week.

Q.   Most of us just enjoy coming to Hong Kong; are you one of those?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   I love Hong Kong, the city itself.   It has a great buzz to it.   I love the culture and I love the food here.   It's very cosmopolitan and it's always a lot of fun to come here.

Q.   And the nature of the course, old school with the terrace?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   It's very English, yes.   I got told off yesterday for wearing my hat inside the clubhouse.   I had to take it off. 

Q.   I saw the piece you did for TV, wanting the extra 15 yards with your drive and the work on that but also your inspiration for some of the other older guys, if you like, that are doing well out here.   
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, I've been playing with these guys for the last 20 years.   Of course I joined The European Tour back in 1995.   So I know them very, very well and I've beaten them a lot of times, and they have beaten me a lot of times. 
And to see the longevity of it, they are playing so well:   Paul Lawrie, Thomas BjÃ¶rn, Ernie Els winning his fourth major, all in the 40s club.   We are all around that 40 mark. 
So it's very inspirational, very inspirational for me to keep on plugging away because I know I'm good enough to do well again and to see my mates, my friends, do well definitely makes me want to work harder.

Q.   I suppose it works two ways, gives you a bit more belief and also that added competition that you want to do as well as your mates?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Absolutely.   Look, I really admire what they have done for themselves and to go through highs and lows like me, I seem to go through a lot of them, extreme highs, extreme lows.   But for them, as well.   They are great players, very good players and they have had their ups and downs. 
Paul Lawrie is a prime example:   Bounced back the last couple of years fantastically, and to me that's very inspirational.   He's around the same age as me, 42, 43.   One thing about this game is that age is no barrier.   That's one thing that makes me keep on coming back.
