MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  The last three days my putting let me down a lot. I missed a few from about three feet. The greens are very challenging and are pretty young and there are a few spike marks around but five or six shots off the lead with 18 holes to play isn't much really. We will see what happens tomorrow.

Yes, I will be aggressive. There is no point in coming second or third. It's going to be tough to beat. David Howell is playing really well, so is Tiger, so it's going to be a great challenge for me for tomorrow to win this thing but it is possible.

I am playing reasonable. Not 100 pecent. I played okay the last three days. I know I have been nominated as Maori Sportsman of the Year, and I am looking forward to going back to New Zealand for the dinner and I might just pip the others (nominated). The others are obviously very talented but I suppose it's been a great year for me and I can't really complain.
