  MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Tough, cold, windy, but the low ball striking suits me round these courses. Nice to have five birdies in six holes and nice to get this one under my belt. I am feeling confident technically, which means I can go play with a clear mind. It was good to get Carnoustie out of the way in weather that wasn't too bad even though I am freezing but I think I have got a shot at it this week because I trust the way that I am playing and because I think that I have the toughest of the three courses out of the way. Left some putts out there still today and can improve on that aspect tomorrow.
