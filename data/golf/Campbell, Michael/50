Q. How was your round?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  It was okay today.  It wasn't great, wasn't brilliant.  All credit to Monty.  He played great today.  It's tough to score on this golf course.  I'm only a few shots behind him in the lead, and we have three rounds to go and anything can happen in three rounds.
Q.  Especially on this golf course.
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  Absolutely.  Especially the 17th hole can produce a few doubles and triples.

So it's just a very fickle golf course.  I've just got to be patient out there tomorrow, the next three days, really, and pick up some round.
Q.  How was your own game today?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  It was all right.  Wasn't great, wasn't brilliant, but all right.  I realize it's my first    I think in several weeks, my second stroke play event, so I haven't had much.
Q.  Hard to get into stroke play rhythm?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:  Yeah, I was thinking of picking my ball up.  But it's been a very eventful day, and I'm working just a little bit more hard on my game and come out tomorrow firing.
