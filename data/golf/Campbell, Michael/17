   MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Unfortunately the first nine the putter was cold on me. Came back strong on the back nine and came close but wasn't good enough. I am showing good signs of where I should be and I am competing again. It's nice to see I am back where I should be. It has been a long hard road but through working hard on my game, keeping it nice and simple, it is paying off.  
 Couple of thirds, a fourth and a fifth. Keep on knocking and hopefully the door will open but I have come a long way from two or three months ago when I couldn't make the cut and now I am competing again. There is no secret, just back to basics. I am enjoying it, not thinking too much about technique and just going and playing golf.
