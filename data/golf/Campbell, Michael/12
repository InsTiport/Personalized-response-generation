  MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   A long time between drinks but just fun being out there competing against these great players, wonderful players.   I was actually quite surprised that I'm quite calm out there, having not been amongst the mix for such a long time.   I still feel very comfortable with it.

Q.   Will you feel calm tomorrow?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Yeah, once again, I've won enough tournaments around the world to realize what to do tomorrow.   All you can do is go and play each shot as it comes and give it your best shot and just have some fun.

Q.   I know you talked about the work with your coach,   Jonathan, and that's been crucial, and what difference, what has that enabled you to do of late?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   It just frees my mind.   I've gone back to the basics.   We started during May this year at Wentworth and since then, I've had a few good results.   I've been with Jonathan for a very long time, broke up about three years ago and back together, and showing a bit of confidence, as well, and basically just enjoying my golf.   Swing‑wise, it definitely feels better out there under the heat, so it's very‑‑ I'm just pretty excited about tomorrow. 

Q.   In your mind, tell me how calm, how confident you feel now heading into Sunday?
MICHAEL CAMPBELL:   Surprisingly very confident, quietly confident.   I have no expectation out there, just enjoying it and just having fun with it.   There's one thing that happened to me over the last three or four years, I've put too much pressure on myself to perform, and now, I wouldn't say I don't care, but if it's your best shot, it's your best shot, and that's one thing I'm trying to mentally get over, just your best shot.
