 Q. Great day for New Zealand. 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Yeah, the rugby, I just heard we beat the Aussies, so that means we retain the cup in the Tri Nations. So I'm very happy indeed.

 Q. A bit like the England/Scotland rivalry?
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Better than that.

 Q. Worse than that? 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Yeah, just about.

 Q. Your 68 was pretty good, too. 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: A shame I didn't really finish it off after a pretty solid 15 holes. I made an error on 16 unfortunately, and then had birdie putts on 17 and 18. But got a chance for the weekend, for tomorrow and looking forward to that. 

 Q. Your game continues to improve. 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Yeah, it's just momentum, you know, it's amazing how that works in this game and I made the cut at The Open and finished 50th, finished 40th at the US PGA and two Top-10s. 
 So it's a gradual thing and it's confidence and it's building and building. Hopefully tomorrow shoot a low one and see what happens.

 Q. Definitely in with a chance. 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Yeah, Robert is a very, very good player. You've got to make birdies tomorrow. The greens are very, very receptive I think with the rain we've had over the last couple of days. It's going to be a fun time tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it.

 Q. Did you find the greens slower today?
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: A fraction slower. Didn't cut them obviously as many times as normally, but once again, the roll, the surface is fantastic and it's probably the best on tour this year, and all credit to the greens staff.

 Q. 66 tomorrow, happy with that?
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Maybe a little bit lower to have a chance to win to be honest. I haven't won for three years, so I'm looking forward to playing well tomorrow and not get too carried away just one shot at a time and just have some fun.
