 Q. Welcome Michael, the BMW PGA Championship is a big tournament for the players in the season? 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: "It think it's one of those tournaments where it's one of the flagship tournaments of the year. The European Tour are based here and it's good to see some of the guys like Vijay, Retief and Ernie playing. It shows there is a great respect for this week and I think BMW have done a great job in transforming this event over the last three or four year. I've played in the event for 13 years now I think and I've really seen it come to fruition. I really enjoy playing in it you know. I've had a lot of success here and I won the World Match Play Championship here three years ago and finished second in this event a long time ago.

 Q. It would be nice to go one better? 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Yeah absolutely. I love coming here and I know this golf course like the back of my hand. I've played here so many times so I have an advantage but so will a lot of guys who are playing here this week. 

 Q. Are you feeling confident going into the event? 
 MICHAEL CAMPBELL: It's been a very lean last couple of years but that's one week about golf that everything can be different.
