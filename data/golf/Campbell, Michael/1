 Q.  Making your Senior Open debut; are you satisfied with your performance?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL: No, disappointed.  Got off to a great start, 2-under after three, and then holed a chip on No. 5, so quick start, quick start, but unfortunately, I hit bad shots on 8 and 9 and two bogeys there.   
Last nine holes, disappointed, a lot of opportunities for birdies, but it's my third start as a senior.  Just turned 50 in February.   
 Q.  We are not seeing a lot of low numbers.  What are the challenges for the rest of the field?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL: Just the bunkers.  Every time you hit a 2-iron or 3-iron or driver off the tee you have a chance to hit in the bunker, and the bunker captures the ball every single time and also the pins are tucked in corners today and you won't see a low score.   
Been some good stuff there.  Got off to a very fast start, birdieing No. 3, hardest hole on the golf course, that was nice, 2-iron, 3-iron to about 20 feet, so that was a good start there.   
Got lucky on No. 5.  Chipped in for birdie there, 3-under after five, but unfortunately dropped on 6, 8 and 9 and stumbled home, really.  I had a few opportunities on 16, 17, 18.  Some I could have made, but hey, I'm happy with my start.  It's my first Senior Open.   
 Q.  If the wind picks up, there won't be many scores under par, is it?  
MICHAEL CAMPBELL: No, it's pretty tough out there.  The course is set up fairly but tough.  If you hit it in the wrong places, you're making bogey or double-bogey.  My thought process today was keep out of the bunkers, which I did, really.  Maybe just one fairway bunker but besides that, pretty solid round.  Once again, disappointed, no putts, the last four holes in a row, but in with a chance.
