  Q. Talk about the birdies on your round.   
 STEVE SCHNEITER: 9, I hit it in the rough and hit 9-iron up there and made about a 10-footer.   
 Then on 15, I hit just short of the green and knocked it up to five feet and made it.  
  
  Q. Is there something from this experience here that you can take back from previous ones?   
 STEVE SCHNEITER: I'm trying to figure that out right now but I'm sure there is. Any time I have an opportunity to play in something like this, a major, I learn quite a bit and it helps.   
 But I can't think of anything right now. Just disappointed in the way I performed.
