Q.  First off, can you talk about playing in the PGA Championship here at Medinah?
STEVE SCHNEITER:  Oh, I've looked forward to it.  It's a lot of fun and challenging, but it's good.  I played in '99.  The course is in great shape, and I had a good day today, so things are good.
Q.  Talk a little bit about the course, what you see, some of the scores coming in pretty low, what you thought of the course and what you see out there?
STEVE SCHNEITER:  Well, it was definitely a day to shoot a low round, and obviously they're shooting them.  So I think it'll get a little firmer as the week goes on, and the scores won't be as low.
Q.  I heard you had a pretty nice shot on 9 to finish up.  Can you talk about your last hole a little bit?
STEVE SCHNEITER:  I hit it left in the trees and had to hit kind of through some trees, and I was just hoping that it would go through them, and it did, and it ended up about 20 feet, two putted for par, finished even.
Q.  What are your expectations for tomorrow?  What would you like to see yourself do tomorrow?
STEVE SCHNEITER:  Just play good, trust my game and my swing, and everything else will take care of itself.
