 Q. To start with a bogey, four birdies, one other bogey after that. Tell us about your morning here? 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Yeah, drove it right under a tree and actually made a great bogey. So not that you feel good making a bogey, but with the bogey that I made, I was actually pretty happy. 
 The last couple of weeks I'm playing pretty good and not getting much out of it. It's a tough golf course this week. You know that if you shoot a couple under every day and you've got a good chance.

 Q. What about the conditions here? Everybody talked about how tough the rough is, the small greens. How would you evaluate the conditions this morning? 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: It's probably as hard tee to green, and the greens are tough all year. The rough is deep, I'd say people in the U.S. Open are keeping the maintenance here this year. It's a good test, a good golf course. It's just hard.

 Q. Last couple of holes I noticed 8 and 9 you had a little indecision on what club to hit. 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: We had a little more wind. Right in between both of them, right in between 5 and 4. Hit a good 5 and eight short and a bad 4 on nine. Fortunately we got both of them up-and-down. So a pretty good finish.

 Q. You haven't played in a lot of tournaments, but 219 in FedExCup points. 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Are you saying I've got a chance? 

 Q. At least today you've got to feel good about where you are. It's not Sunday, but a 2-under 68 and the sand save at the last gives you a lot of momentum for tomorrow. 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Absolutely. You want to finish on a good note. The last two up-and-downs were nice. The last couple of weeks I felt like I played well, just haven't gotten much out of it. Today I was a little more patient and had more fun with it.
