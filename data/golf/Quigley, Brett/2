 Q. 3-under, no bogeys, tough golf course. Tell me about today. 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Great golf course, played nice. I drove it really well, hitting the driver well, and if you do that out here, you've got a chance. Just really happy with my game. 
 I had a good two days at Brad and Billy's CVS Caremark Classic, so it was a little bit of confidence there and just carried over to today.

 Q. So it's been kind of hit and miss a little bit, so this last couple days was where it's at?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Definitely. Actually I just changed to the new Titleist driver, the new 910, and I'm hitting it nice, so I feel confident. Like I said, out here if you're driving it well, you can play it. If you're off a little bit, it's going to bite you.

 Q. This course is a little bit like home in the fact that it's in the northeast, got a little bit of that flavor, old-school golf course with big trees?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Definitely, big trees, big golf course, and good greens. Some undulations out there, and you've got to respect them.
