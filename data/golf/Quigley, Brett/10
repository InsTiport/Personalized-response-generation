  Q. Good round?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Yeah, it was solid. I played really well today and just certainly happy shooting under par out here any time.   
  
  Q. You haven't started as well this year as you would have liked. Putting?   
 BRETT QUIGLEY: You know, it's been a combination of everything. I actually felt like I played pretty good and just haven't had the results. It's been frustrating as heck for me. Really, I've been doing the same stuff today that I've been doing every other week, and today was just a little better result, and hopefully I'm starting a trend.   
  
  Q. How is the knee?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Knee is good. Still can't bend down really to read a putt like I'd like to, but it doesn't hurt hitting and it doesn't hurt walking. I couldn't ask for more with that.  
  
  Q. When does the medical exemption --  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: I'm done with that.  
  
  Q. You're done, so you're --  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: After Honda I was done.  
  
  Q. So you made the money?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: I had to make 80,000-something at Honda, and I'm done.  
  
  Q. And I hear you're having another girl?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Yes, Amy is having a girl. I'm going to be in there watching. Yes, another girl. We need some names, so if you have any, just leave them in my locker.  
  
  Q. September?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Yes, September 13th, I believe. Hopefully that's an off-week. I think they schedule one in there about that time. I don't know what it is, in between the Playoffs there. We did a little better planning this time.  
  
  Q. How is the course today? I mean, you kind of got a break, the wind wasn't -- it got up towards the end.   
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Yeah, we had no wind the front, so I hate to say it was easy, but it's easier. On the back it started to pick up.   
 I think it's a good golf course because if you're playing well you can score, but if you're off a little bit, this golf course you can make a double on any hole. I think that's just a sign of a good golf course.   
  
  Q. How long do you think it'll be until you can actually bend down?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: I'm hoping one year.  
  
  Q. A whole year?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Yeah, where it's pain-free.  
  
  Q. A year from --  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: From the surgery, which was about the 1st of September.   
  
  Q. Anything exciting out there today, great save?   
 BRETT QUIGLEY: I got to watch a lot of ospreys. That's about it. There are nests on every hole.   
 It was a good pairing. Bob and Briny and I get along pretty well. We live close to each other, so it was a pretty relaxed day.   
  
  Q. Nice to play 17 with no wind?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Yeah, you know, to me this time of year is a little easier for that tee shot as opposed to March because the prevailing wind is going to have a little bit off the left and maybe will help, as opposed to March when it was in off the right. Not that it's an easy tee shot, but it's a little easier for sure.  
  
  Q. Pitching wedge?  
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Pitching wedge, yeah. There was just a little help from I think 148 or 146.
