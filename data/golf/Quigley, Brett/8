   JOHN BUSH: We'd like to welcome Brett Quigley into the interview room here at the Deutsche Bank Championship. Thanks for coming by and spending a few minutes with us. Brett is currently 90th in FedExCup points standings. You've got a little bit of work to do this week. Just comment on the state of your game. 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: For the state that I'm in, my game is pretty good. For having basically two months off after the U.S. Open, I'm really happy with my game right now and looking forward to this week, so it's pretty interesting in the points system now, so it's definitely created some excitement amongst the players and I know the media, too.
 JOHN BUSH: You're one of the local favorites here obviously, but you've struggled a little bit at this tournament. 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Just because I miss the cut every year here, is that struggling? I think this is the only event I'm 0-for at in my career. I think in the past I've put too much pressure on myself to play well in front of the people at home, and certainly this week I feel like I'm in a great spot mentally, so for me that's a great thing. I really don't have much pressure on me because I really haven't played any golf in six weeks with the exception of last week, so I really don't have much for expectations, so I think that'll help me and certainly work to my advantage. 
 
 Q. You mentioned a minute ago that it created excitement for the players. Do you think that's the right word? I'm not saying it's the wrong word, but what other words would you use? 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Oh, concern (laughing), interest. We talked about it earlier. I think last year they didn't have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough รยก la Rich Beem, and this year it seems like the players think it's a little too much movement. 
 I don't know if it'll be somewhere in the middle there, but certainly they've created some drama and some guys that are certainly going to be thinking about just making the cut this week that guys wouldn't probably be thinking about that normally. 
 
 Q. You mentioned you tended to put a little too much stock in this event because you're the local boy. Can you not put much stock in it this time around, or are you there right now?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Absolutely I'm there right now, probably mainly because my wife is eight days away from our second girl, so I'm kind of -- I've got my phone with me all the time, and I'm just waiting. 
 Yeah, I'm in a great spot. I really have no pressure on myself, like I said, no expectations, and that's a big deal for me.
 
 Q. Patrick is out here, but obviously Brad isn't, Billy isn't. Is it kind of strange to see those two not in a lot of these events like we normally see here?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Absolutely. It just doesn't feel like not to have Brad and Billy here. You know, obviously Brad has been hurt a bunch, and I think Billy has struggled a little bit, too. But yes, it's a strange feeling for me for somebody growing up idolizing those two guys and then spending a lot of time with them on TOUR and not having them here. They're certainly missed. 
 
 Q. I know players are reacting to the points system now, but it's been on the table for months now. How many guys do you think understood the volatility?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Probably less than 25 percent I would say. You know, I don't know if there's right or wrong or what the answer is yet, but none of the guys -- I think 93rd was the last guy out, so certainly none of the guys that are in the Top 30 or Top 70 got knocked out after the first week. If we're talking like a playoff like a football, certainly teams go home every week. So certainly the guys have been protected a little bit, but they've got to play well this week that missed the cut last week. So I kind of like it because everybody else is thinking about what everything else means instead of just playing golf, so that's been some added pressure for everybody, especially with the big payoff at the end.
 
 Q. Kind of twofold here. Would you recommend a change for next year? And if not, and that's okay if it's a no, but if not, what will you have learned about the way it works going into next year? In other words, last year I think we all figured out that you'd better play good to be sure you're seeded high enough to give yourself a good go at it. What have you learned about the system this year?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: I guess the answer to your first question is yes, I would. But Tim asked me two years ago and he didn't listen then, so I don't know why he'd listen now (laughter). 
 As far as what you've learned, I think there has to be a little bit of protection for the guys in the beginning, like the Top 30, the Top 70, because those guys have played well for a long time, and for them to be knocked out the first or second week is pretty tough. 
 But I guess from the TOUR's standpoint, they want playoffs and they want elimination, and certainly it looks like they're getting that. 
 My suggestion would be to have a Top 64 and have a match play tournament. If they want true elimination for the guys, maybe having a playoff three weeks, a seeding, and then having the TOUR Championship be a match play event. For me that would be a perfect scenario as far as you get drama, you have elimination and then you have one winner.
 
 Q. And you don't have to worry about eliminating Tiger because he's not here anyway. 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: I'll play him as a 64 seed (smiling).
 
 Q. What do you plan to do no matter how the rest of your month goes after the baby is born? What's your plan for the fall?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: I'll play a bunch because I skipped a lot this summer. Like I said, I've been out. But I'll probably play five of the events. I mean, I'm looking forward to playing a little golf in the fall and certainly have a chance to play and get back playing. I think I've played 17 or 18 events this year. Normally I'm about 30 so far. So I'm ready to play a little more golf. 
 JOHN BUSH: Brett, play well this week. Thank you.
