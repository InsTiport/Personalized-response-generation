 Q. Great round today?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: Thanks. I played nice and got to watch some really good golf. Charlie played great and kind of carried me around it. Was just easy watching him play.

 Q. You hit ten of 13 fairways today; one of the things you were saying before you teed off was that was a key, to keep it out of the overseeded rough. 
 BRETT QUIGLEY: I drove it nice and just had some chances. A little hiccup on 18, the first putt. The first one I tried to make all week, and with how fast the greens were, I knocked it 20 feet by. I putted nice all week.

 Q. Your dad was following you all week; did he have any advice or does he keep his distance?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: If he ever said anything to me, I would do the exact opposite. (Laughter).
 So that's it as far as any advice he's going to give me.

 Q. How comfortable are you at 7-under par?
 BRETT QUIGLEY: You know, I would like to be 9 where Goosen is, but I played well, and certainly birdieing a couple coming in was nice, 13 and 14. So I played well and had some chances.
