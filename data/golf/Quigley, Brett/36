Q.
Talk about your round.
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Yeah, I feel pretty comfortable here and obviously played pretty good today.  Pretty solid.

Just trying to shoot as low as I could today, because I know tomorrow morning it's going to be cold and nasty.
Q.  A lot of guys on Monday and Tuesday were saying that the course looked like it was going to play hard and the scores wouldn't be that low.  How much difference did the rain make yesterday?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  A huge difference.  The greens are soft, they're very receptive and the fairways are pretty soft.  I think if we had seen firm conditions like Monday, it would have been great.  Because it really would have played a lot more difficult, I believe.  And when you get soft greens, these guys are so good, they shoot low scores.
Q.  You can't win a tournament on Thursday, but you can lose a tournament on Thursday, you didn't do that, you put yourself in contention, so you got to be pleased.
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Yeah, I'm happy.  I've had some good success here.  I feel comfortable on this golf course and certainly many looking forward to the next three days.
