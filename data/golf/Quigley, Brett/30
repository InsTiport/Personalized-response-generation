BRETT QUIGLEY:  Just good pairing today, pretty comfortable.  Luke Donald and Pernice and just putted great, just felt good with the putter all day and rolled it nice.
Q.  Are you going -- (inaudible).
BRETT QUIGLEY:  I don't know.  Keep you guys away from me.
Q.  What was it you said in the first place?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Just felt good with the putter today.  I don't know how many putts I had, but I just rolled it nice.  Looked like every putt I had had a chance to go in, and I've been fighting that the last couple of weeks and today it finally came together.
Q.  Nice being the first one off on a day like this?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Yeah, the greens were flawless.  If you got a putt rolling on line it was going to go in.  It was pretty incredible, actually nice to see.
Q.  How do you keep the momentum going?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  I'm just going to try to catch Luke.  He's got the momentum.  It's nice playing with a guy that's playing well, and we fed off each other.  We kept making birdies and putts, so it was a great day for both of us.
Q.  How is the course playing?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Pretty tough.  It's still pretty soft, the fairways.  I don't think they got out to cut them last night, and as a result there was still a little mud, but the course is in great shape considering all the rain that they had, and hopefully it's going to just keep drying out.
Q.  Do you like being in the first group off, having control of your own tempo?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Yeah, I love it.  I'm a little bit of a quick player anyway, and I like being in that first group off.  Certainly today was just a nice pace all day.  Besides getting up at 4:30, it's nice once you get out there.
