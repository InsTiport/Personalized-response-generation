Q.
Can you talk about your round a little bit
BRETT QUIGLEY:  It went pretty well.  It was a great round.  I made one bad swing on 18, made double there, but overall I think I made seven or eight birdies, so I played great.  I'm certainly pretty happy with the way -- I hit it well.
Q.  The wind was blowing hard early and seemed to die down a little bit later.  Did it help?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  I certainly played better when the wind was blowing hard, so I certainly liked it blowing the front nine and played pretty good.  It definitely died the back nine but kept hitting it solid and making some putts.  I was pleased with today.
Q.  Why do you think you're a good wind player?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  I think I concentrate a little better.  I think the harder the conditions are, it seems like the more -- I have better focus.
Q.  So you prefer the challenge of the elements?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Definitely.  To me the harder the better.  We're supposed to be the best in the world, so we can handle it.
Q.  Greens are fast?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Greens are great.  They're so fast.  It's perfect, perfect speed.
Q.  Were your partner's pink pants a distraction initially?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  No, Hank and I are good friends.  We live about ten minutes apart at home.

I know Henry has struggled this year, so it's good to see him playing well two weeks in a row, and same with Pettersson, so they both made a cut and are moving in the right direction.
Q.  You're down in Florida?
BRETT QUIGLEY:  Yeah, in Jupiter, Palm Beach area.
