 Q.  Bogey-free round.  Three birdies out there.  
JIAYI ZHOU: Yes.   
 Q.  How did you feel about everything today?  
JIAYI ZHOU: Yeah, everything is perfect today.  Every shot on the green and every putt.  I feel so good.   
I still miss some birdies.   
 Q.  This is your rookie season, and I think you played in five events and made the cut once.  
JIAYI ZHOU: Yes.   
 Q.  What's been different out here is far?  You're playing really well.  
JIAYI ZHOU: I just do some change about my short game and (indiscernible) something of my swing, so I feel very comfortable this time.   
The weather is good here and the body control is good and mental control is perfect today.   
 Q.  Is that something you've been working on recently, short game?  
JIAYI ZHOU: Short game, yeah.  I work some.   
 Q.  How long have you guys been working together?  
JIAYI ZHOU: Not so long.  Couple month.
