 Q.  So, Mo, got it to 8-under.  What's been working for you so well this week?  
MO MARTIN: Well, I mean, I love this week in general.  Talked about it a little bit yesterday.  Still feels like a home game to me.  I've got family and friends out.  The course is playing fantastic.  The weather has worked out really well.   
I had a few good putting days coming into this week just practice-wise with my putting coach, Jamie Mulligan.  I think we made some good progress, and it's been showing off so far.   
It's been fun.  Been hitting the ball as well as I have been from last year pretty much.  So hitting it well.  Putting it well.  Chipping it well.  Good combination.   
 Q.  Who all do you have out here following you around this week?  
MO MARTIN: Well, let's see.  My mom, Amanda, who's like a sister to me.  My sister is coming out.  My brother should be out.  Nephew and friends.  I've got my high school best friend is coming out.  Somebody I met in Italy when I studied abroad.  She's coming out with here with her baby.  A lot of people and a lot of new friends, too.  It's been a great week.   
 Q.  How special does it make it that you're up in contention and have everyone coming out to support you?  
MO MARTIN: You know how I feel when my family and friends are out here.  I mean, if the day doesn't go how I want planned, it softens the blow a little bit.   
Then if it goes how I expected or better than I expected then it makes it that much better.  Just makes everything better when you've got family and friends supporting.   
 Q.  Like where you are at the halfway point?  
MO MARTIN: Yeah, I love it.  Played great.  Wouldn't take back any decisions I've made.  I've been able to pretty much execute how I wanted to.  Really happy with it.   
 Q.  Speaking of the decisions, tell me about your decision on 17, about laying up and not going over the water.  
MO MARTIN: Yeah, No. 17 I was on a bit of a downslope.  I could have gotten there yardage-wise, but trajectory with my 3-wood was a little bit lower, and so there was no way I was going for it with a 3-wood.   
So you kind of just have to hope on the layup -- there are a lot of divots there -- so you have to hope you get a good lie.  I only hit a 9-iron to get to (indiscernible) my third shot.   
So hit it down there.  Fortunately drew a good lie and almost holed that one.  It was a nice little birdie putt.   
 Q.  Worked out.  
MO MARTIN: It did.   
 Q.  The Bruins won in the NCAA tournament or you winning your second tournament?  Do we need to even ask the question as to which would be your first choice?  
MO MARTIN: No, don't ask.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Okay.  
MO MARTIN: I would be happy both ways, yes.  Leave it that.  We won't talk about levels of happiness.   
 Q.  Do you have an owl cover on one of your clubs?  
MO MARTIN: An owl, yes, I do.  I've had that for a long time.   
 Q.  We can understand a Bruin.  
MO MARTIN: I have lots of Bruins.   
 Q.  I saw those.  Why an owl?  
MO MARTIN: I met a friend on a cruise ship a long time ago, and his last name is Sowa.  He's Polish, and Sowa vary means owl in Polish.   
So we saw each other again and he brought me an owl.   
 Q.  How long have you had it?  
MO MARTIN: A long time.   
 Q.  Five years?  Ten years?  
MO MARTIN: That's the second replacement.  One of them was lost at the British Open a couple years ago.  But I've had the owl on my bag, gosh, probably for seven years.   
 Q.  Wow.  Talk about the important game, those two birdies after the stumble with the bogey.  
MO MARTIN: Well, yeah, I hit two great shots with those two birdies.  The bogey was -- I had a big ball mark and they get -- these po greens bet super bumpy in the afternoons, and it just stick in the ball mark and went left.   
I mean, I didn't take that too personally.  That happens out here, especially in the afternoon, especially on a Friday after you have the whole field in front of you on the po greens.   
And then, yeah, it was fun to rally and obviously great to finish with a couple birdies.  Yeah, I hit it -- probably only had three feet, three to four feet on 7 there.  Then on 8, I mean, it was within a foot I would say.   
Yeah.
