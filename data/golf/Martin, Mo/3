Q. Good playing.  How does it feel to put yourself in this position?
MO MARTIN: Great.  Happy to be in contention yesterday and happy to be in it again.
Had a really nice pairing with Amy and Mi Hyang, so just pleased with the day.  Still pleased with the way I'm handling this course and managing my game.
Yeah, same thing:  Still playing well, so really glad I'm still feeling well.
One of my best friends came in with his wife last night.  It was nice to have their company as I had breakfast with them, and I am looking forward to the same thing tomorrow.
Q. Yeah.  I think you'll play with Amy again tomorrow.
MO MARTIN: Yeah, looks like this.
Q. What's it been like with her?  What was today's round like and what would it be like to play with her again?
MO MARTIN: She's just been one of those people that's been consistent day in and day out, which is really hard to do when we've got this amount of pressure and this many moving variables every day, from countries to different cities, different food.
But she's just been super consistent, she's been super nice, so we've forged a nice friendship.  We both do the Golf For Africa.  We're both pretty invested in that, so we were chatting about that.
Her brother is super nice.  It was just a great pairing.  Couldn't ask for a better group.
Q. Were you in the final group when you won the British?
MO MARTIN: No.  I was in the final group on Saturday and then I think I was like four or five back.
And then at Woburn a couple years ago I was in the second to last group the last two days and finished second there.  I mean, it's always nice to be in the last group.  We've got great crowds out here rooting us all on, even the Americans.
Q. Do you feel like you have used a lot of clubs in your bag on this course?
MO MARTIN: Yeah, of course.  I have some wedges in, some woods in.  You know, 3-wood in to No. 3.  You know, barely got to the front and just hit two great shots.
I'm really glad they moved the tee box up on 18.  It's a very tough hole, but now it's just a tough hole.  It's not unreasonable right now.  Looking forward to that being a par-5.
Yeah, just it's a testament when there are so many players of different styles in the mix come Sunday.
Q. How challenging is that for you?  Maybe you're not using all the same clubs you would use in the same amount of time.  Make sense?
MO MARTIN: No.
Q. How challenging is it to have to use a lot of different clubs?
MO MARTIN: I mean, that's my game; that's out here.  It's just what I do.  I'm playing my game and, yeah, used to managing golf courses the way I have to.
I'm happy with that.
Q. Any fun plans tonight?
MO MARTIN: No.  Just with my buddies.  We'll have a nice, quiet dinner and be able to catch up with them a little bit.
Q. First time you've seen them in a while?
MO MARTIN: I was at their wedding, so I was his best woman in Prague.  I took a week off.
