Q.   Congratulations, great 3‑under par 69 today.   What really was the key to your round? 
MO MARTIN:   Just a really good plan and I executed it well today.   So this course requires a lot of strategy, I think the layout is phenomenal and the way the officials set it up just complements that.   So I had a good plan with my caddie, Kyle, and we stuck to it and I was able to execute it very well, and then capitalize on some birdies.   So it was good. 

Q.   Everybody's talked about Royal Birkdale being one of the toughest tests they have seen.   What is it about this golf course that you really enjoy? 
MO MARTIN:   It really keeps you in the moment.   So every hole, every shot is its own test.   Like I mentioned before, it's designed so well, and I just think‑‑ you just really have to have so much strategy.   I don't hit a lot of 3‑woods off the tee because I don't hit it very far, and I hit probably four 3‑woods today.   So that just tells you what all is out there. 

Q.   We have seen a lot of different weather conditions.   It seemed to be more mild than we've seen. 
MO MARTIN:   Today the sun came out.   It was a bit chilly this morning and warmed up in a hurry.   It was probably max, the wind, I would say ten to 15 yards, or club, club and a half.   But it was a beautiful day here.

Q.   What do you like about having to think through shots and why putt on 18? 
MO MARTIN:   Well, it keeps you in the moment   and it's a challenge.   It's a fun challenge.   It's new.   We don't get to play courses like this very often, and the British Open is only once a year. 
So it's kind of the epitome of that creativity.   I practised that shot in the practise round.   I hit a couple balls from there and it just rolls out so smoothly here.   Just said, hey, why not, let's have some fun with this.
