Q. Is it just...
MO MARTIN: The putts dropped.  I hit the ball where I wanted to.  I hit a lot of the great shots; hit a lot of great putts.  Didn't have any birdies.  Nothing dropped.  But I couldn't tell you.  I mean...
Q. Your two bogeys at the end the front nine?
MO MARTIN: Uh-huh.
Q. Were they just routine bogeys?
MO MARTIN: Well, the pins are super tough on 8 left and it wasn't a great number for me.  I didn't hit the shot I wanted to and actually kicked into the hazard, so I got up and down for a bogey.  So that was a good bogey.
Then 9 was just, I played the hole well.  It's a really tough hole.  Hit a great bunker shot; misread the putt.
So, I mean, again, I'm doing things well, so...
Q. Yeah.  You've been hearing cheers like on 18 after your putt the whole tournament, I'm assuming.  Has it been like that?
MO MARTIN: Yeah, it's been really nice to have a contingent out there.  The Mo Squad is in full force.
Q. Did you point to someone in particular?
MO MARTIN: Terry Duffy.
Q. Really?  (Laughter.)
MO MARTIN: Yeah.  I knew he would be out there looking at me.  He was up there with a big smile.  Just pointing at him.
Q. Did you have that in the back of your head before you hit the putt?
MO MARTIN: No.  I mean, I know he's up there, but I'm not thinking about him in particular when I'm stroking it.  It's just great to have his support.
It's good to be playing well.  Good way it end the season.  Win, win, win.
Q. What do you think it's going to take tomorrow?
MO MARTIN: I don't know.  I mean, everybody is going to be going for it.  There is a lot on the line for a lot of people.  They're going to bring their best.
I'm just going to have to play great from start to finish.  If I play the way I know I can, we'll see how it stands at the end.
Q. Last question:  The birdie stretch you had, have you ever had that before?  Trying to recollect.  And you may not remember many.  Do you remember a stretch like that?
MO MARTIN: It's my lowest nine for sure.
Q. Okay.  Yeah.
MO MARTIN: I mean, 6-under for nine?
Q. Yeah.
MO MARTIN: Yeah, that's my lowest.
