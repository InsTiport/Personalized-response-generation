 Q.  5-under 66, this course sets up pretty well for you, doesn't it?  
MO MARTIN: Yeah, apparently.  I'm happy with the start.  It's a good way to come out, a very simple day, steady round, and I putted really well, hit the ball well.  The Cubs won today, so my caddie was happy.   
 Q.  You need to keep it on the fairways, that's obviously a strength of yours.  Is that just what you need to do on this golf course, just keep it on the short stuff?  
MO MARTIN: I think any golf course, yes.  But the greens, they have a lot of grain on them, so they can get a little bit tricky, but I had a great day reading them.  Had good company with Jodi and Elena, and Joe is always a comedian out there.  It was a nice day, easy.  Simple day.   
 Q.  Tell us about how you chose your schedule, because you took a break in the middle of the six-week swing.  How did you come about that decision?  
MO MARTIN: It was really hard to choose which tournaments to play in, because we've got great events on the schedule now.   
So it was very difficult.  Waited till late.  But I played five in a row in Asia last year and I was pretty tired.  My body was a little bit beat up.  So I decided to take a week off and I went back to the States last week just for a little R&R and it looks like it was a good decision.
