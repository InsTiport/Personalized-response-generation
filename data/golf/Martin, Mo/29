Q.   Another solid day. 
MO MARTIN:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   Just feeling good about the round overall?
MO MARTIN:   Yeah, I left a few more birdie putts out there than I did yesterday.   Hit a few edges and maybe misread a few.
Still solid round. 

Q.   Are you suddenly a rock star out here? 
MO MARTIN:   Nope.   Nothing has changed.   Signed a few more autographs.

Q.   You're not hearing, Hey, that's Mo Martin?
MO MARTIN:   Yeah, I am.   Somebody yelled, You're the queen on the green.   That was a first.   (Laughing.) 

Q.   I like that. 
MO MARTIN:   Made me laugh.

Q.   So people are recognizing you a little bit more?
MO MARTIN:   Yeah, more. 

Q.   Getting caught up on sleep a little bit?
MO MARTIN:   A little bit.   Yesterday about 8:00 I was‑‑

Q.   ‑‑ shut everything down?
MO MARTIN:   Yeah.   It's catching up with me a little bit.

Q.   Not only on the golf course, but are people recognizing you in town?
MO MARTIN:   I'm not sure.   At the airport coming here after the British a couple people were looking at me and staring at me, but I didn't know if that was because I looked ridiculous with my luggage.   I didn't stop to find out.

Q.   Did you fly into Detroit?
MO MARTIN:   Yeah, eventually.   I connected through Toronto.

Q.   Heading into the weekend?
MO MARTIN:   Just continue with my game plan and hopefully make a few more putts this weekend.

Q.   Anything that gave you some trouble today that you need to work on?
MO MARTIN:   No.   I just left a few birdie putts out there.   Couple of them were misreads, so just be a little more careful with that.

Q.   How is it playing with So Yeon and Michelle?   Feel good?   Nervous? 
MO MARTIN:   They're great to play with. 

Q.   Yeah. 
MO MARTIN:   I mean, they're both super nice.   It was kind of fun to have the US Open winner and the British Open winner.   Our games are different.   She's got a lot more length off the tee.   I'm sure that was fun for the gallery, too.
Great to play with.   I really enjoyed it.
