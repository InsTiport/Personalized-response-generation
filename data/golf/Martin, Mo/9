Q. 4-under, 10-under overall heading into the final day.  How does it feel and what was working well for you today?
MO MARTIN: I had another solid front and then a hot back nine, so that's a good combination here.  Yeah, pretty much just continuing the momentum from the last couple days.  Like I said yesterday, just good to have things come together.  I know I've been playing well.  So I'm going to ride this and continue to have a good plan and execute.
Q. What is that plan heading into tomorrow?
MO MARTIN: It's just course management.  It's just doing your work, doing your homework before and knowing how to play the course once the tournament comes and adjusting to anything that changes.  Today was really nice to play with In gee.  She's obviously a fantastic golfer, and she's a fantastic person as well and a great competitor.  I had a good time with her.  The time went fast.  I ran into a couple critters out there and it was entertaining.
Q. What were they?
MO MARTIN: We couldn't figure one out, but I wanted to take it home.  It was either a mole or a mouse or rat.  Its eyes were barely open.  But it was moving right in front of her when she was swinging, and they both admired it for a little bit.  I kind of wanted to take it back, but Craig had to talk me out of it.  I also have to say a huge thanks to Craig.  He's been a great friend of me since he's been on my bag the last two years.  He's a great caddie, and he's been the reason I've had a couple good years.
Q. In your practice rounds this week seeing the golf course, did it look like a golf course that would fit you well just because you're very accurate and it might penalize some of the other players?
MO MARTIN: Yeah, right away it was pretty obvious it was going to play like an Open.  It's thick grass, and it's got a big soaking on Monday from the rain.  So that made it even thicker.  There are still some puddles out there, but it's just in great shape.  The greens are super fast, and some very tricky pin placements out there.  So they're tricking it up like an open too.
Q. The wrap on your hand, is that new or is that something you've had all week?
MO MARTIN: No, not all week.  I haven't actually haven't hit a ball without this for a couple years.  I injured this after the British Open, and I had an amazing hand therapist that got me through it, Mo Herrmann who is down in the L.A. area.  We devised a splint that would give me enough support in this joint here and I was able to change my group.  Now with the sprint, I'm still able to play.
Q. So a couple of years.  It's not new.
MO MARTIN: It's not new.
Q. It's just something you know you deal with.
MO MARTIN: Yeah, it's necessary.
Q. It looks like tomorrow you're going to be playing with Nicole Broch Larsen who is a very long player.  Is that an issue for you as far as watching someone who hits it past you a long ways?
MO MARTIN: No, I've always been on the small side.  My dad two tease me and call me Mighty Mouse when I was younger.  So, look, I love this game.  It's the greatest game on the planet.  And one of the reasons is you can play it so many ways and it's all inclusive.  So different ages, obviously, genders and sizes, and you can play this game anyway.  You just have to own your strength.  So I haven't played with her yet.  She's been nice to me in passing, so I look forward to meeting her.  Am I with In-Gee again?  I'm not sure.  But I'll look forward to whoever I'm playing with.  It's a great time to be on the LPGA.
Q. Brooke Henderson set a course record this morning.  Did that tell you that the course was gettable today?
MO MARTIN: I well, I heard the roars when I was warming up.  I figured it had something to do with Brooke.  Somebody said she shot, what, eight under?
Q. Yeah.
MO MARTIN: That's always inspiring to hear that.  It raises the bar.  I think that just goes to show where we are as a Tour right now.  The bar is continuously being raised.  I'm glad to be here, glad to be a part of it, and glad to be in the hunt.
Q. The press corps all night or all last night and today was talking about the pizza party you guys had.  We all ate pizza as well, so we're curious to know what kind of pizza did you have, and how was the party?
MO MARTIN: Those are secrets ( laughing).  Brittany Lincicome's caddie, Missy is famous for making pizzas.  I don't know if I'm giving away her secrets or not.  But she made individual pizzas, so at everyone's request, there were at least 10 of us over there last night.  They're actually staying above us, so it's kind of a nice little gathering we have.  I gave her pizzas an A-plus.  I had pepperoni and mushroom, if you're curious.
Q. We are curious.  Because Brittany tells us how she has an off beat with a mascarpone sweet cream?
MO MARTIN: Oh, yeah.
Q. So we did want to know.  I wanted to know?
MO MARTIN: No two pizzas were the same last night.  Everybody mixed it up.
Q. So do you think the pizza helped today, hindered?
MO MARTIN: It definitely helped.  I felt good when I woke up.  Felt good going to bed.  I don't eat a lot of pizza, but I'll take Missy's any day when I do eat it.
Q. I wanted to ask you, you said your dad called you Mighty Mouse.  What is his name?
MO MARTIN: Allen.  He passed away when I was in college.  Wish he was around to hear me tease him too ( laughing).
Q. You were saying the golf course is playing like a major set up.  Is there any particular holes you're finding extra challenging this week?
MO MARTIN: No, they all have their challenges.  There's no really easy hole out there.  There is nothing you can take for granted.  That's a sign of the Open, you know?  Any open.  You've got to be on your game every hole.  So, yeah, it's a great set-up.  It's beautiful.  We've had great weather.  The fans are really supportive.  A lot of well-wishes even starting from the first tee, so it's very nice.
Q. Did you find the greens any firmer today than yesterday, or were they pretty similar?
MO MARTIN: Pretty similar.
