 Q.   Birdie on 18.   Very key.   Good way to finish your round.   Talk about that.   
MO MARTIN:   It was a very steady round.   Four birdies.   All the rest pars.   I had fun playing with Michelle and So Yeon.   It was a beautiful day and it was a great round of golf today.  
   
 Q.   How happy are you to come back from the British ‑ clearly doesn't seem to be much jet lag ‑ and fire a good round?   
MO MARTIN:   I'm pretty tired and still kind of feels like a dream.   I was joking around with the trainers saying, Can you massage here because my face hurts a little bit from smiling.  
So still kind of surreal.   But I was able to focus on my round today.   Proud of that.   Had a good time today.   
   
 Q.   Yeah, take me through that.   The grogginess and coming out here and posting a good first‑round score.   
MO MARTIN:   Yeah, definitely.   I mean, a lot of people said they were surprised I didn't take the week off, so then that put did my head that should I be taking the week off?   I'm tired enough where that would've been nice.  
I love this tournament and I love this community.   It was a plan to play, so just following through with that.
