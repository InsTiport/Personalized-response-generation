Q. I think 4-under par is quite a great start to the week?
MO MARTIN: I'm happy with it.
Q. How does it feel to be back at this championship injury-free?
MO MARTIN: I'm always so happy to be back here.  Clearly a lot of good memories.  Got a text from my mom this morning saying she polished my trophy and she was thinking good thoughts.  I thought that was really sweet.  Really nice to be back.  I love the way that the LGU sets up the golf course.  I think they do a really good job of keeping it challenging, but fair.
And we had in the morning, it was really nice weather.  I thought the rain was going to come in a little bit more than it did.  Sprinkled on us for two or three holes but wasn't bad.
So I think I'm happy to get away with just a little bit of rain this afternoon.  But yeah, good golf course, a departure from typical links-style, but we are still here in England.  Good memories.
Q. Four birdies and no dropped shots.
MO MARTIN: No bogeys.
Q. What was the sort of secret to success?
MO MARTIN: Yeah, I hit it really well.  I spent the last couple months with Jamie mulligan down in Long Beach working on my putting.  I've known him for a long time now, and so I think we're starting to make some breakthroughs with my putting.  I just think it's been a real consistent year ball-striking.  I had to change my grip after I was injured a couple years ago.  Shortened my thumb.
Q. Changing up on the swing?
MO MARTIN: On the swing.  After I did that, I got into a really good rhythm of ball-striking, and then I just think now, I think putting is coming together, because still I changed the short putter three, 3 1/2 years ago.  So I'm still hammering out all the details.  But I think once I get it done, I think I'll be an even better putter than I was before.
Q. You touched on it, saying how special a championship it is how; how does it feel not to be at a links course and at Woburn, tree-lined?
MO MARTIN: I talked to Charley about it, Charley's home course from what I understand.  Charley's been really friendly, she's great.  She said it's definitely an American-style course, and that's all I heard coming over here.  I was a little bit disappointed to hear that in the beginning, just because I love the creativity that links brings out.  I love the challenge of that specifically.
But I really like the golf course.  I can't say a bad thing about it.  I think it's really pretty.  Parts of it remind me of the Pacific Northwest.  But then you have some of the bunkering that reminds me of links, too.  So it's definitely a departure from links, but I'm really enjoying it.  I think it's a great golf course and I think it was a good choice to hold it here.
