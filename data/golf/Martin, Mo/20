 Q.  How cool is it to see out of a tournament like this, all the fans for the players and support?  
MO MARTIN: It's great.  It's been two weeks now in a row and there's just been a see of red, and I think this year more than others, everybody's gotten the memo and been on board ask been supportive of the cause, heart healthy day.  I think that's something we should all get behind.  But no, I think I mean even you look at my friends, three out of four have got red on.  And the caddies, players, so literally it was a sea of red.  We all had red uniforms on today.  So really neat to see.  It's nice to see a community support an event like this, and it's nice to see everybody get involved to raise awareness.   
 Q.  Does it have any personal meaning to you today or is it just playing for the cause?  
MO MARTIN: No.  I mean hearts, we've all got hearts.  My dad died of a heart attack when I was pretty young.  Grandma died of a heart attack.  So I think it's a great combination, because what we do is a really healthy lifestyle, getting out walking.  We're walking an average of six miles a day at least.  So I think it's a great combination.  But yeah, I think it hits home.  I think anybody out here could tell you that it would hit home for them.
