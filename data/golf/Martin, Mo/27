 Q.   How's it feel?  
MO MARTIN:   It's tender.   I can't wait to take this off, and I've never played with anything on my fingers, and I've never had a sprain in a finger, so this is new for me.   
I'm hoping I'm going to recover quickly, but it's still painful right now.   I just want to minimize the risk of injuring it further.  
   
 Q.   Bit of an up‑and‑down first round, but still solid score.   
MO MARTIN:   Yeah, I'm happy with it.   It was the first time‑‑ well, I hit some shots in the pro am, but first time I hit a lot of shots out there, so just learning how this course reacts, where to land my shots and where the prevailing winds are, so just a lot to learn the subtleties here, but I'm happy with the way I played.  
   
 Q.   And we talked a bit beforehand about long hitter's course, long hitter's course.   Did you feel that to be the case today?  
MO MARTIN:   You know, I saw Lexi up there, so I'm sure she made some birdies; and I don't know, she probably didn't have a 3‑wood coming into 18.   But that played quite long, and the wind just got up here, so some of these long par‑4s into the wind, they're definitely playing long.
