Q.  Girls, congratulations.  Fantastic stuff out there.  Iben, could you tell me how you felt over that putt?

IBEN TINNING:  I just said to myself, "It's going to go in".  I was so confident that this one is going to go in. 


Q.  You made a couple of long putts today, didn't you.  At some stage it's a little  --

IBEN TINNING:   I had one long one, to be fair.


Q.  Otherwise you seemed to be struggling with the putting a little bit?

IBEN TINNING:   I would say so, but I've been like that all my golf career.  So it's not really a shock for me. 


Q.  Elisabeth, another great performance by you.  You really seem to be enjoying this week?

ELISABETH ESTERL:   We had so much fun out there.  It was really great playing with Iben.  We said we were enjoying the gallery, whatever comes out.  Of course we are not here to lose.  If it goes their way, it goes their way.  We're having a good time.  As I said to you on the last, there's no pressure.  We played so well.  It worked out great.  Our match was even all the way.  They were good.  We were good.  So it balanced it out right.  And that's the right result for that match, I think.
