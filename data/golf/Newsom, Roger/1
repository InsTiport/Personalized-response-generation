 Q.  Obviously it's emotional when you come so close.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah, just wasn't enough. Hit a bad shot out there; hit a good drive and then just didn't---   
 Q.  What did you hit from the fairway there?  
ROGER NEWSOM: 5-iron.   
 Q.  From?  
ROGER NEWSOM: From 195 yards.   
 Q.  Just caught it a little --  
ROGER NEWSOM: Caught it heavy.   
 Q.  Yeah. Obviously you came back. You were down, and that's been your motif all week, never quit.  
ROGER NEWSOM: It was a good match. Back and forth, back and forth; I kind of gave too many today. I gave more than what I had given away the first matches.   
 Q.  Yeah. I mean, because he didn't make a birdie all day. You had two birdies.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Anything particular about today that you thought was the difference?  
ROGER NEWSOM: No, just my rhythm. I guess I didn't seem to have the -- you know, I hadn't had a fat shot like that the whole time. Where that came from, I don't know. I guess it's just nerves.   
 Q.  What do you take from this week? You get to a final, and what do you think you learn going forward and playing in these events going forward?  
ROGER NEWSOM: I think I trust my golf game more. The more you play in these things and you do okay, you just build trust in your game.   
 Q.  Right.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Did you hear from Pat?  
ROGER NEWSOM: No, I haven't heard from Pat yet.   
 Q.  Well, he lost the final in 2010 and came back and won in 2014. Maybe you can follow that path. These things are not easy to get to.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Maybe. Yeah, I know. Yeah, how many timings you get through all these guys? We'll see.   
 Q.  Will you play the Mid-Am in a couple weeks?  
ROGER NEWSOM: I don't know. I've got to look at what I'm invited to and what my surgical schedule -- I don't know yet.   
 Q.  Obviously you're in the Senior Open next year.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah.   
 Q.  In this for another three years.  
ROGER NEWSOM: I am?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ROGER NEWSOM: I've got to find the website to find out where I'm --   
 Q.  Yeah, three-year exemption for the runner-up, and get into the Amateur next year at Bandon Dunes and the Senior Open next year.  
ROGER NEWSOM: U.S. Amateur?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ROGER NEWSOM: That's pretty nice.   
 Q.  Yeah. Ever played in the Am?  
ROGER NEWSOM: No, I never played in the U.S. Am.   
 Q.  It's at Bandon Dunes. Ever been to Bandon Dunes?  
ROGER NEWSOM: I played in the Mid-Am at Bandon Dunes, so I made the match play.   
 Q.  Same courses.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah, yeah. So I love that place.   
 Q.  You have a lot of patients following you this week?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Well, I've had some calls, so I think they're following me.   
 Q.  Waiting for you to get back to look at their eyes.  
ROGER NEWSOM: I'm going to work tomorrow.   
 Q.  I guess your old coach was here.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah, yeah, Jerry Lake. (Phonetic)   
 Q.  You guys keep in contact?  
ROGER NEWSOM: On and off.   
 Q.  How special was that to have that?  
ROGER NEWSOM: It's pretty nice; nice to have. I had a friend from Pine Valley, Charlie McDowell, who was the '61 Junior champion. He beat Jay Sigel. He drove all the way down from Wilmington, Delaware to watch today.   
 Q.  McDowell?  
ROGER NEWSOM: And several friends come down from Tidewater, so, yeah.   
 Q.  Are you good friends with Charlie?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Oh, yeah, yeah.   
 Q.  Congratulations, Roger. Nice playing. See you down the line.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Thank you.
