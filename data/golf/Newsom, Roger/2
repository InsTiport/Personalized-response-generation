 Q.  Congratulations on getting to the finals. This is obviously your first final.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Hell of shot there on 18; what did you have?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: We had 170.   
ROGER NEWSOM: 170, and I hit a 9-iron going downhill a little bit. I knew if I hit too much club it's going to be on the back of the green. I just had to hit it really well, and I hit the lesser club and it hit on the front of the green and worked out.   
 Q.  Sidehill lie a little bit?  
ROGER NEWSOM: A little bit sidehill lie.   
 Q.  In the rough?  
ROGER NEWSOM: In the rough, but it was sitting up. I was fortunate.   
 Q.  Now you came back in this match. You were down a little bit.  
ROGER NEWSOM: My friend Pat Tallent, who won this, said, Don't quit. Go to the end. You never know. That's what happened today, you know. Rick is a good player and I just eked it out; we were both leaking oil a little bit coming in.   
I got it done.   
 Q.  Got it done this morning, too. 20 holes.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Gave away this hole in the morning.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah.   
 Q.  Was that on your mind?  
ROGER NEWSOM: No, no. It didn't even remind me. I was just thinking about the shot that I had to hit.   
 Q.  You get a lot of perks for getting to the finals.  
ROGER NEWSOM: I do? I don't even know.   
 Q.  You get into next month's Mid-Am; the U.S. Am next year; U.S. Senior Open next year.  
ROGER NEWSOM: I'll have to find out what I'm in.   
 Q.  And at least three senior amateurs. If you win you obviously get ten, but...  
ROGER NEWSOM: Well, I'm playing to win this.   
 Q.  I understand that.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Honestly, I don't care about all that. I want to win this. If I'm taking off from work and my patients are paying the price, I'm playing to win.   
 Q.  Obviously had to skip some patient time this week.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah.   
 Q.  You have any surgeries scheduled?  
ROGER NEWSOM: I had to cancel surgeries.   
 Q.  Like each day?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Well, I had surgery scheduled for this week and the patients, it got canceled.   
 Q.  Okay. What does it mean for you to get to a final?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Oh, I mean, I guess for me, being older, it's a pretty meaningful thing because I know people who have won USGA events and I know the significance of it.   
Yeah, I would like to be up there with them.   
 Q.  On the 20th hole, or the 19th hole this morning, was it a big key shot at all or...  
ROGER NEWSOM: No, no. I hit a sand wedge up there about ten feet and he three-putted. I three-putted a couple times to today and gave some holes away.   
I was able to come back and get it done.   
 Q.  Some fun questions here. College, East Carolina; what year did you graduated?  
ROGER NEWSOM: '86.   
 Q.  And obviously you're an eye doctor.  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yep.   
 Q.  Lowest competitive score?  
ROGER NEWSOM: 62 in the Eastern Amateur the year I won it in 2012.   
 Q.  Where?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Elizabeth Manor Golf and --   
 Q.  Where?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Elizabeth Manor.   
 Q.  Is that in North Carolina?  
ROGER NEWSOM: No, it's up in Virginia. Vinny Giles won it; Ben Crenshaw won it; Andy Bean, all the big guys.   
 Q.  Holes in one?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Holes in one five, but here is the interesting thing. You know anybody who won a car off a hole in one? I won a car last year. Alfa Romeo.   
 Q.  Really?  
ROGER NEWSOM: I still can't sell it. You want to buy?   
 Q.  No, I can't afford it. Tell the USGA to give me a raise.  
ROGER NEWSOM: I hit a 4-iron and won an Alpha Romeo. My wife is like, Get rid of that thing.   
 Q.  Favorite club in the bag?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Favorite club is probably my 7-iron.   
 Q.  Favorite course?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Favorite course is Pine Valley.   
 Q.  Favorite pro sports team?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Favorite pro sports team, Red Skins, but they make me mad.   
 Q.  One of my colleagues will agree with you. Favorite golfer?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Favorite golfer, I must say Steve Stricker. He carries himself so well and he beat my brains in the U.S. Senior.   
 Q.  Dream foursome?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Jack Nicklaus, my brother --

 Q.  Favorite hobby away from golf?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Working in the yard, gardening.   
 Q.  If there is one shot from the week that was the key shot this week...  
ROGER NEWSOM: Oh, it was yesterday, and I hit it over 15 on the second shot in the morning against Jerry, and I flopped a sand wedge and hit it up like this.   
 Q.  15 in the round of 32?  
ROGER NEWSOM: Yeah. Hit it like that and it's like one of the greatest shots I've ever hit in my life.   
 Q.  Sand wedge and 60 degree?  
ROGER NEWSOM: No, no, 58. But that shot wasn't bad.   
 Q.  No, it wasn't.
