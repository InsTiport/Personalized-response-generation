DOTTIE PEPPER:   Score card, really boring.  The first birdie at 7.  I had a 5-iron in there to eight feet.  Birdied 9 for the second day in a row.  Had 8-iron to about 15 feet there.  And bogeyed the par -3 12.  Was short left of the bunker, that really kept me  -- it was a very difficult day, we actually had three switches in weather.  Oh, we had it all, really.  We had the muggy, humid; going nowhere, going from out of the west, back out of the east, back out of the north.  17 when we went through, it was unreachable.  Yeah, I hit a 3-wood.  And Leta hit the same thing.  Unbelievable.  It was one of those wild days where nothing felt great.  Nothing really looked good in the air.  Just one of those days -- (inaudible) figure that out after a while.  But you just have to get through it and go to the range for a little bit and forget about it and go home and tee it up tomorrow  -- in the golf tournament and tied for the lead.  So that was all a bonus. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

DOTTIE PEPPER:   Not a whole lot.  I had it going right and left, I had it going  -- just enough for me to take care of.  I didn't pay attention to a whole lot.  I didn't hear a whole lot of yelling.  So with that in mind, you know you're not too far out of anywhere. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

DOTTIE PEPPER:   Well, you know, I think the bottom line every week, and this is true  -- you have to beat the golf course and not beat yourself.  I think that's the other aspect.  But, certainly, I mean, you expect players of a caliber in this field to be knocking on the door.  You know, players that have dominated all year, you expect them to be at the top of the leaderboard.  So you know you're going to have to play your best golf to get the job done.  And we've got a great leaderboard.  I think Juli went out and played a great round and got herself right back in there.  And we've got 36 holes to figure out who is going to take home the trophy.  It might be sooner than the presidential election is decided.  I don't know, I think you're right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  (Laughter.)

Q.  (Inaudible.)

DOTTIE PEPPER:   Well, you know, it's out there and I don't think you can trust the issue  -- I know I left a really low one out there yesterday.  That was a really solid round of golf.  It good been quite a bit lower.  Today, I got a lot out of my round.  Over four days you usually figure you are going to have one or all of them.  Hopefully, tomorrow will be the day that everything all falls together. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

DOTTIE PEPPER:   Partly because a lot of it is not there, because they are so young.  You think you always know where left is, but sometimes people talking about  -- being indicative of where the green is than truly running toward the left.  So you have a little bit more to think about rather than just standing in there and thinking, "Left, okay.  I know the green is going that way, and also, not being around this golf course.  We each of -- us only have a few competitive rounds of us on this golf course.  You're still learning the nuances.  I think that's probably more so  -- yeah.  If you can find Tampa, it's probably going that way. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

DOTTIE PEPPER:   I voted  absentee, Palm Beach County.  The ultimate combination.   Waiting for what?  No, mine was in -- mine was in about 10 days before the election.  It was more confusing to vote absentee, because you didn't have anywhere to put the ballot.  It didn't lay open  -- you had your ballot here on the right and the instructions, and your choices on another piece of paper.  So you had to  -- okay, Bush and Cheney and then you had to go find one on the entire punch card.  You just didn't have to go straight across.  You had to go literally punch it on the punch card.  It  wasn't like you could slide it into the metal part of the ballot.  My opinion, it probably is too strong, but if you can't figure out where the arrows are pointing, you probably shouldn't be voting.  (Laughs).  Yeah, that's right.  What do I think should happen.   I think they should abide by the law.  I think it's there for a reason and fortunately, (inaudible) is trying to putt the legalese over the law. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

DOTTIE PEPPER:   Is that right?  They have to wait for what, next year?  2004?  It could end up pretty close.  It very well could, and it's not even a Federal issue.  Yeah, exactly.  Some great social studies I think when you learn the Constitution.  It may have worked -- inaudible-- five ballots at the same time, too.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Leaderboard  -- everybody is in too close of proximity, you definitely still have to play the golf course.

Q.  (Inaudible?

DOTTIE PEPPER:  New driver that's not on the market yet.  So (inaudible) just some people that haven't been comfortable with it.  Karrie hits the ball fairly high, and this ball's launch angle is a little steep for her.  It may not be a great fit.  For me it would be a really good fit.  (Inaudible.) Not out yet, either.  Shaped like a much more traditional  -- nine days, yeah. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

DOTTIE PEPPER:   Yeah, there's been some, but I think everybody is just amazed that all  -- become a lot of conversation where he typically is not.  You have people -- inaudible -- Meg and I noticed walking in the locker room some of the people that were standing outside were talking about.  So I think that's the amazing part of all of it.  No. No.  I think if I had to guess, I think  -- I have yet to talked to anybody who voted for Gore, but I'm sure there are some, but of the people I've talked to  -- maybe there are.
