Q.  Dottie, we talked about how you just drive on this competition.

DOTTIE PEPPER:  I left her hanging coming in. I left her hanging at 16.  I just needed to get that ball in the middle of the green and let her take a rip at that pin and I hit a terrible shot at 17.  But I was there.  I was there at 18.  Not sure she needed me because she had it well in hand.


Q.  You guys have got a great big lead?

DOTTIE PEPPER:  Well, it's early.  The important thing is we need to play even better tomorrow and, certainly, I think we know we can't rest on our laurels.  We'll be hungry tomorrow.


Q.  Congratulations.  Out there today, emotionally draining?

BRANDIE BURTON:  Yes, it was.  I played well along with Meg and paired with Dottie in the afternoon.  She played incredible.  I didn't play so hot, but when it came down to crunch time, I kind of came through for her a couple of times.  But, yeah, it was a long day and we're glad to be ahead, but we've still got a lot of work ahead of us.


Q.  How grinding is it out there?

BRANDIE BURTON:  It's pretty grinding.  These greens are really firm, so the club selection is very difficult and when you're really not on top of your iron game, you're going to have some very interesting shots out there.
