 Q.  Ollie, 69 today.  You shot 66 yesterday.  You pointed to the double bogey.  That was the only difference.  OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: I hit it great.  One bad swing there, little bit mentally not ready for the shot and cost me two.   Q.  What's the condition of the golf course out there?  The players have been saying the greens are fantastic.  OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: The greens are great.  They're a little soft, spike marks get going there a little later in the day.  Had some putts that might have kind of wavered on line because of the spike marks.  They're really terrific.   Q.  Let's take a look at the summer you had.  You played at Valspar as an amateur, U.S. Open as an amateur, The Open Championship you played fantastic.  This is the second tournament.  What's the difference between amateur golf and professional golf?  OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: Now it's all I have to do.  I don't have school anymore and all the other stuff.  I'm freed up to do, you know, no more amateur rules, NCAA rules.  Still just competing and trying to get the best score I can.   Q.  Part of that high school class of 2011 where you, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, all these young players came out and feel like you come out and play golf and just freewheel it.   Is it a mindset, Junior Golf that prepared you for this?  What is it?  OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: It's a way of kind of how you go about your business.  You have to almost just have a belief that everything is going to be good and that you're doing right things and you kind of let things happen.  I think it's the only way to do it, really.   Q.  7-under in your second PGA TOUR event.  That's got to be fun.  Keep playing well for the rest of the week.  OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: Thank you
