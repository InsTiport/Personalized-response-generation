 Q.  Basically tell me about your round.  How do you feel about it?  Some key shots for you that helped you get that 72?  OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: Well, I played really well to start, but I wasn't able to capitalize.  I had a couple of three-putts and I played hole 6 poorly.  But I was able to hang in there again today.  I got off to a bad start yesterday.  But I know if I keep playing as well as I am, I will have chances. I hung in there and made great birdies on 7 and 8 to get back into decent shape.  I made a careless bogey on 12, but I lung in there and made some great par saves, made a great par save on 13 and birdied 14 again today, which is a difficult hole.  Almost birdied 15 and hit a great one on 16 and made birdie and almost birdied the last two as well.  I just hung in there and kept playing well.   Q.  So you came into today with the longest driving average of all the players.  Do you feel like this course sets up well for your game in terms of that length?  OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: I think so.  Certainly on some holes it's a massive advantage for me.  But you do have to hit the fairway as well.  I have been able to hit the fairway a lot for me this week that's given me a lot of good chances.   Q.  In terms of your amateur status, and right now you are tied for best amateur score, did you have any inclination?  Was that what you were shooting for or was it just come here and do the best I can kind of thing?  OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: Come here and do the best I can.
