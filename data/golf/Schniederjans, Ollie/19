Q. Basically your thoughts on your round today?OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: I thought it was good.  It was a lot of fun and beyond my expectations for a Thursday, as far as excitement.  And the atmosphere is amazing.  I felt very comfortable with my game and just myself out there, so I was pretty pleased with it.  And I feel like I could -- left some shots out there and I could do even better tomorrow and it was a lot of fun.Q. Tell me what you thought about the layout of the course and the challenge.OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: It's very difficult.  It's very mentally draining.  You've got to pay attention to every single shot you hit.  The greens are scary.  Some of these fast putts.  You don't want to hit it three feet by and have a three-footer coming back.  I got a little tentative on some of them.  I think everyone is going to miss some of those.  It's just the mature of it.  I thought it was set up really well.Q. And final question, just how many practice rounds did you have out here?OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: I played 36 holes total.
