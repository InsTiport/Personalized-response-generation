 Q.  Nice little birdie at the last.  Just some opening thoughts on your round.  
OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: Felt a little rusty but putted really nice.  That was really where I scored was I saved myself with the putter today.  I've been -- I feel really good about my game.  I just had a double from a fairway bunker, and I was in it and thought about it, and it was the first fairway bunker shot I've had in like two months.  A little rusty from the off-season, but putted really good.  And good to get the first round of 2018 in the books.  Definitely pleased with the score overall.   
 Q.  Is there a part of your game that felt more rusty than others, other than fairway bunker shots?  
OLLIE SCHNIEDERJANS: Really just like being in the tournament, going at tough pins and stuff.  I played a little bit in the off-season, but you're not playing with pins three steps from the left hardly when you're home.  So just really, really probably a couple times just had trouble with my alignment out there and then a couple times like some tough pins where I was a little uncomfortable, just kind of getting back in the groove of returning to golf.
