 Q.   What are your thoughts on the week and how it's panned out?   
ANGELO QUE:   Actually panned out better than I thought.   I had a chance to win, yeah, I did, but I didn't win, so just move on.   That's how it is.   There's only one winner.   Unfortunately I bogeyed the last.   I think I hit the shot of my life on the last hole, so I can't complain.   
   
 Q.   I was going to ask you about the 9‑iron, that was magnificent, wasn't it.   
ANGELO QUE:   I hit a lot of great shots today.   I almost holed my tee shot on 1.   I holed a lot of putts today, and you know, I was hoping for another one on the last hole but unfortunately it fell a few yards short.   But you know, I finished second.   My target this week was just to finish Top‑5, Top‑10.   I finished second and had a chance to win.   I'm very happy.   
   
 Q.   Lovely spirit about that playoff, you and Hend just walking down the fairway together.   
ANGELO QUE:   Yeah, I'm like that.   We're all trying to make money out here, trying to win.   I mean, we can all be friends.   We can't be enemies.   We are doing the same thing every week.   We just have to be friends.   We just have to be nice to each other.  
   
 Q.   Do you appreciate how close you came with the approach in the playoff?   
ANGELO QUE:   Yeah, I trusted the shot.   I trusted‑‑ I didn't have second thoughts on any of my shots today.   So I'm very happy with my performance and I'm going to take it with me next week.  
   
 Q.   Going to Macau?  
ANGELO QUE:   Yes, Macau.   I think I'm going to have two days rest I think and also I think I might have gotten into the CIMB, so looks like it's going to be a busy two more weeks.
