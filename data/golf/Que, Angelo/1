 Q.   I suppose that's a decent start.   
    ANGELO QUE:   Yeah, I'm pretty happy with my start.   Shooting under par any tournament is always good.   My target was just to shoot 1‑ or 2‑under, which I did, although I missed a couple of short putts, but I was hitting the ball very solid.   I only missed one fairway, didn't hole the putts that I hoped to hole today, but all in all, still very happy.   2‑under, it's getting windy now, so this course might not be that good if the wind picks up and pins are not really that easy.   You've got to really hit good shots in in order to hit it close, so I'm very happy.  
   
 Q.   I suppose the key here is hitting the fairways and playing a good second shot into the greens?  
    ANGELO QUE:   Yeah, which I pretty much did today.   I only missed one fairway.   I hit every fairway, and so I had a chance to attack the pin pretty much every hole.   You know, that helps, so hopefully tomorrow or until the last round it's going to be the same where I just keep hitting the fairway.  
   
 Q.   How is the groin feeling?  
    ANGELO QUE:   The groin is actually better now.   I'm getting a little bit of sniffles now so I'm having a hard time breathing, but should be okay.   I think I'm just really tired, so just need to get some rest after lunch and then just take it easy.  
   
 Q.   How are you enjoying Dubai?  
    ANGELO QUE:   I'm enjoying it.   A couple of the guys went skiing the other night, but I just took the tube going down, more for the kids.   I didn't want to hurt my groin more.   Enjoying it here actually.
