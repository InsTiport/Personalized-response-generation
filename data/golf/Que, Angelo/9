  ANGELO QUE:   I was hitting the ball really good.   Missed a lot of‑‑ not a lot, but I missed some close, makeable putts.   But I can't complain.   Shooting under par here every day on course is still good.

Q.   And a lot of birdies on the back nine you've picked up so far this week, what is it about that stretch of the course? 
ANGELO QUE:   It's been good.   You know, every time I get to the back nine, get the right yardage, hit the right shots and see the line.   I think it's just coincidence that I've been making birdies on the back nine, but it's good that I'm making birdies on the back nine.   I won't complain.   All I have to do is just have a good start maybe to get it going and hopefully finish off well, as well. 

Q.   You were actually on a roll, three birdies, and you dropped two shots; a bit unfortunate there. 
ANGELO QUE:   Well, that's golf.   You take what's given to you, take advantage of whatever opportunity you have, and unfortunately I wasn't able to grab it.   But you know what, I can't complain and I'm still happy.   Still Top‑10, four shots off the lead maybe, pretty good round tomorrow, maybe we can catch up.
