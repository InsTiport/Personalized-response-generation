 Q.   We ought to start with your putting, the last couple holes were terrific.  
ANGELO QUE:   I've been putting well the whole week.   You've got to hole a lot of long putts to do well.   I don't think anybody who has played a low round in their lives didn't make a 40‑footer in their rounds.   I started pretty bad and I made a couple of bogeys on the front.   
Got pretty aggressive on the 10th.   Hit a driver and got it on.   And started from there and made birdie and just kept going.   17, I holed a 40‑footer for birdie.  
   
 Q.   I presume it's going to be the same idea tomorrow, go for it, be fairly aggressive when you can?  
ANGELO QUE:   Depends on how I feel and what the yardage is.   I think today, because of the wind and the yardage, it worked to my advantage where I could just hit a soft driver and hopefully stays on the green and it did.   But it all depends on the wind and pin placement tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   You look like you're enjoying it out there and I know you said the other day you enjoy Hong Kong, a little bird told me it's the pork that does the trick here.   
ANGELO QUE:   I think so.   I love this place.   I love the food.   I'm always well‑fed here.   I'm enjoying, really enjoying the course.   Even though I make a bogey, I don't get stressed out.   I just keep going.   I'm playing well and I can always get birdie somewhere.   
   
 Q.   Special restaurant you go to?   
ANGELO QUE:   Just here.     I love the food here.   And also for two years in a row, Dominique Boulet has been inviting us over to his place and I've been requesting for pork and he's nice enough to oblige.   I've been really well fed at his place.
