 Q.  You just played Hye-Jin.  Was it weird playing against her because you're such good friends?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, we are good friends.  We are best friends in Korea.  Like seven years, six years we're playing both together, and we play in tournaments.  Today on the 4th hole she had a birdie, but I putted after Andrea, but I had a little bit of pressure.  That's why hole No. 1 and 2 I cannot stroke the putter right.  I can't stroke, yeah.   
 Q.  Why was that?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Just pressure.   
 Q.  Just the first two holes, though, the pressure?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  It doesn't stay on you for the rest of the way?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Why didn't you feel pressure on like the fifth hole?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Because it plays like a mind game.  But I think if I don't know the player style or her ranking, I can play my play.  But I know her.  I really know her.  That's why I can't -- I know she's a good player, and that's why I cannot trust me.   
 Q.  So you feel a little nervous?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Playing against somebody you know who's really good?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  So if you go down, then you don't know if you can maybe some back basically?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Now next up is Andrea.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  You just played her in the Girls' Junior in the finals.  What do you think that's going to be?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Oh, we played so nice.  It was a nice match.  But she's also a good player.  But one time I lose, one time I win.  This is the third time, so I don't know.  Just I'm playing my play tomorrow.   
 Q.  So you're not really feeling that much pressure?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  You are?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, I am.   
 Q.  Do you think that's going to go away after the first couple holes, or will it just --  
EUN JEONG SEONG: No.  No.   
 Q.  Why not?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Because I think about the Korean national team, and from Korea player there's only two, me and Hye-Jin Choi, that's why I really want to win this match.  That's why I have pressure, because tomorrow I will enjoy more.   
 Q.  Now, you just beat her like two weeks ago.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Does that give you more confidence against her?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yep.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you can go out and go beat her again?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yep.   
 Q.  How did you think you played?  Did you play okay?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Today?  Yeah, today is best.   
 Q.  Today was the best.  What was working so well?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: My iron shots were like six feet or nine feet in the green, and I make.  I had five birdies.  Today is best play.   
 Q.  So you were putting pretty well, too, then?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  So were you missing some putts?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: No, I don't miss any putts.   
 Q.  How are you feeling?  Are you tired at all?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, a little bit.  I need to take a rest, but tomorrow is only 18.   
 Q.  Plus you don't start until the afternoon.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Tomorrow?  Tomorrow is Thursday.   
 Q.  Tomorrow is Friday.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Okay.  Oh, okay, I just take a rest.
