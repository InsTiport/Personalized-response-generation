 Q.  What was the key out there today for you?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Hole No. 7, my driver in the hazard, but I make birdie this hole, but just turning point to me.   
 Q.  Five birdies in your first 10 holes of the day.  What about the greens out there?  On the back nine it looked like you were losing your pace a little bit on the greens.  What changed?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, a little bit tired because last week I played Girls' Junior, and this week I played third round today.  But I can't focus, my ball, tee shot, but she made a mistake on 12.  That's why I made par.   
 Q.  Great win last week at the U.S. Girls' Junior championship.  How do you keep that momentum going this week?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Last week I take a rest a lot.  That's why I can make good shots, make draws and hit cuts.  I can make two short birdie putts, yeah.   
 Q.  Are you taking a lot of risks out there this week?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.
