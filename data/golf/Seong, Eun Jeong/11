 Q.  Two years in a row you are the champion.  Congratulations.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Thank you.   
 Q.  Probably it's tough for you to understand that this is such a difficult thing to do, that the last time this happened was Hollis Stacy in 1971, 45 years ago.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: 1971?   
 Q.  That was the last time somebody won two years in a row.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: My mom born in '71.   
 Q.  Like I said, it's a long time ago, but 45 years, to have that happen and you be the person who did it, what does that mean to you?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: A little bit different feel, rough year, because rough year, it's a little bit hard, and my mind is also hard, tired.  But this year I trust me today, and I have confidence.  But this morning so hard because I was losing 5 down, but it's okay because I have a lot of holes, and twice tie.   
 Q.  Do you know who Hollis Stacy is?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: No.   
 Q.  Three-time Women's Open champion.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Oh.   
 Q.  She won three Women's Opens in a row, too.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: I can't following her.   
 Q.  When you were 5-down, you said you trusted me.  Did you trust you when you were 5-down still?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, but after this morning, after hole No. 10, I want to make just 2-down.  I need 3-up.  But I was losing 3-down after 18 holes.   
But back nine, was good feel my shot and putt.  That's why I can make front nine, that I can do it after back nine.   
 Q.  On your swing were you hitting shots to the right a lot early?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Did you adjust something?  It seemed like especially off the drives, right, a lot to the right?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  That was trouble for you early, right?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Every tournament I think about my swing just one point.  This tournament is going top, and I need to go left side and hit.  But sometimes timing is so bad, like the arm is come in, and I hit right side.  But it's okay because I have 36 holes, and here not so many out of bounds.  I can get up-and-down.   
 Q.  You could recover well?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  And also being 5 down, you knew 36 holes, that's a long day.  You seemed to get into a flow later in the round, especially in the afternoon.  Were you feeling really confident in the afternoon?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, because she had four birdies in the morning on the front nine.  She's parring, her iron shots is so best.  That's why I think about that because every hole is different, and every morning and afternoon is different.  I can make up because she used to birdies in the morning, but I don't have birdies.   
 Q.  Your turn was coming?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  On No. 12, how far away were you?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: The pin is 42.   
 Q.  And what club did you use?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: 60.   
 Q.  How surprised were you that you made it?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, right between the fairway and rough, too hard.  Just I think about just on the green, please.  Go in the hole.   
 Q.  How important was that in terms of giving you momentum?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, hole No. 12 is I think very important because partner is like, what's this, can't focus.  That's why I can make 13 and 14.  She shot mistakes.   
 Q.  How long was the putt on 16, the winning putt?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: 13 yards.   
 Q.  So birdie-eagle-birdie, and the par that won because she missed the putt, right?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  You were getting stronger as the day went on?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Confidence and feeling not fatigued?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, confident because after hole No. 10, she missed at hole No. 9, she don't have confidence, I think, because every short putt she missed.  My condition is a little bit -- that's why I'm confident in hole No. 11.  But 12 I missed a driver, but I can make it.  I'm really confident.   
 Q.  Andrea is a good friend?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, good friend.   
 Q.  How does it feel to have competed against a good friend?  It was a friendly match.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, maybe 2014 US Women's Amateur, same final I played with Andrea Lee, but I was losing because her putting is so best, and her course management is best.  That's why she can a lot of wins.  But today I know she plays -- I know I can win her because I losing before.   
 Q.  She beat you 2 & 1, I think in the Amateur?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  But that was a good match, too?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  One win apiece now?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Would you rather have this one?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  You stayed with Cindy Ha this week?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yes.   
 Q.  How do you know her?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: She played this year U.S. Open.  2014 I met Cindy in PubLinks, and Girls' Junior I met Andrea Lee and Robin.  We eat together because I speak English more bad.  I can't register; they helped me.   
 Q.  You got to be good friends?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yes.   
 Q.  How nice was it staying with her this week?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, because I can eat Korean food, and better than hotel.   
 Q.  Two in a row; do you think you have another chance next year?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What do you think?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Just probably try again.   
 Q.  Are you tired right now?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: I'm tired, but I'm good.  I feel good.   
 Q.  Good tired?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, good tired.
