 Q.  You'll play your game?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  What was the toughest part of today?  What was the hardest thing today?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: She played good because she maybe almost -- every time she hit second shot, but I have a little bit of pressure sometimes because she near to pin, but I have a lot of -- I make par putts.  That's why I can good play today.   
 Q.  I know you said it was a hard day; do you know Mathilda at all?  Had you met her before?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: No, I don't know her.  And I can't understand the French --

 Q.  You never trailed today?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Sorry?   
 Q.  You were never behind today?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yes.   
 Q.  But never more than a 2-up lead.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Was that tough at all?  You couldn't pull away.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: I think every win, I going up after front nine because my feelings so tired, but I think other players are more tired that they make mistakes some holes, that's why I can easy going to the back nine.   
 Q.  Do you think maybe -- do you play better on the back nine?  Do you like those holes better, or is it just your strength that you think gets you through?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, just -- because I think after quarterfinals, we're always tired.  We can't shape shots, and we have mistakes, more big mistakes.  That's why I think we need more par saves.   
 Q.  Pars win holes?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Is it the same in the junior?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, same the junior.  But here course is more hard.  Green is too hard.
