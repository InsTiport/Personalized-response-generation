 Q. I guess only two birdies today; were you happy with how you played?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Today was I think better than yesterday, but today's condition is not so good because yesterday I had 36 holes. That's why I'm a little bit tired. Today tee shot is a little bit off.   
   
 Q. You won a lot of holes, but she also won some holes. What was the difference today between how you played compared to how she played?   
EUN JEONG SEONG: She missed short putts on the front nine, maybe two short putt mistakes, but I made short putts. That's why I won 2‑up or 3‑up. I was relaxed. That's why I can play good on the course.   
   
 Q. Now, in the semifinals there are three Koreans.   
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.  
   
 Q. And then I guess you're friends with Andrea Lee.   
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.  
   
 Q. So you're basically friends with everyone. Is it nice to have all these people in the semifinals with you?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Well, it feels funny but not so good because they're friends. Sometimes like short putts we need to concede, but it's not good. But I feel funny this afternoon.  
   
 Q. Have you played any of them before in match play?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: No.   
   
 Q. So this will be the first time?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
   
 Q. Have you guys talked about the possibility of you playing with each other?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.  
   
 Q. Are you kind of nervous, excited?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, excited. Excited, yeah, because they're all Korean but Andrea is still in U.S. but she's Korean.
