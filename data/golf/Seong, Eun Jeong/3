 Q.  Eun Jeong Seong, you are the 116th US Women's Amateur champion.  How does it feel to put your name on that trophy?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: I can't believe today.  Last week and last year Girls' Junior, I can't believe it.  Just happy.  But today is different feeling because I made history, and after another Amateur or Girls, they won't make this history.  That's why I feel so amazing.   
 Q.  So you're the first person that's ever won a Girls' Junior and the Women's Amateur, the only person to win a Boys' Junior and a Men's Amateur is Tiger Woods.  Only you and Tiger.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yesterday I saw the FOX Sports, and they -- Tiger Woods and me, our records, but I'm very -- that's good because Tiger was this amazing golfer, No. 1 golfer.  This is so -- I can't forget today.   
 Q.  Let's go straight to the putt on 18.  Talk about rebounding after she makes that amazing putt on 17, then you come in and drain one on top of her.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: 17 Virginia's putt is so hard.  I think about if she make, if she make, I need to make that.  My putt is easy, but Virginia's putt is so hard, but she made it, and my hands is move --   
 Q.  Shaking?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, shaking, and after putt she made, I have aim because I'm 1-up.  If I lose this hole, I can go playoff, so I regret, and before I walking to ball, I saw almost same break and same distance, and I just think about please two-putt, please two-putt, because Virginia putt is so hard because this morning I putt Virginia ball.  But I made it.  I'm surprised.   
 Q.  You were surprised to make it?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.  My action is not too big, not too big.  But today is -- I want to try to be --   
 Q.  You were excited?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  What were you thinking when Virginia was struggling physically on the 14th on the back of the tee, took a break?  What was that like for you?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Oh, I can't understand the rules.  She told me, but I can't understand.  Just break 10 minutes?  Okay.  But I think she headache and she can't see -- like why.  I think today is too hot maybe.  11:00 to 12:00 is too hot, and I don't know this, but I practicing on 13 green -- yeah, 13 green.  I ask, can I practice, and she said, yes, you can.  But this is good for me because this turning point because I lose that hole, but she take a rest.  That's why I can relax that hole, and I won this hole, yeah.   
 Q.  Was your mom here when you won either of your Girls' Junior titles?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: No.   
 Q.  So this is the first time she --  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, this is the first time.   
 Q.  Was that special for you?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, special to me, but sometimes I have problems with my mom.  Maybe every day.  Every morning.  But I love mom.  My mom too tired because she work -- she had work.  In my house I can see my mom's face because she going out early and she come in too late, and I sleep.  That's why I can't see my mom.   
After 18 she crying a little bit, but it's okay.  She's just happy now.   
 Q.  Did you cry at all?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: No.   
 Q.  How did you get along with Tom, your caddie?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Oh, Tom.  I think about caddies, just caddies not distance and break, well, it's not important, because just say like calm down, or hey, focus your ball, and like just one -- I think talking is good because break is just almost see my eyes, but he told me every time, don't pressure now and don't forget, and keep going.  It's good, help me.   
 Q.  You liked him?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  The communication was good with him?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you think you will play in this again next year?  Or will you be a pro?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Me?  I don't know that because my mom want to go turn pro, but I still next year in amateur, and I want to play in LPGA tournaments.  I think turn pro is next year, Q-school maybe.   
 Q.  Later?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, later.   
 Q.  Because you have to be an amateur to play in the Women's Open and the British Open and everything.

EUN JEONG SEONG: This year, February.   
 Q.  So you qualified -- you played a qualifier to get in?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on playing in the Women's Open?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: The Women's Open?  I try five times, but I didn't make it because I have pressure every qualifying.  But my mom last year, my mom said, you win Women's Amateur and you got in.  But last year is Hannah O'Sullivan, but this year I make it.   
 Q.  This was easier than a qualifying round?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yes.  I think so, because now it's going up, my condition is good.   
 Q.  It seems like your physical condition helped you maybe deal with the heat?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, every -- I fitness every day, and I stretching before sleep.  That's good for me, and sometimes I text my coach in Korea.  She live in Korea, and he told me, hey, go easy.  After golf you going to fitness and work out.  That's good for me.  That's when I first -- because Virginia is hot and tired, that's why she need take a rest hole No. 13, but I'm good.  After 14 my caddie told me, every shot, time, he's like, are you okay, are you okay.  Yes, I'm okay.  I'm good.
