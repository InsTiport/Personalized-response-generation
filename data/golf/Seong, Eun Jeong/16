Q. You're going to the final.  You've been to a finals here before in USA Championships.  What is this like?EUN JEONG SEONG: My iron shots are the best this week, and my putting is so bad, but I make birdies, because here the course is very short and I can make many birdies.Q. So you've been putting yourself in good position on the green?EUN JEONG SEONG: Yes.Q. You hit it far?EUN JEONG SEONG: Yes.Q. Is that a big advantage on this course?EUN JEONG SEONG: Yes.  Yes, because hole No. 1 has a right turn, the course.  Another player has 150 yards, but my second shot was just 100 yards.Q. Seems like you figured out that first hole, too.  You've won that every single day this week.EUN JEONG SEONG: Yes.Q. Does that give you confidence?EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.  Like hole No. 1, my driver shot is exciting, but another player always has a bogey, and I can calm down.Q. How far on average do you think that you can drive the ball?EUN JEONG SEONG: I think 270 or 280 yards.Q. Are you finding throughout your matches so far that you have been hitting it further than your opponent and that is what's been the difference, that your distance has been further than your opponent?EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.  Now Angel is very far, but tomorrow is very tired, I think.  Tomorrow very important to calm down.Q. What do you think of when you go into the championship tomorrow?  What is in your head?  Do you feel pressure going into the championship?EUN JEONG SEONG: No, because last year I lose the final, but I need to win tomorrow.  (Also made it to finals of the 2014 Women's Amateur Public Links.)Q. What would it mean to you if you win tomorrow?EUN JEONG SEONG: I like the USGA and I want to reach the USGA.  That's why I need a win.
