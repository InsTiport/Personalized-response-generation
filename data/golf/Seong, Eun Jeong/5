 Q.  Tough match against a friend today.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  What was it like out there?  You guys weren't as chitchatty as you are at lunch.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, maybe almost every breakfast and lunch with Andrea, we every time kidding, yeah.  But in the match we're very serious.   
 Q.  Is it hard playing a friend?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, it's hard, because sometimes concede is --   
 Q.  You want to concede but you can't?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Tell me about how the course is changing out there, how much more difficult it was today.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Andrea and me, also, we didn't play 16, 17, 18.  My first time to play today.  But I don't know, the last hole is too short, 40 yards, too short.  Course today pins were too hard with the slope.  I cannot -- like fast.  Too hard.   
 Q.  When you say 18 was short, what do you mean?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Oh, because stroke play is like 480 yards, back.   
 Q.  Oh, they moved it up?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, they moved.   
 Q.  Does the Women's Am feel different than the Girls' Junior to you?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, because Girls' Junior is almost same my age, but the Women's Amateur is like college players and top players coming here like from other countries, national team.  That's why it's a little bit hard.   
 Q.  So what are your plans, speaking of college?  I'm assuming college, American College isn't anything you're thinking about?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: I just like Stanford.   
 Q.  You like Stanford?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, just like.   
 Q.  But you want to turn professional?

 Q.  Would you actually entertain Stanford?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  Going to Stanford?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, but I cannot, I think.  Just I like Stanford.   
 Q.  So you think you will turn pro at some point?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yep.   
 Q.  Any idea when?

EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.   
 Q.  What do you think was the turning point of the match for you today for momentum for you?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: I'd say hole No. 15.  She missed a tee shot, and I go 1-up.  I can play relaxed.   
 Q.  You have a chance to be the first person to win both the Girls' Junior and the Women's Am in the same year.  Have you thought about that very much?
