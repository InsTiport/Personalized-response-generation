Q. Another good performance; how do you think you played today?
EUN JEONG SEONG: This afternoon my energy is done.  That's why I'm too tired.  I can't focus.  My short game, I made so many mistakes.
Q. What about some of the good stuff, though?  You didn't hit a lot of fairways, but you hit a lot of greens and you made some important putts.  Could you talk about that?
EUN JEONG SEONG: Oh, yeah.  This afternoon, front nine I had three important putts that I make it.
Q. How about that shot on 9?  Talk to me about that.
EUN JEONG SEONG: I hit a pitching wedge.  I want to hit front, 10 yards, 10 yards front, and I made a good shot.
Q. How many yards did you hit your pitching wedge?
EUN JEONG SEONG: On No. 9 I had 110, but it was really 125.
Q. It was 125 because it was up the hill?
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah.
Q. Talk about having a chance to win again.
EUN JEONG SEONG: I need to enjoy tomorrow.
Q. What do you think you have to do better tomorrow to have a chance to win?
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, I will feel better tomorrow because I'm rested.  I have confidence tomorrow.
Q. The Same person has not won two years in a row.  Before you were born is the last time someone won twice.  Your thoughts on that, on that hasn't been done in a long time and you have a chance to do it twice?
EUN JEONG SEONG: Okay, I will try.
