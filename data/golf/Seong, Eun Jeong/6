 Q.  Take me through your day, please.  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Today is great match with Andrea Lee.  She's a good player, and she's always good like driver and iron, putter, always good.  But today is so hard match.  We like up and down every hole.  But she missed a birdie putt, that's why I really easy up.   
 Q.  What about your second shot into 18, great iron shot?  
EUN JEONG SEONG: Yeah, the distance is 173 yards.  I used 6-iron.  But I controlled a little bit, but a little bit rolled.  But I think that's best shot.
