  Q. Talk about the course.   
 MARK KEATING: Well the golf course is muddy and a terrific challenge. If you make mistakes, you pay big. Which I found out. But it's beautiful.   
  
  Q. The conditions, how are they today?  
 MARK KEATING: They're fine. They're fine. If you hit your ball in the fairways, of course we're playing it up, you can hit a good lie if you do that. And again, if you hit it wide you're going to pay the penalty. But that would be the same if it was in dry conditions for several days too. So, yeah, it's good.  
  
  Q. Just want to get an overview of your first round?  
 MARK KEATING: I struggled, I hit some wild shots, but I'm not unhappy. I played most of the course well. And I made about I think three doubles. I'm 6-over, so that's it.
