Q. You reel off four birdies in a row as you're making the turn, you got to feel good about the 67 today.
KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah, it does feel good, really proud of the last three rounds I played.  Putter was hot and cold, extreme both ways.  So off to a slow start with the putter, really struck it nicely today, and couldn't get anything to go.  Once I saw one go, I made four in a row and really had some momentum, kind of cooled down late.  But all in all a good day and a good week especially after starting off so slowly on Thursday.
