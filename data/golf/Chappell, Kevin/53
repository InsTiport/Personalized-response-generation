Q.   Nice start to the tournament.   12 points.   Get some thoughts on your day. 
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah, it was easy.   Made six birdies, no bogeys.   Played the par‑5s well; played them 3‑under, and then, you know, just managed on the rest of the golf course, which is nice.

Q.   You like this format?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah, it's fun.   I catch myself being in between conservative and being aggressive.   If you can keep that aggressive mentality the whole week and execute the shots, I think it plays to your advantage.

Q.   Pretty benign out there today with the conditions. 
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah, about as easy as it can play.   Green speeds are great.   They were smooth this morning, but you can see that with some play this afternoon they might get a little bumpy.   Might see some scores a little higher in the afternoon. 
Overall, you know, it couldn't be a better day.

Q.   Any birdies that stand out of the six? 
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Birdie on 11.   Stretch there had a bunch of wedges in my hands and didn't make any birdies.   Hit a 9‑iron in there close on ‑ or 8‑iron in there close on 11 and knocked it in to kind of get things kick started again on the back side, which was good.

Q.   Just a couple weeks left in the regular season.   Goals for the rest of the year? 
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   You know, obviously move up as far as you can in the FedExCup points and be playing the best golf of the year going into the playoffs. 
I feel like my game is in good shape.   I look forward to three more rounds here and then making a run at the PGA.
