 Q.  First group out, how did it feel today?  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  A position I asked to be in.  Disappointed to only get a halve, but you know, being down on the 17th tee and having a putt to potentially win, you know, I fought hard.  Neither of us played great golf the whole day but we played great in stretches.  It's probably a fitting end to the match.   
 Q.  18 isn't a hole where we've seen a ton of birdies, a ton of great tee shots this week.  That tee shot looked really good and the putt almost went in.  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: We both hit beautiful tee shots and good putts there.  Ironic that I gave a putt of that length yesterday.  I think in the situation, it was the right thing to do, to have Marc knock it in and have the match finish all-square.
