  Q. (Question regarding watching the leaderboard.)  
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: Didn't really know what Luke was doing. There's not too many leaderboards out there for us to look at.   
 Obviously we could hear a few roars, but didn't know -- what did he make eight birdies in a row or six birdies in a row or something?  
  
  Q. Yeah.  
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: Okay. So we didn't know. For me, it was obviously a tough day. Didn't drive it as good as I did the last couple days and didn't hit it as close to the hole and didn't make many putts.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: It was really comfortable. Just trying to keep doing the same things that got me in that position. I was pretty good through six, seven holes. Still didn't feel like I drove it great.  
 You know, had some great lies. Was able to (indiscernible) to make that bogey on 8, and then bad par on 10 and bogey on 11. That kind of slowed things down.
