 Q.   Tell us how your round went.   How did you find the course with the rain fall this morning compared to how it played yesterday?   
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Well I guess whatever rain fall fell this morning, last night, made it so there was a lot more mud balls today.   Fortunately there's some standing water out there, so you're getting relief.   A lot of times you have the mud ball, which is nice.   
But overall, the course is in as good of shape as they can make it with the rain they have gotten.   The green are really nice and it's a fair test of golf.  
   
 Q.   Are you finding it to play long?   
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   It's played the same wind all week.   I wouldn't necessarily say it's playing longer or shorter than any other round.   It's never been really firm, that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   I know the four birdies today; how are you feeling‑‑ you played a good game but do you feel like you could do better?   
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah, I've done par 5s even par today playing from the middle of the fairway each one of them.   So obviously that's disappointing.   But you know, something to improve on tomorrow, and just keep doing the same good things and see what happens.
