 Q.  Kevin, 4-under, 68.  Beautiful morning for golf.  Your thoughts on how you did out there today.  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah, sure was a beautiful morning.  The golf course is in fantastic shape.  I got off to a great start with a 4-under through 4 and just kind of cruised around from there.   
Played the par-5s great, par-3s not so well and, you know, adds up to a 4-under par.  But, all in all, pretty happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  It almost got away from you, you had the bogey at 7, 8 you had to lay up but you played a great iron in the green.  Sometimes those par saves are as big as birdies.  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: That was nice to I guess end the round that way and not ideal tee shot, mishit and the wind kind of gusted on me.  Had to lay up.  That's why I work hard on my short game so when you are out of position you can -- you still feel like you can salvage a score and I did a good job of that today, laid up on a few par-5s and was able to get up and down and make some birdies as well.   
 Q.  Going through your record here, this is the second time you've been under 70 on this golf course.  What clicked this time because I think your previous low round was a 69?  This is one better than that.  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: It's a place I feel comfortable just with what my record says.  The sight lines are good for me and I think I've matured and learned to play the golf course.   
It's a place you have to pick your spots and not get too aggressive, really kind of playing away from a lot of pins but it also gives you a lot as well.   
 Q.  Congratulations on your day.  Good luck tomorrow.  
KEVIN CHAPPELL: Thank you.
