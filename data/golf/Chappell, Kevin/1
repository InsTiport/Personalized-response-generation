  Q. You talked about what you've been going through; what do you take out of today?
 KEVIN CHAPPELL:   I've got as much firepower as I need.  I've got to figure out the bad stuff and limit it.  I'm physically going to make bad golf swings and hit it in bad places.  That's just kind of where my game is at the moment, but I compounded some mistakes out there and let it get out of hand, so those are things that I've got to stop because I think my firepower is enough to keep me in the golf tournament.
 Q. You're a big goal setter.  What are your goals for this week and for right now?
 KEVIN CHAPPELL:   To win.  That's why I came.  That's why I tee it up in every event.  We're here to win the golf tournament, and was in a really good position through 27 holes to do that and create some separation, and I didn't do that.  Probably will be five shots back going into the weekend, and that's going to be a big mountain to climb, but I'll tee it up tomorrow afternoon when they give me my tee time and I'll try and climb that mountain.
 Q. Are you headed to the range to try and fix something?
 KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah, I'll go practice and kind of touch it all and continue with the feels that I've had and hopefully own those better than I did on that back nine that I just played.
