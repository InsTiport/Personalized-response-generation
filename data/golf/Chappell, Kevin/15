Q. You birdied five of the last seven.  64 is a really good score here.  What hit the switch for you?
KEVIN CHAPPELL: I was probably more patient than I have been in any rounds.  Obviously nice to see a few putts go in.  You know, a few lucky breaks.  Hit it in the rough there on 13.  Had a good enough lie to be able to hit it at the green, which is massive on that hole.
You know, get out of 14 after a bad drive with par and make a long one on 15, and played 16, 17 and 18 really about as perfect as you can.
Q. You really did.  Now you've had a great year, a chance now after the move today to win this, the first Playoff event, and you've also positioned yourself back in the Top-10 for The Presidents Cup.  How important is that to make that team, because I know you want to play in that competition.
KEVIN CHAPPELL: You know, for me, the focus is on the FedExCup.  I think if I can get myself in that TOUR Championship, it would be hard for Captain Stricker not to take me if I didn't earn it myself.  That's where my focus is, trying to get into East Lake.  I really feel like I've got some unfinished business there from last year.  I want to take care of that.
