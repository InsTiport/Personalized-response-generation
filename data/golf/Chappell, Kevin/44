 Q.  If we can just get some comments on your day.  KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah, obviously a solid round of golf in the elements.  A couple bogeys today, which is what it is.  I think starting the day if you would have told me I was going to shoot 3-under par and it was going to rain 12 of my 18 holes, I would have taken it.  All in all, happy with my game, happy with where I'm at.  Always enjoy being here at the Greenbrier.   Q.  Obviously the golf course fits your eye, you're very comfortable on it, but you being a Fresno boy, you're probably not accustomed to playing in a whole heck of a lot of rain, especially being from Fresno.  What are you and your caddie doing out there differently to keep you organized during the course of the round?  KEVIN CHAPPELL: I'd say just, to counter your statement, I think my low round of the year came in rain at the beginning of the year in Phoenix.   Q.  So you're a mudder?  KEVIN CHAPPELL: I kind of pride myself on just being tough and knowing that attitude is going to go a long ways in conditions.  Actually it's kind of been an awkward week.  It's the first week with the new caddie, so we've got to play percentage here, you've got elements, so it's been a good feeling-out process.  It makes us get close quickly. You know, what are we doing different, you've got to be patient.  You've got to understand that you're going to hit some weird shots.  Yesterday I hit one on 11, got some water on the face and the ball took off -- hadn't missed a fairway yet, and the ball took off 40 yards right.  That's going to happen here, so you've just got to do the best job you can of eliminating those type of mistakes.
