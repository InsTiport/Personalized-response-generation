  DOUG MILNE:   We'd like to welcome Kevin Chappell.   Fantastic week, 68 today, and your fantastic second shot on 18 to put a sharp point on things.   Your career best finish this week here at the Memorial.   I'll turn it over to you for comments on the week.
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Obviously it was a great week.   A couple of shots short of what I wanted.   But with the rÃ©sumÃ© I've had up to this point, I can't complain about it.   I've been working hard on the right things and it's nice to see it pay off.

Q.   Can you talk about the adrenaline of those last few holes?   You obviously put a little pressure on Matt, and what you thought on 18 when you stuffed that close?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   To be honest, it wasn't an out of body experience by any means.   I wasn't part of the conversation all day.   And I played a solid back nine to get close, but when Matt hit that chip on 16, it was, all right, get this up and down and see what happens.   And I got my ball up and down, and Matt missed. 
And I hit it‑‑ a good iron shot on 17 and made it.   I kind of figured Matt would make his putt. 
On 18, once you hit it on the green, it's been a year since I three‑putted.   Actually I three‑putted here. 
It's been a while.   And he's world class with that putter and I figured it was over with. 

Q.   Talk about the front nine.   You had a lot of opportunities, you just weren't able to ‑‑
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   I hit it well.   Didn't feel like I hit the putter like I did yesterday.   The putt I made on 12 for par really kind of got some confidence going and I was able to roll in the last one on 13, as well.

Q.   Also run through 15.   You hit that great second shot. 
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   I played that hole great all week.   No longer than 40 feet for eagle in the four rounds I played.   It was a good number for me.   A little awkward lie, but I just kind of held up up there against the wind.

Q.   Did you and Matt say anything to each other after you hit your shots on 18?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   He gave me a thumbs up and I reciprocated.   When he walked up on 18 tee, it was like, well done.

Q.   Were there any putts on the front side that you thought you should have made?   Some of them were pretty long putts?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Nine, 7, 6 (laughter) excuse me‑‑ 6, 5, not 7, 6. 

Q.   6, 5 not 7 many?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah.   Did I have it 13 feet on one? 

Q.   Nine. 
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   I feel like I gave away a few shots there.   If you would have told me before the round started I'd shoot bogey for 68, I would have liked my chances.

Q.   You're in there‑‑ did you come in with a number, what's the mindset when you're in that same group?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   I didn't have a number in mind.   I think they said it was supposed to blow 12 or 15.   It sure didn't seem like it blew that hard.   I got off to a great start.   My slow start kind of kept me out of the conversation.   I was kind of second wheel there until maybe 13.   And I was just trying to put together a good round of golf and made some birdies and was able to finish it out.

Q.   Matt always seems to be hovering in the top 10.   He's had 35 top 10 finishes since the start of the 2010 season.   What does that say to you?   And what is the key, do you think, to his consistency?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   His bad shots hit greens, first of all.   And he's really good with the putter.   I think I heard Faldo say on TV last week he's not a ten in every category of his game, but he's better than seven in all aspects of the game.   And he just doesn't make very many mistakes. 
I think I was fortunate to get as close as I did, because he did make a mistake on 16.   But it was a tough hole and who's to say he shouldn't have made bogey.

Q.   How difficult does that make him to chase, because of what you just said because you know he's not going to make a lot of bad mistakes?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   He's not going to give you much.   You've got to go get it.   This isn't a golf course where you can force the issue too much.   Yeah, I was fortunate to get as close as I did.

Q.   Yesterday you had that great analogy about playing in the wind with the prize fighter.   What would you say about playing with the leader today in contention, chasing the leader?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   There's nothing appropriate.   Whipped cream on dog doo.   It was a great day, but I came up short.

Q.   Does Matt's beard make him look meaner?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   We weren't gazing into each other's eyes much.   It's a good look for him.
