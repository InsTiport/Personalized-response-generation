 Q. Little bit of a hiccup. Had a great comeback. Tell me about your day.
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: I think you summed it up right there. Got off to a good start, really hit some shots that got to good spots and rolled the two putts, and never expect to make eagle on 18 but had a number that I thought was good and hit a hybrid in there, 30 feet, made it. 
 Made the turn and made a couple bad swings on 10 and actually made a 10-footer for bogey and was kind of all right, broke momentum from that, kind of got a break on the tee shot and tried to do too much of it. Got my wits back to me and hit some good shots coming up.

 Q. After a hole like No. 2 where you go back down to where you were, is it hard for you to say to yourself, "Calm down, I've got plenty of holes left, I'm going to have to stay patient" or do you stand on the third tee and, "God, get this back right now"?
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: You want to get it back, I know but 3 is a tough hole. You got to hit a good shot there. I think just the difficulty of the hole in front of you helps kind of refocus you.

 Q. Now, tell me about how you're feeling about your good swing and whatnot coming in this week.
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: I've been struggling. I feel I made some big strides in Houston even though I missed the cut. Game feels good. Got to hit some fairways this week.
