Q.   Obviously just probably a little disappointed about your finish there, but overall you're still in a good position heading into Sunday. 
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah, my game's in a good spot, and that's always nice to be confident going into Sunday.   Really struggled kind of finding the speed and the rhythm of the game once we went back out from the rain delay, something I'll have to do better tomorrow, because inevitably there will be a rain delay.   So I need to get off to a quick start around here and see what happens.

Q.   How do you mentally prepare yourself knowing that you maybe didn't handle it as well as you would have liked and there could be a potential for one tomorrow?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   You learn from it.   You learn how the golf course changes.   I thought I did a really good job finishing on Thursday after the rain delay, I made four birdies in five holes, and really kind of‑‑ or three birdies in four holes or whatever it was and really kind of got myself back in contention.
So probably not think about today and think about what I did on Thursday, and really go out there and attack.

Q.   If there's a key for you ultimately winning tomorrow, what is it that you have to focus on?
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   I just gotta make some putts.   With the exception of the last hole I've hit it great all week, and I just haven't really made anything.   I feel like if I putt the way I know I can, we'd be in a different position, but you know, maybe my time is tomorrow.
