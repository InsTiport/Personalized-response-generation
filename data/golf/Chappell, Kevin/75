 Q. 5-under, obviously in great shape heading into the final round tomorrow. Tell me about how you're feeling and how you're playing.
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: I feel good. This golf course is tough just because it doesn't ever let up driving. You can make a big number on any hole. So it's exciting to be in the position I'm in but anyone within five, six shots of the lead can have a chance tomorrow if they can play a good round in the wind.

 Q. What was the wind factor like today, big difference between yesterday and today?
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah. It blew opposite direction and it blew five to ten miles an hour less which, you know, makes some holes a lot easier, some holes harder and seemed like the long par-4s played downwind which is nice and you get the par-5s playing into the wind which took away some of the scoring opportunity. I was lucky I managed to play those holes okay.

 Q. You're obviously going to have a late tee time tomorrow. What's the mindset? You happy with the way everything is going, all the elements of the game?
 KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah. Be nice to hit a few more fairways, feel like I hit the fairway I'm able to score. The rough is just long enough to alter some shots and make it just uncomfortable enough not to hit it close to the hole.
