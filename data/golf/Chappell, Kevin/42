 Q.  Kevin, clean scorecard today, 7-under.  Talk about the round a little bit.  KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah.  You know, it was nice to play a solid round of golf.  Last week was a bit of an anomaly and worked really hard this weekend with my coach, Mark Blackburn and really felt like that the transfer was there. The golf course was obviously soft from the weather we've had and I was able to control my golf ball spin-wise but also distance control and give myself some good looks at birdie.   Q.  Did you feel there was a good number out there with how soft the golf course and the conditions out there this morning?  KEVIN CHAPPELL: Even for me I thought I could have had two, three, four more lower than I did but, all in all, I was happy with the day and I think you'll see some low scoring this afternoon depending on the weather.   Q.  Kevin, just chat a little bit about you mentioned last week was an anomaly.  You built up quite a bit of momentum from Wells Fargo to John Deere.  Talk a little bit about that.  KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah, it was how can I say, the week before was kind of my first week off --   Q.  Right.  KEVIN CHAPPELL: -- the first week off for the year.  I enjoyed it a little too much.  Then it was my first week away from the family in awhile being in Canada, getting used to not -- just not being home and this was never comfortable personally or professionally and it showed in my play but got in some great work this weekend and we'll see if it's transferred.   Q.  No bogies today.  What was the key to the round overall?  KEVIN CHAPPELL: I hit a lot of greens, 16 of 18 greens and then the two up and downs where I made a 4-footer and tap-in on the last.  So, you know, never really had any stress.  You know, frustrating 3-putt par on No. 5 but, all in all, really solid day
