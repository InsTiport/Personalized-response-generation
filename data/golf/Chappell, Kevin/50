 Q.   Bogey‑free around this place is pretty darned good.   
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah, a good round of golf.   Definitely carrying over some momentum from the PGA.   Feel like I'm really driving the ball well and that's the key to this golf course.   
Today was mistake‑free which was nice, or maybe not mistake‑free, but I was able to clean up the garbage when I needed it.  
   
 Q.   You drove the ball well.   
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   The rough is long and unpredictable which makes it tough to score out of.   That's the key, stay out of that.  
   
 Q.   You have to feel good about things, game is in a good spot?  
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   Yeah, game is in a good spot, I'm in a good spot.   Especially look at the scorecard, I have not played the easy holes very well and I look forward to doing that this weekend and keeping the same formula and seeing what happens.  
   
 Q.   Enjoying being around New York City?   
KEVIN CHAPPELL:   You know, we haven't done too much.   I think we're going to go to city tonight and go to dinner with a friend.   It's always nice to be in the Playoffs and grind it out for hopefully 16 rounds and take a break.
