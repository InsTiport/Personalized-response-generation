Q. Congratulations.  Beating Daniel Berger, that's not an easy out, is it?
KEVIN CHAPPELL: No, Daniel's a hell of a player.  And I don't think either of us had our "A" game today.  But for me I'm fortunate to sneak away with a win.
Q. Is that one of the nice things about match play?  You talk about how tough it is, but if you don't have your "A" game, you can still blow out a victory?
KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yeah, that is great.  I was able to make six birdies in 16 holes we played, and birdied the last three.  Found a little bit of momentum there towards the end.  We definitely gave away more holes than we'd like to in match play.  I guess that's the beauty of match play, you make a double and you're 1-down.
Q. If that's not your "A" game, I'd like to see your "A" game coming tomorrow.  Speak about that pairing for another day.  You win a match but usually you move on, but you've got to move on to another match tomorrow in the same pod?
KEVIN CHAPPELL: Yes, I think I've got Tommy Fleetwood tomorrow morning.  Tommy is also a great player.  And looks like he got beat today by Ian, who has a great history in this event.  Tommy is going to come out fine, and I'm going to need to make less mistakes, and keep the birdies on the board.
