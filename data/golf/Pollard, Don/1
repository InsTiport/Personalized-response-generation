  Q. Can you talk a little about your eagle from earlier today?   
 DON POLLARD: Oh, I had hit driver off the tee and hit it really well. Got out there and had 90 yards back to the nose, and hit a 60-degree lob wedge. And Jeremy, my caddie, my son, he said, Dad, just hit it up 15 feet right of the hole and it will feed right down there, so we did, and that's what it did.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the day overall?   
 DON POLLARD: It was an awesome day. I made some mistakes, and my putting wasn't very good. I shot 70 in the U.S. Open, so it's a good day.  
  
  Q. What do you think you'll have to adjust for tomorrow?   
 DON POLLARD: Well, hopefully we'll get in tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Oh, well --  
 DON POLLARD: If we get in, we'll figure it out. But I would say it's probably not enough. It was a little bit too high the first day, but it was a good round today. That was about it.   
 But we had a great time. Played with two great guys and we all had a good time. It was good, it was fun. The 2, that's what you play golf for. That roar out there was nice.
