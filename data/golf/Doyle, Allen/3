 Q.  How was it out there? 
 ALLEN DOYLE:  Well, we did okay, but, you know, we had a bad round yesterday, and you hope it doesn't happen, but it did, and, you know, we had high hopes, and we go home a little disappointed, but that is the way it is.  We went home the last two years very happy, and we'll be going home disappointed this year. 

 Q.  Was it the course? 
 ALLEN DOYLE:  No, I thought the course played great; the wind was down, so it played the easiest we could get it, really. 
 I hit the ball okay, but you get one a little left and a little right, and then you make bogey, and then you make a few more, and you try to make something happen and it doesn't happen, so it was one of those things, just had an off day. 

 Q.  Do you think the delay of yesterday was a factor? 
 ALLEN DOYLE:  It wasn't any problem for me, anyway.  We were struggling before that anyway, and when we reached that, no, that didn't affect me at all. 

 Q.  The popularity of the 3-peat, the hype of the week, does it weigh on you? 
 ALLEN DOYLE:  When everybody was saying the 3-peat, there's a reason why no one has.  And if you've been through this kind of stuff before -- I tried to underplay it and downplay it some, but golf is a game; when you're on, you're on, and you can make things happen.  When you're a little off, sometimes you just can't make them happen, and that was the way it was yesterday.  We'll go home with two trophies in the case, and I guess we got to be happy with that.
