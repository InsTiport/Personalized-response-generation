Q.
With all the rain and things like that, what do you think of the course conditions right now?
ALLEN DOYLE:  They're still perfect.  With all the rain, you know, it's, the drainage must be great or the terrain, but you really couldn't tell that we have had a lot of rain.
Q.  Do you feel that you can be more aggressive with a few of these pins and things like that because of the course conditions now?
ALLEN DOYLE:  Absolutely.  The greens are holding pretty well.  And so there aren't a lot of holes that I feel that you can do that.  When I say that, you got some long holes that you if the pin is tucked enough you can't really be aggressive hitting in with 4 and 5 irons.  But when you hit to the hole with 7 iron in, knowing the greens are a little softer, you can be an a little more aggressive, absolutely.
