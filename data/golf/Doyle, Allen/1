 Q.  Just have a few questions for you.  Obviously, you're from the area.  What's it feel like coming back here and playing?  
ALLEN DOYLE: It's always great to come back to home.  Then when you get to play in an event like this, it's neat.  I wish I'd played better, but the legs are a little old.  So we did the best we could.   
But it's always great to come back.  Around home, a lot of people still recognize me and root for me.  So it's neat.   
 Q.  Did you feel like there was kind of a fan warming to you?  
ALLEN DOYLE: Oh, sure, there was.  New England has always held their own in high esteem.  Probably more people recognize me and say hello than I think would.  So that's a nice thing to have.   
So, yeah, we love coming back, and I brought my two girls and their husbands up and the three grandkids to see all their nieces and nephews.  So it's a great trip.   
 Q.  Just kind of walk me through a little bit of your round today.  
ALLEN DOYLE: I struggled a bit.  I drove it good.  I hit every fairway.  So I put myself in position.  The course plays long for me.  So I was hitting in -- I had 220 into 18 and 223 into 9 and 230 into 2.  So it was a little bit of a struggle, the length.  But I made some good up and downs.  I guess I could have shot a couple shots better, but I probably could have shot a couple shots worse too.  So I got to be happy.
