 Q.  How was the experience today?  
GREGG PETTERSEN: For me it was just a bit surreal.  Just amazing experience.  I've been here for 15 years as a professional, so get to play links obviously quite regular.  I've never played in front of that sort of crowds at all over the years.  It's just been maybe a couple of people spectating.   
It really was a fantastic experience.  The crowds were great.  A lot of local people who know me cheering me on.   
 Q.  When did you get the call?  
GREGG PETTERSEN: Last night about ten to ten.  I just actually just left the building, so just walking back to my car.  Nice phone call to have.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: Yeah, basically in 2008, I probably would have done it.  There was only one marker required that day over that weekend.  It was one of the things we had.  So I did speak to the R&A yesterday.  They said if it is, you will be getting a call.   
So, yeah, great experience for me.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: Yeah.  I have no idea, to be honest with you.  Yeah, I'll be going back in this afternoon, back to normal.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: I don't know.  Probably about 5-over, I think, 4- or 5-over.  I've hit it really nicely.  There's two bad tee shots on 15.  And then approach shot into 17.  And other than that, hit it quite nicely.  But I had lots of three-putts, I'm not used to the pace of greens, at all, eight, ten-footers coming back.   
 Q.  What was the highlight of your day?  
GREGG PETTERSEN: I think the highlight was getting the first tee shot.  I wasn't expecting the crowds to be like that all the way around.  I halfway expected it on the first tee.  But obviously everyone getting ahead ready for Justin and Tommy to actually go through.  All the way around we had a lot of spectators there.  So, yeah, great experience, it really was.   
 Q.  What was your career round here?  
GREGG PETTERSEN: I've never really had one.  I've never played a tournament here.  There's never been a tournament I've actually played in.   
 Q.  Practise rounds?  
GREGG PETTERSEN: Practise rounds, maybe 3 or 4-under.  But, yeah, that sort of level.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: I've never had one, really.  Being a club professional from when I started off.  I used to play a little bit of competitive golf in the north region, but nothing of any description whatsoever.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: It won't be a lot, 300 pounds.  It won't be an awful of lot at all.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: 15 years.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: Now living in Southport.  I'm originally from St. Helens, half hour away.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: No.  I will, I'll be going back this afternoon, hopefully not like 10:00 last night.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: Jennings.   
 Q.  How old is he?  
GREGG PETTERSEN: 30.  I'm 38.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: Yeah, definitely.  Don't tend to go out like it was yesterday.  But there's been conditions close to that.  The winds can get a little bit higher at times but, yeah, you don't tend to go out.  When you don't have to go out you tend to stay in.   
 Q.  You said there were people out there that you knew watching.  Were there any comments?  
GREGG PETTERSEN: Not particularly, just lots of people wishing me luck.  It was just nice to be out there with people shouting, saying, "Come on.  Play well.  Good shot!"  Things like that.  It was nice all the way around.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: No, it would be hard to say highlights.  I'm married and got two kids.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: If you say golfing, yes, a hundred percent.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: All the way around chatting, just very relaxed and obviously playing fantastic golf, as well, which is nice to see.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: It's one of my best friends, Paul Jones, so he's been -- there's only one person that I was going to ask to do that last night.  His best experience, he's on the golf tour.  He's a pretty good golfer, himself.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GREGG PETTERSEN: He had the heads up that if it happened yesterday afternoon, and, yeah, he's very keen.
