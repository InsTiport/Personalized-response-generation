HARRY ELLIS: With a bit of bad weather tomorrow I can stick in there a little bit and see what happens.   
 Q.  Was it hard to stay positive?  
HARRY ELLIS: I think mentally the last four holes you need to make a score, and I made a good birdie on 15, and I thought I had a good chance coming up the next few, and obviously missing it short at 17, and then finishing with a rubbish bogey on 18 is a little bit disappointing, a little bit of a flat moment, but it's all right.  We're good.   
 Q.  Do you think it puts you out now?  
HARRY ELLIS: You're never out of it.  You saw what happened at the British Amateur.  If I can produce a really good round tomorrow, hopefully some of us struggle and we'll see where we're at.   
 Q.  Are you going to take a break now?  
HARRY ELLIS: Yeah, just a little break, and then just go and clip a few.  Everything is right there.  The short game is good.  Putting felt good, and then just tidy up and get ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
HARRY ELLIS: Yeah, a hundred per cent.  The week so far has been fantastic, and I've loved every minute of it.  There's nothing you can recreate the feeling on the first tee.  I was obviously nervous, but more excited to get the round going, and hit a really good one off the first, which was nice.   
I felt good going in.  It was just one of those things, just a couple of loose shots here and there, but the experience was fantastic.   
 Q.  What's the highlight for you?  
HARRY ELLIS: I think playing with some of the players we see on TV every week.  I've gone from watching TV every week and then being right there with them.  It's surreal when you hear the crowd.  It's a very warming crowd here, so it's great to be with them.  But also like I said before and days before, I feel like I belong here, as well.  I didn't have the best of rounds but I belong here, so it's a great feeling.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
HARRY ELLIS: He turned his round into a 75.  And that's what the best do.  He was kind of struggling a little bit and made two birdies coming in.  And now he's beating me by two shots.  So that's the difference.  They're able to turn their rounds around and keep going.  And Darren finished with two birdies, and all of a sudden it's a 75, which is respectable today.  It's not horrendous.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
HARRY ELLIS: Absolutely.  I mean, you can't help the fact to take something from this experience to prepare me for the next step.  Obviously there's plenty of opportunities to play ahead, and this is the first pro event in a first major; you've got to take the most from it.  I feel like my game is there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
HARRY ELLIS: I've just got to -- like I say, stick to the same plan, but just execute better.  And if I execute the strategy better, hit golf shots, like full 100 percent committed golf shots, then we'll be right there, I know I can produce a score.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
HARRY ELLIS: Always, always.  It's nice.  Obviously we're hear like the American crowd on TV, it's very vocal.  But here it's very warming.  You hit a good shot and you get a good response.  It's a nice feeling.   
I had a good look around.  I took it all in.  It's one of the things when you are playing in this for the first time, the combination of not taking as much in and carrying on and playing the golf course, but also you've got to get the full experience, as well.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
HARRY ELLIS: Yeah, yeah, who knows?  But like I said, just got to get the most from this week now and then see where we're at.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
HARRY ELLIS: Yeah, I mean, obviously they're excited for me.  I think they're more excited for when I go back and play, and obviously looking into 2018, the Masters, and the U.S. Open, obviously I'll still about be in school then, so I think that'll be a good buzz.  But I've had some good messages from them and those boys have obviously seen what I've done, and I think we're going to be competitive next year.  They've sort of learned and seen what I've done, and they realise what they can do, as well.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
HARRY ELLIS: Yeah, Trey checks in every day, I think, for the last three days.  Just a simple message, just a little check-in.  But he knows what I can do and he sees it on a daily basis.  Obviously I'm very thankful for the opportunity he gave me to go to Florida State and I think that's one of the reasons I'm here today.
