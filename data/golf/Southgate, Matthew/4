Q. Wonderful round of 65 on the opening day. You must be pleased with that?
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Chuffed to bits. It's a dream come true really for me. I've waited a long time to go down that last hole with that feeling. A really, really special day for me.
Q. Your best golf on The European Tour has come on links-style golf courses. What is it about this style of play that suits your game the most?
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Just quite versatile, really, with the shot shaping, and I get the feeling that -- short game a bit better. The last few years I've struggled at this event when it gets so cold and I've really struggled because I'm such a feel player. If I lose the feeling in my hands a bit, it's a bit of a nightmare in the knock-down shots but blessed with the weather today.
Just outstanding ball-striking. I hit it exactly where I wanted to off the tee. Got the pace of the greens great and made two really long ones that obviously always help. Didn't really hit a bad shot all day really.
Q. You've been working hard on your game recently and things are turning around for you. Do you feel like this is the start of good things for you on Tour?
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Yeah, I hope so. I mean, I fall in love with the game again, which is great. Everybody has sort of ebbs and flows in their career with that. The last four weeks has been really good for me and I've got stuck into practise like I'm 17 again which great and enjoying every minute of it. A lot clearer in my own head on the golf course. I'm not really worrying about anything, just the shot that's in front of me, and obviously when you get days like today, you can see how effective that is.
