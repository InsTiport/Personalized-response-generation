Q. You're not the first and you won't be the last to make double-bogey at the 18th, after playing so beautifully to get to 3-under; frustrating?
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: It's bad enough when you make a double when you hit a bad shot, let alone when you hit a good one shot.  We had 203 yards into the last there, and I hit 7-iron, just trying to hit to the green, came out like a rocket, and that's golf.  It's not really a lot you can do about that.
I didn't hit a great pitch.  When I dropped, I was really, really disappointed to see the second shot end up the way it did, but I'm sure in about ten minutes time, I'll think about some of the positives and be ready to come back tomorrow.
Q. What's been the strength of the game so far?
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Everything's been really solid.  My iron play has been really good for a few weeks now.  Just keeping things simple.  I feel like the game is sort of really simple at the minute, just picking really small targets, swinging it nice and smooth.  Hitting sort of, not easy shots, but shots I know that are well within my limits.  These sort of seem to keep adding up to good scores.
And obviously qualified for The Open Tuesday at Cinque Ports, and it was the same there.  So I'm obviously coming here with some confidence and hopefully that will stick with me for the weekend and try and take it on Saturday and Sunday.
Q. This will be your second Open Championship.  Just how excited to be going to Troon?
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Yeah, I'm obviously thrilled to bits to be going to Troon.  I grew up playing links golf.  It will be a great week to be involved and I really do feel like my game is in good enough shape to maybe go and do something quite special that week.  I'm just trying to get my game in as good a shape going in there as I possibly can get it.
