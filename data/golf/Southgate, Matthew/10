MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: It's an incredible feeling.  It's difficult to explain.  I get so focused on what I'm doing, that's the next shot, the next hole, the next putt and the next opportunity.  And walking off the 18th tee, I asked my caddie, are we 5-under today?  I didn't know if I was 4, 5 or 6.  I said, that's good.
I'm new to playing in major championships, but I think that's a good sign when you're playing that well on a Sunday, and you don't know what your score is because of your focus.  I think that shows a lot of strength and I'm absolutely thrilled the way I played today.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: I played good golf for three days.  I enjoy playing links golf.  It suits my game really well.  I didn't feel I got the most out of the first three rounds, to really prove a point today and get it around in 65 is great.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: It would be an amazing achievement.  I haven't seen the leaderboard at all, but I think Jordan Spieth is still going well, and full respect for him.
Obviously The Open Championship is always playing special golf, so I'm really looking forward to putting my feet up and watching the rest this afternoon.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Yeah, I think there's one word for that and that's "justice".  I was actually heartbroken to miss it by one shot.  I had a couple of great putts going in on Troon on the back nine.  And I'd be lying to say I haven't lost any sleep over it.  I think I proved the big point with the way I played at Royal Cinq Ports.  I think I had a lot more hunger for this to get into this than anyone else.  I think winning by three is a statement.  I'm glad I did that.  To come out and play this well this week, it proves a lot to me.  This is a special event to me, and we're moving the right direction.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: We're getting there.  I think it's -- I'm not insecure about the way I play golf.  I think it's nice to prove a point, the level you're playing.  And to finish 4th for the Irish Open.  I felt I could go back and achieve something this year, and achieve second.  I felt I achieved something huge.  I think that's the thing, when you set a bar and then you try to raise it and you push and push.  And if you look and keep making the improvements I'm making, sooner or later someone gives you a big old trophy somewhere.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Yes, it's a different attitude.  It was always my dad's dream to play in an Open PGA Championship.  He played at Hoylake and played terrible.  And then with the health problems, he said, I'm not going to get another one.
To qualify for Troon is really special.  And to play well was a bonus.  But this was a more professional performance from me.  This was a lot less sentimental.  Goals were set for the week, there was a game plan set for the week.  We've executed that.  I'll be sitting in the top 10 as it stands.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: It makes no difference to me.  I think the work going into the tournament is to create publicity, and The Open Championship has done that for the itself over the last 145 years.  To not be included in newspaper articles or TV shows, that doesn't bother me.  I know the work I'm putting in and ultimately you put the work in and get the rewards out.  It doesn't bother me to not get in the limelight.
