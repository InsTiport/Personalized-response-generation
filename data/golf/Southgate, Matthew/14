 Q.  Thoughts on that round of 67 today?  
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Just solid the whole day, really.  Sort of found something in my setup today on the driving range and went a bit wider in the stance and more stable.   
Really simple swing thought for the day.  I was really striking the ball nice and that obviously helps with the distance control as we hit up loads of chances, and obviously a great round of 67.   
 Q.  How are the greens?  
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: I think they are putting well.  They might spike up a bit this afternoon.  Obviously that will level out as we play tomorrow afternoon.  But you can definitely hole putts.  They are a good speed.  There are some tricky flags to be fair, but no, they are pretty good spot from 20 feet, so you can still make birdie.   
 Q.  Only one bogey out there today, so that must be a good sign.  
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Yeah, it was really good.  We had sort of a rough half hour out there.  Sort of played two holes back-to-back not very well and ended up just dropping the one shot.  That was good.  Kept the damage limitation and then picked 1-up straight afterwards.  That was good for me, yeah.   
 Q.  Overall, looking forward to the rest of the week?  
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE: Yeah, definitely.  Set up nicely now.  That's the best opening round I've had for a long time and I felt like there's been good golf coming.  Looking forward to getting some work done this afternoon and getting out there tomorrow.
