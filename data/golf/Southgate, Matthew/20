  MATTHEW SOUTHGATE:     Everything seemed to click into place really.   I've had so many chances and holed the good shots really good and there wasn't many bad shots that we needed to recover from, so I just took advantage of the really good shots and set up plenty of them.   So it was quite an enjoyable round really.   
   
 Q.   No particular sense of this in your recent results, nothing to suggest you're going to play this well; have you felt it coming?   
MATTHEW SOUTHGATE:   It's been coming for a long time, yeah.   It's been a tough season, and you know, coming out of Tour School, you're playing to make cuts, really, which is a bit negative, but the biggest thing is to get through to the weekend.   
So I feel like I've been playing the last few weeks looking over my shoulder the whole time rather than just concentrating on a fourâ€‘round tournament and getting into contention and competing against some of these players.   
It has been coming and I've been doing a lot of work on my putting.   Robert Rock has helped me out a lot with my putting and Henry from Titleist and Scotty Cameron has helped me with my putting.   It's something I've focused on.   I'm not hitting the ball any different, just setting up as many chances as normal and converting a few of them to make the scores.
