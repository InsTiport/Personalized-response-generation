 Q.  A Brandon, a 65, how was that?  
BRANDON STONE: It was great.  Left one or two out there coming home.  Overall, very happy with the round.   
 Q.  Best round of the week so far.  What's the difference out there today?  
BRANDON STONE: The conditions were just spectacular.  I think any time you get the old lady with a slight breeze like you did today with the sun shining, it's an honour and luckily I took advantage of it today and hopefully I can do the same tomorrow.   
 Q.  Your last final round on a links course, 60 at Gullane, how can you use that for your advantage tomorrow?  
BRANDON STONE: With what the weather is expected to be tomorrow, I'll sign for it now if you're offering it.  I'm obviously not just thinking it's going to happen.  It's going to be quite tricky tomorrow going off a little early because of the forecasted high winds.  Hopefully I can do more of what I did today.  Played solid, putted beautifully and signed for a good score.
