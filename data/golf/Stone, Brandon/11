Q. Your reflections on today's round, please?
BRANDON STONE: Yeah, I played solid.  Only made one bogey on the par 3, a little bit of a wayward shot but other than that it was a fun day out there.  Tricky conditions with the breeze kicking up, and I'm happy to sign with the best round of the week for me.
Q. Your second time in this event.  Are you starting to figure it out out there?
BRANDON STONE: Yeah, I think this golf course is one of them, you need to play a few times, get a little course knowledge you can take with the green, the grain especially, and a few tee shots here and there.
But it's an incredible place.  I mean, the Emirates Golf Club really is in superb condition for us this week and it's been a lot of fun.
Q. Give us an idea of what you've done really well this week.
BRANDON STONE: I think I did most things quite well.  I think I drove the ball, the irons are good and the swing felt really good and solid all week.  Holed a lot of good putts inside five feet.  Didn't make as many as you need to win from outside that range, but overall very happy with the game.  Yeah, looking forward to the next few weeks.
Q. You must be still full of confidence going into the rest of the season, aren't you?
BRANDON STONE: A hundred percent.  I've got a couple weeks off to improve on where the game might have been lacking a bit and come back for Joburg Open, and then we'll see what we can do.
