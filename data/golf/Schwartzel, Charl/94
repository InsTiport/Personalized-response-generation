Q.   Six birdies and three bogeys, how do you feel about the way you played today? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I mean, overall score is a good score but the way I did it was disappointing.   I had a chance to really get myself up there.   My putter dropped me on the back nine, and I left myself quite a long way back and making life very difficult on myself.

Q.   You're making a bunch of birdies, if you go out tomorrow and make a bunch, you can make a big run?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I need to, but I need to play more solid.   There's no point in making a bunch of birdies followed with bogeys.   I'm missing a lot of short putts and I need to sharpen up on that and hopefully make a bunch of birdies with no bogeys, that will be the idea.
