 Q. How did the course play? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I mean, I didn't think 67 was out there today at the beginning of the day with the wind as strong as it was. You know, like I said early on, I made five birdies, which I thought you could do. You know, especially with three par 5s being downwind, and some of them you're hitting wedge. 
 The big achievement for me today was not making any bogeys. That kept the scorecard very clean. 

 Q. Is this as well as you've ever played in your whole career?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I've started off the year so good, and I couldn't have asked for any better. You know, it feels like it's still with me, the way I played in the beginning of the year. It really feels good. You know, I've got a lot of confidence with the way I'm playing right now, I'm striking the ball well, and you know, I'm also making a few putts, which is all adds up to good golf.

 Q. Been overtaken on The Race to Dubai, be nice to get back on top this week?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, with Ian's win at the Match Play, he went up front. But I'm in good position, and it will be nice to overtake him again. 

 Q. A no-bogey round in any tournament is good, but when the wind is swirling around like it is today, how good is a no-bogey round? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: You know, I played a lot of good rounds in my career, and yeah, this one rates right up there. It could even be at the top. It was difficult. You couldn't mess a shot. You miss a shot on this course, as we've seen -- I just saw Robert Allenby, I didn't know he finished 4-under. He was playing some really good golf. But that's what can happen on this golf course. There's so much trouble out there, especially with this type of wind. 
 I was playing good golf, and I'm three shots behind. So that was -- he must have made a whole bunch of putts and made some real will I good golf.
