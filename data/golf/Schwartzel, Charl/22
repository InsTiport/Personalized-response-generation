 Q.  Walk us through what, at least in our minds, is a very good week.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, my mind, too.  Yeah, I played well.  This morning was just a horrific start, which I thought wasn't such a bad tee shot.  Got up in the wind and hit someone in the head on the first hole, and the ball went into the bush unplayable, and the poor guy was lying there.  It was just not quite what I envisioned.  I felt sorry for the guy, and so I was a bit rattled from the start.   
Just really happy that I sort of got it back, because it's easy from there, with that sort of thing happening, you could lose it.  So I'm very pleased with the amount of birdies I made.  I putted well and kept it together.   
 Q.  And you have kept it together very well, so much so that even into the latter stages, presumably you thought there was a chance.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: There was.  When I birdied ten, I knew the back nine there was a lot of opportunity for birdies, and the bogey on 11 was a real hit in the stomach.  That sort of stopped it a bit.  But still, good finish and maybe one on 14, a bad shot on 16, and 18 is always a good birdie.   
 Q.  Looking back on The European Tour season, do you think, this is pretty sweet?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: With the amount of tournaments I played, I played very minimal this year, I think I played really well, and I enjoy playing Europe.  It's been one of the places where I started my career, and you know, it nice to come back.   
A week off and then we'll see you guys at Leopard Creek.
