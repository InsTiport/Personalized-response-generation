Q.   How did it go out there today?   You're plus 2 with two to play, right?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I am. 

Q.   How was the course today as far as the setup between yesterday and today?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Pretty much the same. 

Q.   Pins were tough?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Pins are tough, but there was a few tough ones yesterday too and then obviously there was a few easier ones today, so. 

Q.   A little bit windier today?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   A little windier, different direction too.   So it made different calculations on different holes.   So it wasn't too difficult to adapt to. 
I made a whole bunch of birdies, but my bogeys were really stupid bogeys.
