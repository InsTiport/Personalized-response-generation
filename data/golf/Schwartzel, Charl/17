CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I suppose match play, this is what it's all about.  You go through and you win every single match, you will end up winning this tournament.  For me, it's going to be the case.  There's no slipping through.   
 Q.  Are you a big match play fan?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I wouldn't say I'm the biggest of fans of it.  My record is not that great.  I'm learning.  Every year that this has gone by, I've learned something about it.   
 Q.  What is the hardest thing to do to keep match play discipline?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: The hardest thing to do is not to play the guy you are playing against it.  Just to play the game.  I find that difficult.  I find I start to focus on what he does.  You start hitting shots that you would never hit in normal circumstances.   
 Q.  At least you have a very clear picture tomorrow.  There's several things.  You would both have two points.  You could halve and go extra time or one of you win and go through.  It's amazing how complex it can get.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I know.  At the end of the day, this is a good position to be in.  You know what you have to do.  If you win, you win.
