 Q.   Here with Charl Schwartzel.   You shot a 65 yesterday, 69 today.   Still a good number.   What was the difference between today and yesterday?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I think the difference was pretty much 11 and 12 today.   
I was playing pretty solid golf.   I was 3 under through 10.   Had a really short one on 11 and a pretty makable one on 12, and I missed it, where yesterday I was making them.   It sort of kills the momentum.   
Then left the ball putt short on 14.   Felt like you're going to 5 under for the day, then you're back at 2.   To top it off, the threeâ€‘putt on 17.   Not a great finish at the end there, but I don't think it's much damage done.   It's still two days to go.  
   
 Q.   You still are in the mix as you head into the weekend.   A bit of a change tomorrow with tee times now 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. because of the weather.   Because of that change, is it a difficult adjustment for you?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It's really interfering with my sleep.   I don't think it affects me much.   
The ball on this golf course in the morning will go a little shorter, where this course will play a little longer.   Probably only the first nine holes and then back to normal.   Don't think it will make much difference.
