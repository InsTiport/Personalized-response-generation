 Q.   What a difference 24 hours can make.   What was different in your mind today?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I went to sleep and never hit a ball again before I teed off.   Just walked straight to the tee.   I can't win this tournament 3‑putting like I am.   I'm hitting the ball well enough but I need to start making the putts.   
   
 Q.   The leader yesterday got off to a very fast start and things seem to be bunching up on the weekend?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, it's not a walk over‑‑ but if you hit the ball good, you can make a lot of birdies.   Looks like a couple of guys got off to a bad start, which can happen, and others obviously got off to a good start.   You pretty much can't think about what the other guys are doing, because some holes are quite hard.   You have to keep making your birdies, and I don't think the scoring will be too low.   
   
 Q.   Is the golf course soft enough, do you think, for you to really attack?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Well, it certainly was when I teed off this morning.   If you hit good iron shots into the greens, the way the balls were stopping‑‑ I think if the greens get firm, it's going to become a whole different ballgame.   
   
 Q.   How did you enjoy playing with the Amateurs?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   We had loads of fun.   I think he's the best amateur I've had for a very, very long time.   He played really good golf.   I thought we were going to win it at 15‑under.   
   
 Q.   But you're not sure now?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   No.   The guys are on 14‑under, quite a lot of holes to go.   You have par 5s coming in.   With the professionals playing with, I don't think we will win now.  
   
 Q.   But you enjoyed the format, a nice change?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It's nice that we have something to play for there.   We had lots of fun.
