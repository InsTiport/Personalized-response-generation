Q. Nice 68 today. Just how would you assess your round out there?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, very solid. We had really, really good conditions today. The greens were still a little bit receptive, so I thought it was a really good chance of making a good score.
And I hit the ball beautiful. I drove it really good and gave myself a lot of chances.
Towards the end I hit two not so great shots, but managed to save par and that's what I into needed to do.

Q. You obviously know how to close on a Sunday here. Do you feel like you put yourself in contention to get yourself another Green Jacket tomorrow?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, yeah, for sure. This back nine at Augusta really just gives itself to really a lot of birdies and a lot of drama. 
So, where I am now, I'm definitely within a shot and if I keep swinging like I am, you never know, you get on a run and you can make a scare up on the board.

Q. What do you think you have to do tomorrow to put that scare into them, to kind of climb yourself up on the leaderboard and then truly into contention?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Probably what I did last time. Shoot 66 and finish with four birdies in a row, which would work. 

Q. You must be smiling. You are smiling. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: What's not to smile about after that? 

Q. Thoughts on the round?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, today was obviously a lot easier conditions than what we have had the first two days. The greens I thought were still quite receptive for Augusta standards. I'm sure tomorrow they're going to show their teeth, but there was a good score to be made out there.
You still needed to hit the ball in play and I did that. I drove it very well. A few loose iron shots here and there, but managed to save those pars. And that's what I needed to keep going, I played the parâ€‘5s beautiful. So, I gave myself a chance for tomorrow.
