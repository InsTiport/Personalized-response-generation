  CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Scoring is really low.   If you're not making birdies, then you're going backwards out there.   Golf course like this, playing soft, the five par 5s, I think this week you're going to have been quite a bit into the 20‑unders.

Q.   Have you made a conscious shift and mind‑set as you get out there and play?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, I was pretty prepared from the start.   I thought that you would have to shoot 7‑under every time you go out there with all the par 5s, if the weather stays like it does today. 

Q.   You birdied 11 and 12, and have to leave, at that point did you feel like you want to keep playing?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Quite nice to keep playing after a run of birdies.   But it was getting really dark, and it was getting difficult to see some of the lines, so I was happy to finish with those two birdies.

Q.   Could be a long‑ish day of golf tomorrow.   What's your mind‑set going into the second round? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Well, I've had a lot of practise on the PGA TOUR with these long days, so pretty prepared for it.
