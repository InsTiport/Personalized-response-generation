 Q.  How is your form ending today and through the week?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: You know, I thought the only real positive this week for me was my -- that I stayed very patient.  I didn't particularly play very well.  Putted nicely.  So you know, those are two key things that can really spark you going forward.  I just need to find my long game.   
 Q.  Drivers in particular?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Everything.  It's the golf swing.  The golf swing's not doing very well and I had a really bad back this week, so maybe that's a factor.   
At least my putting feels good, because that's normally where you score, so if I can find the long game, then I could do well the next few events.   
 Q.  What will you do, go back to South Africa to practice?  You're not playing Turkey, are you?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: No, I'm not playing Turkey.  Hopefully we can get something done, and it could be something really small.
