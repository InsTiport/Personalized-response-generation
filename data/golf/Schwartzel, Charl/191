   CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  67 out there today was a very good score I thought.  Especially making a bogey, felt like my play was really solid.  I hit a lot of fairways, all the greens. 

 Q.  Very tricky conditions, as well, you didn't expect the weather to be quite as cold as this in Qatar? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  Not in the desert, I wasn't expecting it.  Like this morning, I had four layers of clothing on.  It was cold.  But you've got to cope with it and I'm working with a new coach, Jamie Gough now from South Africa, and yeah, swing feels very good. 

 Q.  Jamie must be pretty happy because he's got you and Anton as new clients. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  I think he is smiling. 

 Q.  Feeling like the rust is out of the way with a few tournaments under your belt? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  We didn't have much of a break during December.  I had two weeks between Ernie's event and the Joburg Open.  So I wasn't that rusty starting off in Joburg.  But you know, I wasn't playing that well. 
 It's definitely slowly feeling like it's turning, you know.  I'm starting to hit the ball the way I see it and I'm putting well.  Changed my grip and it's just rolling really. 

 Q.  So now you just want to keep rolling with it? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  Yeah, I've got quite a busy time ahead.  I'm going and playing Dubai and I'll go back home and play the last two events on the Sunshine Tour and probably come out again before Johnnie Walker in Malaysia, and then a bit of a break after that. 

 Q.  Are you when somebody that says it's the new year, 2008, got to set new goals and new resolutions, that sort of thing? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  Obviously it's a new year, you set yourself some new goals.  I dropped a bit in my World Ranking, and I would really like to get back into that Top-50, even Top-64 for now to get into the Match Play.  So that's the short-term goal. 

 Q.  Concentrating on Europe and Sunshine Tour, as well? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  I think I'm going to play Europe -- I'll play the last two events on the Sunshine Tour but mostly Europe.
