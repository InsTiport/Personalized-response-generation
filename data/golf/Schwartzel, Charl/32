Q. Tough match.  You really gutted it out at the end.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, at one stage I was playing really solid, and it was sort of felt like I was in control of the game.
Danny made a really good comeback, made a few birdies on the back nine.  Then it felt like we both start playing a little scrappy and just really hanging in there by the skin of our teeth.  I'm just happy that I hit some good shots coming in.
Q. Your win at Valspar has to give you so much confidence coming into this week?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It does.  Any win you get, it boosts your confidence by so much.  Just having some good fun here.
Q. Tell me about your shot on 17.  It seemed like you took a lot of time over the ball and then you hit it stiff.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: You know, it's just -- it would always be a little 9-iron with the wind, but just having adrenaline pumping you wouldn't normally go for the wedge.  I wasn't sure about the wind.  The wedge normally go too high.  I was just really scared if I do hit it, it's just going to hang.  I was contemplating will I get it there or not.  I just went with a little nine at the end and it worked out.
Q. Ended up being the shot that determined the match.  Nice job.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I think so.  I think that shot put some pressure on.  It looked like -- it's just nice to hit some good shots when you need to.
