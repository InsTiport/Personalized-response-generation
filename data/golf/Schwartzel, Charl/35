Q. 5-under today, how did that feel?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Felt pretty good.  It's a tough golf course.  Any time you shoot in the 60s, I think you're doing well.  Yeah, I feel maybe the wind direction suited me a little better today.  There's a few holes that played easier that normally is a bit difficult on this golf course.
I played pretty flawless.
Q. Puts you in great position for the weekend.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It is.  There's a lot of good players up on that board, and I'm halfway now, so it's going to take some good golf.  Going to have to shoot another two rounds in the 60s, in the mid 60s.
Q. Scoring has never been this low for awhile, has it.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, it's because of the wind.  The wind's not nearly as strong as it normally is, and like I said, the direction is also making some of the holes a lot easier than what they normally are.
