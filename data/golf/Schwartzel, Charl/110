  JIM NANTZ:   Bubba, just an amazing day out there.   I don't know where to start, but why don't you tell us about the shot you hit down on the 10th hole.   
BUBBA WATSON:   I was there earlier today during regulation so I was used to it.   I knew what I was facing there.   Had a good lie, had a gap where I had to hook it, I don't know, 40 yards or something.   So I just‑‑ I'm pretty good at hooking it, so I just hooked it up there and somehow it nestled close to the hole.  
JIM NANTZ:   A special Easter for you.   I know how much it means to you to win on this day, and I also know how much these last few weeks have meant to you to be a father and to be in this position.   How do you put it into words?   
BUBBA WATSON:   (Tearing up) I never got this far in my dreams, to talk.   It's a blessing.   I mean, to go home to my new son, it's going to be fun.   
JIM NANTZ:   Caleb and Angie I know were on your mind all day today.   
BUBBA WATSON:   Yeah, for sure.  
JIM NANTZ:   Just trying to keep your mind around where this competition is going, how did you do it, how did you keep hanging in there throwing birdies at everybody?   
BUBBA WATSON:   After my playing partner, Louis, made double eagle on 2 and he took the lead that quick, I three‑putted the first hole, I just kept my head down knowing that there were birdies on the back nine.   You could make some eagles, you could make some birdies.   A couple hole‑in‑ones already on 16, so I knew that was a possibility.   I just kept going, kept grinding it out, and somehow I went into a playoff, and I don't know what happened the rest.   I just know I was crying a little bit later.   That's about it.   
JIM NANTZ:   The green jacket, did you ever dream that big?   
BUBBA WATSON:   No, I never have.  
BILLY PAYNE:   Charl, if you'll please do the honor.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Bubba, well done.   Congratulations.   You are truly blessed.   Well played.   
BILLY PAYNE:   Bubba, congratulations.   Very proud of you.   
BUBBA WATSON:   This is nice.   I look like you now.
