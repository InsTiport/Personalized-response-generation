 Q.   How do you feel about the round and your position going forward?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Today was definitely by far the hardest day we have had out of the three days.   I got off to a flying start, hit the ball beautifully, made some good putts.   Just unfortunate, a bit of a wait we had on 11.   I just made a poor shot that ended up costing me a double‑bogey.   
But fortunately I got off to a good start, so still in the mix and held on strong to the finish with a birdie on the last.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the last four holes when the wind was really ripping across the water out there.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It was strong.   It was one thing to get the ball on the putting surface and it was another to actually putt.     I felt it was moving me around a little bit on the greens.   It was tough.   It was a big challenge coming in.  
   
 Q.   Doesn't move the big guys; just the little guys.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Exactly.   I need to put on some weight.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts going into tomorrow?   They have adjusted the tee times obviously in case some weather comes in in the afternoon.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   The same.   I've been playing so good the whole week.   The only downside are my doubles.   I've made a few big numbers but I'm making the birdies.   Go out there and probably going to have to shoot 5‑under par or something to be in with a chance.
