 Q. You've had two of the best American match play players in Furyk and Mahan, how good does that feel?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: That is a pretty good feeling. 
 Obviously going out today, playing against Jim, he's such a good player, and you can see it. He was never going to make any mistakes. 
 And I knew he wasn't going to give me holes. I'm going to have to make birdies. 

 Q. No bogeys on your card. There's almost no one else out there with no bogeys, what was the key to that?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: The greens are so severe, I was hitting into the fairways, and hitting really good iron shots in the right places. 
 And it comes down to placing your iron shots on these greens.

 Q. How does form affect the way you attack the golf course? Does that mean you go at more flags than you normally would?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's such a good golf course. Fortunately for me, I've been striking it really good. Yesterday was a little iffy, but I found something on the range, and I did really good today.

 Q. Do you feel like you can beat anyone in this form? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Sure. Going against Jim, I don't think it could get much better, he's such a focused and solid player. If you make birdies, you're going to beat the guys.
