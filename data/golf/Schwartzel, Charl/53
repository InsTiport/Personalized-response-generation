 Q.   You dodged a couple of bullets and made a great 2 out here on the 20th hole?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, and I didn't play very well the first ten holes.   I gave him two holes, and on top of it he hit some really good shots.   And he pretty much played the way he's been playing the last few months, except he didn't take advantage of all the putts that he had.   And then I just caught fire on the last six or seven holes.   And that's pretty much what I had to do to beat him.   He was never going to give it to me.   
   
 Q.   I wasn't sure that birdie putt you stroked on the 18th hole was going to get to the cup.   It seemed like it rolled in just on the final revolution.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Now, if Dustin had won this match, he would with have won all the tieâ€‘breakers, and automatically moved into the round of 16.   You said you computed all that while the match was in progress so you knew what was going on?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   We were very conscious of it.   
So, yeah, I knew if I didn't beat him then that was it, you know.   I think that's what made the win a little bit harder.
