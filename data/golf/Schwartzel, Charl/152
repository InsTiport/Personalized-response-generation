  Q. Charl, it was a great round of golf out there, is that a fair assessment from your point of view?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yes, I felt like I played really well. I was hitting the ball very good.   
 The back nine, my first nine, was pretty spectacular ball-striking, and I probably hit my worst iron shot on No. 3, and I hit a bomb of a putt. And all of a sudden things got going. I kept giving myself chances and stayed patient and got my little run.  
  
  Q. Talk about the way the course is playing today. Is it as attackable as you think this course can be under the conditions?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It was tough. We had a little bit more wind than what we've had in the practice rounds, which does play quite a bit of effect. But I did think -- I was saying to my caddie that I drove it well, so I felt like I was giving myself good chances. I think that's a big key. I was in the fairway and I actually felt like I could make a good score.  
  
  Q. How important is it in a USGA type of a setup to find yourself not having to make up ground, getting off to a strong start like this, what does it enable you to do going into the second round and subsequent rounds?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's always -- it's a long way to go. But it's nice to get yourself in contention. It makes your work almost less. If you start falling too far behind on a tough golf course, things can get a little bit too far in front of you. So you need to stay in there with a chance. Like I said, it's a long way to go.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It does. It's nice to know that you've got one in the bucket. No reason to stop there, see if we can get a few more.
