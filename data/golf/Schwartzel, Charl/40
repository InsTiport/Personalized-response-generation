Q. Charl, 1-up through 6 in this match and things changed pretty quickly.  What's your assessment of how it all played out?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I think it was an awesome match.  Obviously didn't want to come out on that side of it, but Jordan by himself was 8-under through 14.  As a team they were 9-under.
We were 6, so I think that's a really good match.  You can't really do anything when there is good golf played.
Q. It got dark here very quickly.  How much thought was given to stopping, and why did you guys continue to finish this one out?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, you know, I think for us it was going to be basically our only chance to really pull it back in, especially in four ball with the wind still up and maybe guys can't see.
Took a chance that Jordan can't see.  Maybe he'll miss the putt.  (Laughter.)
