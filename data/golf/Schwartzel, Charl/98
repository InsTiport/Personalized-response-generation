Q.   You'd better talk about that finish because for the first time this week, it was an achievement.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I was happy, I've hit such great shots into 18 the last four days, and I think the only day that I missed the green, I made birdie.   The days I hit it, I made pars. 
So for me it was just a big achievement to 2‑putt the last for birdie.   Pretty happy about that.   But overall it's a great day, I put four good rounds together and that's what I have not been doing all year.   So you know, that's a good step. 

Q.   And you almost for got your scorecard as a result? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, you know, I was just happy to come in here and 2‑putt the last.   I didn't even think about where my scorecard was.

Q.   But when that was signed, it's good for probably third position or fourth at the very least. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, we'll see.   Whatever it finishes, it's still nice to be able to hit the ball well and swing the club good.   You know, I take the amount of putts that I missed, if I can fix that up, I can definitely be winning tournaments.

Q.   But the key thing is consistency; you've managed to score decently every single day to give yourself the opportunity?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   That's the whole key.   You look at the guys that week‑in, week‑out they are there, it's what they do.   You know, that's the whole key is just to be able to putt four rounds together every week. 

Q.   Do you have an appreciation of those just ahead of you, 62 for Justin Rose and great finish from Rory?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Amazing.   I was just saying, Rory is playing golf probably like Tiger did in his young days, and it's actually amazing to see.   To watch it and even Justin coming up shooting 62, just shows you how strong golf is.
