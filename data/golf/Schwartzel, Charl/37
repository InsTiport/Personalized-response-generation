 Q.  Overall thoughts, you got off to a nice start today?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, I played very nicely for most of the day.  The only hiccup was the 3-putt on 16 and 17, but other than that, it was a pretty solid round.   
 Q.  What changed?  Did you change your game plan at all with the softer conditions out there this morning?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I guess you could be just a little bit more aggressive.  We normally pitch the ball a little short; you could pitch it at the hole now.  So it made it a little easier.  But off the tee, still the same stuff.   
 Q.  Did it play a little longer than usual?  I know it doesn't play that long normally.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Maybe a little bit, but nothing significant.
