Q.   Did you have a number in mind?   Pretty well set up for tomorrow. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Not necessarily.   I don't have a number.   I mean, you never know what a good number is.   There's quite a bit of breeze out there. 

Q.   How tough is it playing? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   If there's no wind, it's not that difficult.   Obviously the wind, you have crosswind, and if it comes up the way it is now, it's a challenge. 
It's going to set up for us‑‑ hopefully keep it going.
