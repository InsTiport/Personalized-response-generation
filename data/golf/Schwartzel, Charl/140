 Q. Charl, you must have enjoyed it out there, beautiful weather, lovely course, good company?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's nice to play this golf course in weather like this. I don't think you get to do that often. 
 It was fun. I enjoyed it. I played -- I had a good time with my dad and Ernie and his dad. We had a great time. Would have liked a few more putts to go in between a few of us, but all in all, good. 

 Q. How did your dad play? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: He helped me on a lot of holes. I don't think -- he's not playing his best. But we were dovetailing well. So maybe we can get something going at St. Andrews tomorrow.

 Q. Nice to play with Ernie, as well, since you two are so close and know each other so well. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, it's always nice to play with Ernie. He's such a good ball-striker, and it's always fun. 

 Q. Looking forward to St. Andrews tomorrow now?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, St. Andrews is nice, I'm hoping for something similar to this and we can shoot a low score.
