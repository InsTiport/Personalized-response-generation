Q. Defending champion finishing the week off in style, a 68.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: 17, I hit 7-iron, and it looked good for a long way but I didn't think it was going to be this particularly good.
18, I hit 3-wood and 9-iron to the top shelf and hit a beautiful putt.  It's nice to come back and at least have a good go at your December.
Q. We talked yesterday about the feelings and vibe coming back, but to get as close as you did, you mentioned that was frustrating for you today, but overall has been a good defense?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I played really well this week.  This week I think compared to last week was easier.  I was two shots better and I'm finishing two shots better this year than last year, and finishing sixth.
Q. We talked yesterday about coming off the injury, you haven't played a huge amount.  How ready are you feeling for a big stretch?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's nice to be fresh and especially at this stage of our schedule.  I've got the Masters and the Match Play, also, coming up.  I think I've got a bit of advantage over the guys that's played a lot this year, and especially starting to show some good results.
