Q.   Tough out there today? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It was a lot harder an the other days.     It was also a lot firmer, the greens were faster, and I'm happy with the score I put together.

Q.   What was the difficult part out there?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Well, like I said, the course got a bit firmer, and you know, playing in the last few groups, obviously the greens get a bit more bumpy.   So it's hard to make birdies and also to keep the bogeys off the card.   You need all aspects going to be on song. 

Q.   What's your thoughts going into tomorrow? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It's easy to make bogeys.   I probably won't change anything.   Just keep playing the way I am and see if I can give myself chances and see what happens.   I know the game is good enough to be able to win tomorrow. 

Q.   Getting off to a fast start overseas at the start of the year, is that just carrying over? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I hope so.   I've had a good run and been consistent, just see if we can keep going with it. 

Q.   How good was that round considering how difficult this course seemed to be playing? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It was really good.   It was a lot tougher today than the other days.   The course firmed up a lot.   The greens are getting firm and bouncy, and it becomes hard to get the ball close to make birdies and even to keep the bogeys off the card.   You need to be on song with your whole game. 

Q.   Three back heading into the final round, what's the game plan to chase down Bill Haas? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I mean, you know, the way I'm playing, I don't think I'll change anything.   I'll just keep going along, and like I said, the course is tough, and it's easy to make mistakes.   We'll see.   If I can keep giving myself chances, I'm bound to shoot a decent score, and we'll see what Bill does.
