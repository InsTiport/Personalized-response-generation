Q. You have to be pleased with the round of even par today.CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, I think any time you're going to shoot even par around this golf course you can be happy about it. You can see they must have been watering the greens a little bit last night and maybe throughout the round a bit, because they were actually really nice to play on.  I thought that they were still tough, but yet fair. I think that another three level par rounds might not be that far off at the end of the day.  So I'm pleased with the way it went.
Q. Anything in particular about your game you're most pleased with?CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I think the game wasn't as sharp as it's been, to be honest but I just think that what was a very positive, a good positive is the way I kept hanging in there and grinding out some nice pars and took opportunities when I did hit a good shot to make a birdie.  So I think that was a positive part about the round.
