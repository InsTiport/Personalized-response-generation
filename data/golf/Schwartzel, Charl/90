Q.   Comment on the even par seventh today, if you can.   How it went for you out there. 
CHARLES SCHWARTZEL:   It was a bit up and down out there.   Hit a few bad shots off the fairway and the putter was pretty much‑‑ bit of a frustrating day but I suppose it's the mix. 

Q.   Definitely different conditions from what you saw yesterday morning to this afternoon, was it a good bit windier? 
CHARLES SCHWARTZEL:   I didn't think it was that much windier, I think it played that much tougher.   The greens were a bit more bumpy, the grass seems to be a little longer.   Uphill putts actually become a little more difficult and it means you have to hit them harder and it tends to bounce off line. 
That's the only thing that I found a bit more difficult.   But the fact that the wind blew, you know, it blew the ball a little bit further.
