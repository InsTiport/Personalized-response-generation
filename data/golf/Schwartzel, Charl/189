   CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Felt like I played really well all week. Got off to a great start birdieing the second and third and had a poor 3-putt on four but recovered well and birdied six and then a couple on the back nine so, 12-under, in good shape.   
  
  Q. The closing few birdies, they have given you a chance tomorrow, albeit Martin is flying ahead at the moment, isn't he?   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, it's definitely put me up there, and all of us know, it's a strange game, so I'm not too bothered by him. He's obviously playing really well. I'll have to shoot quite a low one tomorrow. If I can get to 20-under, I think I'll be close, but you never know what is going to happen.  
  
  Q. Tell us about your new caddie on the bag, your brother. How is he getting on out there?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Actually it's fantastic. We're having a good time. My caddie actually caddies for me all the time, Justice, his mother passed away a few weeks ago and he's taking some time off. My brother, he's turning professional at the beginning of the year and is playing on the Sunshine Tour and he's gotten weeks off now. So I said come out for two weeks and caddie.  
  
  Q. Nice having him on the bag?   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, I'm enjoying it and we're going to have a good time.  
  
  Q. How will you approach tomorrow, be as aggressives you can?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: The way the course is setting up, there's a couple holes that you can't go at the flag. I'll just do the same that I've done all week. I felt like I played the course really well so far, and if you're shooting low scores, you're going to hole some putts. So if you knock in the putts tomorrow, you could get a low one out there.
