 Q.   Charl, 7‑under for the tournament, 3‑under for the day.   Give us the evaluation on the round today.   Maybe a little bit better scoring conditions as far as the wind was concerned, the absence of rain?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, definitely wasn't as strong as yesterday.   There was lots of birdies out there but the course is still playing difficult, and you have to give yourself chances to make birdies.   I played pretty solid.   I thought I hit a lot of good putts that could have gone in.   3‑under is a solid round of golf and I'm still in the tournament.  
   
 Q.   You have a pretty good history here, second place back in 2010.   How much do you rely on those experiences and memories from previous events on this course?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, it gives you obviously a bit of confidence knowing that you've done well on this golf course.   It's a course that suits my eye.   When I go out there, I feel comfortable with it.   I think that also plays a role.   
   
 Q.   7‑under, right in the mix there as far as the leaderboard is concerned.   Give us the attack plan for the weekend.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I mean, in this game you can't force anything.   Like I said I'm playing well and giving myself opportunities, and hopefully some of those good putts I'm hitting will start going in and get a little bit of a low round going.   
  
   
 Q.   Any birdies stand out today?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I didn't make a putt over seven feet, so none that stand out right now.   I birdied three of the par 5s, and the other two par 5s were little 6‑footers.
