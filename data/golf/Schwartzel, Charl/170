 Q. 2-under par 68; that's as tough of a day as golf as I've seen this year on the PGA TOUR?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's my first TOUR event so far this year, and, you know, welcome to the PGA TOUR. It was really tough. 
 It was tough out there and I really feel like I controlled my ball flight and was able to just hang in there. Played really well.

 Q. Second last year at Doral at the Cadillac, the World Golf Championship; you're used to playing in difficult conditions, because it does blow at Doral. The yardage book, the yardage today; this the kind of day that you just toss it away and just strictly play by feel?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, definitely. I mean, the yardage book is just a guideline at this stage. This is where I feel back in South Africa when I growing up, playing without yardage; it was just looking at shots, feeling shots, is where this plays a big role. It's so much feel, and like I said, it's just a guideline for every yardage.

 Q. Stuart Appleby said earlier that he thought putting was the most difficult. How about yourself?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Definitely. I mean, putting, as everyone knows, if you're moving around, you can't hit the ball on line. The wind pushes you all over. Once again, it becomes a feel thing. A line is not a line anymore. You have got to get hit the wind, as well, and it makes it very difficult.
