  Q. 1-under par for today, same result as yesterday, you got it to 12-under par; how did you feel about your round today?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I felt it was solid, playing well through 12 holes, and then a good finish could have changed things around. No, very unfortunate on 13, ended up making double. That was a hard one to swallow.   
  
  Q. How are your expectations for tomorrow?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I played solid all the way till 12, so there's nothing really wrong. Just need to hit the ball slightly better. Some of the guys can shoot a low one, and Martin is playing well.   
  
  Q. 1-under for your round today?   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I played really decent all the way up until 12. I was 3-under and it was very unfortunate that I ended up with a ball in the bush and making six. That putts a halt to things very quickly, especially when Martin is applying so well. He's going to be very difficult to catch.   
 He's just playing so good. He doesn't look like he's making any mistakes and when he does make one, he recovers so well. So you know, I don't know, probably have to shoot at least 8-under tomorrow, and hopefully he just has an average day.   
  
  Q. Is it quite disconcerting playing with him when he's playing like that and you're trying to keep up?   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It wasn't all the way. Up until 12, I was really right in it. Who knows, if I miss the putt, but things could have changed in the round and maybe I could have made two or three birdies and been only three behind or so.   
 But that's how this game goes. It's such a fine line between playing really well and just average.
