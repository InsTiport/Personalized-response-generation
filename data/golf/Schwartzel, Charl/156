 Q. Comment on the day? Just one of those -- two of those days that just went wrong for you?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Never been on a golf course with so many things going wrong. I mean, I don't know, the first hole, I hit it straight down the fairway, down the left side which is the side to hit it down and it bounces left instead of right and stops an inch short of the bunker, I can't even chip it out. I can't stand to chip it out and I've just hit a perfect tee shot. 
 And then hits the lip and comes back and it plugs.

 Q. Even that early, you're thinking, this is not my day?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I went out and I thought if I can shoot 4-under or so, I've got a chance, and I think it would have been fine. But no, nothing went. Just as soon as I hit a good shot, I didn't get rewarded for it and hit a bad shot, you got really penalised. 
 You know, I haven't missed many cuts in the last three years, just one of those things. 

 Q. If you're going to miss it, you're going to miss it spectacularly, you've done that, haven't you?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I tried all the time and it just never went.

 Q. And 17 summed up the day, did it? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Exactly. I can say nothing. 

 Q. Just forget about it and move on, don't you?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I played well. Last week I played well. I do really struggle when it's cold. I don't like cold weather. My hands looked purple this morning. I don't have feel. I don't want to make excuses, but I don't like it. I played well in Spain and I'm looking forward to the rest of year.
