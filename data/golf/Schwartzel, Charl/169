 Q. Nice birdie on the last to finish up a good day. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, thank you very much. I was 1-under after six holes, and on the back side, which is the front, and got a bit -- I made a bogey on 15 and 17, which I don't think is the worst thing in the world. But bad bogey on 18 and then turned it around on my back nine, which is the front nine of the course, and played really well. 
 Hit the ball good and made a couple putts and really happy, 1-under.

 Q. Talk a little about the conditions, some of the guys were saying it was a little gustier today but the winds overall were not quite as bad?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Definitely, I think the course was easier today. We had a couple tees forward on those par 3s, difficult ones, and the wind was definitely not as strong as yesterday. I think you can see why the guys shot a little lower scores today.

 Q. 6-under par 64 for Sabbatini today, just your comments on that round?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Any day you can shoot 64 around this golf course, you've played really good golf, especially in conditions like this. Must have played really well. 

 Q. Not that many guys under par, but got Lee Westwood up there, just talk a little about the weekend on a tough course and what it will take?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, well, this tournament is wide open as it is. You've got Westwood, which is the No. 2 player in the world, and I think a course like this, it's what I like and I think it's what Westwood like. Guys are not going to run away with it I wouldn't think. Looking forward to the weekend.
