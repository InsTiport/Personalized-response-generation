Q.   Difficult day out there? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, I mean, it was very disappointing.   My good shots got penalized and my bad shots got even more penalized.   It was one of those where I didn't really hit such bad shots, and ended up just keep making bogeys.   I suppose you get some of those days.

Q.   Looked like you were battling on the back nine desperately to stay in it. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I figured if I could have just made the cut, you can still win the tournament.   I don't think with the greens getting so firm the winning score is going to be that low.   But, you know, it was hard in the afternoon.   The greens were getting bumpy.   18 just shows you, pretty much straightforward putt and it bounced out of line.   Nothing I can do about it. 

Q.   Aside from, that enjoy your trip to Perth and have plenty to take away from this trip?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, I was glad to be in Perth.   Like I say, I'm disappointed the way I've played, but I've had a great time.   It's a great city, and I would like to come back to redeem myself. 

Q.   Going to China next week? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I'm going to China next week.   Try again.
