 Q. Disappointing finish, but a lot of positives to take away?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Disappointing, but you look at a 68 in these conditions, I think that's very decent.   I gave it a run.   Could have completely gone the other way for me, 16 and 17, same amount of effort, they go in.   I was in a guy's footprint on the last, so the ball just shot out left.   But, what can you do.   
So, a good week, and try again next week.   
   
 Q.   At any point did you think you had a chance to win?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I was never really in it to be fair.   I was always behind.   I just thought standing on 13 tee that if I can get it to maybe 15 or 16, another four birdies from there on, outside chance.   So that was the thought process, and it was close, I got two early on there, and like I said, 16, 17 for the same effort.   But just short.   
   
 Q.   What's your schedule now?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Tampa next week and then a week off.   
   
 Q.   Looking forward to the Masters obviously, less than a month away now?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yes, I am.   It's going to be nice to go back there.
