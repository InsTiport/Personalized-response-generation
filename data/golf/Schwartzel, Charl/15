 Q. Nice way to finish off your week there. How would you assess your week?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I mean, it's a great week. I really thought towards the end there, especially standing on the 14th fairway, if I could make another few birdies I would have had a really good chance, but Sergio and Justin, they're really playing well now and the first two days was very difficult and on the weekend it was very good weather and I played really well.   
   
 Q. You kind of got on that hot streak there, did you kind of think maybe this could be like 2011 again?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Man, I was thinking, obviously, bringing all those memories back and trying to make that happen again. But it's hard to come back from way behind. And I played well and Sergio and Justin, they are going very well coming in.
