Q.   3‑under 68, are you happy with that round? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, I'm satisfied.   I got off to a sort of rocky start this morning.   The weather was perfect, the greens are perfect.   Obviously we were first.   I gave myself a few chances in the beginning and ended up making bogey, and I was 1‑over where I thought I should have been a couple under.   But then turned it around, shot 4‑under for my last 13 holes, and I had two great putts, 7 and 8, my 16th and 17th, that were big putts.   But overall I'm happy, put myself in position. 
I see Tiger is playing well and in good position.

Q.   Everybody has been talking about the 18th hole.   How did you find it today?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I made birdie, so I found it very straightforward. 

Q.   Did you lay up or‑‑
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I went for it.   I hit it out of the fairway bunker with a 5‑iron onto the green.   This morning with the greens being soft, you can fire at it, but if that green gets firm, it'll start getting very interesting.
