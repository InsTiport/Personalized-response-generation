CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I couldn't putt in this wind.  That was my biggest challenge.  I was 3-putting almost every hole.  If I putted better I would have been at a reasonable round.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I've always found it very difficult in these conditions.  So I felt up for the challenge.  Going out I felt pretty well, but as soon as I got the crosswinds, it was really difficult.  And then with the putting I couldn't make the short putts.  And I said to my caddie, I said it's hard for me to really give an opinion on this because I find like if I want to see it as a challenge, it really is a waste of time for me because I'm standing there and it's just basically luck, because I'm moving around so much.  And I guess that's the same for everyone.   
But I haven't narrowed it down how to play in that severe conditions.  That's hard for me.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: If the ball gets embedded you've got to play it.  And I had two.  I had one there and I had one on 15.  I had to take penalty shots.  That was fine.  It's still early on, spirit is still up high.  But when you start 3-putting from 15 feet in the middle of the green, that's more hard to take than taking a penalty drop.  That's just a bad round.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: You don't.  This is the thing.  That's what I'm saying, as much as you want to challenge yourself, really it's just luck.  You're hitting these shots and the ball is just going whatever.   
Whereas yesterday with a little bit of a breeze you can really play golf.  You can move the ball.  And the way it is out there now, it's not much fun.
