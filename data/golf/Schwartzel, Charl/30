Q. 67, great start.  What were you thinking after six holes?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It was a tough start, but I don't feel like I hit too many bad shots on the golf course.  It's playing difficult.  Each day I feel like hang in there and get one better as the round goes on.
Q. What's the general state of your game right now?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It feels very good.  I've been grinding badly for the last sort of month, but that feels like it's getting better.
Q. Well, it was a gold medal back nine with all those birdies, and then this was the last one you made at 17.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, we had 91 yards in, and I hit a sand wedge.
Q. How much do you like the golf course?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's a really good course.  I think it's a golf course that rewards the good player and guys playing well.
