 Q. With the wind yesterday and the rain today, the golfing gods aren't making life easy for you...
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: No, definitely not. Today the wind was pretty gusty, and yesterday it was consistently strong. The temperature also dropped by about 12 degrees, and then it went back up again. The wind's all over the place and then with the rain as well, it's very hard. The guys who finished earlier obviously had a bit of an advantage, but all you can do is hang in there. 

 Q. You said yesterday's round was one of your best ever...how did today's compare?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It was solid rather than spectacular today. I just had the one hiccup on the 12th hole, where the wind changed on me when my ball was in mid-flight, so I came up way short and ended up making double. But other than that I played pretty well again, if not as well as the first day. 

 Q. I know you've got one hole left to play, but what are your thoughts going into the weekend?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I'm in a good position, although I would've been in a better position if that chip had gone in on the last. But whatever happens, at least I've put myself in with a chance, and that's what I always look to do. 

 Q. Speaking to Ernie Els earlier, he said you were going to be the next South African superstar. That must be nice to hear...
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, it's great. It's always nice when you get compliments, but especially when they come from guys like Ernie, who's won so much in the game. Hopefully I can live up to it.
