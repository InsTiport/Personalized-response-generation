  Q. 2 & 1 winner in the second match, it was not the prettiest of matches but you must have felt an enormous amount of pressure knowing that you need to get off to a great start, and you were just second out.   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Our early groups are obviously very important, because we need to get points on the board very early on, sort of to give the guys at the back sort of inspiration to see that we can win this thing.   
 Obviously playing against Dustin, an unbelievable player, is always going to be a tough match. I really dug deep. I really wanted to win.
