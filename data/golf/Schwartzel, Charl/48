  CHARL SCHWARTZEL: They are slow.  I'm normally a little bit more comfortable on quicker greens, but I don't know, just -- maybe still just finding my game.  You know, there's glimpses of some really good stuff out there, but then the bad ones still whip you, and that's just causing a lot of bogeys.Q. You made four in a row.CHARL SCHWARTZEL: That's like I say, there's glimpses of some really good shots and some good golf, but I feel a little frustrated, you know.  I played better at the U.S. Open.  I definitely swung the club better there than I did here.  Today was the first really good day, but it feels like after the first two days of playing in that wind that I actually struggled to make full golf swings, and that caused a lot of sort of wayward shots, especially with the driver.  Normally the club that I hit pretty much the best, I have been for quite some time, but I just didn't drive it very well.
