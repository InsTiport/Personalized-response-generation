 Q.   The back nine, the wind started to swirl around; did it change the mind thought?   It was different to all week.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It changed direction from when we teed off on 1 to when we got to the back nine, definitely a different wind direction than the whole week.   A few of the holes became a little tricky with club selection, especially 16, you've got to carry water, so you don't want to get it wrong.   
Really you need to take a bit of time and committed to shots.   
   
 Q.   How mindful were you of a Medinah Ryder Cup come back; could you sense it on the back nine, that you guys were making a rally, and still are?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, you can see, more blue numbers were getting on and the guys were chipping in on the last to win.   It was a bit of memories of what happened last year at The Ryder Cup.   So there still is a very small chance.   
   
 Q.   You were allâ€‘square on the 15th and then you birdied two of the last three holes.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, it was a very tight game the whole way around.   I made a very, very bad error on 12, hit a very weak shot and he gave it back to me on 16.   So it sort of equalled out at the end there.   
It was going to be tight.   I knew I needed my game at least to keep us in with a little bit of a shout.   I'm very happy with that finish.  
   
 Q.   To match his birdie on 17, a difficult hole under difficult conditions; the winds were swirling.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I figured when I hit it close it might be my game but Keegan hit it in there and made me work for it.   All credit to them.
