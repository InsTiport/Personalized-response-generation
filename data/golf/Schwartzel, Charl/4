Q. Great save on that last hole to preserve that bogey-free round.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, I mean I got a little fortunate that it came down the path and then I only had a sand wedge. So, but, yeah, it would have spoiled my day to finish with a bogey. I played really well today, I played good.
Q. It look looked like you took care of the par-5s and it looked like you putted the ball well today. Is that kind of how it went?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I felt like I played, I gave myself a lot of opportunities and like I said I felt all around it was good. I drove it well, hit my iron shots good, putted beautifully. So it just, all in all, was just a nice good round of golf.
Q. Is it tougher to get into the rhythm of this tournament when you switch courses the first three days or do you know what to expect coming into this tournament?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: You know, with the weather being like this I think it's actually easier. This is the first time ever playing this event, but what I heard the weather in the past you get the wrong golf course on the wrong day, it's a little bit unlucky with the draw. But this week all the courses are good, the weather is good, so far not too much of a disturbance.
Q. Anything different for tomorrow or just keep doing the you same?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Obviously guys are going to make lots of birdies, but it looks like it's going to be nice again and, yeah, there's a lot of guys who played well, Jason played well, so you got to figure that they're all going to keep going making birdies and so you're going to have to get to about 20-under, I would say.
