Q. Obviously not the way you wanted to finish the round today but how happy are you with things up to that point?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's about as solid add I've played this golf course.  I hit the ball beautiful.  Really could have shot nothing today.  You know, would have been happy with 4-under.  The last putt was just terrible.
Luckily it's only the first round and got a couple to go.  But like I said, I hit the ball surprisingly good after being so sick yesterday.
Q. Is this a sign of how tough this golf course is?  I think only two players have gone bogey-free today.  That shows how tough it is around here.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's very difficult.  This course has always been tough.  It's windy.  It's always difficult to judge the wind.
Also, it's firm.  We don't normally play it this firm, so the ball is bouncing a little bit where if you're slightly off-line, it can bounce to places you don't want to be, where if it's soft, the ball stops and it's easier.  It's tough.
Q. Already very congested even though very early stages.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I think someone somewhere along the line will shoot a good score.  I had a 64 or 63 in me today.  I didn't make a putt at all.
Somewhere along the line, someone is going to do that and that's probably what's going to separate them.  But today, first day, everyone is probably just trying to get something done.  That's maybe why it's so congested.
