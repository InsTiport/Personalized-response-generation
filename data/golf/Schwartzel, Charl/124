  CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I played well.   Hit the ball fairly decent this week except for the first three rounds, had a bit of a cold putter.   And today, it was a bit wild.   Putter was pretty solid and then all of a sudden, I felt like I started rushing my shots and then the consequences were bad shots.   Have to work on that. 

Q.   Going through the back nine, you looked to have slipped back down, but come back into it with a wonderful surge?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I had mud on my ball on No. 12.   I aimed it right edge of the green and the ball went 40 yards left, so that's basically out of my control.   You don't need things like that to happen when you are trying to win a golf tournament. 
I made a good come back.   I thought I could make a lot of birdies coming in.   They were out there.   I figured if I could make five or something like that, I'd have a chance.   Got a bit unlucky on 16, if that ball would have bounced into the bunker, I would have got up‑and‑down and who knows coming in. 
17, comes up a yard short and ended up making bogey; if I was a yard further in, putting for birdie.   But, so it went.

Q.   Abu Dhabi, straight in for next week, very big tournament, and presumably, the game is in good shape by and large, isn't it?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, Abu Dhabi next week, and try again.
