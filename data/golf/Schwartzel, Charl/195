Q. You've put yourself in good position for the weekend?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  I certainly did. Today and yesterday I hit the ball very well. I am very pleased. I hit 17 greens yesterday and probably the same today. My putting is okay. I left quite a few out there today but I am very pleased with the way I am hitting the ball. It gives me more confidence for the weekend.
Q.  Are you a fan of this course?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  I don't like it as much as parkland but this is my fourth year and I have played the Open here, so I've played quite a few rounds here and I am getting more used to it. It's different. I've found a way how to play links. I had a good British Open on links and I've had a good tournament here so far. It's nice to play the Old Course when you aren't getting blown away and when you're only 67 kgs like me it doesn't take much wind to get blown over!
Q.  It's been a great year?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  Yes, I have definitely been more consistent. I had a good run around Open time which shot me up in the Order of Merit and if I can have a good week this week I might be able to creep into the top ten before the season ends.
Q.  Highlights today?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  I didn't have a bogey or a five on my card. I birdied the 5th - a driver, eight iron to 15 feet and 2 putted. I birdied the 7th- three wood, lob wedge to 20 feet. Nine I went for the green and chipped to 10 feet and made it. Birdied the 14th - got lucky, went through the bunkers and hit a 3 wood just short and chipped to 14 feet. Birdied the last, hit it onto the front edge and two putted from a long way.
