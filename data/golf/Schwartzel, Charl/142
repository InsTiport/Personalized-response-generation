  Q. That was an up-and-down day. What do you do for the rest of the day as the computer spits the numbers out?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, well, what can you do? You can sit and wait. I gave it my best, and I suppose that's all you can do. It's going to be difficult. You know, I had a bad finish. I actually played really good today. Just the whole week has been going sort of like my finish was.  
  
  Q. How close were you to taking a drop there at the 18th and trying to pitch it in?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: That crossed my mind. I figured, though, the ball was so far above my feet the chip would be very difficult. I was hoping to hit the first slope and bring it back and then have a putt at it. There was some decision to be made there.
