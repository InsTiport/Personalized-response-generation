Q.   Four birdies today.   How was it out there? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   This morning it was obviously tougher.   The ball doesn't go as far in the morning as it does in the afternoon.   So the course plays quite long; if you hit good tee shots, you give yourself decent chances, which I did. 
I felt like I played really solid.   Probably could have gone either way.   I 3‑putted 18, which was my ninth and could have taken me to 6‑under.   You know, if you have a good back nine, you could be up at 9‑, 10‑under par.   But unfortunately I went the wrong direction. 
But the game at least is there.   If I can just put it all together, then we can make a move. 

Q.   The course is playing tough, everyone is sort of saying that. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I think it's playing tough but I don't think it's playing any tougher than any other year.   But looking at the scoring, it is difficult.   So no one is running away with it at this stage, so it gives us a bit of a chance.

Q.   So you go into the weekend positive?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I would think a couple of good scores on the weekend would put you right in there with a chance.
