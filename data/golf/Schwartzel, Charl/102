Q.   How does that feel today? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I mean, it was a little disappointing.   Got off to a really good start.   I mean, on, what was it, 16, I thought which was a really good shot at the fairway came up way short.   It's very difficult‑‑ I found it very difficult to judge the wind on this golf course.   It feels very inconsistent, so it was hard to pull clubs.
I made a bogey feeling like I haven't hit a bad shot, and it sort of felt like it broke the momentum.   I just didn't get it going on my back nine.   When I finally made a birdie on No. 7, I gave it back on 9, I was thinking birdie on 9 and end up walking off with a 5. 
But 1‑under is what it is.   I really feel like I can shoot a low score out there.   So just stay patient and see.

Q.   It started off very quiet with the wind, did it pick up?   Could that have been a contributing factor?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Definitely.   I would say that's probably what it's going to do the whole week.   The mornings will be quiet and then pick up in the afternoon. 
It's hard, like I said, with all these trees around, it's probably constant up above, but inside, it's swirling a lot.   So it's very hard to get the right club, and on these greens, where you need sort of quite a bit of precision to hit the right side of these slopes.   It can be difficult if you start pulling the wrong clubs. 
But there is a good score out there, that's for sure. 

Q.   Five shots is it at the moment‑‑
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Five shots is nothing.   There's so many holes to go.   It's just a start.   You can lose it in the first round but you can't win it in the first round.   So it's an okay score for me.   I'm not out of it whatsoever.   Like I said, I feel like I'm playing good enough to make a good score.   You know, 7‑, 8‑under is out there.   But we'll just see what happens.
