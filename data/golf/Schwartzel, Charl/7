CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Look, I've had my fair share of troubles on this golf course.  I've skipped it willingly where I don't like it at all, and particularly these sort of holes.  But this week, played a lot better, and I played the tough holes well, so that's normally going to get you around this golf course.   
 Q.  You finish this tournament 14-under par, you must be very pleased because you really played well for four days.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah.  I played great all four days.  I played well, too, yesterday, just didn't make a putt, where today -- today I still had two three-putts, but I made the putts I needed to make, which is key.   
 Q.  I saw you in New Orleans and I thought you played well there with Louis.  Do you have a lot of confidence in your game right now?  Seems like it's really trending upwards.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, I started playing well there.  It's been feeling good for about a month, two months now.  It just hasn't sort of kicked in.  But yeah, I think playing with Louis freed me up a bit, and I've got good feelings.  You know, just started playing really nice.  I feel like I'm playing the way I should play.   
 Q.  The putting stroke looks really good.  I know you work on that all the time, but this week it looked really good.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, putting has always been really good.  I needed to trust it more, and now that I'm trusting it, trusting the lines, seems like the stroke is also smoothing, so I'm going to make some more putts.
