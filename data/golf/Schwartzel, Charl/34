 Q.  4-under par, 67.  That back-9 was pretty interesting.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, there -- I made really long putts and just thought I hit some good shots, too, on the holes coming in.  It was very difficult with the wind.   
 Q.  Obviously I look back to 16 and the up and down there after the ball had plugged on the edge of the bunker, that was pretty special.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, that was big, you know, walking up there and I didn't think there was going to be much of a chance and plugged in the bunker and got relief and I really wasn't in a very good spot and just played a really good shot.  Just got it nice up high and landed softly.   
 Q.  What was the key to your round today?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: You know, I just -- I knew it was going to be difficult.  Most of the day trying to aim for the middle of the greens and trying to keep bogies off the card because it was really -- when you did hit a good shot, just take it.  I didn't think I was going to make that many birdies but the game caught light on the back-9.   
 Q.  You're excited right now, got a couple holes left.  Congratulations on your solid play and we'll see what happens.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Thanks.  Thank you.
