 Q.  64, bogey-free, just some general thoughts on the round.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It was just a really good round.  The whole week I played so well and didn't make any putts.  I changed my putter this morning and I went back and I made some putts and that's the difference.   
 Q.  Did you go back to an old putter or a new putter?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I went back to a putter I never used in my life.  I've been going back to these putters that I think work and I just said, give me that, give me a putter that I never putted with, I won't even know what it putts like.  And I took it out and I really putted well.  I hit the ball as good as I did all three rounds and I made the putts.   
 Q.  You're projected at 28th.  You're on your way to East Lake more than likely.  Were you thinking about that at all?  Did you have a number in mind to get to the TOUR Championship?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I saw Adam Scott was tied 5th on 11-under when I teed off and I figured with the conditions, I needed to get to 13-under, that was my prediction, it was a 9-under round for me.  I got to 12, so I'm really hoping that it's just going to be enough.   
 Q.  What does it mean to play your way in from pretty far back coming into the week?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I played really well in these playoffs, up until the third round.  Every single one of them I've been in the Top-20 and I've hit the ball really good and I had a really awful time with the putter.   
So, I felt like I put myself in a very unnecessary position, but you got to deal with it.  And I came out here to see if I could keep my long game as good as it's been and I did and I struggled with the putting for the first three days.  And it just shows what really good putting does to your scoring.  So, it's just nice to come out and play some golf like I've been feeling like I should.
