Q. Charl, I know it was a frustrating bogey at 18 but really a nice back-9 for you. Made the turn 1-under and got it to 5. Your thoughts on how you played today.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Played great. I'm really -- I feel the way I played the last three days, my ball-striking has been probably the best it's been the whole year, really phenomenal. It's the putter. Today was slightly better. Very good putt on 18 but let it slip by. First two days were great.

Q. The golf course playing a little quicker now, seems you're getting a little more roll on the fairways, greens firming up as well.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: The first two days I was hitting drivers into the holes. I've actually backed off to 2-irons. I think the pins are up. Also going to dry and see some flyers.

Q. People were looking at your name at the 125 spot when the week started in the FedExCup standings. You're inside that now, we don't know how it's going the play out at the end of the day or tomorrow, the scoreboard shows it, do you ever look over there and see where am I on this thing? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: The scoreboards are big. But I try not to look at it too much. Lot of the FedExCup Points so much out of your control, you know, guys play well and if I feel like if I can keep hitting it the way I am and get some putts I shouldn't have any problem.

Q. Good playing today and we'll see you tomorrow.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Thank you.
