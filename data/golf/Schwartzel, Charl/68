  CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Obviously, Monday was a washout.   Nine holes yesterday and nine today, and then the Par 3 is pretty much all you can do right now.  
   
 Q.   I mean, having won before, does that put more pressure on you or is it easier?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I don't think it makes‑‑ I mean, maybe it makes a bit of difference if you've won.   But I don't think otherwise it's any different.   It's going to take the same amount of effort to win a game as it was before.  
   
 Q.   Do you think you are going to be in the mix for winning?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I sure hope so.  
   
 Q.   And tell me the‑‑ doing something about the green jacket?   Have you got any story?   Did you take your green jacket with you, obviously, and did you wear it often or how did you treat it, kind of?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, obviously, you get to take it with you.   I mean, any opportunity I had to wear it, I would wear it.  
   
 Q.   Like what kind of‑‑  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Well, any function.   When the guys had functions, you know, I would rather wear the green jacket than a suit.   It went down a lot better.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   Any funny stories or were you worried that it would soil at any stage?   What happens if you are really hot and you want to take it off and then somebody lifts it from the chair?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I left it in the car once and the car drove off.   Luckily the guy was honest enough to bring it back.  
   
 Q.   What did it feel like to have to give it back?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   You don't have to give it back.   You put it in your own locker, you know.   You get to wear it.
