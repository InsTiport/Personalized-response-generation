 Q.   Good day.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Sure was.   Felt like I played good the whole day.   I was keeping the bogeys off the card and I was giving myself really good opportunities on the par‑5s, especially the first three Par‑5s that I played.  
I missed short putts; didn't convert, which is pretty disappointing.   Then made my first bogey on the 6th and looked like all of a sudden the round was going to come tumbling down to a not‑so‑great round.  
Made a great save on 7 for par.   All of a sudden backed it up with two great putts coming in and turned it into a very good round.  
   
 Q.   How much confidence does it give you to put that score on the board without a lot of the putts dropping?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, it does.   Shows it's out there if you can get one of those rounds going where you‑‑ where things go your way.   You hit it well, you definitely can make a pretty low score out there.  
Just don't know if we're going to get the opportunity.   Playing in the afternoon the wind does pick up quite a bit.   Might get a bit more difficult as the week goes on.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel you're well‑placed to make a charge?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah.   Those two birdies gets you up there.   You know, I mean, it's a long ways to go, but if you can just keep in touch.   Like I say, played pretty well.   Hit a lot of drivers and hit it good.   Maybe one or two bad ones, but the rest was very good.   
Keep doing that, you can give yourself a lot of chances.
