  CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Like I said, keep shooting 68s, 67s, you'll be close on Sunday.   This one could have been quite a bit lower.   I gave a few back there in the middle of the round but at least made a few back coming in. 
So you know, two or three back maybe going into tomorrow, you know, it's basically going to come down to tomorrow, so hopefully I don't give those shots back and get off to another good start, that's what's needed.

Q.   Talk me through the eagle.   That was some celebration. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Nearly albatross there, wasn't it.   If there was ever going to be a flag that you've got a good chance to eagle, it was going to be the 7th today.   Great tee shot, hit a 4‑iron in there and caught that bowl and came funneling down.   From where we could see, it must have been really close to going in.   

Q.   Were you telling yourself, this could be my day, at that time? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   No, no, no. 

Q.   Too early? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I'm far away from saying it's my day.   I haven't played good golf for seven, eight months.   So it's just nice to be somewhere up there and with a chance. 

Q.   I'm sure it was nice playing alongside Louis in the third round, as well. 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It sure is.   Louis has been playing so great, so it was nice to see how he's doing it.   He's playing such solid golf, so it was nice to witness.

Q.   Do you pull each other along? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I mean, you know, obviously it's nice to see the guy play well.   But we had Rory and Luke in front of us, so those were the guys we were chasing.

Q.   What's necessary to catch them up? 
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Well, I mean, who knows.   I don't know what tomorrow is going to bring, but it's going to be at least have to be another 5‑ or 6‑under to maybe have a chance.
