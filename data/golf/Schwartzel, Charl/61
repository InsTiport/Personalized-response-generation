 Q.   From the water in the rough right up to the hole on 18, talk about that, that was a tough shot for you there to close it out.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, I mean, probably one of the better birdies I've made in my golfing career.   Probably not going to count for much today.   But I pushed it into the water, and I had 247 with elevation up, and to it played about 257.   Hit a 5‑wood‑‑ came out absolutely perfect and hopped to a back pin and made the putt.   It was a really nice way to finish considering the way that I played early on in the round.   
   
 Q.   And you finished 9‑under par, just talk about the round in general today.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, I played fairly well the whole tournament, actually.   I had real putting issues sort of rounds two and three and probably killed my chances of winning, but definitely played good enough to win or at least contend.   Changed putters this morning and putting was a whole lot better today.   
So got myself to 5‑under through 11 holes, and I figured if I could get another three or four out of it, I could hang around.   But it wasn't to be.   But I'm still happy with the decent way that I played.   
   
 Q.   How is it playing out there?   What kind of shape is the course?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I think the course is there for the taking.   It's probably as easy as you're going to get it.   I think you're not going to see Valhalla this easy any time soon.   Balls are stopping on the greens.  
The only difficulty is there are quite a few mud balls on the back nine, and I think that's going to catch some guys.   That's the only thing that's stopping the guys from really firing at the flags.
