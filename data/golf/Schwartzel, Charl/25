 Q.  Talk about that eagle, eagle on those back-to-back holes.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: That was exciting.  Hit a beautiful 5 iron.  Stopped south of the hole.  Finally found the fairway on 15 -- well, I can see number 6.  Beautiful par and stopped at the hole.  16, beautiful tee shot.  Probably one of the harder tee shots on this course.  Brought it down the middle and had 140 full gap wedge.  It just worked out perfect.  That was nice.  That doesn't happen.   
 Q.  What does that kind of do for your confidence as you go through a round?  Do you have any -- you don't expect to hole a shot like that?  But to go eagle, eagle and sit at 4 under par at that time?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's a bonus.  I felt like I was keeping it sort of together, making pars.  Sort of realistically thinking birdie on number 6.  But I had two really good chances.  That is an eagle opportunity if you can do it.  But 16, that's a bonus.  That really helps.   
I felt comfortable.  I just went to sleep on the back nine, bad double bogey on 14.   
 Q.  It's a pretty rare feat.  Do you recall ever doing that or coming close to doing that before?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: No.  That was my second hole in this playoff series other than Barclays.  Funny enough, the week before the Barclays, holed up on the fairway there.  Making some shots.   
 Q.  And the season's finishing?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: And it's finishing.
