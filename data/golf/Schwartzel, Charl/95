  CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I hit some good putts, at 16, 17, 18, the greens was getting really bouncy and they were fast, so it was hard to really hit aggressive putts.   But I suppose everyone played on them and came up a shot shy.  
   
 Q.   Got to be pretty proud of the effort, Riviera not an easy course to figure out and you figured it out pretty good, your first voyage around this place?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, I felt pretty comfortable from the time I got here.   I had long travel to get here, and happy with the way I played.   Happy to continue the form.   
   
 Q.   Do you think part of it has to do with the fact that it's kikuyu grass, you're used to it in South Africa?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It is the best fairways to hit off, but I'm used to it, but it's still a different golf course.   I played well, could have gone my way at the end but unfortunately it didn't.   I came close.   I played pretty solid.
