 Q.   First of all, talk about sitting there at 5‑under, going to the final round.   You've got to feel good about where you're at?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I am.   The conditions are tough, but it's been cold and windy the last few days.   I felt like I hit the ball pretty decent.   
I think if I can continue the ball‑striking and giving myself chances I can make a few tomorrow and give it a shot.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the weather and a little bit late start, finishing up the second round, going into the third round, it's been kind of a wild turn?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   It has been.   I think they've done well considering the conditions with all the rain, the golf course has held up really well after yesterday's rain and I'm looking forward to a good Sunday.  
   
 Q.   What's it going to take to win the tournament?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Like I say, the conditions the way they are, you never know.   Maybe three or four under would be close, I think.   You never know, if someone gets on a run.   But you'll be close with that.
