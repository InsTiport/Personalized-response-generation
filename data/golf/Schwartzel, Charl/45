  CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Lot better than it has been. That's the real positive side of it. I played well. I eliminated mistakes this weeks. I made four bogies the week which I think is only what I'm doing in one round.   
I think that's probably been the key, played really well and maybe if I had this putter in the bag from the beginning of the week it might be a little different. I feel good, you know.  
   
 Q. What does it say about when you needed to play well to continue your season, you did it? How much confidence does that give you moving forward now in The Playoffs?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: A lot. I think sometimes in this game when you don't really have a choice anymore, you know, you really stick in there and give it your all and, you know, was like that for me this week.  
   
 Q. Congratulations.  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Thank you.  
   
 Q. When did you change putters, for the final round?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: On the 3rd Round.  
   
 Q. Masters putter, right?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah.  
   
 Q. When did you stop using that one?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I've been on and off but I haven't used it for about a year, you know, but I did some modifications to it. Made it a little longer for this week and it felt a little better.
