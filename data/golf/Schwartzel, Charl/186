 Q. Charl, what a great win for you. You take down Sergio Garcia on the 18th green, a 1-up victory. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I'll tell you what, a hell of a game. 
 At the end there he sort of gave it to me a little bit, but still, I think, one hell of a match and a game.

 Q. I would disagree with you, I don't think he gave you anything. I think you earned every shot today. What a wonderful, gutty comeback, 2-down and three to play. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I didn't feel the pressure coming up 17 and 18 and I thought I hit a really good bunker shot on 17, and knocking in that six-footer just sort of got it going. I put the ball on the green on 18 first, and that's it.

 Q. It looks like you had a great day with the putter, 26 putts on the stats. You must like these greens. Just talk about the golf course and what you think of it. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I think it's a brilliant golf course. The first time I played this course, I thought it was a course that you were going to make a lot of pars on, and today I just -- like you said, I had 26 putts. I really rolled the ball well. I made those clutch putts, the ones I needed to make. In match play once you start making those putts, your opponent, it's hard. That's exactly what you have to do in match play, just knock in those ones, and it grinds them down.
