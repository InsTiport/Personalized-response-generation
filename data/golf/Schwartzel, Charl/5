Q. If you can just talk about your round, especially your start, getting off with a couple birdies there.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, I three-putted the first for bogey and then birdied 3, birdied 5.  Felt comfortable, seeing the ball good, swinging nicely.  But then had another three-putt on 7.  I missed a really short one on 8 for birdie, and that sort of just held everything.  Nothing went in.  Kept giving myself chances, which I suppose is what you need to do on this course.
It was hard to make putts today for me.  You know, got to go out tomorrow and keep hitting it like I am, and hopefully I start rolling in a few.
Q. Just a long day today of golf in general.  Just kind of your thoughts as you go into the final round in a Major.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, tomorrow you're going to have to hang tight, be tough.  It's going to be hard to gain.  There's a lot of guys tied.  But you're in there with a chance to win a Major.  So got to dig deep.
