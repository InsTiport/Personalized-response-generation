Q. How pleased are you with today's effort?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Really, it was important for us to have a good day after yesterday.  I think it was a good thing I sat out yesterday, just got myself a little better.  Felt good out there today.  I played really well, and a couple under par, and made a few crucial putts.
Q. Considering how you felt a few days ago, how satisfying is it to come out here and play well?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I'm satisfied.  The golf course is very much in front of you, so I didn't need to see it too many times.  Felt comfortable, hit some good shots, and most of all for me, I hit some good putts.
Q. In the big picture, you guys won this session and are now right back in it.  How much momentum do you guys take from today moving into Saturday?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Lots.  Yesterday woke us up, got off to a bad start, and I think the boys were really up for it yesterday afternoon when we got back into the locker room.  We had a good chat, and I think we're very proud, well played.
