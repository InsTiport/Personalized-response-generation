   CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I felt better than the first two days, did a little swing -- just had a little tweak in my swing there, and I hit the ball good. I think I missed only two fairways, and it was good, solid.

 Q. What's the mindset for tomorrow, U.S. Open a couple weeks off, and I'm sure you're pointing towards that?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Of course, of course. You know, I'm just trying to get something going, and it is, it's moving where I want it to be, and this course is playing tough now. That's what you need just going in before the U.S. Open.

 Q. You played Augusta, Players, here and U.S. Open in a couple weeks. How have you juggled both sides of the pond?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's not easy. I was hoping for some better way down in England, but there wasn't. I didn't play well. I played good in Spain, but it's difficult when you're traveling along, but that's what you've got to do if you want to be a world player.

 Q. Rory is doing the same thing a little bit. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: If you do it -- I mean, if you can somehow go out for two weeks either side of the ocean, then it's worth your while. But if you start hopping around one week, one week, it's going to get you. You're not going to perform as you should.

 Q. How much has your life changed with the Masters?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I mean, it's changed quite a bit. Winning a major championship is just a little bit more elite than the others, and it sticks. It doesn't go away, which is great. I mean, it's all been good.

 Q. I heard that you take the jacket everywhere, and I saw you with a green shirt. Is that all by design?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, I figure green works for me (laughing). I take it everywhere. I only get to keep it for a year, so might as well see it every day.
