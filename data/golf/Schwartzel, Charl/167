  Q. Eagle on 7, walk us through that if you could.   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: On 7?   
  
  Q. 8, sorry.   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It was just a good tee shot. I got a bit of wind from behind, so I managed to be able to carry that bunker on the right, and it obviously left me a good angle in. Hit a perfect little 5-wood up about a yard short of the green, and couldn't have asked for an easier little chip, and I managed to pull it off. It was a big momentum -- got a lot of momentum out of that shot.  
  
  Q. Greens seemed to be in your favor today. Tell us about the conditions and how you felt about them.   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I mean, you couldn't ask for any better conditions out there today. I thought the greens were very fair. They weren't too firm, either. So good scoring conditions if you hit the ball good, which I managed to do. I put myself in good spots and gave myself opportunities.   
  
  Q. Could the round have gone much better today than it actually did?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, I mean, a round can always go better. I didn't birdie 13 or 15 after not being in too bad a positions. I missed a little tap-in here at the last.   
 I played really good. If things really went your way, it could have been pretty low.
