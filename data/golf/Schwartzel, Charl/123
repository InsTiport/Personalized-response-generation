 Q.   Solid start, tell us if you are pleased with the result and how difficult is the course playing?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I don't think the course is playing anymore difficult than any other year.   I think it's still quite a bit of low scoring out there.   I played fairly decent, missed a whole bunch of putts.   Walked off with 2â€‘under.   
Suppose the way I hit the ball, that's probably the worst I could have shot.   
   
 Q.   What's the strategy for tomorrow?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Play the same sort of golf and make a few more putts.   You don't win it on the first day.   You need to work yourself up the leaderboard and put yourself in contention coming in Sunday.
