  Q. What was the key to that today? Which aspect of your game?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I don't know. It was actually quite -- I lost five holes, and he at the end lost seven holes. We didn't halve a lot of holes. It was up and down.   
 It was quite an exciting game to watch, actually.   
 I played well, did good off the tee. That always puts a lot of pressure on a guy if you play well off the tee.   
  
  Q. Do you come into this championship with a different sort of attitude than you did last year?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, like I say, I'm full of confidence. My game still feels like it's riding a roller coaster.   
 As long as I keep positive and execute my shots, I think I'll be very good this week.  
  
  Q. I've just been chatting with your manager. He was telling me that Darren Clarke has been helping you. Has that been valuable?   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, for sure. He has been very good to me. I got to play with him quite a few times. He just helped me with getting my blow flight down a bit, controlling my shots a bit more, turning onto the ball a little bit more. It helped a lot.  
  
  Q. You are obviously playing Jim Furyk now tomorrow. Any thoughts on that?  
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I'm playing a great player tomorrow.   
 Once again, I know if I play the way I can play, I can beat him.  
  
  Q. Wish you luck.   
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Thanks.
