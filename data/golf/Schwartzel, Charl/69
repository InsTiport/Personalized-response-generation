 Q.   Pretty tough first round.   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yeah, this golf course has become I think a lot harder than it was in the past, and I think that anything under par, the way the conditions were, would be really good.   
Very happy with the way I came back the back nine.   
   
 Q.   This is a brand new course, as you mentioned.   What do you think you scored last year with this‑‑ the course that played last year, the way you played over today and yesterday?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Pretty much the same, because kept hitting on the fairways, and the problem comes when‑‑ if you're going to miss a few shots.   You'll get penalized a lot more.   But if you're playing good golf, keeping it on the fairways, you wouldn't be too far off.  
   
 Q.   Are the greens amenable to your approach shots?  
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   They are.   They are difficult.   You know, they firm out a little in the afternoon.   But I think that for a golf course that's only been open for a few months, it's phenomenal.  
   
 Q.   Do you like the new design?   
CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   I do.   It's become a real monster.
