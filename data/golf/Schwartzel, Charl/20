 Q.  No question you were moving today.  Birdie, birdie to start, three of the first five.  How do you like the way you got off?  
CHARLES SCHWARTZEL: It was nice, I made a nice 40-foot putt on the first few holes.  I played really well the first three days.  I think the first two days, nothing happened for me on the greens, but today, made a whole bunch of putts and that was the difference.   
 Q.  How comfortable are you on this course?  
CHARLES SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, this morning, I thought to myself, if I can shoot a good score, I know how difficult this course gets in the afternoon with the wind and the greens getting firmer; then I'm not out of it.   
So I'm pleased with this score, put myself back in the tournament, and if it gets difficult this afternoon, which I think it is, I'm four or five back, we'll see.  You know, if I can shoot 5-under tomorrow, I don't think I'll be very far off.
