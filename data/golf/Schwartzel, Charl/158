 Q. These matches are not easy to win, are they. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Doesn't seem like it. It was a tough day out there. He played well. Obviously Ross is a very tough competitor, played in The Ryder Cup, and he's won this tournament. It was always going to be a very tough game, and the way he played the last few holes made me really work very hard.

 Q. What were you thinking when his putt went in and you stood over yours? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It was all-or-nothing for me. I put a very good swing on it, got inside of him and when it went in -- that's the nice thing about match play I suppose. Those are very quick putts and you don't necessarily have to worry about the ones coming back. 

 Q. Sometimes when players win a Major Championship they find it difficult to kick on, but your manager Chubby Chandler told me that you're incredibly focused on really pushing on. Tell us about that. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Definitely. I think a lot of guys try to change things after they have won big tournaments and I just try to do exactly the same as what I did before. Every tournament I play in, same focus. I can improve on what I've got, which at this stage feels pretty good. 

 Q. You just beat Ross Fisher, defending champion and you were in control all the time. How was your eagle putt on the 18th to win the match? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I was up most of the day. We had a very close game the whole day, and Ross made such a good finish, that he forced me to make eagle on the last. 


 Q. You will be playing Johan Edfors or Luke Donald, any preference?
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL: Well, all good players are playing in the Volvo World Match Play, so whoever gets through, I'll have to try and beat this afternoon.
