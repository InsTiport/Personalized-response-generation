   CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  Shooting 67 is always nice.  The golf course is not that difficult, so the scores are out there.  But you can't go out there and shoot 70s and expect to move up the leaderboard. So I felt like I drove the ball well, hit a lot of good iron shots.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities for birdies.  Made a few good putts on the back nine, which are my front nine and they sort of dried out a little bit on my last nine holes.  But it still feels good. 

 Q.  Tell me you're not going to beat yourself up about those putts coming home. 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  No, definitely not.  There was a lot more good ones than those two bad ones. 

 Q.  Only at the halfway stage, but did you feel that momentum building knowing you're moving up the leaderboard? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  Yeah, it's always nice to see your name up the leaderboard.  I haven't played very well the last sort of two months and have been working very hard on the game, and it really feels good.  It feels as good as it was when I won. 
 I put myself in position, probably will be a couple off by the end of the day.  There's still two more rounds to play. 

 Q.  What's the reasoning in the last couple of months? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  A couple of things.  Some personal issues and also the swing was starting to struggle a bit.  Just made a few -- well, not really changes, but like working a bit more on it.  And also changed my putter this week, went to the White Hot Odyssey. 

 Q.  Just one of those cases that hard work sort of solves things as normal? 
 CHARL SCHWARTZEL:  Definitely.  There's nothing that beats putting in a bit of work in this game.
