 Q.  Just general comments your thoughts about today's round.  1-under, you had to feel good about that?  CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I think any time you shoot under par around here is quite an achievement.  I must say it's probably slightly easier our first nine holes than it would be for the leaders.  But the back nine was as firm as it's going to get for everyone.  Very pleased with 1-under, played really well.   Q.  You have progressively gotten better as the tournament has gone along.  Do you feel like you are getting a better feel for the course?  CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I don't think -- I think I'm playing the same as I did the first day.  I played really well the first day.  This golf course can penalize you severely for hitting good shots.  That's pretty much what happened to me on the first day. Now, the next two days, probably got the better side of the bounce a few times.  I have hit really quality golf shot, which is a really good nice comfort going into tomorrow.  If I can pull off something tomorrow and bump a few putts into the hole, can be patient, if I can get it to under par, I don't think it will be far away.
