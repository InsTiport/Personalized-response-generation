Q. Some comments on your match with Matt today, 2-up victory.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I was probably 5-under, and Matt made six birdies from the eighth hole in, you know, with the eagle.  So it was really -- he made one hell of a comeback, because I was way up, but I wasn't playing badly.  I make birdie and he makes eagle, and I was losing like that.
It's always going to be tough playing against Matt because he's a really good putter, and he putted really phenomenal today.
Q. How did that feel to be 5-up early, given the way that the International Team has been behind the 8-ball.
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I was surprised that I sat out yesterday for both matches.  You know, I was playing actually pretty well.  For me it was almost trying to really show, prove a point and play really decent today.
Being way up was sort of nice for me in that sense, you know, but Matt took me to the last hole with the come back.  I had to grind really hard.  I'm pleased with that win.
Q. At the start of the day, was there a sense from the guys just to, it was almost like a hopeless situation, but was there a sense from the guys to close the gap?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I think just close the embarrassment.  Don't get too embarrassed.  So see if we can win more singles matches; see if we can at least win this section.
Q. Almost like a mini-victory?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: In a sense.  See if we can win at least this session, because we haven't won one yet out here.
