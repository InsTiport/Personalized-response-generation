 Q.   Talk about your round today, 3‑over, not too bad getting around.   Talk about highlights, lowlights?  
BRIAN CAIRNS:     No.3, I hit a wedge in there, hit it over the green, made 6.   But pretty steady from there on out.   I didn't really hit it bad off line.   On the tee I hit it‑‑ I think I hit it in the first cut twice, other than that I hit every single fairway.   On 17 I got a little nervous.   I got a good look at 10 greens.   That was kind of cool, though, getting in the crowd and having a clean shot.   Made bogey.   And then 18 making birdie was‑‑ are you kidding me?   
   
 Q.   The crowd was going pretty crazy.   
BRIAN CAIRNS:     That's what it's all about.   That was the coolest thing ever right here.  
   
 Q.   What's this experience like compared to the others?   
BRIAN CAIRNS:     This was a lot more like, okay, I can compete.   I'm not afraid of embarrassing myself.   You know, I can play.   The two guys I played with, I was right with them, and it doesn't even bother me now.   I learned a lot last year.   There was so much hype and I was so in awe of everybody.   I mean, this year I feel like I belong here.   
   
 Q.   And you've got two pretty good PGA TOUR professionals you're playing with, and you were one shot from Noh and tied with Sean O'Hair.   
BRIAN CAIRNS:     Yeah, Noh is going to be someone to be reckoned with the next couple years.   This kid can play.   If he starts making putts‑‑  
   
 Q.   What's your outlook for tomorrow?  
BRIAN CAIRNS:     I'm not going to say I can get it under par, but I'm just going to keep hitting fairways because I feel really, really, really good if I can hit the fairway, and if I can get it on the green for a birdie putt, I made some 35‑footers today.   I can make some putts here.
