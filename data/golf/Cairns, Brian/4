   BRIAN CAIRNS: Bummer, you know. I tried. That's all I can ask. Yeah, a little frustrated, but I don't know, I expected more of myself, and I just didn't believe enough, I guess, is the bottom line.  
  
  Q. Talk about the feeling on the first tee getting ready to tee off in the last major of the season. What was that like?  
 BRIAN CAIRNS: It was like a blink. It just happened too fast. I really wanted that to be a slower moment. I hit a pretty good shot actually, but it was great standing up there and feeling like I'm teeing it up on the same ground that Bobby Jones played, or was here. It was nice playing with some of the best in the world.  
  
  Q. I can't help but notice the bright yellow hat. What's the support you've gotten from your family and friends back in Michigan meant to you?  
 BRIAN CAIRNS: It's meant a lot. Even though I played bad today, I've gotten 60 text messages already that said, you know what, no big deal, it's not going to change you, it'll probably make you better. I've got a great support group, and --  
  
  Q. You won't be out in the heat of the day tomorrow. You'll be out in the morning. Do you think that's going to help you out some?  
 BRIAN CAIRNS: I think so, yeah. I think -- I mean, I felt great. It's not like I hit the ball really bad, just hitting it in spots you can't hit it. I tried taking a couple risks and they backfired on me. You know what, I don't feel bad about what I did.
