Q.   Big question is the wind, how hard was it out there today? 
BRIAN CAIRNS:   It was tough.     Couldn't believe how much it moved the ball, even with wedges it moved the ball 30 yards in the air.   I mean, you just can't control the ball when it's moving that much on these greens. 

Q.   Have you ever had to face conditions like that before? 
BRIAN CAIRNS:   No, I played overseas in Scotland, Ireland, even over in Bandon Dunes, it's that windy.   But just the pins that close to the edge, you've got 50,60 footers, it's really hard to make a 5â€‘footer for par out here. 

Q.   After yesterday morning where conditions were quite a bit better, what sort of adjustments do you try and make as the day went on today?
BRIAN CAIRNS:   Not really anything.   You know, I hit a lot more greens yesterday.   I think I only hit like six greens today.     It was just really hard to hit a ball on the green and keep it on the green.   But no real adjustments but lines were a lot wider.   Starting the ball at the pin is hard to do. 13 and 14 were just brutal, brutal holes. 

Q.   You've played in a couple of PGA Championships before, how is this one different from the others? 
BRIAN CAIRNS:   This one I think personally is a lot more playable than Atlanta last year.   I felt like I could play here a lot easier than I could at the Athletic Club, no doubt about it. 

Q.   What do you take out of this week to take back to your club? 
BRIAN CAIRNS:   I don't know.   I guess I played with Noh and that's the future of the game.   Just told the kid, man, keep going, keep trying, because Sean O'Hair didn't finish, he hurt his wrist, but you know, got to finish and keep playing.
