 Q.   Thoughts on the day, the first time making the cut, what are your overall thoughts on the round and being here this weekend?  
STUART SMITH:   It's a lot nicer to play on Saturday than on Thursday and Friday.   So it was fun.   It was a fun day.   Joe's a great guy to play with.   Beautiful weather.   So couldn't think of a nicer way to spend my Saturday.  
   
 Q.   How did the course ‑‑ how was it setup today and what were your thoughts on that?  
STUART SMITH:   The course is playing nice.   Some guys should go low out there.   First few holes are getable, wind's not too blowing yet, but it's getable out there.   You just have to hit some quality shots into the greens and roll some putts.  
   
 Q.   Must be exciting for a lot of the folks out west still being able to track you here this weekend.   Have you had a lot of inspirational messages from them and thoughts over the course of the last few days?  
STUART SMITH:   Absolutely.   We had couples golf last night and they sent me a picture of all 60 of them rooting me on, so that was pretty cool of the.  
A lot of texts, a lot of Facebook.   So a lot of support back home.   
   
 Q.   Up until the last two holes what was working for you throughout the day today?  
STUART SMITH:   I think I just wasn't making any bad shots, really.   I didn't make many birdies, but was never really in position to where I was hurting myself to make bogeys.   
The last two holes sting a little bit, but it's all good.   I'll have a good bite to eat and go at it tomorrow.
