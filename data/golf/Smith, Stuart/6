 Q. Stuart, pretty good round getting around today. Take me through it a little bit?
 STUART SMITH: First of all, excited to be here. Great to watch those guys roll the rock; Scott and Jerry, it's a whole different game I'm seeing. But a little shaky start. Probably a little bit nervous. A little bit excited. But once I settled down, I pretty much stayed within myself, parred every hole on my second nine,1 through 9.
 Nice birdie on 17, that was my highlight and a miscue on 18 missing a real short putt.

 Q. What's the experience been like so far this week?
 STUART SMITH: Fabulous. What a privilege to be here and represent my club, my section, The PGA of America. It's just an honor to be here. I'm enjoying every minute of it.

 Q. What's the goal for tomorrow you? Played well today and you played the last eight, nine holes even par. What's the goal for tomorrow?
 STUART SMITH: The nice thing is I started to feel more comfortable. I think if I can hit a few more quality shots out there, I've got to think of playing the weekend. That's not out of reach now with a good round tomorrow.
