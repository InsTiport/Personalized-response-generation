 Q. Obviously not the results you were hoping for today. How did the course play differently today than it did for you yesterday?
 STUART SMITH: I think it played a little longer. Maybe the weather was a little bit stickier today. Otherwise, I just didn't hit the shots. Pretty simple. It was great watching these guys play. I enjoyed the heck out of watching Jerry and Scott play. They play a whole different game than I do, that's for sure.

 Q. Going off of that, as a club pro playing the PGA Championship, what can you take away from this experience?
 STUART SMITH: It's just been a great -- it's been great. I mean, I can't -- I guess I never knew what it was. This being my first one, missing qualifying for it, knowing what you're missing, but it's certainly a very special week, and I'm very proud to be here.
