Q.  Obviously quite an honor to be playing in a field such as this.  Tell us a little bit about your experiences here and what your reflexes and what you're going to remember most about these two days of competition here.
BOB GIUSTI:  Well, it is an honor to be here, to play with these, you know, its SENIOR Tour guys.  The Champions Tour guys.  I'll be back.  I know that.  And Hugh was a gentleman to play with.  I could play with him any day of the week.  And I just love it.  I mean the experience here, the people are great.
Q.  Is somewhat whetted your appetite for next year's competition?
BOB GIUSTI:  Oh, he yeah, it always does.  I guess four years ago when I    two years ago when I made the one in Valhalla I said the year before I said I know I can make it to this tournament and I did the following year and I did this year.  So it's    I'll make it next year.  I'll be back.
