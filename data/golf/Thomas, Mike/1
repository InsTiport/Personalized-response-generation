MIKE THOMAS:   Fortunately I was out there following because with this lack of spectators it would have been hard to find somebody.
Q. Where did you pick up the bag?
MIKE THOMAS:   13.  13 fairway.
Q. What did he say to you?
MIKE THOMAS:   He said he just didn't feel well, needed to go in.  Obviously with the heat and everything, that's what he needed to do.
Q. I know you're always with Justin, but how much different is it when you've got that strapped on your back?
MIKE THOMAS:   Well, I mean, it's player and caddie, it's not coach or dad.  Just trying to ask him what he wants me to do and trying to get him in in fewer than he got in.
Q. Did you do that in 2018, was it Kapalua?
MIKE THOMAS:   Yeah, same thing, Jimmy had a bad flu.  But that was a little harder walk.
