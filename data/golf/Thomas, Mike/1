  Q. I just wonder if you could sum up your emotions.  Obviously, it seemingly got to you as well.
 MIKE THOMAS:   Yeah, we've been through a lot the last couple months, and losing my dad, I think, impacted Justin quite a bit.  He just kind of has not been himself the last month or so, which is understandable.
 He kept getting better every day this week, which was good.  He wasn't hitting it great, but he kept getting it better and better.  It was so nice for him.  I told him today when it was over that looked like a round of the old Justin Thomas, just ball striking the heck out of it.  Geez, if he'd have had that putter rocking and rolling, he'd have won by six or seven, but it was good to see that ball striking come back because that's kind of what's been missing.
 Q. Anything technical change from Friday to Saturday?
 MIKE THOMAS:   No, we just looked.  We kept checking the same things all the time.  He had the club a little bit across the line, and we kept trying to work it a little more down the line at the top.  You know, he was close all week, and he was swinging good this morning.  You just need to watch where the club is on top and stay on top of it coming down.  That's all you need to do.
 In the moment, you never know what that's going to end up doing.  It was nice to see him just really comfortable out there striking it.
