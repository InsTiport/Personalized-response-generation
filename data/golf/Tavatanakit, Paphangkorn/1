 Q.  On you go; tell me about this match.  
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: It was hard out there.  I didn't really make any putts or didn't score at all because of the conditions.  You know, the balls are spinning a lot today on the fairway and on the greens, so it's really hard to try to attack the flag because it's -- I feel like every pin today, it's like way back, like you only have three yards, pin high, and I don't want to risk going over and have a hard shot in, so I just stuck it in the middle of the green.  My lag putting was not that good today, but I was -- I was able to manage to win the match today, so I feel really good.   
This afternoon is going to be a lot harder, I guess, because of the wind, and maybe the rain, too.  It's going to be a long day.   
 Q.  What can you learn from the morning round that will help you this afternoon?  
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: I feel like I'm going to be more -- I'm going to be more used to it, to the conditions, regarding this morning.  I'm just going to try to take it shot by shot the same way I did today and yesterday.
