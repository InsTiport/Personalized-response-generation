Q. 7 & 6.  You and Lucy both finished 7 & 6 today, the No. 1 and 2 seeds.  Just tell me how it feels to finish your match so early.
PAPHANGKORN TAVATANAKIT: I didn't really think about that.  I was just enjoying my round with my caddie.  We were having really funny conversation going on the whole round.  But yeah, it was just an unbelievable golf I played today.  It was the best I've ever played in years I would say, and I would say the mental part was the best, too, in years.  I didn't really think about sticking it close, making the putts at all.  I just go with the flow and it rolled in, and just going on.
Q. What's giving you that confidence heading into this week?
PAPHANGKORN TAVATANAKIT: Still, anything can happen in match play.  I still have that mindset.  But just taking it shot by shot is what I need to do for the rest of the week to try to make it to the finals.  I'm just going to -- I'm not going to say that I'll try to play like today because it's not going to happen, I think, because like no matter how hard you try, you just can't try to make eight birdies in, what, 12 holes, and that's just -- that's really odd.
Q. You made eight birdies today?
PAPHANGKORN TAVATANAKIT: Yeah, seven on the first nine.  I mean, like yeah, one hole was conceded, but yeah.
Q. And you haven't played real strong on this course.
PAPHANGKORN TAVATANAKIT: Yeah.
Q. So you think you're starting to unlock it a little bit?
PAPHANGKORN TAVATANAKIT: Yeah, it's just the mental part that I unlocked for the past three days.  I stayed mentally calm and strong, just gave myself a good chance all the time.
Q. What's your routine now that today is over?  What will you do after this?
PAPHANGKORN TAVATANAKIT: I'm just going to go practice a bit putting, maybe hit some balls just to get the feel of the smoother swing a little bit and just work on my short game like regularly.
Q. Do you have a special breakfast routine that you eat?
PAPHANGKORN TAVATANAKIT: Sometimes I have, sometimes I don't, but since it's a clubhouse breakfast, I don't really care.  Sometimes I have superstitions, but it's just sometimes -- I do have like some ball marking, though.
Q. Superstitions?
PAPHANGKORN TAVATANAKIT: Yeah, and every time I wear red, I feel like I can do well.
