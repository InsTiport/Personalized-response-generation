   BRENDAN JONES: I've got to be pretty happy with 1-over because I didn't bring my A Game today at all. But yeah, it was fun. I had a good time out there.   
 Just disappointed that I played so well the first two days and I just couldn't find a fairway today. You know, it's pretty hard to shoot under par when you're in knee-high rough.   
  
  Q. Was it feeling any different, because Robert Allenby said the same thing, he hit it well and every shot he thought was good ended up --  
 BRENDAN JONES: It's funny because I thought I would be really nervous, and I wasn't. You know, I was more nervous a couple of weeks ago playing in Japan. For some reason, I just felt comfortable, but it just wasn't any day. I've got to get up on the fairways a bit tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Conditions today, how did you find them?  
 BRENDAN JONES: Perfect. I think we got the best end of everything. The first two days was good and today the breeze -- the wind wasn't terrible. And now it's pretty much died down, so I think conditions were just perfect.   
 It's frustrating that Tiger didn't really blow us away and there's a lot of people still in the tournament; it's going to be pretty hard for me tomorrow. But if I can just draw on the first two rounds, then there's no reason why I can't put in a good one tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Was it a two-way miss?  
 BRENDAN JONES: The driver was going right and the 4-wood was going left. I didn't have much else to try. But it wasn't like I was hitting poor shots. It was good drives but they were just going right. I hit one poor drive up 9 but just hit a hook into the left bunker which I don't normally do. But you know, a 73 and got to be happy with it.
