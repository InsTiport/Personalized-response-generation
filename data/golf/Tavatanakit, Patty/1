  Q. First of all, when did you know or did you know the run that Lydia Ko was putting on you?
 PATTY TAVATANAKIT:   I had no idea.  Didn't look at the leaderboard at all today just because -- I saw her name up there but I didn't look at it.  I wanted to play my own game, which I did, and did a really good job of that today.
 Q. I think everybody watching will second that.  Tee'd off with the lead and played some great golf today.
 PATTY TAVATANAKIT:   Thanks.
 Q. What was the internal talk?  What were you telling yourself?
 PATTY TAVATANAKIT:   Just kept hitting good shots.  You know, my putts were rolling well.  Just didn't read it well today.  Overall I feel like stuck to my game plan I overcame the adversity out there.  It was tough mentally and I just feel like it was a lot going on and I feel look I hammed it pretty well
 He was pretty nervous the first couple holes.  Probably first seven holes he was really nervous.  I can't walking into my shots kind of slower to automatic you have calm myself down every time I hit and feel like that was really important for today.
 Q. Watching TV as is child you point at this TV when Tiger was playing and told your dad, I want to be like him.  Did you always believe this moment would come?
 PATTY TAVATANAKIT:   No, honestly, not.  It's a dream come true.  Every time I play here I remember exactly I was on this green receiving my low amateur award and I saw they were jumping and I took a Snapchat and the caption was, One day.  It's been crazy.
