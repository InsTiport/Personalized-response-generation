Q. Talk about your round a little bit.
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: Like today wasn't really going great.  Like no putts dropped at all, apart from like two, three feet.  Apart from that, it's a tough course.  It plays a little tougher today.  The wind picked up a little bit, so that makes it harder.  But overall, I played solid.  I hit some good shots, but it's just -- the putts just didn't roll in.  Hopefully tomorrow is a better day.
Q. Is there anything you're looking to adjust going into the round of 64 tomorrow?
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: I'm just going to keep on playing my game and trying to execute shots tomorrow and just hope for the best, not getting too frustrated and just kind of -- like the past few rounds were kind of like my practice round of trying to execute shots, try to make putts, try to have the right mindset going into match play because it's going to take a lot out of me, and the two rounds are good preparation I would say.  I have a lot to work on and definitely trying to improve my game throughout the week.
