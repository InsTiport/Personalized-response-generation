Q. You poured in a lot of putts today.  Tell us about that a little bit.
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: Well, definitely my goal today is just to like enjoy playing golf because it's my last day here at U.S. Open.  And obviously like it's a great opportunity for me to be here, and I'm really grateful about it.
I just gave it a good read.  I tried my hardest for every putt.  I would say I got lucky when the speed was kind of off, but I gave it a good stroke.  And I have been working on my tempo a lot after February with my coach, so that paid off a lot and obviously it went in.
Q. You're in a one-stroke difference between you and Albane Valenzuela as you start the day.  You play together and you are the person who is going to be low amateur.  What does that mean to you?
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: Definitely it means a lot.  I actually thought about it last night.  There's a lot of goals and things in my mind when I play, but during my shots every shot, I just try to stay empty in my mind.  I think that helps a lot.  I know what she's capable of doing here too.  She's a great golfer.
There's a lot of great amateurs that can shoot low numbers.  I play my game and it ended up like this.
Q. When you are out on the golf course, as you came into the Women's Open, what was your goal?
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: I honestly have no goal coming in because this is like my fourth week I have been.  I've been playing championship, regionals and nationals, so I'm pretty burned out-ish.  I just wanted to enjoy the week.  I know it's the U.S. Women's Open; it's a big deal.  But thanks to the rain, it kind of softened down the greens a little bit.  I was able to stop the ball on the first round and shoot that 2-under.  So just play golf, I guess, come here and enjoy the week.
Q. Did you ever think you could finish inside the Top-10?  Did you surprise yourself maybe?
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: A little bit with how I played.  There's obviously a lot of mistakes I made throughout four days, but I guess it's a tough course and it's a great week for me.  But I'm just really speechless that I finished in the Top-10.  So coming in, the goal for today was just like to play golf and the result I'm hoping for is to be Top-10 and Low Am.
Q. What is your relationship like with the Jutanugarns?  Did they give you any advice?
PATTY TAVATANAKIT: We're not like that tight.  We know of each other.  We have seen each other around.  I have been playing a few tournaments since I was 14 or 15.  I have seen them around and they inspired me obviously to like boost up my game and try to be in the top.
