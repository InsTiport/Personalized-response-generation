 Q. Brad, what a way to finish with a 66, a chip-in birdie at 18. 
 BRAD ADAMONIS: Yeah, and I hit a lousy shot in, but that said, my caddie said, "Chip it in. We haven't chipped in all day." It was a pretty good-looking shot. I almost flopped it, and I decided to chip-and-run it the last second. I'm glad I did that, and what a way to finish.

 Q. Three birdies in the last five holes. How did you find the conditions?
 BRAD ADAMONIS: I thought it was playing pretty tough. I just tried to hang in there and play one shot at a time, and luckily I put a good score together.

 Q. Tell me a little bit about the course. It has been redone in the last couple of years, and I know a lot of guys have complimented it on how it is. Just talk overall specifically about the course and its condition. 
 BRAD ADAMONIS: Yeah, I think they've done a great job with it. The sod is filled in. Last year there was some seeding. But the course is looking really good. It's real mature, the greens are getting real good, and I think they did a great job.
