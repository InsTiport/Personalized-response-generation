 Q. Solid opening round for you. 
 TIM HERRON: Yeah, not too bad. I didn't finish well, but you know, I have tomorrow morning. Greens should be a little better. Hopefully they'll kind of wake me up and get me fired up.

 Q. I know you're disappointed with the tee shot back on 17, but still, 66 is a nice way to begin this tournament?
 TIM HERRON: Yeah, it's not too bad. The scores are low, so you're going to have to shoot a couple low ones.

 Q. Do you like tournaments like this? It's been a rough grind the last few weeks on the PGA TOUR. You've played some championship courses. 
 TIM HERRON: Well, this golf course can get squirrelly, too. If it firms up a little bit and we get a little bit of wind, you probably won't see the scores quite as low. The greens have to firm up just a little bit. 

 Q. You've got an early tee time tomorrow. Take it deep. 
 TIM HERRON: All right, thanks.
