Q.
You kept yourself in contention today.  Tell us about your round.
TIM HERRON:  I gave myself a chance.  I only left one out there, and that was about a two-and-a-half-footer on 16, three-footer probably, but the way the hole is looking today, it felt like it was a two-footer.  You know, that was for birdie.

You know, I've struggled, so I know the game is tough and it was kind of my day, and I knew just to kind of suck it up on 17 and hit a shot, and I hit a shot and made a good putt.

And then I was just kind of confused on 18 with the wind and had a good up-and-down.  I hit a good drive down the fairway and then I didn't hit a very good iron shot, probably my worst iron shot of the day.
Q.  What do you think it would take to put yourself in position to win the tournament?
TIM HERRON:  Well, I think if I got to 10 I would have a chance with the wind blowing.  You just never know.  It's kind of a squirrely golf course.  You can make some birdies, you can make some bogeys.  If you get started the wrong way it's hard to stop on this golf course.
Q.  What effect do you think the wind could play in the outcome of the tournament?
TIM HERRON:  You know, it wasn't too bad, but if it picks up this afternoon, my chances aren't too bad.
