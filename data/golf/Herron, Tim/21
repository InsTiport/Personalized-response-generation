 Q.  Talk about the course? 

 TIM HERRON:  It was a nice day today.  It almost played like a Sunday.  This is my 8th Masters and it played like a Sunday for how firm it had gotten. 

 Q.  How do you think it will play on Sunday? 

 TIM HERRON:  It might not be playable. 

 If it stays like this, over par is going to win.  I'm thinking they might see some new pins that aren't their normal. 

 Q.  Regarding his play. 

 TIM HERRON:  It was a tough day, but I hung in there.  I played fairly conservatively.  I'm hitting the driver good and my putting is steady.  I made some good up-and-downs coming in so hopefully that will give me some momentum. 

 I better get to bed, I have an early tee time tomorrow.  I'm just trying to hit every shot.  There isn't an easy hole out here.
