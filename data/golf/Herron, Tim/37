Q.
Tell us a little bit of what you went through today. 

TIM HERRON:  I got a lot out of my game today.  I hit the ball very well and putted well, hung in there.  Didn't drive it very well.  Next few days I've got to drive the ball a little better and that will take some of the heat off my putter.  I'm just trying.  What can you do?  It's hard.


Q.  A lot of players have talked about the need to hit the ball high into these greens.  Does that suit your game?

TIM HERRON:  Yeah, I'm a high ball hitter.  I can take it upstairs if I need to.  Like on 16, it's 480 or whatever uphill, and I hit a wedge in there just because it's just playing so fast.  You can drive it 360 because it's so firm.


Q.  Is this a course where you have to pick and choose places where you want to be aggressive?

TIM HERRON:  Well, yeah.  There's really not that many places where you can be aggressive.  You just need to make a few birdies, and if you get it in the fairway and you've got wedges, hopefully you can get it around the hole and capitalize on it.  You've got to really putt this week.


Q.  Take us through your bogeys and birdies. 

TIM HERRON:  6, I had 7-iron. 

The next hole I tried to hit driver, on 7, and I hit it in that bunker.  I hit a pretty decent bunker shot on the green to about eight feet and hit it right over the edge, the putt, and it didn't go in.

12, birdie, par 5, I hit driver, 3-iron to the left bunker and hit it about 15 feet short and made that. 

14, came back with a bogey, I drove it in the left rough, hit a pretty good wedge or 9-iron out of there and hit a pretty good chip to about ten feet, missed the putt.

16, came back with a birdie.  I hit it about a foot.

Then 18, finished off with a bogey.
