  Q. Tim, great start, 6-under, 65, and what a front nine. Tell us about it. You get off to a great start, birdies on 1 and 2 and three more after that?  
 TIM HERRON: I was contemplating using a long putter this week, and I wasn't catching the long putter quite square on the face, so I went back to my old putter and just pushed the ball in the hole and it worked that way. I've had so many lessons over the year putting that I kind of just went back to what feels good instead of probably what's right.   
  
  Q. The conditions out there today, rarely do you get the 17 and 18 and not see the flag moving. Pretty still out there?  
 TIM HERRON: Yeah, it's hot and humid. This could be the calmest I've ever seen Harbour Town play. If it doesn't rain, we're in for a good week, good test, just because the greens are getting firm. You know, it receives the ball from the fairway. But it's getting firmer on the greens, chipping and stuff. So it will be a good test.   
  
  Q. Your game right now, I know the finishes aren't what they have been, what have you been working on? Was it the putter? Has that been the big thing?  
 TIM HERRON: I have no idea what I'm working on. I'm trying to find something every week. It's been a struggle. So it's probably putting. I'm not hitting it terrible, but I'm not hitting it like I have in the past. So hopefully I won't start guiding it around here this week, and make some putts like I did today.   
  
  Q. Good stuff today, good luck the rest of the week.   
 TIM HERRON: Thanks.
