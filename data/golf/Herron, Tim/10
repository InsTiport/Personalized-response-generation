 Q. Gees, what happened out there?
 TIM HERRON: I have no idea. Been working hard, and I don't know exactly what I've been working on. Just kind of been soul searching for the last couple years. 
 So just positive. Just had no idea it was there, and I stayed patient and it finally happened. I mean solid play, made some putts. Missed a couple early, but kind of stayed patient, and you know, my bad shots, I guess good breaks, so --

 Q. Everybody's making bogeys, because everybody's hitting it in the rough, and it's so hard to make pars from the rough, but you obviously hit it well. 
 TIM HERRON: Yeah, I hit it well, but I hit it in the rough. If you miss it big, you're in some trampled-down stuff, so you can play from there a little bit, but I think my fairway percentage is pretty good the first two days.

 Q. It is tough if you get it in the rough on this golf course this week, isn't it?
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. And with the wind this afternoon the scores probably won't be quite as low, so I think I put myself in position.

 Q. Talk about your putter. You've gone to the Ghost?
 TIM HERRON: That's the Holey Ghost. It's the one with the hole in it. That's why they call it the Holey Ghost.

 Q. How did you go to it?
 TIM HERRON: Probably five, six weeks ago. So been pretty good. You know, it helps with playing. And I have probably a little easier time lining it up with the three lines on it. So it's a good putter so far for me.

 Q. Hey, whatever works; right?
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. Exactly.

 Q. Go get 'em this week. 
 TIM HERRON: Thanks, guys.
