  Q. Tim, great run, particularly on the front side. You got yourself in great position for the Back 9 on Sunday, which is what you gotta do; right?  
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. I don't know what happened. Just didn't make some putts. Was there going through 13. 13, yeah, I got us at 19 under and chance to get us to 20 on 15, and then hit a drive that had a bad lie and couldn't get it to my layup and hit a shot that I haven't hit all week.   
 Yeah, I mean I don't know if I wasn't committed or something. I don't know what happened. I actually had a good number. It was a nice firm wedge. I had 130. The wind was swirling, so maybe I just didn't do it.  
  
  Q. You played professionally all week, though.   
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. I had 131 on 18 and hit it 140, so if I could have done that. If I could have just traded shots, I would have been all right.  
  
  Q. If's and but's. You did move up into the top 100, though. You've taken care of things now for sure. That's gotta feel good.   
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. I wanted a chance to win. I don't have many chances, so I'm disappointed with that. So anyways, go onto next week.  
  
  Q. You off to Frys?  
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. I think so.   
  
  Q. Good luck to you.
