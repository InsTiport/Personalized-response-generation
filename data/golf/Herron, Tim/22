Q.
Talk about your patience today and how you felt with the low scoring?
TIM HERRON:  I tried to stay patient and shoot even par and just got absolutely lapped today.  I'm still in the Top 10 but I'm going to go out and shoot low tomorrow.  You know, I left some out there.  I made too many bogeys.  I only had one bogey in the first two days.  I don't know, I probably had like four today.  So, you know, I feel like I'm hitting it better every day.

Even though I shot even par, I think I hit it probably better today.
Q.  How does the Ryder Cup factor into your mind coming into the week and how does it factor into your mind coming into the week and how does it factor into your mind going into tomorrow?
TIM HERRON:  Well, it's golf.  I mean, you know, you think about it when you're away from it, but when I step on the first tee, I've just got to play golf tomorrow.  That's all I can do.
Q.  Is it going to be tough for guys, too, with everybody so bunched up?  It looks like it could be a situation where not a lot of guys are able to get the outright points where you're going to be sharing a lot.
TIM HERRON:  Thank God.  I'm not smart enough to figure all that stuff out.  Bottom line; I've got to play good golf.  Trying to calculate all that stuff, that's for the media.
