  Q. Do you know what hole you're on and what day it is even?  
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. You just deal with it. I mean it would have been nice to get the whole -- it would have been nice to get the whole round in.   
 But I'll come back and finish tomorrow at 7:30, play a couple holes, go back.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. I haven't played here in a while. But yeah, it was fine then. There's a lot of birdies out there with the wet conditions, so yeah.   
  
  Q. Did you come on the course today expecting another day of starts and stops?   
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. They were saying in the afternoon it could be. We were just hoping it would be past like 5:00. I think we stopped the first time at 4.   
  
  Q. Looking more into the weekend, how frustrating is it to have this sort of start and stop?  
 TIM HERRON: Yeah. Hopefully we can get in another 18, I guess, tomorrow. I just feel bad for the fans.
