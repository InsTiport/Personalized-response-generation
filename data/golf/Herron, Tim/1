Gotta be pleased with the way you finished.  Looking like it's definitely going to be a top 5.   
TIM HERRON: Well, you never know.  The group's going, they've got nine holes, right?   
 Q.  Right.  
TIM HERRON: So yeah, that would be good.  Should get me in those playoffs which or those -- whatever the hell it is, tour school or something, I don't know what they call it anymore.   
 Q.  What does this week mean?  I know you've got some limited starts.  With conditional it's tough.  You have to take advantage when you're out here.  
TIM HERRON: It just means -- I haven't worked real hard but I knew my game was still kind of there, so it was kind of nice to put together -- I jacked a couple of putts that were inside four feet -- the first hole.  But I just kind of hung in there.  So, yeah, it's kind of all it meant.  I don't know.  It's my 600th event.  I don't know what it means.   
 Q.  What would it be like to see Greg potentially win this week?  
TIM HERRON: That would be great.  That would be awesome.  He's grinding his butt off.  We're kind of in that stage of our career -- should we hang with the family or should we keep going.  And he chose to keep going, playing some Web.  And I wouldn't want any other guy to win, actually, right now.
