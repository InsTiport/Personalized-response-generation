TIM HERRON:  I think this week I putted well.  I hung in there, bad swing on 18, you know, I played really consistent, smart, kind of all day.  I made some great up-and-downs and then just hit it in the water on 18, and that's the easiest tee shot you can have on 18, straight downwind, 30 miles an hour.  It's not like I meant to do it.
Q.
What were the conditions like?
TIM HERRON:  It was hard.  You know, it was playable, though, very playable.

Q.
Was it basically a battle for second, Tim, with David's lead going in?
TIM HERRON:  Well, it's hard to get off to a good start.

Q.
(Inaudible).
TIM HERRON:  Yeah, it's tough.  You never know what could happen.  There were some really dangerous holes, and David may have had a hard time on some of them, on 11.

Q.
Talk about the weather.
TIM HERRON:  It was close to Thursday.  Teeing off early helped, but it was a little harder than even on Thursday.

Q.
Talk about the changing that they're proposing.
TIM HERRON:  I have no idea, anything about the changes.

Q.
Did you like this course?
TIM HERRON:  Yes, I did.
