  Q. Tim, solid golf so far. 11 under par, your thoughts going into Saturday?  
 TIM HERRON: Well, I'm in position. I know it's a shootout on the weekend, so I'm just hoping to keep rolling the putts. Today I made a lot of 15, 20-footers. I know the greens pretty well, so you know, stay aggressive with the putting.  
  
  Q. The whole thing for Vegas, it seems like it feels like I gotta get five a day. You don't want to play from behind out here and have to make seven or eight in a day. Five's not that hard if you can stay at that number, and you're right there right now.   
 TIM HERRON: Yeah, it's true, but you know, you can shoot a real low score, so you have to stay patient if things are really going your way early.   
 But you know, every hole is kind of a birdie hole if you put it in the right position. 17 today was even making -- there's not a lot of places to make par from off the green, so you kind of have to take it right at it.  
  
  Q. Well, great playing. Keep it up through the weekend.   
 TIM HERRON: Yeah, thanks.
