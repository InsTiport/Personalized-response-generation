  Q.  I talked to you the other night and you said you hadn't played all that well since winning.  Well, 6-under 66 today, good finish.   
 TIM HERRON:  Yeah, good finish.  I worked hard, put my old driver back in the bag and just putted really well.  I played somewhat conservative, I didn't get too aggressive and played good, made the putts.  I think I had eight birdies and two bogeys and shot 6-under, so it was fun.   
  
  Q.  Like you said, having not played all that great since winning, what did you need to work on or what wasn't working for you?   
 TIM HERRON:  Well, it has been the putting, and now I figured out some of the mechanics and gaining the confidence with the putting, so that's good.  I've just got to keep working hard on my driver and getting the ball in play.   
  
  Q.  You changed drivers this week?   
 TIM HERRON:  I just went back to my old driver.  It's a little shorter, maybe a little straighter.  It's a Taylor Made, R7, the old one.   
  
  Q.  So it's not worth it to trade accuracy for distance?   
 TIM HERRON:  Yeah, I think so.  I was looking for distance.  I just needed to change and try something different.   
  
  Q.  Something different to look at?   
 TIM HERRON:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  As far as the course, Ernie said this is probably the best-conditioned course you guys have played all year?   
 TIM HERRON:  Yeah, it's perfect.  Why the scores are low is because this is the calmest I've ever seen it here, and guys are taking advantage of it.  If it keeps getting firm and fast.  It'll probably be an exciting weekend.
