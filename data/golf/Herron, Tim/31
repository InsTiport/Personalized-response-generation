TIM HERRON:  Well, the greens probably didn't have as many spike marks.  I knew the greens were perfect, and the only thing, I had late tee times the first two days, and they kind of just spiked up a little bit.  I played hard, played well today, and I had a through-putt on 17.  But other than that, I played pretty well.
Q.  (Inaudible).
TIM HERRON:  Yeah, I hit a spectator.  I got it up-and-down, so I gave her the ball.
Q.  What if you didn't get up-and-down?
TIM HERRON:  I still would have given her the ball.
Q.  After the first two rounds, did you come in today thinking, "I still have a shot"?
TIM HERRON:  Well, what I saw by the scores not being that low, if you play well, make some putts, get things going, you can do pretty well here.  Or if you play aggressive and go for some of the pins -- if you start playing conservative with your irons, you're having a hard time getting the ball up-and-down.
Q.  Are the greens fast?
TIM HERRON:  Really fast.  They got really fast.
Q.  Not what we're accustomed to because there's usually rain?
TIM HERRON:  Yeah, and I think they'll get a little faster, so it's hard.  Like the pin placement on 11, pin placement on 15, they seemed like they were getting faster.
Q.  How bad were the spike marks?
TIM HERRON:  I mean, I just didn't know many guys wore spikes out here anymore.  I wear soft spikes.  On a poa annua green, soft spikes are probably worse, and then on brand-new bent like this -- this is like carpet.  These things are awesome, and then just to see a couple spikes -- and they're fast, so what it can do is once the ball gets off line, then you miss the putt.
