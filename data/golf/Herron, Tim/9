  Q. Tim, is this a matter of just got nothing to lose, come out and just free-wheel it a bit?  
 TIM HERRON: I just wanted to play solid. You know, you can't get too far ahead of yourself. That Magnolia course changes a little bit. I think probably with the wind probably got maybe a little lucky playing on the Palms and got off to a decent start, even though parring the first hole. So yeah, it was a nice day playing with Chris, and it's a good way to finish so far.  
  
  Q. What does this do for you heading into tomorrow?  
 TIM HERRON: Well, it gives me some confidence, but you know, the Mag's a totally different animal. You know, it depends on where they put the tees, and you know, it can play long.  
 But you know, it gives you a little confidence, and I'm putting pretty well. So if I see the lines and keep the stroke nice and smooth, hopefully look for a good weekend.  
  
  Q. This is a must week for you. Has this sharp end the focus a little bit more for you this week?  
 TIM HERRON: You know what, I've had a lot of must weeks, and I don't put must on it anymore. I'm trying to just play golf and have a good time at it, you know, instead of having to play well, you know.   
 Of course you want to play well, but that just kind of happens. So I'm just trying to gain some confidence going into next year, and hopefully this can give me some confidence here at Disney.  
  
  Q. All right, thanks.   
 TIM HERRON: Thanks.
