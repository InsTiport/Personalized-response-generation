CYDNEY CLANTON: It felt good.  I had six birdies in a row.  It's the second time I've done it actually, so that was cool.  Just kind of -- I hit a good putt on 16 that lipped out pretty much.  I hit a good putt on 17 that didn't drop, and then just kind of didn't play well on 18.  So played really well.  Hit the ball really well.  Saw a lot of really good things, so just ready for the weekend.
Q. You obviously have done enough well that mentally you're going to be in good shape, bounce back from this finish and be ready to go tomorrow?
CYDNEY CLANTON: Yeah, there's just too much good going on.  I mean, I'm hitting the ball well.  I'm putting it well.  I'm putting it where I want to, and the ball went in today.  I mean, an unfortunate finish, but you just kind of have to get over it and move on and tee it up tomorrow because tomorrow is a new day.
Q. When something like that happens on closing holes, is it in your head the rest of the week or do you learn what you did wrong?
CYDNEY CLANTON: Oh, no, it's completely forgotten.  Don't even think about it.  Just got to come up with a game plan and be committed when you get to those holes and know that it's just a hole.  I mean, your game plan is your game plan, so try to commit to your game plan and do the best you can.
Q. Are the scores a surprise to you after playing the practice rounds and playing yesterday with conditions as they are?
CYDNEY CLANTON: No, it was going to be deep, and I think it's going to be -- I think the leaders are going to go low this afternoon.  There's not much breeze right now.  I don't know if the weather is coming in or not.  But the scores will be low, so you'll have to keep shooting low numbers.
