 Q.  Just tell me how it feels to be playing so well right now.  
CYDNEY CLANTON: Really good, because to be honest with you, when I set out the schedule I was thinking about not coming.  God is good.  I'm glad I'm here.  I'm playing really well.  I'm hitting the ball really well.  Given myself a lot of opportunities in the last few days.   
 Q.  Anything in particular different that you've been working on?  Just something clicking for you?  
CYDNEY CLANTON: I've been working mentally a lot.  I've got a new sport psychologist, Bhrett McCabe.  I started working with him in January and really just trying to become mentally strong and just figure out who I am as a player and just kind of go from there.   
 Q.  7-under on the first six holes for two days.  Did you know that?  Played those holes particularly well.  Any reason why you like this first set?  
CYDNEY CLANTON: No, not really.  I mean, they're just -- I mean, if you set yourself up off the tee you're giving yourself an opportunity.   
I mean, today I just really hit the ball well.  I mean, I had tap-ins the whole front nine.  That makes it easy.   
So I don't know.  I guess it looks good to the eye.  I've had loft really good yardages on those holes.  I think those yardages have helped.   
 Q.  Done anything fun in Hawaii this week?  
CYDNEY CLANTON: I'm staying with a group of girls and it's a good group of girls.  We played a game the other night like a Cranium, but I think they call it Heads Up.  It was hilarious.  We had some good laughs.   
But I think today is the only day -- it rained yesterday, so I think today we're going to try to do something, play tennis or got to the beach or something.
