 Q.   Just talk about your overall week.   This is your best finish on tour this year.   I know it's early in your career, but for your career just give us some thoughts about the week.   
JONAS BLIXT:   We did a lot of work during the four weeks I was off swing‑wise, and haven't done too much short game‑wise.   It worked a lot better than I thought.   I was kind of surprised this week.  
But feels like I'm moving in the right direction and it's getting better.   So if it wasn't for the Seminoles last night I probably would be sitting down there with a trophy right now.  
   
 Q.   All joking aside, you have to feel good about your swing.   Being in the final group, it's holding up for you?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, absolutely.   I trust my swing coach.   I think we're on the right track.   I'm looking forward to being in this position again.  
   
 Q.   As far as the last three events, plans for those?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Right now I'm playing all of them.   Really got no other plans.   Just play those and hang out see what happens, get better.
