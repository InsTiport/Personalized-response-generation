 Q.  Jonas, bogey-free round including a great finish.  You make the turn at 17 and 18.  
JONAS BLIXT: Yeah.  That was my 7th, 8th, and 9th hole, yes.  Yeah, actually thought about that when I was signing my scorecard.  If I play these holes like this, it should be a good week.  Yeah, those holes are good holes, good finishing holes.  To play in even par you're very happy, and today I guess a little lucky.   
 Q.  Birdies at 17 and 18 to send you on to your inward 9.  Was the golf course a little softer with the rain?  
JONAS BLIXT: Yeah, in the morning -- I played Tuesday and the wedges were bouncing a couple yards, and I mean the irons were kind of hard to kind of stick to the green, but the morning they were spinning off the greens almost.  So, it was a little bit of a change for us.   
 Q.  Great start, congratulations.  
JONAS BLIXT: Thank you.
