 Q.   How do you feel about your day, first competitive round here at Wentworth?  
JONAS BLIXT:   It's a great golf course.   The front nine, I never really got it going.   Never had any rhythm.   As you can see, didn't really produce any birdies there.   
Then my tee shot on 10, hit a really good one there and after that I felt very comfortable and I was able to make a couple birdies.  
   
 Q.   Known for your short game, and you made a par at the fifth from the bunker.   Can you talk us through it?  
JONAS BLIXT:   I tried to, my second shot on the green, 2‑putt and that's what you call a bonus.   
   
 Q.   Does that shot come naturally to you or something you've worked incredibly hard at?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Came to me naturally when I was younger, I missed a lot of greens so had to make a lot of up‑and‑downs.   Being competitive, you don't want to give any shots back to the field.   You know, working hard at it the last couple years and it paid off.
