Q.   What's your favorite hole out there at the moment?
JONAS BLIXT:   It's not 7 and it's not 11.   Don't want to play those again.

Q.   You've got to do them tomorrow. 
JONAS BLIXT:   I know.   No, I mean coming here and playing this golf course, I have so many favorite holes, and it suits my eye.   So coming in here‑‑ yeah, it just suits up for my eye, a lot of the holes. 

Q.   16 out of the 18 are your favorites?
JONAS BLIXT:   Yes.   If I can make some pars on 11 and 7, I'll be a happy camper tomorrow. 

Q.   How was playing with Bjorn today?
JONAS BLIXT:   It's great.   He's good at Swedish, and I'm not very good at Danish, so that made it a lot easier to talk to him.   He's a great player.   I like him a lot.   We've got some friends in common and talked a little bit about them and life and back home.   It was nice.   It was really nice.

Q.   Are you happy where you are after three rounds, where you expected you would be?
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, yeah.   Well, expected?   You can expect a lot of things.   But this is where I want to be.   I want to have a chance on Sunday, and that's what I play for. 

Q.   What speaks for you tomorrow?
JONAS BLIXT:   My putting is really‑‑ I've been putting really well around there.   And I feel like almost everything in my bag is kind of working pretty well.   If I can put the golf ball on the fairway tomorrow I think I'll be dangerous.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JONAS BLIXT:   Absolutely.   I thought I had a couple of putts today that really were really close.   You've got to keep hitting good putts.   And if tomorrow isn't my day tomorrow, then it's not.   And I've had a good experience and I'll definitely try to come back. 

Q.   When is the last time you putted so well?
JONAS BLIXT:   Probably when I won last year, Green Bay.   We did some tweaks, me and my swing coach just before this week, and it really worked out.
