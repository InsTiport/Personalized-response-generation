 Q.   Jonas, this is not your first rodeo, being in the hunt on the weekend.   A couple of weeks ago at the Wells Fargo you made a run at it.   You're figuring this game out!   
JONAS BLIXT:   Slowly.   It's getting better and better, to get to know yourself and know how to respond to the pressure that you have.   It's a feeling that you never really feel unless you're here.   
   
 Q.   You made with the two early bogeys, but then that eagle at 7 must have got things turned around because then you went on quite a run.   
JONAS BLIXT:   I did everything today, turned it around completely and felt like I hit the ball good this week and tried and tried and struggled in the beginning of the day.   
And when I got that eagle going I felt like, maybe if I can get a couple more birdies going I might have a chance.   
   
 Q.   How much more fun is this golf course when there is no wind?   
JONAS BLIXT:   I kind of wanted it to blow today.   I like it when it's windy.   I kind of like it like that, and I feel like I have an upper hand because I played Friday afternoon in it.   It's nice.   
   
 Q.   Not over yet.   Good luck and congratulations on a great Sunday.   
JONAS BLIXT:   Thank you.
