 Q.  Jonas, 1-under par 69, if we can just get some comments on your second round.  
JONAS BLIXT: Well, the front nine, I didn't feel like I was awake until like probably 10.  Did not play well at all.  I started playing okay after that.  Kind of just kept holding on.   
 Q.  What's the key when you have to sit around and wait in the locker room for so long?  What's the key to getting out there and getting started?  
JONAS BLIXT: I don't know.  I wish I had a bed so I could go back to sleep.  It was a long one today; what was it, five and a half hours?  I feel a little tired right now to be honest with you.  No, just stayed loose, I guess.  You sit there and kind of wait for the updates, and it usually doesn't look very good like this morning.  Just a long day.   
 Q.  Back-to-back birdies on No. 6 and 7.  Take us through those two holes.  
JONAS BLIXT: I probably shouldn't because there was a lot of bad stuff going on there.  Just hit a bad drive on 6 and ended up with a divot and hit a poor second shot and chipped in.  And then 7, good tee shot, really bad second shot and chipped in again.  So thank you.   
 Q.  Just talk a little bit about going into the weekend, currently three shots behind Jordan.  Just your mindset going into the final two rounds?  
JONAS BLIXT: It's going to be nice to get some rest and kind of recharge some batteries and kind of come out fresh tomorrow.  You can really get going on this golf course if you hit the fairways.  You know, you're having everything from 9-iron to 7-iron into these greens for me, and those are scoring clubs, so you can definitely go low.
