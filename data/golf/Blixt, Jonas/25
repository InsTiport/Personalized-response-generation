 Q.   That was an incredible match to watch, you both shot 62 in 18 holes and you win in extra holes.   Describe it from your point of view.   
JONAS BLIXT:   It's always fun to play well, and when I played yesterday, I didn't play my best.   Feel a little down about it and just wanted to go out today and play a good round of golf, and if I lose, I lose, and if I win, I'll be happy about it.  
I just want to put some good swings on it and hopefully some putts will go in.   Paul played great, especially on the back nine.   He definitely put a lot of pressure on me and snuck away with a couple holes.   I snuck away with a couple holes, as well.   It was just a great match.   I talked to my caddie about it and we were like, this is how we want to play a golf match.  
He was like 5â€‘under after like four or something, and hit it really close on 14.   I was like, this guy is hot right now, so I need to pull something out of the hat.   Luckily I made a long putt to stay one back and got one on the next.   And from there, you never know what's going to happen.   
You know, kind of a mental grind going back down the stretch, and kind of wanted to end in another way, someone making birdie instead of what will happen.   But I'm glad to be through.
