 Q.  Great tournament.  Take me through some of the big shots.  Let's start with the eagle on 6.  
JONAS BLIXT: Yeah, I pretty much had the same yardage I think on whatever day I played here, and we knew it was kind of the same wind and just if I hit a good 3-iron, we should be pretty close.  And I did.  So, it was kind of nice.  It worked out the right way.  I feel like the momentum was going my way there.   
I don't know, I just kept playing good golf.  I missed two greens and made two bogeys.  Not the easiest up-and-downs, but I kept trying.   
 Q.  Take me through a couple other big shots.  You birdied the 10th and then I thought you got a good break, you rolled it through the rough beyond the bunker at 11.  Had a six and a half-footer and couldn't coax that in.  
JONAS BLIXT: Yeah, that one -- I got really lucky.  I think that was one of the only bad shots I hit today.  I got lucky.  That's a big kind of ridge just by my ball and maybe three two, three more feet and that kind of curves the ball and then it kind of straightens out.  So, you just got to have perfect speed in order to get into that, around that curve the right way.  And to go in.  And I just didn't hit it hard enough.   
 Q.  Then the bogey at 14.  Was that set up by the lay up into the rough?  
JONAS BLIXT: Absolutely.  I was trying to hit a little stinger, a little draw stinger, and it just kept straight.  And two feet more left, and I would have been fine.  But out of there, the ball didn't do anything coming out of there.   
 Q.  You kept giving yourself great looks and rolling great putts on the way home, too, and they just wouldn't go.  
JONAS BLIXT: Yeah, no, I feel like today I didn't make anything.  That's what I wanted to do, and I wanted to give myself a lot of chances today and give myself a chance to win.  And didn't really do it.  But I tried.
