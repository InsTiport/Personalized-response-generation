 Q. Good day for out there. Just get some comments on your round.   
JONAS BLIXT: The last two rounds has been really good. I mean, I hit I think three, four shots a little squirrely, but rest of them been pretty good.   
Been putting pressure on the golf course, so it's been really fun out there.  
   
 Q. You like the format?  
JONAS BLIXT: Yeah. Don't think too much about it, but it's a little different. Nice trying to make eagle.   
Got my fair share of birdies these two days, and try to keep doing that.   
   
 Q. I know it's early, but you got yourself tied for the lead in the clubhouse. Got to feel pretty good about that heading into the weekend.   
JONAS BLIXT: Oh, yeah, better than not being.   
Still two more days. But, you know, you put yourself in that situation, and hopefully I can be there on Sunday coming down the stretch and try to pull a win out.  
   
 Q. How did it play out there today with the weather?   
JONAS BLIXT: Not too bad. I think it was rain on the first hole. The ball didn't go as far in the beginning. That's about it. The greens were a little soft maybe compared to yesterday afternoon. But, yeah, nothing really too surprising.
