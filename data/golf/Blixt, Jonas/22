 Q.   Good round out there today.   You finished really well.   Feel good about that?  
JONAS BLIXT:   I'm excited about the way I hit the ball.   And the way I putted I'm okay with, as well.   I need to work on the chip.   But other than that, the whole game seemed to come together slowly.   And I'm really excited for the rest of the season.   
   
 Q.   What were the conditions like out there?   Certainly windy up here, I know they can swirl down below, was it real tricky down there?  
JONAS BLIXT:   I think there was a storm, like a front coming in like two holes or something.   And, yeah, it swirls a little bit around here.   So we kind of kept track of it pretty good.   So there was no‑‑ I'm never surprised by it, how the ball is reacting.  
No, I think we did a good job of reading pretty much everything today.   A couple more good breaks, and made a couple more putts, we were looking at taking it deep today.  
   
 Q.   Jordan is shooting a couple of historic rounds out there, but you never know what can happen on the weekend here.   What's the approach going into the weekend?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, no, it's playing fantastic.   I don't know if there's been anything like it since Tiger did it in '97.   So it's very impressive.   But it's still half a tournament left to play and you have to get through 36 more holes.   
A couple of guys can shoot a good number tomorrow and maybe move up.   And then you see him maybe start thinking about it maybe a little bit, kind of creep back a little bit.   But the way it looks right now he's going to keep going, so it's going to be hard to catch him.
