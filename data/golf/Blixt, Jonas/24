 Q.   3â€‘down with five to play and nearly took it to a playoff?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Played awful the first 12 holes and didn't get my driver in the fairway.   It's hard to play golf just from the rough.   
No, he played definitely a lot better than me the first couple of holes.   Got a couple putts to drop and put a little pressure on him in the end which is a lot more fun.   
   
 Q.   Obviously disappointing but how have you enjoyed the overall experience of playing in the tournament this week?  
JONAS BLIXT:   It's great.   I like match play a lot and Volvo and IMG has taken care of us so well this week, so I have nothing to complain about.   Just have good things to say, it's been a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Fantastic match you were involved in yesterday.   What was the difference between yesterday and today?  
JONAS BLIXT:   My driver.   Hit a lot of fairways yesterday and was able to get my scoring clubs in my hand and get close to the pin.   Just didn't do it today.   Hit a lot more shots today.   I don't know what happened today.
