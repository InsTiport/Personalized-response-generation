Q.   Reflect on these two days that putt you right up there in the championship?
JONAS BLIXT:   Hasn't been too great but I kind of saved myself a couple times, and I hit a couple really good shots.   If I can keep hitting a lot more good shots and make some birdies, I should have a chance on Sunday.

Q.   Scoreâ€‘wise you're in a nice position on that board?
JONAS BLIXT:   I can't complain.   I don't know if anyone is going to run away with it this afternoon but I thought it was quite difficult here in the morning, and yeah, it kind of all depends on the weather.

Q.   Someone did kind of run away with it on the first day; what was your take on that knowing that you were starting and somebody shot the lights out? 
JONAS BLIXT:   It's 54 holes left. 

Q.   And knowing this course just a little now, what is your impression? 
JONAS BLIXT:   I haven't played the first time I spoke to you, and it's kind of tight.   It's breezy and it gets really hard, because balls that you keep underneath the trees don't get affected as much and sometimes you get them up in the air more than you want and the wind just takes it and blows it completely away so we probably look like amateurs completely sometimes. 
No, it's difficult, and you've got to have a very good short game around here because the wind is going to get you sometimes.

Q.   After bracing yourself against the cold, have you noticed the difference between the two days and how it can change?
JONAS BLIXT:   The beginning of the round, it was windy.   The wind was there all day I guess but it was sunny and beautiful for at least six holes, and then it got cold and dark again and then it got rainy.   So you never know what you're going to get.
