 Q.   Jonas, thoughts on the day?   
JONAS BLIXT:   Pretty solid.   Drove it very well with my driver and not trying to really overpower the golf course.   I know it's not really long but it's quite long.   Just try and stay in the fairway as much as I can and putt for birdie as much as I can.   It's been working out pretty well.  
   
 Q.   And looked like the eagle certainly worked out pretty well at your 11th hole, the second, wasn't it?   
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, it's a good drive and don't really know how to add to that.   Second shot, chipped it in.   Hope can show some videos.   
   
 Q.   Even though it the halfway stage, you are aware of the way you've moved up the leaderboard as a result?   
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, if you shoot 4â€‘under on this golf course, you're obviously moving up.   If I can keep doing that, I might have a shot at it on Sunday.  
   
 Q.   Presumably you recall the course from last year, markedly different this time around, isn't it.   Not getting the same low scores?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Well, if you would have been on the golf course, you would have seen in the rough is a lot more gnarly this year.   Any time you drive it in the rough, you're going to have a problem.   So if I can stay out of the rough, I hope I can have a chance on Sunday.
