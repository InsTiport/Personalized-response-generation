 Q.  I have seen you putt well before.  Just 25 putts on that card.  Really nice.  
JONAS BLIXT: Yeah, no, hit it pretty close and got myself a lot of opportunities to make some putts.  I'm very happy about today.   
 Q.  These greens are rolling so pure.  I guess you have a feel for the putting surfaces?  
JONAS BLIXT: Yeah, I didn't putt very well last week, so I kind of put some more time into it this week.  Just putting a little better.  Ball is starting a little more online and got the speed down, so it's looking good for the weekend.   
 Q.  Absolutely.  Was there any technical change made?  Or just got some confidence rolling on the green?  
JONAS BLIXT: Kind of started last week.  Started releasing the putter a little more, but never really made too many putts last week.  It was kind of bumpy with Poa annua.  This week, the greens are so pure.  If you hit a good putt, it's going to go in.   
 Q.  Well done.  You got yourself a later tee time on Saturday.  
JONAS BLIXT: Thank you very much.
