 Q.   Jonas, what gave you the edge in that match?   
JONAS BLIXT:   I think it was quite a battle out there.   I think I made a couple more putts than he did.   I had a turning point there on I think it was 6, and after that, I kind of had the game kind of go my way.   
No, I think it's just a couple putts that snuck in there.  
   
 Q.   Your first of The World Match Play Championship, how is it comparing to expectation?   
JONAS BLIXT:   I think it's great.   It's going to be a lot of people here and there's quite a bit of people here, even on Wednesday, and the golf course is great.   Volvo is taking care of us so well this week, and probably being Swedish, saying that.   So yeah, got nothing to complain about.  
   
 Q.   Is it a golf course that you feel suits your style of play?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, I think it is.   I've been in America for ten years now and it's a very Americanised golf course.   I think Arnold Palmer built it.   There's nothing tricky about it.   You see everything, and yeah, it's nice be to European and American.   Kind of feel at home playing this kind of golf.   
   
 Q.   How much experience have you had of match play in your life?   
JONAS BLIXT:   Obviously we played WGC Accenture and then we played the Palmer Cup.   But since then, like what is it, ten years ago, six years ago, and I haven't played much.   But going out with your buddies, you always play match games, so that always helps.
