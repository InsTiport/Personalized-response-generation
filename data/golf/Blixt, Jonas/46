  JONAS BLIXT:   On the back nine when my family came out.   They're not going to be there tomorrow, but I hope I can play ‑‑ ride on the momentum and play well on the front. 
We'll see what happens.

Q.   I saw them out there.   They were yelling at and you you would come over talking to them.   That got you going, huh?
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, that's nice.   It's a little more relaxed.   I like it when I can talk to people.   You know, sometimes it gets really quiet in the group and that's when I play shitty. 
Don't tell my opponents that.   Hopefully we talk a little bit tomorrow and have a good time.

Q.   Second week in a row you're playing well.   You're really in a groove right now.   The confidence level has to be maybe the highest it's been all year. 
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, I played well in May there and then I got hurt.   I kind of got back to that kind of groove, I hope I can ride it all fall.

Q.   Going to be a shootout on the back nine tomorrow. 
JONAS BLIXT:   Yeah, absolutely.   The front nine is a little harder.   The back nine you can make a couple birdies.   Hopefully I can finish like I did today.

Q.   Do you change any strategy or same game plan you been doing the last few weeks?
JONAS BLIXT:   Make birdies. 

Q.   Make birdies.
JONAS BLIXT:   All the time.   Just make birdies.   We'll see.
