Q. Talk about today's round. 
JONAS BLIXT: It went so fast in the beginning so didn't think about it, and then just completely (indiscernible) up there shot up there 4 through 15. 
Yeah, a little bit of a slow start after 2. Just couldn't get it going. Then made eagle on 8 and just the round got kick started. 
I think me and J.J. kind of set up a (indiscernible) a little bit. He was playing great. I was able to make a couple birdies and knock a couple close and not have to make those long putts.
No, great day. 

Q. What do you feel has been the strength this week for you to get yourself into this position right now? 
JONAS BLIXT: Feel like I've been hitting it pretty well. I think I had like one or two tee shots that's been a little squirrely. That's going to happen here; you just got to deal with it.
After that I been hitting a lot of fairways and giving myself chances to make birdies. The putter is working good. I'm very happy about my whole game. 
Trying to stay aggressive tomorrow. I mean, in the start of the round I wasn't firing‑‑ I was firing at the pins but I wasn't finding the greens. My short game kind of helped me out there.
Then I started being aggressive and started hitting it a lot closer. So if I can keep doing that, I might have a chance tomorrow.

Q. How are you managing the greens and the slopes out there? Pretty challenging or straightforward? 
JONAS BLIXT: It's pretty normal. Bounces sometimes and just got to deal with it. Had a couple putts that I thought was going to go in and just completely bounces out of the hole.
But everybody has to deal with it. Yeah, it's nice. I mean, just keep hitting good putts and some are going to go in.
