 Q.   What was your game plan today?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Just play my game and see where it takes me.   It wasn't pretty today but I think I managed to battle it out.  
   
 Q.   On 18 you were able to get up‑and‑down; did the thoughts really start to churn in your mind there, solidifying your spot for next week?  
JONAS BLIXT:   No, the only thought I had was to make birdie.   I hit a poor approach shot.   It was a decent bunker shot, and I never even thought about it.   
   
 Q.   How is your experience playing this week on a course that has such great history and such tradition, in front of these very exuberant golf fans in the greater New York area?   
JONAS BLIXT:   I love a good test of golf, and everyone was really nice to me.   I heard some stuff about playing here earlier this week, and I haven't seen anything of it.   They have been very positive towards me and towards the guys I've been playing with.   I would love to come back.   
   
 Q.   Will there be some nerves in the coming hours as you watch those FedExCup standings change every so often?   
JONAS BLIXT:   Hopefully not.   I'm trying not to look.   But someone said I should be locked in by now.   But yeah, you never know.
