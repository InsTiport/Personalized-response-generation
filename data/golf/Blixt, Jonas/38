Q.   Around here at the match play, how excited are you to beat Keegan and move on to the second round?
JONAS BLIXT:   It's hard to be excited because I know Keegan pretty well.   It's one of those guys you kind of cheer for.   I was a little heartbroken when I saw I had him in the first match. 
Obviously we're both competitors and I'm very happy to move on.   I'm looking forward to the next match and hope I can make some more putts then.

Q.   When you say you know somebody or you're friendly or you don't want to play them, you still have to beat them.   How are you able to flip the switch off and say we'll be friends in four hours?
JONAS BLIXT:   I think everyone out here has something in common, and that's we don't like to lose.   So it's not very hard.   You just go out there and try to beat him and try to do as much as possible.   That's what makes us so competitive. 

Q.   You don't play match play a lot.   How do you adjust?   How is this whole thing different for you than a normal PGA Tour event?
JONAS BLIXT:   I played a couple of match play matches when I grew up and played a lot in Europe, but I haven't really played a match since college.   So it was different.   It was definitely a little wakeâ€‘up call on the first tee, you know.   But I like it.   It's fun.
