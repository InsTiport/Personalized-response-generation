 Q.   Jonas, nice job keeping pace today.   Talk about the conditions.   
JONAS BLIXT:   A little windier today.   The greens were a little firmer.   It's baking up.   And it's going to be a fun test this weekend.  
   
 Q.   How much does your past experience help you this year at the Masters, in general?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Well, it's been a long Major history with me, so I have 2 underneath my belt, I guess.   
And I just love fast greens.   It's so much fun to play.   And I see the lines better.   There's a lot more touch around the greens.   I can visualize the shots a little bit better.   I really, truly enjoy it.  
You know, experience always helps, but I don't have a lot of it.   I try to do my best and be aggressive.  
   
 Q.   Besides all the crazy stuff that happened today, good and bad, you're still right there, despite what happened on 11 and everything.   You may be in second place by the end of the day if the wind keeps swirling and things keep happening.   Are you right there?   Would you have taken this at the beginning of the day yesterday, this position?  
JONAS BLIXT:   Oh, yeah.   No, absolutely.   This is all you want.   You want to be in contention come Saturday and Sunday.   So I'm very happy with where I'm at for now.   It's right where I want to be, unless I had a 20 shot lead, but that's not going to happen.   Absolutely, you can't ask for anything else in a major championship to be up there and have a chance of winning, it's a cool, cool thing to do.
