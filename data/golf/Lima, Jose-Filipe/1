JOSÃ-FILIPE LIMA: Finished well, 4-under.  I'm happy today.
Q. Run of three birdies in a row, as well, which was nice to get going, having dropped a shot previously.
JOSÃ-FILIPE LIMA: Yeah, it's a good reaction.  Mentally, I just had a reaction.  That's what I was working on; that's why I'm happy.  Disappointed on 17.  I was lucky on 17, actually.
But it's a very good result in my own country.  Very happy.
Q. You and Ricardo Gouveia both up there inside the top five at the moment, for not just the tournament, but Portuguese golf.  That's really good in front of these big crowds here.
JOSÃ-FILIPE LIMA: Yes, exactly.  It's what we are working on, to have more and more players, and now we show two already on top of the European Tour this week.  Just try to do better and better to have more younger players coming.  I think it's a good country for golf and we need some more players now.
Q. Your best result last week and you bettered it this week.  So things going nicely in the right direction now coming towards the end of the season.
JOSÃ-FILIPE LIMA: Yeah, exactly.  I just changed little things in my life.  I just changed my team.  I work with a new physio, new preparation, new physical preparation and new coach.  Everything is new.  The work is good.  It looks like the results are coming quick.  I'm very happy.  I'll just try to keep going with three more weeks to come, and I'm going to try my best.
