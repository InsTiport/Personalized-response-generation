Q. How would you assess your performance?
GAVIN GREEN: It was a very solid round obviously.  I hit a bunch of fairways, a bunch of greens and I didn't really take anything on.  I just kind of hit fairway, greens, and obviously made some putts.  That helped.  5-under, that's a soul little round.
Q. As you see you played some very consistent golf.  What was working especially well for you?
GAVIN GREEN: Keeping tee shots in play.  Not going crazy, just trying to keep it in play.  Especially this course, you have to respect it a lot because the rough can really get you.  Like I said, if you make putts, you're going to shoot a good score.
But like I say, we stayed patient and gave ourselves a lot of looks.  Missed a couple here and there, made a couple of big ones and it evens out and turns out to be a really good day.
Q. The weather took a turn on the back nine.  Did that affect your game much?
GAVIN GREEN: A little bit.  A couple of holes in the wind obviously played a little bit longer, but wasn't too bad.  It was like a 6-iron to a 5-iron but it's only a club, so it wasn't too bad.  Like I said, try to keep it in play all the time.
Q. Going to get a lot worse now actually?
GAVIN GREEN: I'm going to get myself an ice creme.
Q. In this weather?
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, it's hot; where I'm from, it's like this every day.
Q. What are your thoughts going into tomorrow?
GAVIN GREEN: Going to try to do the same thing.  I'm enjoying it as much as I can.  Just going to try to enjoy the moment and play good golf.
