Q. This is the end of your three-week stint where you played some of the biggest events in your career so far?
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, three really good learning weeks.  You know, I'm still learning obviously.  It was tough out there.  I played well a couple of days, two days, and then two days struggled.  I think I've got to learn to get four good rounds, get at least three good rounds.  My struggle rounds can't be 4-, 5-, 6-over.  It's got to be around 1-, 2-over, even.
Like I said, it's just learning for me and experience.  I'm glad this three weeks I got an opportunity to play, but you know, I'm ready to get back on the Asian Tour in Manila.
Q. Playing with the world's best players, what do you think is needed to close the gap?
GAVIN GREEN: I think a lot of it has to do with experience.  I think these three weeks, I've really shown myself that -- the whole three weeks, as it progressed, I've gotten better and better.  Like I said, I think it's just all a bit of experience and a bit of getting used to.
The fans have been great.  I guess they like the long ball.  They are nice and supportive here and in Korea and Malaysia.  I'm just glad I had the opportunity to play and I hope to continue that next year.  A couple of big wins hopefully, yeah.
Q. I guess you'll be happen tee to take a short break before you resume business in Manila?
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, I'll take a week break and go out, hang up the clubs for two or three days and just chill out and then continue on.
