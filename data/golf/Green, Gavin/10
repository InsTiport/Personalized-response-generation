 Q.  74 today and 65 yesterday.  What was the significant difference between the last two days?  
GAVIN GREEN: The last two days, I struggled to hit the fairways today, which led to very difficult second shots out of the rough, and it's tough to control.  I came back with a couple of birdies.   
I grinded hard.  I really tried to stay so patient towards the end just because it's a tough golf course, and nobody's really scoring.  I stayed patient throughout the whole day, and really just tried to give myself many looks.   
 Q.  At this halfway stage of the WGC-HSBC Champions, I'm sure you might be looking to draw a lot of positives and experience to push yourself through over the weekend?  
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, it's been a great three weeks and hopefully finish it off strong.   
 Q.  Where do you hope to see yourself finish come Sunday?  Any targets you've set for yourself?  
GAVIN GREEN: No, I'm just going out there to play my best, and as long as I can get two more under par rounds, that's my target the next to days.
