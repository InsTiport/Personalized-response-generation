 Q.  Your thoughts on a 73 today on a really windy day.  
GAVIN GREEN: I started off a little shaky today.  I didn't hit it very good to start.  I was getting frustrated, and towards the end of the first nine, I was able to flip it around a little bit.  Got two birdies.  Gave myself a lot of looks.  Missed a lot of putts coming down the stretch, but I think the important thing is I gave myself looks and stopped the bleeding, basically.   
I'm enjoying it, so it's good.   
 Q.  Speaking of enjoying it, I think this is your first World Golf Championships.  You're getting a lot of the fans' attention, as well.  
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, the fans are great.  Obviously playing with Wu today and Charl, Wu is a big guy here and the crowd is great.  It's fun and I hope to play more of these.   
 Q.  Obviously I'm sure you'd like to end your three-week stint on a really high note tomorrow.  
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, I'm hoping for an under-par round tomorrow.  That's my goal.  Doesn't matter how many.  I'll just try and go as many as I can.  I think the more important thing for me is I gave myself a lot of looks.
