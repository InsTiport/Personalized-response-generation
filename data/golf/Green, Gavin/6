 Q.  Pretty pleasing going first out this morning and putting a nice score on the board?  
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, it was perfect greens this morning.  Conditions were absolutely perfect.  It was a little shaky to start.  I had a little wrist deal that kind of hurt me the whole year.  Took Wednesday off and came up and felt a little better.   
Very pleased with a 67.  Just kind of grinded away and made some put.  Made some clutch up-and-downs and obviously made some birdies.   
 Q.  Six birdies, two dropped shots, didn't get off to the best start with a bogey on the first but it was a nice recovery in the middle of that front nine.  
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, honestly I didn't even think about it.  But it was just solid playing, hitting fairways, and when we were out, we just kind of played back in play.  Took my two putts.  I had a couple of 3-putts, which is kind of a bummer, but nevertheless, I made some pretty crazy up-and-downs.  So I'll take it 4-under, any day, on this course.   
 Q.  It's been an up-and-down last few weeks, so how nice is it to go out and start one of these big tournaments in strong fashion on the opening day?  
GAVIN GREEN: It's nice.  Kick starts the whole week.  Hopefully just kind of chill out this afternoon, come back tomorrow and do the same thing and we'll see what happens.  It's just the first day.  Hopefully the next few days, keep the same game plan and hit a bunch of greens.  The greens are so good, you can make putts out here.  If I give myself more looks, more will drop.  We'll see.
