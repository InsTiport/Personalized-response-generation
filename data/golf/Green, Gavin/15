Q. 1-under, thoughts on the day?
GAVIN GREEN: I got off to a little shaky start, but I kind of recovered well.  Kept myself in play and I just missed a bunch of putts out there.  I misread them and I think a little bit of the jet-lag kind of kicked in.  Under par round, no practice round, it's okay.  I'll take it.
Still got three more days.  I'll just stay positive and we'll just move on.
Q. Would you describe your eagle on the fifth.
GAVIN GREEN: It was a decent tee shot.  I kept it in play.  You know, second shot, just put it in the middle of the green and saw the putt.  I didn't expect the eagle, but you know, I just thought, give it a chance.  If not, then you make birdie.  Just lucky enough, it went in.  And then back nine, I didn't make much putts.  I struggled a little bit on the back nine, yeah.
Q. Game plan for tomorrow?
GAVIN GREEN: Same.  Just attack.
Q. Struggled with the par 3s today?
GAVIN GREEN: A little bit.  We miss-clubbed a couple and misjudged the wind a little bit, but it's okay.
Q. Is there any holes that you could have done better?
GAVIN GREEN: The par 3s I think.  I struggled a little bit, but I'll get it tomorrow.
Q. What would you say is the positive for the round today?
GAVIN GREEN: Under par is always good, especially fly back -- going to get an early flight home.  It was all right.  I just tried to rest as much as I can and that's all I'm going to try to do now.
Q. Will you be out on the putting green?
GAVIN GREEN: Yeah, I'll hit a little bit, and then I'll putt a little bit and then I'll go home.
