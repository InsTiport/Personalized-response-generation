Q. Well played, another solid round but just going to come up a little bit short on this occasion?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I played great today.  I really did.  But I struggled on the greens.  As well as I played long game, as much as I struggled on the greens.
So extremely pleased about how I played.  But disappointed about how I putted.
Q. Always nice to be hitting a good run of form at this stage of the season, and Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai coming up at the end of the year.
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Sure, it's always nice to play well, doesn't matter what time of the year, but I know what you mean.
I'm obviously really excited.  Little steps; the last 12 months, I've made huge strides, so all in all, very happy.
Q. A massive improvement to your World Ranking, as well?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, like I said earlier, I try not to focus too much on it, but good golf, it takes care of that.  I certainly played well this week.
Q. A final word on the overall experience of playing here at Woburn this week?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  What a great venue, great atmosphere, fantastic facilities.  It's just a joy to come here.  I can't wait to come back.
