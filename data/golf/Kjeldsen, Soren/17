Q. How did you do it there?  8 under par, and you respond from your only bogey on 17 with a birdie at 18.
SOREN KJELDSEN: It was a great round.  I struggled a bit with my iron shots on Friday last week at Wentworth, and I struggled with it on Thursday.
Then yesterday was a little bit better.  Then I made a terrible swing on 9 yesterday, and that swing sort of really helped me a lot because I really felt what happened.  So after the round, I went out to the range and got a really great feeling.
My warmup this morning was fantastic, and I was hitting it fantastically well today.
Q. How excited are you to play so well here at Jack's tournament?
SOREN KJELDSEN: It's fantastic.  It's always been a dream of mine to play this event.  Jack Nicklaus is -- you know, he's the greatest.  And for me, it's an honor to play the event.  I got to say hello to him the other day, which it's a great thrill for me, and to play well on top of that, it's pretty special.
Q. You shoot right to the top of the leaderboard today.  How are you feeling about Sunday now?
SOREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I mean, now I'll go and have some lunch and enjoy myself a little bit and then do some practice.
You know, today is today and tomorrow is tomorrow, but I was really pleased with the way that I sort of worked out what I struggled with early on iron play and enjoyed those quality shots today.  It was nice.
