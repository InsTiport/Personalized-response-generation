  Q. SÃ¸ren, two round of 69, compare your play over the two days.   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: It was a little bit shorter today I thought, but funny enough, I probably didn't feel I played quite as well today as I did yesterday. I didn't drive the ball as I did yesterday.   
 But I had a couple, like on 16, I hit it through the back and had a really tough shot and chipped that in and stuff like that. So I had a few things going for me today. I hit a couple of bad drives where I sort of got away with it.  
  
  Q. What's the most difficult aspect in these conditions?  
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: It's obviously the greens. The greens are in the afternoon a little spongier, and so you're not quite sure how they are going to bounce when you pitch into them, and when you are on the green, as well, after all of the traffic, you can obviously get a few footprints out there. Around the green really is the tricky bit.   
  
  Q. You've been coming here, this is your 11th year, did you prefer the course before the changes or after?   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: I think when they made the changes, I wasn't really a big fan, but I like it now. I actually think it's better now. They are good changes. I think you have to drive the ball better than you used to, and therefore, it's a better test.   
  
  Q. How are you feeling now about your position going into the weekend?   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I feel great, just to play well again after the last two rounds in Ireland last week was a little disappointing.   
 I'm staying at home this week and I'm playing good.
