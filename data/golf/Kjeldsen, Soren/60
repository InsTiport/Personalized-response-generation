 Q. Assessment? 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: I wouldn't say it was a good bad day but I hit quite a lot of bad shots and got away with it. Made some good putts. Overall, like I said yesterday, at some stage on this course, you're going to battle a little bit, and I did that today and I think I did quite well.

 Q. And you've come back and still leading, considering the conditions. 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I was disappointed as everybody sitting around. It was nice to get back into it and I feel really good. 
 I might be out with Westwood, but we'll probably play threeballs, so probably be out with Garcia and Westwood, all three of us, good group.
