 Q. Thoughts?
 SOREN KJELDSEN: I was happy with that. I played pretty good the whole day but nothing was seeming to happen but then I got it going on the back nine so it was a good test of patience - I thought I did pretty good.

 Q. You had a good finish here last year, this is supposed to be a bomber's course but you are not a long hitter?
 SOREN KJELDSEN: Everybody seems to think it is a bomber's course but I don't know. I just like it, I like the place and it seems to suit me eye. Like you said I had a good year here last year and I feel really comfortable here.

 Q. Thoughts on tomorrow?
 SOREN KJELDSEN: I haven't really thought about it. Today was definitely a lot harder than Thursday or Friday so right now I am pleased that I got the job done and posted a decent score. Tomorrow is tomorrow - it is far away at the moment!
