 Q. It was a real stirring fight and you looked as if you had a point to prove, all of you today, and you've done it. 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, first three days was very disappointing and it was like Thomas said before we went out, we played for our pride today, and I decided not to look at the boards. I wasn't really aware of what was going on, but we all sort of had something to prove today. Overall, I think we are disappointed but at least we are happy about the way we played today. 

 Q. It looks as if yesterday was the key, there was nothing between you Thursday, Friday, but it just went yesterday. There was no way back from it. 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Exactly, but fair play to them. They played well all week. The made a lot of putts. Short game has been very sharp on their side, and in match play, that's what counts, and they were too strong for us this time but we'll be back.

 Q. You wanted to get the point, as well, didn't you. 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Exactly, three matches and no points, I didn't feel very good about that, and you know, at least I got one today.
