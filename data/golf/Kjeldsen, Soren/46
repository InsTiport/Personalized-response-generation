  SÃREN KJELDSEN: I played very good last week in France after make a couple of months where it wasn't so good, so it was important for me to keep that going and get off to a good start. 
18 was probably the worst hole I played.   Apart from that, I got it in play, hit a lot of shots close and made a few putts.   It was one of those days where you think, why don't I do this every day.   Let's just enjoy it.

Q.   I think everybody would hesitate to say, that it isn't easy but there are opportunities and it's fairly benign. 
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, this course is really not built for conditions like this in mind because it doesn't happen very often, so to have no wind and no rain, it was as easy as it can get here today. 
But the thing is, this is a great golf course and I think the only thing for me is that I hope people don't say, yeah, the course is too easy, because it's not. 
It's a great golf course and it's built in an area where you normally get a lot of wind and sometimes you get a bit of rain.   You know, I think it's important not to take anything away from the golf course just because we had perfect conditions today.

Q.   And it looks like a very fair track; if you're playing well, you'll get your rewards and it's good for the second shots in particular.   But if you're in the rough on the bunkers, it's treacherous. 
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Absolutely.   I think it really is a great design, and it's a really good golf course, and I hope that if we get more weather like this and we get a low winning score, please don't change too much, because it's a great golf course already. 
You know, like I think, my personal opinion, is to put the tee back on 12.   I thought it was a better hole before.   Now, the sort of run‑in to the green is not too much in play because most people are going to hit their third shots into the green now instead of their second shot.   So sometimes like that; I think the architecture of this course is amazing and they shouldn't really fiddle much with it.

Q.   On the subject of scoring, give me an appraisal of 62 from Francesco Molinari?
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   What he did on Sunday, and I suppose after that, no one is going to be too surprised that he did what he did today.   When he gets going, he's amazing, and wish him the best. 

Q.   You're getting going, and you reflected on France, that looked a nice solidity there. 
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, it was nice, because I had not really played well since I played well at the Spanish Open. 
It was a bit too long and I needed a good week and it was nice last week.   Coming into this week, just feeling slightly more relaxed because of what happened last week.   So, it was good. 

Q.   Any reason for it or just one of those vagaries of golf?
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   To be fair, I missed the cut in Ireland, and went down to my coach in Portugal.   I think we did some good work there, and the guy that helps me with my weird mind, he came to France and we did a bit of work Thursday and Friday.   He mentioned a few good things, and you know, I think since then, probably mentally, I've been a little bit better. 

Q.   Weird mind?   Tying yourself in knots over things? 
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, I'm just a golfer, I don't think I'm that different to most golfers.   We are sort of a bit loony sometimes.
