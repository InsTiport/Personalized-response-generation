 Q.   SÃ¸ren, let's get the nasty stuff out of the way, first of all, how frustrating to finish with a six; what happened with that shot?   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, I had 94 meters and the breeze was quite strong into and I hit my 52 wedge 106, so it was perfect, playing just over a hundred I felt and it just ballooned on me a little bit.   I was trying to hit it close.   
I played really well all day, and felt confident over the shot, and you know, after the round, I said to Kevin, should we just play ten feet left and give myself a putt to go to 7‑under.   
But you know, I see myself as a good wedge player, so I wanted to hit it stiff.  
   
 Q.   What about the total, 5‑under par, you've seen what's happened with GrÃ©gory, how do you feel about your chances?   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Well, I mean, obviously 15 is a great chance, but then after that, I mean, 16, 17, 18, especially 16, is very tough.   
So I mean, you wouldn't say it's certainly birdie holes after you've played 15.   But you know, the guys are playing well; who knows.  
   
 Q.   What will you do now?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I'm going to see my son.   He's been encouraging me all the way around.   We've had so much fun this week.   
   
 Q.   Thoughts on coming from well off the pace into this lovely position?   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   It was weird, because I mean, the first three days, I felt like I struggled with most of my game.   I suppose my putting kept me in it for the first three days, and my caddie, Kevin, he gave me a little speech this morning and said, it's a tough golf course, going to be windy again, make your pars; if you get a birdie here and there, it's not going to take that low a number to get in the mix.   
So good little speech for him, and then for some strange reason, I came out and hit it beautifully today.  
   
 Q.   So even from seven back, you thought, there's an opportunity here?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   To be honest with you, I didn't really think that.   I suppose when I birdied 15 to get to 5‑under, I was thinking, you know, if I can sneak one more, then maybe I've got a chance.   
But to be honest with you, because I didn't play so well the first three days, I was good at being in the moment, it was fun to play well, and I haven't been doing that all the time recently.  
So I wasn't too worried about what score, whatever.   I was just enjoying playing good golf.  
   
 Q.   And whatever happens from here, it bodes well, doesn't it?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, I know, it's just really nice.   It's a weird game.   On Friday I said to Linda in recorders, with three holes to go, I said to Kevin, I was going to walk off the course, I was that frustrated.   And you know, 2 1/2 days later, I stand here, it's weird, really weird.  
I think what I've learned, again, this week, I suppose is that don't try to work the game out.   You know, you've got to play it and then you have to take whatever you get, and sometimes it just messes with you and it did with me this week, and it gave me something back today, I don't know why.
