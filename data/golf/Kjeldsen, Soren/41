 Q.   How good was that today?   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, it was really good.   I started playing great yesterday, as well, and I did again today.   Very solid.   Made a few, missed a few, but seemed to have chances pretty much on every hole.   
You know, conditions were as good as you can get, no wind, and it was just really enjoyable.  
   
 Q.   It's easy, isn't it?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   No, it's not, but when you're playing well, it certainly seems easier.   But we just had a really good day, and with my playing partner, we've had a great time, so I've been fortunate in that respect, as well.  
   
 Q.   The combined effect is a lovely position in this tournament.   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Absolutely.   Everything the last two days has just been stress free and a lot of fun.   It doesn't happen often, so when it does, you might as well enjoy it.  
   
 Q.   How does it compare to how you've played this event in the past; what's your best here?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I think I've only finished in the Top‑10 I think once.   I think historically, I haven't done well around St. Andrews for some reason.   I always seem to shoot just around par, and the guys shoot good scores here normally, and I've always struggled to see that.  
So this was by far my best round around here.   But Carnoustie and Kingsbarns I've played well in the past.   Mixed bag like most golf tournaments.  
   
 Q.   Struggling in the past, does that mean with the time, the experience, that the nuances are coming home a bit more?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I don't know.   Sometimes experience is a good explanation for something, and sometimes‑‑ I've got a the low of experience now, but sometimes that hurts me, as well.   I hit a lot of bad shots on a lot of holes.   I think it works sort of both ways.   
But I think one thing that's maybe helped me a little bit so far is that I've been playing a lot recently, and because I played the tournament so many times, I didn't feel like I really needed to see the courses again.   It was nice to have a bit of a break before this tournament and sort of get away from it for a few days, so I've enjoyed that.  
   
 Q.   Playing a lot but playing pretty well, and your position on that Order of Merit means kick on and you could have Dubai to come?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, definitely, I'd love to play Dubai.   I've played a few times now and it's a great tournament.   It's sort of like if you're playing that tournament, your season hasn't been too bad.   So it would be really nice to make that, but you've got to keep your head down and play one shot at a time.
