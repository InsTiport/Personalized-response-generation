 Q.   How did you enjoy things out there?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I really did.   I think the reason why I surprised you a little bit yesterday was I felt like I wasted maybe one or two shots.   So after the round yesterday, I wasn't 100 percent happy even though I knew I shot a good score.   Today was very rewarding because I putted really well today, which is something I haven't really been doing.   I needed that today because actually I think finishing on the front nine here today, I think was the toughest of the nine holes I've played for the two rounds.   So the putter saved me a lot and I still hit the ball really well, but I felt like I kept the score more under control today and too many dropped shots yesterday.  
   
 Q.   And you had a good foundation with those two birdies in the first three holes, and another one just after the turn.   It was looking very sweet out there.   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   To be honest with you, coming back in 1‑over par, it was a really good effort.   There was so much crosswind on the front nine.   I hit some good shots that just couldn't keep the green at all.   So putter saved me and you know what that's like.   That nearly feels like semi‑cheating sometimes.   I got the most out of it today and that's really pleasing.   I didn't feel I quite did that yesterday.  
   
 Q.   There have been other examples in your career of thriving on the hard courses.   Is this something that you do enjoy, that kind of challenge?   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I think if you have got to sort of categorise my game, I think I hit it pretty straight off the tee and my short game is generally pretty strong.   So I think that sets up nicely for tough golf courses.   I kept it in play nicely and when I get that putter going, I can keep the score under control.   
   
 Q.   As joint leader, you'll keep things under control over the weekend, aren't you?   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I'm certainly going to try.   It's been really challenging these two days but I've absolutely loved it.   I've had a great time out there, so I'm just looking forward to the weekend.
