Q. How difficult is it to switch from these conditions and then move forward into the next major?  It's going to be very different?
SOREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, it couldn't be more different.  But I think it's one of the beauties of the European Tour.  We play a lot of different courses.  We play in Asia.  I played quite a bit in America this year.  We play Scottish Open.  We play in Ireland and stuff like that, so we're used to it.  I think for the Americans maybe it's a bit more different.  But for us, we're changing grasses all the time, climates, whatever.  So for us it's part of the deal.
Q. The Americans have been talking about the greens a lot and how slow they are.  Is that a big factor for you this week or not very different?
SOREN KJELDSEN: Not really.  When you get 35, 40-mile-per-hour winds, you can't have greens 12 on the Stimpmeter.  You'd make it unplayable.  So there is no other option.  You have to have them at 9 or maybe 10 at the most, and that's what most links courses are.
I think they're rolling pretty true.  They're good greens, and you just can't have them any quicker.
