 Q.   Are you every bit as satisfied as you were with the first day?   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, definitely.   The thing is, here, I mean, if you hit a couple of bad shots, you're really in trouble.   So you go out there and sort of prepare yourself to deal with stuff, and these first two days, I haven't really had to deal with a lot of stuff, so that's been nice.   
But you know, over four days, you've got to deal with stuff, because you're going to hit a couple of bad shots, and when you do, you really get in trouble.   
But so far, so good.   It's been pretty stress‑free, so it's been nice.   
   
 Q.   Sounds like the state of mind is accurate and spot‑on, as well as the golf itself?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I think so.   It's been a big thing for me this year.   I think certainly beginning of the year, I was probably putting too much pressure on myself.   You know, we are all like that.   
All golfers are like that I suppose and I think recently, I've just taken the top away from that, so it seems like I'm enjoying it a little bit more and staying a little bit more patient.   You know, you hear guys saying that every week, and it certainly is a game of that.   
   
 Q.   Only the halfway stage, I shouldn't ask this, but are you ready to win again?   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Don't know.   I mean, the three times that I've won out here, I didn't know if I was ready to win or not.   It just turned out that way, but I think that you have to stay humble about these things.   
You do your thing and do the best you can.   Nobody's going to tackle you.   Nobody's going to steal your ball, hopefully, so you just play your ball and on Sunday you add up and see how you've done.  
   
 Q.   Certainly on those three occasions you did win, there were plenty of signs in the weeks and months beforehand, that the game was good, a solidity week‑in and week‑out and that's where you're getting back to.   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   Yeah, I think so, and I haven't really been in contention in any tournaments this year, so this is a massive bonus.   
So you're not going to get me to talk about winning and stuff like that, certainly not now.   I'm just enjoying playing good golf, and hopefully I can keep going.  
   
 Q.   You seem to enjoy being back with Woody, you were with him as caddie for many a year, split up and now back in success again.   
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   We had six fantastic years, and then we just need a little bit of a break, and we had two years, and you realize sort of what you miss about the guy.   You know, I think he's perfect for me.   He's very calm.   He's got a great outlook on life, and I think, you know, for a caddie, you need a little bit of perspective.   Especially when the player isn't so happy and he thinks that the world depends on his golf game, because I certainly feel a bit like that sometimes, ridiculous as it may sound.   
But Kevin is so good with that, and he calms me down and he's got a massive influence on me.
