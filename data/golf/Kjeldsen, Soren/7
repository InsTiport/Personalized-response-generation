SOREN KJELDSEN: I actually hit a decent drive on the second, but it just didn't take long to get 2-down.
Q. All square through nine, and then into the back nine.  How tough was the back nine?
SOREN KJELDSEN: Very tough.  It was actually -- Emiliano was in a good position on 10 and I managed to make a very long putt.  After that I sort of got a little bit of momentum.
Q. You are now guaranteed, because you get the bye because of Gary Woodland, to get straight into the final 16 on Saturday.  How pleasing is that?
SOREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, very pleased.  Actually not happy about Gary and what's going on with Gary.  I don't know the details, but Gary is one of the nicest guys out here.  So we wish him all the best, and his family all the best.
Q. So what will you do on Friday?  What will you do tomorrow?
SOREN KJELDSEN: The weather forecast isn't great.  I've got my two boys here.  We're just going to take it easy.  If the weather is decent in the afternoon I'll come and practice a bit.  Apart from that, I'll just enjoy it.
Q. This is a round robin situation, you kind of wait and see what everyone else does.  It changes dramatically when you get to Saturday.  It's straight knock out.
SOREN KJELDSEN: Yes, it is.  But right now I'm very pleased to make it through.  Obviously I was in a very, very, very tough group.  And I got through that.
