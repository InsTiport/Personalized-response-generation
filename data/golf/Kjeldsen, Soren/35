 Q.  You've been in good form and carried that on today.  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, conditions were great this morning.  No wind really for the first about 12, 13 holes, something like that.  I took advantage.  I hit it decently, sort of long game but my short game was really good.  Chipped in once and made a putt from off the green and made a lot of good putts.   
So it was a really good scoring day.  I probably didn't play quite as well as the scoring reflected but I'll take that.   
 Q.  Carrying on with the confidence from the win in Ireland?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: I'm working harder than I have been before and having Alastair on the bag has been great.  He's come in with a lot of energy and belief in me, so that's been good.  And you know, suddenly confidence is coming back slowly and then yeah, it's been a different game.   
 Q.  What about this week, it's obviously a lot of fun to play with the Amateur partners and on three great courses?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, it is.  It's a great event.  I've been fortunate to play with Jerry for about eight or nine years in a row.  We've had a great time and it's always a pleasure.  You meet a lot of nice people here and everybody is looking forward to coming back and when we get weather like this, it's a special event.   
 Q.  Looking forward to St. Andrews tomorrow?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, always.  I didn't play my best at The Open this year, so hopefully I can get a little revenge tomorrow.
