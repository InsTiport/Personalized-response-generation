   SÃREN KJELDSEN: Paul was always going to have the advantage getting on the green in two, so I knew I had to -- I hit a great wedge shot from 98 metres. I thought it was good, but it was a long way, too far.   
 So I was very disappointed when I got up there and saw it was about -- probably close to 30 feet, ten paces. But then I got a good putt, so very happy.  
  
  Q. How about the emotions during that round, 3-up, back to level, you're 3-up, back again.   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: I didn't play very well this morning, so I was happy to get a good start there. To be honest with you, I knew Paul was always going to try and come back and play some good golf, and he did.  
 But the turning point was probably the bunker shot I hit on 12. He was in good position there and I hit in the left trap and hit a great bunker shot.   
  
  Q. Your match this afternoon, seems that you both were fighting quite strongly.   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, we were. To be fair, I played pretty good on the front nine and Paul came back. You know, I hit a bad drive on 8 and made a bad bogey on 10. But apart from that, you have to make birdies to win holes and I didn't make too many mistakes.   
 So it was very much momentum was swinging the whole time. I won the first three holes and then Paul nearly came back at the end. It was an interesting day. It was typical match play, a little bit of momentum in one direction and off you go.   
  
  Q. How do you feel for tomorrow?   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: You know, generally when I play my best, I don't make too many mistakes. I had two weeks off before this week, and came out and felt a little bit rusty on a few shots this morning. Then I came out and played better this afternoon, and pretty happy about winning my round this afternoon.
