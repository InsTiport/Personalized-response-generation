   SOREN KJELDSEN:  Well, I played great.  I played pretty good the first three days, but I got it going today and started making a few putts.  Conditions were really good, but it was nice to play a good round. 

 Q.  Were conditions different after the delay? 
 SOREN KJELDSEN:  Well, it was very windy when we came out and then it died down completely the last few holes.  It was sort of a mixed bag today. 

 Q.  Are you going to stick around? 
 SOREN KJELDSEN:  No, no, I've got a 9:45 flight back to London. 

 Q.  How big of a relief is that? 
 SOREN KJELDSEN:  It's great.  I mean, we wanted to finish because, I mean, you don't want to -- even though I took a 6 at the last, you don't want to stop on that hole tomorrow.  It was nice to finish and get back home.
