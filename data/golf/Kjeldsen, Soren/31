Q. That's your third post-70 round this week.  How tough did you find it today?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I don't think it was that different really today.  I think the greens for some reason, because we were in the last group, they weren't quite as smooth as yesterday morning.  But the course played great.  It's drying out slowly, so a pleasure to play.
Q. With 16 players within five shots of the lead, still a long way to go in this tournament going into the final day?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, for sure.  But it's a quality golf course and therefore, it's going to be a quality finish, as well.  But you know, you can get going here.  It's still pretty soft, so if you drive it well, you can leave yourself a lot of chances.  So I need to play a little bit better tomorrow.
Q. You've won already this year at The Irish Open.  How much will that experience help you tomorrow?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, it's nice to say to yourself that you've been in this situation before and you've sort of come through that.  So I'm going to use that for something positive.  Apart from that, I've got to concentrate on what I'm doing and hopefully play well.
