Q.   You're the first man to break 70.   Tell us how you did it. 
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I'm playing really solid today.   I think I hit 16 greens.   I think I hit most of the fairways.   I didn't have like really strong flight on my driver, but I hit it very straight today and that's what you've got to do around here.   And my iron shots were pretty good. 
Didn't make a whole lot of putts, but I just had a couple of chances, made those and the rest I've been putting from 20 feet and 2‑putting a lot.   It was as stress‑free as you'll get in golf and doesn't happen very often.

Q.   Give us a sense of how the course is playing, a lot of big numbers out there today. 
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   The thing is, if you hit it wide, you're probably never going to see it again, and you've got that, I would guess, ten, 12 holes.   During your round, most of the time, you will hit one or two wide, and you really get in trouble. 
It's my favourite golf course of the whole year.   I just love it here.

Q.   Why is it your favourite?
SÃREN KJELDSEN:   I think the design is the best I've ever seen, and I think, you know, each shot‑‑ what I actually find in a weird way easy here is you cannot sort of think about what has gone wrong, because every shot you have to be on the ball and I like that.   You don't have like a second shot on a par 5 where you lay up, where you just can hit it anywhere.   So every shot, you've got to be 100 per cent concentrated and I like that.
