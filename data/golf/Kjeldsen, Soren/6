 Q.  5 & 4 win over Billy McGirt.  That's good for you.  
SOREN KJELDSEN: That was good.  I played really well.  After the day off yesterday, it was nice to come out and start with a birdie.  I got straight back into the rhythm.  I played really solid today.   
 Q.  Could that be tricky, not playing today, a complete break?  
SOREN KJELDSEN: It shouldn't be.  You never know, little things can change this game in a heartbeat.  I was pleased to come out and get started again.   
 Q.  You will be heading into this afternoon and sometimes it's nice to finish off a match in style?  
SOREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I hit a really good wedge on 14.  It was a perfect number, so I could go straight at it and I did and it worked out nice.   
 Q.  What's good about your game right now?  
SOREN KJELDSEN: Everything really.  I'm striking the ball really well.  I've been putting well the last month.  Overall I feel calm and comfortable.   
 Q.  Are you looking forward to this afternoon?  
SOREN KJELDSEN: Absolutely.  Obviously Jon is playing great, so it will be great fun.
