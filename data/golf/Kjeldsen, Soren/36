Q. You shot an opening round of 69, four birdies and then three bogeys.  Give us a sense of how you played today.SOREN KJELDSEN: I played nicely.  I got off to a bit of a rocky start.  Bogeyed 10, a pretty easy hole, and again made bogey out of nowhere on 12. Two birdies on 11 and 13.  After the birdie on 13 -- 13 is not a particularly easy hole -- I sort of settled after that, and then I think I played okay. I didn't play great, but I had a couple of nice up-and-downs, and I think I was putting better then I have recently.  All in all, it was pretty good.Q. What about playing conditions today?  They look ideal.SOREN KJELDSEN: It's perfect.  I don't think you'll get this close -- much easier than it was today really.  I was really pleased when I got in and saw the fairways were a little firmer than they normally are.  If this course is playing really soft, it's monster long.  I don't get many 340s on a daily basis.  So I was pleased about that. I think the rough will slag you down.  You've got a shot into the green, and you obviously lose a lot of spin on that.  You've sort of got to chase it in there.  I think the way it's playing right now is just perfect.Q. You haven't been eligible to play in World Golf Championships for three or four years.  How excited were you to be coming back?SOREN KJELDSEN: Super excited.  Turning 40, and not, like you said, playing for a few years, you wonder if that was it, whether you're going to make it back to this form.  So far it's been brilliant, and I'm just enjoying it.Q. You were 300th in the world going into the Irish Open, and you're now 79.  Presumably, your eyes are on the top 50.SOREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I've been there before, and I want to go there again.  I've always said, if I don't play my best golf between 40 and 50, then I don't use my experience for anything.  That's my plan, and I'm going to stick to that.
