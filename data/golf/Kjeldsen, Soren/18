Q. How important was it to finish in such wonderful style like that?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: I don't know the importance of it.  It felt great and it put a smile on my face, that's for sure.  It's lovely.  I hit a great drive, hit a great second shot, and hit a beautiful putt there, so nice way to finish.
Q. It's worth stressing that despite the worst of the weather being in the morning, you've still had strong winds to contend with, haven't you?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, Rory on the last hole he hit 9-iron 115 on one hole and 185 on another hole.  That's pretty strong wind right there.  It was great conditions to play in, lots of wind.  The course was playing beautifully.
Q. As defending champion, have you enjoyed playing with the marquee group with the host in front of home crowds?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, it's always great to play with Rory and Andy.  They are two great guys, great games, and we enjoyed it out there.  It was a good three ball.
