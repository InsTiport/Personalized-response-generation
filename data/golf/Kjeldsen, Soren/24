 Q.  What is your verdict on another hard-fought match against the Malaysians?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: They made a lot of putts.  Well-played match again.  We had a lot of chances and a lot of holes that we missed and they made for halves, and it was nice to turn it around at the end.  Victor's putt on 17 was massive.   
 Q.  Do you feel the tension in situations like this when it's going down to the wire once again?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: At the beginning of the match, I knew it would be hard again today.  Yeah, as SÃ¸ren said, we've been in many times in birdie position and then par position, and we were just making putts.  They made up-and-down on every hole today.  They didn't give us any opportunity and we had to create them.  I think we played well again.   
 Q.  This is akin to a CUP match that goes to extra time and then the re-play.  You need penalty shootout now, don't you?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Seems that way.  They are really good players, both of them.  They are good on this grass, especially around the greens, and they are just incredible at getting up-and-down.  We played solid and didn't make enough putts; and therefore, it was a very even competition.   
 Q.  Are you conscious how important a halve-point can be?  
VICTOR DUBUISSON: Yeah, it makes all the difference at the end of the day.  So you know, in this format, even half a point is.
