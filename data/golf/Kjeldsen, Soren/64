   SØREN KJELDSEN:  Having played Valderrama, a few times, I really had that sort of behind set going into today, that it's possible.   
  
  Q.  Is that as good a round of golf as you've ever played?   
 SØREN KJELDSEN:  It's been tough, obviously very tough conditions.  Obviously disappointed to make par at the last.  It's playing very tough out here and there's not a lot of sand in the bunkers.   
 But overall, I was very happy.   
  
  Q.  What was your thinking on 18?   
 SØREN KJELDSEN:  I was going to try to hit it 15 feet right and try to make birdie.  The thing is, you have the wind from the left and you start in the middle of the green, you can easily go further right and I wanted to hit a good shot.  I wanted to give myself a chance.   
 So I felt my mind-set was right.  I just didn't pull the shot off.   
  
  Q.  What did you hit off the last fairway there?   
 SØREN KJELDSEN:  I hit 6-iron.   
  
  Q.  Overall how would you view this week, in such difficult conditions?   
 SØREN KJELDSEN:  Yeah, I like playing in the wind and I think this course suits me really well.  It's been fantastic.  Whatever happens, these five minutes, I've had a wonderful time.
