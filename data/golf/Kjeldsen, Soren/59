   MARÃA ACACIA: SÃ¸ren, congratulations, a bit of a long week but fantastic. 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: It was a long week. The weather had been troubling us but fantastic, though, to finish the tournament like this. This tournament deserved it, and finishing on the Sunday is just the right way to end it. 
 The tournament deserved a finish like today in the sun with the people out. It was a very special atmosphere and obviously nerve-wracking for me but a very special day and hopefully people had a good time. 
 MARÃA ACACIA: Can you repeat what you said at the TV presentation and the driving range; what did your little boy say to you? 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: The year when Tiger won, it was me and my son came up to me and said, "Oh, great, Tiger is out, then you can start winning, Daddy." 
 I kept telling him that Tiger was the best, so he wasn't too happy about that, and there was no trophy for me. 
 MARÃA ACACIA: Can you comment on your round, please. 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: I played fairly solid in the beginning. Nothing spectacular, and then I came up on 11, I saw Martin had made a few birdies, got to 8-under and I was 8-under at the time and birdied 11 and 12, they were sort of key. I tried not to look too much at the board but it pretty difficult. 
 And then I made a good bogey on 16 in the end. Suddenly it was so much up to me really; that probably made it even more difficult. It wasn't just firing at everything. It was just I had a big lead suddenly and made sort of a little bit of a conservative bogey on 17 which made it a little exciting going down the last. It was pretty special, and I don't think I've ever felt so nervous in my life. 

 Q. Second last year, that's a good way to make up for it, winning wire-to-wire; being second last year, did that have anything to do with the extra feeling that you wanted to win it this year? 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, absolutely, especially after playing last week in Valencia, I felt good coming into it. And I had that unbelievable round on Thursday which put me in the driving seat a little bit. 
 Then conditions got a little better. I was quite lucky with the way the weather turned out. I didn't play when it was the worst weather. Sometimes you get on the right side of the draw; I did this week. 
 From then on, nothing much happened, but when I needed to make something happen, the birdies on 11 and 12 today were pretty special, and when I came up and saw on the last hole that I didn't get a plugged lie in the bunker like I did last year, I felt that maybe cost me the trophy a bit last year. I came up and hit a bad second shot again today, but today I had a good lie, so took a bit of the pressure off. 

 Q. When you play that well on a tough course, is it a bit of a puzzle to you that you don't win more often? 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Winning is not easy. There's a lot of good players out here. I mean, apart from Tiger, there's not a lot of people that seem to win a lot. I think that's the way this game is. A lot of things have to go right for you, and you know, one win like this in a year, I'll take that. I'll have a few years like that and I'm happy. 

 Q. In that respect,  780,000, that's almost as much as you earned in your first four years on Tour. Will you buy a new house? 
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: It's an awful lot of money. What can you say? But we all know it's a big tournament and a strong field, and when that happens, it seems like prize money is pretty high, as well. 
 So I've got no complaints about that, either. 
 MARÃA ACACIA: Congratulations. Thank you very much.
