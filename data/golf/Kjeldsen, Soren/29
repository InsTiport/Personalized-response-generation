Q. 8-under par out there.  How does it feel and how did it all feel for you?
SOREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, good.  I played really well last week and it was a little bit of a -- I birdied the first two, and then I was slow for a little period there, and then I finished strongly.  Made a couple nice putts at the end, so it was good.
Q. You were out here when I was playing, which feels like a long ago now.  You seem to be getting better and better.  You moved from England over to Denmark, back home.  How much has that helped your golf?
SOREN KJELDSEN: I think it's helped a lot.  I think the family settled really nicely.  And home is home.  We loved being in Escot for 11 years, but I really enjoy being home.
Q. I've never called any caddie out on the European Tour a B grade caddy, but you certainly have an A grade caddie.  How much has he helped?
SOREN KJELDSEN: Tremendously.  I've got the best caddie in the world, no question about it.  Ellister has been amazing.  He got on the bag in Spain, finished Top-10 that week and I've been pretty much flying sense.
Q. You've got a few shots to catch up tomorrow.  We think we're going to get off to a round at 8 o'clock.  Shotgun start, we had one of those back in 1994 at the Czech Open.  You've got some work to do to catch up.  How do you go about that?
SOREN KJELDSEN: First of all, I'm just really pleased that they do it that way, because I think it's the right way.  It gives us the best chance to finish and get as much golf in as possible.
I don't worry too much about the guys in front.  I've played nicely the last two days and I need to keep doing the same.
