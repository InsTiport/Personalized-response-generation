 Q.  Special feeling to pitch up on 16 in that fantastic atmosphere, first time you birdied it this week?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yes, I even mentioned this last night in the interviews, that I had not birdied it yet.  I was hoping to get it today and it was nice.   
 Q.  Overall how would you assess how the week's gone?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: It's been great.  Obviously a little bit of a pity today with the weather.  Quite a few people stayed which was nice to see but overall I think the tournament's been a huge success.  I think with the music at night, I didn't think it could get any better after last year, but they managed to pull it off.   
 Q.  In terms of the way you've played, you played three great rounds here and just a little blip yesterday.  You must be very pleased with your game at the moment?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I'm very happy.  I thought this week was definitely better than the last three weeks I've played.  A lot of positive stuff.  Yeah, overall, I'm very happy.   
 Q.  And of course Ryder Cup Captain's picks coming up this week.  You've played in the mix this week with people that are involved.  Do you think you've done enough to be seriously considered?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: I don't know.  I try not to speculate too much.  I've given my everything.  That's all I can ask and then it's up to the captain to decide.
