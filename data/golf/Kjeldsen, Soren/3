Q. Pleased with that?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I just hit a lot of decent shots I thought and made a lot of nice putts.  It was all in all a very nice day.
Q. Is this a golf course you have to have a certain amount of patience on?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I think you do on most golf courses.
But I think what I really like about this golf course is how the greens are sort of sectioned off.  If you hit good shots, they land close to the hole and if you hit a poor shot you're going to have a pretty tough up-and-down.  I really like that.  I think you need to be in control of your game, and it's a good test out here.
Q. 68 and 69 over the first two days, what's pleased you most?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: I just feel really happy and comfortable on the course.  This is the second week that I've got Janet on the bag, and I really enjoy her company.  I really enjoy our rounds out there.  She's made a huge difference I think.
Basically, I would say that probably the work with Janet is probably the most pleasing.
Q. Obviously being the final Rolex Series of the year, plenty of points on offer, and you're just inside the Top-50.  It would be a nice boost to climb a few more places in the rankings?
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, for sure.  I would like to get into the Top-50 in the world.  Augusta is my favorite tournament in the world, at the same time with the open.  Obviously for me it's a big target to try and get into that Top-50 before April time.
