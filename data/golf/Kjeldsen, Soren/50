  Q. Good start.   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I played really solid all day. Didn't make a whole lot of putts, and then made that big one on the last.   
  
  Q. What distance?  
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Must have been about 40 feet or so.   
  
  Q. Approach?   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: I hit driver and then I hit a rescue.   
  
  Q. That made the scoreboard look very nice?  
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, because like I said, I played well and then maybe a couple of putts that could have dropped, and then got that nice finish. I thought 67 was a good reflection of how I played.   
  
  Q. What about this day in Scotland?  
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Incredible. I was hot out there today, and I had two layers on and I was hot. I remember playing in 60 and being freezing cold. It was a beautiful day.   
  
  Q. Asking everybody about The Ryder Cup, did you watch it?  
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: I watched every minute of it.   
  
  Q. Did you?   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, did, yeah.   
  
  Q. Every minute of the rain, as well?  
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, I couldn't get on with my life even when it rained. No, it was incredible. Obviously Europe winning, but I just thought the whole event, the atmosphere and all that, I really felt, you know, that week I really felt golf is really a special game. It wasn't just, you know, obviously great Europe winning and the way it happened and all that was terrific, but I just thought, we really have something here that's, you know, that you don't see in other sports.   
  
  Q. Everyone's coverage of it, it was one of the greatest sporting events of all time.   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Exactly. And I think you also have to give credit to the American players, because I mean, quite a few of them seem to enjoy a bit of banter on the first tee and all that. You know, they didn't have to take it like that, and they did. I thought overall it was just fantastic.   
  
  Q. Does that positivity filter through The European Tour?   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Absolutely, yeah. I think everybody feels happy to be a part of it. You know, and having an event that stands out like that one does there it, I mean, I think, you know, it should create some interest for the rest of the Tour.  
  
  Q. What about yourself this week, have you been showing signs?   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: Well, I mean, I've had a tough season, but I finished third in Paris two weeks ago, so hopefully this is the start of something good.   
  
  Q. Have you changed anything?   
 SÃREN KJELDSEN: No, I've had a lot of distractions off the course early in the year, and it's just starting to settle down a little bit. So I'm starting to focus more on the stuff I need to focus on. .
