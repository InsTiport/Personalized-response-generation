 Q. Are you happy with the round? You also finished with a bogey.  
SOREN KJELDSEN: I finished with a bogey. It was playing very tough, 18. I got it down the left side a little bit, and actually hit a 3‑iron to the green, did manage to get up and down from the bunker. It's not a great 5.  
Overall a great day. Im in red numbers after two days. It's been really tough. And I'm still in there. I'm really happy about that.  
   
 Q. How difficult is it to get a low score out there with these wind conditions?  
SOREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, it's brutal. I hit a lot of quality shots. I made one birdie today. To be fair, I had quite a few chances that I didn't take. The round really from the striking perspective and hitting the shots it wasn't that different from yesterday.   
But yesterday like when I gave myself chances, I made them. I didn't do that today. So it sort of balanced out a little bit today. But I probably played as well as I did yesterday, it's very tough.  
   
 Q. Are you looking forward to going out tomorrow in the latter groups in the afternoon and the theatre of playing in the Masters?  
SOREN KJELDSEN: Fantastic. Last time I played here I was like top 10 after two days, and I played with Couples on the Saturday, and it was a great thrill. It's still a day that I look back on, to be out with Couples on a Saturday at the Masters late in the day, it doesn't get much better than that. I've got a chance of writing a new chapter and I can't wait.
