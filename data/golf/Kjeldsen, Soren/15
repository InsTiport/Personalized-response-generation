SÃREN KJELDSEN   
 Q.  What do you reckon a 66 on day three?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: It was nice.  I felt like I played a lot better yesterday, and obviously much easier conditions this morning.  Played just about nine holes without any breeze pretty much.  Then got 3-under early and then kept playing nicely.  I was into a nice rhythm and kept hitting good shots and made a couple of putts and it was a good round.   
 Q.  Does this feel a different golf course to what it was on day one?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, because the wind is completely opposite, as well.  So all the holes that played downwind the other day, like 6, for example, made really long, par 5.  Now you can get up easily, so it was nice.  It's a great golf course and it's nice to see it with a different wind direction.   
 Q.  Appreciate the leaders haven't even come to the course yet, but what do you reckon to your position now and chances into Sunday of a decent finish?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: I don't get too caught up in that.  U.S. Open and Bridgestone, I didn't play very well.  Didn't play very well on Thursday.  Played better yesterday and then played nicely today.   
So that's really all I'm concerned about.  The graph is sort of growing up and I'm feeling more comfortable, especially on the driving.  When I start seeing a few nice drives, it seems to sort of sharpen the rest of my game.   
 Q.  All good preparation for Royal Troon?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, but you know, this is a great tournament.  Scottish Open is a fantastic event and it's one of our premiere events.  So I'm not thinking about Troon yet.  This is an important event and I want to do well this week.
