 Q.  Another good day on a tough course.  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: Yeah, funny enough, St. Andrews is for me by far the toughest course.  I always find it very, very difficult.  So I sort of know that Kingsbarns and here, I've got to score.  So it's nice to get that good start this morning.   
But I played really well.  Thought I played really well yesterday, as well, at St. Andrews and obviously had a good score on Kingsbarns.  Especially the last two days, I feel I've been striking the ball really well.   
 Q.  Any highlights or just a good, solid day all around?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: The start was very important, 3-under through four, and then a little bit of a rough patch there, and then to get it going again on 12 and 14, 15, and then I hit a fantastic -- probably the best shot I hit today was out of the bunker on 16 to save par there.   
All in all, really good.  I love this course and it's nice to play well on it.   
 Q.  Why do you think you struggle around St. Andrews?  
SÃREN KJELDSEN: I think generally, I think there are two things.  I think big hitters have a massive advantage because everybody hits a lot of fairways on St. Andrews.  The thing is, I struggle to stop the ball because I hit longer shots in.  They can bomb it and then they can spin it.  It's really more to do with spin, but because length, if you hit a long drive, you go in with a shorter club, you can spin it.  It's a spin thing, and therefore, I really have to play well along the ground, sort of those 60-, 70-, 80-yard shots, and I haven't quite done that in the past.  I'll have to keep working on that.
