Q. Overall thoughts on your day.  Obviously you hit the first tee shot of 2016 calendar year.  Pretty good round?
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: Yeah, I played pretty good.  Just didn't hole putts like I should, normally do.  I had four or five putts that were about six feet that just couldn't hole them.
But, yeah, it all went pretty good.  It was just kind of, a just first round of the year, you just can't get too up or down about it, you just kind of take it and just go from there.
Q. You made birdie despite that hook on 1?
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: Yeah, it was in the ninth fairway, so that was fun.
