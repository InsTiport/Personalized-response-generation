  SMYLIE KAUFMAN: Looking at things I can improve on. It was just a tough day.  
   
 Q. You're in the middle of your own battle, but did you feel for Jordan on No. 12?  
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: Yeah, I was really cheering for Jordan as a buddy, and it's unfortunate what happened. But it just kind of stunk to watch it, but we both kind of struggled for‑‑ we played great that front nine, but it was just kind of a weird day for both of us.  
   
 Q. Was it difficult today, was it tricky?  
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: With Jordan? Well, it looked like he just came out of it a little bit. There was a couple of swings where he just came out of it a little today, but he putted unbelievable. If he had putted for me, I would have had a great day.   
   
 Q. You had a really good iron shot on 1, right above the hole, do you think things would have been different if you made that one?  
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: It could have been a different day. But I did get up on 2 and stepped up with a pretty good putt. Making that putt on 1 would have been huge for me, but you never know what is going to happen. But it is what it is now.   
   
 Q. How will you remember this Masters?  
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: It was so cool. That last round really stunk, but just the crowd and just how loud it was, the roars. I got to watch Jordan handle the pressure and just see what it was kind of like. So I'm just going to try to build on it moving forward and I'll see what I can do in the coming years here.  
   
 Q. Considering how much youve played with Jordan, how surprising was not just No. 12, but his second shot there?  
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: Like when he dropped it? You can get some lies out here that just sit kind of funny. To me that's probably what happened. He probably went down to try to get it and just caught it a little heavy. It happens. It probably just wasn't a perfect lie and just felt like he had to go down and get it. And what happened, happened.  
   
 Q. Knowing him like you do, how do you think he'll handle this?  
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: You know, I can't speak for Jordan. I kind of just worry about what I did. Which was‑‑ which wasn't a great day for me, but I I'm going to try to build on what I can do.   
   
 Q. What do you make of Sunday at the Masters?  
SMYLIE KAUFMAN: Its cool. That was some heat. Obviously I've never felt something like that before. I think I got in my own head a little bit. I didn't do a great job with close reaction and I think I got in my own head a little bit with the putter. But everything else is awesome. I loved the atmosphere, it was cool. It's something I think I'll thrive in one day.
