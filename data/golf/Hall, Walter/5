WALTER HALL:  It is a big deal.  It is the first one I have ever played in.  I was really excited, looking forward to playing, and glad we got this first round behind me.

WALTER HALL:  I am really, really happy with a couple under par on a golf course like This.  It is in great shape and get the ball in the right place on the green, you get some birdie putts.

WALTER HALL:  (about playing conservatively).  Definitely.  You are trying to hit the fairways and obviously trying to keep it below the hole.  Both my bogeys I missed the fairway off the tee and led to a bogey.  You have to keep it in the fairway to have a play in the green just about.  So you can try to keep it below the hole because if you don't, you really got some tough putts.

WALTER HALL:  Obviously I feel like just by watching it on TV - obviously I have never played - anything around par is awfully good.  Par is going to be a good score when the dust settles after 72 holes and hopefully I can continue to play well and make a few birdies; make a few pars and make a few bogeys.
