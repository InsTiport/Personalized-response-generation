Q.   Take me through your round.   Positives?   Negatives?
MICHAEL BLOCK:   Struck it well.   Had to get used to the speed of the greens.   They were so much faster today than they were in the practice rounds.   That took me a while. 
Even on my triple, I hit a lot of good shots, believe it or not.   I felt like I got a little unlucky.   Had some tough lies and made a big number which obviously is going to cost me a lot. 
I didn't play bad outside of that.   Couple of bogeys here and there, couple little 3â€‘footers I missed.   I missed probably three putts within three feet, which is very frustrating to me. 
All in all, like I said, I hit it good.   Hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, struck it nicely.   I'll learn from it.   I can come back tomorrow and definitely put a low number in there.

Q.   Are you going to be more aggressive tomorrow?   What is the game plan for tomorrow? 
MICHAEL BLOCK:   I'll keep the same game plan.   I think I will make more putts and stick it a little more.   Two birdies for me is very many.   I think I'm going to have a lot more birdies tomorrow for sure. 
I'm going to get a lot more used to the speed of the greens.   The speed of the greens is something that I'm unfamiliar with from my club and just in general.   It's kind of a different sport out there today for me with that.   Once you lose the touch and feel for that, you also lose the touch and the feel for the breaking of the putts.   So that's all of a sudden caused me a lot of missed putts which was very frustrating.
