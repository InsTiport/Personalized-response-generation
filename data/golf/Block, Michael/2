 Q.   How was it out there with the conditions today and playing here in the second round of the PGA tournament?  
MICHAEL BLOCK:   It was great.   I had a blast.   My pairing was fantastic.   I just had three bad holes that cost me probably the cut, cost me pretty much the entire tournament.   
A triple and two doubles over those two days, other than that I played my normal golf, played solid.   Played well.   I'm happy with‑‑ not exactly happy with the results, but I'm happy with how I played.  
   
 Q.   The whole experience, even through the rain today?  
MICHAEL BLOCK:   No problem.   The experience was fantastic.   Everyone is playing in the same conditions.   I've got no problem with that.   
I definitely am not used to greens this fast or bent grass cut that low.   I was out of my element, little different than what I normally get to play on.   It was fantastic, the conditions were absolutely fantastic, just a little different from what I used to.   It took a little bit of time to get used to it for sure.  
   
 Q.   First course you ever played in Kentucky?  
MICHAEL BLOCK:   Yes, it is.   It was fantastic.   Kentucky has been great.   We have been staying downtown Louisville all week and everyone has been absolutely fantastic.   Couldn't ask for more.   It was a great experience.   
I'm going to learn a lot from this, for sure.   I can't wait to go play in my next golf tournament, to tell you the truth.
