 Q.  Who are you picking this weekend? AFC and NFC Championship games.  
MARCUS ALLEN: I don't know. Obviously, Kansas City, they've had home field advantage before, you know?   
 Q.  Yeah, I know.  
MARCUS ALLEN: And they didn't close the deal, but hopefully this year they will. The Titans are playing well.   
Then San Francisco 49ers and the Packers, that's going to be an interesting game too even though the 49ers beat them early on. I feel like they can handle them pretty well, but the Packers are a different team now.   
I've just got this sneaky suspicion it's going to be a repeat of Super Bowl I.   
 Q.  Really?  
MARCUS ALLEN: Yeah, it's just a guess. It's just the way everything is lining up.   
Did you pay attention to the National Championship Game when they came across all the numerology and stuff with the last Heisman Trophy winner candidate. Maybe it's the same thing. It will be interesting to find out.   
 Q.  What do you think the result will be? If it's Kansas City-Packers and a repeat of Super Bowl I, I mean, come on.  
MARCUS ALLEN: I'd pick -- I think the Chiefs will win this time (laughter). This is a little different.   
 Q.  Who are you picking for the NFC and AFC Championship games this weekend and then your pick for the Super Bowl?  
BRIAN URLACHER: Patrick Mahomes is the man. I'm liking the Kansas City Chiefs this Sunday, and it would be nice to see Andy Reid win the whole thing. With the home teams this weekend -- the 49ers looked awesome last week. Then I think it's the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.   
RICHARD DENT: Oh, man, I like the 49ers and Chiefs this Sunday, but I tell you what, Tennessee is playing great ball right now. They're looking really good. I think Kansas City will win, but it wouldn't surprise me if the Titans win, and if they beat the Chiefs, I think they'll win the Super Bowl. If it's the Niners and Chiefs, I think the Chiefs will win.
