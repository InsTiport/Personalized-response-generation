 Q.  What a wonderful round of golf today.  Right now you are in the clubhouse.  How was this golf course for you, do you feel really comfortable here?  
SATOSHI KODAIRA: Yes, this course is very similar to courses in Japan.  And during the practice round I felt very comfortable playing this course.  So, yes, it fit me very well.   
 Q.  You had a great start, three birdies and then a little bit of a strum Bell there at No. 16 -- No. 17, that's a very difficult hole?  
SATOSHI KODAIRA: Yes, the second shot was difficult there.  But I was able to overcome that.   
 Q.  Right now you are eligible to play next week in the Valero Texas Open in San Antonio, are you going to play?  
SATOSHI KODAIRA: Yes.   
 Q.  You have in the made that many starts on the PGA Tour.  Does today's performance give you confidence that you belong here?

 Q.  I overheard you tell television that when you got here you felt very comfortable at Harbour Town.  What made you comfortable?  
SATOSHI KODAIRA: We had a lot of birdie chances and a lot of great shots.  Why I'm comfortable here is this course is very similar to the courses in Japan, a little bit shorter and a shaped course.  I felt very comfortable in the practice rounds.   
 Q.  Have you had any conversations with Hideki Matsuyama about playing here on Tour on a regular basis?  
SATOSHI KODAIRA: I've not talked to Hideki.  But I've been watching him on TV and it gives me confidence and inspiration to play on the PGA Tour.
