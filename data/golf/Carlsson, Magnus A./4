   MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: So far I'm really enjoying this, playing good golf, perfect weather.   
  
  Q. What is the reason and why is it all coming together?   
 MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: Well, this week, I've been hitting the ball very good off the tee and good iron shots. But I think up-and-down shots have been a lot better since the beginning of the season.  
  
  Q. On a tricky course, it has to be said that Vilamoura is playing tougher than it was last year, if it weren't for the scoring.   
 MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: They say the rough is thicker this year. So you have to really hit the fairways, because if you're in the rough, you're dead.   
  
  Q. And you're making most fairways, are you?   
 MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: I don't know about that, but I've been hitting a lot of fairways.  
  
  Q. When you reflect on the last few weeks, presumably just builds confidence and you just feel that much more eager to get out on the golf course?  
 MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: You feel more relaxed if you know that you can play good golf and just go out there and hopefully hit good shots, and if you do it, you get more confidence.   
  
  Q. But do you change expectations, as well?   
 MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: No. I haven't been thinking about that. Just been playing and having good scores. Just play golf and see where the score is.   
  
  Q. I take it this is a good place, a good part of the world to play golf at this time of year?  
 MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: It is fantastic. Today is not as hot as yesterday but it's really good. Wish we had more tournaments this time of the year down here.  
  
  Q. Tell me about the man on your bag. Who is your caddie?  
 MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: A friend of mine. He's a good player, as well, and plays on the Swedish Tour. I've known him for quite a while and he knows what golf is about. We have fun on the course. It's good.   
  
  Q. I take it that helps, having a close friend on the bag?  
 MAGNUS A. CARLSSON: Yeah, I think the important thing is to enjoy yourself on the course. If you don't do that, you can't play good golf.
