  MAGNUS CARLSSON:   It's a good start.   Game felt pretty solid today.   Put some nice practice last couple of weeks, and shots were going the right way today.   Putts were dropping, as well, so that was a good start.   
   
 Q.   I guess nobody can complain in this kind of weather, but a course you enjoy, is it?   
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   Yeah, it's a nice course.   I didn't think we were going to play this close very well ‑‑ to Ireland to the coast, but coming here, it's a beautiful course and great condition and perfect weather, as well.  
   
 Q.   With all the links courses in Ireland and being by the course, you would have expected something a lot faster and without the lush greens we have here.   
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   Yes, I guess we'll be playing one at The Scottish Open.   I heard that that one is a really linksy course, but I like this one, as well.  
   
 Q.   Is this a strategic course, one that you have to plot your way around a little bit?   
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   I think so.   I think like always, it's important to hit the fairways, so you can control your approach shots.   Of course, it's good if you hit it long, but you have to hit it straight, as well, so I think it's more strategic than just bombing it.  
   
 Q.   I know we didn't see you at your very best at the Nordea Masters, but you said you had been working hard in that interim sorting out a few things.   
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   Yeah, exactly, sorting out my head.   I wasn't quite there.   I was hitting good shots, but once a bad one came, just ruined the day.  
   
 Q.   I know we have said this so many times, but it is a silly game, isn't it, one that's so much in your head; you know your ability.   
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   Yeah, just got to keep working hard.
