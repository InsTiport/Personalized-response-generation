Q.   Your thoughts on the day? 
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   I'm happy, good things this week.   I played solid from tee‑to‑green, and I made some nice up‑and‑downs, as well.   My putter worked well, so I'm happy with it.

Q.   From day one you were there and you knew there was a victory chance coming into the final day. 
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   Yeah, and I knew if I kept playing the way I've been playing, and making some putts, I would be up there, so I'm happy.

Q.   What was the story with the final day, because again, you were there, but didn't quite knock on. 
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   Well, I think the back nine, I didn't hit it as close on the front nine and I didn't hit the putts as good as I did on the front nine, as well, so nothing really happened.   Kind of chickened out on the lastand didn't chip it.   I should have chipped it.   

Q.   I know consistency isn't a sexy word but it's what everybody is striving for out here, isn't it. 
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   I think so.   I think a lot of the weeks, it's about making the fewest mistakes and taking the chances when you get them. 

Q.   There are plenty of busy periods on The European Tour but am I right to presume this is a nice busy period for you? 
MAGNUS CARLSSON:   Yes, and I think everyone is going to play all of them and it's a nice busy stretch.
