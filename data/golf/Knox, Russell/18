Q. Give us some overall thoughts on the round?
RUSSELL KNOX: It was great.  I think I was just plodding away and playing okay.  And made kind of a mess of the 12th hole from the middle of the fairway.
I made a great par on 14.  I holed a wedge.  And hit a 6-iron on 16 to two feet.
The round was just good in four holes.  So it was nice.  I haven't had one of those bang-bang runs in a while.
And then on 18 I laid up -- actually holed a nice putt.  It was one of those rounds where I was just playing okay and all of a sudden got a little spark and was able to get it in.
