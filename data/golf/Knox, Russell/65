Q. It took two days to complete, but Russell in with a bogey-free 67 here in the second round.  How would you characterize the performance over the past two days for you?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I played great.  I think one bogey and that was on 16 with a 5-iron in my hand, so I played excellent tee to green and I holed the putts I needed to hole, haven't made any long ones yet, so I can't wait for the weekend.
Q. What the conditions that you saw here early on Saturday morning with respect to the past two days?
RUSSELL KNOX: The wind has switched, a different direction this morning.  I was I was in 16 fairway and the wind was into me last night and it was down this morning, so, but no, the conditions are perfect, the greens are super fast now and they're firming up nicely and it's going to be a real challenge.
Q. 9-under par through two rounds here at THE PLAYERS, a great position to be in.  But a lot of work to do to catch Jason at the top.  How do you balance getting aggressive and realizing that this golf course can bite you?
RUSSELL KNOX: I mean, I, you just got to play your own game.  I don't care what Jason does, to be honest.  I mean, it's, I mean, he could go on and win by 15 shots or he could back up.  So it's just one of those courses, you just got to stay on your game and see where you finish.
Q. A local boy here, you went to school not far from here, what does it mean to play so well in this part of the northern part of Florida?
RUSSELL KNOX: No, it's greats of the.  I have so many fans from Jacksonville University where I went to school here and friends and family from around town, so the support has been incredible and I hope I give them something to cheer for on Sunday.
