 Q.  How challenging were the conditions today?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, really, really tough.  Especially as we made the turn there on the hardest holes on the course.  I mean, the rain was pounding and it was decently windy, so it was challenging.  But at least it wasn't cold.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, pretty good.  Shot under par on a day where it was pouring rain around an Open Championship course.  I'm quite pleased.   
 Q.  Were you surprised?  It was good conditions and then bad conditions.  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I played well yesterday.  I hit a lot of good shots, and the bad ones I hit I got severely punished for.  Today it wasn't really that case.  So it was nice to maybe get a couple good breaks.   
But I played lovely today.  I hit the ball where I was looking and putted well.   
 Q.  You must be optimistic that you'll make the cut?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, there's no worries.  That's safely in.   
 Q.  Good luck on the weekend.  
RUSSELL KNOX: Thank you very much.
