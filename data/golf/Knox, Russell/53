RUSSELL KNOX: I played well today.  Bogey at the first, and 17 and other than that, I played very nicely.   
 Q.  You spoke to us yesterday that you were disappointed; is it a case of what could have been this week?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I think so.  I battled as hard as I could.  I putted really well today.  This was really the only really good putting round I had.  So normally it takes two or three really good ones to be right up there.  But no, all in all, I mean, great to finish with a birdie at the last.   
My bogey I made on 17, I holed a great putt.  That was good, too.   
 Q.  And now travelling to Troon, what sort of mind-set are you in ahead of The Open?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, great.  Especially kind of the way I felt today and the way I drove the ball, the way I putted.  No, today was a great day to kind of build my confidence going into next week, so I look forward to it very much.
