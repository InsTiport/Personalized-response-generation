Q. Good round yesterday following an opening 73, 68 today.  What changed day two?
RUSSELL KNOX: I drove the ball nice.  It was probably my best driving day I've had in a long time, and then I was able to kind of attack from there.  I made a few putts.  It was nice, bogey-free today.
I haven't went bogey-free in a long time, so I was thinking about that coming down the last few holes, so I was glad I was able to go mistake-free.
Q. 14th Race to Dubai heading in.  How much do your objectives changes moving up the leaderboard today, given a big week, a lot at stake, bonus pool and obviously trying to finish The European Tour season on a high?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, obviously the Top-10 bonus pool was my huge goal coming into the week.  Yesterday was a very important round.  I played awful and managed to shoot 1-over with a few really good par saves coming in.
So I knew that that round could be important as it goes on and obviously after a good round today puts me in much better shape for the weekend.  See what happens.
