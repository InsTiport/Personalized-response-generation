 Q.   Just talk about all the starting and stopping and what's the hardest part of all of it?  
RUSSELL KNOX:   I just started my warm up.   I think I hit three or four balls before the horn blew.   It's not ideal.   We all wish we were going out there to play.   But that was some of the craziest weather I think I've ever seen, for a long time, too.   For a good hour and a half, it was just torrential rain and blowing 50.   Terrible.   
   
 Q.   You probably would have enjoyed being out there in that right, the wind?   
RUSSELL KNOX:   Absolutely‑‑ that was too severe.   Obviously with the lightning, and the whole course is underwater.   That was‑‑ hopefully they are going to be able to get the course playable for tomorrow, because that's as bad as I've ever seen it rainy think.  
   
 Q.   What's the toughest part of all this starting and stopping?   
RUSSELL KNOX:   It's fine for me because I had not even really started doing anything.   I think it would be tougher for the guys who played a couple holes, because if you're just right on the tee maybe, but for me because I really isn't can't start, it wasn't too bad but yeah, because I'm in good position, I want to play and just having to wait around is never easy.   
   
 Q.   Tonight, you have a few extra hours, what will you do tonight?   
RUSSELL KNOX:   Same thing.   My wife's family is here so hang out with them and that will take my mind off it all.
