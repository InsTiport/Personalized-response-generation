 Q.  Early in the FedExCup, obviously playing pretty well, do you feel like you're getting some early-season momentum?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, absolutely.  Finishing the year like I did, really contending a few times in Malaysia, China, MÃ©xico, that was really nice.  Especially after coming off my best season ever.   
Yeah, it's nice.  I got to play last week, and I did okay.  And then coming here and playing good for the few rounds, yeah, I felt some momentum before I'm going to take a little break.   
 Q.  When you come out on the golf course and there's a big lead there at the top, what goes through your mind?  What's your strategy going into the day?  
RUSSELL KNOX: You've just got to play and hope that he stops making birdies.  Because if he continues to make birdies, then it's so hard to catch up.  I mean, he's playing incredible golf.  But no, you've just got to go out and shoot your best score, and if it's not good enough to win, then hopefully you're second.
