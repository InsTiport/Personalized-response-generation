 Q.   A few short but another nice week here at PGA National for you.   Talk about your final round?  
RUSSELL KNOX:   I played good today.   I start off, sloppy 3‑putt on No.9.   That kind of stalled things.   But I hit the ball great on the back nine.   I 3‑putted again on No. 16, but I made two great putts on 17 and 18.   So that makes me leave with a good taste in my mouth.  
   
 Q.   What can a week like this do for your confidence going forward this year?   
RUSSELL KNOX:   Well, I've had a few of them so far.   It's been‑‑ my confidence is high.   Just need to keep doing what I'm doing and maybe one of these days.
