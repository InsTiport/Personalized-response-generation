 Q.  6-under around Carnoustie, you must be happy with the day?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I mean, to have no bogey, I was delighted. Didn't probably feel quite as good as yesterday, but managed to take care of the holes I needed to take care of. Played the par 5s well, and all in all, obviously thrilled with the day.   
 Q.  Looking ahead, as well, to the weekend, it's a nice position. How do you approach then going to another new course and coming back as well to St. Andrews as the end?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, today was obviously a day, the harder of the courses, Carnoustie. Shooting 6-under was definitely a bonus. I knew anything kind of under par would be good. But yeah, got it going, and it will be nice to go out to Kingsbarns tomorrow and hammer down there and see how low you can go. The scores are obviously very good. It's kind of fun to play three great courses where you can shoot good scores on.   
So just got to go out and continue to be super-aggressive and see where I finish.   
 Q.  How have you found the week, a bit more relaxed with the Pro-Am element side of things?  
RUSSELL KNOX: It's been great. I've thoroughly enjoyed staying in St. Andrews with my wife. We've been able to walk around and eat dinner. It's super relaxing, enjoyable week and everybody that I spoke to from the European Tour said the same thing. It has come true. It's a very enjoyable tournament, and I definitely will come back.
