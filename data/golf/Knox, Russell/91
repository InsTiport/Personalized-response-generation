 Q.  That bogey-free 4-under 67 is one of the better efforts this afternoon.  Your thoughts on the round?  RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I'm thrilled.  Anytime you can have no bogeys on a PGA Tour course, you play nicely.  I drove it well.  My iron play was good and I made a couple nice putts.   Q.  Talk about the PGA Tour setup.  Talk about the conditions out there this afternoon.  RUSSELL KNOX: There wasn't much wind, so it was slightly easier.  The greens are very firm and fast.  So you have to have good numbers to be able to hit it close to have the right shot shape.  You have to make sure you get it in the fairway to have some spin to get it close.  It's just judging the first bounce on the greens, and I was able to do that.   Q.  I'm interested in your opinion, obviously we're in the playoffs, and we're getting into the depths of the playoffs, is it business as usual or is it a change in strategy?  RUSSELL KNOX: I've got nothing to lose this week.  I think I should be fine to get into next week's BMW.  But in order to make it to The TOUR Championship I have to play some stellar golf.  You can just free up and go for it and hopefully that's what I'll do the next few days.
