 Q.  Russell, nice way to finish a round there.  How would you assess your play out there?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Today was the best round I've played in a long time.  Yesterday I struggled to get comfortable on pretty much every shot I hit, but today I felt much better.  I hope I feel like that tomorrow because felt good swinging it.  Made a lot of nice putts, and really enjoyed my day out there.   
 Q.  Was there something that changed kind of overnight with your feeling and your comfort level with what you're doing?  
RUSSELL KNOX: I just -- I scored very nicely yesterday but just was kind of nervy.  No, nothing changed.   
I just woke up, and I was like why am I nervous?  I mean, I shot 64.  I'm playing good.  I just tried to stay as free as I could today.  I was obviously thrilled with how I played.   
 Q.  A little bit of a strange morning this morning here in Hawaii.  First off, did you get the alert on your phone?  And if you did, what was your first reaction?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, my wife was out walking, and she called me straight away.  My first reaction was it made my heart start beating a little bit faster.  I went out to the balcony of the hotel.  I don't know what I was expecting to see, like a missile flying into Waikiki.  I don't know.  It was a horrible message to get, obviously.  I'm certainly glad it was a mistake.   
 Q.  Have you ever experienced any fear like that or thoughts like that in your lifetime?  
RUSSELL KNOX: It felt, obviously, fake.  I mean, it doesn't happen very often.  It's not ever happened to me, that's for sure.  It was very bizarre, but, obviously, we're all very lucky that it turned out to be a wrong push of the button.
