Q. (Inaudible).
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I played excellent today.  I hit a lot of good shots.  I still didn't hole very much.  But the screens are very difficult to hole putts on a lot of little subtle wobbles at the end.  No, I was thrilled with that.  I was really happy to finish with a good score.
Q. (Inaudible).
RUSSELL KNOX: I had two goals today:  One was to par the second, and one was to hit the 11th fairway, and I checked both boxes, and I said after I hit the 11th fairway, I would bogey in and be happy.
Yeah, no, I played number 2 better, and I hit a phenomenal drive on 11, so that was good.
Q. How would you assess the week?
RUSSELL KNOX: Good, yeah.  I probably finished where I deserved to finish.  I think I would like to say I played better than I did, but probably didn't.  So I think wherever I finish is pretty fair.
Q. (Inaudible).
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, absolutely.  I'm hitting the ball good.  I feel like I'm improving every week.  Short game's good, putting is good, ball just didn't want to go in.  So I'm delighted.
Q. PGA next?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yes, yes.  Go home for a week and go try again.
Q. What made you go there?
RUSSELL KNOX: I played one practise round here, so that worked out, not that bad.  So I'll probably do the same thing there.
Q. (Inaudible).
RUSSELL KNOX: FedExCup is now my goal.  Obviously the Ryder Cup is very important to me, but I'm trying not to think about it, to be honest.  I had great position in the FedExCup.  I would love to stay where I am or move up.  I've never made it to East Lake.  Obviously I've got a pretty good chance to do it now, so that's my main goal now.
Q. (Inaudible).
RUSSELL KNOX: Never, never, if it's like this (laughing).  No, as of right now, no.  But we'll wait and see.
Q. (Inaudible).
RUSSELL KNOX: I think he gave up on me (laughing).  No, I bumped into him yesterday, but we haven't spoken about anything since the rookie potential player meeting at THE PLAYERS, which I think is great.  I don't need him to give me a pep talk or tell me anything.  It's up to me.  I need to crack the whip and play good, and if I don't, I don't deserve to make it.
