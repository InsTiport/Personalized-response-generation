 Q.  First of all, congratulations.  How does it feel, first tournament win on the PGA TOUR, European Tour on the world stage, WGC event and the HSBC, how does that sound to you?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Sounds unbelievable.  I always kind of thought I was going to win a big one for some reason as my first one.  I've been close a few times before.  But this is going to take a long time to sink in.   
 Q.  Historically, this has been a bomber's course, but this week, you wedged them to death, and you just stuck to your game plan.  How did you sort of keep that out; you have guys bombing it so far out and you just stuck to your game?  
RUSSELL KNOX: My iron play this week was incredible.  I knew with lift, clean and place, I could give myself a perfect lie, and didn't matter if I hit 5-iron or lob-wedge.  I felt comfortable and I was going to give myself a birdie chance.  My iron play was the key today.   
 Q.  Being a Scotsman from Inverness, this pride of Scotland; how was it moving from Scotland to the PGA TOUR and bypassing The European Tour?  
RUSSELL KNOX: It was kind of a natural thing for me.  My father is from the United States.  A lot of my family still live there.  So we had spent a lot of time there growing up.  So it wasn't that big a transition, really, for me, and I feel comfortable there.  I love Scotland.
