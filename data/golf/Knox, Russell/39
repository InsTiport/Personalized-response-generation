RUSSELL KNOX: I didn't feel quite as great with the putter today as the first two days, but room for improvement tomorrow.
Q. A couple of moments that could have been tricky.
RUSSELL KNOX: After hitting it in the water on 14, to make a massive putt for par was huge.  And then of course I birdied the next, which is a massive momentum change there.
Those little moments are what adds up in a tournament, so I was very happy that I was able to get through those holes in 1-under.  Could have been a lot worse.
Q. Those moments presumably give you the kind of lift to say you're still involved, still chasing and you've still got a very realistic chance.
RUSSELL KNOX: Absolutely.  The way Hideki played today, he's probably going to play similar tomorrow.  I'm going to have to be foot down, be aggressive and try and catch him.
Q. Can you give an appreciation of how well Hideki's playing?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, he's playing very well.  He drove the ball in play a lot.  He's an extremely aggressive iron player, and when he's on, he's as good as anyone.
Q. You fancy chasing him down, though; of course you do.
RUSSELL KNOX: I'm not going to give up my title without a big fight tomorrow.  I look forward to every minute tomorrow and see what happens.
Q. I imagine if we gave you a position in the last group on the first day, you'd have taken it, wouldn't you?
RUSSELL KNOX: Absolutely.  I'm thrilled to be in this position.
Q. What will it take?
RUSSELL KNOX: Probably close to the round of my life I think.  Going to have to play excellent golf, be patient, hole some putts.  It's going to be difficult but can't wait for it.
Q. What has been the round of your life so far?  Here last year?
RUSSELL KNOX: I've had a few.  59 was probably the best round I've ever had.  But I'll take mid 60s tomorrow and run.
