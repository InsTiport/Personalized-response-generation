 Q.  Bogey on the opening hole and then some pretty solid golf.  
RUSSELL KNOX: I have not figured out the first hole here at Ballyliffin yet.  I hit it in the same bunker three days in a row.  Hopefully tomorrow I'll get it.  But then I settled down and got through a couple holes when it was raining, kind of nasty out, and played good golf for three quarters of the round.  It was very good.   
 Q.  Tell us about the eagle?  
RUSSELL KNOX: First time I hit that fairway, beautiful drive and I had a perfect 4-hybrid for me and was able to Ping it up the hill and came out perfect and got to 15, 18, 20 feet, somewhere in there.  That was a bonus for sure.   
 Q.  How has the rain changed the dynamic out there?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, we got the full Irish experience today.  It was cold at times.  It was windy.  It was very calm.  It got hot for a while.  It was everything.  It was a little softer.  The greens are a little slower and I actually fixed a pitchmark on the last hole, first one all week.   
The course is playing beautiful.  You get rewarded for hitting the fairway and hitting good iron shots.   
 Q.  Leaders at 14-under at the moment, six shots clear of you.  In golf, nothing is impossible.  Is that the attitude you take into Sunday?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, he might be six ahead but only two or three people ahead of me so numbers-wise, it's not that big a deal.  If the guy that's leading keeps going, hats off, that's unbelievable, but Sunday is always much harder.
