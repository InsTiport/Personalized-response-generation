Q. What's your verdict on the week?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I mean, today was a bummer.  Just didn't get off to, I got off to an okay start.  I was 1-under  and I was kind of in between clubs and I wasn't able to make birdies and the other guys were, and I just kind of started to force it.
Made a mistake and a bad swing, and before you know it, I made four bogeys in a row and I just completely had lost it.  It was tough to pull myself back.  It was a shame, I battled hard, but it just wasn't meant to be.
Q. Is it one of those that you will go away and when you've got the quiet time to reflect, you'll have done a good job.
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I think I finished tied ninth.  Of course that's never bad.  But I definitely didn't play well enough to win today, so hats off to Hideki.  He was brilliant.  I mean, I should have done better than I did.
Q. Elaborate on Hideki, if you wouldn't mind, because you've seen him at close quarters and he's won by a country mile.
RUSSELL KNOX: No weaknesses the last two days.  He drove the ball well and far, and his iron play was very good.  And he made it look very easy to be honest.
Q. From your perspective on the PGA TOUR, this is kind of a nice start to the year in terms of ranking points and all of that?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, absolutely.  That was one of my goals this year was to have more Top-10s, so two out of two so far, so that's always nice.
I came to Malaysia and China here, I was in the last group on Sunday in both tournaments, so I'm proud of myself for that.  Just a little disappointed; I played horrendous on Sunday both times.
Q. Plan from here on?
RUSSELL KNOX: Go home.  Take a week off and give my trophy to Hideki.
