Q. Thoughts after that round?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, 2-under, finishing with birdie is of course nice.  But I mean, I threw away a couple there when I certainly didn't need to.  But I played better than 2-under, which is disappointing not to turn that into a score.  But I mean, it was nice to finish with a birdie in the rain.
Q. Fair to say that conditions have been very testing?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I mean, it was very easy at times, though.  We had everything today.  It wasn't windy but it was quite warm for a while and then obviously now it's humping down rain.  Yeah, it's a good test.
Q. Can you sum up what happened 16, 17, what went wrong?
RUSSELL KNOX: I just made a terrible club selection.
