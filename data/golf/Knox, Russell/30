Q. Well, Russ, nice comeback today.  6-under round after yesterday's 73.  I watched you both days; what was the difference?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I mean, yesterday I had no birthday birdies yesterday.  I don't know.  I mean, I played one terrible hole on the par-5, and then the drivable hole there 15, hit it in the water.  So I played -- and I three-putt the other par-5.  So I played the three easiest holes at 3-over yesterday and today I got them.
But today was good.  I had a good feeling about today, if I just kept playing the same way I have been, I'd make some birdies, and I did.
Q. You were shut out for birdies on your birthday, which is a terrible thing, but you came on strong today.  Was the course condition any different?  I know it was cooler this morning when you teed off.
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I mean, it was a perfect day.  There was a little breeze to keep you honest, but this course is always easier in the morning.  It crisps up a little bit in the afternoon.  But, yeah today was good.  I struck the ball nice, and of course I holed some putts too, which I holed a couple of big par putts there just after making the turn that kept things going and made a couple nice birdies.  So I'm happy with that.
Q. Let me ask you this:  Last year the winning score to get in the playoff was 12-under.  You've won here before.  Do you feel pretty good now that you've turned things around heading into the weekend?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I mean, to be honest, this course you're only one good round away from being in the mix.  It gets tough here on the weekend.  I know there's going to be a little weather tomorrow possibly, but, hey, I'm going to need to throw up another 64 or so.  But I've done it before here, like you said, so there's always a chance.
