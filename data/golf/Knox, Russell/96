  RUSSELL KNOX:   I hit some really good shots which I was able to compromise.   I was all over the place.   Funny how it works.   Haven't been driving fine in a long time.   I just was able to recover.   That was nice.   But I made a couple nice putts early and kind of keep me in it.   I just made a lot of pars.  
   
 Q.   Was there one shot or one long putt during the round that you can point to?  
RUSSELL KNOX:   Nice par put on the par 3 13th.   I mean that was only my fourth hole but I think that was an important putt just to keep me at even par and it was missable.   So it was nice just to make that.   But, you know, I just -- I got to get in it play off the tee here if I want to do better.  
   
 Q.   Do you think any of it comes from having, you know, the good finish at Honda, now you get a little confidence and it carried over or just a grinding round that you got through?  
RUSSELL KNOX:   Yeah, just had to grind it out.   Just being cold this morning and having more clothes on than you're used to last month, I just wasn't quite in rhythm at the start of the round.   I had to kind of go through it.   I hit some great iron shots.   Irons seemed good today.
