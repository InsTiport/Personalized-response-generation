Q. How would you assess your round today?
RUSSELL KNOX:   Yeah, I played a great round today.  Hit a lot of really good shots, I felt extremely comfortable and just -- I mean, I'm not going to say I putted poorly because I didn't, I just left myself a lot of difficult putts.  And it's hard out here when you're just kind of tapping it and it's breaking a foot in the wind and bounciness of the greens.  I'm very happy with my round.
Q. How difficult were those conditions as you kind of made the turn for home like 12 and on?
RUSSELL KNOX:   Not really that hard, to be honest.  We have all played in wind before, it was nowhere near like the forecast how difficult it was.  I mean, to be honest, like normally after the rain it was harder than playing in the wind, so.
I think we kind of got a little lucky.  Yes, it was tricky, the ball wasn't going anywhere, but I mean we're all experienced enough to just hit more club when it's cold.  But it was challenging, don't get me wrong.
Q. What's the biggest key for you heading into tomorrow to go try to pick up another win?
RUSSELL KNOX:   If I keep swinging the way I'm swinging, which I hope I can, I hope I don't wake up tomorrow and get worse, I mean the person that wins tomorrow is just going to make some putts.  Get off to a fast start.  Obviously the first seven you can get, so it would be nice to get off to a flying start and then kind of hold on for the remainder.
