Q. Four birdies, four bogeys, a round of level par.  What's your assessment?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I think I scored what I should have scored.  Made a few mistakes, 3-putted from nowhere a couple times but I had some nice holes, too.  The course is tricky, though.  You get it off-line, you're kind of hacking out and it's a good test.
Q. How much of an impact is the wind on that, as well?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, we played most of our round with just a little breeze and the last five or six holes, I would say it picked up.  It's tough, though.  This course is tight.  You have to golf your ball off the tee or else it gets very difficult.
Q. Obviously you've got a busy run now, playing all the way through to The Open and hopefully going to qualify for that as you go along, as well.  With the opportunity in these Rolex Series Events, is there a sensation there's still a great opportunity with The Ryder Cup, as well, if you play well in this run?
RUSSELL KNOX: Absolutely.  Any European player is right there with a stretch of form.  You win one of these big ones and then contend again, I mean, you're right there.
I mean, I've had a decent run of form recently, so if I was to, I'm going to have to win, obviously, as I should, but that's the plan.  That's why I'm here.
Q. Off the back of a 12th place at the U.S. Open, when you play well in a major championship, how much more does that do for your confidence than in a regular event?
RUSSELL KNOX: It does, yeah.  I had had a run of missed cuts in majors, so it was nice to play four days there.  I mean, Shinnecock set up well for me; I knew it did, I was happy to finish -- disappointed not to have a Top-10 but happy with my performance and looking to see if I can snowball things.
