 Q.  Thoughts on shooting a 68 in Scottish weather?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, thrilled.  Conditions were extremely difficult.  I played well.  I had a couple chances there at the end, which I would have loved to have made, but it was hard out there.  Every shot was very difficult towards the end there when it started raining.  Thrilled with 4-under.   
 Q.  All sorts to deal with with the gusty winds.  You never know quite what to expect?  
RUSSELL KNOX: It was tough out there today.  It was hard to get where the wind was.  It felt like every hole it was completely different.  That's what makes this course so fun to play.   
It was very challenging.  And then it started to kind of mist and rain; it got very long.  The course played long.   
 Q.  You looked weary at times today, as if you're thinking, oh, I want to get out of this cold?  
RUSSELL KNOX: I was a little cold but I'm built for this.  Man, this is -- as much as I would say I don't enjoy playing in this, I'm good at it.  So I hope it's like this on the weekend.   
 Q.  Do you kind of tell yourself when you're out there and having to endure it?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Absolutely.  You have to try and find your edge.  So if you have a good attitude when the weather gets bad like that, you can maybe pick up half a shot mentally.   
 Q.  But your attitude has been spot on all week, so now when you look at that leaderboard and think into the weekend, it's good, isn't it?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Absolutely.  I was in the last group last week in Malaysia on Saturday, so same position this week.  So looking forward to doing a little better.
