 Q.  Thoughts on the round for today?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I shot 4-under, I didn't feel that great over the ball today.  So it was a bit of a struggle.  But I putted nicely and other than 1 bad swing, 4-under is pretty good.   
 Q.  Considering the heat out here, it's a bit of a patience game out here, isn't it?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Exactly, maybe that was my problem today, just my body just didn't feel as good as yesterday.  So yeah, it is, you've just got to keep going, keep drinking a lot of water and try to eat a little bit.  I probably didn't eat enough on the course, and just the last few holes, just didn't quite have the energy.  But it's okay.  I battled hard and 4-under is still pretty good.   
 Q.  Four shots back, considering how the course is set up and how you've been playing, do you think you're now too far back?  
RUSSELL KNOX: No.  This is a course where you've got to play great on the last day to win because there's going to be people that do it.  So I need to be super aggressive tomorrow and play a little bit more free than I did today.
