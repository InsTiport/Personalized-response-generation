Q.   Talk about your round and how you got it going today. 
RUSSELL KNOX:   Played very well all day.   I mean, I hit ball where I was looking, which was nice.   The first few days I just wasn't sure about my swing.   First day it was rainy and cold, especially coming from last week being so warm.
Today for whatever reason I felt right on the money.   I was just swinging freer and hitting the lines and that.   I've felt great on the greens all week.   I've hit a lot of good putts I've just missed, and a few went in today. 
No, I was very, very pleased.   Close to as good as I golf. 

Q.   You know where you are on the Money List.   Do you come into the Fall Series with a little more freer attitude?
RUSSELL KNOX:   I look at it this way:   I've not done as well as I would have liked, but the odds of playing better as the year went on have increased because I struggled at the start. 
So I knew that I wasn't going to play awful all year.   I mean, every week you get that little bit more comfortable with everything, my clubs and my swing, and I feel ready to go. 

Q.   You touched on this a little bit before.   The course, a lot different weather conditions today than the first two.   Did it play significantly different for you?
RUSSELL KNOX:   Yeah, I mean, this is the most perfect weather day in the history of golf.   I mean, a little colder in the morning and then as the day goes on, I mean, this is perfect.   Hardly any wind, 75. 
No, today was definitely a day where you could be aggressive.   The greens are pretty soft.   No, this is as good as you can hope for.
