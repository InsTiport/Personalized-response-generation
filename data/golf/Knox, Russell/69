Q. 1.5 points, so it looks like you've got the most points in your group?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, absolutely.  So I guess I control everything, if I win.  I control the group.
Q. You are in control of the group.
RUSSELL KNOX: Tomorrow is going to be a brutal day.  Branden is the high seed in our group.  So he's on paper the best player, so it's going to be a tough match.  I'm going to -- whoever makes it through any group, they have to earn it.  I'm going to have to play probably better than I did today.  Hopefully I can do that.
Q. Any course you would compare this to?
RUSSELL KNOX: There's a lot of little cool holes like at Cherry Hills.  A lot of somewhat drive-able holes.  Doesn't mean they're easy.  They are very difficult actually.
The drive-able hole on the back nine there today, No. 13, was probably one of the hardest holes on the course.  I made a mess of it.  It's a great little hole.  It's a hard course, especially with the wind switch today.  It was pumping out there at times.
Q. Branden is the highest seed, but you're a guy that's won a World Golf Championship before.  What is it like when you win one of these events?
RUSSELL KNOX: Winning is an amazing feeling.  It makes up for all the times you mess up.  I look forward to the challenge.  Obviously we are a long way away from winning.  It was a great result today.
