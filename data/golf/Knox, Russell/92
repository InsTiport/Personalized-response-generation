Q.   Talk about the day?
RUSSELL KNOX:   The front nine I played excellent.   It was as good a nine holes as I've played all year really.   I kept it in play, good iron shots, made some great putts and the back nine I didn't play as good but hung in there and made some nice up‑and‑downs.   The last three holes made up‑and‑down from the sand every hole.   So just came down to, I drove it nicely and putted excellent.   So it's easy game if you do that. 

Q.   What happened in the time frame coming in? 
RUSSELL KNOX:   I took three or four days off.   It rained a lot in Jacksonville, so it was easy to sit on the couch.   And then I worked hard.   I hit some horrific wedge shots at Valhalla so I worked hard on my wedge game and today it paid off.   I hit some nice ones.
