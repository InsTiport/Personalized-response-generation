Q. Tidy?
RUSSELL KNOX: I'm always thrilled with no bogeys, and my first round, never my strongest round.  So to get off to a flyer and shoot 6-under, delighted.
Q. And as defending champion to get off to a flyer, all the nicer, isn't it?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, absolutely.  I didn't put any pressure on myself.  I didn't feel overly tight out there, so I was proud of myself to kind of relax and enjoy it.  Can only be your first defence once, and so make sure I'm going to have a good time the next three days.
Q. Did you feel the benefit of playing in a group where you've seen Rickie Fowler move to seven and Paul Casey challenging, as well.
RUSSELL KNOX: We had an amazing time today.  It's always nice to see good shots and putts go in, and it helps your mental side of it.  So we kind of fed off each other and it was a very strong group.
Q. Sheshan is markedly different to last year.  So how did it play?  Presumably long, and very wet and damp.
RUSSELL KNOX: Conditions were just like this on Sunday last year.  It was a little cooler last year on Sunday but very dark and dreich, as the Scots would say; a little mist and rain.  But the course played awfully long, which is fine for me.  If it's lift, clean and place, as long as I'm in the fairway, I can compete around here.  So it's all about my tee shot to set up my iron game.
Q. And you were on the fairways more often than not?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, stayed out of the rough.  The rough is extremely thick this year, so you've got to be in play on the tee.
Q. Has it been any different for you so far in terms of recognition around here?
RUSSELL KNOX: When you're playing with Rickie Fowler, nobody cares if I'm defending champion.  So that always takes a little pressure off, but no, of course, some people have, and it's an honor to be the defending champion.  Hopefully I can keep my trophy.
