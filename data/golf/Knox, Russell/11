 Q.  Give us your initial thoughts on your round today.  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, it was a full grind today.  I didn't feel like I played amazing.  I scored probably as good as I should have.  I probably didn't deserve 3-under.  But I holed out nice.  My short game was good and when I did get off line I got it back in play and recovered.  Pretty thrilled with 3-under.   
 Q.  On the second, you got a particularly bad spot plugged in the bunker?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, I'll remember that for a long time.  It wasn't a good tee shot but ultimately it worked.  Hacked it out and hit a really good next shot with one of my hybrids and made a nice putt.   
So that was definitely an early turning point in the round because I could have got 1- or 2-over early and was able to save that and made up for a nice string of pars after that, and finally made some birdies.   
 Q.  5-under is leading at the moment.  Can you see that being bettered?  
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, the weather is unbelievable.  I think there's a 6-, 7- , 8-under par round out there if somebody plays very well.
