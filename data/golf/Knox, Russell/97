Q.   You get in with par at the last, let's talk about the par save which puts you at this moment in at 8‑under par tied with Ryan Palmer. 
RUSSELL KNOX:   Yeah, I mean, my caddie always talks about sometimes it doesn't need to be pretty and that's just golf.   That's the way I hacked it up that hole but only takes one good shot to make a par and thankfully I made the putt, so I'm very pleased.

Q.   What happened on 14 with the ball in the water? 
RUSSELL KNOX:   I got a horrible break off the tee.   Just rolled in the pine straw.   I thought I could get 8‑iron over the lip‑‑ it was just a really bizarre lie and I went for it and obviously it was horrible. But I was priding myself the way I got over that and finished pretty strong.

Q.   You had given yourself a chance, and now we all watch and wait. 
RUSSELL KNOX:   Thank you.
