Q. Was that a grind?  You look like you're tired.
RUSSELL KNOX: This is hard.  Bill Haas is an unbelievable player.  I had to play good to beat him.  I was really happy the way I played today.  I haven't been playing as well I would like recently.  I came out today and drove the ball beautifully.  I was really happy with the way I played.
Q. I always think one of strengths of your game you make very few mistakes?
RUSSELL KNOX: Yeah, that was my plan today, just get in the fairway, get on the green.  Make him beat me.  I did that well.  I made a lot of pars today.
Q. How important is it to get ahead in a match like you did today on a venue like this?
RUSSELL KNOX: It's crucial to get off to a good start and gain some momentum and see if you can keep it going.  If you get down in a match, it's tough to get back especially if your partner keeps hitting it down the middle.
Q. I made a comment a minute ago that I thought your game matched up well for Austin Country Club.  Is that right?
RUSSELL KNOX: I love this place.  The front nine and the back nine are completely different.  But you got to be in the fairway.  That's one of my biggest strengths is getting in play and then my iron play can take over.  I like this place.
