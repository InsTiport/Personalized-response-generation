KIRK TRIPLETT:  Well, I just played a nice steady round, had a little trouble at the start but recovered okay and made two birdies at the end, 15 and 16.  I feel like I'm right in the hunt.
Q.  How is the course playing in your opinion?
KIRK TRIPLETT:  I think it's playing like we expected it to play this week.  The greens are still reasonably receptive.  If you hit some good shots, you can still make some birdies.  It's not a torture chamber out there right now, but if you hit marginal shots, you're going to struggle to make par.
Q.  Looks like Sunday is really shaping up for an anybody's race.
KIRK TRIPLETT:  Well, you've got a couple of guys up there that are pretty good.  One guy has won a bunch of tournaments.  Singh, yeah, that guy (laughter).

He's going to be the guy that's been doing it all year, and one of us is going to have to track him down if we want to beat him.  He's not going to go out there and give it away.
Q.  Are you surprised that the field is as bunched as it is right now?
KIRK TRIPLETT:  No, not really.  Like I say, the greens are receptive enough that you can make some birdies and recover.

I haven't played here in the past, but I do know the course has toughened up considerably since Thursday.  For me it's very simple.  To get in the Top 30 I need to win or maybe finish 2nd alone to have a shot at it.  I haven't looked at it that close.

I've been to Kapalua a couple times and I'd like to go back.  That's what I'm here for.
Q.  And all you have to do is beat Vijay Singh.
KIRK TRIPLETT:  I'll try not to put any faces on that leaderboard.  I'll try to go out and do my own thing.
