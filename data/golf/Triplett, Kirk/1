 Q.  Tell me about what this is like to finish up this tournament at Notre Dame.  
KIRK TRIPLETT: We've been looking forward to it for a long time, having had a son went to school here, so it's pretty neat.  Pretty neat week for us.  Good to get with everybody and to have him see his friends, and to do well is just kind of icing on the cake.   
So the outcome of the tournament really wasn't in doubt for the last two days, but still happy to get a top 10 finish.   
 Q.  Tell me about you play.  
KIRK TRIPLETT: It was good.  We're out here trying to win tournaments, so you're a little bit disappointed, would have liked to challenged a little bit more.  But I'm not sure I had 19-under in me.   
 Q.  And then your son I think was a women's basketball practice player?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Yeah, he was on the team for Coach McGraw and the national championship team, he was -- the last couple years ago he was on the squad.  So he really enjoyed that.  He did that for a couple of seasons.  He was an RA at Alumni Hall.  He was very involved with stuff going on around campus.  So he had a great time at Notre Dame.
