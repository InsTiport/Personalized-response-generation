 Q.  Kirk, we watched you dominate this golf course for three days.  You get to the final day, what was different today?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Well, I didn't play very well.  Kenny played nice.  He had control of his ball right from the get-go.  I did not so it was a real struggle for me.   
Quite frankly, after the middle of the round, I'm thrilled that I had a chance to force him to make that putt on the last hole.  I mean, it was looking like I was heading down into the pack.  So I was glad to kind of resurrect it and at least make him earn it.   
 Q.  A lot of guys would have packed it in standing on that 10th tee.  You're four down.  Now you're in the flower pot on No. 18.  You clawed your way back, you scratched your way back.  But he just seemed to have all the answers, didn't he?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Yeah, he's a solid player.  Always hits the ball really well.  Any time you get a tough golf course, tough conditions, he's going to be a guy to be reckoned with.   
He missed a short putt and then he had a poor shot on 15, and there was a little glimmer of hope there, and he knocked that -- he played the hole correctly because he had no chance to get close to the pin.  He played it to 20 feet, holed it out.  Big putt.   
 Q.  What can you do?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: He's doing the things you need to do to win golf tournaments, and I didn't.   
 Q.  Still an amazing week.  Thanks for the time, Kirk.  We enjoyed watching.  
KIRK TRIPLETT: I'm thrilled.  I had a great time in Salem.  I hope the USGA comes back here again.
