 Q.   Talk about your round.   I know you came in with two birdies on 11 and 17.   
KIRK TRIPLETT:   Yeah, I ended up at 3‑under.   It was a little different after the rain delay, maybe.   But the breeze, a little breezier.  
Probably not quite good enough to get in the hunt, depending what the leaders do, but happy to get around under par.   So kind of played a little bit scruffy, made some 10 foot putts that were key to keeping my round going.   So happy with that part of it.  
   
 Q.   Did you have any mud balls or anything like that?  
KIRK TRIPLETT:   Not‑‑ I didn't have anything that I could blame it on.   I just hit bad shots.   
   
 Q.   What about tomorrow?   What do you think you're going to have to do maybe put some pressure on the leaders?  
KIRK TRIPLETT:   Well, it will take a low round for sure.   That's one thing about this Champions Tour, these guys have all been in had this situation before and maybe the odd guy goes backwards, but not a whole bunch of guys so it will take a real low round for me, 6‑, 7‑under.
