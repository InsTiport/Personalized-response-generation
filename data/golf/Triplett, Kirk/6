 Q.  The ebb and flow of your round today, how would you describe your play today?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Which way is backwards, is that the ebb?  We started with some flow and then we had a lot of ebb.  That's the way the course is today, a lot of fire coming in, a lot of into-the-wind holes.  It was just playing long, long, long.   
 Q.  How would you describe conditions today compared to the first two?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Well, I think there were times the second day when it blew hard like this but it was for a short time.  This was sustained from -- we walked on to 7 tee and it just seemed to go from that ten to 15, which is comfortable.  I mean, difficult, challenging, to all right, now I have to start thinking about where I'm land it, and now I'm hitting different clubs than I hit the day before.  You know, now I've got to really avoid some of those places where I'm going to make a big number.   
So you just immediately switched into defense there about the seventh hole today and never got out of it.   
 Q.  You say defense.  So tomorrow, you're going to be chasing.  Will you have to play offense?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: I don't know, tomorrow it might be 82 degrees and sunny and no wind.   
It's so challenging.  If there's just one guy that's out there with a lead, it's such a dangerous course, right.  You can hit a good shot and it's flush up against the face of the bunker, and your whole day changes.   
So you just can't get ahead of yourself out here, and fortunately, it's the kind of course that you know that, right.  So that's your challenge, right.  Yeah, you want to hit the ball well.  You want to make putts.
