  KIRK TRIPLETT:   His game looks like it always has.   He's got beautiful rhythm, a wonderful player, great ball striker, never gets flustered, at least what you can see on the outside, and he rolled that putt in on 17, just nails it, and that was it, and forced me into trying to hit a shot right at the end of my reach on 18, trying to hit a 3‑wood up and over a bunker and stop it on a green.   I didn't execute, and even if I didn't, still, tough chance to make a 3.   
You know, I was happy.   I hit some bad shots in the middle of the round and made a great par save and two birdies in a row and put some pressure on him, and he won the golf tournament.   
   
 Q.   Anything that you could have done differently?   You made the great par putt on 13, 14‑‑  
KIRK TRIPLETT:   It was a little chip‑in, yeah, on the par‑5.   You know, I played‑‑ I hit a lot of nice shots this week.   It wasn't perfect by any means.   I had some chances that I missed, but I made some putts, too.   I can't look at my rounds and go, oh, man, there's a shot there or two there and one there.   I played nice golf, and 15‑under is good.   I don't care where you're at.   17‑under beats it every time.  
   
 Q.   A win and a second in North Carolina.   Do you want more tournaments in North Carolina?  
KIRK TRIPLETT:   Well, I think that makes it significantly more powerful, to have a win in my back pocket.   I would be probably be much more upset with what transpired on 18, not making the birdie, ending up tied for second.   I would have been frustrated feeling like I left some money and some finish points out there.   
You know, the win last week takes the sting out of it a little bit.
