KIRK TRIPLETT:  I drug Mike right down in the mud with me today and we rolled around for a while.  We didn't play much good golf out there, but I kind of left him ‑‑ I got up on him and I had a couple of putts to end the match and I didn't do it, and I knew he was going to birdie that last hole.  So it was no surprise to me I had to make that putt.  And I'm thrilled to death I knocked it in, because I haven't been making many of them.
Q.  Does it feel like an upset to you?
KIRK TRIPLETT:  Yeah, it feels like an upset to me.  Mike didn't play well at all.  He was hooking the ball.  And he doesn't hook the ball unless he wants to.  So I caught him on a bad day.  I almost didn't play well enough to take advantage of it.

I think if you look at this Tour, there are 10 or 12 guys that are really on top of their game and four or five maybe even above that.  And after that, the rest of us I think are pretty even.
Q.  Thrilled to get a chance to play tomorrow?
KIRK TRIPLETT:  Yes.
Q.  He was hooking the ball a lot?
KIRK TRIPLETT:  Yeah, he hit a couple of pulled drives and we took turns giving each other holes, really.  He three‑putted a hole out there on the front and kind of got me off to a 1‑up lead.
Q.  What hole was that?
KIRK TRIPLETT:  The par‑3 that goes up the hill, No. 3, so it's No. 12.
Q.  Is that where you got 1‑up on him?
KIRK TRIPLETT:  That's where I got 1‑up on him, yeah.
