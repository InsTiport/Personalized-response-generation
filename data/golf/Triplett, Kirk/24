Q.   Talk about your round today. 
KIRK TRIPLETT:   I got off to a good start.   I think the course was setup for some birdies on the front nine.   Just wasn't able to carry it through.   Struggled a little bit the last four or five holes and happy to shoot 3â€‘under, but needed to shoot six or seven. 

Q.   Overall, how would you characterize your play for the entire tournament?
KIRK TRIPLETT:   Well it's a little sloppy.   I hit enough good shots to do well, but I hit too many bad ones.   So I made a lot of bogeys.   Kind of drove the ball poorly when I needed to hit some good drives.   But I putted well, so I'm looking forward to the next couple weeks.

Q.   And overall how was the experience here this week?
KIRK TRIPLETT:   Fabulous tournament.   A nice golf course, great, lot of tradition, wonderful condition, beautiful setup with all the stand and all the people that were out watching.   So it felt like 30 years ago.
