 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Good.  Windy.  Consistent.  Yeah, a little breeze up-and-down a little bit but more because of the hillside.  So I thought picking clubs was easier today.  It was tougher because the greens were firmer in spots.  You're a couple behind, trying to be a little more aggressive in spots and it jumped up and bit me early and I misjudged a couple.  The wind was a little stronger than I thought it was on a couple of shots, but overall I felt like I see what the winning score is, I'm pretty disappointed, I feel like I could have shot that this week.  Wasted a lot of shots.  But I'm sure everybody in the field can say the same thing.   
 Q.  Were you looking more at the board than you normally do the way things were bunching up?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: You can't avoid the boards.  It doesn't matter where you play.  If you're a professional golfer you can't avoid the boards.  You got to know what you got to do.  I saw a couple of tight pins on the back nine and I missed -- I hit a really good iron on 12 to a really tight pin and missed the putt.  Hit a good putt, just didn't hit it hard enough.  And then I started kind of shying a way from a couple of the tight pins and it cost me.  I had a couple of 3-putts and because I was kind of figuring 2, 3, 4, that would be in with a chance.  And I was at 1 at the time and I didn't want to make a kind of a stupid bogey.  But I 3-putted twice and that was kind of it for me.  So now I'm just trying to makes a much as I can.   
(Laughter.)   
Like every other week.   
 Q.  A Top-8.  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Yeah, no, if you told me at the start of the week I'm going to have a chance to win and finish 8th I would say awesome, man, can't wait, let's go do it.  But right now it doesn't feel all that great.
