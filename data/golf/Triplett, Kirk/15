 Q.  Kirk, another round, and you continue to go lower than anybody has in a U.S. Senior Open, but you look over your shoulder and, literally and figuratively, there's Kenny Perry.  He told us it almost felt like match play out there.  Did you feel the same?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: I think so.  You don't want to get caught up on that on Saturday.  I think what we both did want to do is distance ourselves a little bit from the pack.   
So looking up on the board early, you could see Brandt Jobe shot an 8 under par round.  So you're sort of feeling these guys at 6, 7 and 8, one of them can throw a 5 or 6.  So when we both made some birdies early, I think we both felt more comfortable as the day went on, having a little cushion.   
 Q.  You handled this golf course so well.  The fact that you didn't even need your putter on a couple of the holes today.  Walk me through these here.  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Just a straightforward bunker shot.  Kenny hit right before me and hit a beautiful one.  I was trying to match him, right in the jar.  So I guess --   
 Q.  A little bit of luck too.  
KIRK TRIPLETT: A lot of luck.  I've been with this wedge a long, long time.  I know what it does on different conditions and different shots, and I'm very comfortable with it.   
The times I've won tournaments, I've had hole-outs.  So it's been a weapon for me.   
 Q.  It's a nice little piece of history to have there, nice hole-outs.  
 Kirk, we've enjoyed watching you, looking forward to what has become a duel at the U.S. Senior Open tomorrow.   
KIRK TRIPLETT: You don't want to count all those guys out yet.  Kenny and I would like to get off to a good start tomorrow.  Maybe on the back nine, we'll look at each other and see who's got it who doesn't.
