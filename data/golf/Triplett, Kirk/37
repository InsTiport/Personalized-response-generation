Q.
Happy Halloween (laughter).
KIRK TRIPLETT:  I've always tried to do something.  I try and be topical and have a good time with it, so I just kind of thought it up this morning since I saw my pairing, and Jesper was a natural guy to try and imitate.  It doesn't look quite as good on me as it does on him.  I need to go the gym a little bit more.

He was a great sport about it.  I asked him about it coming up the last hole.  He didn't want to do it early in the round or anything like that because we were both trying to win the golf tournament.  There at the end he hit a good shot, he's on the green, and I'm on the green.  I thought we could have a little fun and he was a great sport, and he said, "Go ahead."
Q.  You had a little trouble with that belt on the first go-around?
KIRK TRIPLETT:  Yeah, it didn't fit.  The loops on my pants aren't quite ready for those mod belts.
Q.  You were playing very well today, that close to the Tour Championship.
KIRK TRIPLETT:  Oh, extremely.  I mean, I was playing for that all week.  It was a little frustrating to have Vijay go out there and just keep going and going and going and never get within three or four shots of him, so you didn't feel like you had a chance to win the tournament.

I was still trying to get to 13- or 14-under.  I hit a pretty decent shot in on 15 and just got over the green there a little bit, and I knew the way the last three holes play, you've got to try and make a birdie there.

So I went to chip on the ball, trying to land it on the green and run it up, and I fluffed it and missed the putt, and then I think I just kind of lost my focus there on 16, drove it in the water.

But then hit good shots coming in.  I'm thrilled with a great tournament, had my chances, and I sure would have liked to have gone to Eastlake next week.
