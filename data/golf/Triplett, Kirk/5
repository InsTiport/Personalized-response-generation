 Q.  Verdict on your round today?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: I needed to be two better. So I got off to a good start, considering it was tough conditions, and I hit a couple bad shots but I made birdies after them so I felt fortunate. I felt like I was really playing well in the middle of the round.   
The wind played down on the second shot on No. 12 and it just kind of caught me off guard and took me a couple holes to kind of re-orient and by that I'm I had dropped a couple shots and playing catch up.   
 Q.  How special was it walking up 18?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Well, just the whole day, playing this great venue. I haven't played hardly any golf over here but I can see why guys really fall in love with it. When you do well and you're in contention and you're playing with a great player like Bernhard Langer, and you're walking up the 18th hole at St. Andrews, that's pretty special.   
 Q.  Overall, a top three finish. Been a very enjoyable week?  
KIRK TRIPLETT: Well, yeah, if you'd have told me at the start of the week I was going to finish third, I'd come over all the time. But just it's nice to be in the thick of it, have a chance and have the pressure of trying to hit good shots and it's awkward and doing all this stuff, it's just a fun place to compete.
