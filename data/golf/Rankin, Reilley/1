 Q.  Reilley, I know you were down by two at one point, or three, can you talk about coming back from that deficit and winning by two? 
 REILLEY RANKIN:  Yeah, I won 3 & 2.  The first hole -- it started on the first hole, I hit it probably ten feet and she hit it 30 or 40 feet and made it.  It was a great match and I just hung in there. 

 Q.  That was the turning point? 
 REILLEY RANKIN:  Yeah, I just hung in there. I knew it wasn't over.  I knew match play is match play. 

 Q.  Do you prefer to play like this, kind of a back and forth thing where you know what you have to do, rather than just go shoot a number? 
 REILLEY RANKIN:  Yeah, it's fun.  It's a lot of fun to do it, having a nice -- something different in the middle of the year.  It's fun.  You're never out of it.  It's one match at a time, so rather than a tournament of four days of pacing yourself -- but I learned a lot about even tournament golf today. 
 Just, you know, when you're in match play, you're so -- I don't know, I think it's easier to be in the present.  I think we made eight or nine birdies on the first seven holes between the two of us, but a lot of them were on the same holes.  I just kept grinding. 

 Q.  It worked out? 
 REILLEY RANKIN:  It worked out. 

 Q.  Have you allowed yourself to look ahead to tomorrow?  Have you looked ahead at the bracket? 
 REILLEY RANKIN:  I think I'm playing Carin Koch. 

 Q.  Game plan for tomorrow or is it too early? 
 REILLEY RANKIN:  Same thing. 

 Q.  Stay in the moment? 
 REILLEY RANKIN:  Yeah, you really have to focus, whatever situation you're in out there and go from there.
