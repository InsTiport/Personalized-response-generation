 Q. Just talk about how the golf course was playing today. Start by talking about the experience to be here at the PGA and to play here in the first round. 
 KEN DUKE: It's great. The golf course is getting firm and that's going to be the toughest thing. 
 I think for some of these pins you just can't get to them. You just got to scramble to make your par and get along with a birdie now and then. 
 But it's been good. 

 Q. Talk about your finish here on the last hole. 
 KEN DUKE: It was great. I hit a bad tee shot and then I had a good lie and hit a perfect rescue club up there and it ran right up there and made the putt. 
 It was great to finish that way.
