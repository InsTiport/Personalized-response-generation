Q.   Looks like it's going to have you hanging around for the weekend.
KEN DUKE:   Yeah.   Just didn't have it on my front nine, my back 9.   Hit a lot of bad shots, and I have no excuse for it, but yeah, it's good to finish strong and be here for the weekend.   That's what you always want to do.

Q.   When you see the conditions like this and you think the course is probably playing a little perfect, is it a little frustrating to not have the wheels spin like that for a while?
KEN DUKE:   I think so.   I had some good numbers on my first nine holes and I just didn't hit good shots.   There's just no excuse for it.   I just kind of got behind the 8 ball and I hit a few bad ones over there on 16. 
The wind got me a little bit, but I fought back on the front, and the conditions were a little bit‑‑ a little more wind than we had yesterday, obviously, but that's the tricky part of this golf course.   It happens that way, and it can get you thinking out there instead of just having fun.

Q.   What was it down the stretch?   Hitting it close, putting it close?
KEN DUKE:   Just made a couple of putts.   I holed a bunker shot on 2.   I birdied the par‑5, and then I birdied No. 8.   Hit it close on the last and it just lipped out and that's kind of the way the day went all day, but it's good to be playing the weekend and I look forward to the great weather up here.
