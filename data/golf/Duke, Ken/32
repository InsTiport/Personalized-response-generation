   KEN DUKE: Today I had two bogeys, and I missed two inside five feet. That's the difference. That's it. 
 It's definitely there if there's no wind. 

 Q. You've been playing so well recently. Do you feel that your game is back to the level that you wanted it? 
 KEN DUKE: It is. I've got to change my west coast swing. I haven't done too well out there last few years. We're try something different next year and hopefully have a good rest of the year like we had last year.

 Q. Justin Timberlake hosting the event this year. You going to the concert tonight, or are you doing something else? 
 KEN DUKE: I will be there. He's a great entertainer and a great person. I'm really looking forward to going and seeing what he has to offer.
