Q.   Great start for you.   I know you're very, very pleased. 
KEN DUKE:   Yeah, great.   I have an exemption this week.   I'm very thankful for that.   Out of 20 years, I've received a couple and I'm very honored for that. 
The Nicklaus family is very special.   This golf course is as special as it gets.   I have a lot of memories today and just kept the ball in play and made a few putts.   The greens are really, really fast.

Q.   You birdied 8 and 16, those par‑3s that are really tough.   That had to be a highlight today?
KEN DUKE:   Yeah, it was really good.   8 was a perfect 8‑iron, hit it like a couple feet and hit it pretty good, about 15 feet on 16, which was a really quick putt and it went right in.   It was great.

Q.   Scoring conditions I think were really, really good this morning, weren't they?
KEN DUKE:   They were.   We didn't have much wind at all.   It's picking up a little bit now.   But it gets circling back there on the back nine in the wind on the hole back there.   But it's a golf course you've got to be patient and you've got to take your punishment when you can and fight on.

Q.   Lastly, you mentioned sponsors exemptions, does that spur you on, is that motivation?
KEN DUKE:   It's just an honor to receive one, to be considered to get one.   It's very tough to get them out here.   People that get them are guys that have been out here a long time and just kind of going out of their career. 
But for me it's really special.   The Nicklaus family, like I said, is very special to me, to get a chance to see them a lot and play in their charity events.   They're a first class family.   And just excited to be here.
