Q. Great day.  Bogey-free, 4-under 67, bogey-free.  Just what was going right for you?
KEN DUKE: This golf course is so tricky with the wind and tried to keep the ball in front of us.  That's what we have to do here.  I got it up and down a few times.  Keep the round going.  I chipped in a couple times.  It was tough.  We didn't try to get too aggressive and just tried to keep it in front of us.  That was the key.
Q. With the wind the way it was and in a round like this, what does it for you mentally?  Feel like it's been coming?
KEN DUKE: It's great, just wanted to get off to a good day.  Haven't been able to do that.  It's good.  It's good.  It's good to get off to a good start.  Lot of golf to be played but it's always good to get off to a good start.
Q. You've had kind of mixed success here.  Finished in the Top-5 in the past and the past couple of years have been struggles.
Is this a course that you feel like when you get off to a good start it suits your game?
KEN DUKE: I like it because I hit it straight and you have to hit it straight here.  I flight the ball and I have to flight it here because of the wind.  My caddy and I went down to see Mr. Toski, got a lot of good work last week.  Had a lot of good short game work at my club at the Floridian last week.  Got to be patient.
