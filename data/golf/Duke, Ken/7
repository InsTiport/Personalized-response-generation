Q. Off in the second to last group on this Sunday.  What was it like out there with the crowds and trying to catch Jason to win this PLAYERS?
KEN DUKE: It was electric, to be honest with you.  A lot of great fans here.  Obviously, we had great weather for them to come out, which that's what the PLAYERS need to have good weather, where we get a bunch of people out here.  It's really nice.
It's just tough to catch him.  I gave a little run there early, but hit a bad shot on 6 and didn't give myself a chance for a birdie there.
Just didn't birdie 9.
But it was a great week for me.  All the stuff I been through with all my foot problems and all my wrist problems, I'll take it.  It's really nice.
Q. To shoot 12-under the last three days, including that 65 on Saturday, you mentioned what you've been through, where do you go from here with that experience?
KEN DUKE: Just got to keep pushing forward and go as much as you can.  I knew I did something special when Adam Scott and Poulter and Rory and Steve or Shane Lowry, they were giving me a hard time yesterday like what course did you play?  You know, and what a great round it was.  And just gave me some confidence going into today to try to finish it off.
Q. How much doubt was there in your mind wondering whether you could get back to this level of play?
KEN DUKE: I never thought that at all.  I just need to be healthy.  I had my wrist injury and plantar fascia on my foot, those two doctors that I had, Doctor Barrett and Doctor Forster, they got me back in the game and all their therapists, I can't thank them enough for all the help that they done.
