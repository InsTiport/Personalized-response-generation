   KEN DUKE: I didn't drive it good, but it's hard to get aggressive out there the greens are so fast and slick. It seemed like it wasn't tough out there, but I guess it was because of the scores being what they are. I didn't think the wind was going. I didn't think the wind was going to blow, but it blew harder than I thought it was going to. We all played good in our group and we all hit some pretty good shots. I didn't have too many chances today, so I'm happy where I am.
