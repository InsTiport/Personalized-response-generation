Q.   It had to have made everything feel better after today.
KEN DUKE:   I've had that putt before and I knew it was very difficult and I told my caddy before I left the tee, "This is the toughest hole, we really got to concentrate." 
It came over that hill and hit a good shot.   Right in the center.   Probably would have rolled by five, six feet but it was right in the center, which is great.

Q.   What's your feeling, yesterday you hit all but one green.   Today, it was 11 of 18.   You still put up a 68 that puts you very, very close to the lead at the end of the day. 
What's your feeling about the way that this day transpired?
KEN DUKE:   It was good.   Obviously yesterday we had a little less wind in the morning and today it circled a lot.   I didn't drive it as good as I did, seemed like I did yesterday.   But I had some good numbers yesterday.   Today I didn't.   Seemed like it was circling out there.   Just good to get around and get to the shots and keep in front of it.

Q.   Did you learn anything from 2007 that you're using now?
KEN DUKE:   Just having fun.   Seemed like that day I was having a lot of fun.   It seems like I'm doing that this year.

Q.   Overall, a pretty good round.   Little bit tougher this afternoon than yesterday.   Talk about your round.
KEN DUKE:   It was solid.   Missed a few early but hit some good shots after that, made a few.   That's the way Mr. Dye makes you think around here.   Tough holes out here with a lot of water.   Tough day with the wind.

Q.   Talking about you turned around a little bit more on the back-9.   You're in contention.
KEN DUKE:   You can't win it on the first day or second day.   You can probably get yourself in contention for the weekend.   That's all you try to do, have fun with it and see what happens.
