Q.   Ken, four rounds in the 60s, back in the hunt on a Sunday on the PGA TOUR. 
KEN DUKE:   That's what it's all about.   You just want to compete every week, and we worked hard to get to where we are right here.   We played good today.   When you win, I think you've got to play a little bit better than what we've done.   But it was a really exciting week.

Q.   You ran that putt in at 14 and you gave it a little extra.   But Peter Hanson told me five hours ago, the Snake Pit actually begins at 15 and it's a tough road in. 
KEN DUKE:   Yeah, 15, I had a perfect club.   I really thought I could hit it close and I did hit a good shot.   But 16, it is what it is, and 17 is a tough one and 18 is, too.   I guess that's why they call it the Copperhead.   It's a good test. 

Q.   Tough to make birdies coming down the stretch?
KEN DUKE:   Yeah, it is, you have to make some long putts, 30â€‘footers or so.   It was a good week.   I was walking with Vijay and we are always thinking about Jarrod Lyle.   Pulling for him.   We're pulling for him.
