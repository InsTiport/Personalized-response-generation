  Q. A couple days ago you said that you're hitting the ball well, frustrating not getting the ball in the hole. Did today help your psyche?  
 KEN DUKE: Yeah. Two I should have made. Made one probably 60 footer on 11. It all equals out in my book. I hit some good shots. Greens a little slower so you can be a little more aggressive with the putt. I had a few go in today.  
  
  Q. 66, where do you think that's going to be at the end of the day?  
 KEN DUKE: I'm hoping top 15. There's not much wind. I don't know -- I don't watch the weather. I don't know other than that. Hopefully.  
  
  Q. Do you like this style of golf course which is tremendously offensive and birdies are out there?  
 KEN DUKE: I do. I think that's what the fans want and the players enjoy it because it's a struggle everyday and a fight everyday to play these hard golf courses with the hard greens and deep rough. You get something like this if you can, make some birdies. You know, it's good.  
  
  Q. You said your caddy may check for you the projections in the FedExCup. Did he?  
 KEN DUKE: I don't even know. We haven't talked about that. We won't talk about it until Sunday. It is whatever it is.  
  
  Q. Thank you.  
 KEN DUKE: I appreciate it guys.
