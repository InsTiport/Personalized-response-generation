  Q. Easier when the guy you're playing with is playing well?  
 KEN DUKE: It is good, but you don't want him to beat you. With both hit good shots and he got a couple ahead of me. It's a great day and he's a great guy and it was great fun.  
  
  Q. How much do you like playing here at Warwick Hills?  
 KEN DUKE: It's great. I putted well all week, and that's the difference. The greens are usually pretty fast and firm, and it's hard to putt though. Hit a lot of good putts all week, and it's just great.  
  
  Q. Especially late in the afternoon, these kind of greens can get a little bumpy.   
 KEN DUKE: Yeah, I just saw it all week and putted good all week.   
 I got off to a good start. Had a couple putts on 5 and 6 that I should have made but I didn't make them. But I didn't play 10 through 14 as well as I should. I made eagle but the other ones I didn't make birdies and I think that's the difference on this golf course.   
  
  Q. Have you played this course before?  
 KEN DUKE: This is my third time. I made the cut both times. This is my third time making the cut. I haven't finished as well as I did today, but that's the way it goes. Sometimes you play well and sometimes you don't. It's a great atmosphere here and Michigan really turns out for the event and it's really great.
