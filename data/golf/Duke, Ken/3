Q. Lots of red numbers out there.
KEN DUKE: Well, I made some putts.  I've played this way every single day, I just haven't played any putts.  The first two days DiMarco made the putts and I did not.  I'm hitting a lot of fairways, and you can hit a lot of greens but just very difficult to make some putts, and today I did make a few.
Q. Did you hit it close or --
KEN DUKE: A couple close, but a few 15-, 20-footers that I have not been making.  But no, it was a good day.
Q. How about the way the course was playing today compared to the first two rounds?  Any difference in firmness?
KEN DUKE: It's getting a little firmer.  It's funny, I saw Mike Davis on 13 before I teed off and I said, How's things going, and he said, It's quiet, and I said, That's a good thing, and he said, Yeah.
It's fair.  The scores would be a lot lower if we didn't get that rain earlier in the week.  But it's a good test.  It's getting there.  It's getting firm.  The last hole I hit a perfect shot in the middle of the green and it went over the green and I made bogey.  The afternoon groups are going to get that firmness.
But you've still got to hit good shots no matter what.  I hit a lot of good shots.  We had some good numbers for a change instead of in between, and that certainly helps a lot when you're out there playing.
