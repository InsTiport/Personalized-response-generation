Q. So, another strong round today.  What was the key to your good play out there?
IN GEE CHUN: I had three bogies today, but it was really a good finish on the 18th hole.  Then I closed the putting lines very well today.
Q. With the eagle on 18, what club did you hit into the green and how far was the putt?
IN GEE CHUN: It was 222 meters, and I hit the 3-wood.  The eagle putt was nine feet maybe, yeah.
Q. You gave the crowd a pretty good fist pump there.  It must have felt pretty nice when that one went in?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah.  I felt very happy.  So, just try to do ceremony, yeah.
Q. What do you have to do to keep going on the weekend?
IN GEE CHUN: My goal is top three this week.  So I can try.
