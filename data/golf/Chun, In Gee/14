 Q.  Talk about how your day went.  
IN GEE CHUN: First nine hole I could see the putting lines very well but I was not rolling the ball those line.   
So I stayed patient, and then I made four birdies from back nine.   
 Q.  You're in line for possibly winning another big award, the Vare Trophy.  What would that mean to you?  
IN GEE CHUN: It's good challenging for me.  And then I know Lydia really good player, so she's great person, people.   
So I always enjoy the challenging, because without challenging feels boring and nothing.   
It was good.
