 Q.  Five straight birdies; why?  
IN GEE CHUN: Well, I didn't know I made five straight birdies.   
 Q.  You didn't?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah.  I just focused on my shots.  I did not feel well this morning.   
 Q.  You didn't feel well like physically, like your stomach?  
IN GEE CHUN: No, because the weather, and because I have allergies.  It's really bad.  I did not feel good.  And it was a lot of windy today, so I did not play with high expectations, but I could focus on my game better, and I play with Candie and Kelly today, and really thank them for making me feel comfortable.  And my friends are here.  I was so happy to see them enjoying my play, then I focused more on my game.
