 Q.  The conditions out there today obviously very windy.  How do you assess the golf course today?  Was it hard today?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yesterday was windy too, so maybe last nine holes.  So it was good experience for today, and then I'm just enjoy with windy today.   
Also I play with Ariya.  I always happy to play with her.  So I have really great time with her and then her caddie.   
 Q.  This is your I believe fourth second-place finish this season.  How would you assess your season?  Do you feel like you've been playing well this year?  
IN GEE CHUN: Um, very close.   
 Q.  Very close, okay.  
IN GEE CHUN: So during the wintertime I changed a little bit for my swing.  I think almost there, so everything is good.  Yeah.   
That's it, yeah.  She made really great putt.   
 Q.  Could you tell right away?  
IN GEE CHUN: I couldn't see the (indiscernible) very well, but speed was little short but she made it.   
 Q.  Looks like you had a lot the fun out there with her.  You guys were laughing a lot; selfies back here.  Caught you guys in the act.  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah.  Because she's very great person, so I'm always happy with her.  On the course it's same.  Yeah.
