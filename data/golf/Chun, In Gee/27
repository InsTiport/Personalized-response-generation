 Q.  When they announced you on your first hole as the winner of the 2015 Women's Open, what did you think?  What was your feeling?  Were you happy?  Was it surprising?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, I'm so happy because I love pressure.  I have played well under pressure, so I enjoy it.   
 Q.  Today were you happy with the way you played or did you feel like you could have played better?  
IN GEE CHUN: I play with Hannah and Stacy today.  They're such good players so I enjoy it, yeah.   
 Q.  So when you have that defending champion behind your name, you say you play well with pressure, do you feel that pressure and it doesn't bother you or does the pressure make it harder for you?  
IN GEE CHUN: Nothing, yeah.   
 Q.  You have a very good smiley way about yourself, is that the way you try to approach your golf, too?  Always positive?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yes, because I can't control weather, another player's score, greens condition.  So I just enjoy my game.  So I always happy.   
 Q.  How many more under par could you have been if you had made some putts?  
IN GEE CHUN: I don't know, maybe 5-under.   
 Q.  The course is there for low scores, then, you think?  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, because greens are wet, soft.  So is more easy.   
 Q.  So you wouldn't be surprised if I told you that Mirim Lee shot 8-under today.  
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, but she's pretty nice player.  She plays really well.
