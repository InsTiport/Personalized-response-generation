 Q.  As the defending champion you missed the cut.  Can you give me your thoughts on that, please?  
IN GEE CHUN: The triple bogey at the No. 8 tee was a killer to me.  And right after that triple bogey I didn't concentrate on my long game for a while.  That was the key for today.   
I learned a lot from the play here at the 2016 U.S. Women's Open as the defending champion.  It was a great experience again.   
With all the learning and experiences here I'll be more prepared for the next major tournament and I look forward to it, and I'm sure I'll show everybody something.
