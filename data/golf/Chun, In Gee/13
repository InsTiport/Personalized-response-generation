THE MODERATOR: You kind of raised your hand up in celebration.  Did you know at that point that you had won the Vare Trophy?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, I know before (indiscernible), so on the green.  So it was pressure for me, but I'm just try enjoy my last putt on the green.
THE MODERATOR: So three straight birdies at the end of your round.  A lot of the players, some players say it's the most important to them because scoring average really shows consistency over the year.  What does it mean to you, winning this honor?
IN GEE CHUN: It was big honor for me, because to have my name next to legends, and then I play with Lydia and Amy today.  (Indiscernible), and I always play with them.  I know she's great, but Lydia is great player.
I learned from her a lot.
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. You were the first person since Nancy Lopez to win Rookie of the Year and the Vare Trophy in the same year.  Were you aware of that coming in?  How much history are you aware of regarding Nancy Lopez and what she was accomplishing here?
IN GEE CHUN: Just amazing.  I know it was big challenging for me.  I have big honor, yeah.
THE MODERATOR: Do you know much about Nancy Lopez and what she was able to accomplish on this tour?  She pretty much had one of the best rookie seasons ever in the history of the LPGA, so to put yourself in that same class is pretty special.
Q. (Regarding the speech.)
IN GEE CHUN: I think it was more pressure than winning putt, speech.  So I'm just start one week before.  I try to do my best.  Was good.  So after this Rookie of the Year speech I get more confident.  Everything is more comfortable, getting more comfortable.
THE MODERATOR: How many times did you practice that speech?
IN GEE CHUN: I don't know, maybe 100 times.  (Laughter.)
THE MODERATOR: It showed.
Q. When you saw the pairings and realized you would be playing alongside Lydia, were you happy about that, that your competition would be right in front of you?
IN GEE CHUN: It was always happy to play with her.  She's great person.  Yeah.  I got energy from her.  Happy vibes.
THE MODERATOR: We saw Lydia hug you right after you finished.  What did she say to you?
IN GEE CHUN: Big congratulations In Gee, and you need buy dinner next time.  (Laughter.)
