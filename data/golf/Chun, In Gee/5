Q. Great round today.  Started off interesting with a double bogey, but a lot of birdies.  How do you feel?
IN GEE CHUN: Yeah, I did not start well.  I made double bogey on the first hole.  After that, walking to second tee I said, Forget it; start again.  Then I try staying be patient.  Made a lot of birdies after first hole.
Also today is my caddie Dylan and my manager Kylie birthday, so I try more focus on my game.  I want to say happy birthday to them.  Yeah.
Q. What was the best part of your game today?
IN GEE CHUN: Honestly, before the start tournament my shot was not good.  I try think about percentage on the course.
Also, I try stay middle of the green.  It was made a lot of birdie chance on the green.
Q. You play well on difficult courses.  This course has been likened to a major championship course.  The greens are firm; rough is up; every thing seems to be in major championship condition.  Has that helped you?  And if so, how?
IN GEE CHUN: I'm always enjoy to play the tough course because a lot of challenging there.  Without challenge, my feel was too boring, then nothing.
I think this mind is make a good finish there.  Tough course, yeah.
Q. Do you like where you stand as you head into the weekend with your solid score?
IN GEE CHUN: I had good memory here because last year I made nine birdies during the third round.
I know my shot was not perfect now, so I try keep focus on my game and then try think about percentage game and then see where I am later.
Q. How motivated were you playing with a partner who was playing so well?
IN GEE CHUN: Shanshan and Suzann?  Yeah, I always happy to play with them because Suzann is really good friend of me, and then Shanshan is good person.  I really enjoy to play with them.
Also they play was so good, so I hope they're getting more better during the weekend.
