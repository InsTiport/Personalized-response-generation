 Q.  How do you feel like you played out there today?  
IN GEE CHUN: Today I could see the putting lines very well, and I was so good at rolling the ball on those lines, and I made really good up-and-downs today.  Those really got my game going.   
 Q.  You're in a pretty good position heading into tomorrow.  You have a chance to win.  What's going to be the key for you out there?  
IN GEE CHUN: Tomorrow I'm going to just focus on my game against the golf course and see where I am later.
