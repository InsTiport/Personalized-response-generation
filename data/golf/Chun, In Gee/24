 Q.  What were your feelings after the very first shot at the first tee?  
AMY YANG: First tee, I was so nervous on the first tee, because it's a lot different from what we used to do from regular tournaments.   
 Q.  Was there more energy do you feel like?  
AMY YANG: Yes, it was a good atmosphere.  It felt like I really had to do well.   
 Q.  A lot of pressure, I'm sure.  What do you think was the reason behind that chemistry?  
AMY YANG: Too many good tensions out there and made some good putts early in this round, but late in the afternoon I started to make some mistakes here and there.  I only need to make par just to take some pressure off In Gee, but I just kept making mistakes.  Gave her a lot of pressure today, important putts out there.   
 Q.  But it worked, the energy worked.  Do you think you have the same sense of humor?  
AMY YANG: Just good timing, you know.   
IN GEE CHUN: She makes everyone feel comfortable, so I feel very comfortable today.   
 Q.  I think that's a really, really good reason, yeah.  
IN GEE CHUN: Shanshan and Jing are two of the most wonderful persons and two best Chinese players.  We're just lucky to get two points against them.   
 Q.  How do you make your teammate feel comfortable?  
AMY YANG: We talk about -- we live not far from each other.  She lives in Orlando.  We are team calm.  We are very calm.  We talk about meeting in Orlando, going to Disney together, just talk, a lot of talking.   
 Q.  What is your sort of strategy or thinking going into tomorrow?  Is it going to be the same as today?  
AMY YANG: We are playing again tomorrow, and we are going to keep doing what we've been doing.
