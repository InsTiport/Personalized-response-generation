Q. Another good round to get to 10-under.  What was the key to your game?
IN GEE CHUN: Stay patient, because first back nine was not really good, so I miss some birdie opportunities.  I try staying patient.
So I made really good back nine, yeah.
Q. You had birdied on 16 and 17.  What happened on those two holes?
IN GEE CHUN: I can't remember 16.
Q. Drove it on the green; drivable par-4.
IN GEE CHUN: I hit driver and it was on the green.  It was how many?
SPEAKER: 39 feet.
IN GEE CHUN: 39 feet and just easy birdie to putt.
Then 17 --
SPEAKER: The par-5.
IN GEE CHUN: Okay, tee shot.  Then I want to make the good number from third shot, so the hit 5-iron from second.
And then 78 meters to the hole.  It was good.  But just little (indiscernible) ball.
Q. And then the putt?  It was like 15 feet.
IN GEE CHUN: 17, it was very tricky putt, on the tricky lie.  It was a little double break.  I honestly felt like little miss hole, like going right, but stay straight.
Got lucky.
Q. Last one:  You're in a good position going into tomorrow.  What's your approach going to be?
IN GEE CHUN: My goal is always enjoy my game, so I try enjoy my game.
Then because I miss some -- my putt was not really good this week, but if I try more enjoy my game it's getting more chance tomorrow.  Stay patient.
