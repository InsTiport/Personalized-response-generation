 Q.  How was your day today?  
IN GEE CHUN: Was good.  It was very windy today, so I try make bogey-free round but I had one bogey on 17.   
But it's good because before the start I think about make bogey-free round, because if I make a bogey-free round I can get one ice cream.   
Just no ice cream today.  I will try tomorrow.   
 Q.  What happened on 17?  
IN GEE CHUN: Big bounce to the left so ball was little tricky lie; behind the ball very soft and then little hole there, so I tried chip shot but it was short.   
Was good.  Putt was good, but little short.   
 Q.  One shot back from the lead.  What do you do tomorrow to get yourself in good position?  
IN GEE CHUN: I will try to keep going and then where I am see later.   
 Q.  What do you hope to accomplish tomorrow?  
IN GEE CHUN: I think windy is again tomorrow, so I will try enjoy with the windy and all the good Canadian people, all the good spectators here.  Yeah.
