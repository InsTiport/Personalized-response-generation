  MIGUEL ANGEL MARTIN:   It's more than lovely I think.   For me, it's unbelievable, perfect.   I'm playing good and I putt so good.  
   
 Q.   What made the difference today, as opposed to the other two days?  
MIGUEL ANGEL MARTIN:   Well, the wind has dropped quite a bit in the morning and now it's picking up a little bit more.   But I putt so good, that's the main thing.  
   
 Q.   And of course being right down the bottom, you're nicely into place.   
MIGUEL ANGEL MARTIN:   Well, looks like I'm going to jump a lot of spots, so I look for tomorrow to play similar and see what's happening.   
   
 Q.   Have you seen what the weather forecast is, because this round could be even better if the bad stuff comes in.   
MIGUEL ANGEL MARTIN:   I didn't see it, so the weather is coming bad this afternoon.   I'm sorry for the guys playing, but that's the golf.  
   
 Q.   You splashed out of that bunker superbly well.   
MIGUEL ANGEL MARTIN:   I tell you what, that bunker is tough because there's not much sun on it.   So I know I can hit it a little bit skinny and I can go past the hole.   But I did really, really good.   And the third, to leave it so close, because I was a little bit nervous on the last hole.  
   
 Q.   And especially after a day like that, you wouldn't want it to go bad at the end.   
MIGUEL ANGEL MARTIN:   No, I don't want to make bogey at the last one, no.
