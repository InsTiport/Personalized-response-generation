 Q.  What did you learn on the LPGA in your rookie year to help get you to this point?  
MUNI HE: A lot. I think I had a lot to learn. I had a really rough like first half of the year, but it was good because I learned what was the best for me in terms of practicing and playing and competing on another level.   
So, yeah, I'm glad I went through a rough patch.   
 Q.  What would you say is the biggest learning experience here so far?  
MUNI HE: At Q-School?   
 Q.  Yeah, or Q-Series.  
MUNI HE: Q-Series, right. I think it's just to stay patient because there are eight rounds. After making mistakes, knowing that you have a lot more holes to make up for it is important.   
 Q.  7-under. Have to be pretty confident.  
MUNI HE: Yeah, I think I feel pretty -- wouldn't say like confident-confident, because golf anything can happen -- but I feel comfortable. Yeah, more comfortable than last year, that's for sure.   
 Q.  What's the biggest thing you have to make sure you do to maybe reach that confidence point?  
MUNI HE: Making sure that physically and mentally I'm just consistent and no drastic changes in terms of anything really, yeah.
