 Q.  How did it go? Good?  
MUNI HE: Yeah. Pretty good. I think score is good, yeah.   
 Q.  You won on Symetra last year. How much of a winner's mentality does it take out here to push through and get into especially that top 20 group?  
MUNI HE: Right. I think mentally it's pretty similar, but because we're here for two weeks instead of just four rounds, it was very important for me to keep on reminding myself like, Hey, be patient and pace yourself; we have so much golf left.   
 Q.  Is that something you maybe turn on come Wednesday? Change the course of how you think about things with where you are?  
MUNI HE: I think so, because unfortunately when we start to play poorly we tend to - at least for me - I think I tend to rush things and feel like I'm running out of time.   
With eight rounds it's a little bit easier to keep that in mind, yeah.
