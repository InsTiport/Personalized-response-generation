Q. After an incredible 7-under day here in the fifth round of Q-Series, what was it about No. 9 today that just lit a fire under you?
MUNI HE: I have no idea. I think the course condition was playing a lot better than I thought it would be.
It's very suitable for me. The greens are very receptive and the fairways are pretty good still, so it still runs out.
Yeah, it was just a good day in general. Very consistent.
Q. What has this experience been like for and you what has it been like dealing with the mentality and the pressure and then being able to turn a round around like today?
MUNI HE: It's been really great. This year, my rookie year, it's been a little challenging to start off with. I think I'm finally getting the hang of things.
It's been a lot better for me mentally and in terms of my game, too. I think I've just grown and learned so much throughout this year that I feel pretty confident right now just within myself and my own game.
I know that even if I have a bad day, it's okay because it's just golf. I'm more accepting of my mistakes, yeah.
Q. I was going to say, as a 2019 rookie on the LPGA Tour, what did you learn about maybe the professional aspect of this game?
MUNI HE: I think I've learned that golf is a very, very individualized sport, so it can be different for everyone. What might work for you might not work for someone else and vice versa.
So it was very important to find something that worked for me in terms of practicing and playing and competing, and now I feel like I kind of have it a little bit more figured out. Yeah.
