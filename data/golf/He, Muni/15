 Q.  What are your general thoughts on today's round?  MUNI HE: I had a pretty good start to start with, then I -- overall, I don't think I played too badly.  There was a par-3 which I doubled, No. 11, I believe, that was due to the wrong club choice.  Other than that, I think I had two 3-putts which were a speed control problem. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the way I played.  I think I did better than yesterday other than how my game felt.  I feel pretty confident with my game.  Just had some bad breaks. These greens are pretty fast, especially downhill.   Q.  Did you notice a big difference between today and yesterday?  MUNI HE: Yes, for sure.  The pins are definitely in harder locations, more sloped, more tilted and just harder spots in general.  You really can't be above the hole because it's going to be super fast doing down.   Q.  How do you feel going into tomorrow?  MUNI HE: I'm just happy to be here.  And playing with Paula, that was really fun.  Just going to try my best and see what can happen
