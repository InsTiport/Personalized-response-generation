Q. Sum up your round today.
MUNI HE: I think today's round, it started off really good and I came in pretty nervous, but I think at the beginning I was having a really good front nine and the back nine I think maybe the heat just got to me a little bit and I had three pretty rough holes.
But I'm really glad I kind of held in there and finished with a good ending I think to the day.
Q. A year after you played here last year, you come back as a member of the LPGA Tour and you won on the Symetra Tour.  What does it mean to you?
MUNI HE: I think other my scores here last year weren't very good at all, but I think it was a very lucky start for me to the year.  I think it brought a lot of good luck to me.
You know, I really wanted to come back to Thailand again this year to see how much I've improved myself.  I've been working really, really hard, and I know my game has improved a little bit.
So it's been really fun, and I'm really honored to have the opportunity to be able to come back and replay this course.
Q. Are you surprised that you have so many fans in Thailand?
MUNI HE: I totally am, but it's so great, so amazing being able to interact with the fans here and on social media as well.
I just want to say like thank you so much to all the fans here in Thailand.  It really means a lot to me.
Q. Is there anything that you would like to do or eat especially in Thailand?
MUNI HE: I love anything spicy, as I've always mentioned.  The little red chile peppers here, it's really delicious and I add it to everything.
