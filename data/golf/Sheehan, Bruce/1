 Q. Talk about the course if you would first today. 
 BRUCE SHEEHAN: It was pretty wet. The greens actually weren't too bad. The greens held up pretty well. But everything else was an absolute swamp out there. It's too bad. 

 Q. Do you want to just give an overview of your day?
 BRUCE SHEEHAN: My day wasn't -- it was good to start with, I birdied my first holed, bogeyed my second hole, birdied my third hole and then the rains came and after the three hour delay I wasn't very good.
