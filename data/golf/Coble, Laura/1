Q. You got up quickly.
LAURA COBLE: I was very fortunate.  You know, I mean, when it gets down this far you got to take advantage of the other person's mistakes.
You don't hope they make mistakes, but if they do, you got to take advantage and do what you can to stay on top of it.  5-up is never enough.  You know what I mean?
Q. You won the first three holes of the match.
LAURA COBLE: Yeah.
Q. How much of a comfort zone is that?
LAURA COBLE: It was good, but I'm not comfortable.  I just wanted more.  Not sound greedy, but I just honestly I told my caddie, Pete, 5-up is not enough.
So I know Kim is a great player and she can come back and she's not ever going to give up.  I knew I needed to keep plugging along.  And we did.  We didn't make quite as many putts as we wanted, but it was okay.  It's all right.
Q. Thoughts on moving ahead to the semifinals?  I think this is, what, the third time you've been to the semis of a USGA event?
LAURA COBLE: I think '12 I might have been in the semis with Megan at Briggs Ranch.
Q. Yeah.
LAURA COBLE: That sounds about right.  Sounds about right.
Q. The experience factor?
LAURA COBLE: Absolutely.  I mean, it does help.  You can draw on -- I mean, just the experience this week on the golf course.  I've hit so many shots around here.  Now I'm just drawing on those memories when I stand on the tee or have a certain angle.
And then just the overall experience of the USGA.  You know what's it's going to be.  You're going to be nervous.  It's okay.  You know it's just plodding on and just keep your head down and keep going.
Q. Going to do anything between rounds here?
LAURA COBLE: Just relax.  Take my shoes off, eat, unwind for a little bit, and chill out.
Q. Yeah.  Could be Ellen.
LAURA COBLE: Yeah, it's great.  It's awesome.  I love it.  I haven't played her in a match in quite a while.
Q. I think '09 Mid.
LAURA COBLE: Really.  Is it?  Long time.
Q. I think you played Kim and then you played Ellen back to back at the '09 Mid.
LAURA COBLE: How about that.  You got a great memory.
Q. No.  We looked that up.  Come on.
LAURA COBLE: Yeah, you should just say, Yeah, I remembered that and just let me think that you did.
