Q. Good run.  Tough way to lose though in the semifinals.
LAURA COBLE: Yeah.
Q. How do you feel?
LAURA COBLE: Disappointed.
Q. Yeah.  How long was the putt on the 19th hole?
LAURA COBLE: Probably a good five feet maybe.
Q. Did you misread it or miss-strike it?
LAURA COBLE: Just miss-struck it, yeah.  Just didn't quite hit it hard enough.
Q. How does it feel to take a 6-time USGA champion to 19 holes in that match?
LAURA COBLE: Well, thank you for saying that.  It was good.  She just hung around and hung around, and I could not get the putts to drop today like they were the rest of the week for me.
And that's just what she does.  She's going to hang around until you close the door.
Q. How much help was Peter on your bag?
LAURA COBLE: He was great.  He was tremendous.  Really good.  He knows the greens and we were just very much in sync with what we were thinking and feeling on shots and putts and all.
He was a big help.
Q. How tough was the putt that Ellen made on the 15th hole?
LAURA COBLE: It was a 10 out of 1 out of 10.  I mean, you've been out there every day to watch?
Q. Yeah.
LAURA COBLE: It's just a brutal green.  Brutal.
Q. Almost made like a 90-degree turn out there.
LAURA COBLE: I mean, that green is crazy.  What can you say?
Q. Sure.  It's hard when your opponent makes putts like that, right?
LAURA COBLE: I mean, hats off to her.  It was a great putt, no doubt.
