Q. Not the finish you wanted, but can you give us an assessment of your day?
TRISH JOHNSON: Yeah, pretty ordinary, really.  Hit a great drive off the first and that was the best shot I hit all day.  Really didn't play particularly well, didn't putt particularly well.  It was a weird sort of day really.  Neither of us played particularly well.  I had a chance, I suppose, on 10, 11, 12.  I had a putt on 12 which was a pretty straight putt, 10 foot up the hill to sort of take the lead.  Just didn't hit it hard enough, and it died off, and that was pretty much it.  A poor shot into the next, poor drive at the next.  Good birdie at 15, decent shot at 16, and then a total -- I can't say that live, a total idiotic mistake on 17.  My ball was close to Alfie's marker, felt a bit uncomfortable, should have just got her to move the marker and not worry about it, and yeah, I missed a little slider.  Yeah, pretty disappointing.  But she deserved to win.  She played the best.
Q. The way she played down the stretch, put a little bit more pressure on you to try to produce shots?
TRISH JOHNSON: No, not really.  It wasn't -- she kept making putts that I would have had her to eventually miss, and she didn't miss one, and that's very impressive because it doesn't matter how you do it, you get the ball in the hole, and she did.  I'm sure there's lots of the same stories.  You've got to hole the putts, and neither of us played particularly well, she just played better than me.
