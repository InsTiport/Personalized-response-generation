Q. So all the familiar names from last year got back in the mix of it today.  What was different today than yesterday?
TRISH JOHNSON: Nothing really, to be fair.  The course was possibly playing a little bit easier, pins were a little bit easier than yesterday.  No, I mean, not being funny, you expect the people that play full time, if you like, to be in the mix, if they are, and Alfie obviously doesn't play full-time, but she's still a top-class player.  There's a lot of golf to be played.  But yeah, you caught me at a pretty disappointing finish, so probably not in the best of spirits.  But there's two days to go, and I can't putt or chip any worse than that, so it can only get better.
Q. Do you think that the weekend will be -- par is going to be a good score on the weekend?
TRISH JOHNSON: Very much depends.  Depends if they water the greens, where they put the pins.  What's leading?  2-over.  I mean, if Alfie shoots level par, possibly, but I think you've got to get back to par, I think, to win.  That will be the aim.
Q. That's what Laura was saying her goal is is to get back to level.
TRISH JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I was 1-under today with three to play, and make another birdie I'm back to -- yeah, that's what you're sort of aiming for.  At 5-over, that's a long way off, but as I said, my short game can only be better, it can't be any worse.
