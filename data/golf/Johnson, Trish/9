TRISH JOHNSON:  I got off to a good start.  I had a few chances, disappointing to say the least, but you have to remember, they want to win desperately.
Q.  As much as has been said about home advantage, and this crowd is hollering USA, USA.

How difficult is it to play in that atmosphere?
TRISH JOHNSON:  The crowd has been great, they really have, it's been very fair.  I think the hardest thing for us is the golf course.  I think that's why, we're not used to having this type of course.  That's the hardest thing.  It's going to happen sooner or later, as Catrin said earlier.  It doesn't seem like it's going to be this time, but it will happen sooner or later.
Q.  Okay.  Get out there and cheer on your team.
TRISH JOHNSON:  Thank you.
