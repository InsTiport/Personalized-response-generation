Q.   Finishing with a round like that, how does that make you feel? 
ZACH JOHNSON:   My short game carried me the last three holes, four holes maybe even.   Stick with the ball on the fairway when I needed to the last five or six holes, and I got to 1â€‘under for the day, and then the double on 5, but, obviously, a nice gift on 9.

Q.   We were watching you.   Was it sand on the green you tried to use a towel? 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, just some sand.

Q.   Talk about the process.   Do you have to be careful sometimes to make sure the sand is off the green for example?   Is that pretty normal? 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, I mean, we know we can't.   That wasn't close to the fringe.   You can't touch sand on the fringe.
