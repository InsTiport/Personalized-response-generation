Q. Got off to a big lead and then seemed like really was just trying to hold on.
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, quite honestly I had one bad hole.  He had a bad hole that 15th, but I had a worse one.
I told Jason, You can put me down for an 11, but with my handicap I think I made a 7.
All in all I played really solid.  I missed about four-and-a-half, five-footer on 12 for par.  Other than that I didn't give much.  I just hit it in the fairway.  Played my boring golf.  I was a few under probably, and then had an x on that hole, on 15.
So just really solid, you know.  There was a couple times there where I could have got astray and I made a nice four- or five-footer for par.
All in all it was a pretty solid day considering the conditions.
Q. Your boring golf also produced an undefeated record this week.  You've got to feel pretty good about that.
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, well, I feel great about that.
What did you say?
Q. I asked about your undefeated record.
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, well, I feel great about that.  You know, singles is one thing because it's just you and your man, your caddie.  Pairing up with Phil this week was just a joy.  We were a great tandem, and I felt like we played okay golf.  We could have played better.
Yeah, I feel great about my round.  My job coming in here was to make points, and for the most part I did an okay job of that.
Q. I would say you did better than okay.  Caps off a pretty good year for you.
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, ready for an off season, and I'm going to take some time off.  I am going to enjoy it, relish it.
But any time you beat an athlete, a professional, and a classy guy like Jason, feels very good.  At the same time he's a really good friend, and that part feels bad.
But that's sports.  He's had the best of me many, many times.  He's a great friend.  I feel really honored to get a point for our team.
