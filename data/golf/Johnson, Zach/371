Q.  You were put on the spot to answer; what was your view?
ZACH JOHNSON:  I was the one that made the putts and made the shots, but it's not all about    I was able to, you know, be aggressive at times because Scott had par or what have you.  It was a team effort, regardless of what anybody says.  I know he didn't play that great.  Fortunately I did, but that's the way it goes.

You know, I was seeing the lines pretty well, and fortunately hitting down the line.
Q.  In that last chip to end it, happy to end it there rather than go to 18?
ZACH JOHNSON:  No question.  Plus, I could be a little aggressive.  He had 25 feet straight up the hill.  So we were in a good position.  Captain said, "You know what, they have chipped in some, it's your turn," so I did.
Q.  You have the distinction of having a lot of birdies this week and I guess that's a good sign and momentum for this afternoon.
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, I made a lot.  I don't know how many I made.  But fortunately they are going in.

Yesterday, I mean, honestly, I played good the last three holes.  Chad hung me in there to those last three and those three gave me some confidence for today.
Q.  On the front side, did you feel you had the momentum going into the back side today?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Winning like that was nice, that helped, and then obviously making that putt on 10 kind of put us in a comfort zone.  We were able to be conservatively aggressive I guess you could say.
