 Q.   Nice round of golf for you.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Thanks, yeah.   It was pretty solid.   I hit it nice today.   I never made any massive mistakes with my ball‑striking.   I really didn't putt that well, which is good, I guess.   I mean, I had a couple nice three‑ to six‑footers, but nothing significant.   I missed a couple putts, and I guess it's encouraging when you can put 3 onto the card.  
   
 Q.   I was watching the ball and it was turning over right.   You putted fine, some just didn't go in, like at the 9th.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, that was a misread, and you're going to have those.   I feel like I'm hitting it okay, it's certainly solid.   I've just got to get maybe a little bit more consistent read and then obviously strike them a little bit better.
