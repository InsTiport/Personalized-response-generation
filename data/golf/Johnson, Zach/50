ZACH JOHNSON: I'm so happy for the guys that have played the last three or four, four or five Ryder Cups, much like myself, and more than that, I'm ecstatic for Davis.  I mean, he's a consummate professional and one of my best friends.  And he didn't want us to win it for him.  That's not really why I played, but this one feels like it's for him and Robin.
All that, I mean, I felt great out there today.  The Lord gave me peace.  One foot after the other.
I didn't give him anything.  I think I putted one par putt, it was like three feet.  It was a solid day.
That kid's really good.  I mean, great thing for golf is that he is young.  The great thing for Europe is that he's young and the bad thing for us is that he's young, because he's going to be a great player one of these days.
Q. You are a great player now.  Can you compare this to the rest of your career?
ZACH JOHNSON: It's completely different.  If there was anything lacking on my rÃ©sumÃ©, if you want to give it that.  I'm not a numbers guy, stat guy, but that was it.  As a lot of the elders on the team would say, this is just the beginning.  I'm not suggesting it's going to be like this every two years, but we've got a great thing going.  We've got a good game plan.  This is just one of those weeks where it came in.  Fortunately it came to fruition.
This one is for all the fans, too.  This Minnesota fan crowd is spectacular.  I tip my hat to them.
