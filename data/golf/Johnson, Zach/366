  Q.  How was the course playing?   
 ZACH JOHNSON:  I'm just happy to be playing.  This is one day.  I'm just happy to be in 1-under on this golf course.  I feel good, but today is just one day.  And this day is not close to being done.   
 It doesn't matter what day of the week it is, I've won when I've led after the first, second, and third rounds, but I've also fallen flat on my tush in the same situation.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the first hole.   
 ZACH JOHNSON:  It was hard.  I had a high fade from an uphill lie around the tree, landed on and rolled over.  It was a mediocre chip to 12 feet.  I hit a good putt, but I hit a spike mark.  I never used that excuse, but it hit a spike mark.   
  
  Q.  Regarding attitude.   
 ZACH JOHNSON:  My outlook is all about perspective.  You have to be patient.  Wait out there for the good things to happen.  Remain patient and trust what you're doing.
