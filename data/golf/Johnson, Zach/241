  Q. A couple comments about the conditions today.   
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, it's unfortunate. You'd like to see it even out as far as conditions go with the whole field, but it's just the luck of the draw or unluck side of the draw, depending on how you look at it. But all in all, it's just tough tee 1 to 18 green, regardless of what's going on.   
 It was just really tough for about, well, a good solid nine holes for me.  
  
  Q. So 1-over par is decent, a good round, considering those conditions?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, thanks, it's decent. I had one bad hole and a three-putt from like 20 feet. Other than that, it was really solid. I actually had some birdie opportunities and managed to make a couple but nothing significant. I'm not too upset. I never took myself out of the hole. You know, got a long day tomorrow.  
  
  Q. How many towels, gloves, did you guys go through?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Well, I used the wet gloves early on in the round, and that helps, I think. First time I've done that. FootJoy, whatever they're called, rain gloves, and they were terrific. No slipping. As a matter of fact the wetter they got, the better they performed. I just went through one glove.  
  
  Q. How many towels?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: I can't count that high.
