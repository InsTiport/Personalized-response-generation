 Q.   Zach, 2‑under par today.   Give us some comments on your round?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, it was good.   I mean, today was a ball striking day.   I putted very average.   I made two long putts coming down the stretch, but I hit 16 of the 18 greens.   I hit 11 of 14 fairways.   
It was just a really, really solid day.   I think two of the fairways I missed were intermediate cut that essentially cost me nothing.   It was just really, really good tee to green, and okay on the greens.   So I'm encouraged about the rest of the week.  
   
 Q.   Do you like your chances?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, it's only Thursday.   I have no idea.   I think that the chance‑‑ the nice thing is, one, I made the cut.   And two, I'll probably finish in the top 30.
