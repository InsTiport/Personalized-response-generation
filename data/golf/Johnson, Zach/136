 Q.   Now that you've heard more about Dustin, any reaction, any contact?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   No.  
   
 Q.   What was your thought just hearing about that story, that the suspension was for cocaine?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   I haven't read it.  
   
 Q.   A sixâ€‘month suspension for cocaine, according to Golf.com.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Is that according to the PGA Tour?  
   
 Q.   In fact, the PGA Tour says he wasn't suspended at all.   The fact that there are two different stories, what do you make of that?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   I make of that the media.  
   
 Q.   So in other words, you think he's not suspended at all.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   I don't have an opinion on it.   I don't know the facts.   But the media has an opinion.  
   
 Q.   Golf.com certainly has an opinion.   What do you think of the policy, Zach, about the Tour not announcing disciplinary measures if there are some?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   I'm a pretty conservative guy.   Policy is policy.  
   
 Q.   So you're okay with that?   You don't think they need to be more transparent with the people that follow the game?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   I haven't given it any thought.
