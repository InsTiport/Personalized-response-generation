 Q.  Regarding being on the leaderboard. 

 ZACH JOHNSON:  I knew I was close... I knew it didn't matter-it's Friday. 

 Q.  Regarding finishing with three bogeys. 

 ZACH JOHNSON:  I think I hit only one bad shot the last three holes.  I hit some really good putts... all in all I'm very content with where I'm at. 

 I'm putting really well.  I'm reading the greens well and I feel good over the putts. 

 I 3-putted No. 16.  On the first putt I think the wind affected it and the second one hit a spike mark... it's just the greens.  Par are par I guess I got  "Augustacized". 

 It's an honor to play at the Masters and it's an honor to play the Ryder Cup... 

 Q.  What happened on your bunker shot on number 18 when you left it in? 

 ZACH JOHNSON:  I was trying to get close and I just misjudged it.  The second one I hit well. 

 Q.  Regarding the weekend. 

 ZACH JOHNSON:  Patience is of the utmost importance.  It is just golf.  At Augusta you don't try to make putts, you lag them.  It is a difficult test, which is good.  I had a lot more positive is than negatives.  I feel pretty good.  I hit a lot of good shots the last three holes.
