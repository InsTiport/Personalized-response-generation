Q.
7-under on the day.  Talk a little bit about your round.
ZACH JOHNSON:  Today was a day where I got off to a good start, got a little confidence going early and was able just to maintain it from the getgo, so my putter was working and I was hitting fairways and greens.
Q.  How are the conditions out there, pretty consistent all day?
ZACH JOHNSON:  I'd say they were pretty consistent.

I mean, we're getting mud on our balls.  That kind of played havoc with me on the last hole and a couple other holes.  The wind switched halfway through our round, not too much but a little bit.  All in all, I think the course is playing great.
