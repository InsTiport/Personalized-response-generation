Q.  Talk about going out this afternoon.
ZACH JOHNSON:  I didn't really care who we were playing, I mean, I'm excited Chad and I are going out.  We're excited to get out there and start competing.  It's kind of frustrating sitting on the bench, but, you know, it's a team game and that's the way it goes.
Q.  What have you been doing earlier, just cheering?
ZACH JOHNSON:  I practiced a little bit, cheered a little bit, ate a lot.  So ready to go.
Q.  Have you played with Chad before?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, quite a bit, absolutely.  We're just going to relish this opportunity and really look back to our Hooters Tour days    just kidding.
