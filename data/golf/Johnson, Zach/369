Q.  Could be a huge point in the context of these matches.  Did you fancy that one standing behind it?

ZACH JOHNSON:  I had a good read.  Scott said it was right center and I didn't really see it until he said it.  I just got up there and hit it.  I figured I'd give it a run because he's got 20 feet up the hill.  It finally went in.
Q.  It's always a little bit difficult, isn't it, Scott, when you look as though you're going well in the match and suddenly they pull one back and you're only 1 up.  What were you feeling at that stage?

SCOTT VERPLANK:  I was fine.  I think Zach was, too.  We just    honestly, as an individual I didn't play very good until the last couple holes.  There in the last couple holes I started hitting some better shots to try and help him out and make sure we could win this match.  He didn't need much help today.  He was all world.  We were just thinking hit it in the fairway, hit it on the green, make a birdie.
