 Q.   Just not the Sunday you had hoped for but a good week overall.   Just without like of a better question, just some comments on the week.  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah.   I mean good week.   Feel like you can push the rewind on my weeks lately.   More positives than negatives and just not getting it done when I need to get it done, I guess.   
But, way, way, way more positives than negatives.   I mean overall, I feel like the direction my game is right now is terrific.   I just got to make some more putts.   I'm hitting the ball fine.   Probably driving the ball as good as I can drive it consistently week-in, week-out.   So, it's just a matter of making a couple more putts and executing a little bit better.
