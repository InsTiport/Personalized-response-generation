Q.   Before we came on camera, Zach came over kind of bent over, took a deep sigh of relief and said, "I'm exhausted." Is it more mentally exhausting or physically?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yes.   I had 25 holes, so obviously you have physical fatigue there.   I mean, 25 is probably not a big deal, but with the gusts, I'm assuming 35 to 40, I don't know what we experienced, it was very difficult. 
Today was a grab‑your‑lunch‑pail‑and‑go‑to‑work kind of day but it was a grinding day.   I don't mind it.   I felt like I was playing The Open Championship to some degree.   Not the way I wanted to end my day but I didn't play that bad. 

Q.   What was it like out there as you made your way around point to point?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Just hard.   I recall hitting great shots and then 3‑putting.   You can miss a 3‑footer just because of the wind.   I remember two par 5s, I hit four really good shots and tapped in for a 5. 
It was a day of patience and just trying to grind it out.   It was a day of really controlling your business, you know.   That's not the way you want to play the game but you essentially have to play the game that way and avoid the big, big mistake.   To date I've only got a bogey, so I've avoided those doubles fortunately.
There's a couple holes that even with this wind that you feel like you can still make a birdie, but once again, eliminating the big mistakes and trying to get this golf course in front of you is very difficult.
