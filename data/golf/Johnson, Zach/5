Q. If you'd just let us know how the scoring conditions compared this week to 10 years ago when you said the scoring record at this tournament, and would you be surprised if that got broken?
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, there are some similarities. I would say -- what year was that, 2010? I would say in 2010 -- like yesterday we had some wind that you had to manage, and I think today there was even less wind, and maybe more humid, a little drier. But as far as the way the course is playing, how receptive the greens are, et cetera, et cetera, there's a lot of parallels.
It wouldn't surprise me. If conditions stay like this, with how the winds are supposed to be, especially in the morning, it wouldn't surprise me.
