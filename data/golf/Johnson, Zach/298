  Q. Unbelievable drama out there today, and I take it you're very pleased with the way you performed?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yes, thanks. It was unbelievable drama. I mean, I tried to stay in my own world, and for the most part I did that. I played my ball. It's kind of hard when you're seeing what you're seeing. Obviously Tiger when he needs to step up, he does it. It was impressive to watch. But yes, nonetheless, I feel great about my game.  
  
  Q. What was it about today the way you played that you were particularly happy with?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Well, I made two bogeys today, and actually hit pretty good shots, especially on the first one. So all in all, I had opportunities. My rhythm was good today, I was happy about that, and I stuck to my game. It was tough. I mean, I don't know what I shot today, even, 1-under, I don't know, but all in all, I thought I did a good job of taking myself out of the picture and playing my own game.  
  
  Q. Safe to say that your game is peaking at the right time?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Quite honestly it's been good for the whole year. I got sick about five weeks ago, and I think I'm really now starting to get healthy. I was really sick at Doral and Tampa and probably shouldn't have played, but I forced myself to play. All in all, you'd like to peak every week, but I'm excited for a week off, and I'm looking forward to Augusta.
