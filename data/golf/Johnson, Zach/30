Q. What pleased you most about your playing?
ZACH JOHNSON: I'm probably just going to say the consistency.  I'm hitting a lot of fairways, hitting a lot of greens, giving myself opportunities, making a couple, for the most part taking a pretty good advantage of the par-5s, which is key.  But all in all just solid.  I don't want to call it boring golf, but kind of boring golf.
Q. Your putt on 18 here.  Crucial to hole these putts.  How good is this?
ZACH JOHNSON: The blade feels good right now, I put a lot of work into it because that's probably been the one part of my game that hasn't been up to par.  But that was a bonus.  That was all of 25, 30 feet there.  So a nice gift to go make my turn.
Q. How pleased were you with the second shot here?
ZACH JOHNSON: Sure, my caddie gave me the wrong club and right here I opened the blade a little bit, trying to get it into a five foot radius and I was just fortunate it dropped.
Q. Did the caddie really give you the wrong club?  He's a.  Brilliant caddie?
ZACH JOHNSON: Well I hit the shot, right, so I can never blame him.  I'm just messing with him.  But I was committed to that club, it was just evidently the wrong one.
Q. You were quoted last week that you feel like your best golf might be ahead of you.
ZACH JOHNSON: Well I've seen the numbers, I'm kind of a stat guy, because they don't lie, it's facts, and I'm seeing some things that I've never really seen before in my game that's encouraging.  And then more so than that I think we have really kind of gone back to the roots of my game and my practice preparation time, both off weeks and on weeks, what I want to focus on.  It's not a matter of more or less, it's just a matter of efficiency.  So I like everything about that preparation.  And I saw some good things last fall.  That was part of it.  I saw some major positives that led into January so far.
