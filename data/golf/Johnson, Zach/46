Q. Tomorrow you are playing Brendan Steele, you've got one and a half points, you beat him, you get two points.  Tommy Fleetwood gets two points, it's still a lot to play for?
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, there's a lot going on.  I take care of business tomorrow and it looks like I have a chance.  That's all you can ask for, especially after a loss the first match.  But a lot of work.  Steely is playing great.  And again, he's playing good.  It's the way it goes.
Q. You've got a job to do.
ZACH JOHNSON: That's right, I've got a job to do.  As my daughter says, I've got to go on the golf course and make it worth it.
Q. Is this golf course a Johnson golf course?
ZACH JOHNSON: I don't know.  If I play good, I don't think it really matters where we play.  I think I can play well here.  I have in the past.  I did last year.  Yeah, given the way -- given certain winds and certain shots, I enjoy it.  I think it's a very good test.  I think as we've seen, it doesn't fit a guy that necessarily bombs it or kills it.  That's a beautiful golf course.
Q. Tomorrow this is fun, everyone is going to be tuning in to see what happens.
ZACH JOHNSON: There are a lot of variables, a lot of fluctuation, and it should be fun.
