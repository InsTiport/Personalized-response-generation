Q.   Bogey early on the card but you fought back well today?
ZACH JOHNSON:   It was a little rough early.   I hit some good shots, made a bogey on 3.   Tee shot was great, into a divot.   Made about   ‑‑   it was basically exactly what happened.   I turned it around nicely.   Hit some quality shots and gave myself a number of opportunities.

Q.   Birdies today for you that stand out? 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, I birdied some of the par 5s, and hit a nice shot on 9, 6‑iron to about eight feet and made that, which was a tucked pin, back left pin. 
I birdied 13, the par3, which is like gaining a shot.   So quality shot there to about seven, eight feet.   Those two really stick out for me.
