  Q.  The U.S. side, five in a row --   
 ZACH JOHNSON:  It's just a matter of getting some momentum and that's the beauty of team match play.   
  
  Q.  You're going to go out this afternoon and Tiger and you get the afternoon off, are you looking forward to more action?   
 DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, I am.  Zach and I had a great time this morning.  He played really well, gave a couple back on the back nine and they had the momentum until we chipped in on 15.  It was a good day and I knew our team was playing well.  It was a lot quieter out here today and we can feed off that and it was nice to get a point.   
  
  Q.  Zach, chipping in on 15, that's what it took?   
 DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, we had all the momentum early through ten holes and we gave one back at 11 and they birdied 12 and chipped in at 14.  So we needed something good to happen, and we did that and we just played solid holes after that and put pressure on them.   
  
  Q.  How much fun did you have playing out there?  You looked real relaxed with each other?   
 ZACH JOHNSON:  It's the first time we played together but I hope it's not the last.  David is easy going, good rhythm, and especially when he's playing as solid as he is, no flaws.  I just tried to get it up around the green as you witnessed on 15.   
 It was fun.  We did feed off each other, especially on the front nine, let a couple slide, but we came back when we needed to, and it feels good to get a W.
