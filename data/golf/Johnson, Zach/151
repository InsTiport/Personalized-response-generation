 Q.   You know what this tournament means, you got to go low.   I know you got off to a little bit of a slow start.   When that happens, what are you starting to think in your mind when you got to the third and you say, well, I got to get this thing going.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, I would like to start over, but I mean this is a tournament of patience.   There's so many opportunities for birdies out there, that you just have to, whether it's a bogey or a missed opportunity with a birdie, you just got to remain patient.   And I've certainly stuck to what I'm trying to do, because you'll have more opportunities if you hit quality shots.   And fortunately, I righted the ship a little bit and turned my round around.   You always feel like you left something out there though.  
   
 Q.   We know what the lead is, we know how low some guys are going, how difficult can it be sometimes to not think about that when you still got to go out on the golf course tomorrow?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well essentially you got to assume the scoreboard's irrelevant.   Just get to the tee, play that hole for what it is.   That's all you can do.   You know guys are going to make birdies.   That's a given there.   Especially with conditions like this.   I mean we were trying to do our best, but everybody has to play, everybody's playing every hole just the same, the same pin placements.   So you take advantage of the parâ€‘5s here, you can do some good work.
