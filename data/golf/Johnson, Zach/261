 Q. Talk about your birdies and bogeys for the folks that didn't see your round. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Birdies and bogeys, I started on the back nine. I hit a sand wedge on 11 to about probably seven feet. Managed to make that. 
 13, I hit a good 5-wood off the tee and hit a lob wedge straight downwind about 113 yards to about six feet. I made that one. 
 15, I made a bogey, pushed my tee shot one step in the rough there. I hit a great shot out of there with a wood and then hit a pretty good chip, but just slid by the hall to about six, seven feet and missed that putt for par.
