 Q.   First loss together as a team, tell us about the day, a few bogeys, a couple birdies, just tell us about today.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   We played better this morning than we did yesterday.   You know, a couple missed opportunities yesterday and just put each other in some difficult predicaments.   Especially when we had a few opportunities there.   And they capitalized.   You just can't do that in this tournament.   
   
 Q.   So this morning, were there any issues this morning?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   No, it was pleasant.   Just yeah, the golf course is wet, but considering the amount of rain, it's drained pretty good.
