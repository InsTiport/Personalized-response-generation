 Q.  1-under 70 in the second round.  How does the course play different today besides obviously the rain?  ZACH JOHNSON: Completely different.  Not any roll.  Greens were holding.  I mean, that was the positives. Just very difficult.  Hit a couple good shots off the tee.  Like hitting a water ball, even if your face was dry at address.  It's just one of those you have to be patient and persevere, take the cuts when you can. Not an easy day.  I mean, it was just very difficult, as a whole.   Q.  A lot of players thought the greens were slow yesterday.  Obviously they slowed down today.  Did that help or hurt?  ZACH JOHNSON: Well, I mean, yeah, they certainly weren't fast, but, I mean, they're wet and they're holding.  I don't think it's any secret.  Nor do I think it was, you know, anything that we were blindsided.  It's normal for this type of weather.   Q.  How do you feel the course will hold up the last two days?  ZACH JOHNSON: I mean, it depends upon the forecast.  Depends upon how much more rain we have. There's plenty of holes out there.  If you hit the ball down the middle of the fairway, you might be in casual water, might be in the rough.  It's going to depend on drainage.  It's going to depend upon, you know, if we get any more rain.  Obviously wind, too.  It's not blowing that hard. I mean, the course is fine.  Regardless of what happens from here on out, I think it will be all right.  We just need that rain gone.
