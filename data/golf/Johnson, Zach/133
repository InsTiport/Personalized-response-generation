Q. Was there ever a chance for an opening on this neck and neck all day?ZACH JOHNSON: Man, I tell you what, we just played great.  We put the ball in the fairway for the most part, gave ourselves a lot of good lucks, couple of missed puts, couple of great opportunities that we didn't capitalize.  They made a lot of nice putts, long putts.  That was really what took it.Q. Is that the strongest part of their game?ZACH JOHNSON: I don't know.  They both hit it great and they both putted great.  I don't know if you can say one aspect is stronger than the next, but they definitely putted great today.Q. You guys kept it in the fairway most of the time?ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, we did.  With the exception of maybe one tee shot early and one tee shot late, we did.Q. I noticed up to 11, it was pretty darn tough?ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, exactly.  They got off to a good start.  We came back.  They kind of pecked at it, we came back.  We just didn't have enough at the end
