Q. Well, it's a gorgeous fall Saturday in Winged Foot, throw in a 68 with an eagle and par on the back side, couldn't get much better than that.
ZACH JOHNSON:   No, I mean -- I'd like to say I left a few out there, but I made my share too.  Other than a missed four foot putt, I mean, I made some putts too.  I cannot complain.  It was solid.  I kept the golf course in front of me and hit a lot more fairways today thankfully.
Now, granted the wind's kind of calmed down.  It feels like I should be tailgating right now.
Q. You will be in just over a month.
ZACH JOHNSON:   We'll see.
Q. Hopefully.  Fingers crossed.  What do you think of the setup so far through 54 holes?
ZACH JOHNSON:   This is one of those courses, it was pretty immediate when I came back here this past weekend in the sense -- immediate in the sense that what you see is what you get.  It's right out in front of you.  There's nothing manipulated or contrived here.  It is Winged Foot.
It's almost like, you know what, two weeks ago they said they were going to have a U.S. Open here, and they grew the rough up just a little bit more.  That's great.  The course has got teeth.
Thursday conditions were as easy as they could be.  That's the easiest at a Winged Foot U.S. Open you're ever going to see.  And today -- this morning was not easy, I gather that, but the wind kind of calmed down.  We actually had stretches where there was none, so you could get at it.
But it's cliche golf, man.  You have to hit the fairway.  I have to stay below the hole.  And you've got to wedge it in front of you.
