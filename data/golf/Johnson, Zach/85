Q. What do you expect going against Jason Day tomorrow?
ZACH JOHNSON: I expect his best.  He's one of their leaders, so I've got to be on my game.
Q. You guys have different games.
ZACH JOHNSON: Completely different games.  But that's the beauty of it, too.  That's the beauty of the game, and he's a great friend.  In that regard, it's going to be a little bit difficult, too.  But I'm excited for the challenge.
