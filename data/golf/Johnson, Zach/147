Q.   Just some comments on your round, three birdies, two bogeys. 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, for the most part, it looked like I was either, you know, staring it down, trying to make a pretty legitimate birdie opportunity or I was just grinding out trying to make a par.   It was hard.   Certainly not easy, the way the ball is rolling, but I hit some good shots. 
A couple misses but a couple nice saves, too.   3â€‘putt never tastes well on 15, but once again, based on some of the shots I hit, I can't be too picky. 

Q.   The winds were obviously a lot easier today, but it's still a tough golf course.   Compare the conditions from yesterday to today. 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Vastly different, vastly different.   Certainly much more manageable but also hard.   When you have a windswept golf course from the day prior, it's not like it's going to soften up any.   It's still firm and fast, so you had to really control your distances and control your trajectory and everything you would expect at Doral.

Q.   Talk about your thoughts going into tomorrow, nobody is really running away with this thing, a lot of guys in contention?
ZACH JOHNSON:   I certainly didn't shoot my way out of it.   I mean, tomorrow is just going to be the same day, I have to hit fairways.   If I continue to hit fairways and make some putts, then who knows what can happen.
