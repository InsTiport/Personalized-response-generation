  Q. Interesting that you played with Tiger for three days in a row and shot identical scores. Nice little finish at the end, five birdies in a row, talk about that a little bit.   
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, today was a matter of persevering and getting off to the best of starts, even though I didn't play that bad really. I remained patient and got some momentum and started making some putts and seeing the line nicely and carried into the back nine and fortunately came away with a decent round.   
  
  Q. I don't think you advanced past The Barclays last year in the Playoffs?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: That's correct.  
  
  Q. And looks like that's probably going to happen this year.   
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah.  
  
  Q. What's the difference?   
 ZACH JOHNSON: I think it's a matter of everything. My game has become a little bit more complete. My ball-striking has gotten better. My putting has gotten better and I think my mental process has gotten better. It's just polishing.   
 Last year -- 2008 was a 2007 lag, Masters lag, and I just was able to maintain the good rhythm today.   
  
  Q. How important was it getting up-and-down on the last?   
 ZACH JOHNSON: Well, I mean, it was important but it wasn't the end-all-be-all. Hit a poor drive but hit a great wedge shot in there. Fortunately I was able to make the putt.
