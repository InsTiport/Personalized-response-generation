 Q. Zach, just talk a little bit about the round today. You are 5-under par and looks like you're playing a good tournament?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean I played nice for going into the weekend. I played pretty well, put myself in position to make some putts, made some, missed a lot, too. You know, you can always say that I guess. 
 The greens are perfect considering all the rain. Obviously, the fairways are very, very, very moist. But today, as I just mentioned, it's like a desert out there relative to yesterday afternoon. 
 So hopefully it will dry out. I wouldn't mind if the wind picks up a little bit. But, you know, that's all I can ask for, I'm in position.

 Q. As defending champ, you got to have some good mojo going out there?
 ZACH JOHNSON: I'm trying to forget about last year. I mean, if anything, just keep that confidence on this course. But, you know, the shots and everything that took place, I'm trying to put that behind and stick to the present.

 Q. What's the key to being here on Sunday?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Another good low number tomorrow.

 Q. What things are you going to work at, not just tomorrow, but the thing that carries over to the next couple days?
 ZACH JOHNSON: I'm going to do much of the same. I'm putting myself in position to make birdies. Hopefully, the putts will fall more tomorrow and certainly on Sunday, and put a little pressure on the leaders, you know, if I'm not quite there. Never know what can happen.

 Q. Thanks very much.
