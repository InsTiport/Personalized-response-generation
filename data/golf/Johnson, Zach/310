 Q. Zach, five birdies and three bogeys, 2-under par performance, 5-under par through 36 holes. Are you happy where you're at for 36?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I think with what the course is presenting, yeah, I'm very pleased. It's one of those places for me that puts a premium on fairways, and if I miss a fairway it's hard for me to make a par, but if I hit those fairways I can really be aggressive. All in all, I'm pleased.

 Q. Tell us how the golf course is playing. A lot of players are talking about how soft the golf course is, that it's softer than they've seen in years. Do you agree?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yes, I do agree. It's very soft right now. But we had rain on Wednesday, there's no way around that. It's draining nicely, not like we're getting a lot of mud on the ball. I think the course is responding well to the rain. However, this place, there's a lot of rain and very little saturation, it becomes very, very difficult.

 Q. Your mindset going into the final two rounds this weekend?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Very much the same. Driver is important. For me it's a pretty long beast of a course for me. I've got to get that ball in the fairway and from there hit solid iron shots. I know it's clichÃ©, but I've got to get the ball in the fairway. My bogeys today were times when I missed the fairway. I don't think I've made a bogey when I've been in the fairway. I guess that probably sums it up. And keep putting well, obviously.
