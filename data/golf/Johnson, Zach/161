Q.   68, started out well, kind of plateaued in the middle.   Are you satisfied with that round? 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, I had opportunities.   I had some putts on the back nine that I‑‑ opportunities I could have got up‑and‑down for birdie and a couple of those par‑5s that I didn't.   Other than that, pretty solid day.   No complaints.   I mean, you finish with a birdie on 18, especially after yesterday when I bogeyed it, so I'll take it. 

Q.   It looks like you're putting the ball really, really well. 
ZACH JOHNSON:   I feel great over it.   I missed one four or five‑footer today on 11, but that's really the only putt I missed that you feel like you should make.   More than that, the ones I'm missing I feel like I'm hitting on proper lines, at least the line that I'm seeing.   They may not go in, but my speed has been good, and I'm hitting them solid.
