  Q.  You moved yourself into contention today with a 66.   
 ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, it was a good day.  I got off to a bad start yesterday, and played my second nine, which was the front nine, well, and just came out today and got off to a good start and played solid.   
  
  Q.  There are some strokes to be made on the front nine, aren't there?   
 ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, there are.  The par 5s are reachable, and the wind is generally not blowing on that side.  It seems like today it's not blowing on the back, either.   
 But the front seems to be a little easier than the back.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel like you're in position for the weekend?   
 ZACH JOHNSON:  I'm probably going to be pretty far behind.  We'll see what the weather does.  Being like this, if Jerry plays well, he's going to be pretty far ahead.  I think Sunday is going to be tough.  I'll have to just hang in there and play well tomorrow and hopefully shoot a good one on Sunday.
