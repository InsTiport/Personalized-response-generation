  ZACH JOHNSON:   You're putting everything aside, you're still playing golf.   I don't know how you do it.   This was my first week as a card‑carrying member back in '04, and I missed the cut.   It's one of those things, what he's done, or what he did last year is nothing short of a miracle.

Q.   Why are you playing your best golf?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, I think with age comes experience, right, so I think I'm the most experienced I've been.   I think I've seen every arena in golf, and I've played well in essentially every arena in golf.   The setup and the makeup of the PGA TOUR doesn't affect me.   I enjoy that. 
More than that, I think it's just that my coaches and I have got a good system now.   We've got a good direction, good vision for the future, we've got a great plan for right now and just staying in the moment, staying in the process.   We've set great objective goals and drills and kind of things that I can kind of practice on that I know that transfers on the golf course. 
But yeah, I mean, other than that, I'm also healthy.   That's a big part of it out here, knock on wood.   I'm healthy. 

Q.   Two things that you talked about a lot the other day:   One was simplifying it, and what I kept thinking was it's like the most complicated game anybody could ever dream up, so how do you simplify that?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, I think it comes down to one key thing, maybe a couple key things, but most importantly, it is a very, very intricate game.   There's so many things that you can pick apart and attach to and get down to.   But I can only control the things I can control, and so that's really my focus.

Q.   How do you keep the rest out of your head?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, for lack of a better description I talk to myself about it.   At night or in the mornings before I leave, I'm just trying to say, okay, I know how I'm going to walk, I know the rhythm I'm going to swing, I know that I can control my tempo, I can know I can control my routine, I know I can control where's my target, where's my line, those things that I can visually see and mentally hold captive, I'm going to try to control.   Where the ball ends up is not entirely in my career.   That's where trust what I've done on the practice range, trust what I've done on the putting green will help me control things I can't control, and that's where the confidence comes from.
That and the fact that I just‑‑ Damon and I are just going well together.   We understand each other probably almost too well.

Q.   How long have you been together? 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, this was my first start in '04.   He caddied for Scott Hoch in Maui and he caddied for Scott Hoch here, and then we got together the next week in the decent and been together since.

Q.   So this is the anniversary?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah.   He had a couple weeks off for the birth of his kid and he's played a couple U.S. Senior Opens and that kind of thing.

Q.   Talk a little bit about the contrast, last week's golf course and this week, maybe a little bit like Augusta going to Hilton Head?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, that would be one way to compare it.   Completely different.   You're talking about the hardest walk in golf at Maui to potentially and arguably the easiest golf on the PGA TOUR here at Waialae.   Vastly different, but also challenging, too, because you're going for some of the biggest fairways and some of the smallest fairways, and you're going for some of the biggest greens and some of the smallest greens.   Everything you would want in a golf course where you've got to pick it apart and plot your way around I think this golf lends itself to.   If there's any wind here, it's hard, and it usually is blowing.   So it's not‑‑ this is clichÃ© golf.   This is hit the ball in the fairway, however you do it, get the ball in the fairway and then stay below the pin, keep the golf course in front of you, and make those four and five‑footers.   A great test.

Q.   Does it mean a lot to you to be just one of nine players to win both tournaments?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, sure, that's a nice feat.   You know, maybe some guys‑‑ I don't know, that's a very nice feat.   Does it mean a lot?   Not necessarily.   It just means that I've had some success early on in the year, and what I'm doing with my coaches has paid off.   But they're two totally vastly different golf courses, so in that regard it means a lot because that means I can play golf in different arenas, in different types of conditions.

Q.   How many coaches are we talking about here?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Quite a few.

Q.   What's Damon's last name?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Green.
