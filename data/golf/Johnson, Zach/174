Q.   Just general thoughts of the round today, a bogey‑free round here today.   How was it? 
    ZACH JOHNSON:   Pretty solid.   I drove it pretty good.   That was really what did it.   Missed maybe‑‑ I hit one bad tee shot that I can recall‑‑ maybe two. 
    Unfortunately, my putter was‑‑ yeah, I putted well.   I didn't have a lot of great close opportunities to birdie, maybe a handful.   But I putted well.   My lag putting was either really good or really terrible, and I made the ones in the back. 
    But solid.   I mean, just a solid day.

Q.   How do you look at ‑‑ right nowwhat are you, six back, seven back? 
    ZACH JOHNSON:   He's got to be 8 to 10.

Q.   He was at 10 under.   You hit 3, right?   So seven. 
    ZACH JOHNSON:   He's at 9 now?   Six back. 

Q.   So how do you look for 36 holes? 
    ZACH JOHNSON:   I hope he hits a couple of triples, which brings me back in. 
    No, two more rounds, anything can happen, especially on this golf course.   You get hot.   It's just a matter of‑‑ for me it's a matter of I've got to hit fairways, and I've got to continue to putt well because I'm not a great rough player and I can spin it on the fairways but I can't spin it on the rough.

Q.   You talked about this week being so important because you wanted to play for the Presidents Cup. 
    ZACH JOHNSON:   Yes.

Q.   Are you getting out of it what you wanted to get out of it? 
    ZACH JOHNSON:   No doubt.   Solid shots, solid putts.   That's the key this week.   Something that will carry me into my off‑week next week when I practice and something that certainly will carry me into the Presidents Cup. 
    The Presidents Cup, they put a lot of emphasis on guys playing boring golf, which is no bogeys, that's a good thing.
