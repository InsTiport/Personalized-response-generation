 Q.   At one point, Zach, it was all Europe.   They had the lead.   What was going through your mind at that moment?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, I mean, I noticed the board; I'm not going to lie to you.   The one thing I did notice, though, it was very early in the match.   This is not a sprint by any means, and it's a marathon.   You've just got to stick to your routine, stick to your process.   The difficult thing for me out there is really just kind of keeping nice and calm.   Not to be sarcastic, but yeah.
