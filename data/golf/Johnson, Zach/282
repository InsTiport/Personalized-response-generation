   ZACH JOHNSON: It occurred to me last night but not on the golf course. I mean, I was trying to -- I was actually trying to finish second. There was a point today where I had (indiscernible.) The last two days I did the same thing. I'd get off to pretty good starts, and it was like a roller coaster. 
 I guess I righted the ship today, birdieing a couple holes coming in. But for the most part, it's frustrating. I made a lot of birdies today with tough pins. It's bizarre. Two doubles took me out of it, one yesterday and one today.

 Q. So you saw a major difference at this place compared to before?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, there's definitely a difference, basically around the greens. The tee shots and the bunkers are a little bit different, just the way they're sculpted and the way they drop. But I would say the biggest difference is around the greens. The greens are -- it seems to me maybe a little bit more elevated, and the bunkers drop off and they're very severe, and the greens are firm. 
 It's a great test. It's a hard test. I said at the beginning of the week, the one that plays the best is the one that's going to win. You're not going to win this tournament by luck. I think Tiger is not really that lucky, he's good. 

 Q. Can this be a U.S. Open course?
 ZACH JOHNSON: I don't know. You know, I'm not one to measure that. I wouldn't know what the qualities or characteristics should be. I can't be one to say.

 Q. Can they make it a lot harder?
 ZACH JOHNSON: The rough could be more substantial, there's no question about that. Maybe a little tighter fairways, I don't know.
