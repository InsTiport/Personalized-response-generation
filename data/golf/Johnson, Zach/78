 Q.  You made it interesting there at the end.  Great charge with an eagle at 16, the birdie at 17.  Tell us about those two holes.  
ZACH JOHNSON: It's a great way to finish a fun week.  You know, I feel like my B game was this week and good signs of good A game and lot of signs of C and D.  I played pretty well on the weekend.  Good momentum going into next week which is all I can ask for.   
 Q.  How great is it to be a part of this field and tournament with Mr. Palmer?  
ZACH JOHNSON: Like you just said it.  Anytime you have his signature stamp on something it's pretty special.  This is his creation.  As a golfer, as a professional athlete, you know, I don't think anybody can measure truly what he means and then as a role model and, you know, a figurehead in the game of golf.   
You know, his just overall being has been so special to this game.  We all owe him a debt of gratitude.   
 Q.  Feel good about next week?  
ZACH JOHNSON: I feel good.  I felt great going into some weeks and played bad, and felt bad going into some weeks and played good.  I don't know if that really matters.  I like where I'm at.  I like the fact that I feel healthy.  This time I wasn't really healthy last year.  Lot of allergy stuff.  I feel good about things.  It's just another week.
