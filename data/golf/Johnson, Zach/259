  Q. Good start?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, that's all you can really ask for is to get off to a good start. You can't win on Thursday, but you don't want it lose it. So I feel pretty good about the way things started.  
  
  Q. You seem to be putting well?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Actually, I probably hit it better. Early on in my round yesterday, I had a lot of birdie opportunities, I mean, about five or six that weren't even -- you should make a couple, and I missed them.   
 I managed to putt well on the back nine, and that's certainly what -- I think it probably evened out.   
  
  Q. Excited about what lies ahead?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Absolutely. It's only my second round, but I'm excited. I like the way I'm striking it and I like the way I'm walking. I like the way my tempo is, my rhythm, and I'm going to go get 'em.
