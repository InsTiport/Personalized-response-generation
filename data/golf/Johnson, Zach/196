 Q.   Zach, I thought that was a very professional round of golf.   You did birdie the par 5s.   You didn't get a birdie at the 15th, and yet, here you are with a 65?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, it was a solid day.   I had a lot of opportunities.   It probably evened out.   I made some putts that were, you know, 15 to 20‑foot range, probably two or three of them, so missed some short ones.   I wish I could have gotten some of those back.   But, all in all, a pretty solid day.   I'm certainly trying to set it up for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   When you look up there and see what Hunter shot and Charley shot, do you say I got to giddy‑up here?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   I didn't see what Charley shot.   I know Hunter shot 8 this morning.   So I'm assuming it's 7 to 9?   
   
 Q.   Charley's 61, 9‑under.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, that makes sense.   It's what we expected today.   Minimum winds and pretty receptive greens overall.   The course is wonderful.   If you're hitting it solid, you can make some birdies; if you're not, it will bite you, which is exactly what you want.  
   
 Q.   I thought the greens were receptive all day long and you could be aggressive with putts?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   You could be.   There were some pin placements you could attack given the proper yardage and proper clubs.   Just try to put the ball on the position in the fairway where you can have those wedges.   Those hop shots are never easy.   So if you get the proper club, you feel like you've got to be aggressive.
