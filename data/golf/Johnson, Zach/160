Q.   You obviously had the great birdie on 18.   Do you want to just talk about just like ending on that note and how your round went today?
ZACH JOHNSON:   I mean today was tough.   It was just hard.   I mean all‑around survival slash commitment, trust, et cetera, et cetera, it was brutal.
I got off to a great start, and I was walking down 16 fairway.   So I would have been, what, 2‑over for the day at that point and I'm thinking outside of two shots I really didn't hit a bad shot.   I mean I hit two bad shots.   I hit a bad shot on three, tee box, and 11, my second shot.
My two doubles were miss clubs, which you're going to do, but I was committed and I hit them solid.   So unfortunate in that regard.   I had opportunities out there to post a really good number today, but I didn't take myself out of it certainly with 16 and 18.

Q.   Of course, and how do you plan I guess on managing it tomorrow differently?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah.   The forecast is different.   They're saying benign winds, so, you know, if that's the case, then it's back to what we did on Thursday and Friday.   It not, I just gotta be patient and trust it.   I mean as we witnessed there, Tiger backed off two or three times on 18.   I think I did that on at least two or three holes, so you just gotta commit and back off.
