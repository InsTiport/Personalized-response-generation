 Q.  Regarding today. 

 ZACH JOHNSON:  I guess if you're trying to find the beauty, it is survival.  Par is a good score.  I know if I shot par today, it would be a good number.  It is really tough out there. 

 Q.  Can you describe why it was so tough? 

 ZACH JOHNSON:  Look, she can barely write right now (referring to a reporter taking notes.)  It's hard to swing, it's hard to putt.  You have to even play the wind on your putts.  The last five or six holes I could barely feel my hands. 

 Q.  Regarding being near the lead. 

 ZACH JOHNSON:  I felt comfortable out there.  I'm trying not to get emotional...  You just have to be patient.  4-over is just a number.  There is no par out there.  Who is to say 72 is par?  I didn't putt as well today.  I played the last six holes even par and I 3-putted 16 again. 

 So, I'm pleased with my round.  I don't mind the grind.  I enjoy difficult conditions and situations. 

 Q.  Does this remind you of Iowa weather? 

 ZACH JOHNSON:  It felt like a fall day of college golf when I was forced to play.  These are the days that you don't play. 

 Tomorrow is Easter Sunday and it's extremely important to me because of my Christian faith. 

 It is more important to me than Masters Sunday, but I'm happy to be out here.
