 Q. Zach, I guess the first requirement to defend your title is to make the cut, and with a 5-under par you've successfully done that, and you're really in touch with the leaders. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah. I'm certainly not out of it. 
 I had a couple opportunities I could have probably made more of a push, but today was much like yesterday, a lot of positives, certainly. 
 Maybe a little bit of polishing on the weekend, and hopefully we can make a push.

 Q. 31 putts in the opening round, 29 putts on Friday morning. Probably want to sharpen up the putting?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah. I'm actually giving myself some decent opportunities. Not hitting it that close. A lot of 10 to 20-footers, and a bunch of misreads, and when I did read them correctly, seems like I miss-hit them. So it's just a matter of, like you said, maybe committing to my line more and hitting my putts more. 

 Q. Is the course playing a little faster? Seems like the winds have dried out a little bit. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah. Could be. Any time the wind picks up in the afternoon, especially as the week goes on, and no more rain, yeah, it's going to get a little more dry. 
 The fairways have been rolling pretty well since the beginning of the week. The greens are still receptive with the loft in your hand, but yeah, with the mid-iron and the long-iron you gotta pay attention.

 Q. This course will give up some low numbers. J.P. Hayes with a 62, obviously some numbers out there, and you can make a big move on the weekend. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Absolutely. It bites you if you're off, but if you're on, you can make a good number out there. 

 Q. Look forward to the weekend with you. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Thank you.
