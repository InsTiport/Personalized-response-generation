  Q. What are your thoughts about the way things evolved?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Very frustrating. Very frustrating.  
  
  Q. Was the frustration for the entire round?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: No, I would just say towards the latter part of the day. I feel like I was hitting it fine and then just started to force the issue and made some pretty poor mistakes, and it cost me a lot.   
  
  Q. Is the course getting harder?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: No, I don't think it's getting any harder than it has the last two days anyway, no.  
  
  Q. Is the lack of wind, is that it?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: That's part of it, yeah. Plus this is one of those winds that you can be aggressive with, I think.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about the putting?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Putting is fine. Essentially I haven't three-putted yet. You know, I'm not knocking down pins, but I'm hitting quality shots, mis-clubbing maybe here and there, but I'm hitting quality shots. I'm putting the ball -- when I'm thinking straight I'm putting the ball on the appropriate side of the hole and for the most part getting up-and-down when I need to.   
 The last three holes, two holes, I mean, really I -- whatever. I played those holes decent, and I shoot 1-over probably, 2-over at the most, but I didn't miss many greens and had a lot of good birdie opportunities. I hit two good shots on 15 and walk away with a 5. But that's Augusta. It's a major.
