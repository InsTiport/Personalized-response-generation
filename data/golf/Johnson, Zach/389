ZACH JOHNSON:  I made my share of the first four matches, so, you know, I'm going to recover and try to play good tomorrow.
Q.  What do you get out of a tournament, even though it's match play, instead of regular stroke play when you go and beat two guys that were in the top 10?
ZACH JOHNSON:  It's a huge confidence boost for me.  I take just as much from beating out the other two guys, Shingo and Sean O'Hair; everybody is good.  On a given day, anybody can win.  I feel fortunate to be where I'm at, and I just think if I can keep this momentum going, a lot of good things can come.
Q.  What about tomorrow and playing with Tom Lehman; is that any pressure for you?
ZACH JOHNSON:  No, not necessarily.  He's good; there's no question about that.  He's been playing really well, especially the last six, seven months.  He's a good friend of mine, too.  I feel like I know him pretty well.

Yeah, I'm going to try to play my best, regardless of who I play.  And seeing that he's the Ryder Cup captain, maybe it will help, I don't know.  But it doesn't matter.  I'm going to go out there and play my best.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ZACH JOHNSON:  That was one of the shots for sure.  Just a mental lapse.  I think I was lined up correctly, just didn't put a good swing on it, and it cost me a shot.
Q.  What iron were you hitting?
ZACH JOHNSON:  3 iron.
Q.  What was the other shot you were talking about?
ZACH JOHNSON:  I think 10 was not a very good shot.  My second shot was right in the middle of the fairway.  I should have    I was not happy with the number, not happy with the swing, and I still went along with it.  I had an opportunity there because he hit one and spun back.  So I could have gotten to 10 or 12 feet and had a birdie shot there.
