ZACH JOHNSON:  There's been peaks and valleys for sure, but for whatever reason my game seems to    seems to go upward and onward and then it gets up there, and I play pretty well for a while and then it kind of goes back down.  It's cyclical.  That's the nature of this game.  I'm pretty pleased.  I'm just going to try to keep working hard and getting better.
Q.  Playing with Stuart Appleby today, were you playing off each other a little bit?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, I actually played with him Thursday and Friday, too.  Yeah, I mean, you know, our rhythms are pretty similar.  I think that's the key thing.  He takes about as much time as I do.  He got off to a great start the first two holes and had to kick it in high gear just to keep up with him.  He played pretty darned good today.  He could have shot even lower than that.
Q.  You're right in the thick of things, what is your mind set going into tomorrow?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Mind set tomorrow is keep doing what I'm doing.  Fairways and greens, I know it's a cliche, but that's the thing to do.  Especially on this golf course, you know, it's obviously a major worthy golf course, very receptive still because of the humidity.  The greens are holding well, and not overly hard and fast.  So it's fair, it's right out in front of and you it's really good.
