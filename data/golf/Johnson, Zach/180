 Q.   Just talk about your round today and the conditions out there.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, I thought it was a lot harder.   I mean, I don't know what the scores are showing, but I thought it was significantly harder.   I mean, granted, it was cooler.   You had to monitor the gusts.   You had to pay attention on the greens with the wind.   I thought it was just harder to hit fairways.   I thought it was just harder all around.   
No, I mean, saying that, you can certainly put a number up.   I mean, 5‑ to 6‑under certainly was out there, 6‑ to 7‑ even if you make a couple putts.   But I shot 1.   I feel good about it, left some out there.   I missed some short putts and put myself in some predicaments I shouldn't have been in, but for the most part pretty solid coming down the stretch.   
   
 Q.   Furyk right now has got two holes to play and he's at 11‑under.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   For the day?   Seriously?   
   
 Q.   Yeah, he's got about a five‑foot putt for a 59 on No.8.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   He's on No.8 to go to 59?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   Obviously you didn't see that out there, huh?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   No.   I don't have anything to say about that.   That is ridiculous.  
   
 Q.   With a bogey.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   That's even more ridiculous.   Oh, my gosh.   He's going to shoot 59?
