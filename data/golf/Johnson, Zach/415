ZACH JOHNSON:  I've got that kind of secured.  I hate looking at numbers, but absolutely, I want to secure top 20 to get in all the majors next year.  That's the big goal, as well.  I've got a bunch of events left and hopefully I can build on last week into this week and for the rest of the year.
Q.  You played well last week.  What's been the secret lately?
ZACH JOHNSON:  You know, I don't know.  I'm putting well.  That's always key, and I'm hitting my driver well.  My irons are okay.  I'm hitting the ball in the fairway and I'm seeing the line really well six feet and in.  That's probably the key factors in my score, for sure.
Q.  How's your comfort zone?  I know coming from the PGA TOUR and now you've played some majors and now some world championships.  Are you kind of getting acclimated to this?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Absolutely.  Coming out this year, I figured I could do well out here, but it's nice knowing that I don't really have to change my game, I've just got to sharpen it up.  There's a lot of room for improvement, and if I can do that for myself, I can do well.
Q.  Nice change of pace to play with some different players than you usually play with on Tour?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Absolutely.
Q.  Just guys from all over the world, must be a fun experience, too.
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, it's great.  You see them on TV, you know.  I watch a lot of the Golf Channel and European Tour and Tours overseas.  It's nice seeing those faces and meeting them.  It's great.
