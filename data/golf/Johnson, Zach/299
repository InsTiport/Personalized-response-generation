 Q. You shot a 68 today. I mean, talk about conditions. I take it you're pleased with the round. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, definitely pleased. It's always sour ending with a bogey, but at the same time I made some putts today and gave myself a lot of good opportunities, making birdies or even salvaged pars. All in all I'm very pleased today, and it put me in position for tomorrow.

 Q. Despite the gusty winds out there, you hit 12 of 18 greens today. That was the best of the week for you. That speaks to the fact that you're giving yourself those opportunities. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, exactly. You know, it's tough to come out in these conditions. I was sick for two weeks and now I'm starting to feel healthy, which is kind of nice. I don't have to worry about cough drops or cold medicine or anything like that when I'm playing anymore, and it's just nice being out there and going out and playing golf and being healthy.

 Q. Just a few minutes after 4:00 now on the East Coast here. Can you give us an indication overall how this golf course is playing, just how tough it is?
 ZACH JOHNSON: It's playing very difficult. I think they softened the greens. They probably put some water on them based on the wind because they were firmer Thursday and Friday. So given that, you know, you can hit quality shots and be rewarded. 
 At the same time, it's a position golf course now. You're just plotting your way around, fairway, green, and then trying to two-putt most of the time. It's difficult. Par is a great number today.
