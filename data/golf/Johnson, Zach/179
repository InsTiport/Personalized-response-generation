Q.   We thought it was going to be a day for incredible scoring, but outside of a couple of rounds it was actually pretty challenging out there today.   Did it surprise you a little bit?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, as the day goes on it gets crustier and crustier and firmer and firmer.   The fact that Nick hit a tee shot 365 yards into the water, you just don't expect those kind of things.   So there was some difficulty in approach shots, there was some difficulty around the greens, pitching and putting.   But I mean, you hit solid shots, you can still get at it.

Q.   Kind of got off to a slow start but kind of got into a grind.   At any point were you realizing that this thing was developing a little bit differently, just grind out a couple of good holes and see where it stood?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, that's kind of what I do.   I feel like I had some opportunities out there, hit some good shots that didn't pan out, hit some average shots where I had to scramble, like you said.   A couple maybe missed yardages with layâ€‘ups and that kind of thing, but I feel good.   I'm doing good things.   I wish I could have the one back on the 18th.   I'm sitting there in prime position to make a 4, and come away with a 5.   But that's Conway Farms, and I've got 18 more holes.

Q.   Looks like you'll have a head start over that last group by a couple of minutes, sort of the same position you found yourself in today.   Your approach to tomorrow?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, it's going to be a day of patience.   There might be a slight change of mental approach because of the saturation if we do get that rain, whichI think it's 90 or 100 percent they're saying, so quite probable, but nothing we're not accustomed to.
