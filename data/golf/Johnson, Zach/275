 Q. Zach, bogey-free, 5-under, do you have any idea how good that round was today on this golf course?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Well, when you play like that, yeah, I guess I have an idea. You know, I played solid. Maybe a couple of greens were a little off, was able to make a few putts. Putted really well. 

 Q. Everybody's here for a different reason. Why is Zach Johnson in this field, the last field of the year?
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah. Well, this is one of those weeks for me where a little different than last year. Last year was a little more pressure on me. I wanted to end on a good note and had quite a few in '08, and this year I'm here for pretty much one reason. I'm a free roller. It's kind of the thing you do. 
 Obviously the Children's Miracle Network is fantastic in what they're able to do and the money they're able to raise for the hospitals and kids is great and if you throw in the fact that we're at Disney World makes it that much sweeter.

 Q. You have the Palm Course tomorrow. Supposed to be warmer. Great round today. Good luck to you. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Thank you. Appreciate it.
