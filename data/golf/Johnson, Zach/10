 Q.  (Indiscernible - wind interference.)  
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, a little redemption from this morning. Felt good when I came out here at 7:30, so happy about that. Two good shots and obviously hit a good putt.   
Yeah, it's good momentum. Hopefully I can maintain that going into the Sunday.   
 Q.  You probably get your days mixed up. Crazy how this tournament has gone with the delays. How have you dealt with that?  
ZACH JOHNSON: Well, it's very normal out here. If we have a Thursday through Sunday with nothing, seems almost unusual. So you just get used to it. You know what to do. You got to find your rest, find your recovery, obviously maintain calories and all that good stuff.   
But golf is a game of rhythm, so you got to try to stay in it as best you can, which isn't easy.   
But, again, we're used to it. Weather delays are a part of the PGA TOUR.   
 Q.  And just talk about the conditions of the course.  
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I enjoy the golf course. Obviously this is my first time here, so it's been good for me to at least get three good rounds under me to really pick it apart.   
The course is right out in front of you. I think when it comes down to it, if you can get experience on the greens it can pay dividends. I enjoy it. I love the classic style of it. Certainly love being in Jackson. Fans are fantastic.   
 Q.  What do you think is going to be the key on Sunday as this wraps up?  
ZACH JOHNSON: I think mental mistakes. I think boring golf. It's hard to control the ball out of the rough, so you got to hit fairways, give your putter a chance, and make a few putts.
