Q.  Do you have a game plan for this afternoon?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Keep my same game plan and don't do anything out of my game.
Q.  What was the key hole for you?
ZACH JOHNSON:  I don't know if there really was one.  I would say early on.
Q.  When did you go 2 up?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Early on, I would say No. 4, because he won 1 and 2.  And I came back and was able to win 3 and 4 to get it even.  So that was big.  Then I just started hitting some decent shots.

On the front, I think we halved like two holes.  So nothing    I was not very consistent.  I was just kind of up and down.  But after that I just played    I tried to hit fairways, fairways and greens.  I don't think I missed a fairway and I don't think I missed a green in the back.  When you have a lead, you can be a little more conservative and put pressure on just by doing that.

I feel fortunate to come away.  He had some good putts that didn't go in, and I made some putts.  That's probably what it came down to.
Q.  Considering you got in the semis, was that one of the biggest golf rounds to date?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Today, yes, maybe you could look at it that way.  I've had some big rounds in the past.  I've actually had    the Q School rounds, those were big.  As far as a match, yes, that's the biggest I've played.
Q.  Do you think there's an advantage because these other guys are still playing?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Everybody is still playing?
Q.  Extra holes except for Davis, here on 18.  But they've gone the whole 18.  They're all square.
ZACH JOHNSON:  I don't know.  You can look at it as an advantage, but at the same time they're seeing 17 and 18 again, whatever.  I think the guys are too good to    if you're playing two or three extra holes, three or four extra holes, if you're playing 36 in one day, it's not a big deal, 36, 40.
