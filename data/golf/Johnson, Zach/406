ZACH JOHNSON:  I feel good about where things are.  I'm still, as far as my game goes, I want to get 72 holes in for sure.  It's a good experience for me, all four days, if you can get four days in.

Obviously the weather is very frustrating, but it's frustrating for everybody.  It's not like it's just me.  It's probably at least frustrating for the players -- I shouldn't say that.  We don't have to do anything.  We've got the grounds crew out there busting their butts, and it stinks for the fans, it stinks for the whole tournament, it stinks for Jacksonville, it stinks for Atlanta next week where hopefully I can try to defend, so hopefully it's a kind of a situation where Mother Nature is doing her thing and we've just got to roll with the punches.
Q.  You've been close to the lead, so talk about having to sleep on good performances more than just one night; it's been two or three nights now.
ZACH JOHNSON:  It's easier to sleep.  I like being in contention.  I mean, all in all, there's been a lot of positives so far.  I've had a couple of hiccups on the golf course the last two rounds -- the first and second round, but nothing -- this golf course can do it.  That's the beauty of this golf course.

I look forward to the end of the week.
