ZACH JOHNSON:  He actually hit a good shot, and it didn't check.  It landed over the bunker and rolled.  He was just barely off the green.  I hit in the fairway and then hit my second shot to probably about    it had to be at least 30 feet, I'd say 35, maybe 45, 60, 70, 80 (laughter).
Q.  Two great birdies?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah.
Q.  Two great birdies in a row?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, I made a bomb.
Q.  On 17?
ZACH JOHNSON:  On 17.
Q.  Then on 16, did you birdie that, too?
ZACH JOHNSON:  No, uh uh.  I birdied 18.
Q.  Was there a ground under repair issue out there or something like that?
ZACH JOHNSON:  I had seams, and he would have given me the drop.  I just wanted to find out the rule first.  I didn't know if it was like the entire grass area or just the seams.  Evidently it was just the seams.

I was not on a seam.  My club in my opinion probably would not have touched a seam.  I probably could have gotten away with it, but at the same time I don't think I could have lived with myself knowing I did the wrong thing.  It really wasn't that bad of a lie.  I'm making it a lot more than what it was.
Q.  Obviously you hit the shot you wanted to there?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Obviously.
Q.  Did you have questions about the putt because you looked at it two or three different times?
ZACH JOHNSON:  No, that's kind of normal.  If I read it, I'm committed to my read.  If I stand over it and it feels like it's way off, which it kind of felt, then I'm going to change it.  I thought it was straight, and then it was actually about left center, inside left.  So I changed it.
Q.  Was there a turning point in this match as you look back at it?
ZACH JOHNSON:  I don't know.  I mean, we both played okay on the back.
Q.  He was up going into 16?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, I was up 2 through two, and then we both just absolutely butchered 4.  I missed a three footer for double and I think he won with a bogey.  And then he won three holes in a row, 7, 8 and 9, and that's what turned it around for him, for sure.

I had some opportunities on the back.  10 I had a birdie putt, 13 I had a birdie putt, 14 I made par and he had a tough    he had a really unfortunate lie on 14.
Q.  That was the turning point a little bit?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, I birdied 15 to go back 1 up.  It was fairly equal.  I don't think I played any better than he did, and I don't think he played any better than I did.  It was one of those that    I'm not saying we both deserved to win, but I don't know if we both deserved to lose.
Q.  It was just a good match.
ZACH JOHNSON:  That's what match play is all about.
Q.  You lost in the first round last year?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Lost would be an understatement.  I think it was like 4 & 3.
Q.  Who did you lose to?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Luke Donald.
Q.  It must feel good to get to the second round?
ZACH JOHNSON:  It feels great.
Q.  Who do you play?
ZACH JOHNSON:  As long as I don't have that guy that was up 8 through eight (laughter).
