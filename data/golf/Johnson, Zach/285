   ZACH JOHNSON: One of those days I got off to a good start and putted well, so try and keep it going. Kind of nice to get the momentum for another 18 holes. 

 Q. And a great par save on the last. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, thank you. It was a couple bogey putts -- a bogey putt and a par putt that really kept the day going for me.

 Q. And your chance going off when you're going off to post a number. 
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah. I mean, 18 more holes. Hopefully I can keep it going.
