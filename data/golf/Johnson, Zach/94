 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
ZACH JOHNSON: Yep, by two months.  Over Henrik.   
 Q.  Do you want to just talk about the course today and the difference in how it played?  
ZACH JOHNSON: Oh, the course was pretty easy, with the exception of the 9th, the 10th, and the 11th.   
 Q.  Can you elaborate?  
ZACH JOHNSON: Elaborate?  No, it was harder today.  The ball was going shorter, a lot more -- a lot longer clubs into holes.   
I even hit some drives today that I thought I hit better and still had longer shots in.   
The greens are still perfect.  For the most part I think I had one mud, maybe two mud balls and I got lucky with one in the sense that I was in casual.   
So it's just really, really difficult right now.  Those swells that came in with the rain and the wind, that made it difficult.   
Rory kind of got in front of me there, made it difficult -- no, I'm just kidding.  It was just hard.  It was hard to execute, hard to commit, hard to hit shots when all those elements are presented.  But it's what you expect, it's East Lake, and my round in particular was roller coaster.  I played greater early, played poorly in the middle and played great at the end.
