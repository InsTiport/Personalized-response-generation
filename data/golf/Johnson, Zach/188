  ZACH JOHNSON:     Yeah, we've been through it so many times, you know what to do. 

Q.   A little bit up‑and‑down on the back nine, a couple birdie stretch there, and also a nice par on 18?
ZACH JOHNSON:     That's certainly one I'm going to dwell on is the par on 18.   I played pretty good‑‑ I hit a couple squirrely shots on the back nine, there's no question about that, but I had a couple of good saves, too.   It probably all evens out.   I left some out there, but I managed to save some, too.   So all in all, more positives than negatives.

Q.   Going into playing tomorrow morning, what's the rest of your day look like? 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Practice a little bit, get some tissue work done, have a good meal go, to bed and have a good night's rest and do it again tomorrow.
