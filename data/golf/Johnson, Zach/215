Q.   Talk about today.   You missed only one fairway, only three greens.   Really a solid day. 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, today was good.   I struck it nicely, off the tee especially.   I put myself in position to be aggressive into these pins.   Hit some good putts, hit some bad putts, but I made my fair share.   I had a lot of opportunities.   That's really what you want when conditions are soft, and personally I had that.

Q.   I've followed you a lot the first two playoff events, and now this is clearly your best round so far. 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, it's coming along.   My putting has been off, and I haven't struck it fantastic the first two weeks.   But when your putting is off and it's kind of paining you mentally, kind of wearing on you, it creeps into other parts of your game, and mentally you get a little stressed. 
It's getting there.   I feel good about things.   I think my putter is certainly what I'm most confident as far as progress. 

Q.   Course conditions:   Obviously you liked them today? 
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, typically wet conditions are not favorable for me, but this course does have some rough, and it is penal if you hit it in the rough.   I think the greens are good.   I like bentgrass greens.   That's what I grew up on.   I can see the breaks, I can see the lines, and apart from one or two misreads, I had a good putting round.
