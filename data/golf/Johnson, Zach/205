 Q.   Did you know what was going on out on the course and what were your thoughts over that putt on 16?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   The first part of the question, I glanced at the board here and there.   It certainly looked like it was a lot of blue early and kind of leveled off in the middle.   Frankly I haven't seen it in probably four or five holes.   I'm not too sure where everything is at right now, but yeah, the putt on 16 was massive.   I didn't make many putts today.   Frankly I didn't make many putts this week.   But that was the one that was pretty important just to get the halve at least, and then obviously 17 speaks for itself.
