 Q.  Assess your round today in the conditions that you played in?  
ZACH JOHNSON: Today it was solid.  Granted, score says, I guess, it was a good day.  I mean, truthfully, I felt like I left a lot out there.   
I made a couple putts, one on 6 and one on 12, but I tapped in basically on all four par-5s.  I had a couple eagle putts that I could have made.  Had two significant lipouts -- I mean it is what it is.   
I hit it good, I drove it well, I think I missed one, maybe two fairways today.  I'm assuming, all assumptions, that it was a little windier this afternoon versus the morning, based on the scores.  I'm assuming the greens were a little bit better in the morning, which it should be.   
But I'm very pleased.  I kept the golf course in front of me and gave myself a number of opportunities.   
 Q.  Knowing how difficult this course can play, do you take special appreciation when you do have conditions like this and scoring chances?  
ZACH JOHNSON: A bunch of us were playing some practice rounds, I'm assuming most of the guys were saying the same thing, that it -- I've been told they're going to redo the greens after this year and so you kind of expected maybe some burnt conditions, because this is the last year, why not, right?   
But they're receptive, they're holding.  There's -- you're getting a little bit of roll in the fairway, but that's what you expect on Bermuda and no rain.   
Man, these greens are, they roll fine and they're holding.  Got a little crusty here at the end of the day, that's why, I think, one of the reasons why you're seeing not as many low scores this afternoon.  It was just hard to make putts inside of 10 feet.   
But it's still a great test.  This is, it's a Pete Dye -- I love the demented look of what Pete Dye does here, I just love it.
