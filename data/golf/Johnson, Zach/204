Q.   Zach Johnson with a 5‑under‑par round today, bogey free.   Tell me about you playing here.   Obviously you won John Deere after a long wait there.   What is it like playing at home, and how has the adjustment been to handling that?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, it's never easy.   I mean it is a situation the more you're in, certainly the better off you can perform just from the experience standpoint.   I really just started to embrace it.   That's really all you can do.   I like both golf courses, meaning the John Deere at TPC Run and certainly here at Seaside.   So I enjoy the walk of the golf course.
It's nothing more than that.   I'm just trying to go out there and play and just trying to keep it as simple as possible.   And today was great because I'm playing with two of my best buddies.

Q.   Obviously you won the Masters.   With that said, would you consider this your best year and you have a chance for a third win?
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, it's in there.   You could argue it.   I could probably answer that question better next week.   I've got my team, we're going to collaborate rate and kind of talk about the year, goals and the year to come. 
This one probably parallels and surpasses 2009, statistically and probably with goals.   A lot of positives, a lot of positives.   Certainly some areas that if I can, I want to improve on.   So I don't want to get content with it.   Fortunately there's a lot of great players playing better than I am and winning a lot more than I am.   So there's always that motivation.
