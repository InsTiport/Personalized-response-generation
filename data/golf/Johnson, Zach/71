  ZACH JOHNSON: It was tough. It is what it is right now. Fast greens. Gusty winds. Commitment and being patient, waiting for the proper wind at times to give you the opportunity, is crucial. You also have to be practical about it and realistic. 

Q. Because on 4 you kind of did wait for the wind?
ZACH JOHNSON: Yes. I waited until it settled a little bit. I hit a good shot. 

Q. You mentioned the words patience and commitment. You talked about that in the moment on the tee, but how much does commitment to you in the majors come into play?
ZACH JOHNSON: I think it's crucial no matter where you are, but Augusta National, with a severe golf course like this, fair but severe golf course like this, it's of the utmost. Again, patience is not getting too ahead of yourself, not looking at your scorecard, just doing what you're doing, playing your game, not trying to force the issue and eliminating big mistakes.

Q. I know your putt on 7 got you the lead at that point. You waved at the crowd and stuff. How good was it to get up early?
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, that was nice, especially bogeying the 2nd hole. That's a hole where you take par at worst, and should have an opportunity for 4. But I make 6 there. I'm 1‑over for two holes. 
The one at 7 is not one I'm trying to make, I'm trying to snuggle it up three or four feet.

Q. You got a little chicken dance from Damon [Green] today. Does it surprise you how animated he gets out there?
ZACH JOHNSON: He doesn't get animated. That's all you'll see. 

Q. The back nine, how was that challenge for you?
ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I felt great out there. I hit good shots that didn't pan out. And then I hit some average shots that kind of cost me. Three‑putt on 11 and three‑putt on 14, I felt like I hit good shots. I didn't hit a great putt on 11 but my second putt was beautiful. I thought I made birdie on 13. I misread that, missed a short one up 14. On 15 I've got a perfect 3‑wood down there, hammered a drive down there, and sure I'm going to make five. A little frustrated. 
17 I hit a great drive, in between clubs, played smart and just got pounded. I made a miraculous 4.
Making a birdie on 18 is a substantial bonus. 

Q. Has there a particular part of your game that is shining?
ZACH JOHNSON: I usually drive it pretty good. It's narrow with trees. Intermediate cut is not that big a deal. It's just a tougher drive now than what it was.

Q. The greens, has that been a key to your success at Augusta?
ZACH JOHNSON: Anybody that plays well here putts well.
