 Q. You and Jason played together today.   Did you play during the week and what was practicing with him like?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   I think we played every round together if I'm not mistaken.   We kind of knew going into it that we wanted to play together, and Davis liked how it fit.   Ultimately it's certainly not our decision, but he wanted our input and we thought it would be good for a number of reasons.   Similar games, similar demeanors.   I mean, I'm pretty calm and cool out there.   He might be borderline dead, but I think it's a good thing.   I think we just kind of have the same mentality out there, and I think we're going to be a good team.   
   
 Q.   How excited are you playing your first Ryder Cup on U.S. soil?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   I don't know if you can describe any words.
