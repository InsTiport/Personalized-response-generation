Q.
Zach, you guys battled hard.  You could have let it get away from you and you didn't.  Take me through your thoughts on the last few holes.
ZACH JOHNSON:  Well, to be honest with you, I just said, you know what, we could possibly lose this.  The way things were going, we were pretty much putting, it was kind of looking that way.

But, you know, you've got to stay in the moment and you've got to stay in the present, stay into the shot at hand, and so Chad and I just said, not today.  If they win it, they are going to have to make some putts.  And actually, they kind of did, but we were able to muster some good shots and halve the match.
Q.  Nice birdie on 17.  Was it about a 15 footer?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Yeah, I don't know, 15, 20 feet, I don't know.
Q.  And McGinley answered.
ZACH JOHNSON:  He did.  I figured I had to make that obviously.  He hit a great putt there, as well, so it was a great match.  I mean, we didn't play great.  I don't necessarily think they played great and it probably ended up the way it should have ended.
Q.  People say alternate shot is a difficult thing, catch your rhythm and it's your first time under the gun and the butterflies are gone for everybody now I'm sure.
ZACH JOHNSON:  It's very difficult, that's the one thing I learned today, and it's also    alternate shot depends on the kind of golf course you're playing, too.  Aside from the two 3 woods I hit, I only hit 2 iron shots into greens on 18 holes, which is fine, that's the way it is set up.  But you've got to stay, try to get into a rhythm and try to keep the same tempo.  It's very, very difficult but it's also a lot of fun.
