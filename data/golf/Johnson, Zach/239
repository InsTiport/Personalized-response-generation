 Q.   Nice playing, especially on that one six‑hole stretch.   
ZACH JOHNSON:   Thanks, yeah.   I had a lot of good opportunities there and made some putts.   Actually missed a short one on five which would have extended it, and I missed a short one on 12, and 13 technically.   You know, looking at the negatives right now.   There were a lot of positives.  
   
 Q.   Did you just hit a zone?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, I got good yardages, hit solid shots and hit solid putts.   My putting is starting to come along, which is the key.   I'm finally starting to get into a better, just, rhythm with my putter.  
   
 Q.   What happened on 16?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, it was a bad‑‑ misjudge of the wind, misjudge of the line with the wind.   Actually I didn't hit that bad of a shot.   I hit it five to ten yards left of where we were looking, and even if I would have hit it right where we were looking it wouldn't have turned out well.   Mis‑club there; bad choice on our part.  
   
 Q.   Tiger and K.J. pulling away a little bit, but another low round for you tomorrow, you never know?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, 36 holes, right?   Those guys are playing good obviously, so they're going to be hard to touch.   But hopefully they get stale.
