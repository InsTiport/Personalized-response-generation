  Q. Bogey-free on a Saturday afternoon, 5-under. Tell me about that eagle on 16.   
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, solid. Yeah, I hit a good tee shot there. I was in between a 4-iron and a 5-iron, and we're like, if you hit it solid, it's going to get there, and I hit it too solid, I guess, and it went a little long. But drew a nice lie in the sand and hit one of those shots out of the trap that felt good right off the face, and a little lucky and fortunately it went in.  
  
  Q. Your opening rounds, 30, 31 putts. 25 putts in the third round.   
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, that was the difference. I've been hitting it good. Shooting 2-under and having 30 and 31 putts, I'm obviously doing something right, and today I hit it solid and finally made some more putts.  
  
  Q. I know this golf course is playing hard, yet we see a bunch of low numbers in already.   
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, if you're controlling your trajectory, that's what it's about today, you can put a good number up. The greens are pure. If you hit it on line they're going to go in. They're getting faster, a little more firm, but with minimal rough and pure greens, it's there, but it's also got some teeth if you're a little off.
