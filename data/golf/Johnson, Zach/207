 Q.   How much were you watching?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Periodically.   Maybe early on a little bit.   I wasn't too focused on it.   Obviously I can't control it.   The only thing I was trying to do was control my ball, and at times I did that okay.  
   
 Q.   What was Davis' message today before you came guys out on the course?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Oh, it's the same every day.   He kept us loose, kept us wanting to enjoy it.   Nothing more than that.  
   
 Q.   How confident were you when you regained the lead at 12 to 11 that you could pull this thing off?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Frankly I didn't know what the scores were, so I didn't know.   But I had faith in my team, there's no doubt about that.   There's a lot of talent, and it's one of those things where it doesn't matter who plays who.   Any given day anybody can beat anybody.   
   
 Q.   How was this whole experience?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   The Ryder Cup is the best thing I've ever experienced in golf.   I don't know if there's anything relatively close.   Majors are fun, but when it comes down to it, yeah, this is adding a team atmosphere to a very individual game and representing your country and captains and peers.   It's just a unique experience, something I'll very much cherish.
