 Q.   1‑under 69 today.   Considering the conditions with the kind, how good is that?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   I mean, yeah, it's good.   I played really‑‑ as a competitor, as a golfer, you think, if this one would have dropped or that one would have dropped, but I can't be too upset.   Made a lot of putts but missed a lot of short ones.   
If I get the putter correct a little bit‑‑ in this kind of wind, these conditions, putting is almost harder than hitting shots.   They are equal because you have to pay attention with the wind.  
   
 Q.   Expecting more wind and rain, what will those conditions do to the golf course?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Obviously we expect wind here.   It's South Florida and that's the norm.   If we get some rain, the course will soften a little bit.   The greens are still receptive, so in that regard, that just makes it softer.   It's nice getting a little bit of roll in the fairway.   It's nice seeing that.   We rarely have that here.   They took away the overseed and kept the bermuda.   It will just be a little bit easier as far as shot‑making goes.
