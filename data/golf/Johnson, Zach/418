ZACH JOHNSON:  You know, I didn't strike it as well as I did the last three days today, and I putted decent.  I didn't make anything -- not that I had a top 3 option coming in here.  The course played a little more difficult today.  The pins and the wind switched it seemed like every hole.

A lot of this game is having good yardages.  My yardages weren't as good as they were the last three days.
Q.  Talk about your week here on the Iowa border.
ZACH JOHNSON:  It was good.  I had a decent week.

I think I'm probably top 5 or so.  I'm a little disappointed today, but nonetheless, I played pretty solid.  Hopefully I can turn it into something better next week.
Q.  How about the support you got out here?
ZACH JOHNSON:  Phenomenal.  They're unbelievable.  They don't care if I make it 10 or 2.  They're unbelievable.  I feel very fortunate to have all those fans and family, friends, too, so I'm very blessed.
