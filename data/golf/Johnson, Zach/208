  ZACH JOHNSON:   We think the same, our mentalities are the same, I would say our games are very similar.   The only thing that was different today is that Duf carried me.

Q.   What makes you two click? 
JASON DUFNER:   You know, like Zach was saying, very similar games, very similar demeanors, and you know, it's just been a good chemistry.   We were there for each other, we pull each other up when we need it, and we're supportive when things are going well.   So it's been a good little alternateâ€‘shot team, so we're looking forward to the best ball.
