  Q. Even par, happy with that today?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: You know, we were just talking about it on the 18th green. I three-putted once from like 50 feet and hit a poor chip on one hole, made two bogeys and two birdies, and quite honestly, I would have had to make a pretty lengthy putt to get under par. I'm not saying it evened out, but I couldn't have done a whole lot better, maybe 2, 3 or 4. I think 4-under today is a heck of a round. I played pretty steady, never took myself out of the hole, and hit some quality shots. Even my bogeys, I hit good shots.   
 I'm encouraged, I've just got to settle down and make some more putts tomorrow and see what happens.  
  
  Q. You've had some great success here shooting 60, obviously somewhat of a different golf course or very much of a different golf course. The greens are a lot tougher now.   
 ZACH JOHNSON: Significantly more difficult in my opinion. We're not getting as much roll as we did that year. Yeah, the greens, back then, they were just landing and stopping. Now they're releasing significantly, wedges are releasing in some instances, and you know, it seems like the greens respond harder than what they even roll. They're not slow by any stretch, but they're not as fast as they are hard.
