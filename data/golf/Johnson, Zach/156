 Q.   You made a lot of pars today, not bad, but do you feel like you left a lot out there?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Yeah, I feel like I left quite a bit out there.   At the same time, I didn't feel like I played that bad either.   Hit some good shots I didn't get anything out of, didn't make any putts today and a couple errant drives that cost me on the back nine.   Just didn't get much out of it.   
   
 Q.   There's a lot of tough competitors right up at the top there, very close together.   Does that affect your game plan for tomorrow?   
ZACH JOHNSON:   No.   That's what you expect.   Especially if you have a poor day, you expect guys‑‑ some of the guys who played good to jump you.   I'm not out of it.   I've still got 18 more holes.   I feel good.   I feel good about my game and I feel good about the way I'm going about the day and the way Damon and I are attacking it.   So I've just got to hit some better shots tomorrow and make some putts.  
   
 Q.   What do you think it's going to take tomorrow?  
ZACH JOHNSON:   Well, that depends on the conditions.   It's all based on wind.   If it's similar conditions, I'm going to have to make some birdies.
