Q. A lot of ebb and flow in that match. How did you see it?
TODD WHITE: You know, he made some great up-and-downs. You've got to give him credit, to the game that he played. I felt like I let just a couple of holes get away from me there at the end, 16 and 17 especially. But going extra holes, like I said, you've got to give him credit. He birdies No. 2, an easy little par-3 there. My hats off to him.
Q. When you got it to 2-up, what were you doing well?
TODD WHITE: I was striking the ball well, just like I did yesterday and through the two stroke play rounds. I still hit the ball well. I didn't putt very well down the stretch, and ultimately that's what's sending me home.
Q. Is there any one stroke you wish you had back coming down the stretch?
TODD WHITE: I'd like to have the third shot on 16 back. That's the one right there, I felt like I might have an advantage there, just let it get away from me a little bit, went over the back of the green, and from there he makes birdie, and again, give him credit, he played well.
Q. You had an injury coming into the year. Do you feel like you're back from that injury, and where do you stand now?
TODD WHITE: I'd like to think that I'm back. The broken wrist that didn't allow me to touch a golf club for almost seven and a half months, I didn't start playing again until really February, so to say that I'm back, I don't know if I'm back or not, but I know that it felt well to play well this week again.
Q. Are you teaching history tomorrow in high school?
TODD WHITE: As long as I can change my flight, I will be in the classroom tomorrow morning at 8:00.
