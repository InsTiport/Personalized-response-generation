Q. Wow, your mom just told me that was the first birdie putt you made all day.  Is that accurate?
NATHAN SMITH: Yeah, yeah, probably.  I don't know how many I had, but that was a great match.  They played well, and what an incredible shot he hit in there.  I was just happy to help Todd out on the last couple.  I played really well earlier, and he was a one-man gang the last three or four, so I was glad to give him something there at the end.
Q. What do you think, Todd?  That was a pretty much back-and-forth match, even pretty much the whole time?
TODD WHITE: Yeah, so difficult to make birdies and get on any kind of run out there.  The golf course obviously plays difficult.  I was just happy to be able to spell Nathan a little bit there.  A great putt he hits on 18, and I'm just happy to be playing tomorrow.
Q. You had a great putt over on 17, too.  Just talk through that.
TODD WHITE: Well, it was a great second putt after an awful first putt.
NATHAN SMITH: That was an incredible putt.  It's so windy.
TODD WHITE: Yeah, into the green.  I don't hit it hard enough and leave myself four or five feet.  Not exactly what you want to halve a hole.  Managed to get it in there and turn the stage over to Nathan on 18.
