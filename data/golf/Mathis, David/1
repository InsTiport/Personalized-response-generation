Q.   Finished with two birdies, 12 points, total of 29.   Up you go.   And it's been not your best season.   So you need something to happen here, don't you?
DAVID MATHIS:   Oh, my gosh, it's been a frustrating year.   Physically I would say I've been as good as I've ever been.
But scoreâ€‘wise, it's probably the worst it's been in my career that I can recall.   But it is what it is.   It's not the end of the world for me.   It's not who I am; it's just kind of what I do.
So I'm thankful for a good week, thankful for things looking up.

Q.   Your caddie was telling me that you went to see Scotty Cameron in the studio and worked on your stroke and your putter and apparently it's paying dividends. 
DAVID MATHIS:   It was some good insight into basically what my coach has been saying for all along.   And it allowed me to kind of see and it give me some stuff to work on. 
It was a really good time over there.   I spent some time with TaylorMade as well that same week and working on my wedges.   And that's been a good thing this week, for sure.
