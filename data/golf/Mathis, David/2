 Q.   David, seven points today.   17 through two rounds.   Just talk about your play.   
DAVID MATHIS:   Wow, I played really solid yesterday.   Today, I felt like I played just as good, if not better, tee to green.   I just didn't hole as many putts.   
I had a stretch there through the middle of my round where I had a lot of looks and just didn't hole the putts.   But I played solid.   No complaints. The weather's awesome.   Good attitude.  
   
 Q.   Good thing.   You like this format?  
DAVID MATHIS:   This golf course is so perfect.   We laid up on 18 and the numbers we're trying to figure out with the elevation, the layup number, the percentage, like it just‑‑ with all that going on, it's a perfect venue for playing the Stableford.   It's really fun.  
   
 Q.   The last month or two you've really played really good golf, sort of turned your season around.   Maybe not quite as well on the weekends as you wanted, but still some good play.   
DAVID MATHIS:   Yeah, I've played considerably better.   I feel I've been nine holes away with having some really good finishes.   And Lord willing I can do it this weekend.  
Obviously my golf game has gotten a lot better but I'm running out of tournaments.   But it is what it is.   And I'll just take the good stuff and build on it and see what happens this weekend.  
   
 Q.   Lastly, what's working so well for you so far this week?  
DAVID MATHIS:   Surprisingly, we've been picking the numbers pretty good, the elevation percentages.   We've been hitting the ball the right distance, which is huge out here.   And I holed some nice putts yesterday especially; and, gosh, it's all about just avoiding the mistakes.
