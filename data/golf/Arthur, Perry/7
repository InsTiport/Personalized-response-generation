 Q. How do you feel about your round today?
 PERRY ARTHUR: Well, I feel very fortunate because at one point I thought it was going to be a lot higher than what it was. 

 Q. You finished great. You made a couple birdies on the back and played I think 1-under the last five holes. 
 PERRY ARTHUR: Yeah. I did. Like I said, I thought it was going to be a lot higher round than what it was. 
 I just tried to keep hanging in there.

 Q. How much of the weather was a factor?
 PERRY ARTHUR: Oh, I don't know if it was that much. I mean it was breezy, but with the rough the way it is, I mean it's just such a premium on putting it in the fairway and on the greens. 
 I didn't miss fairways by much, but it doesn't take much out here. 

 Q. Did you have a goal coming into this week? Was there something you were looking to get to?
 PERRY ARTHUR: I really didn't. Unfortunately, I hadn't been playing a whole lot back at home. Teaching and everything else. And just hadn't played enough coming into this as I would have liked. 
 So I didn't really have many expectations.
