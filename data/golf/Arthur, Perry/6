  Q. How did it go today? Do you feel good about it?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: Yeah, I made some dumb mistakes, but overall I'm not going to complain.  
  
  Q. How do you compare the conditions today from yesterday?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: Well, this morning is a lot calmer. The wind wasn't really as bad as it was yesterday. And you could, it was a little more playable.   
  
  Q. They're projecting the cut at maybe 11-over. You're in good shape. Are you looking forward to the weekend?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: I don't know if I'm ready to play this golf course two more days, but we'll see what happens.
