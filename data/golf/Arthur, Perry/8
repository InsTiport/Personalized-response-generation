Q.  Pretty good round today.  You held it together with some difficult conditions out there.
PERRY ARTHUR:  Well, I got off to a good start on the back nine.  I birdied 15 and eagled 16.  And I bogeyed 18.  I made the turn at 2 under.

And I just shot 3 over on the front side and just kind of got worn out.
Q.  Special recollections?  I'm sure you feel that at the end of the tournament on such an upswing here, ending it that way, so what are you going to take away from this tournament as to your memories?
PERRY ARTHUR:  Well, being an a club pro, coming to a tournament like this, the first priority is wanting to make the cut, which I achieved.  And that's going to carry me further down the road as I go to the National Club Pro in June and other tournaments down the road.
Q.  Most of these guys will continue next week on somewhere else, what's your job on Monday going to be like?
PERRY ARTHUR:  I'm going back to the club to work there.  I got lots of paperwork there.  There will be stuff to do, yeah.
