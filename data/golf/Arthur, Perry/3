 Q. Talk about your round briefly, you got off to a good start. 
 PERRY ARTHUR: I birdied 11 and then bogeyed 13 and birdied 14 and 15. I bogeyed 17. Made the turn at 1-under, playing the harder of the two nines, I was feeling pretty good. 
 And then hit a tee shot on one and all the markers down there said, yeah, we saw it hit right here. Never found the ball. So I had to go back and made par from there, but that's a double bogey. 
 And I made a couple more bogeys coming in and no birdies. So for this tough of golf course, I'm not too disappointed, but.

 Q. Heading into tomorrow what's your mindset tomorrow?
 PERRY ARTHUR: Well, I'm just going to start out thinking I'm even par for the day and try to keep it around even par. That's not a bad score around this golf course.
