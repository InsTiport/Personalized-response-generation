 Q. Talk about the ups and downs that you've been through. 
 PERRY ARTHUR: Well, the downs are pretty easy. You hit it in the rough, it's pretty, it puts you in a down mood. 
 That rough is brutal, man. You get into it, you'll be there all day.

 Q. What's the main strategy as far as, I saw you had a couple birdies on the scorecard, what were some of your strategies going into those holes?
 PERRY ARTHUR: Just get it in the fairway. That's the big key out here. Get it in the fairway. And when you've done that, get it on the green. Leave yourself a chance for a good putt.

 Q. What do you need to do tomorrow?
 PERRY ARTHUR: Same thing. Just find the fairway, find the greens, and hit the putter as few times as possible.
