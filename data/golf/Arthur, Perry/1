 Q. How is it?
 PERRY ARTHUR: It's wet. Very wet. And then this morning it was cold and drizzly and tougher conditions. 

 Q. Tougher conditions than yesterday?
 PERRY ARTHUR: Yeah. Yeah. Very much so. 

 Q. Can you give us an overview of your first round?
 PERRY ARTHUR: Ten holes yesterday was good, the eight holes this morning were not good. 
 I don't know, maybe it was the cool weather and the drizzling rain got to me or something. But it was not quite the same as yesterday. But that's golf.
