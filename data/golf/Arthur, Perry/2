  Q. Talk about round two today.   
 PERRY ARTHUR: A little too hilly. I was looking for a cart all the way around and couldn't find one.   
 No, the wind was about the same, maybe a little bit stronger today, but it seemed like it slowed the greens up a little bit and if you could hit the shots, you could score. And I didn't do that.   
  
  Q. Was there any difference between yesterday and today for you or pretty much the same?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: Pretty much the same. I just hit the irons bad all week and just continued on.   
  
  Q. What can you take away from the Colorado Golf Club?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: Well, I tell you what, it will teach you how to play golf, that's for sure. I mean you got to execute the shots and I didn't hit them. It's as simple as that.
