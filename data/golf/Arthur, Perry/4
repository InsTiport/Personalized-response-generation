  Q. Who you did you play today?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: I shot 75, which that's probably about 2- or 3-under par for me.   
  
  Q. So what are your impressions on playing as such a prestigious course as Oak Hill?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: I loved it. It was tough and you had to play good golf to score well and that means hitting the ball in the right places. And the course is a Major Championship. And that's the way it ought to be.  
  
  Q. How has the course changed over the last couple days, it's sunny and warm today, how has that affected your game?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: The last couple days have been a little more playable than the first two. The wind's laid down a little bit. It's made it a little bit easier, but I wouldn't say a whole lot easier.  
  
  Q. What do you take away from a Major Championship like this?  
 PERRY ARTHUR: As we get older you don't know how many more of these you're going to be able to get in, especially as a club pro. So I just savor the experience every time and hopefully this isn't the last one.
