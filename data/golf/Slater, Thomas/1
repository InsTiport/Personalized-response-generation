Q.You almost didn't tee off to get where you are now.
 
THOMAS SLATER:  Well, yesterday afternoon, after playing the 14th hole, I just felt very weak, and I was just ready to collapse.  I've had a cold for a couple of weeks.  And fortunately there was an EMT person there.  I said to him, "I really don't feel well."  So he took me by the arm and said, "Maybe we ought to take a look at you."  And after about an hour and a half in the trailer, they gave me two liters of saline and some other things.  I started to feel better. 
 
Q.This was what time yesterday?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  I don't know.  Noontime.  I don't remember.  So they kept me for quite awhile.  I went back to the hotel and let the USGA know that I might not be a starter for the morning.  This morning I decided, let's give it a shot.  I felt well enough.  And my son who is caddying for me kept saying, "Come on, we can do it, we can do it."  He was right. 
 
Q.What is your son's name?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  Hugh. 
 
Q.Did you have trepidation about it?  Did the EMT's tell you it might not be advisable?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  No.  They said there was no medical reason that -- pure medical reason I couldn't go.  But if I didn't feel well, they didn't think I should go. 
 
Q.This is basically because you had a cold leading up to this?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  I think so.  It was pretty hot yesterday. It was a good break that I had a 7:15 tee off time.  I called the USGA this morning at about 6 and said, "If you have an alternate available, you'd better have them ready".  Because at 6:00 I was in my room and pretty dizzy. 
 
Q.Given all this history of the last 24 hours, how do you get it under?  You had quite a round going?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  I did, but I started leaking oil at the end, didn't I?  Right at the 15th tee I said to my son, "Do you have any more bananas?  Do we have anything else?"  We were out of food. I had gone through the bananas.  So I was starting to feel pretty shaky there.  Unfortunately, I missed the short putt back here. 
 
Q.Do you attribute the bogeys coming in to just winding down?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  I was tired.  A little nervous. 
 
Q.How do you feel right now?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  I'm going to go back to my hotel and lie down.  I've got some antibiotics I'm going to start taking again. 
 
Q.How did you make those bogeys coming in?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  Well, I missed about a two and a half-footer on 18, 3-putted 17.  16 -- 
 
Q.One putted --
 
THOMAS SLATER:  Yeah.  On 16 I made about a four and a half foot downhill for bogey on 16.  And 15 I just was short of the green.  15 is a very good par-3.  Chipped it too strong and didn't make the putt. 
 
Q.How many of these have you played in?  Is this the first one of these you've played in?  How many of these have you played in?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  This is the first Senior Open I've tried to qualify for.  I've played in two Senior, United States Seniors.  
 
Q.Senior Amateurs?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  Yeah. 
 
Q.How come this is the first one you tried to qualify for?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  I didn't think about it.  I'm still working for a living.  I just thought this year I'd give it a little harder push before I get too old.

Q.What did you think of the golf course?
 
THOMAS SLATER:  It's a great golf course.
