Q.  Talk about the way, you know, to win in front of all these kind of fans, what kind of feeling is this?
LAURA DIAZ:  It's great.  I felt really bad yesterday because I hadn't done anything to help the team out.  It just feels good to come out and make some birdies and get a point on the board, because we believe, we believe red, white and blue, and we've got to get a lot of red up there, not blue.
Q.  Talk about the start, you seemed to keep on going.
LAURA DIAZ:  I have no idea, you know, I have been feeling pretty bad after the few losses that I had, and Meg got up last night and spoke to the team and brought me up there, you know, and said really nice things, and she didn't need to do that, and that made me feel really good.

Like I said, at least I could go out and give it everything I had.
Q.  Congratulations.
LAURA DIAZ:  Thank you.
