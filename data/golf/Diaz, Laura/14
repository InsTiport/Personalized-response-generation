 Q. Talk about your eagle. 
 LAURA DIAZ: I hit a good drive and hit 7-wood in and rolled up to seven feet and made the putt. 
 The course is in really good shape. This is my third year here, and this is the greenest I've ever seen it. Because it's so green, it's a lot softer, so it's playing a lot different than it has in the past, but this is the first afternoon I've played and it's already starting to firm up. 
 Still playing not too far into the green and letting the ball release. 

 Q. Just talk about how it is coming here this year in general. 
 LAURA DIAZ: I've been coming here since '98, my European year, I guess it was '97 I played on the European Tour, '97 my first British Open, and I loved it. It was a great challenge. And it was very mentally demanding and recently I've struggled with my mental game.

 Q. Do you have a new coach? 
 LAURA DIAZ: I don't have a new coach. I started working with -- or I just spoke with Pia Nilsson and Lynn Marriott, yesterday, just feeling a little off. They have kind of always had my curiosity. My father and my brother have always said go out and shoot -- try and make 18 birdies, so I spoke with them yesterday and we had a good chat.
