  Q. You had a great round, some great putts. What was going on, the hole look like a basketball hoop?   
 LAURA DIAZ: Oh, no. I wish. No, I've been working a little on my putting and made a little change on my putting with my shoulders, and really just staying in the present. Because when I start off not so great, I tend to start thinking about the next hole, and the next hole and the next hole. So I just really tried to stay in the now.  
  
  Q. How has this course been for you? What are the keys to doing so well?   
 LAURA DIAZ: I think the greens are in really good shape. I think unfortunately in the last cup of years we've had it really wet. We've had some bad storms.   
 But I think without the rain it's been a little firmer, so the footprints aren't showing up as well. I also played very early, so I only had a come groups in front of me.  
  
  Q. Compared to Europe, how different is it from the rest of the schedule at this point in the season?   
 LAURA DIAZ: I don't really think these two weeks is that different for me. I played the European Tour. I was lucky enough to play both of these events on the European Tour. And I feel extremely comfortable here and the British as well.   
 But, you know, golf is one of those games that you've just got to take what you get and try to make the best of it.  
  
  Q. Are you looking forward to tomorrow?   
 LAURA DIAZ: Yes, of course. I'm happy to be here. My son injured my right ribs last Saturday, and I was forced to withdraw from the Jeamie Farr event.   
 So we took a whole week. We didn't hit balls until we got here, so I wasn't sure I was even going to be able to play. So I'm very happy.
