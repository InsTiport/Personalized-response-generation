LAURA DIAZ:   No.  2, I made like a 50-footer.  I hit a little 8-iron into the green and then a 6-footer.  No. 3, I hit the hole in two with my 3-wood.  2-putted from about 15 feet for 4.  On 8, I hit it about three feet, after hitting behind a tree and hit a little punch 3-iron down on to the green.  11, I made about a 9-footer.  Hit wedge into the green.  15, I hit the green in two with an 8-iron from about 20 feet.  2-putted for 4.  17, hit 9-iron over the green and didn't get it up-and-down.  Missed about a 12-footer.  18, I chipped it to nine feet and made the putt, with a sand wedge. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   I was upset because I made a bogey, not because of anything else.  I just don't like to not get it up-and-down.  But other than that, you know, just move on. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   There's no way  -- I gave it everything that I possibly had, made some putts from nowhere  -- (inaudible) -- I'd be here saying I played a really good game this week. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   David is a good friend of mine, so  -- a good friend of the family.  I just saw him before I left home  -- (inaudible).  

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   Yeah, I hit a perfect shot, I thought.  Landed i way in the front of the green, and just I had no spin on it because it was in the rough.  But it was the right club. 

Q.  (Inaudible.) 

LAURA DIAZ:   Well, I didn't really know anything about Rosie, to be honest with you.  The only thing I knew was that Cristie was at 10-under, as well.  I was just focusing on where to hit my tee shot and play one shot at a time. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   I still don't know anything on the putt.  I had not looked at the board yet.  So when I made it, I was just happy, because I knew that that put me to 11, and I knew that that had to have been pretty good, because of the feedback from the gallery.  And then I looked at the board.  So then there was a lot of emotion.  But, you know, I mean, 18 is a hole that a lot of people make birdie on; Rosie did it. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   That's my strategy every day.  Correct. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   I just think at any event, to have my friends and family out is, you know, a huge support system.  To have my dad here is great.  Having my sister, she's seen me come in second twice now; she's been with me.  I wish my husband had been here, but it's great to hear the cheers from someone  -- people who love you.  It makes a little bit of a difference. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   It's a pretty good gallery.  But McDonald's was a really big gallery.  There was only a few people who knew me, but there was a lot of people. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LAURA DIAZ:   I feel like I've broken through.  I don't think I have to do anything  -- just keep putting myself where I put myself and shoot low numbers.  I mean, I shot 11-under today.  I can't  -- I didn't win the golf tournament, but, I mean, I played good golf, and that's all I can do.  I am playing next week.
