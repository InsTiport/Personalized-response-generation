LAURA DIAZ:  You know, just trying to go as low as I could, and make a lot of putts.  I hadn't been putting very well this week.  And so it felt good to have some putts drop right away. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  No. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  I don't know, but I'm going to guess three, maybe four, but never six. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  No, it was just blowing.  Even the next putt that I had almost went in, the next putt almost went in.  And then next hole I had to get it up-and-down.  So it was really coming off my putter really well at that time and it was nice.  It hadn't felt that way all week. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  They were long.  Yeah.  Probably 35 to 40 on seven.  And 40 to 45 on eight.  Yeah, I knocked them up there about to probably a foot. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  I can't find anything really good about it right now.  I'm trying really hard.  No, it was a good last day and I got it to 3-under in the beginning of the first round on Thursday.  And felt like I had finally played my way back there going into today's round.  So definitely 67 any time is a good score and I'm finishing strong.  Unfortunately in the middle of the round I made two bogeys, so that's a little upsetting.  And that I didn't get the putt to the hole on the last hole, that's not real comforting either.  But 8-under, the British, pretty happy with that. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  I don't know.  I think I'm comfortable over here, playing over here for a year.  Wasn't really a year, but my rookie year as a professional.  I'm comfortable over here.  The fans are very welcoming.  I love the courses.  And I get lucky. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  I just have liked every course that we have played at the British.  I think because they're demanding.  You can't look away ever.  You have to always be focused on what you're doing.  I think it just requires a lot more thought.  And that's what I need.  I need something to keep me focused.  I need precise targets.  And that's what I get here. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  First hole, I hit it in the bunker, so I got it up-and-down.  I made about a 9-footer for birdie. Second hole I got it up-and-down again.  I made about a 20-footer for birdie after hitting a chip shot in.  Third hole I hit a sand wedge to about seven feet.  Made the putt.  Fourth hole, hit seven iron, got a lucky kick.  Ended up about a foot.  Tapped that in.  Fifth hole, hit a punch 5-iron, not very close, probably 25 feet.  Knocked that in.  Sixth hole, hit 5-iron again to about 15 feet.  Knocked that in.  On 10 I got it up-and-down out of a bunker.  Hit it to about three feet.  And that was the last of my birdies.  
 
LAURA DIAZ:  Oh, unfortunately. 
 
LAURA DIAZ:  14, I 3-putted after hitting wedge in.  It was like 123 yards out.  And -- 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  About 50 feet.  And 16 I didn't get it up-and-down after hitting 4-iron right.  And I chipped with my sand wedge to about five feet and missed the putt. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  Yeah.  It kicked left.  It was in the heather.  But I was okay.  I hit a 9-iron out and I was clear, I was in the fairway for my approach.  It was just a "not comfortable over it" shot, really, unfortunately. 
 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  No, she didn't.  Her caddy did.  When I made a par.  He was like, what are you doing making a par?  But that was about it.  She was playing well herself, so. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  I finished sixth here last year and it was a similar situation.  Every one was kind of up at the top of the board.  Very similar.  I played pretty well at Woburn, maybe top 20, I think.  14th?  And I didn't play well at Lytham, but it was a great experience.  And I'm very much looking forward to going back. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
LAURA DIAZ:  Thank you.
