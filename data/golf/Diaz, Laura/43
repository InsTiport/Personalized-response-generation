JULI INKSTER:  It was really great.  After Friday I was really down and came back and played well.  It looks like you are making a comeback but it looks like it's going to come down to the wire.  
Q.  Are you going to hide?
JULI INKSTER:  I am going to head out there and root for the Americans.  So anybody out there, I am going to root for Laura coming in.  And go out and catch the last two matches.

Q.  Congratulations.
JULI INKSTER:  Thanks. 

Q.  You were ahead all the way.  Tell me about the match. 
JULI INKSTER:  I played better coming in, but, you know, I made some good putts on the back side and Patty sent me out there, I knew, to try to get that one point early and I am glad I could come through for her.




PAULA MARTI


PAULA MARTI:  I don't know, I tried to hole it out there on the back 9.  I was doing pretty good.  I was 2 under  playing this hole, but I never gave it up until this, but, I mean, the way I played the front 9, you know, the wind  --

Q.  How do you feel that the conditions affected your play out here today?
PAULA MARTI:  I mean, I don't think it was the conditions.  I am glad I was just out here.  


LAURA DIAZ

Q.  We noticed after the fifth hole that you just kicked it into gear.  Can you tell us a little bit about that.
LAURA DIAZ:  No, I just stuck with my game plan and went out and tried to make as many birdies as I could, just like when I am playing every other week.

Q.  Did you notice if the weather made any difference this morning, as far as the coolness and the wind? 
LAURA DIAZ:  I don't think so.

Q.  How about Interlachen, any comments? 
LAURA DIAZ:  Great golf club. 

Q.  Thank you.
