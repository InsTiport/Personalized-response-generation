 Q.  6-under par heading into the weekend.  How does it feel?  What was working well for you today?  
LAURA DIAZ: I don't know.  I mean, I'm just trying to have fun.  I putted pretty well.  Got it up and down a few times when I missed the green.   
Then I had some good looks at birdie.  Shorter, closer to the hole.  So that always helps.   
 Q.  How was the course playing this morning compared to yesterday afternoon?  
LAURA DIAZ: A lot softer.  Yesterday afternoon everything was just bouncing onto the greens, which is expected to a degree.   
So of course I came out thinking it would still be bouncing a little bit because it's just getting hotter.  They really received the ball different today.  The course is in great shape.   
This is my Top five courses that we play.  It's just such a peaceful walk out there.  Just makes it so enjoyable to come here.   
 Q.  Seems like you've been finding yourself near the top of the leaderboard frequently as of late.  
LAURA DIAZ: Well, I wouldn't say that, even though I've made some cuts.   
No, I mean, I think life is so different for me now.  Obviously great to play well.  That's fun.   
But I think looking at it a little different than I used to.  I would say I don't do it to make a living anymore.  My husband is working for Wheels Up and he's kind of taken on this job of providing for us.   
It's more about getting out and enjoying myself, and I think I struggled with that the last few years.  A little more relaxed I would say.  I've got one of my closest, dearest friends caddying for me.  I said to him, I just want to have fun.  That's all I want to do.  Just keep me loose, let's laugh a lot, and go see what happens.
