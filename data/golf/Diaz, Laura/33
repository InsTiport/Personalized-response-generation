PAUL ROVNAK:  How tough were the weather conditions today?
LAURA DIAZ:  Extremely tough for me.  The wind was blowing 20 to 30.  You know, I was adding 20 yards to every shot that I hit into the green, and then obviously the rain was just kind of tricky.
Q.  Were you miserable out there?  How do you deal with it?
LAURA DIAZ:  I think the only way you deal with it is just saying to your caddie or your caddie saying to you, "Everyone is playing in it, everyone is dealing with it."  That is really the only way to go about dealing with it.

I think most of us felt like we shouldn't have played, and obviously in the end officials agreed with us, with the wash of a round.
Q.  Some of the scores, people were backing up, but you were playing well.
LAURA DIAZ:  
Yeah.  When I heard they were considering it, you know, I guess I have mixed feelings.  I feel for the people who were out there and it wasn't going their way.  It was a miserable day, plain and simple.  Lucky for me, it was neither here nor there in that I didn't change position.  I was even par when they called it.

It is just hard because you have worked hard for those five holes, and luckily for me it was only five holes.  For people who it was more than that, I am sure there is people who feel like the round shouldn't have been washed and I'm sure there are people who are really happy it was washed.  In the end it will all even out.  You know, you go with the decision and battle tomorrow.
Q.  
Then tomorrow everybody starts all over?
LAURA DIAZ:  
Right.
Q.  
What is your plan?  Do you completely forget about today and everything?
LAURA DIAZ:  
Yeah, I think you do.  I think that you just go into tomorrow like it was tomorrow and forget about what happened today, and go with it as best you can.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you, Laura.
LAURA DIAZ:  Thank you.
