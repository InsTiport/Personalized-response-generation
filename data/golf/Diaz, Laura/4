 Q.  You've been playing very well the last couple of days.  Talk about today's round.  
LAURA DIAZ: Let's see.  Got off to a good start, but then I kind of slowed down on the back.  I hit a lot of good shots on my back side, which was the front side, but I wasn't making any putts.  I made a nice six-footer for par on the last.   
It was a good day, solid.  Hit it well almost all day and didn't give myself the opportunity on 7, the par-5, that I would have liked, but other than that, I was steady, I just didn't make a lot of putts after I made the putt on 1.   
 Q.  Are you looking at the leaderboard at all when you're out there?  
LAURA DIAZ: No, no.  You know, I've struggled -- 2015 was a disaster, to put it mildly, and I walked away.  Didn't know what I was going to do, and then I broke my leg, so I thought that was God's way of saying take some time off.  So now I'm in a little bit different of a place and just going out and trying to play the best golf I can.  So no, leaderboard is not in my eyesight at all, not that it's not in everybody who's pinging me on my phone, but it's great to be able to just go out and shoot 67-67.  I haven't done that in a long time, so that feels good.  I'm just going to focus on that.   
 Q.  It looked like at the end there, was it relief, hugs from your caddie?  What was the emotion going on at the end there?  
LAURA DIAZ: Yeah, well, you know, '15 was hard, and I think I put a lot of expectations on myself.  Susan is new to our family, but she suffered through those two years.  Just hearing about it, I think it's hard to have played well and then struggle.  Tears of joy for sure, but you know, you definitely go out on Friday thinking, I want to go low and I want to just stay there, and so it was nice to be able to do that.
