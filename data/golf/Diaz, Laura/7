  LAURA DIAZ:   I had a couple one‑putts.  
   
 Q.   Three in a row there, 6 through 8?  
LAURA DIAZ:   Yeah, I guess so.   Didn't really think about it.   Yeah, I had a lot of opportunities all day, but they were breaking away at the hole or just missing.   
So I got one to drop on 3, I think, and then it kind of, you know, opened up a little bit.  
   
 Q.   How big was that to save par on the final hole?  
LAURA DIAZ:   Oh, it's great.   I mean I always like to get the lowest number that I can.   And I struggled a little with that tee shot.   So getting it up‑and‑down always makes me feel better.  
   
 Q.   You've been playing some really good golf recently.   What do you attribute that to?  
LAURA DIAZ:   I've really just been working on staying really present and trying to enjoy myself out there.   The last four years have been rough, and just not enjoyable.   
And I'm trying to really just embrace what's going on, and I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to play on the LPGA Tour, and I think that sometimes you get to a point where you're like, I'm not playing good enough, and then you're miserable, instead of hundreds of thousands of people would love to do what I do, and sometimes it's really hard to put that in perspective, so I'm working really hard to do that.
