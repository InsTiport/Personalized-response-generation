  Q.  Just talk about your round, how did you feel and how were the conditions?   
 LAURA DIAZ:  Well, I hit it good and I didn't make any putts, but I was able to get it up-and-down when I needed to.  So the putts saved me.   
  
  Q.  So with match play, how do you feel about it?  Do you go in with any different strategy this weekend?   
 LAURA DIAZ:  No.  I just keep working on my putting.   
  
  Q.  How did the rain affect the conditions from early in the week?   
 LAURA DIAZ:  I think the course dried out nicely.  I didn't get to play yesterday in the afternoon because I played in the morning Pro-Am.  I didn't think it was all that dry or all that wet.  I just thought it was pretty similar to what it was playing the day before in the practice round.  The new drainage system I think must be working.
