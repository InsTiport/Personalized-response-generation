DANA VON LOUDA:  65 today and you are tied with Heather Bowie at 12 under for the lead.  You must be happy with this position going into the final round.
RACHEL TESKE:   Yeah, I'm.  I'm very happy.  I guess I have been close to putting a round like this together and not really finishing it off.  I guess all week I've been hitting the ball really solid and putting really well.  Today I just played really solid and got off to a great start on the front nine and played solid coming in.

The second hole, I hit a chip on the front of the green to a foot for birdie.

On the sixth hole I hit 5 iron to 12 feet, one putt for birdie.  8, 6 iron to 10 feet.

9, I hit a driver on the green to 15 feet for eagle.

17, I hit a 5 iron to I guess 18 feet for birdie.

On 18, I hit an 8 iron to probably ten feet for birdie.
Q.  YouÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve said youÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve been close all year long, what has kept you from going low?
RACHEL TESKE:   I think it's been    not putting it that well.  I think I've been hitting the ball fairly solid all year, not really putting well, but just making mistakes.  I think hitting poor shots somewhere along the line and not chipping as well, not really being as consistent as I needed to be, I guess and then the putting has let me down.

But I've been putting better.  I went back to one of my favorite putters that I've used over the years, the Odyssey White Hot No.  2 and.  At the Evian Masters, I just kind of felt like this might feel good again, so I brought it out.  And I started to roll the ball on the fairway, and that's carried on this week.
Q.  What did you have before?
RACHEL TESKE:   I had a Callaway TT3, a little mallet putter, I guess you could call it.
Q.  What do you think accounts for the scoring today?
RACHEL TESKE:   Well, you know, it's great weather and the course is in great condition.  You've got a few par 5s that are reachable and a couple short par 4s, and then you've got a mixture of some long par 4s and tough par 3s, as well, but the par 5s are definitely a key.  I think on the front nine, too, they get them up to a good start.  Everybody is just playing a little bit better.
Q.  How will you go into tomorrow?
RACHEL TESKE:   Yeah, one myself     really, just going to be determined and doing a good job on the golf course.  Hitting fairways is definitely a priority, and started working harder on that last week, as well, and I'll continue this week.

So to get a good score on the greens and see the lines.  Yeah, just play my way around the golf course.
Q.  How many putters do you carry with you?
RACHEL TESKE:   Usually I travel with two or three.  International travel, I've had to cut back, but yeah, just two this trip, but two or three, easily.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Thank you.
