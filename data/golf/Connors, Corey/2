Q. You have to be really proud of yourself.
COREY CONNORS: Yeah, definitely.  Played really steady all day.  Yeah, capitalized on some chances; putted really well; had some good saves to keep me in it.
Yeah, a lot of credit to Cam.  He played really great today and finished off really strong.  But definitely proud of how I played.  Yeah, definitely lots to build off of.
Q. If there was a turning point in the match, maybe the eagle putt on 15.  I thought you hit a good putt.
COREY CONNORS: Yeah, I really I hit a good putt.  There is a lot slope around that hole.  Definitely wanted to make that one.  Knew if I made that one it would give me a lot of momentum going into the last three holes.  Yeah, just slid by.
I would say maybe that was a turning point.  Cam made an awesome birdie; we ended up tying that hole, and he kept his lead and 16 buried a long putt on me.
Yeah, overall it was a fun day.
