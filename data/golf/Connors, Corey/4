Q. What an inward nine for you:  You shoot 29; 6 birdies; bogey-free.  Tell me about that inward nine.
COREY CONNORS: Yeah, it was great.  I really had the putter rolling.  Gave myself a nice look on 10 to get it started and rolled it in.
Two nice sand saves on 11 and 12 kind of short-sided to save pars, and then a few birdies in a row.  Hit a few quality shots, and when I was just off with an iron shot I rolled in nice putts.
So, yeah, made it pretty easy and it was a lot of fun.
Q. It's a pleasure to talk to you.  I can see the excitement still on your face.  Good for you.  It's been a solid season for you, I think 127 in the FedExCup.  How do you approach the second half of the season?
COREY CONNORS: Yeah, just keep doing what I've been doing.  I learned a lot in, I guess, the first half of the season.  Played well; haven't been able to get four rounds together, but happy with where my game is at what the way that it's trending.
So just trying to keep working hard, and, yeah, keep giving myself as many chances as possible.
Happy to have started well this week.
