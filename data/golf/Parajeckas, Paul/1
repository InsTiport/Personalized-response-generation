Q.  How was practice for you today?
PAUL PARAJECKAS:  The practice round was great.  We played early in the morning and at 8 o'clock we beat the heat and the golf course was incredible, great.
Q.  Are you feel pretty confident going into the tournament?
PAUL PARAJECKAS:  Yeah, actually I'm from the Boston area and it's been raining there for the last month, so I'm a little rusty.  But hopefully tomorrow we'll, and this week, the Russ will come off the clubs and I believe that I'm ready.  I'm as ready as I can be.
