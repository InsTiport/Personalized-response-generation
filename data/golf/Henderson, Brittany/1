Q.   What's it like to be on the bag for her this week after she was on the bag for you last week?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   It's pretty cool.   I mean, yeah, we have the reciprocal caddy agreement.   So we like to exchange favors, I goes.

Q.   She said y'all don't charge each other either. 
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   No.   No.   Might have to start, but‑‑ no, just kidding.
No.   She bought me dinner and stuff like that, but it's good because like I said, it's probably pretty even the amount we caddy for each other, so it works out.

Q.   She said that it helps her on the golf course to caddy for you because she has to think about the shots and where she'd hit it and stuff.   Is it the same for you out there?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Yeah, for sure.   It definitely I think helps your mental game because you're thinking, okay, what would I do in this situation and planning it out.   And then once you actually get to the course and are the one executing the shot, you have already kind of visualized it.

Q.   Right.   How do the thought processes differ?   Is one of you more aggressive thought process wise on shots or anything?   Are you all any different out on the course?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Maybe a little bit.   She tends to take a little bit more aggressive lines than I do typically, and she usually is able to execute the shot, so it works out.

Q.   Do you all influence each other at all shot wise or do you just say go for it, whatever line you want to take?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   We talk about it, and especially if it's wind, if it's windy out there, definitely have to discuss how we think that's going to come into play.   But yeah, we definitely talk about the lie and then decide on something.

Q.   Both having good years, too.   Is that pretty neat for you to see?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Yeah, it's awesome.   I'm really excited to be playing next week with Brooke in the Manulife LPGA.   So really excited for that.

Q.   Have you all ever played in an LPGA event together before?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   No.

Q.   No?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   First one.

Q.   First time?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Yeah.

Q.   So who's going to caddy for both of y'all next week?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   We got a couple of guys lined up.   We're still deciding who's going to be on whose bag.

Q.   Is Brian going to be on one of the bags?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Yeah, and my dad probably on the other bag.   So we're still deciding. 

Q.   I think it's the support, too, in Canada.   I mean I know that's going to be pretty crazy next week, Canadian Women's Open.   Brooke had bigger crowds last year than a lot of the big stars on tour at times?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Yeah.   I think it's going to be awesome.   And I can't wait for I guess people from my hometown probably to come and watch and be there and to have support.   It's going to be awesome.   I can't imagine a better, I guess, debut for me on the LPGA, and the support for both of us is awesome.

Q.   And how has your year been out on the Symetra tour?   Do you feel like you're pretty prepared heading into next week?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Yeah.   Yeah.   I think so.   It's similar out there just in what you have to do, and the competition is high at both levels.

Q.   Right. 
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   So I think just knowing I have to shoot under par and getting it down there, and it's really helped me this year.

Q.   When you two are caddying, how much do you get to practice that week?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Not too much, but hopefully enough. 

Q.   Hopefully enough?
BRITTANY HENDERSON:   Yeah.
