 Q.  What club was that into 12 for that hole-in-one?  
THOMAS PIETERS: It was a 6-iron, and I had the same number before, so knew how hard I had to hit it and went in.  Pretty lucky, but it was my first one in a tournament.   
 Q.  How was the week itself?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Not great and not bad.  Obviously the 8-under, really helped my score, but other than that, three days, I just kind of struggled on the greens.  Ball-striking wasn't what I wanted it to be, but you know, Top-20, I'm not going to complain.
