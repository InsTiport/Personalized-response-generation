 Q.  A case of just not getting going?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, my driving was very poor.  I think I hit one fairway with an iron and that's it.  I can't say much more than that.  I fought really hard.  I made some really good up-and-downs.   
 Q.  He's a real tough competitor, isn't he?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, he played well.  He shot 2-under in the morning, and starting out on the back nine, which is a tougher one, starting on 10 with 3-iron into the green which is a tough hole to start on but yeah, he played good so he beat me.   
 Q.  Just a word on the crowds.  How appreciative are you of them coming out this morning, because it was pretty cold, wasn't it?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, very.  It was great to see that many kids on the weekend, as well.  I was a bit sad and disappointed obviously coming down the last, but hopefully have a good day and I've heard nothing but good stuff about the tournament, so I'm happy.   
 Q.  What can you take on and off the golf course from this tournament?  
THOMAS PIETERS: I think it's been run very well.  We've had a lot of positives, like I said, positive feedback.  I've played pretty well myself.  Just off of the tee was very poor today.  Pretty happy going into next week.  Obviously I didn't make it very far in the match play, but that's how it goes.   
 Q.  Are you making small steps with your golf?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, the round yesterday was good for my confidence to see some putts go in.  I putted pretty well today, as well.  So yeah, confidence-wise, it's there.
