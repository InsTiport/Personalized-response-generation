 Q.  You were just talking about what it's like to compete in something like this; how do you describe it to an audience who will never understand what it's like inside the ropes?  
RORY McILROY: It's incredible.  I mean, I think for me, I've played one Ryder Cup in the US and this is the second one, and this is definitely a little more hostile than the one at Medinah.   
I just want to -- reactions like that on the last, I just want to let people know how much it means to us.  This guy beside me all day was absolutely incredible.  It's his first Ryder Cup and he played so well.  A lot of credit has to go to Thomas, as well.   
 Q.  We talked to Brooks Koepka about the same thing, first time in a Ryder Cup, having to wait in the morning to play in the afternoon.  What was that like --  
RORY McILROY: He played in the morning.   
 Q.  What was it like for you to play again in the afternoon, opposite of what Brooks did?  
THOMAS PIETERS: It was nice to get a round under my belt.  This morning was not what we wanted but I think we redeemed ourselves pretty well this afternoon and can't wait to get out there tomorrow.
