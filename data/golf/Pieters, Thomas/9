 Q.  A round of 69 today, good shape heading into the final round.  Tell us how good 69 is today compared to the first couple of rounds.  
THOMAS PIETERS: As you can see, the wind makes it a bit trickier today and some of the pin positions are quite tough, close to the edges.  But yeah, I'm happy.  I putted a lot better at the start of the round than the last few days.  Disappointed with my finish, but still a good day overall?   
 Q.  Yourself and Brooks Koepka playing together, both playing really nice, solid golf.  Is there an element of getting pulled along with a playing partner in a two-ball like that, especially with a good one like you were?  
THOMAS PIETERS: It's always fun to play with good players and the people are cheering you on.  Hopefully tomorrow I get a good pairing, as well, and I can make some birdies.   
 Q.  Tell me about your off-season.  We've come here and we've talked about players putting in a few weeks of work, but it's been snowboarding and skiing for you and you put a week in of work.  Do you feel fresher, or the time off was needed?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Time off was needed and a couple weeks of snowboarding, and I was just here on Saturday, so not that much practise, but not that rusty, or not yet maybe or it's been knocked off.  We'll see tomorrow.  I'm just happy to be in this position.   
 Q.  Do you think this is the sort of golf course where you've still got a sniff tomorrow?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I think so.  There's a lot of birdies out there.  I think it's going to blow a lot.  Might need some help but you never know.
