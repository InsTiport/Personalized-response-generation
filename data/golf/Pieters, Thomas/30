Q. A great way to start the tournament, a 66, that's your lowest round on this golf course.
THOMAS PIETERS: If you say so, yeah.  I've done decent at this tournament in the past.  Off to a good start and I like where my game's at.  Done some work on my putting just this past week and it's paid off.
Q. What's the most positive thing you take out of today's round?
THOMAS PIETERS: Oh, my putting, for sure.  I haven't been making those 10-footers, ten to 15.  I made a couple nice ones today, so that was nice.
Q. Course looked in immaculate condition.  Is this possibly the best you've seen it here?
THOMAS PIETERS: Every year it's great.  I don't want to say it the best ever but it's definitely in very good shape.
Q. You made a good start at Wentworth in the Rolex Series, tied 14th.  How important would it be for you to have another good finish here this week?
THOMAS PIETERS: We'll see on Sunday.
Q. This is a course that can, as you know yourself, it can bite you if you don't pay full attention throughout the 18 holes.
THOMAS PIETERS: Of course.  You have to be spot on, 18 holes in a row.  It's thick rough verus out-of-bounds and you have to be spot on all day long.
