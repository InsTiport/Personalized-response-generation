Q. Round of the week so far, so how did you manage that today?
THOMAS PIETERS: I had to stay patient all week.  I've been playing really well and first week in ages, couldn't get the putts to drop or made a stupid double here and there.  Yeah, today, it all came together.  Very happy with that.
Q. You have played some terrific rounds of golf in your young career, so how does this compare with the best of them?
THOMAS PIETERS: Top-10 maybe.
Q. It's a lovely feeling, though, presumably, to see your name just climbing steadily up that board and now to be right in the mix.
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I mean, I wasn't expecting to have a chance for it tomorrow, being ten back going into the weekend, but definitely have a chance tomorrow now.  Hopefully make the best of it.
Q. In its way, did that help; did that free you up into the third round?
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, for sure.  I could be as aggressive as I wanted and I did.  And I pulled off a lot of shots that I wanted to.  Made some -- couple nice 15-, 20-footers and hit it close a bunch of time, too, coming down the stretch which was nice.  To be 3- or 4-under the last four holes was a bonus.
Q. How were conditions for you out there, because the wind is up a little but nothing like as cold as yesterday?
THOMAS PIETERS: No, it's not as cold.  It's going to affect us like a one-club wind but it's not as cold as yesterday where you really have to think your way through your shot and hit two or three more club.
Played easier than yesterday but still not an easy course.
Q. I presume you now revise your expectations or aims into the final day?
THOMAS PIETERS: On Thursday, you try to win, and after two rounds of 71, you kind of think it's not going to happen.  But definitely have a chance, so going to shoot for that first place tomorrow.
