Q. You're the Made in Denmark champion, three birdies in a row and you did it in style?
THOMAS PIETERS: I really needed a good finish.  I saw I was one back walking to the green on 16, and I hit a great shot there but I knew I needed to make at least one more, and to finish with two more birdies was pretty cool.
Q. It's been neck-and-neck all afternoon, a fantastic battle with those at the top of the leaderboard.  You have to feel with Joakim at the last to lose a ball at that stage of the game.
THOMAS PIETERS: That's golf.  He'll learn from it and he'll do better next time.
Q. Have to mention The Ryder Cup again.  You've done all you can this week and hopefully caught Darren's eye?
THOMAS PIETERS: Just like you said, I've done all I can.  Now just wait and see.
Q. Great form at the moment, looking now to carry that forward?
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, of course.  It's all about winning tournaments, isn't it.  I'm really happy with this one.  That was one of my goals, to just have one every year, just so you know you're improving and you can win.  That's very important.  Very, very happy.
