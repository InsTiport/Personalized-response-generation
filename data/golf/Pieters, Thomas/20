THOMAS PIETERS: I didn't play that bad.  I just didn't make anything on the greens.  But seeing all my friends out there made it fun and enjoyable.   
 Q.  Just wondering, you've got the two nines, the yellow and the red.  Which is the tougher?  What do you find?  
THOMAS PIETERS: I think the first nine is a bit tougher, just because fairways are a bit more fiddly and narrow, and on the back nine, the greens were a bit bumpy.  But you're always going to get that; 144 players are going to walk on them before you but you know, like I say, if I make a couple putts in the morning, I'll be fine.   
 Q.  Is it always this windy here?  
THOMAS PIETERS: No.  It's kind of like Augusta here today.  It swirls all the time and I got it wrong 100 per cent of the time I think.   
 Q.  It's tough out there.  What do you envision for tomorrow?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, if I just go out there and make a few putts.   Don't need to make a bunch of them, just a decent score and should be fine for the weekend.   
 Q.  Pressure-wise, being a host, how difficult is it, or is it easy?  
THOMAS PIETERS: It's not easy, but I think I didn't do too bad today.  I was a bit nervous on the first tee just because all my friends have never watched me golf.  It's been good fun.   
 Q.  I saw you chuckling on 17 over your third shot.  What was that all about?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Your cameraman, just over your right shoulder, he fell in the ditch and got some muddy shoes.
