 Q.  A lot of support for you out there today?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, more than I expected.  More than last week.   
 Q.  2-under par, it's a difficult course.  How did it feel out there?  Good to be back in the U.K.?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yes, great to be back.  Everybody is on my side here.  It's nice.  I had an interesting start.  I'm still very tired mentally.  Started off with a drive, I shanked my 4-iron on the 10th here can got up-and-down from a hundred yards.  It was a weird way to open the championship.   
But from then on, pretty solid.  Made a couple of good par saves.  Some good wedges.  I feel fine.   
 Q.  Did you say anything to yourself to get back into that mental frame, or did you just go through the motions and focus on each one?  
THOMAS PIETERS: I just tried to hit some good shots.  I know it's a tough course, and quite happy with 2-under.  8-under, it's unbelievable.  Being this tired, I feel very happy actually with the score.   
 Q.  And tomorrow, Kingsbarns, St. Andrews for the next few days, what are you hoping to improve on going forward?  
THOMAS PIETERS: My score.  Yeah, the next two days are going to be a little easier I think.  You can get away with some shots on the next two courses and yeah, you have to go lower on these next two otherwise you're not going to make the cut I think.   
 Q.  Was it more relaxing playing with amateurs after the last few weeks where it's been high-pressure stakes?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, it's been nothing but fun today and laughing and jokes.  It's been good.
