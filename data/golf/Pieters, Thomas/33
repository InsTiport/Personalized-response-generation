 Q. How would you assess your week?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I'm happy the way I fought back after yesterday, a poor round and a lot of bad swings and today I put a lot of good swings on my ball and still a bit disappointed with the way I finished.   
I had a good chance on 18, at 17, at 16 to make par, but just missed out. But I made plenty of birdies today and gave myself a lot of chances.   
   
 Q. How can a week like this kind of catapult your season? You're season's already going pretty well. But how can that give you even more confidence heading into the rest of the year?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Well, it's just nice that I'm playing well. Obviously, I have a lot of time off now, as I'm only playing two or three in the next two or three months, so next one will be the Zurich and it will be fun playing with Daniel there.   
   
 Q. This is your first Masters and your finish was really great. What's your goal going forward to this?  
THOMAS PIETERS: To finish better. Maybe two, three, better than this would be nice.  
   
 Q. So next year you would like to get a Green Jacket?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Who wouldn't?
