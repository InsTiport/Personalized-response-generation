Q. As a rookie, did you feel any trepidation?  You played so well this week.
THOMAS PIETERS: I didn't feel like a rookie, so I think that's good.  Especially playing with Rory, it was smooth sailing for us.  Gave me all the confidence going into today.
Q. You lived here for three years, it was a pretty charged atmosphere out there.  The fact that you were a resident for three years of America, did that give you a different perspective and motivation on what happened this week?
THOMAS PIETERS: I didn't have any issues with the crowd.  They were fantastic.  I definitely got a lot of Illinois support, which was pretty nice, so thank you to them.
