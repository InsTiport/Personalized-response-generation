Q. How was it for you?
THOMAS PIETERS: It's been a struggle on the greens this week.  I've hit it well this week and I've hit some really nice shots but just could not buy a putt this week.  I've holed out twice today and that's the way to do it today.
Q. Are you going to work on the putting ahead of Final Four?
THOMAS PIETERS: I think the greens will be a bit better next week and that will play a part in it.
Q. Positives to take out of this week?
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, for sure.  My ball-striking was good.  I hit 17 greens yesterday and a lot today, as well.  A lot of positives.
Q. How was it playing with Andy and Alex the first couple of days?
THOMAS PIETERS: Great.  Andy and I have become really friendly.  He's a very, very funny guy as we know, and Alex, I've known him for awhile, as well.  It was a pleasure playing with them.
