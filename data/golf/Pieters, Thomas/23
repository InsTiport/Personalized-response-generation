 Q.  How tough was it out there today in the conditions compared to the first three days?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Compared to the first three days, it was really difficult but it was still scorable.  The flags were not too tucked away.  But yeah, Tommy showed 7-under is out there.   
 Q.  How many positives can you take away from this week?  I know you're going to be disappointed today but looking forward, you must take a lot of positives away?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, lots.  Without the wind, I played good and in the wind, I didn't play that good.  So got to work on the swing a little bit, but other than that, a lot of positives, yeah.
