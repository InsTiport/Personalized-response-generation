  THOMAS PIETERS:   I hate to lose, but I gave myself a lot of chances today.   Just didn't quite hole the putts today.

Q.   Presumably as it went on, further and further, there was opportunity?
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, I gave myself a chance on the back nine.   That's all I wanted to do.   Yeah, maybe next week. 

Q.   Presumably, you'll know Qatar and you'll know that your game is in good shape and it's a good course for you?
THOMAS PIETERS:   Never played it but heard good things about it.   I think these three weeks are kind of the same courses, so should be a good week next week, yeah.

Q.   I know we've touched on this already, but nice way to get 2015 with points and money. 
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, get two Topâ€‘10s right away, so happy with how I came out in 2015 and just keep patient and hopefully one day get the win.
