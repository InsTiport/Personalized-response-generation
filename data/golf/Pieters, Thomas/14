 Q.  Back nine was great, four birdies.  Put yourself in contention in this competition.  How do you feel?  
THOMAS PIETERS: I feel good.  I've been driving it very well.  I stayed patient on the greens.  Hit nine greens in regulation on the first nine holes and didn't make anything, so it was very frustrating.  But, yeah, I made some really good putts.  It's good.   
 Q.  There's been a lot of talk with the weather that the greens have gotten a little bit dodgy.  Do you find they're rolling pretty well?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, but they can be bumpy in some parts.   
 Q.  Going into the weekend, we don't know what's going to happen this afternoon, but right now you're just three off the lead.  Your thoughts about your position going into the weekend?  
THOMAS PIETERS: None.  If I just keep playing the way I am, we'll see what happens on Sunday, but if I keep driving it like this, I'll give myself a good chance, I think.   
 Q.  What do you think of this course?  Jordan was saying he's a bit disappointed because it's so soft that it doesn't reward accuracy as much as it would if you played the way it's expected to play.  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, just maybe not -- you can't control the weather.  It is soft, but they've had some rain maybe the last couple weeks or months.  I'm sure it will dry out a little bit.  You can see already the balls are releasing on the fairways whereas on Tuesday it was just pitching.  It plays a bit different in summer, I think.
