 Q.  2-under through two rounds but 64 in round three, what was the difference there?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Definitely my driving.  I struggled off the tee my first round, didn't hit many fairways.  Pete and I worked on the range on Friday night and I solved it a little bit.   
 Q.  I think 22 putts today.  That's got to help the scoring, doesn't it?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, chipped in once and could have been twice on 17, or on 8.  But yeah, rolling it well, so just excited for this afternoon.   
 Q.  You're going to have a little bit of a wait now, aren't you, because finishing where you are with the re-draw and what-have-you, a bit of time; what are you going to do with that time?  
THOMAS PIETERS: It means I get to work on the range.   It's only going to make me better.   
 Q.  Four 2s in your round today; can you remember that happening before on Tour?  
THOMAS PIETERS: No, I don't think so.   
 Q.  After the restart, pretty close one straightaway?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, it went like an inch or something.  Not a bad way to start.   
 Q.  Excited about the position you're in, as well?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I gave myself a /KHAPBLGS.  I didn't think I really had much of a chance, 2-under.  But 8-under always helps.  Just excited about this afternoon.   
 Q.  And those victories last year, do you feel more comfortable being in this position and challenging at the top?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I mean, I expect to be somewhat close to the lead on a Sunday almost every time I play.  I feel like I'm good enough.  Just got to prove it now.
