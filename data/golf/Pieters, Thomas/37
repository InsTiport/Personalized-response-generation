Q. Tell us about your play today.
THOMAS PIETERS: I started off pretty well.  I birdied three or four on the front nine and then got weak on the back nine.  Scott gave me a couple of holes, I gave him a couple of holes.  The back nine was not so good, but the front nine I played really well.  Just got to keep the focus up tomorrow.
Q. It's time to start the journey as well.  You got the one, but you've got two more to go.
THOMAS PIETERS: Exactly.  I don't know what to say to that.
Q. People to used to go home, but you have still got to be focused about playing tomorrow against two more very good players?
THOMAS PIETERS: Of course.  You have to win all of them.  You don't want to be in that position where you want the other one to tie or loss.  You've got to go out and try to win the three matches.
Q. You got off to such a good start.  Birdies on 6, 7 and 8.  You controlled the match from that juncture.
THOMAS PIETERS: My front nine was really good, then back nine I struggled.  We both gave each other some homes.  He gave me a couple more than I gave him.
Q. What was this tournament like for you?  How was the preparation?  Do you look forward to it?
THOMAS PIETERS: I love match play, as you guys know.  I like the one on one.  You have to beat one guy and move on to the next one.  Just looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. Do you look back on your Ryder Cup experience and apply that?
THOMAS PIETERS: I know I'm pretty good at match play.  I like the one on one.
Q. Jhonattan Vegas tomorrow?
THOMAS PIETERS: Yes.
Q. Any thoughts?
THOMAS PIETERS: I played him at the World Cup.  He's a really, really nice guy.  I played with him and his brother.  He's a great player.  Looking forward.
