Q.   What's the verdict, please, Thomas, on your third round performance. 
THOMAS PIETERS:   Not much happened.   Kind of give credit to Martin.   He played a really, really good round of golf.   He didn't really make any mistakes.   Credit to him. 
I've just got to do the same thing tomorrow and hopefully the putts drop. 

Q.   Does it make it difficult for you when you see that from the front row seat and you have to concentrate still on your own game? 
THOMAS PIETERS:   He played great.   I thought I drove it well today, too.   But just didn't really take advantage of my chances and I didn't really hit it close enough to the hole. 

Q.   There was certainly a time there that you were playing terrific golf and we thought it might close the gap for a moment.
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, on the front nine I was playing really good.   Gave myself a bunch of chances and on the back nine, struggled a little bit.   If you hit it offâ€‘line just a couple times and hit it in the thick rough, you're not going to have a chance to go at the flag.

Q.   I take it things worked on the range last night; you were annoyed with the way you finished the second round and had to regroup?
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, just hit some balls, get it out of your system.   I hit it good today, so just going to the range and sort some things out. 

Q.   What are your thoughts into Sunday?
THOMAS PIETERS:   Just go as low as I can.
