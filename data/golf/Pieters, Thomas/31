Q. 7-under through two rounds.  Give us your assessment of today's second round?
THOMAS PIETERS: Much less stressful than yesterday.  I hit a lot more greens today.  Didn't make as many putts as yesterday but that's always going to happen.  So I'm quite happy about today.
Q. Having seen the course yesterday and the way these greens have played, is there any change of strategy for today?
THOMAS PIETERS: You do need to think about kind of not linksy but you need to hit it in front of the flags sometimes and let it release and even with a wedge you have to play it for a couple bounces and then check.  I love this type of golf where you have to think a lot more, other than just start throwing darts at the flag.
Q. What's been the most pleasing aspect over the first two days for you?
THOMAS PIETERS: Finding fairways.  I've been struggling a bit with that.  Only hitting 50 per cent of the fairways and I think I've done really well these last two days.
Q. The breeze can change quite dramatically if it picks up this afternoon and tomorrow.
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, it's a bit gusty at times, like Augusta, make I like it, that's why.  On 10, for example, it's hard to pull a club because you're in the corner and you know the wind such there and you don't feel it.  It gets quite tricky.
