Q. The matches are now tied.  A lot of people out there, a lot of noise, energy.  How would you describe the crowd?  Spirited?  Tough?  Over the line?  Ugly?
RORY McILROY: Probably a combination of all of those.  I'd say most of all tough.  It's a tough environment for us to come and play in.  We expect that.  It's same for the U.S. guys when they come to play in Europe.  You have to keep your concentration out there.  It's been a long day and sometimes emotions run high.
Again, we're just glad to get it done and move on, help Europe get another point on the board.
Q. You're being diplomatic.  How much did it fuel you?
RORY McILROY: It fueled me a lot.  The more they shouted, the better we played.  I hope they shout at us all day tomorrow.
Q. Thomas, you are the only rookie from either side who's played in every single match.  Is this what you expected?
THOMAS PIETERS: I didn't know what to expect, but it's going pretty good so far.
Q. I think that's an understatement.  Three points for you.  You know the American crowds.  You lived here, went to Illinois.  What do you make of the atmosphere?
THOMAS PIETERS: Well, it's not three points for me, three points for us.  I do get some support from your crowd.  The heckling, it just pumps us up.  So hopefully the same for tomorrow.
