 Q.  Great round yesterday and today set up by some fantastic approach play?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, again, off the tee I was good which allows me to be aggressive with my approaches and just a couple putts that didn't drop today that dropped yesterday, but overall very happy.   
 Q.  How were the difference in conditions today, still a little softer, more breeze early on?  
THOMAS PIETERS: I thought it was fun when it played, with the wind it was tricky and we had to think.  Obviously the greens weren't as pure as yesterday morning but same for everybody.   
 Q.  Very congested at the top of the leaderboard and promises to be a fascinating weekend.  How nice to be challenging in a Rolex Series Event?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I haven't been here in a while to be honest but I feel fine.  I feel relaxed.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  Good crowds here, as well.  What's the atmosphere been like?  Have you been able to enjoy the two rounds so far?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I love playing with Francesco, home favourite, and he won last week.  Massive support for him.  Hope I play with him tomorrow.
