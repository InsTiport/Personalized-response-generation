  THOMAS PIETERS:   It was nice to start out the season with a 7‑under, so, I'm happy.

Q.   Talk me through it just a little bit.   You seemed to really get off the blocks pretty quick. 
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, I've been driving it a lot better.   I think that's the key out here.   You have to drive it around the fairway and I drove it long today, so gave myself a lot of wedges in and converted some putts.   It was nice.

Q.   Did you get that sense that it was going to be one of those really good days?
THOMAS PIETERS:   No, I was going along quietly, just making a couple birdies around the turn, I made four in a row and that was nice.   Then to make birdie on 18 was good, too. 

Q.   Does this course suit you? 
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yes. 

Q.   Tell me why?   Elaborate. 
THOMAS PIETERS:   If you drive it well and drive it long; guys are going to hit 5‑irons, and I'm hitting 9‑iron or wedge in.   That's a big difference. 

Q.   Meant to be tough and been toughened up, as well. 
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, we played on Monday it was really tough, really windy, so kind of scared me how tough it played and then this morning was perfect, no wind, perfect conditions.   Good to take advantage of that.

Q.   You come out with a nice bit of experience under the belt.   So there are new aims, resolutions, new targets?
THOMAS PIETERS:   Definitely, new goals and a new year, so excited to go.

Q.   Anything you can share? 
THOMAS PIETERS:   No, I'll keep them for myself.   You'll see.

Q.   But I'm sure you'd like to step up on what was a promising start last year. 
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, I was happy with some parts.   Pretty disappointed with how many cuts I missed last year so trying to be a little more consistent and keep it going.   It's a good start. 

Q.   You had an invite here last year courtesy of the tourism board; how much did that help you for your round today? 
THOMAS PIETERS:   It was nice to have seen the course before.   I didn't play very well last year because I just came straight from a skiing holiday, so I wasn't prepared.   But I was very happy to get the invite.   Got some rounds under my belt from last year.

Q.   And how did you find the course changes? 
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, I like the greens here.   They changed a couple of the greens around, like 4, it's going to be a really good pin and they put it front right, and I think 2 is really good, too. 

Q.   And is it in excellent condition?
THOMAS PIETERS:   Yes, it is very good.
