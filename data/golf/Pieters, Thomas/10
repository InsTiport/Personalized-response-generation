 Q.  Birdies on two of the three opening holes today and that really helped set the tone for what was a great opening found roar you?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I struck the ball really well today off the tee.  I've struggled in years past because I really like the course but off the tee I've just not put myself in good positions.  I hit a lot of greens.  I didn't putt very good today.  I had three 3-putts I think, so that kind of killed my momentum today.   
But very happy, yeah.   
 Q.  68 is your lowest on this golf course.  I think back in 2015 you opened up with two 69s and that's only the third time you've broken 70 on this golf course.  
THOMAS PIETERS: That's poor stats.  Thanks for that.  I guess I'm going to try and break 70 every day now.   
 Q.  Might be the lucky omen.  You dropped a shot on 17 but nice to bounce back with a birdie to finish on the closing hole there?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, three bogeys today and I bounced back straightaway, so that was quite nice.  You know, trying to just manage my emotions a bit better.  Just got to learn every year, and it's not been the best year but definitely learning something this year, so that's good.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy playing this golf course?  
THOMAS PIETERS: I do.  I just haven't had good results.  It doesn't have the positive vibes that you want, and hopefully I can change it this week.
