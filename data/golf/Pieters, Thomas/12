 Q.  A great round of 64 today.  How was that for you?  
THOMAS PIETERS: It was great.  Any time you have I think 19 putts, I think my putting coach is higher, so I'll give him a little credit.  It was good today, really good.   
 Q.  What was the difference between today and yesterday?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Obviously my putting.  I had may 30 putts yesterday and 19 today.  That's an 11-shot difference.  My focus is a lot better, and plus I had plenty more chances today.  I played the par 5s well.   
 Q.  How much confidence does this give you going into the weekend?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Well, I mean, yesterday, I actually didn't play bad and still shot 3-over but kind of stayed patient and I stayed calm, which I don't normally do very often.  So I've been trying to work on that a lot.  Yeah, today, it just came together and rolled in a lot of putts.
