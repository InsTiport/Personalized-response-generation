 Q.  You were able to come back and get a half.  Adam made a mistake on 16.  You made a nice putt on 17.  And obviously not a win, but nice to get a half, for sure?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Oh, yeah.  2-down with 3 to go, you're thinking half or a win would be a very nice finish.  But we both played some good golf.  I think a half is good for today.   
 Q.  Obviously a lot going on with your home country and things like that.  You were able to put that out of your mind?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Not really.  It's nice that people are shouting stuff like they're thinking of us and gives me goosebumps right now.  But I definitely am thinking about it on the course.  You can't put that out of your mind, something like that.  It does affect you for life, I think.   
 Q.  Do you know who you play tomorrow, is it Bill?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, I think so.   
 Q.  What do you know about his game?  
THOMAS PIETERS: I've never met Bill.  I've heard he's a super nice guy.  Adam was really nice to meet today.
