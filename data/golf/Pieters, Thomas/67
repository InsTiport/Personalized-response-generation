 Q.  What is your verdict on the week?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Obviously disappointed over the weekend.  I just could not make many putts.  I thought yesterday, I didn't play great, but today, I hit a lot of fairways and gave myself a lot of opportunities and just couldn't make them.   
So you know, it was just got to stay patient and kind of lost my patience a little bit out there today maybe.  But making double on 11 definitely hurt me.  But still happy the way I finished.   
 Q.  When you started, were you actually thinking of second position or just do the best you can, or was there any chance of upsetting Andy Sullivan?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Of course, you never know.  If I go out and shoot 62; it's golf, you never know what happens.  I definitely had a low number in mind, and 69 wasn't the number I was looking for.  But that's how it is.   
 Q.  Do you have an appreciation of just how well he's played across the course of this week?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, to make that many putts as he did yesterday, too, is pretty impressive, and he didn't miss a shot yesterday.  To shoot 5-under yesterday in that wind was very impressive, and I don't know, he's 2-under today.  That's good playing.
