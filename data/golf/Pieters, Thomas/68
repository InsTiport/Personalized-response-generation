 Q.  Well played this afternoon, always nice to back up a good round from yesterday with a good one today.  How did it feel out there?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, for sure.  I thought I played better yesterday, but hit it close a couple of times.  Took advantage of the par-5s.  Pretty disappointed with the finish, missing two short ones.  Gave myself a chance going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  Was there a big difference with the greens this afternoon compared to yesterday morning?  
THOMAS PIETERS: They were a little bumpy near the end.  It's the same for everybody, so going to hit some good putts that don't go in and some bad putts that might jump in.  You have got to take it how it is.   
 Q.  You are only three behind for tomorrow.  A lot of bad weather coming in.  What is the strategy with a lot of breeze and a lot of bad wind?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Still got to make birdies.  I don't know how bad it's going to be, but I hope to get three rounds in for sure.   
 Q.  You've obviously had two fantastic wins this season.  How much confidence does that give you heading into the weekend?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Well, I know I can do it.  I know the course suits me, so why can't I do it?  It's quite easy:  You just have to play well and see what happens.
