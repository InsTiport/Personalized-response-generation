  Q. 66-74 for a two-day total of even par.  Talk about the different conditions out there today.
 THOMAS PIETERS:   Yeah, this morning was actually okay.  It wasn't that windy.  Drove it well, so I gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Yeah, back nine the wind got up, and yeah, I don't know, my scorecard says it all.  I missed a few really short putts, which still hurts, but in the end, not unhappy where I'm at.
 I think I won't be too far away.
 Q. What do you think it's going to be like for the guys playing this afternoon?
 THOMAS PIETERS:   Really tough.  I mean, I'm going to enjoy watching the golf this afternoon from my sofa.
 Q. What's the game plan for tomorrow?
 THOMAS PIETERS:   Just hitting fairways.  I didn't hit many fairways today, so I'm going to work on some things and then hopefully have a better focus tomorrow and find those fairways.
 Q. What have you learned about the course now so far this week?
 THOMAS PIETERS:   Other than that it's really tough?  Nothing special.  It's just a golf course.  But the conditions just make it really tough.
