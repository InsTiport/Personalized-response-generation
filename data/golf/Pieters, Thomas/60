 Q.  What are your thoughts on shooting 67 to start?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Quite happy after spending all the time at home, three months or so.  It's nice to come out and shoot a low round and get yourself right up there.   
 Q.  You'd better tell us what has happened, why you've spent so much time at home?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, because of a left thumb injury, just stayed at home to get that healthy, and I was going to play last week but pulled out.  Just get some more rest to make sure I'm ready for this busy summer stretch.   
 Q.  How did you do it?  Is it entirely healed as this score suggests?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, it's apparently healed.  I can't practice too much.  I tend to hit a lot of balls so I have to back off a little bit and restrict my practice a little bit more.   
It's a big week.  It's one of the better fields we have all year on a great course, great event.  Really happy with the opening round.   
 Q.  Your round itself, as well, we usually expect you to do something at the par 5s; the par 3s were very kind this time?  
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, because my ball-striking is good.  The par 5s, not so good today.  Missed a short one for birdie and made birdie on the 15th or 14th.  But 9, played it terrible, made five.  But I'll try to do better on the par 5s tomorrow.
