Q. Great finish, a 65.  You must be very pleased with that?
THOMAS PIETERS: I am, I kept the ball in play, unlike last week when I was struggling off the tee.  Putter was going well, and like I said, a lot of chances for birdies.  Just missed a couple.
Q. Very soft conditions here.  How nice is it that you can be aggressive into the greens and know that the ball is going to respond?
THOMAS PIETERS: It is nice but then again, it's so soft that you need to fly it at the pin and stop it, so sometimes it's a bit scary with a back flag, so you really need to trust your number.  I think all three of us in the group did a pretty good job.
Q. Ross made a solid finish, as well and Francesco winning last week.  Did you have fun out there?
THOMAS PIETERS: It's nice when all three of us play well and cheer each other on with positive play and a lot of birdies.
Q. Second Rolex Series Event of the year, what would it mean for you to have a good, solid performance this week?
THOMAS PIETERS: A lot, of course.  It's not been a great season yet, but there's big ones coming up now, and we'll see.
