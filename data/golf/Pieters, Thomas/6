Q. A 68, round three. How was that for you?
THOMAS PIETERS: I played unbelievable. I didn't really make a lot of putts out there, which is kind of frustrating coming off the course, but still my game, I think in the last two weeks has come a long way, to be able to control my ball the way I did today was pretty pleasing.
Q. You said you're going to go work on putting after this?
THOMAS PIETERS: Yeah, definitely, I'm going to work on the 10-footers and hopefully we can make some tomorrow.
Q. Currently six shots back. Is that too far back or are you still in this?
THOMAS PIETERS: It's a long way back, but I feel like anything, if there's a bit of wind, any score is possible. Rory shot 7-under. You know, you can go sideways pretty quick here, as well. The greens are pretty slick, so I think if you do make a lot of putts tomorrow, then you'll be fine.
