  Q. You find out late that you would be in the tournament. How are you settling in and everything so far?  
 STEVE WAUGH: Yeah, found out real late. I knew for sure I was in Sunday. And so I guess I didn't have as much time to get all excited and nervous but by the time I got to the first tee I was pretty nervous. But it was a lot of fun. We had a great time. I had a real good group to play with and we had a great time.  
  
  Q. How is the course? Any challenges for you?  
 STEVE WAUGH: Every hole. It's a great golf course. With the wind the way it's blowing, and the greens as fast as they are, it's a challenge, every hole. But keep your ball in the fairway and knock it on the green it's a great course.   
  
  Q. Are you having fun?  
 STEVE WAUGH: Having a great time.
