 Q. You shot 75 today. Just kind of go over your round. Just give us a quick overview. 
 BRIAN KELLY: Front nine was awful. I was a little nervous starting out and it was raining. Didn't hit a whole lot of good shots. I think I only hit one green in regulation on the front. 
 I made the turn and started off good, birdied 2 and then the rains came. Which actually didn't bother me because I got to hit some more balls which I probably needed more than anything. 
 I went back out, bogeyed 5 and then made a really good par on 6. 
 Birdied 7 and 8 and feel like it's not a total loss. 

 Q. That's a pretty good round. Now you played the back nine first. Do you think that is more difficult of the nines?
 BRIAN KELLY: I'm going to say yes. 

 Q. It's playing that way?
 BRIAN KELLY: Yeah, I think it is. I just, I don't know, I don't hit it very far and there's a lot of hybrids and fairway woods that I have to hit out there. I really happy they moved a bunch of the tees up because otherwise I would be laying up. But it was, yeah, the back nine is tough. 
 The way the conditions are, it's a real shame that the course couldn't be playing hard and fast like I think everybody would like. 

 Q. How wet was it out there? Have you seen any wetter conditions?
 BRIAN KELLY: When we close the course. We would close the course if it was like this. The greens are amazing. They're so dry and a little firm, but what have they had, two feet of rain here in the last two days?
