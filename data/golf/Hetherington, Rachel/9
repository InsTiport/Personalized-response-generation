RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  Bogeyed one.  Hit bad second shot left of the green, just made bogey.  3rd hole was par 3.  I hit a 7-iron I guess to about ten feet and made the putt for birdie.  The 2nd hole, I hit pitching wedge to about three feet and made the birdie.  No.  8, I hit a bad drive right and chipped out, made a bogey.  Then 11 - I have to remember 11 - I hit a 5-iron to about maybe 20, 25 feet left of the pin, made the putt.  On 12, I hit a 4-iron to about 20 feet and made the putt.  13, I hit a 7-iron to about four feet and made the putt.  16, I hit the green and 3-putted for bogey. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  I hit like the front edge.  It was quite a ways.  Probably at least 30 feet or so.  I'm not sure. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  The second putt was a good ten feet.  Got closer, short (laughter). 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  Yeah, No.  8, I hit a drive right into the scrub and chipped out, made bogey there. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  I actually didn't see a board until 14, so I think I was one over on the front, so I was 4-under.  Actually, I saw the board on 9.  They were both at 9 then.  You know, I thought I still had a chance then, I felt, if I could get it together.  I didn't hit the ball very well all day, so it was a bit of a battle.  But once I made the three birdies in a row, you know, I thought I was getting closer.  Then when I looked at the board on 14, I think was Dottie at 7? 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  8, okay, that's right.  So then, you know, I thought if I could birdie in or still make a few birdies on the last three or four holes, I'd still have a chance.  I wasn't playing that well, so I just tried to hang in there, you know, hit the fairways and greens coming in. 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  Yeah, I really just made some good putts.  I didn't hit a good shot on 11.  I hit a good shot on 12 and 13, though.  I kind of have been battling all week with my ball striking.  I haven't been hitting it as well as I wanted to.  Every day I've just been trying to work on it and get a little bit better.  You know, I think every day I've made a few birdies in a row or two birdies in a row.  I hit good for a couple of holes, then it goes, then it comes back.  Today it was away for most of the day (laughter).  Any more questions?  I answered everything (laughter)? 

Q.  (Inaudible)? 

RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  Yeah, I felt like it was pretty tough.  I think on Friday it was similar conditions.  I think I shot 1-under on Friday and I moved up the board.  You know, I knew if I could keep it under par on the Back  9, you know, I'd get close to the top few for sure.  But obviously the way Dottie is playing, I really had to hit some good shots coming in and make birdies.  She played better than me, so . . .  She's played well all week.  9-under is a good score around here.
