 Q.  Talk about your match, coming down to the 18th hole. 
 RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  I guess we both played okay but we both missed our chances, too.  It was nice to birdie one on 18, my first birdie of the day. 

 Q.  So how is the tournament going, and looking forward to tomorrow, you're now in the third round. 
 RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  I am.  I'm looking forward to it, yeah.  This might be the furthest I've gone, so excited to make Saturday at last.  I'm playing pretty solid.  So I have to make a few more putts.  We'll see how it goes. 

 Q.  What's going well for you?  Is an advantage playing this course before even though it was a different tournament, or with the renovations, is it really different? 
 RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  I'm playing solid and getting my confidence back.  The greens are kind of new for all of us, so you have to take a little bit more time getting to know the greens.  They are pretty fast and slopey. 
 So there's really not too much of an advantage other than that, just trying to play my game and keep my confidence up. 

 Q.  Did the wind play a factor at all? 
 RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  Today was pretty tough with the wind, it was.  Hopefully it will die down over the weekend.
