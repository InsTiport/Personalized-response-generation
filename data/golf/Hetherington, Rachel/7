Q.  Tell us a little bit about your match.
RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  Yeah, I played great golf today.  I had nine birdies myself.  And Kimmie gave me the 14th for birdie.  I played extremely well today, probably the best I ever played.   I had nine birdies in 13 holes.

And Kimmie played great, too.  I think she must have shot 4  or 5 under herself.  A couple of holes we halved in birdies.   I think on No. 8, she was really close, and I was about ten feet and I was able to make the birdie to halve her there.

On 9, we halved in birdies.  And on 12, we halved on birdied.  I just played great all day.  I'm very happy.
Q.  You're seeded 48th, but the way you played today?
RACHEL HETHERINGTON:  Yeah, I feel like the last couple of weeks, it's kind of been coming together.  And I've been turning some good rounds in, along with some bad rounds, but the last few weeks, it started to turn around.  I started hitting more fairways.  I changed drivers.  I've just got a little bit more confident in my game from hitting more fairways and I think today I had a good rhythm and a good feel for my driver, and that went through the rest of my game into my irons.
