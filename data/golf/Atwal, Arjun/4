Q.   Arjun, the adrenaline must be flowing now?
    ARJUN ATWAL:   I'm actually tired.   I don't know what was flowing.   I got a little tired towards the end of the rounds but it was a good day.

Q.   Must be good to be the joint lead going into tomorrow?
    ARJUN ATWAL:   Yeah, it is.   It's been a while.   So, you know, we'll see.   We'll see how it goes.

Q.   What will be the key tomorrow, do you reckon? 
    ARJUN ATWAL:   Just make a lot of putts.   Make a lot of birdies. 

Q.   Have you been doing that this week? 
    ARJUN ATWAL:   Yeah, yeah, started yesterday and was pretty decent today. 

Q.   Confidence going into the final day? 
    ARJUN ATWAL:   I don't know, I'll let you guys know tomorrow.   We'll see.   We'll see.   I'm okay.   50/50.

Q.   What is it about the Indian golfers doing so well?   There's two of you now tied there. 
    ARJUN ATWAL:   Yeah, we're decent golfers I guess, that's why, as we've proven on this tour and other tours.   It's going to be fun tomorrow I think. 

Q.   You won last four years ago; would you be drawing back on those experiences and the experiences of winning so many Asian Tour events tomorrow? 
    ARJUN ATWAL:   No, just going to play.   Those are done, finished.   I'm just going to go out there and just play.   I never do that, anyway.   It's just a new day.
