  Q. In a situation like this, Disney makes you kind of put the pedal down. Do you feel like you had to be aggressive today?  
 ARJUN ATWAL: No, not at all. I just, you know, really didn't expect much from the round today. It's been a mixed bag of everything this year, so when I started to hit it good, then I (indiscernible) putting really well.   
 So today I didn't really have any expectations of trying to hit it, shoot low or whatever. Just whatever it gave me.  
  
  Q. Does that sometimes just free you up?   
 ARJUN ATWAL: I think so. You know, today I didn't think ahead of myself; I didn't think about anything. Just one shot at a time, like they say, but it was actually happening.   
 So it was good.  
  
  Q. Is that something that it's hard to kind of put yourself in this mindset?  
 ARJUN ATWAL: Sometimes it is, yeah. Uh-huh. I mean, when you're over a shot you're thinking about the previous ones and what's ahead of you and all that. And no matter what people say, sometimes it does play on your mind. Today it was kind of easier.   
  
  Q. When was the last time you played here?   
 ARJUN ATWAL: I don't know. Didn't play last year. I hadn't played in -- it's been a while. I don't remember now. (Laughter.) I can't remember.   
 Maybe two years ago, three years ago. I don't know. Something like that.  
  
  Q. I think the course changes were longer ago than that. But you're familiar?  
 ARJUN ATWAL: Oh, yeah, no, I played the back with the longer holes and whatever. No issue with that.   
  
  Q. Okay. All right. Glad you're playing well.   
 ARJUN ATWAL: Thank you.
