Q.  (Inaudible).
ARJUN ATWAL:  I putted great all day.  You know, I was thinking about the line.  I thought it was inside left, but obviously it was a little bit more than that.  It went right anyway.
Q.  I know you wanted to put yourself in position to win.
ARJUN ATWAL:  Well, I'm not right now, but, I mean, it's always a good week when you're in contention.  I'm just a little disappointed right now with the way I ended things.
Q.  At one time I think there was seven, eight guys tied for the lead.
ARJUN ATWAL:  Yeah, last year I lost to Phil and we had a five way playoff.  I think at that time, as well, there were seven or eight guys in contention.  I lost in a playoff there.
Q.  18 here gives people an opportunity essentially, and it makes it a little bit more exciting and it seems like people are going for it.
ARJUN ATWAL:  I think it's much better.
Q.  Brandt Jobe, yourself, Phil Mickelson all in contention, Lucas Glover, one underneath.
ARJUN ATWAL:  Right.  It's just nice seeing guys playing well.
