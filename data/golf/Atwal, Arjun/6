 Q.   Arjun, 1‑under par, 69 playing in the final group.   How did you feel today?  
ARJUN ATWAL:   Well, I was a little tight starting off, you know, because I haven't been in this position in a while.   
Basically I've struggled all year, so I was a little tight, but I'll take it.   It's not too bad.   It's not a bad score.   
   
 Q.   Yeah, I feel like that finish, you made a few late birdies, really helped your cause for tomorrow.   
ARJUN ATWAL:   Yeah.   I told my caddie after I three‑putted that ‑‑ I think it was 14, you know, get it anywhere under par today I think we still got a shot for tomorrow.   And I think two back is not too far back, so it'll be fun tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Definitely anything you feel like you gotta clean up a little bit before tomorrow's final round?  
ARJUN ATWAL:   Just no 3‑putting.   I've three‑putted two or three times already in the last two or 3days.   Can't do that if you're going to try to win tournaments.   
   
 Q.   We'll be pulling for you.   Good luck tomorrow.
