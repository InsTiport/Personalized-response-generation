Q. First of all, just tell me about your match.ALICE JO: Yeah, today at the beginning, my ball was like pretty consistent, but yeah, after -- in the back nine, my ball started going like left and right, and it was like pretty rough.  But yeah, so I was pretty lucky to win today.  I couldn't make any putts, so I hope it's like better tomorrow, but yeah, keep working on it.Q. Going both ways, why was that the case?ALICE JO: I'm not sure.  I think I was a little nervous.Q. Do you prefer match play or stroke play?ALICE JO: I'm okay with both, actually, yeah, because last year after the Pub Links I know how to play match play now, so it's okay both ways.Q. Do you feel like this course suits your game moving forward?ALICE JO: Yeah, I like the course.  Yeah.
