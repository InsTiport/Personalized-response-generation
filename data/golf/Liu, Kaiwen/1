 Q.  Talk about the round a little bit.  
KAIWEN LIU: Yeah, well, I feel like I didn't start the round great, even though I was 1-up after one.  Cole bogeyed the 1st hole, so it's not like...   
I feel like I didn't start the round great.  I was able to play a good back nine, but Cole just made a lot of putts.  He played really good on the back nine.  I'm really happy for him.   
 Q.  What are you going to take from this experience?  
KAIWEN LIU: I think I just learned a lot about my game and what I do like under pressure and how to do better next time.   
Every tournament I try to learn something, so I think I learned that from today, what I want to work on in the future to improve.   
 Q.  You qualify for the U.S. Am in a few weeks.  
KAIWEN LIU: Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you think this experience will help you?  
KAIWEN LIU: For sure.  It will be challenging, but now I knew what I need to work on and I feel better prepared for it.
