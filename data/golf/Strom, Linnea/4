Q. Take us through the ace on No. 8?
LINNEA STROM:   Well, I think I had 146 meters to the flag, so it was kind of perfect for an 8-iron, and I had just had can you believe and a bogey and my caddie just told me, okay, let's restart and start over.  And I was just trying to hit a good shot and it was actually a perfect shot.  Hit it right at the pin and just landed a little short of it and rolled in.  I couldn't see it.  But Cristie saw it, she said it went in, so that was nice.
Q. Were you trying to go pin-high on that hole?
LINNEA STROM:   Yeah, I actually was.  From the tee I felt like I had a good angle at it, so I was kind of just hitting good 8-iron just right at the pin and yeah.
Q. Did you feel it gave you momentum for the rest of the day?
LINNEA STROM:   It can a little bit because I started off pretty good with three birdies but then I had two bad holes and then yeah, well, I was a little bit off all day pretty much, but it gave me some energy after that hole-in-one a little bit.
Q. And every hole-in-one this year, obviously money gets raised, $20,000 to St. Jude.  What does it mean to you to know that a hole-in-one on Tour here can go towards something like that?
LINNEA STROM:   Yeah, that's very nice, and that was actually the first thing I thought of when I made a hole-in-one.  I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to raise some money.  So that's very nice, and obviously feels very good to do something good for them.
