An Interview With:   
MARK HUBBARD   
 Q.  Mark, great round of golf for you and making that turn had to be great to see that ball drop in for a deuce.  
MARK HUBBARD: Yeah.  That definitely keeps the momentum going.  I've been grinding with a couple of par saves, so it was nice to not have to putt for a change.   
 Q.  You used the word grinding.  Did it feel like a grind out there today?  You have a clean card, but I know all those pars weren't easy.  
MARK HUBBARD: Yeah.  I made a ton of like 5-, 6-footers for par.  So especially coming down the stretch, so for a bogey-free round it was definitely a little stressful coming in.  I was just trying to get into the house.   
 Q.  I was surprised probably as much as you were the putt didn't get to the hole on 17 down that slope there.  You looked a little befuddled there.  
MARK HUBBARD: Yeah.  I thought it was going to be really fast.  I think I was going so much into that side slope that it actually slowed it down and made a right-hand turn, but just happy I made the next one.   
 Q.  Double sixes look pretty good on the score card.  4-under, good luck tomorrow.  
MARK HUBBARD: Thank you.
