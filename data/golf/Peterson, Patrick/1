Q. If you can just talk about the Tournament and kind of what you're looking forward to this weekend. 
PATRICK PETERSON: Being here, being invited to the DRI Golf Tournament was a pleasure. Whenever you have the opportunity to give back and show others that you care about them and playing golf for a great cause, you can't beat it. So I'm happy that I got the invite. 
Wish I was playing this weekend, but it's a great getaway to, I guess, kind of relax and let the football life go for a couple weeks.
