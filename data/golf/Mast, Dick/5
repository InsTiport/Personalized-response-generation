Q.   Here with Dick Mast following the fourth round of the Championship. 
Dick, in talking to a number of players, it seemed like birdies were a little bit harder to come by today.   Was that just the golf course or the final round of the Championship? 
DICK MAST:   The golf course changed totally.   The greens were not receptive.   So you had to be in the fairway, and you get on the wrong side, you couldn't get up and down.   You had to have short game to kind of hold you in there.

Q.   We talked about it before earlier in the week.   Finding the fairway is an adventure here with the tall grass.   It's really a priority still, isn't it? 
DICK MAST:   Even more so today.   The greens were very difficult.   This was more like‑‑ a little more like an Open air.   The greens weren't receiving.

Q.   Four rounds, and you finished under par in a major championship.   Some good memories going home from Indianwood? 
DICK MAST:   I'm playing well.   I need to work on my short game a little bit.   Yeah, yeah, I enjoyed the golf course.   It was challenging.   I'd love to come back sometime.
