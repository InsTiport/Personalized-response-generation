Q.   You made three birdies on the back nine.   What was your approach on those last nine holes?
DICK MAST:   Try to birdie every hole.   No, I let a lot get away on the par‑5s today.   I got home on two of them and made bogeys.   I lost quite a bit on the par‑5s. 
It was a tough day to hit the right club.   The greens firmed up late and I hit quite a few shots through the greens.   It's pretty hard with these pins, you get snookered pretty quick.   So I made a couple putts on the back.

Q.   And then being plus 2 and getting to play in the morning tomorrow, do you feel pretty good about where you are?
DICK MAST:   Well, it could have been worse, yeah.   I felt like I could have been better as well. 

Q.   What would you like to, where can you improve your game tomorrow would you say?
DICK MAST:   Well, I just need to pull the right club and read greens better, get to know the course a little better.   And we had the tough conditions today, the greens dried out and it was windy, and that's the way it is.
