SIMIN FENG: I had not a good start and made a double bogey at the first hole, like the first round. The little sister (Ren Yue) in the same group had the hottest start and made an eagle-birdie start. Our gap became a little big bigger over the two holes. That definitely inspired me to play better. Of course I wanted to regroup after the first hole. It didnât mean that I needed to surpass her or something else. My plan was that I played shot by shot from the very beginning. I made a birdie at the third hole. Since then, I played to my standard.
