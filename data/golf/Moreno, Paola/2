Q.   All right, Paula, 5‑under today on a 12‑hole course.   Just talk about coming into today, what your mindset was like to play a course that wasn't 18 holes long. 
PAOLA MORENO:   Obviously I wanted to play.   We all wanted to play and I got here and there was a delay, so it worked out fine and I warmed up and I played my 12 holes which was great.   I'm not complaining about my tee time or anything.   The course was setup different.   Let's just put it that way.
But I'm excited.   I played really well, putted very, very solid today.

Q.   Did you feel this coming today?   Did you have any good feelings about your game?
PAOLA MORENO:   I just wanted to have fun.   I knew the course was playing extremely different from what I played on Monday, and I just wanted to do the best I could and have a good attitude and enjoy the day.

Q.   Do you think maybe the change in the course helped you kind of not worry too much about the game and just go play?
PAOLA MORENO:   I'm sure ‑‑ I mean I'm sure that's one of the things, and I just decided to do the best I could, just hit my irons, my yardages, and make some putts, and it worked pretty well today.

Q.   For some fans who might not recognize your name, what would you want them to know about you?
PAOLA MORENO:   I'm Colombian.   I'm Teen Herbal Life.   And I went to USC, University of southern California.   I graduated, won a national championship with my team, and I just love to be on the LPGA and having fun. 

Q.   Cool.   Thanks so much.   Great round. 
PAOLA MORENO:   Thank you guys.
