Q.   Talk about how you felt through the first 8 holes. 
BARRY EVANS:   I started out a little shaky, but I was getting up‑and‑down.   I played good today.   I didn't play bad yesterday, it was just brutal, I just made bogeys, just tough in the conditions. 
Today I played good.   I made one, I think it was about 16, I thought I hit a good shot and it came up short in the hazard.   But other than that I played good today.

Q.   Holes 13 through 16 a little up‑and‑down.   What was going on through that stretch?
BARRY EVANS:   I don't know.   I was hitting good shots.   Even with no wind, this is a tough golf course.   You got to get on the right level.   If you short side yourself you're in deep trouble.

Q.   With the wind going in a different direction did it almost play like a completely different course today?
BARRY EVANS:   It played way different, because yesterday it was blowing hard.   But it's still, the wind was enough today where it affected a lot of shots.   But it was not nearly as hard as yesterday.
