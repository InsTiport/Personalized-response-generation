Q. Go ahead and talk to me about your round, talk me through it, what you did well.PETER FOWLER: Well, it wasn't my best round today, but I haven't played too many last groups in the U.S. Open, especially with a hero like Tom Watson.  So I was probably a little bit off -- you know, just a little bit off my game, but I thought I held it in there well today.  Still in a good position for tomorrow.Q. Talk more about that position.  You like where you are with 18 holes left to play in the Championship?PETER FOWLER: Like I said yesterday, I don't think anybody's really going to run away with it.  There's not a lot of birdie holes, gimme birdie holes.  So you've got to get your shots.  If you can make half of those birdies and even a couple of bogeys, you still have a chance. But the weather's good, and the course is playing great.Q. How do you go about a final round like that?  Do you kind of feel out the first nine holes and then go for it on the back nine?  What's your strategy there?PETER FOWLER: I think you've got to be right on the ball.  The first hole is the only real birdie hole on the course.  You've got to be right on the ball and get off to a good start and sort of get off to a good rhythm immediately.  You don't want to wait too many holes or any holes before you get going.
