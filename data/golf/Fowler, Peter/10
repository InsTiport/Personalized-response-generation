  PETER FOWLER:   I'd have taken that any day.   Yeah, drove the ball really good.   I've been playing the front nine under par each day.   I finally got the back nine sorted out.   But I rolled a few good putts and got a couple of up‑and‑downs out of the bunkers, which is not that easy.

Q.   You had an amazing year last year, winning the Order of Merit, 13 top 10s, two wins.   Did that change your perspective of yourself as a player? 
PETER FOWLER:   Yeah, it probably did.   I played well the year before, but I putted terribly.   But last year I really got it together, and I drove the ball well.   That's been one thing lacking in my golf throughout my career.   But last year I finally drove the ball well, and it's a good test of driving out on courses like this.   Yeah, I'm really happy with it.

Q.   You're going to have a chance to win a senior major tomorrow.   How exciting is that prospect?
PETER FOWLER:   Well, I'm excited about it being at Turnberry and playing a really top‑class course.   I've been inspired by playing with the likes of Woosie and John Cook and Peter Senior, the guys that have been beating me pretty easily over the years and watch how they go about it.   And playing a major, it's the only chance we get to really see the full range of players and top‑class players.   They've won many tournaments over the years, so a lot of inspiration from watching them and competing with them.
