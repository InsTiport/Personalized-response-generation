 Q.  So I want to walk through Hole 8 for you, which is widely regarded as probably the toughest hole on the course.  You birdied the hole.  Can you kind of walk me through that, what the process was, how it was playing for you?  
PETER FOWLER: I had a poor hook off the tee in the trees, and hit a 7 wood down there 45 yards short and held the pitch up.   
 Q.  Nice.  Like I said --  
PETER FOWLER: Well, it's a par 5.  Like anything, if you can reach the green, you probably -- it's highly unlikely you can stay on the green.  So it's a difficult hole.   
 Q.  Other than that, how did everything play today?  It was a lot different from the past couple days.  The wind was a lot heavier.  
PETER FOWLER: The ball sort of goes through the wind.  It's not like on the coast.  Because it's so hot, hitting into the wind, the ball is still going a good distance.  The wind probably made it better with the heat.  Dry off a bit.
