   PETER FOWLER:  No breeze early and it was a good first round. That was the most confident I've felt in my game for a long time and it was pretty automatic. I knew which shot to hit and I was pretty decisive. That 67 was the worst score I could have hit today. 
 I had a good month off over Christmas and stayed down under and played in Australia and New Zealand and worked hard with my original coach, especially on my putting. He's known me since I was 12 years old and he knows my game inside out. Ian Alexander is my coach. I did my apprenticeship under him. He's retired now and plays in seniors events. I've had some really good help from other coaches but I said: I'm struggling, mate, and I need some help. It helped me in the Open Qualifying which was only two days later. I played some great courses the last few weeks. 
 If I can get game, I will play in Europe. On my ranking I will get about 12 starts. I play to make money so if I can get a few invites it would help. It's great I am in the Open, and I will stay on after that.
