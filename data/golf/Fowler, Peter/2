 Q.  All right.  So you had five birdies today.  Things started working pretty good for you today.  What was different compared to yesterday?  
PETER FOWLER: I guess another look at the golf course.  I felt poorly in the heat yesterday, so that didn't help.  But I had to have a good one today anyway to have a chance at playing the weekend.  So I was happy to -- my putting was very good today and the short game.  So that was really the difference.   
 Q.  You teed off in the afternoon yesterday, correct?  So do you think it was any different coming out here in the morning?  You didn't really beat the heat because it was kind of hot throughout the day, but it was a little better than it was yesterday for you?  
PETER FOWLER: I was happy to see the breeze.  I thought it might have been humid without the breeze, but we had a nice breeze.  It didn't seem as hot out there.  I felt better.  It didn't seem as hot as yesterday.  But a couple weeks in this heat beats you up.   
 Q.  It does.  Peter, thank you.  Appreciate it.  Good luck.  
PETER FOWLER: Thank you.
