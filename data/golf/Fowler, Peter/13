   PETER FOWLER: Couple of hip surgeries on the right hip.

 Q. When were they?
 PETER FOWLER: Between March and December '09.

 Q. With your record, is that a factor this year, the other people see your name? 
 PETER FOWLER: I think they know I'm playing well. But I don't think it's going to stop them from doing their job. (Inaudible).

 Q. Doing your job as well as -- any thoughts of going to the Champions Tour?
 PETER FOWLER: Having played all around the world, I'd love to play there. And actually experienced American golf on a longer term basis, I've gone there sort of every couple of years for a week or two. Played in tournament (inaudible) I've had a little bit -- my game wasn't in great shape. 
 It would be great -- I've always traveled. Traveled to Asia a lot. I've lived in England. I know how the rest of the world works. I don't really know how America works. But it would be great experience to play with Tom Watson on a regular basis. 

 Q. It's in your mind. 
 PETER FOWLER: It would be a lovely opportunity. Obviously when you play golf around the world, I really enjoy the different qualities of golf, Melbourne, the links, the Heathland, Asia, the different tournaments, different grasses, that sort of thing. And there's a lot of great players still playing here. Because of the money, there's a lot of great players still playing out here. That would be a great treat. I'm going to TOUR school. 

 Q. Where is TOUR school this year?
 PETER FOWLER: Florida or Arizona. I don't know. They haven't released anything. In any case, five or six spots. You better play well. But even if you get on the TOUR you've got to play well. You may know the courses. (Inaudible) I don't know the courses. That's to be seen. He's a world class player. It's great to see him playing and he's really enjoying it.

 Q. Who was your partner when you won the World Cup?
 PETER FOWLER: Wayne Grady.

 Q. Wayne Grady. You were very well winning that. '87, was it in '88?
 PETER FOWLER: '89. If the weather stays, this will be great.
