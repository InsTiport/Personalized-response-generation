 Q.   Do you want to talk a little about your round today from start to finish?   Up‑and‑down day?  
PETER FOWLER:   Oh, very up‑and‑down.   Yeah.   Sort of not very good driving today and I putted abysmally.  
   
 Q.   How was the course playing today?  
PETER FOWLER:   Good.   Playing good.   Very good.   Not much wrong.   It's playing a good length.   The greens are difficult, although you can stop them on the green okay.   If you don't drive it in the fairway it makes it difficult.  
   
 Q.   The PGA.com writer is doing a feature story and they selected about 20 of you.   This is kind of a random question.   Are there a couple driving ranges that you've encountered throughout European the UnitedStates that kind of stand out, where you've practiced?   Is there any that kind of stand out in your mind?  
PETER FOWLER:   The American ones are probably the best facilities around the world.   The players demand good quality and you got a lot more green staff over here than you have around the world, so you probably got three or four times as many green staff.   So it's only natural that its better.  
   
 Q.   Is there any driving ranges that stick out over here in the UnitedStates?  
PETER FOWLER:   No, they're all fairly similar.   I think the best ones are ones that got bigger putting greens.   Some of them are too small and you can't fit more than half a dozen people on the putting green.   And chipping greens are far too small.   Chipping greens should be four times the size of a real green, but they usually are about a quarter of the size of a real green.   So I don't know why that is.   But because you can't practice, it's really difficult to practice shots inside of 60 yards.
