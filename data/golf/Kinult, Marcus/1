Q. 70, how pleased with the way you battled through that?
MARCUS KINHULT: Yeah, I'm happy with that. Didn't get off to a good start, 3-over after six, was it. I didn't play well, so I deserved that I felt like. But then I just found something and birdied the par 5s and holed two putts on the last two, which is great. Great finish. We're still in it.
Q. You mentioned the par 5s there. Those birdies on 9 and 10, how key were they?
MARCUS KINHULT: I think they were pretty important because, well, both of them are -- well, all four of them are gettable today in two. We laid up on two of them and still made birdie. That was good to get up-and-down for birdie.
Q. Looking at the closing holes here, some of the three hardest holes to finish ON Tour. To get back-to-back birdies on 17 and 18, how great for momentum going into tomorrow?
MARCUS KINHULT: Yeah, if you can hit those greens the last few holes, you are over the moon I think. I did that, and holed a long one on 17. I had something going the last couple days and made bogeys, so it's better.
Q. You had success earlier this year at the British Masters. How much are you going to draw on that experience heading into the final round?
MARCUS KINHULT: That seems a long time ago now, but of course to get that first win is kind of a relief. Yeah, we'll see about tomorrow. If we go out and play well, I think there's a chance, but always depends on what the guys are doing. If we can do our thing as good as possible, might be a chance.
