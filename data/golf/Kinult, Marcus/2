 Q.  3-under par 69. How would you assess the round?  
MARCUS KINHULT: Played well. Very similar to yesterday. Didn't make many mistakes. I think that was key. If you hit the fairway or the semi, the first cut is okay, but if you're wider than that, it's a struggle after.   
I played all right. Holed a few putts and I'm happy with the round.   
 Q.  Back-to-back 69s to sit at 6-under for the tournament. How pleased are you the way you were taking on this challenge for the first time?  
MARCUS KINHULT: I haven't played well here in South Africa before. This year, I had a few guys behind me, and last year I had no guys behind me. Quite an improvement and I feel better this year.   
 Q.  Do you feel making a par is more important than necessarily a birdie on some of those holes?  
MARCUS KINHULT: Yeah, there's a few tricky ones out there, especially with the wind we had the first two days here. The par 5s are gettable, so you can probably pick up some birdies there.   
The rest is quite tough, so to make a lot of pars to avoid all these mistakes, I think that's key.   
 Q.  And with the leaderboards tightening up, 6-under, what do you need to do now for the next couple round to make a push for title?  
MARCUS KINHULT: Depends on what the guys do. If I can play another two good, solid rounds, I think I could have a chance. You never know. I need to play really well, that's for sure. If I play well, maybe.
