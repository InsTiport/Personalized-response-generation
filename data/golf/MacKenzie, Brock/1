   NELSON SILVERIO: Can you just talk about your round a little bit, how it went? 
 BROCK MACKENZIE: Just another solid round. Lots of greens, lots of fairways, and made a couple good putts, couple good up-and-downs. 
 My whole strategy coming into the week was just to hit fairways, and if I can hit fairways, and if I can make some putts, so be it. So I played tee to green really solid and made some key putts. So it's been good so far.
 NELSON SILVERIO: Questions? 

 Q. I remember you told me yesterday that you could be in for a bit of a test. Did you get that today?
 BROCK MACKENZIE: Well, I mean, you know, I had a good round yesterday, so it was nice to back that up, you know, being tied for second, whatever I was after yesterday, to come back and play another solid round. So hopefully I can just keep doing that on the weekend.

 Q. There was a couple of other Canadian Tour players with you today, and a couple of them with Tim and Spencer Levin. This tour is kind of making some noise here at the Open. 
 BROCK MACKENZIE: Yeah. It's good. It's good to see. It's not surprising to me. I know that we have some really good players. There's so many good players all over the world, and you just need to take advantage of some opportunities when you're given them, and this is a great opportunity for me to do something; and so far, so good.

 Q. Talk about Adam Hadwin. You haven't seen him play. He hasn't played with you so far in this tournament, but if you can just comment on how he's performed on the Canadian Tour. 
 BROCK MACKENZIE: Played really solid. I know he's made the Top 10 almost every event, so obviously a really young, good player. 
 And I mean Canada keeps putting out some really good young talent, so he's definitely one of them. 
 NELSON SILVERIO: Anything else? All right.
