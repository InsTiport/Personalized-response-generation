 Q. Talk about your day. 
 CLEVE COLDWATER: I made a birdie on the long par-3 13th after a bogey on 12. And I hit it in there about four feet and made that. 
 Then on the last hole I got it up-and-down it seemed like every hole on the front side. And then I hit one in there like maybe 14, 15 feet on number nine for my last hole of the day.

 Q. Is the course what you expected for a Senior PGA?
 CLEVE COLDWATER: I played it 15 years ago, probably, and I didn't know exactly where I was going, and I got my targets down a little bit better, but it's a very demanding golf course and very, very subtle. Very tricky. 
 So you had to be in control and I think the important thing is if you do hit a bad shot you got to get back on track as quickly as possible.
