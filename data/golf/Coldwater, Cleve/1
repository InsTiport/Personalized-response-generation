  Q. How did your round go today?  
 CLEVE COLDWATER: Not too bad. A little disappointing with my putter. I had a 4-putt and a 3-putt and a couple other little missed ones, otherwise it was great.   
  
  Q. How did the wind do?  
 CLEVE COLDWATER: The wind, you know, we have been playing in the wind all week, so we're kind of used to the wind so I don't think it's been that bad. I played this morning, so the wind wasn't up as bad as it might be this afternoon.   
  
  Q. And what do you think you'll try to improve on by tomorrow?  
 CLEVE COLDWATER: Trying to get a little bit better with the putter. And if I can do a little bit better with that, then my score might come down some.
