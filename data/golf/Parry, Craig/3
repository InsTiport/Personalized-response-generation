Q.
(Inaudible.)
CRAIG PARRY:  I think if you hit a poor shot and hit it in the bunker, you're going to have a little bit of a hard shot.  And at least the way it is at the moment, it's tougher than what we've had in the past.
Q.  Talk about the course setup.  Is it fair?
CRAIG PARRY:  It's very fair.  It's very fair.  You've got wide fairways.  If you don't hit the ball on the fairway you're going to have some type of penalty.  And you've just got to drive the ball well, hit good irons shots, and if you do hit it in the bunker, hopefully you get a good lie and you putt well.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
CRAIG PARRY:  The rough is very high.  I hit it in a couple of times, and was barely able to move it.
