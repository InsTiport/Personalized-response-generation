 Q.   How do you feel about your round today?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN:   Very exciting.   Come up only the first day.   I really excited to play today.   This is my first major event.  
   
 Q.   Were you able to soak in the atmosphere when you were going around, or were you very focused on your golf?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN:   I just focused on my swing and I just focus on how hard I played and how I put my ball on the fairway because if you miss it, it's tough.   Like I miss on hole No. 8.  
   
 Q.   What happened on 18?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN:   I missed my drive, yeah, I missed my tee shot on the left.   So it's easy to do.   I am lucky today I make a bogey on the last.  
   
 Q.   And what are your plans now?   Are you going to eat?   Are you going to go back to the hotel?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN:   I think I need more practice on the putting.   I hit really good today but so many missed putts today, so many missed opportunities today.  
   
 Q.   What does it mean to you to be here at the Open?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN:   You know, it's honour for me to play this really big events in entire golf, in history of golf.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel any more pressure?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN:   Yes, of course.   It's always a pressure, yeah.
