 Q.  What's with you and the UBS Hong Kong Open that you always come here and play well?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN: Maybe I just got lucky today.  I make birdie at the last three holes, 7, 8,9.   
 Q.  How were conditions out there?  Was it good for scoring?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN: I think so, yeah.  Today it's a perfect weather for golf, yeah.   
 Q.  And tell me a little bit about those three straight birdies.  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN: I had a good drive on hole No. 7.  Usually most players laid up there.  I hit a good drive, second shot, like one feet, and then make a birdie.   
Then hole No. 8, I missed a little bit left.  It's on the green-side but I managed to make a good putt there.   
I made a birdie again on hole No. 9.  I had a long birdie putt again coming up from the back, going back to the flag, and then got lucky on the last three holes, yeah.   
 Q.  When you come back to Hong Kong, do you always feel happy after finishing second, that few years ago?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN: Yeah, of course.  You know, Hong Kong, it's a memorable tournament for me.   
 Q.  What is it about the golf course that fits you?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN: I think this course, you know, if you hit like people hit straight, good putting, maybe can score very good on this course.   
 Q.  You've got a perfect start now, not too far off the leaders.  Does this sort of like set you the right mood for the next few days?  
JUVIC PAGUNSAN: We'll see.  You know, every day it's a different day.  So I just concentrate, just keep the ball in the fairway, make putts, if I have an opportunity.
