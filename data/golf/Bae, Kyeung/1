  Q. It got a little windy on the back 9.   
 KYEONG BAE: Yeah, it was real windy.  
  
  Q. Did it affect your back 9 at all?  
 KYEONG BAE: Well, no, actually. I tried to play with -- I have a really great knock-down shot. It is a strong part of my golf, which is iron shots.   
 I really play with wind like mentally. I didn't fight with the wind. That helped a lot to make good opportunity to make birdies.  
  
  Q. So overall, this is probably your best round of the week, would you say?  
 KYEONG BAE: Sure, I think so.  
  
  Q. Puts you in contention, I'd say.   
 KYEONG BAE: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Have you been watching the leaderboard?  
 KYEONG BAE: Oh, yeah.  
  
  Q. Always?  
 KYEONG BAE: Always.  
  
  Q. You probably haven't thought about tomorrow yet. I guess this puts you right in contention. Do you have a number in mind maybe or just wait and see how the leaders do?  
 KYEONG BAE: Well, I'm going to keep playing and try to pick my targets. That's my only goal and what I have to do. I will just play more like regular golf.   
  
  Q. Did the course -- I guess in the morning it was probably a little bit more receptive on the greens? They're a little harder?  
 KYEONG BAE: Yeah, the greens getting drier, so this way hard to make stop. I had good contact with ball today.   
  
  Q. You'd say it's probably going to be a little challenging for the players playing now as the wind blows and it dries out a little bit?  
 KYEONG BAE: I think so.
