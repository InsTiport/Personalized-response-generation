   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Thanks for joining us today.  Great round out there:  Bogey-free, 5-under.  Really climbed you up the leaderboard.  How does it feel to turn in a performance like that?   
 KYEUNG BAE:  Well, actually I had a really good putter today.  I really trusted my swing and enjoyed my game.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  Can we go over your five birdies?  I guess your first one was on 15.   
 KYEUNG BAE:  Yes.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  What club?   
 KYEUNG BAE:  Let me think about this.  I hit 6-iron I think.  It was into the wind, and then it was more like 15 feet.   
 And then 16 I made only about nine feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  What club?   
 KYEUNG BAE:  Oh, I hit pitching wedge.   
 Then 17 I hit 52 wedge for third shot.  It was nine feet I think.   
 And No. 18 I hit 8-iron and then it was more like five feet.   
 No.4 I hit 5-iron for second shot.  It think it was four feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  So you closed your back 9 with four straight birdies.   
 KYEUNG BAE:  Oh, yeah.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  How does that feel to make the turn?  What's going through your head at that time?   
 KYEUNG BAE:  Well, I didn't think that much at the time.  Just try to hit the flag and tried to make putts.  The green was a little faster than yesterday.  I play yesterday it was a little pour down rain, so after that it was a little slower.  It was a little confuse for me to make the speed.   
 But it was really pretty good speed for green and it helped me a lot.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  You're in the top 5 in the leaderboard.  Definitely going to make the cut.  What do you think going into tomorrow and who you might be paired with?   
 KYEUNG BAE:  Well, I don't care about who's going to play with me, but I'm going to trust my swing and trust my play again and enjoy my game.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Is there something that you like about this golf course here?  Obviously looks like you really had a hot streak on the back 9.  Is the back 9 and the front 9 very different?   
 KYEUNG BAE:  Just a little bit.  Not much different.  If I hit it really good -- I need to find a section.  They have a really hilly green and undulation section part, so I might need some more like hit like more right section and it's going to me more better chance to make a birdie.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  Good luck tomorrow.  Thanks for coming in.
