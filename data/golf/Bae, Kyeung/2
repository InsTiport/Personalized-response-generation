   MIKE SCANLAN: All right, KB, thanks for coming in. If you would, just talk about your day. You're at the top of the leaderboard, and it's gotta feel good to come out in the first round of the year and play so well.  
 KYEONG BAE: Yeah. I think so. When I played this morning, the weather was really windy, so it was hard to play, but I think it's a great way to start, and I really enjoyed it.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Can you talk about your off season? Did you work on anything?   
 KYEONG BAE: Yeah.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: You had a really good 2007 and then you didn't play as well last year. Did you do anything specific to help your game?  
 KYEONG BAE: Yeah. Actually, I focused my work out and my make up better body, like with strength. That helped a lot. And my tee shot was not really accurate. So I focused my tee shot accuracy rather than distance. So it helped a lot, I guess.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Questions?   
  
  Q. How were the conditions today?  
 KYEONG BAE: Yeah, the conditions are always good. The greens were a little softer than in practice rounds. The green was a little faster when I putted.  
  
  Q. What are your goals this year?  
 KYEONG BAE: Definitely I want to win, but I want to better play than 2008, 2007. That's one of my goals. And last thing I really want to try, about the golf course management.   
 I had pressure on myself, because I have to win and I have to be better than last year. That keeps my mind, I think. So I have too much greedy and too much thinking of my goals.  
  
  Q. Why was 2008 so difficult for you?   
 KYEONG BAE: I just changed my thinking, and less thinking and try to trust myself. It helps a lot, and around me, the friends and parents, everyone told me just relax and have fun first. So that really helped me.  
  
  Q. How do you change that? And are you trying to enjoy the game more?   
 KYEONG BAE: Yes. And not greedy. As I told you, be more modest.   
  
  Q. How many times did it rain on you today?   
 KYEONG BAE: Five, I guess.   
  
  Q. What was the hardest part?   
 KYEONG BAE: Light and heavy, light and heavy. Both of them.   
  
  Q. Do you just play through that?   
 KYEONG BAE: Yeah. I didn't try comfort. Just play, rain, windy or chilly, whatever.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Anything else? That was easy enough. Thanks for coming in.   
 KYEONG BAE: Thanks for having me today.
