 Q.  Had a great start to the year.  What do you credit this hot start to the year and a great first round?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, I've been working with him for a few years now.  He's really helped me kind of shallow out my swing path.  I was getting a little steep when I came back, that was our goal, to figure out a way for me to not only get injured, but then just shallow it out.   
 Q.  Talk about Bethpage.  I just talked to Lorenzo.  He said 1 through 18 is tough.  There is no one tough hole.  What do you think?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, he's absolutely right.  Any of the holes you miss the fairway or you miss the green, the rough is pretty tough.  You're chipping out pretty much on every hole if you miss the fairway.  You have some holes that are really long.  12's long, into the wind.  15 is really long, into the wind, I had 240 into one hole, and then 230 into the other.  And so you just have to make sure you're in the fairway first and then just hope you get (indiscernible).   
 Q.  Your driving accuracy today was really good.  Was there anything you work on the range, how can I work on my accuracy?  Do you do anything specifically maybe for this round as well?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, so ball position is really important for me, especially the way I hold the club, if I get the ball too far back, then I start missing it both ways.  So I really have to keep the ball towards my left toe, inside my left heel.  Then that really helps me to get some -- everything going on the target lines up with the ball, so there's no (indiscernible).   
 Q.  Congratulations on a good start.
