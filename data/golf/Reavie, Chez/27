 Q.  So I mean it's pretty tough conditions out there.  I know the wind died down a little bit.  What's the key to getting a good score out there today?  
CHEZ REAVIE: I hit the ball real solid.  Hit a lot of greens.  It's hard to hit the fairways.  Hit a lot of good tee shots that ended up in the rough.  Seemed to keep myself on the right side of the hole to give myself a chance to get it up and down when I missed the greens and, fortunately, I did.   
 Q.  What does this do to get off to a good start?  Lot of guys say it doesn't change their mindset.  Does it give you a little bit more to play with?  How do you approach the next three rounds?  
CHEZ REAVIE: I think most importantly I've seen good shots out of here.  I've hit the ball close to the hole.  I've hit good approach shots and tee shots.  Just trying to build on that in the week.   
 Q.  Any key shots in the round that stuck out to you?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Not really.  Lot of solid shots.  Second shot I hit on the last hole, hit a good tee shot and drifted in the lip of the bunker.  Hit a good shot onto the green to give myself a look.  That was a good par to just to kind of keep the momentum going.
