 Q. You shoot a 68, we're all like trying to keep our noses warm here. 
 CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah. It was cold (indiscernible). 
 It was great. I got the putter going. It was a little shaky early. I made a nice long putt on the par-5 for par after hitting it in the water. (Indiscernible).

 Q. So many guys in a bad position this week. You're not one of them. On the one hand (indiscernible). 
 CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah. I'm out here trying to hit it as low as I can (indiscernible) this year, but I'm just trying to score low whether I have to or not. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CHEZ REAVIE: It was, yeah. I'd love to go back. 

 Q. Tell me where things started going for you. You just got hot, playing there, playing today, bringing it back East to finish things off. How do you feel about it?
 CHEZ REAVIE: I feel great about it. My game started in Greensboro. (Indiscernible). I'm still playing well, so I'm just going to try to ride the momentum into next year and hope to make the Playoffs again next year.

 Q. That smile on your face is a good thing. Keep going.
