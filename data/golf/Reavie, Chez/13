 Q.  Chez, how pleased are you with that round, especially nice bounce-back there at the end?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, you know, I played solid today.  Made some good putts.  Unfortunately made two bogeys.  One ball ended up in Brian's little divot in the bunker, so it was plugged even though it shouldn't have been plugged.   
Yeah, I hit the wrong club on 17.   
 Q.  I wondering about that 13 shot, because it's so unusual to see a shot like that come out.  Just a bad lie in there?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, yeah.  So he hit before me out of the fairway and he left his pitch mark in the bunker and then my ball hit up in the grass and rolled down into his pitch mark, and so that was unfortunate.   
But, hey...   
 Q.  That's golf there.  Talk about your ball striking.  I thought you hit some really shots tight there on the back nine.  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, yeah, it definitely got better as the round progressed, even though I knew I shot lower on the front nine.  I felt like my swing was better on the back.   
I had some good looks, and hopefully have some same looks.   
 Q.  Overall in position here at 5-under par, and that's what it's all about on Day One, isn't it?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, absolutely, especially around here.  It can get away from you in a hurry, so you are just trying to hit as many fairways as you can and give yourself some looks.
