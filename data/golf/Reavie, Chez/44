   CHEZ REAVIE: It was a great day. I played really solid. Anytime you're under par at a U.S. Open, you're doing well.

 Q. Any advantage going out early?
 CHEZ REAVIE: Especially, the greens softened up. It made the rough tougher, but if you kept it out of the rough, you have an advantage.

 Q. You're a year out from reconstructive surgery?
 CHEZ REAVIE: Everything feels great. Every once in a while it will swell up, but I ice it and wake up the next day doesn't feel great.

 Q. You think 1-under later in the day is still going to be in the lead?
 CHEZ REAVIE: It won't be in the lead, but it will be close enough for the lead. Anytime you're under par it's great. 
 The rough is tough and the greens are getting firmer and the wind is picking up. It's going to be tough this afternoon.

 Q. Do you kick yourself for dropping a couple of strokes late?
 CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, that bogey on 17 hurt, especially when I hit it in the middle of the fairway. I only had an 8-iron into the green. I left myself in a tough spot, which stinks, but, you know, we managed.

 Q. Was the course playing -- were the greens softer than you thought they'd be?
 CHEZ REAVIE: With the rain, yeah, they were a little softer, but it's Thursday. They've got plenty of time to dry them out.
