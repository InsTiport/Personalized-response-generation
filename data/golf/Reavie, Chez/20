 Q.  Are you going to do much scoreboard watching tomorrow or see how it shakes?  
CHEZ REAVIE: I'm just going to play.  I'm outside the numbers so I need to go play well and nothing is going to change for me.  I got to go play as good as I can.   
 Q.  Is there any difference in the pressure you might feel for a round like tomorrow versus typical final round?  
CHEZ REAVIE: I mean there's definitely something else there, right, it's something I play for, goal at the beginning of the year always to get to the Tour Championship but for me it's being outside the number.   
I just have to go play well and kind of see where I shake out.  Lot of it depends, too, on how the guys play that are between me and that number, anyways.   
Lot of it is out of my hands, anyway.
