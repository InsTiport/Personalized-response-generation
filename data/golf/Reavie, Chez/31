Q. What do you got to do tomorrow to give yourself a chance?
CHEZ REAVIE: Just keep striking the ball well.  Obviously today was strange, it got tricky with the fog and wind, especially when I was in the open holes.  So I just tried to stay patient and I made some bogeys early and they were 3-putts but it was playing tough.  So I stayed patient and was able to make some birdies coming in.
Q. A lot of FedExCup points available with a good finish tomorrow.  What would that do for your season?
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, it's always nice, when you're playing well during the week and to finish strong on Sunday is a good way to finish.  Sometimes you have a good week and then you don't play so great Sunday and you kind of feel like you lost a little bit.
So, yeah, it's just I've been playing solid and hopefully just go play solid again tomorrow and keep climbing the board.
Q. 70 yesterday at Pebble?
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah.
Q. What do you got to do to go a little lower?
CHEZ REAVIE: When I shot 2-under, it was mainly my putting, I hit the ball well, I had a lot of good looks and I just missed a few putts.  So if I can go out there tomorrow and have no 3-putts and make a few putts and hopefully shoot a low number.
