Q.   2â€‘under par, 69, are you happy with that?
CHEZ REAVIE:   Yeah, anything under par out here today is a great score.   The greens are firm and we got fortunate with the wind.   It was a little windy but I don't think it was as windy as this morning. 

Q.   Three birdies against one bogey, very steady play, what do you account for that?
CHEZ REAVIE:   I hit proper clubs off the tees.   I've been around here a few times now, so I can kind of figure out my angles for the approaches to the greens.   I'm giving myself a little more wiggle room with my tee shots.

Q.   It didn't seem like you guys got the bad end of the weather today?
CHEZ REAVIE:   It was cold this morning.   It was cold enough for me to have a sweater on even when we teed off this afternoon.   But after a few holes it was warm enough to take it off, and it was a great day.

Q.   Hard, fast conditions, you like them or not so much?
CHEZ REAVIE:   Yeah, it's great.   With the greens being firm, you have to hit good golf shots into the greens.   If you miss it a little bit, it will bounce off the greens and God only knows where it will end up, so you need a good, crisp iron shot.
