Q. Chez, good round of golf.  Way to go.  Second best round of the day, 63 bogey free.  You gotta be pretty psyched about that.
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, yeah.  It was a solid day.  I really just kind of kept it on the proper side of the holes.  I hit a lot of shots that were kind of just on the fringe or kind of just on the first cut.  So I had some tough shots getting close, but I didn't get greedy and just kept it on the right side.
Q. Talk about the game right now.  You won last year in the Web.com playoffs.  You're healthy.  Do you feel really good about things right now?
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah.  Everything feels great.  It's nice waking up not having aches and pains and trying to figure it out every day.  I'd say the last four or five months I've been that way, and I've been consistently feeling well, which helps me just consistently try and improve my golf swing.
Q. Talk about the weekend now.  Obviously you gotta go low.  Play aggressive out of the gates starting tomorrow?
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah.  I think it's just more of the same.  This course, if you hit good tee shots, get in the fairways, you can be real aggressive.  So you just have to pick your spots.  If you kind of just miss the fairway, even though you hit a good shot, just kind of play the fat side of the green and give yourself a chance, and then when you do hit fairways, go at the flags with your wedges.
Q. How excited are you about the weekend?  You got a chance to win this thing.
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, you know, it's great.  It's going to be a lot of birdies, like you said, but I just gotta keep plugging along and hopefully hit as many fairways as possible to give myself chances.
Q. Great round today.
CHEZ REAVIE: Thanks.
