  Q. Are you where you want to be for tomorrow?   
 CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, you know, I played really solid today. Had a couple three-putts on the back nine. But besides that, I played well.  
  
  Q. Explain the scenario on 17, if you could?  
 CHEZ REAVIE: You know, it was just too dark. You know, it was actually dark on 16. Because the green is kind of tucked behind the trees there, and the pin was back left. I went ahead and hit it anyway. When we got up to 17, I didn't want to putt, it was too dark to read my putt.  
  
  Q. How much of a momentum stealer is it to get up and play and then wait?   
 CHEZ REAVIE: I'm not really thinking about that to be honest with you. I've got to be back here 7:30 to finish, and that's what I'll do. Then I'll get some rest.   
 Somehow I'll figure out what to do after to get ready for my final round.  
  
  Q. So it was your decision then?   
 CHEZ REAVIE: No, it was a group decision. Actually, Eric Axley went ahead and finished his round or his putt on that hole. But Brian Davis and I didn't want to hit it. We figured we have to play 18 in the morning. What is finishing 17 in the first and then starting 18?   
  
  Q. (No microphone)?  
 CHEZ REAVIE: Anthony and I play different games. He hits the ball really long and I don't. So I need to stick to my game plan, hit fairways and greens and give myself opportunities to make birdies.  
  
  Q. Have you seen Anthony play?   
 CHEZ REAVIE: Oh, yeah. You can't miss it. He's won a couple of times. He's won great tournaments to start, and here he is playing great again. It's not a surprise at all, he's a great player.  
  
  Q. (No microphone)?  
 CHEZ REAVIE: You know, it's not really proving it to them. I want to win a golf tournament. I've wanted to win golf tournaments since I was 12 years old. It's just on a little bigger stage now.
