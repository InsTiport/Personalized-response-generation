 Q.  Last week we were talking after you lost in that playoff.  You put yourself right back in the mix this week.  We were talking about specifics.  For you, what's been the key to this recent success?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Right.  Well my ball striking's always been steady now for a few years.  It was just trying to figure out how to get the results.  Putting obviously is very important in that, but just picking your spots and playing aggressive at the right times.   
 Q.  You also were talking about being able to be patient and last week when we were talking on the green you said I'm going to be able to take this momentum and roll it into next week.  But mentally how challenging is it to play at this high of a level back-to-back?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, the hardest part was, I wasn't physically tired, just mentally I made some mistakes just because I think I was a little tired mentally.  Fortunately I recognized that and just tried to get some more rest and relax and here we are.   
 Q.  Same question.  What are the positives that you can take away from here rolling into the next few events?  
CHEZ REAVIE: I hit the ball well, not quite as well as last week, but I made more putts this week.  Whenever you're making putts it's a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Excellent play again this week.  Just comment about the momentum you're riding right now?  
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, it's been great.  I've been hitting the ball well for awhile and just haven't quite been piecing it together and I think I figured out a way to piece it together.  And biggest thing is just making less bogeys, making less bogeys, every birdie I make almost counts as double, so that really helps.
