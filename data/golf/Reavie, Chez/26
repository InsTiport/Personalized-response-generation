Q. Chez, always fun to birdie last hole, 6-under, no bogies on the card.  Your thoughts on how you played today.
CHEZ REAVIE: It was a solid day hit a lot of good slots, hit a lot of greens.  Couple greens I missed I was in a good spot to get it up-and-down.  Good solid day.
Q. Tell me about the shot at 12.  You hole out for eagle.  ShotLink said it was about 99 yards.  Take us through that shot.
CHEZ REAVIE: It was 102 yards.  Pretty much no wind.  It was a perfect 58-degree wedge, and I hit it good.  Watching it go in is always fun, but I hit a good shot.
Q. What was it like out there, the humidity you get out here, it's like 90 percent, the mist and rain?
CHEZ REAVIE: You have those elements, but the wind wasn't blowing terribly hard.  If the wind was blowing hard, it would be hard.  With the mist, the air is just a little heavy, you can handle that.  If the wind were to start blowing, it would be difficult.
Q. Just thoughts overall on your game heading into the second round?
CHEZ REAVIE: I've been hitting the ball well all year.  Want to get the putter going.  When I make a few putts, I shoot rounds like I did today.  Unfortunately some days the putter is not so hot.  If I can keep the putter hot, that will be good.
