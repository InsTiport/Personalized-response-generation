 Q. Here with Chez Reavie. Ten birdies and four bogeys. Just not a big fan of par.
 CHEZ REAVIE: It wasn't, especially on the front nine. It was a definitely a rollercoaster. We had a lot of fun out there.

 Q. When you see the scores, and you know how low they're going out here, how does it change the mindset and the mentality?
 CHEZ REAVIE: The biggest thing for me is just staying patient. Once I start stressing and trying to make birdies I don't, so as long as I stay patient -- even though I made a few bogeys I stayed patient and I made birdies right after. 

 Q. Still, a lot of guys who are rookies, as the Money List is concerned this time of year, you don't have those because you're winner of the Canadian Open. How much does that free you up to just play? 
 CHEZ REAVIE: Bigtime. You know, I don't think about it at all. I see by buddies out here really working hard, and really -- I can tell they're not their normal, carefree attitude. 
 Fortunately I don't have to feel that way, but I'm rooting for them at the same time to keep their card.

 Q. You're a young man. I take it you got to love it that Justin Timberlake is on board this year. 
 CHEZ REAVIE: Absolutely. I can't wait to go to the concert tonight. It's gonna be a blast.
