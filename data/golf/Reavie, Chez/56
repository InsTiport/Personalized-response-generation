 Q.  What was the key today for such a clean round? 
 CHEZ REAVIE:  You know, I was striking the ball real well, and when I did miss a green, I missed it in the right spot so I could get up-and-down. 

 Q.  Could you see the conditions getting any harder or difficult later in this week? 
 CHEZ REAVIE:  You know, absolutely.  They actually watered the greens a little bit.  When I played on Tuesday they were much firmer and a little crustier, so they watered them for us a bit, thank God.  But I'm sure by Sunday they'll be nice and firm again. 

 Q.  How has your game been the last month?  Were you kind of expecting yourself to be in a position like this pretty soon? 
 CHEZ REAVIE:  Yeah, actually I took a couple weeks off after the PODS Championship.  I was a little tired and needed to work on my game.  I had two good weeks with my coach Peter Kostis, and we sorted some things out, and luckily I played well. 

 Q.  How many different ways has someone butchered your name since you've been on the PGA TOUR? 
 CHEZ REAVIE:  You know, up here it hasn't been too bad.  Usually they ask if they don't know, but I get a lot of things.
