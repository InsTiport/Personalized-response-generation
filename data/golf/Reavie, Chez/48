   On competing at THE PLAYERS Championship for the first time
 CHEZ REAVIE: It's a great tournament. It's one of the tournaments I always made sure to watch while I was at home so it's nice to finally be here and play 17 and 18, all the fun holes you've seen guys play well on when they go on to win.
 On following this tournament and watching it growing up
 CHEZ REAVIE: I did follow it while I was growing up. I remember watching Adam Scott win in 2004 when I was finishing up college and looking to turn pro. I remember he had to get it up and down from the fairway for par on 18 to win. The excitement watching him win that week was definitely motivating.
 On playing the 17th hole for the first time this week
 CHEZ REAVIE: I played it Monday. It's a great hole. It wasn't so tough Monday because it was Monday and there was no wind. It's amazing how difficult it can get when there's just a five mile-per-hour wind blowing. 
 On his mindset standing on 17 tee in his first competitive round
I'll try to do the same things I did in practice. I'll pick my target and try to focus on that and not all of the people watching.
