 Q.   Between the time you got up this morning and your first birdie today, how do you stay patient for that long?  
CHEZ REAVIE:   It was a tough day.   Wind was gusting different miles per hour and made it tough.  
Even though I didn't make many birdies early, I had a lot of pars and got up‑and‑down from some good spots and kept the momentum going and I finally got a few birdies to drop.   
   
 Q.   At some point, you had to realize, you make 70 today; that's an awfully good score.   
CHEZ REAVIE:   Yeah, anything under par today, even par, or anything around par is a good score.   I don't know what the wind is supposed to do this afternoon, but for these morning guys, if they are around par, they are happy.  
   
 Q.   And it was a little chilly this morning.   
CHEZ REAVIE:   It was.   I wasn't ready for it.   I had to put my rain jacket on for a little while.   But it warmed up once the sun came out a little bit.   
   
 Q.   How are you feeling?  
CHEZ REAVIE:   I feel good.   Everything feels great.   I'm really happy and I'm starting to make some putts and that always feels good, so I'm excited.   
   
 Q.   Nice little up‑and‑down, that chip had a chance to go in at 9.   
CHEZ REAVIE:   Yeah, it was close.   Had a little heat on it.   Luckily the line was good and I got it up‑and‑down.
