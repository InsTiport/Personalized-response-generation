Q. Is that the low round you've had on this, in this tournament?
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, pretty close, if not the lowest, definitely tied for lowest probably.
Q. Just some highlights, what was really working well for you?
CHEZ REAVIE: I hit just about every fairway, I think I missed one fairway, I missed number 8 just to the right.  But being in the fairway really helps you into these greens because they're so firm, so you can get enough spin on the ball to hold the greens.
Q. Have you felt pretty good about your game coming into this week then?
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, I've been playing really solid.  I didn't make a whole lot of putts in Hawaii and Palm Springs, but I've really been striking the ball well and fortunately I made a few this week.
Q. What would it mean to you to win?
CHEZ REAVIE: Oh, it would be awesome.  This is my home tournament, growing up here my whole life and coming to the tournament and carrying the sign board.  So this is like the fifth Major for me, so I'm excited to be playing well.
Q. You got Jon and Phil up there at 7-under, exciting weekend for Sun Devil Nation?
CHEZ REAVIE: Yeah, hopefully we'll all keep it going and we'll finish 1, 2, 3 on Sunday.
