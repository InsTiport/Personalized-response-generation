ROB LABRITZ: A three-putt on 6.
Q. I didn't see what you did.
ROB LABRITZ: Three-putt.  I had 40, 45 feet, and I hit the hole.  And it was -- had about six feet by, and then it just didn't make it coming back.  I mean, I played good today.  I did what I wanted to do, come out, shoot under par.
Q. You had a 2-under for the day.
ROB LABRITZ: I had 2 today.  Then I had one little hiccup, hiccup on 10.  I played solid.  We'll see if three more guys --
Q. What is this -- how do you describe what will occur now for the next couple hours or whatever it's going to be?  How is that -- just in your -- is it stressful?  How do you describe it?  It's out of your control.  Last five hours have been in your control.
ROB LABRITZ: That's a good point.  I'm not the guy who's going to kick himself.  I've learned over the years not to kick myself.  I shot what I shot.  We'll see if it's good enough.  Played my heart out.  Go from there.
Q. What's your emotion right now?  Are you stressed?  Is there a little bit of butterflies?  Are you excited, possible it does go to 3?
ROB LABRITZ: All of the above.  If it goes to 4.  All the above.  I'm excited.  I'm definitely not stressed.  I'm not going to do that to myself.  Waste of energy.
Q. How did it feel when you got (indiscernible)?
ROB LABRITZ: Comfortable.  Very comfortable.  I just said I'm starting to hit the groove.  You asked me yesterday how long did it take for the nerves to kick in.
Q. You said 4.
ROB LABRITZ: It was 4 I felt really good after 27.  It felt really good after 27.  I started striping it, playing good.  We'll see.  We'll see.
Q. The second time that you -- but the first tee shot in a major, right?
ROB LABRITZ: Yes.
Q. But it meant a lot probably now more than the others, probably?
ROB LABRITZ: Yeah, out of this home.  And this means a lot to me.  This guy right here.  This is what I wrote in my article.  Robbie Risman.
Q. It says:  Keep grinding always, but look around and enjoy the ride.  Where did that come from?
ROB LABRITZ: One of my members, my first major that I qualified for, Hazeltine, he left me a great bottle of champagne, and he left a note.  Probably one of the nicest notes I ever received.  And he passed away a few years ago.  It's words I live by.
Q. What was his name?
ROB LABRITZ: Robbie Risman.  He was just a member and --
Q. Passed away a few years ago.  Car accident?
ROB LABRITZ: Yeah.  And the world's a worse place because he's not here.  But that's why, when you guys ask me these questions, I'm just a happy guy.
Q. But you carry with that with you all the time.
ROB LABRITZ: It's going to be in every book I ever have.
Q. Describe what your feeling was when you walked off 6.  As you walked to the 7th tee, which is no (indiscernible) what's going through your mind?  How much is the (indiscernible)?
ROB LABRITZ: One shot at a time.  Start letting your brain drift, and then all of a sudden you start doing crazy things.  Playing the game, you guys know, my whole life.
Q. And you're old.
ROB LABRITZ: I am old.  It's learned skill of just kind of staying in the moment.  And that's what I'm going to do for the rest of the day.
Q. When you think about No. 7, talked about it before the tournament (indiscernible) should be a par 4, whatever, the tees were a little bit off to the to right.
ROB LABRITZ: Little bit.
Q. Not all the way to the back.
ROB LABRITZ: No.
Q. But that is a daunting par 4.
ROB LABRITZ: Good par 4.  I drive a 5-iron in there today.  Just past the hole.  Pretty good shot.
Q. Did you have any real good birdie looks on the last three?
ROB LABRITZ: 8, 9 I did.  I hit all greens.  9 was 30 feet.  That's the closest.  The other ones were just outside of 30.  And then the one on 6 I three-putted was actually 45 feet.
