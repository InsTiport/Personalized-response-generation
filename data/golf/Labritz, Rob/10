ROB LABRITZ:   I struggled on my front nine which is the back nine.  I didn't hit any fairways, and, at least a bogey.  I got up-and-down pretty well.  Made a mental error and didn't get up-and-down on 17 which was my only real bad hole and made double. 

Other than that, I played pretty decent. 


Q.  Was the rough never such that you just had to chip out? 

ROB LABRITZ:   There was a couple, if you missed it far enough left.  I missed it far enough left a couple of times where you actually had a shot.


Q.  Because it was trampled down? 

ROB LABRITZ:   Yeah.  That's the way you have to miss it, you have to miss it big.  I missed a couple fairways by an inch or two, and you can't go anywhere.  I played decent. 


Q.  So you feel good heading into tomorrow? 

ROB LABRITZ:   I would say from an A to F, it was a C-minus game.  I struck it well on the front nine, which is my back and that will give me some good thoughts for tomorrow.
