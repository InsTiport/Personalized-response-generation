 Q. Evaluate, your third trip and overall performance compared to those previous trips?
 ROB LABRITZ: Overall felt real comfortable out there. I struck the ball good. Made some nice putts. I had two doubles today unfortunately, which will add up to 73, but made a bunch of birdies and just felt comfortable. So I like the golf course. I've just got to figure out that tee shot on 18.

 Q. What was the issue on that? 
 ROB LABRITZ: You know, even in the practice rounds, I probably hit ten golf balls off that tee, each time, and I don't think I've hit the fairway but once. 

 Q. It's essential, isn't it?
 ROB LABRITZ: Yeah, that's the one hole that you have to hit and I have to figure out a way to do it.

 Q. A lot to work on or do you think you can shore up a few things and you'll be all right for tomorrow?
 ROB LABRITZ: I feel like my putting is right on, speed is good. Putt was a little slow coming up 18 here, but my speed is good. Driving the ball well, hitting the irons crisp. I feel good. 

 Q. Your feelings about Whistling Straits as compared to Pete Dye's course, the radical change for you?
 ROB LABRITZ: Yeah, between this and French Lick, target golf. He's a big target golf guy. A little more demands on length here than at French Lick because they had some areas at French Lick where you could hit 3-wood because it was so narrow. This is a golf course that you have to hit it long and straight. If you hit it off-line, the rough is not too-too bad, it's a little nappy in places, but not too bad. 

 Q. How was your patience today?
 ROB LABRITZ: Great. I just putted a lot, hung out with my family, ate a bunch of food and worked on the speed of the greens but it was good.
