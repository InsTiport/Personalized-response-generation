 Q. Could be better, could be worse, what was it like? 
 JEAN-FRANCOIS LUCQUIN: Honestly I'm very proud of my game today again. Just I missed a few shots, especially on the fifth. I pushed the driver in the rough. The lie as okay, and I tried to hit a 6-iron, but it was a deep rough but it was wet, as well. The clubface was closed at impact and that's why the ball didn't fly, and I made a double-bogey. 
 It was hard to accept, but after that, you know, I knew my game was in position, and I kept fighting on the course. I had a beautiful finish, birdie at 15, 16, 17 and almost on 18, so I'm very happy today, yeah.

 Q. And playing with Robert today. 
 JEAN-FRANCOIS LUCQUIN: Yeah, he's playing so good, and he's top 20 in the world and I understand why now. It's not over yet, and we'll see tomorrow. I'm going to try to do my best tomorrow and we'll see what's going to happen.
