 Q. Congratulations for your victory, you still on cloud nine?
 JEAN-FRANCOIS LUCQUIN: It's unbelievable, since last week, it's like a dream and I don't realise at the moment, but you know, that's why I think it's very good to play in other tournaments, especially here, the course is perfect. Lots of good players, and just today was just play my game and it was perfect. Maybe I missed maybe one shot today, and I had a good pace on the green, and yeah, I made a very good score and I'm very happy. 

 Q. What were you thinking going out this morning? Did you think that 6-under is out there for the taking? 
 JEAN-FRANCOIS LUCQUIN: I don't know, you know, I didn't want to put any pressure, and I just thought to myself, just play golf, play golf, and we'll see, but you know, I want to make a good score today, because here, it's a big tournament, and there's a lot of good players and I'd like to have a good finish as well this week before my week off, and so I'm going to keep going like this, I hope so, and we'll see what happens at the end of the week.
