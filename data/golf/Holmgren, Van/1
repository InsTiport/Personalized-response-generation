Q. Not a lot of red out there on No. 2.  What were you seeing and how do you felt like you played?
VAN HOLMGREN: Middle of the green and I was going to let my putter do the work, which it did.  Tee shots were a little shaky but I just got real comfortable with my putter, hit the lines that my caddie gave me and it worked out.
Q. And what are your thoughts heading into tomorrow?
VAN HOLMGREN: Oh, God, I need to put myself in better spots off the tee because I hit my approach shots really well but I feel good, if my putter stays hot I'm looking to create some danger.
Q. Did you play No. 4 during practice rounds?
VAN HOLMGREN: Yeah.
Q. And how did you play?
VAN HOLMGREN: I played well.  Just, again, middle of the greens and letting the putter decide my fate.
