 Q. Mr. Norman, could I just get your thoughts on the round real quick?
 GREG NORMAN: Well, I got off to a bad start and that was it. Not much more I could say, really. 

 Q. Is all the travel you do outside of golf, do you think that ever factors in on how you play on the course?
 GREG NORMAN: Not at all. My play affects how I play on the golf course.
