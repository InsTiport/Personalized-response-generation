 Q. Your match today, obviously a tough finish, but some general thoughts. 
 TIM CLARK: We played good. Obviously they didn't play as good as they had the first two days. We hung in there, putting some pressure on them, hitting it in close; and on 17, had a chance to -- looked like a putt to win the match, but that didn't happen. 
 Then Tiger hit a great shot on 18. You know, just one of those matches. 

 Q. Seemed like you got off to a good start and your combination was working well. What was it that kind of let you down, do you think? 
 TIM CLARK: Nothing really. They made a few birdies in the end and they made some great saves. There were times when we could have gone 3-up, but they managed to get the ball up-and-down to stay within range. So I think that was key for them. Had they lost another hole, it would have been a different story. 

 Q. You had the advantage, how difficult is that? 
 GREG NORMAN: It's tough. I know when I went to Japan, it's hard to express what you would like to have happen. You have to have a lot of admiration and respect for Ryo to get over the culture, come over here, different foods, different lifestyle, different language. I'm very, very impressed with both of them.
