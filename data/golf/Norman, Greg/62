 Q. Were you pleased with your performance so far?
 GREG NORMAN: Yeah, very happy with it. Felt like really good round today, even though we played in the worst of conditions. I played very nicely. I was three to four strokes better today, more of a realistic number. But anyway, I can't complain. The course has been good to me. Keep going.

 Q. One of the things about this tournament, it's a good preparation for next week. Do you feel like it is now?
 GREG NORMAN: Well, not from the playability of the golf course. I think it is from the mental aspect. You got to hit the shot. The pin position at Redstone is tough. Environment is tough. When you get out in the driving range, it seems like a no-brainer you can hit shot after shot. You get into rhythm and bring to the golf course the shots on the driving range. 
 You need to be a little bit more cautious with that on the golf course. Then when you mishit a shot on the driving range, you don't care about it. Here you got get it up and down. Here you have to be careful where you miss it. It's really good preparation mentally.

 Q. Thanks for your time. Good luck the rest of the way.
 GREG NORMAN: Thanks.
