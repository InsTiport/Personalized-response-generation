 Q. How did it go out there today?
 GREG NORMAN: I actually felt pretty good. I putted terribly but that's about it.

 Q. Any rust?
 GREG NORMAN: Who knows? I actually felt good. I hit one bad drive and took a double bogey and took three three-putts. 75 is a bit of a shock to me but that's my score and I've got to take it.

 Q. Tomorrow?
 GREG NORMAN: I better shoot 66. That's all I can say. 

 Q. It'll be a bit hot out there in the afternoon?
 GREG NORMAN: Same for everybody. We expect that. It's probably the coolest it's been this week. 35, 38 we've done it before.

 Q. How did you go compared to the way you thought you would go?
 GREG NORMAN: I played better than I thought I would do. The putter let me down and that was it. If I putted half decent, I would probably would have shot a 70. That's the way it is.

 Q. Such big greens here?
 GREG NORMAN: That's not the reason why. I didn't have any speed to my putts. It was short and past the pins. I had my share of three putts.

 Q. Practice putting in the afternoon?
 GREG NORMAN: No. I wouldn't do that. The putting green is a bit indifferent and there's no point in doing that.
