 FULLAUDIOINTERVIEW

  
Q. Not the finish you were expecting or hoping for, obviously?
  
GREG NORMAN: No. I played well today, just didn't  
make any putts.
 
  
Q. How tricky were the pin placements?
  
GREG NORMAN: I'm not going to make a comment on them.
 
  
Q. Wind. I heard wind was gusty out there. 
 GREG NORMAN: Wind gusted up every now and then; it would blow 10, 20 miles an hour and then it would stand still.
  
So it would just depend on where you were on the golf course, whether  
you were getting a good break or a bad break.
 
  
Q. Any wildlife sighting today?
  
GREG NORMAN: No, not today.
 
  
Q. Some of the players were saying the pins were placed right on  
the edge. 
  
GREG NORMAN: I'm not going to make a comment on the golf  
course. The USGA should know better. 
 
  
Q. Can you talk about 8 and 9?
 GREG NORMAN: 8, I just hit the wrong club and I thought the wind was a little bit when you're above the hole, it's impossible, and I was lucky to make a four.
  
And 9, probably just didn't hit the second shot as hard as I should  
have done and paid the price.
 
  
Q. You changed clubs on 9, didn't you, Greg, from up  
there. What did you go to?
  
GREG NORMAN: Seven to six. 
 
  
Q. With the altitude, are there a lot of adjustments you're  
making right as you're standing over the ball more so than you might  
make on a normal --
 GREG NORMAN: Yeah, because you're guessing where the wind is; the wind above the trees makes a big difference of hitting the ball high.
  
So, yeah, I've said this. You've got to be committed to what  
you're doing. You might be right and you might be wrong.  
It's sometimes a bit of a guessing game.
 
  
Q. What's it going to take tomorrow to get back in this?
  
GREG NORMAN: I have no idea. Just go play well I  
guess. 
 
  
Q. You're not feeling you're out of it. Only one guy made  
a break. Fred Funk made a break. 
  
GREG NORMAN: Well, we'll see what the weekend brings. 
 
  
Q. We're not used to seeing Sharks on the course. Are you  
used to seeing bears on the course?
  
GREG NORMAN: (Laughs). Yeah. We've seen many  
bears on the course. 
 
  
Q. Did you see the one today?
  
GREG NORMAN: No.
