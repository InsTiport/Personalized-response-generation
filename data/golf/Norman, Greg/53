 Q. Can we get a comment on the week?
 GREG NORMAN: No comment. 

 Q. Has your view of park land courses changed a little? You said earlier in the tournament that you enjoyed them. 
 GREG NORMAN: No. Yeah. I still like them.

 Q. What did you think of the setup this week?
 GREG NORMAN: It was good. 

 Q. Seemed like it was a little softer, that they set it up in hopes of getting them around --
 GREG NORMAN: Today? 

 Q. Well, yesterday and today. 
 GREG NORMAN: No, it was fair. I thought the course was set up very nicely for the whole week. Yeah. 

 Q. Where are you going to play next?
 GREG NORMAN: Don't know. 

 Q. Played enough golf for a little while?
 GREG NORMAN: No, no. No, I would like to play, but right now I just don't know which one I'm going to go play in. 

 Q. Well it's nice to have options. 
 GREG NORMAN: That's right. That's what my wife said to me last night. She said, you're lucky, very few people have choices like you have. And that's a good thing. 

 Q. See, that's why you married her. 
 GREG NORMAN: Exactly right. 

 Q. It puts it in perspective for you. 
 GREG NORMAN: Exactly right. So I'm just going to keep going, keep moving forward.
