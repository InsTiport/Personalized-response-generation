 Q. How does it feel to be in contention on a Sunday for the first time in quite awhile?
 GREG NORMAN: I wouldn't say I'm in contention. 7 shots back, you know, that's pretty tough. The damage was done on 18 and that was it, really. 

 Q. As tough as this course is you don't think that the two guys in front of you could have a 74, 75, you put up a 68 and you're right there?
 GREG NORMAN: Well, I'm not going to make any predictions. I just don't get any momentum going my way. As soon as I get going, then I fall backward. 

 Q. How much does that have to do with the amount that you've played, where you kind of get going a little bit and then you kind of fall back?
 GREG NORMAN: Oh, I don't know, I think you just got to get the ball rolling your way to get momentum going. 
 Sometimes you get a good break and all of a sudden you make a birdie. And you keep going and all of a sudden you shoot a good round. And I just don't feel like that's happening. 
 And that's the game of golf, not much you can do about it. 

 Q. A brutal lie on the 18th in the rough?
 GREG NORMAN: That's part of it, yeah.
