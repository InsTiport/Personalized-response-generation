Q.   Talk about the round today and what you thought.   What worked for you. 
GREG NORMAN:   I shot 72 and that was it.   Nothing really worked.   Very happy to get off the golf course shooting even par.   And that's just the way it is. 
I made five birdies and a bunch of bogeys, more 3â€‘putts than anything else.   It was just pure rust, that's all it was.   Just rusty, rusty, rusty. 

Q.   What are your expectations when you come out and play these events now?   Is it just fun?
GREG NORMAN:   It's just a fun week and I'm here for, I'm here for a certain reason and at the end of the day I'm just going to enjoy having a couple of good rounds and fun rounds with everybody, that's all.

Q.   Do you feel a lot of the competitive juices though?   Do you still get down on yourself out there or do you channel that out?
GREG NORMAN:   Not at all.   Not at all.   I mean it's not one that I'm worried about.   I'm not going to lose any sleep over shooting 72 tonight, I can tell you that.

Q.   What do you think about this course?
GREG NORMAN:   I did like the golf course.   There's a lot of charm about it and I liked the old push up greens and the bunkers are good.   Yeah, beautiful putting surfaces. 
So, yeah, I enjoyed playing here, no question about it.   It's an old style golf course.
