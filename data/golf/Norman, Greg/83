   GREG NORMAN: I'm not very happy to tell you the truth. There wasn't anything wrong with my game today. I felt like I even putted well but I just didn't make anything. I was very disappointed with 67 today.  
 The course was different as it was downwind it was across from left to right maybe hurting as you made the turn a little bit so you aren't driving it 400 yards. It played the way it should play today it was nice and even. You had to be careful on some tee shots but outside that if you played well you could easily shoot a sub 70 score.  
 I've got no idea if it will be good enough. You have to see how the guy finishes at the end of the day. If I played the way I played today and make a few more putts it should be fun tomorrow.  
 Today was better than yesterday. Today was really solid I drove the ball really beautifully and drove it long and I pretty much tried to play the distance I needed to hit them. I was very encouraged with today. When you walk the front tee and the breeze is right to left down you can really get up to these early holes all the way up to seven. Once you get to eight, nine and 10 and 11 it changes dramatically but I was playing well and I knew there were some shots I was going to have to be aggressive with today. And I was and hit them great I really just didn't capitalize on my round today. I think 67 was the worst score I could have made today.
