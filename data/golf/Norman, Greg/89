  Q. Talk about the day.   
 GREG NORMAN: Not feeling very good right now. I can tell you that. But I think that when I made birdie on 15, 16, I thought then -- I always thought I was too far behind the leaders and it didn't make any difference.   
 But it was nice to a point. Right up until 17 and 18.  
  
  Q. Yesterday we talked to you that you thought five shots back was going to be tough. Was there a moment earlier in this round when everybody was starting to come back more towards you did you start to think differently or did you keep that out of your mind?  
 GREG NORMAN: No, the golf course was tough. You never want to think about other people's play. If you get a little bit out of position on this golf course you pay the price.   
  
  Q. Does it change your mindset at all about maybe playing a little more golf?  
 GREG NORMAN: It might be go back the other way. It doesn't really -- it takes a lot out of you. I've done this for 35 years of my life and you just it's hard enough as it is, especially on a course like this.   
 I have no interest in putting a schedule together other than what I've already stated.   
  
  Q. What was the club, the second shot on 17, what was the club and what were you trying to do with that one?  
 GREG NORMAN: It was a 7-iron, a choked down 7-iron. I was just trying to chase it up about 160 yards short of the bunkers and to give myself a good pitch shot. And it came out way left.   
  
  Q. The grass turn the club over on you?  
 GREG NORMAN: Yeah, that's what it was.   
  
  Q. The first time you played four rounds in a while and in an event of this magnitude, did you enjoy the week?  
 GREG NORMAN: I always enjoy playing golf. It's nice to be out here.
