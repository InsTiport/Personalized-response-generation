 Q. You got off to a good start but probably mixed fortunes today I would imagine?
 GREG NORMAN: Yeah, just up and down, just all I can say.

 Q. Two birdies in the first three holes, you must have thought this was going to be a good day. 
 GREG NORMAN: No, I never think that, just not around this golf course. Hit a couple of loose shots and that was really it. Never really got the handle on the round at all.

 Q. What happened with the double on 7?
 GREG NORMAN: Thought I hit a good tee shot, ended up in the bunker and 3-putted for a 6. 

 Q. Easily done around here. 
 GREG NORMAN: Yeah, very easily done. 

 Q. You're 4-under, still in it, plenty of holes to go.
 GREG NORMAN: Oh, yeah, you can shoot low around this golf course. 

 Q. What about the delay this starting out? Was that difficult? 
 GREG NORMAN: No, we're used to it. We've done it before. 

 Q. And seeing Fred post a low number at the start, doesn't come into the thinking at all?
 GREG NORMAN: You have to play your own game, just try to shoot the best score you can and that was it. I'm just glad the day's over, that's all it is.
