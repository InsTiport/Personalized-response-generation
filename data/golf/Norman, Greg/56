 Q. Is this a difficult course to play on?
 GREG NORMAN: I didn't play well and I deserve the score I got.

 Q. How about your birdies today?
 GREG NORMAN: Birdie? 

 Q. Or your birdie I should say. 
 GREG NORMAN: I had one birdie and that was on the 15th hole and that was it. From about 12 feet. 

 Q. Any surprises on this course?
 GREG NORMAN: No, I just didn't play well. Simple as that. 

 Q. Adjustments to make for tomorrow?
 GREG NORMAN: Just wake up tomorrow morning. That's the only adjustment I need to make is to just wake up. I didn't play well. Didn't hit the ball well, didn't hit fairways, didn't hit greens, other than that it was great. 

 Q. That's why you shoot over par?
 GREG NORMAN: That's why you shoot over par, right.
