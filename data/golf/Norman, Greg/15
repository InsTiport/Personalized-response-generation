 Q. What did you say to Aaron Baddeley? 
 GREG NORMAN: Just keep your head high. I know he feels bad. He didn't hit the tee shot, and it's early days. That's also what I told him.
 The guys played extremely well. We had a good opportunity to really push all the way through today, and we didn't square all the matches and we are behind. We have to make sure, they do carry their head high and wake up tomorrow morning and start the whole day afresh.

 Q. You know the history of teams that are behind from day one, and it's not good; what do you say to your team? 
 GREG NORMAN: Well, the teams that are behind after day one, it's not very good, so you have to go in there and focus. 
 You have to forget about what happened today. It's like any golf tournament, you have to look forward, not back. It is what it is. We have the ability to go out there and win more points. So I'm going to get the boys just to relax and focus on that, and don't really get down on yourself. Day one is day one; it's a four-day event.

 Q. Any change of plans for tomorrow? 
 GREG NORMAN: We had a few changes in our pairings anyway, so we'll find out in a few minutes.
