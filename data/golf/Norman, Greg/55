  Q. Can I get a couple quick thoughts? You didn't have any bogeys through 15. What was your feeling for your first part of the round?   
 GREG NORMAN: Good.   
  
  Q. What happened on 16 there?  
 GREG NORMAN: I just pulled a sand wedge a little thin and went back down unplayable.   
  
  Q. What's your mindset now heading into the weekend?  
 GREG NORMAN: I don't know if I'm going to make the cut, so I have to wait and see.
