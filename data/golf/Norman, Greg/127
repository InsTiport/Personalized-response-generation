Q.  Do you feel close to being back to your old form?

GREG NORMAN:   Well, I don't want to jump to things too quickly.  This is only my third round.  I feel great.  I feel pretty good.  It's just a matter of getting a comfortable feeling on the golf course.  It's good to be playing a tough golf course and hitting some good shots towards the end.  So, all of the signals are pretty good right now.


Q.  Are you surprised the way the leaderboard is shaping up going into tomorrow's round? 

GREG NORMAN:   Not really.  The golf course is there to be had today.  You'd expect them to shoot 66s and 65s out here, because there's no wind and the greens are perfect, and if you're hitting the ball solid on the fairways, you should be able to score.
