  Q. Some general comments on the morning matches, you have to be feeling good.  
 GREG NORMAN: It's not over yet. Phil has obviously gone out playing well, putting well. But Tim and Mike Weir are playing, we don't know how that's going to play out yet.   
 The guys have been in a good place all week and are showing that on the golf course. We just have to finish it off and see what the end result is after this morning.   
  
  Q. You kept Y.E. and Ryo together, obviously feeling good about the chemistry that they have together.   
 GREG NORMAN: Absolutely. Y.E. speaks a little bit of Japanese and so they get on very well. Their communication is very good, and they enjoy playing with each other, simple as that.
