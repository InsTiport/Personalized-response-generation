  Q. (Inaudible.)   
 GREG NORMAN: No, he thought he didn't know what the state of the match was. When you get into a zone like these guys get into, you sometimes lose whether you're under par or what your score is for the day. That's what happened to Retief, he thought the match was over and he didn't concede the putt, he just thought the match was over. It was a legitimate mistake -- (Inaudible.) It was just the intensity of the game.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)   
 GREG NORMAN: You just look at Justin, he played well, hit a beautiful second shot in there and did all the right things. You miss a short putt and it all comes down. And the game can be cruel. You look at some of my guys had a chance of going 2-up and they run into Phil and AK that birdie four holes in a row.   
 Just when you think you've got the game under control, this format -- (Inaudible.) It's difficult. It's tough being the captain watching, but I enjoyed it and I'm extremely proud of my guys today. We wanted to get out of the day with pretty close to a push and I'm very, very happy, the team balanced out well and really nobody played poorly that I noticed.   
 So tomorrow is fourball and let's go have at it.
