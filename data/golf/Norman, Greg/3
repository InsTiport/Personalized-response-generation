Q.   Thoughts on your round today? 
GREG NORMAN:   That was pretty ugly today.   Yeah, just wasn't pretty. 

Q.   What was the biggest issue? 
GREG NORMAN:   I think just being on the golf course was a big issue.   Concentration was bad and just wasn't really there with my golf swing.   Wasn't really there, period.   You know, reflect on a lot of the shots I played.
