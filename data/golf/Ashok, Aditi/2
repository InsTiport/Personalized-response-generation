Q. Aditi, shot 3-under round.  How does it feel to get a good start off to this tournament?
ADITI ASHOK: It feels good.  I liked the layout of the course when I played my practice round, so it's good to come out and shoot a good number here.
Q. What have you been working on in your game recently that you think has been paying off for you?
ADITI ASHOK: I think I've worked a lot on my drives.  I mean, I've always hit it pretty straight, but now I'm trying to hit it longer and straight.
So I think I hit almost every fairway today, so that's obviously my key.
And also, on my iron game, just getting it more tight.
Q. This is your second year on tour.  What do you think you learned from your first year, and how do you feel as a second-year player?
ADITI ASHOK: I think it gets better every year.  Some of these events have been in the same place for almost eight, ten years, maybe more.  I just feel like if you've played it once you kind of know the courses, how it suits your game.  You might know some pin placements.  It just helps you plan the week a lot better.
Also with the travel, I traveled a lot last year and I played almost -- at one point I played eight events in a row.
This year I think I've learn a lot about how much I can handle and where I would like to go play.
Q. You live and you learn.
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah.
