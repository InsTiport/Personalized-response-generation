 Q.  4-under par today.  How are you feeling?  
ADITI ASHOK: I'm feeling good.  I feel like I've left a couple shots between yesterday and today, but still 4-under going into the weekend is not bad, and I know if I'm consistent through the next two days, then I'll have a good chance.   
 Q.  How are the course conditions out there and how are you liking how your game matches up to the course?  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, the course, it's good.  It's kind of long on a couple holes for me.  But I think it's a really good golf course because it's kind of tight on a few holes, and even if you don't hit it that long -- I've been hitting it straight, and that's been rewarding me.   
So just trying to be in the fairway, be on the greens, and create enough birdie chances.  I've holed a few putts in the last two days, so that has helped, too.  I think it suits my game because of that.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be in a good spot heading into the weekend in a major championship?  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, I think it's been good.  The last two games were good and I knew my game was right where I wanted it to be.  I played well at the ANA, but I sort of didn't do well on the final day.  So I'm in a similar position now, so I just want to try and make up as much as I can.   
This is one of the biggest events, prize money-wise, and also the women's PGA.  So just to do well here would mean a lot to me.
