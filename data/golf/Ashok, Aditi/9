 Q.  Talk about being in contention going into Sunday.  What will that be like for you?  
ADITI ASHOK: It will be a good experience, obviously.  I've played well this season, but not as well as I would have wanted to, so to be in one of the last few groups on Sunday would be good, and I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  What will the pressure be like to be in contention and be in one of those final few groups?  
ADITI ASHOK: Well, this is my first time being in contention on the LPGA, but I'm assuming it's pretty much the same every tournament you're in contention.  I've won a couple times on the European Tour, so I'm going to hope that experience helps tomorrow.   
 Q.  What have you been doing this week that has allowed you for the first time to be in contention?  
ADITI ASHOK: I think I've hit -- the greens are smaller here, so I've just been focusing on hitting more greens because if you hit the green here you pretty much have a makeable birdie putt, so I've been focusing on that as opposed to attacking the pins, which I usually do sometimes, and I leave myself short-sided.  I've also been putting well, so that's what's worked.
