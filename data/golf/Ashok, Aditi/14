 Q.  Three consecutive rounds of 70.  That's pretty solid.  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, it was pretty solid.  I actually didn't start very well today.  I started, I was plus one in the first four holes but in the first four, all four were actually birdieable with the tailwind.  So I didn't really make use of that.  I made a par on No. 3, which is playing one shot under compared to the field.  That was not so good.   
But it was better after, the back nine, especially.  I shot 2-under on the back nine.   
 Q.  How are you feeling?  Are you happy or disappointed?  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, I'm happy.  I shot 2-under three days in a row.  I feel it was consistent but it could have been better.  But there's always something you can do better every week.  So it's fine.  I think I'm tied third right now, so I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  Were the conditions particularly tough today with the wind swirling?  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, it was more wind than we had the first two days.  It didn't change direction really but it was just more intense, so that was a little difficult.  Because it made some -- like the par 5 was really reachable, the third, but I didn't make use of that.  The tailwind didn't actually help me.  It wasn't so bad.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.   
 Q.  How will you reward yourself for a year like this?  
ADITI ASHOK: I'm just looking forward to going home.  Spending three, four weeks at home, practice.  I'm actually getting a new driver and 3-wood from the new 917, so I'm looking forward to practice with those.   
 Q.  Is that your idea of a Christmas gift?  
ADITI ASHOK: Kind of, yeah.   
 Q.  Did you exceed expectations this week?  You've obviously had so many things going on in the buildup.  
ADITI ASHOK: Yes and I also didn't really have a practice round, and that made it difficult.  But I think I did exceed expectations.  I made four birdies every day but a made a couple of mistakes every day, too.  To finish off your year with a top five is good.  It's not bad.
