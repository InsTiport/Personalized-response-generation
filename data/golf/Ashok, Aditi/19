Q. How are you enjoying the Olympic experience so far? 
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, it's been great, the experience of being in the village and now playing with the Olympics with the best in the world, it's surreal. I'm so happy to be here. 

Q. And what is it like, how special is it to have your dad sharing that experience as your caddie?
ADITI ASHOK: He's been caddying for me since a young age. So to have him here with me at the Olympics is obviously going to be a great experience for him, too. Also, having him on my bag will help me a lot this week. So yes, looking forward to it.

Q. And how does this rate in terms of your career on the scale of achievements so far? 
ADITI ASHOK: This would definitely be‑‑ playing in the Olympics was my goal since 2012 and to be here as an Indian, to have made it to the Olympics is a big achievement for me. Maybe on a scale, 1 to 10, probably 8. Ten would be like winning a medal. So that's what I'm going to work for. 

Q. And the golf course, what do you like about it? 
ADITI ASHOK: I like that it's sort of got a links feel. It's not really that many trees and stuff. So yeah, it's a bit like you're open in a way. So yeah, that's nice. And also the wind picks up and it can be a different golf course in two days. Yeah, it's going to be fun. 

Q. Feeling good about your chances? 
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, definitely. I mean, golf is a game where a good day for anybody is probably going to be the best in the field. So if I have four good days, then I'm sure I'll have a good chance.
