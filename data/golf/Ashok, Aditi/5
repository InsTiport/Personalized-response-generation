 Q.  You were bogey-free today, four birdies, but your caddie, and your father, tells me that you're a little bit frustrated?  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, I felt like I didn't put as good, even yesterday and today.  Today obviously, morning group, I didn't have that much wind.  So I had a lot of birdie putts, but I only managed to make four, so that's why I'm frustrated.   
 Q.  Just shows what high standards you've set yourself.  Of course, you do very well out here in the Middle East, don't you?  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, of course.  It reminds me a lot of home because the weather is similar, the food is similar, so yeah, I'm enjoying it.   
 Q.  We were just talking off-camera about the speed of the greens.  You feel they are a bit slower this year?  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, I feel they are a bit slower this year compared to last year.  When I played in 2014, it was really fast.  So compared to that, I think it's slow this year, but it's still in great condition.   
 Q.  So first couple of days, adjusting to the speed.  Last two days, rattling them home then?  
ADITI ASHOK: Yeah, of course.  Tomorrow is moving day, so I'm going to try to keep doing the same and hopefully the putts fall in.
