 Q.  How was your experience this week?  
ADITI ASHOK: It was good.  I played here last year and as an amateur, now we play as a pro, so it's good.   
 Q.  You had an interesting journey to get here coming from Stage 2 of Q-School in Florida out here to Malaysia.  I mean, what was that experience like?  
ADITI ASHOK: Well, I've never done that before.  It was the first time, and I got here only Tuesday night, so I didn't really get a practice round.  I just kind of had to go by what I played last year, but it was okay.  I did well for four days and I'm looking forward to playing Q-School.   
 Q.  You mentioned Q-School.  What's your schedule leading up to Q-School, and how do you feel playing against the LPGA's best and being paired even with Lydia Ko will prepare you for that?  
ADITI ASHOK: That was a great experience, the final two days, playing with the world No. 1.  Yeah, I'm going to play three events on the Ladies European Tour before playing Q-School, so hopefully that's going to give me some confidence before heading there.
