   HEE YOUNG PARK: Yeah, well, I played well. Actually this golf course every year, this is my third year, but every year like Top 10 or around there. So I just felt like just very calm and comfortable. Yesterday afternoon and today little bit disappointed with my putt.   
 But I just pretty good worked with my caddie, and I just enjoyed it and everything's fine. Even I didn't realize finish the 18 putt and then I didn't know the leaderboard or like the leader. So I was happy, yeah.  
  
  Q. Did you know that you were tied for the lead?   
 HEE YOUNG PARK: No, I didn't know that. Because Na Yeon and a few girls pretty good are already there. So I thought just forget about it and just play. I think that's a lot of help. I tried to keep avoiding the leaderboard. Like, oh, just keep playing, you know. Just like that and then everything's good.   
 Then 18 just happened, and my second shot I little bit I pulled it in the rough. But the lie was like a little bit difficult lie, so I couldn't do that any. But I was happy.  
  
  Q. I was going to say, so close, but still have to be pleased with the way you were able to and hopefully carry it on to next week too.   
 HEE YOUNG PARK: Yeah.
