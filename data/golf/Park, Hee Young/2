THE MODERATOR: Welcome Hee Young Park into the media center, one of the co-leaders heading into the third round tomorrow.   
Hee Young, right after your round we talked about you've been working on your trajectory shots.  Can you go into a bit of detail about the work you've been doing there?   
HEE YOUNG PARK: Yeah, after finish Evian I prepared during the Asia swing.  I expect a lot of rain, so I had practice - it's about just one week - but I had a lot of practice with the trajectory, different kind of shot from the range, which is a lot of help this week also.   
So that's why I hit it a lot close today even with the wind and the rain.   
 Q.  What impact did all that weather on the course have on your shots and your approach to every shot?  You talked about it being difficult because of the wet and the rain and wind.  What about it was difficult?  
HEE YOUNG PARK: So if weather is good some holes don't have to worry about miss the green or any -- some shots are easy to finish up.   
Today always difficult with wind and I have to every single shot really careful and more think about.  Makes more tired.  So hard to focusing end of the hole, so that's why I tried to - it is my opinion - not much smile and keep calm until finish.   
You know what?  I improved my putting, so I had confidence from putting.  I think that that came from the confidence.  Even released my whole shot.  That's why I think I hit it more aggressive and more had confidence.
