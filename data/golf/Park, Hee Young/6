 Q.   Great round again today; how are you feeling?  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   I feel great.   I was playing last week in Beijing, but I got cold and sick, flu, so a bit rough the last couple days, but now feels a lot better, and the weather is perfect.   It's been still not but not really extremely hot, which is perfect for me.   I played with Natalie today.   She played really good.   That's, I think, a little bit of motivation from that low round today, which is good.   Yeah, I think pretty much ready.  
   
 Q.   How did you beat the cold?   Lots of fluids or rest?  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   I drink a lot of water and like medicine, took a lot of medicine, and then didn't do much practice, a lot more stay like warm inside hotel room and relax.   I think a lot of drink water helped me.   
   
 Q.   Is that what you're going to do tonight then, too?  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Yes, of course.   Obviously here, this week, lots of good food around here like hot soup, noodles and things, so I'm going to eat warm stuff tonight and then get rest.  
   
 Q.   How was the course today?  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Pretty wet out there still.   I believe it rained a lot last week, so very wet.   Even on the greens, too, so I can hit a little more aggressive to pin like every hole, the green.  
   
 Q.   Did participating in the Chip For Charity help you today do you think?  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   I think so.   I hit it quite a bit good.   It's been like chipping, my distance wise, pretty good, and then I checked it, even the charity chipping contest, which just feels good.   
   
 Q.   Favorite thing about Malaysia; what do you like best about coming here?   
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Food.   
   
 Q.   What kind?   What's your favorite so far?  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Seafood, especially chili crab in Malaysia and Singapore, I think best in the world.
