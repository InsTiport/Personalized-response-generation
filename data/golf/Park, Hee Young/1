Q. How do you play 7 holes 4 under par in the very, very worst conditions?
HEE YOUNG PARK: I don't know.  It was pretty lucky today.  I didn't say it was ball skill, but before I come over to Asia swing I had a lot of practice with the trajectory shot making, which is the low shot, high shot.
I think that was working this week.
Q. It's been a couple years since you last had a win.  Must be very full of confidence going into the weekend with this great play.
HEE YOUNG PARK: Yeah, especially my putting.  I been a little bit issue my putting, like just 2% off, so very hard to figure out my putting.
But this week my (indiscernible) is great, like 25, 27, even low, so I am really confidence with the short putting.  I think I can hit it more aggressive.
Q. At times we thought we need to make you a bit happier.  You're leading the golf tournament and you looked a little bit frustrated and sad out there.  It was a very good round of golf.
HEE YOUNG PARK: Yeah, I order myself try to not too much going up or down, so I was keep figure out one shot of the time.
So this is not the leading birdie shot or birdie putt about the leading for the week, so that's why I try to a little bit more judgment.
