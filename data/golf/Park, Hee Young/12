  MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Hee Young Park into the interview room.   Congratulations on a great round, 7‑under par, tremendous way to start this tournament.   
Just take me through your day and what was really working well for you.  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   I mean, before the Evian Masters I did a lot of work.   I did a lot of work like kayak, bike, little bit ever run, tennis.   I really enjoy it and then everything fresh my body.  
And then also this week really fresh air, and actually my group was really nice.   We were really enjoyed it.   Today like perfect weather.   Not really cold.   A little bit of warm, but not really.   
THE MODERATOR:   Taking that break, did you feel like you needed it?   Was there something that made you say, I'm going to take a little bit of a step back maybe?   
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Yeah, it was pretty pressure of the major.   After play US Open and then kind of frustrate, and then just needed something to forget about.   Most like good things like mom's cook or like family.   
But is far away from my family, so I got to do something.   I found some good lake or like something to do, and that was so fantastic for me.   So I got to do more than before.   Yeah, a little bit more.   
THE MODERATOR:   In the round today what was it that really got you going?   Was it the putting?   What kicked in to be able to shoot so low today?   
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Yeah, actually, I been play 15 years I never use the belly putter.   Then like 10 days ago, I just change the belly putter.  
Then I was kind of like really nervous about the change in my putter, and then first, second hole was really nervous, but I'm just forget about it.   Do like same practice round or whatever.   
THE MODERATOR:   So the belly putter is that new, huh?   
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Yeah, really, really new.   And then my around people are saying, Really?   Are you going to use that?   Yeah.   Did you know that Ernie Els won last week with the belly putter?   Did you see that?   
Then I got more confidence.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   That was nearby Albany.   I live in Orlando Florida, but that was like around New York.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Massachusetts.   
THE MODERATOR:   Massachusetts, too.   So toured a little bit up in the east coast in the U.S.  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Yeah.  
THE MODERATOR:   What made you decide to go up there?   
HEE YOUNG PARK:   I just tour.   Let's see, after U.S.   Open it Chicago, right, very close to Chicago?   So hang out in Chicago for like half day, and then actually I planned like four months ago.   It was fantastic.   I saw Internet and everything like quiet.   
THE MODERATOR:   And with the belly putter, how long did it take for you?   Did you have a feel for it right away?   
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Um, yeah, I learned it before like few times like in 10 minutes every time.   But, you know, kind of pretty different feel.   But it works really well, even in 10 minutes after practice.  
But my caddie was really old‑style, old school, so he say, When you done with the 15 years with the normal putter, then this is the test.   I want to try last even 10 minutes I done really well, and then feels kind of little bit different but working really well I think, so I really want to use before I get older.   
So I think good to change.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Actually, it has been five years in LPGA, and then I used to play KLPGA, Korean Tour.   
MODERATOR:   Last year at the end of the year you won your first LPGA event.  
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Yes.   
MODERATOR:   How much has that helped you in terms of confidence?   
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Yeah, I mean, everything is not really important.   Just another game to me about the confidence.   Even without golf in my life, getting more change, more positive thing, and everything change good for me.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much.   
HEE YOUNG PARK:   Thank you.
