Q. Can you walk me through the last shot, and what are the emotions you're feeling?
HEE YOUNG PARK: Actually we were on timing with the rolling, so we kind of a little bit behind the group, from front of the group, so we kind of a little bit of play faster than like normal speed, patient, and then especially Kat, she played today really good, so we just keep it up, speed up, and just keep it simple mind, and then I think that also great picked up.
Q. Just in terms of on that last approach shot, did you see it go in, or was it the crowd that --
HEE YOUNG PARK: As soon as I hit it, it was really solid, and then luckily I saw it. I saw it bounce, the front of the pin, and then hit the pin. I hear the noise. So as soon as it hit the pin, like maybe it's going in, and everybody just crazy, so I kind of same way. I knew it with the crowd, and hear the pin noise. It was a great feeling.
Q. Talk about finishing off this round -- no better way than to finish off like that. Looking here to tomorrow, your thoughts?
HEE YOUNG PARK: You know what, no matter what, finish strong, birdie or eagle for last, that's a good sign for start of final round or any next day, so I think it's going to be a good sign. The behind groups are still playing, but this course is in perfect shape out there, so if I can shoot like 8-, 9-under tomorrow, who knows.
