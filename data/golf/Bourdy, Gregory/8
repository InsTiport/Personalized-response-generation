 Q.  Tell us what the issue was today.  Just tell us how you felt the day went with as long as it was.  
GREGORY BOURDY: Actually, this morning was great almost all around.  I played great golf.  I finished with a double bogey on 18.   
But this afternoon it was tougher.  I didn't play so well, five bogeys.  It was a tough afternoon.  So I'd like to have a good sleep and play much better tomorrow morning.   
 Q.  We always talk about the U.S. Open, how tough it is to remain patient?  
GREGORY BOURDY: It is.   
 Q.  When that happens, like today, how tough is it for you to mentally stay in it?  
GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, it's very tough, but we know U.S. Opens, it's a big test, one of the biggest in the world, and we know the course is already difficult.  We have to stay patient, calm, stay in the present, stay focused on our game, and hope to play better the rest of the round.
