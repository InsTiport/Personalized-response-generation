GREGORY BOURDY: It was a very good start.  I started with three birdies state on the front nine and unfortunately I missed some drives on the back nine and then a few on the front nine, as well.  My driving was not good enough today.  Still a good round.  Still a very good week.  I expected for sure better today.   
 Q.  Important for Race to Dubai.  
GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, it was important for me to finish very well this tournament.  I knew my game was there.  I've had a solid game the last few weeks but the results were not so good.  So I stayed focused and I stayed patient, and I had a very good week.
