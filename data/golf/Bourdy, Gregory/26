  GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, it means a lot, for me, it's one of my favourite tournaments of the year.   I love this course and the atmosphere, also.   It's always nice to come here and play, and I hope to play like three years ago when I finished sixth, because the last two years, it was not good for me. 
So I had some good memories three years ago, and yeah, I'll try to do the same actually.

Q.   Clearly you have the experience of playing well here, but how much more intensity, pressure, do you put on yourself when you play this event? 
GREGORY BOURDY:   Actually it's difficult to find the right way, because I like to do a big performance.   I like to play great here in France in front of the friends, family and the French crowd. 
But, we have to also stay a little bit calm and maybe don't try too much, so that's the key.   I did that three years ago.   So, yeah, I feel confident this year.   I feel very good in my golf.   So yeah, I had the week off last week, so I'm ready for this week, to fight till Sunday afternoon. 

Q.   And your game is good on what is a challenging, very attractive course?
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yes, because it's a difficult course, yeah, one of the most difficult of the year I think.   Especially the weather, it's not good, but yeah, we saw the last few years, even with good weather, a Topâ€‘10, it's maybe less than minus ten or something like this, if you finish under par, you're not so far. 
But yeah, it's a competitive course, but great design and when I speak with a lot of players on Tour, yes, they all say it's one of the best of the year, and the conditions are great every year. 
So yeah, it's really enjoyable to play that course, Le Golf National, and I try to play it a few more years, especially in 2018.
