 Q.   Four matches, four wins, what makes this team unbeatable?   
JOOST LUITEN:   I think the consistency.   We played really consistent.   Didn't make really a lot of mistakes, a lot of pars.   Especially in foursomes, that's pretty good and we made some birdies out there, as well.   I think we worked really well as a team together.  
   
 Q.   How special for you to be doing this in front of your home fans?   
GREGORY BOURDY:   Well it means a lot for sure.   I was so pleased to be on that team and I tried actually my best to get as many points as I could.   We did a great job the last three days with Joost, so, yeah, I'm very happy about that.   I'm very proud to do that in front of the French crowd.  
   
 Q.   Does this increase your desire to play Ryder Cup having experienced this?   
JOOST LUITEN:   Oh, of course.   Playing match play and a team like this, this is a different game than we play normally and I love it.   It's great and it's a great experience and you try to learn as much as you can for The Ryder Cup next year.  
   
 Q.   No player has ever won five out of five in a Seve Trophy and you both have that chance tomorrow; how special would that be for you?   
GREGORY BOURDY:   We will try our best, we will see tomorrow.   We are very confident and we played very well today, especially on the end in this round.   We will do our best and try to get another point for sure.
