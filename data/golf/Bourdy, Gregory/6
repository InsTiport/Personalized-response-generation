Q. Were you surprised at the buzzing around you?
GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, a bit surprised.  A bit surprised.  I hit the shot and instead hit the bees.
Q. Scary?
GREGORY BOURDY: Not very scared but a little bit.  You never know, because I didn't want to check behind.
Q. I take it such a thing has never happened to you on a golf course before?  We know it has with Pablo LarrazÃ¡bal with worse circumstances.
GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah actually, I remember that.
Q. And you got through it, unscathed, 2-under par, how good is that to start?
GREGORY BOURDY: I think it's a very good start on this course.  It was a bit cold at the beginning but I played great golf.  My irons were very good and hit a few good putts.
Q. It's always special playing here at home, isn't it, and more so the 100th edition of the Open de France?
GREGORY BOURDY: You can see the crowd behind us on the first tee, they are quite noisy.  Maybe because, yeah, we are a lot of top players here.  It's nice to see.
