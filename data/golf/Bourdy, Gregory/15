  NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   You birdied the first hole to go 1‑up to go 1‑up and that's pretty much the way it.  
   
 Q.   You birdied the first hole to go 1‑up and that's pretty much the way it stayed all day.   How did you feel at the end of that?   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It was a pretty tight game towards the end.   I made a very good birdie from‑‑ Seve‑style from the forest down the left to keep myself up in the game.   Had a putt to win on 17, though, but yeah, it was a very even match, you know.   It was quite exciting.   
   
 Q.   It got a little bit iffy around 11, 12 area?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well I could have been 3‑up after eight.   I missed a chance there, lost the hole after and was only 1‑up where I thought I could easily be 3‑up.   That kept Paul very close.   But I think we both played pretty well down the stretch.   
   
 Q.   Much of the great names in European golf have played in the Seve Trophy, and no one has ever won five out of five points before.   Try to sum up the sense of achievement.   
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, I'm so happy to achieve that, and it was an amazing week for me.   I hope Europe Continental is going to win because I did my job and proud to get five points for this amazing captain, Chema OlazÃ¡bal, he's a great champion.   I'm happy to get five points for him and for the team.   I hope it's going to be enough to win.   
   
 Q.   You've won tournaments on The European Tour, but this is different, part of the team environment, to achieve this in front of your home fans, as well.   
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, in France, it was great to play here in front of my French crowd and in Saint‑Nom‑la‑BretÃ¨che, it's a great course, and I love to play in team events.   I love, also, match play, so I enjoy this week a lot, especially my doubles with Joost, and then today again a great round.   
So, yeah, very good, I'm very happy about that.
