  Q. A slow issue start to your round but 4-under par for the last 11 holes, what was the secret to that success?   
 GREGORY BOURDY: I don't know. All my game was much better than at the beginning and maybe almost like yesterday. I didn't start well yesterday also. It was maybe a blustery, as today, after seven holes, I think. Yeah, it was tough, but yeah, I had to be patient and I did it and then after my putting was very good again. So I made maybe four birdies, yeah, in that conditions, really happy about that.   
  
  Q. What's the most difficult aspect of the game in these conditions?   
 GREGORY BOURDY: By the putting, it's very difficult, because yeah, the wind is blowing quite hard sometimes, so yeah, you need -- it's difficult.   
 You need to be consistent on your game, on your putting, so maybe the most difficult part of the game, maybe the putting.   
  
  Q. You won last year, you won the year before, fancy making it three in a row tomorrow?  
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yes, we try, for sure I do my best and yeah, we'll see tomorrow evening.
