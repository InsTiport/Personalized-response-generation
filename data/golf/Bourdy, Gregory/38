   GREGORY BOURDY: I started quite bad, the front nine was difficult. I made a lot of mistakes. I missed two small putts. So I was plus three after maybe seven holes, so it was difficult. My putting was much better at the end, so for sure, the course is easier like this.   
 Yeah, I made five birdies on the back nine, so yeah, it's great to come back like this.   
  
  Q. It's quite a transition to come back from 3-over par to your position. Is it purely the putting that made the difference?  
 GREGORY BOURDY: Not only the putting. I missed a wedge on the second hole. It was a very bad wedge, so I made bogey. So you know, it was not only the putting. Yeah, I missed a few irons but then it was much better. I tried to keep this game for the weekend.   
  
  Q. Is there a change of attitude involved, as well, because sadly you could have been thinking, oh, I've got the weekend off here and just change your approach entirely.   
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, for sure, but when I was plus one total, I didn't know about the cut. So no, I had to be patient and to play my game, to play shot after shot, and to see at the end of the day.   
  
  Q. Haven't seen you for a little while, so what's been happening in recent months?   
 GREGORY BOURDY: Just I was on holidays during three weeks, so, yeah, it was good. I drank some good wine. It was beautiful. I just practised maybe three or four times, and then yeah, when I practised just before to come here, I played very well. So yeah, I feel good. Maybe holidays help me to play like this.   
  
  Q. Sounds like it was beneficial just to recharge the batteries.   
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yes, yes, for sure. We need to do that.
