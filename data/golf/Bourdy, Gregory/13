  GREGORY BOURDY:   Happy and proud to get a score like this on a very good course and difficult golf course like this. 
The wind, maybe it was stronger yesterday and the day before, but it was still there and yeah, it was still a long course with so many long irons between five, four, 3â€‘irons, but I feel very confident with my long game and my putting was also much better today. 
So that's why I had a great score like this.

Q.   Confident and excited because you're in a nice position now?
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yes, of course I'm in a nice position.   We'll see how far from the lead I'm going to be.   I'm going to keep playing my own game and I still have a chance to win here so I'll do my best.

Q.   What was it like playing with Rory?   It's always a carnival around here and there's so many watching today. 
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, I actually thought it was nice to play with a champion like Rory.   Yeah, the Chinese crowd was behind him all around.   It was okay, we had a great game with Pablo, also, and I think except on the 18th maybe for him but we had a good game, all three, and I hope the best for Pablo and Rory tomorrow.
