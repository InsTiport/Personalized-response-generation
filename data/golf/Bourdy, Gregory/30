  GREGORY BOURDY:   It was, again, a very good round.   I made just one bogey today, so it was not a very good start.   I was plus one after three holes, but then I played consistent, made a few birdies. 
I missed a few shots at the end, but my putting was very good, so it was nice to see, and yeah, it was great to have this feeling on these greens. 
So yeah, hopefully it is going to stay like this for the weekend.

Q.   Any particular highlight today?   Anything that said, yeah, this is going to be a good day?
GREGORY BOURDY:   No, I think it was a great day as yesterday.   I enjoyed it a lot.   It was, again, perfect course, perfect weather, and so yeah, perfect day to be happy, and I finished with 5â€‘under today, 11 under overall, and not far from the lead, so yeah, it's great.   Good position.

Q.   How does the afternoon compare to the morning in terms of just playing out there?
GREGORY BOURDY:   Except you are tired in the morning, except you wake up very early the first day, no, there was not a very big difference because the wind was the same.   So maybe the pin positions today were a bit more difficult.   So it was not really ease to get some birdies, but I made six today again, so I'm very happy about that.

Q.   It sounds like you're going to relish a bit more time in bed anyway because you're one of the later starters over the weekend. 
GREGORY BOURDY:   That's right.   It's better to sleep on the weekend.   That means you play very well.   Yeah, but it's always nice to play in the morning also because the greens are perfect, so when you wake up after, it's a great day.   Yeah, I said that just for fun, but yeah, it was almost the same day yesterday morning and this afternoon.
