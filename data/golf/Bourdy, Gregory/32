 Q. Leader in the clubhouse. 
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, actually, minus four today, it's a very good round in that condition, because the stuff was not very easy. But I did a very good round, I didn't make any bogeys. So yeah, I enjoyed my game and I tried to get more birdies at the end, but at least I tried on the 18th, eagle, and missed it. But it's still very good. Alex is minus nine with three holes to play; so I will wait. 
 I made two good pars on 16, 17, difficult ones. It was just on 17, my tee shot on the par 3, maybe one metre on the right, it was just next to the pin. But that's golf. But I made a very good bunker shot, and two good putts, or three good putts I think on 16, 17 and 18, also for the birdie. So that's good to finish like this.

 Q. You must be delighted with the way you're playing, especially this time of year, it's an important time of the season?
 GREGORY BOURDY: Of course, it's nice to feel good now, the French Open is coming, it's one of my favourite tournaments in the U.S., so it's good. We'll see at the French. But also, I like Le Golf National. I like a lot this course, also. I think I'm going to come every year. 

 Q. What are you going to do now, go down to the range and keep warm? 
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, of course. I will see what Alex is doing. He's on the 16th, so, yeah, I'm going to wait to see and keep warm and we will see.
