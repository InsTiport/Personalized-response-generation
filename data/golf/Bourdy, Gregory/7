 Q.  Your thoughts on Le Golf National?  
GREGORY BOURDY: It's a very difficult course.  You have to play for sure with confidence, but not to play too aggressive.   
It's a difficult course with difficult tee shots, and the most important thing is to find the fairway, play a solid game.  And sometimes, even if you are far from the pin, on the greens, too, it's always good, always okay.  Yeah, up-and-down a few times this year.  I've played a few times quite good here but I'd like to play even better this year.   
 Q.  You've said there are changes to the course.  Are they changes you favour?  How have they made a difference to things?  
GREGORY BOURDY: I think, yeah, they made a few things on the greens.  Not big ones, like I think some of them needed these changes.  Yeah, I think that would be more the pin positions, like on 16.  I'm thinking like on 1, on the first, as well.   
And the tee shots on the third, fourth, fifth, much better now.  Not easier but I think much better for us and for the public, as well.  So for the public, for The French Open, and for The Ryder Cup, as well.
