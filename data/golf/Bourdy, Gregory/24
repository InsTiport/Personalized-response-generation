  GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, actually it was a lot easier this morning than yesterday afternoon.   I don't know, because maybe of the wind, the pin positions, also, are not so easy but I played okay.   I managed just a few mistakes unfortunately but that's golf.   Good for the confidence for the rest of the week. 

Q.   Battling the winds on the first day, you thought it might be a bit simpler today. 
GREGORY BOURDY:   I thought it's going to be much easier this morning, but it wasn't, actually.   So plus one this morning, I expected better than this but I still think it's a good score. 

Q.   I don't know if you have any thoughts on what the leaders might achieve this afternoon. 
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, we'll see the weather this afternoon.   I don't know what is the forecast, but I've heard that it's going to be maybe rainy, maybe stronger winds, so we'll see.   I did my job, and actually I won't do anything this afternoon.   I'm just going to practise for tomorrow to be ready.
