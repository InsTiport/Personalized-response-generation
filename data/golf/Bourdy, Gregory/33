  Second Round 66. 8-Under Total. 132  
   
  Q. How good was it today?   
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, good, good. A good score again today, minus four today and minus eight total. I'm still okay. It was a strange day. I missed a few putts. I made a few bad putts, but I made many good ones, also. It was -- I finished well with three birdies in the last four. So, yeah, good finish, and I'm still confident for this weekend.  
  
  Q. Talk us through some of those good ones then. What were the highlights?   
 GREGORY BOURDY: Actually the 7-iron on 6 and my putt -- my putt on the 8th.   
  
  Q. Nice long one?   
 GREGORY BOURDY: Well, I think maybe six, seven metres. Yeah, it was good to do that.   
  
  Q. Wouldn't be at all bad if you keep up this scoring, would it?  
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, yeah, I feel very good here. I like the course. It's the same. I'm looking for something great this weekend.   
  
  Q. Is the course the same this year? Clearly we are playing on preferred lies for the first two days. That little bit dusty?  
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, I don't know why, the fairways are okay. They are good. Maybe the greens are a bit quicker, so, yeah, the course is getting better and better I think every year. That's a good thing. The tournament is still a good tournament, so I'd love to win again.   
  
  Q. How well have you defended your titles before?   
 GREGORY BOURDY: It was in Portugal last year, and well, I finished Top-10. I hope I'm going to finish better than that this weekend.
