Q. Thoughts on a 68 to start?
GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, it's a good start.  Good start.  It was cold this morning, freezing.  Not easy to make some nice shots.  But yeah, I played good.  I missed a few shots but I knew my game and my putting, especially my putting is good this week.  I feel very good on the greens and I really like the design of the course, very beautiful.  Yeah, I enjoyed my game.  It's a good start.
Q. Is this a course you would have played before?
GREGORY BOURDY: I played it.  Probably 11 years ago for a World Golf Championships event, American Express Championship.  I played there.  So not some great memories but I have some good memories, because it was a great tournament.  Tiger Woods won this one.  Anyway, I enjoyed the week.
This week, it's totally different.  Yeah, I come here with another game, more confidence, and yeah, I will try to do my best the rest of the week.
Q. More confidence?  You are feeling good right at the moment?
GREGORY BOURDY: Yeah, I played good this summer.  I had a few good rounds last week and September, as well.  Yeah, I feel actually my game is solid and my putting, much better now.  Much more consistent.  Yeah, I feel confident.  I feel in good shape.
Q. Is that down to hard work or the rhythms of golf, or have you changed something particularly with your putting?
GREGORY BOURDY: No, I just keep working on it.  And maybe, I don't know, maybe because I got married.
Q. Has it changed you?
GREGORY BOURDY: No, I don't think so.  But you know, I feel happy and good.
