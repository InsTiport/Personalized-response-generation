  GRÃGORY BOURDY:   I enjoyed a lot, because yeah, I didn't start well this season over the last two weeks.   I missed two cuts, but yeah, I played good, but you never know in golf, and actually at the beginning of this week I had some good feeling and yeah, I love this course also.   I love the design of this course.   It's in very good shape this year.
So yeah, I feel comfortable, and I enjoy every moment here, and I try to play like today the rest of the week.

Q.   And is there something that worked today that hasn't been working or quite clicking in recent weeks?
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   I don't know.   Yeah, sure.   My game was much better.   Maybe my driving was better than the last two weeks, because I missed two tee shots, and it was, yeah, difficult after a big rough to have some good opportunities for birdies.   So that's why what I did was tough for me.
And this week, yeah, I feel good with the driver, and so it's much more easier when your tee shots are on the fairway or just on the small rough.   So yeah, this part of the game was much better, and I feel okay also with my putter.   So on these beautiful greens, yeah, it's great.

Q.   Yeah, they're like carpets, aren't they, out there, fast‑running carpets?
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah.   They're amazing.   The course is one of the best of the year, and again, this year it's really wonderful.   So yeah, it's very nice to play here in this tournament.

Q.   I presume you're as positive as all of us, right, at the start of the year.   You think, yeah, really get going, fast out of the blocks, and so it's a little frustrating if things don't work in the first two events?
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, sure.   It's very frustrating, because you stop for a few weeks and then when you restart you really want to play well, and when ‑‑ yeah, when it's tough like this, yeah, it's really, really frustrating.   And that was the case the two weeks, but I think, yeah, I have to be patient, and I play okay, I played very good today.   I didn't make any bogeys, so that's why in golf, you have to keep going, to keep practicing and then you don't know after that, but yeah, you have to stay patient.
