   GRÃGORY BOURDY: The course, it's more difficult than last year. The rough is very tough and it's longer. 

 Q. The opening day was obviously a good round, was there anything that was better and improved on day would? 
 GRÃGORY BOURDY: Yes, my driving was much better, and the irons were not quite the same as yesterday. I didn't make a lot of birdies during the front nine but then I made some and it's very good.

 Q. Bearing in mind the greens are very soft, does it make a difference playing in the morning compared to the afternoon? 
 GRÃGORY BOURDY: Yeah, it's a little bit different but not a lot. I think not a big difference than yesterday afternoon. 
 So the greens, of course, are better in the morning, and quicker, but it's quite similar. 

 Q. What is it about this part of the world having won in Portugal? 
 GRÃGORY BOURDY: This part of the world, the weather is fantastic, and the food here, the food is very good. I ate some fresh fish every evening, so it's good, and I like this and this course, it's wonderful. 
 Yeah, I'm enjoying it. 

 Q. So the secret to having a good round in Portugal is eat fresh fish? 
 GRÃGORY BOURDY: I think so. (Laughing).

 Q. Did you find yourself thinking back to Estoril and what happened there when you took the flight into Portugal once more? 
 GRÃGORY BOURDY: Of course, I'm very happy to be there but I didn't hit the ball very good at the start of the week and we changed something and now it's better. So I think that's why also I'm playing good this week.
