Q.   How does it feel to come out on top in such a dramatic afternoon, the lead changing every five seconds? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, it was an amazing round.   I started great with an eagle, led me to get a lot of confidence for the rest of the course.
Unfortunately I made two bogeys on 13, 14, so it is part of the round, because I needed some birdie to finish‑‑ actually I made an amazing finish with three birdies in a row, 16, 17, 18.   I'm so happy about this, and I'm going to remember a long time about this finish in this great course, a lot of great moments have been here for The Ryder Cup and I was thinking about it on the 18th when I was walking on this fairway. 
So I'm so proud to win this trophy at Celtic Manor.

Q.   Describe the adrenaline rush on 16, that was really the turning point that put you back in the position?
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, after my two bogeys on 13, 14, I missed the birdie on 15, which is not an easy hole, but a good opportunity to get birdies.   I didn't get it, and yeah, on 16, it was of course the key to finish great, because my putt on 16, maybe the most difficult putt of today.   So that helped me a lot to finish great the last two holes.

Q.   Incredible putting the last three holes; you changed your grip this week, left below right back to right below left; good decision? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yes, actually, it's amazing, because I changed on Monday and decided last week to change, because I thought it was not good enough, and I came back to my old grip with my old putter, we can see that, and I kiss it because I started great, the round, with it, this tournament. 
I didn't hole a lot of birdies today except at the end, I was thinking, I know, I know my putter is so hot this week, it's going to help me at the end and I stayed patient. 
It helped me the last three putts that I needed, yeah, thanks God to Cameron and thanks to Titleist for this. 

Q.   What does this win do for you going forward? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   I don't know, actually, I want to stay in the present now, and I'm enjoying so much this victory and what I did this weekend.   Yeah, I appreciate it so much.

Q.   Ryder Cup points start this week, you're at the top of the list; how exciting are the possibilities? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, I just heard it was starting this week after my first round, and I didn't realise it was this week, and actually to win here to be at the top of this list, it's a dream and a goal to be in The Ryder Cup team quick, and especially in France in 2018. 
So if I can get in before France, it's going to be great.   It's one of my first goals in golf to be in The Ryder Cup, so I'll do my best to stay in that team. 
It's a great tournament here, it's for me one of the best tournaments of the year.   I always played good here.   I thought I had a chance to win here on that course, and actually, it happened today.   It was an amazing week, and a great course.   I'm so proud to win in Celtic Manor in Wales where it was The Ryder Cup three years ago, and Europe won. 
So when I was walking on the 18th, I was thinking, yeah, it would be so great to win that tournament.   I holed the last putt.   Yeah, it's amazing.   I can't say it's my best victory on Tour, they are all great, but this one is for sure not the worst.

Q.   You've come close here before, this week you've been solid all through the week, but talk me through the last three, because that's a wonderful way to finish it?
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, because actually I started the round with an eagle on the second when I holed the bunker shot, so that helped me, yeah, to get confidence for the rest of the round.   I've played solid, solid game, solid long game and solid putting, also. 
Actually my two bogeys on 13, 14, it was difficult this time, because I was leading‑‑ I knew the finish was very, very tough here on 16, 17, 18.   So to finish with three birdies here on this course, with this finish, I'm so, so happy about this to finish strong like this.
