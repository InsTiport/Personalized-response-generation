  NEIL AHERN:   Many congratulations on a really great victory, your emotions first of all through the three holes and after the win.
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, the three holes, amazing, actually.   Because actually my putting this week, I changed my putter at the beginning of this week to get back to my old putter and with my old grip, also, so standard grip and beautiful Scotty Cameron, but my old one. 
I started great the week.   I holed many putts.   I didn't hole a lot of putts today before the 16th.   I was putting great but I didn't hole as much as I could.   I stayed patient and I thought my putting, maybe it's going to help me at the end to win this trophy, and it happened like this. 
Yeah, it's amazing, because maybe I state of mind calm and because of my attitude, I finish maybe like this, so I'm so, so happy and proud to win this trophy after this finish on this great course with a lot of things which happened here in The Ryder Cup.
NEIL AHERN:   It was a roller coaster, 14 you drove into the water and didn't look very good at that point.   What was going through your head? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, actually after my bogey on 13, it's a very difficult hole, and so the bogey was okay.   I had 3‑putts that I was far from the hole, and so the bogey on this hole was not so terrible but unfortunately, I think we made a mistake to hit drive from the tee. 
Yeah, I think it was not a huge mistake, but it was quite a big mistake.   I feel after the bogey, it's never the same.   You lose a little bit of confidence, and because before this, I was playing great and I was very confident; after these two bogeys, it was different. 
I made a birdie on 15, which was also with a good chance at birdie.   After 15, I just told me, yeah, you are still leading with Peter and another guy, SÃ¸ren was minus five, so I still have a chance to win.   Play great the last few holes, you know, it's a tough, tough finish, one of the toughest on Tour I think we play.   And finish, birdie 16, 17, and it's quite tough on 18, it means a lot. 
I've won three tournaments on Tour, but I've never finished like this.   So, yeah, I'm very happy about this. 
NEIL AHERN:   There's a big Ryder Cup element to this venue and the whole event this week, and you're atop The Ryder Cup points list now.   How does that feel? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   I don't feel it right now actually because it's, well, my life goal and dream to be in The Ryder Cup team.   I played golf since I was three years old, and it's always been my dream to win a major and winning in The Ryder Cup, and I have a chance now to be maybe in the next one.   But there are a lot of tournaments to play.   It's not going to be tight right now but it's a great start for sure, so I take it.   But I will need to play again very well, because I know there are so many great players in Europe and it's going to be tough, as usual, to be in the team. 
So I take it like this, and I will do my best to stay in the team. 

Q.   Would being in The Ryder Cup, playing in The Ryder Cup, would that be the greatest achievement of your career? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yes, of course.   As I said, it's one of my dream‑‑ I played golf, yeah, since for many years now, and‑‑ winning tournaments on Tour, because you have a lot of good feelings with it.   But playing The Ryder Cup, it's different, also, and when we see all of the guys who played on The Ryder Cup and say it's a different tournament, even winning Majors, it's a different feeling, so when you play in the team and when you especially win, it looks amazing. 
So I want so much to be in The Ryder Cup, for sure, one day, especially in France in 2018.   It's now for the next few years one of my big goals and if I can be in the team before‑‑ and of course, in France, it would be fantastic.   But it's not the end of the world if I'm not in the team, but I will do my best, for sure, to be on the next one. 
I hope, also, I am in America but already four in France.

Q.   I see you didn't realise The Ryder Cup points were available here until after you played the first round. 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Actually, I knew it was at this period of the year but usually it's the week of Switzerland.   So that's why I was thinking it was next week. 
Yeah, somebody told me after my first round, oh, it's a good start for The Ryder Cup points; yeah, okay.   But after I did three great days after this‑‑ like to say hello to Paul, I hope he watched (laughing). 

Q.   We were trying to work out from here the distances of some of those putts that you holed on the last three holes.   Can you give us what you thought the distances were and also maybe the clubs that you hit into those holes for the three birdies, please? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   16, I had a 4‑iron second shot and then I think the putt was from ten metres maybe.   It was actually okay, so two putts were good. 
But at this moment of the tournament, you know you need birdies and so I was thinking just try to hole this putt, try to hole this putt, and yeah, even the 18th, also, was not easy at all, but this one was more difficult. 
So I holed this one, it helped me a lot to get a lot of confidence for 17, because 17, I hit a very good shot and the putt was shorter, it was birdie opportunity.   It was maybe four metres, so 12 feet. 

Q.   What did you hit? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   5‑iron.   On the last, actually, after my wedge, it was a 52‑degree, I played it a bit short.   The short, even with the sand wedge, was not‑‑ maybe it felt more the same distance, maybe a bit shorter on 16, but I would say a little less than 30 feet maybe.   But it was long.   It was long (laughing). 

Q.   It's been four years I think since the last of the wins in Hong Kong; is that right? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   2009. 

Q.   Any reason why you think it's been a long gap? 
GRÃGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, especially last year, I played great a few tournaments but I didn't get all the four rounds in a row.   In golf, yeah, sometimes if you are very close, you don't know your not winning, you don't win. 
But I stayed patient, and maybe that's why I won this tournament.   I stayed confident even two years ago when I missed a lot of cuts.   I thought my game, my long game, was improving a lot, and the last few months, I thought, yeah, I thought I had a big chance to win again because I felt and I'm feeling great with my long game, much better than a few years ago, and I knew if I get better putting, that it could happen again, and that happened this week. 
Maybe I remember when I won my three tournaments on Tour, I was first or second in the stats of the putting.   I think this week, I didn't check, but I'm not far; if I'm not leading, I think I'm not far.   That, for sure, is the key, is the putting, and the last few years, my putting was a bit average.   Some very good rounds but some poor, poor ones, so this week, it was very consistent. 
NEIL AHERN:   Thank you.
