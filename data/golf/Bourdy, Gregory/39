  Q. Poor conditions out there but you must be delighted to shoot a 67.   
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yes, for sure, 67 in that conditions is quite good on this course. It's quite a tough course, really wet, and yeah, I played just quite consistent, very well, and so yeah, I'm happy about that.  
  
  Q. The course seems to have taken the water reasonably well. There was standing water for a while but how is it playing now that you've finished your round?  
 GREGORY BOURDY: It's all right. It's all right because it's been raining since Monday. The course is quite good, quite good, and the greens are almost perfect, quite quick. I think, yeah, it's a good thing. It's a good thing.  
 I hope the forecast will not be too bad for the rest of the week.   
  
  Q. You tied for 10th recently in Wales, so a good score in your second round, looking for a successful weekend here?  
 GREGORY BOURDY: Yes, I will try to play my best for the rest of the week and yeah, I feel good. I feel much better than at the beginning of the season, so yeah, I will try to win for sure this tournament.
