  GREGORY BOURDY:   It's hard, and today was even more difficult.   I was very happy to score under par, very good score.   Very surprised about the leader, minus seven here, maybe normal‑‑ it's like minus 12 or 13.  
   
 Q.   Did the wind pick up, as well, during the round?   
GREGORY BOURDY:   Actually it started blowing maybe after a few holes, maybe after the fourth, and then it was almost the same through all the round.   
Yeah, strong wind and long course, very long course.   But in great condition, so I enjoyed a lot, yeah.   
   
 Q.   What a way to start The Final Series, you have four terrific events back‑to‑back.   
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yes, four great tournaments and even the fifth with the World Cup I'm going with Victor.   So, yeah, five great tournaments, so I'm very excited about it.   I started well The Final Series, so I'm happy.
