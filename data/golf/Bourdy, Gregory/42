   GRÉGORY BOURDY:  The morning was terrific.  The weather was there and the course, as well, was pretty good.  I also was very consistent, minus-two on the front nine, and so not a lot of birdies.  I didn't putt very well during the front nine but then it was much better and I made five birdies on the back. 
 Yeah, minus-seven, really happy, and I had a good partner, as well, today with Martin Kaymer.  He made 11-under, so it was a good day. 

 Q.  I presume that playing along with somebody that's in such wonder.  Form like that; it just spurs you on. 
 GRÉGORY BOURDY:  Yeah, of course, when you see that, you have to do the same, and yeah, I think it was a perfect day.  Sandy, he didn't play very well but it was good. 

 Q.  On The European Tour we're looking for sunshine every week but we haven't had an awful lot of it this year, so I imagine when you draw back the curtains at the crack of dawn this morning and there's no wind, you think, oh, this is bound to be a good score. 
 GRÉGORY BOURDY:  Yeah, the course is quite short, so with the weather like this, it's quite easy but it's never easy enough to play minus-11.  Yeah, it was perfect, conditions are perfect.  It was strange, all the year the weather, it was very bad, windy, rainy. 
 And then since the Dunhill, it's amazing, the weather is amazing.  I don't know why, but it's perfect, and I hope it's going to be the same in Mallorca next week. 

 Q.  Your form has been in all kinds of weather, but recent weeks, it's been nice, hasn't it? 
 GRÉGORY BOURDY:  Yeah, I think my long game, it's almost the same, but I think my putting is much better than at the start of the year.  So that's why, yeah, I play maybe better.
