Q. Did that actually feel like a win for you guys today?
MINJEE LEE: Well, I think Su played really well today.  I think she kept us in the match most times, and then I just holed the last putt.  That's pretty much it.  I think we did dodge a bullet, but yeah, it's nice to have the score.
Q. How important was it for Team Australia not being able to get a point on the board yesterday to come out in this first match and to give your partners behind you, able to see your score on the board?
SU OH: Well, I think it was very important for us to make it into Sunday.  We had a tough day yesterday, but we got it back together, and at the start we just thought, we can do this.  We just got out there and made lots of birdies.
