Q.   Unfortunately 4‑up with six to play and it didn't quite work out. 
SU OH:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   What happened out there? 
SU OH:   I don't know.   I just‑‑ you know, I've been a quarterfinalist the last two years.   Just can't get over this quarters jinx, I guess.   It just didn't work out.   She played great down the stretch, and I just fell apart.   I made par straight birdie.

Q.   I don't know if you can call that falling apart.   Was it not so much your game struggle as hers came alive?
SU OH:   Even when I was like 4‑up I wasn't playing well, and I guess she played better, and I just kept steady, like steadily bad.   Yeah, a couple putts, I hit them good, and they just didn't drop, and then I was like in between clubs on the 11th.   I hit a really good shot in and it just didn't happen, and she hit a really good shot in and finished it off.   So congratulations to her, I guess.   She played good down the stretch. 

Q.   Is there any particular part of your game you can point to as maybe that you were struggling the most with today?
SU OH:   I think my irons weren't very good, so I wasn't giving myself the opportunities I was giving myself the whole week.   Yeah, it wasn't great. 

Q.   Have you found out if you get to go home yet?
SU OH:   Yeah, I've already booked my flights, but I want to see if I can change them and go home early.   I've been away for so long.   I just want to go home.
