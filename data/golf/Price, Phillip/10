Q.   Welsh people are great golf supporters, how important and how good would it be to have a we will much champ I don't think which there has not been so far?
PHILLIP PRICE:   We've never had one.   I think Jamie Donaldson is probably the best Welsh golfer at the moment.   He's probably the only one with a realistic chance really.   Not sure how he's been playing recently but I know his ranking ‑‑ he's World Ranking is probably in the Top‑50, he's been playing in the Majors, and the rest have not been showing such good form but you never know. 

Q.   Weather forecast is amazing for this week; are you very much looking forward going out? 
PHILLIP PRICE:   I think we have had a fewwet Wales Opens. The forecast is good and the course is in great condition.   I think we are going to get some good crowds and hopefully it will be one of the best Wales Opens.
