  Q. Nice birdie at the last for 7-under.  
 PHILLIP PRICE: Nice to make so many birdies out there. Started well, a little quiet in the middle but I think making a couple birdies on 17 and 18 made it a nice day.  
  
  Q. One of those courses, isn't it, you have to get off to a good start.   
 PHILLIP PRICE: Yeah, I find it funny course, maybe seven holes that are quite strong holes but then all the rest are very easy, so you've got to make your birdies when you get your chances.  
  
  Q. Have you been threatening this? The form has been all right?  
 PHILLIP PRICE: I've been improving. I shot 65 in Italy, been making cuts, nothing really happening but I have.   
  
  Q. Is this a gradual thing that's come back?  
 PHILLIP PRICE: I've been playing better. I've had nothing great go on, a good round today and definitely things are on the up.  
  
  Q. Price and Dredge, too much the leaderboard?  
 PHILLIP PRICE: I think it's every week at the moment, Welsh names on the board. Seems every week, Rhys Davies and Jamie Donaldson has been playing well, the Dodd has been playing well.  
  
  Q. What about rice?  
 PHILLIP PRICE: Brilliant player. Obviously going to be involved in The Ryder Cup battle to make the team, great golfer, really good player.
