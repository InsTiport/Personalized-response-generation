 Q.  As leading Welsh man, how tough was that?  
PHILLIP PRICE: It's tough.  Struggling with my gloves the last hour.   
 Q.  Have you seen it like this?  
PHILLIP PRICE: No, never, because you wouldn't play.  But the course can take the rain, so we've got to play.   
 Q.  Today was a case a little bit like yesterday, good front nine and then one or two at the end got away from you?  
PHILLIP PRICE: I just finished -- well, I birdied the last.  It was a pretty similar day.  I don't know why I seem to play better the front nine than the back.   
 Q.  You're well placed going into the weekend.  Are you confident?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Yeah, I played pretty good today.   
 Q.  How do you dry out?  
PHILLIP PRICE: A couple of towels, a hot bath and a bit of dinner.   
 Q.  Have you ever experienced tougher conditions on a golf course?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Probably not as a pro.  Probably when we played the British Amateur here a long time ago I remember the weather similar.   
 Q.  Would you have taken 73 going out this morning?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Definitely.  I knew the weather was going to be really difficult.  I think the rain really made it look extra difficult, so I'm delighted with just a couple over.   
 Q.  Dinner will taste sweet with the birdie on the last.  
PHILLIP PRICE: Yesterday I bogeyed, so I was a little bit angry when I finished.  A birdie there will sweeten that dinner up.   
 Q.  A few off the lead, and by no means out of this championship.  
PHILLIP PRICE: Yeah, somewhere near it.  I haven't checked the weather forecast, and hopefully it's a little better and we can start to see some good golf.   
 Q.  What's the plan?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Dry off the gear, get some dinner and get rested.
