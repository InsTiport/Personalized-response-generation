 Q.  Nice to be back at the Old Course, a bit of nostalgia from the past, playing here again?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Been here for a lot of Dunhill Links.  Looking forward to the week before I started.  Perfect place to host this tournament.   
 Q.  Nice to be in today and feeding off each other?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Yeah, Paul played lovely.  He got to 7-under I think, maybe finished six but played lovely today.  Nice to watch.   
 Q.  Does it give a different sense of important when you come here?  
PHILLIP PRICE: This is probably the ultimate, if you said where do you want the Senior Open to go, this would be it.  I was told this would be the best field they have ever had for the event.  This is special.  We don't come here very often.  So you feel excited about coming.   
 Q.  What about your own scores here in the past?  
PHILLIP PRICE: I think I've had a 66 maybe in the Dunhill Links.  Probably played eight.  Eight was probably when I finished, nothing great.  I like the course but never had any great results here.   
 Q.  What were the highlights?  
PHILLIP PRICE: I putted great today.  I holed so many putts.  I should count my footage.  Those Champions Tour stats, I holed plenty.  The holes feel like buckets here.  They seem to go in from the sides, so I quite like these greens.   
 Q.  What do you feel about the prospects if you were to knock it around in, say, four 68s?  Would that be a good enough score?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Trying to think.  Possibly around there, I would say.  Depends how much it blows.  I think it's quite tricky the back nine.  It's pretty easy going out, but it's quite a big test.  Any bad shots, you're in some ugly bunkers.   
 Q.  That is St. Andrews, isn't it.  As soon as you hit the 12th tee and you turn for home, you're hanging on.  
PHILLIP PRICE: You're trying to hang on.
