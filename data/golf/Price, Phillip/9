Q.   Good round of golf?
PHILLIP PRICE:   Yeah, it was.   Didn't seem to hit the ball well but made so many putts today.

Q.   Your year has been intermittent, no real success but now back in the Welsh air, what's the difference?
PHILLIP PRICE:   I don't know.   I've played a little better the last couple of weeks.   Must be something about being home on my home course.

Q.   What about this course and what suits your game?
PHILLIP PRICE:   Usually it doesn't.   Usually it's a bit too long for me, especially off the back tees.   Yesterday played a little shorter because the fairways are running and today the fairways are running, it's a lot easier for me.

Q.   Did you come into this week with a little inner confidence thinking if it all went right, I could do something?
PHILLIP PRICE:   I practised and wasn't pretty, a little concerned on Wednesday.   Haven't hit it very well but hit a lot of putts.

Q.   Are you thinking that now?
PHILLIP PRICE:   Who knows.

Q.   What's the longest iron in your back? 
PHILLIP PRICE:   I have a 5‑iron in there.

Q.   It was a 6‑iron at one point‑‑
PHILLIP PRICE:   Starting to hit a little better so can get down to the five. 

Q.   You know The Ryder Cup is around the corner.   What can you tell the newbies that are playing for Europe to expect next week?
PHILLIP PRICE:   I think Darren Clarke gave me the best bit of advice.   Pulled me to one side and said, "Pricey, be ready, you're going to be more nervous than you've ever been before."       Which meant I was ready for being more nervous than I've ever been before, so I wasn't surprised.   I think if they think they are going to feel normal, they are going to be shocked. 

Q.   So the moment when you were on that tee, was it close?
PHILLIP PRICE:   Well, I think‑‑ couldn't breathe properly.

Q.   Just tell everybody what happened in the aftermath, the party, when you were carried in on the shoulders of people and Lee Westwood was the emcee?
PHILLIP PRICE:   Probably the catch phrase I hear every single week since, I shouted to Lee Westwood, "Tell them, Lee, who I beat."     

Q.   And of course you did beat? 
PHILLIP PRICE:   Phil Mickelson.
