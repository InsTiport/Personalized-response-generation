   PHILLIP PRICE: A bit more disappointed today. I struggled today. Played lovely yesterday and I would have loved to carry that on today but straight from the first hole, I wasn't hitting the ball as nicely as I would have liked. And it was just a battle out there. 

 Q. Conditions today worse than yesterday?
 PHILLIP PRICE: No, I thought they were much easier today but someone said the scoring wasn't great. I would have thought it would be quite good today but yesterday was very tough. 

 Q. A lovely putt on the 7th. 
 PHILLIP PRICE: Yeah, I made the odd one, but it was a struggle. I think I had very few birdie chances and never looked like doing anything better than shooting par. 

 Q. Can you put your finger on what that was? 
 PHILLIP PRICE: Just sometimes you start well I think, and get the flow of your swing, hitting, and you feel confident. Straight from the second shot on the first, my swing felt funny and I was trying to fix it as we were going around, and never really put my finger on it. Just battled with it.

 Q. How do you turn that around and fix it between now and Sunningdale?
 PHILLIP PRICE: I'm going to take a rest tonight, get on the range in the morning and see what I've got. It will need to be a little better than today. I'll just wake up, and some days you wake up and hit some good shots. I've got a couple ideas what I want to work on. 

 Q. Can you go home and turn the brain off quite well?
 PHILLIP PRICE: No, it will be churning tonight.
