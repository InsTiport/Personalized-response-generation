Q. You finished at plus one.  Are you happy or disappointed?
PHILLIP PRICE: I'm pretty pleased.  I played solid.  It's tough out there.  I thought it was going to be a dodgy day, but it was tidy.  Nothing exciting out there but it was also a tough day.  It's difficult to be shooting five or six birdies out there.
It was solid.  I needed a little bit more excitement, a pile of birdies, and it never looked like that really.  It was a bit of a workmanlike effort.  I need to be satisfied with that because it was tough out there.
Q. You're certainly in the Top-10, by far your best in a major.
PHILLIP PRICE: 2003 I finished 10th at St. George's.  I've never done great in the majors, so let's hope it's the senior majors I'm going to be good at.
Q. The Senior Tour, you're starting to like this.  Have you sort of reinvented yourself?
PHILLIP PRICE: I think so.  I probably lost my regular Tour card maybe three or four years ago.  Got a bit lost in the middle and nothing really to play in.  I think it's a new lease of life.  I'm playing the Champions Tour in America.  Doesn't get much better than that.
Q. Played well in a major and you've won two weeks ago; how well can you do this year?
PHILLIP PRICE: I'm playing the Champions Tour, and I need to finish in the top 36 to keep my status there.  At the moment I'm lying maybe 70th, and this counts, which is great.  I go back to America for maybe eight to ten weeks depending, if I get in the playoffs.  I need to play very well to finish in the top 36.
Q. What did you make of the event this week?
PHILLIP PRICE: It's a great event, a great course.  A shame we had the really bad weather Thursday, Friday.  Yesterday was beautiful.  Today it was a good test of golf.
Q. Bernhard seems unstoppable here.
PHILLIP PRICE: I haven't seen what he's on but he's in a different category with his play.
