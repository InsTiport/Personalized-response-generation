 Q.  Thoughts on that?  
PHILLIP PRICE: It was really tough out there but I was playing some lovely golf.  Probably expecting to be somewhere near the top of the leaderboard but obviously that didn't happen.  Need to catch up tomorrow.   
 Q.  With these conditions you need to be very patient now, yes?  
PHILLIP PRICE: It was really difficult.  We had some showers, as well.  Around 9, 10, 11 was really bad weather, very wet and windy, really gusty.  Difficult to control the ball.   
 Q.  You know the course well, but some of the toughest conditions you've played?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Definitely.  This was really windy today.   
 Q.  Winning score could be very high --  
PHILLIP PRICE: The forecast is bad tomorrow.  So I think it will be, 72 holes, a high score.  Just going to rest up and try to get myself ready for tomorrow, because I think it's going to be even tougher tomorrow.
