 Q.  How good was today?  
PHILLIP  PRICE: It was a nice finish to be honest.  I was 1-over going out, nothing really happening.  Didn't play that well.  4-under coming back, which is nice.   
 Q.  You're very much in the mix.  
PHILLIP  PRICE: Yeah, nice.  Like I said, nice to finish well and give myself back up the board.  I had dropped down to maybe plus six at stage.  So to get back to plus two is a good day.   
 Q.  Because you won the other day, does that give you more confidence to kick on Sunday?  
PHILLIP  PRICE: Probably does, I've got to say.  A win always gives you that good feeling when you're in contention.  Let's hope it does.   
 Q.  And mixed with your local knowledge, you'll be very well fancied tomorrow.  
PHILLIP  PRICE: I hope so.  I'm not sure what the weather will do tomorrow, but like you said, I've played here often enough, so I should be all right.   
 Q.  Will you try to attack because of the position you're in?  
PHILLIP  PRICE: It depends on the weather.  I haven't really looked at the weather to be honest but I'll just do my normal stuff and see what that brings.   
 Q.  What worked well for you today?  
PHILLIP  PRICE: Drove it well.  Probably kept a good attitude.   
 Q.  It's mentally, fatiguing, isn't it, this course?  
PHILLIP  PRICE: It can be.  It played a lot easier today.  I played the front nine, I felt like I let a lot of shots slip.  Because it was soft and windy, it played really easy today.   
 Q.  Did you have to go out and buy more towels after yesterday?  
PHILLIP  PRICE: I did.  I changed the bag and I've changed a lot of things in that bag to get some dry things in.
