 Q.  How difficult was that to play in?  
PHILLIP PRICE: That was really difficult.  I think the ball just doesn't go very far.  You've got water on the clubface, water on the ball, wind, and 180 yards into the last, and I hit a 4-iron which I hit 205 and didn't reach the hole.  It was a tough go.   
 Q.  You had five birdies; were you satisfied with how you played?  
PHILLIP PRICE: It was great early.  A real bad sort of middle of the back, I think three bogeys in four holes.  Managed to shoot 1-under for the last three, which probably saved my day a little bit.  2-under, could have been a little better, but still in the hunt.   
 Q.  Nice to finish like you did on 18?  
PHILLIP PRICE: I think it was nice, on the leaderboard most of the day, I make my three bogeys, I come off it, I'm struggling.  Making a birdie on the last probably got me within maybe three off the lead, which is a nice feeling at the moment.   
 Q.  It's a tight leaderboard.  Looking forward to tomorrow?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Yeah, looking forward to it.  I think we have the same weather.  A little bit of bad weather.  Let's hope everybody struggles.   
 Q.  Do you think that will suit you?  
PHILLIP PRICE: Yeah, probably suits me.  Yeah, probably a bit of a leveller.  Got my waterproofs on, waterproof glove, I'll be fine with a bit of bad weather.
