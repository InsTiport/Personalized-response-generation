Q. 10-under par, Top-10 finish.
PHILLIP PRICE: Yeah, that's nice.  Top-10, I played well at the British my last sort of senior major, I think I was fifth, so to get another one in quite so quickly is nice.
Q. And looking at the scores, you were par or better all weekend.
PHILLIP PRICE: I putted well yesterday and I played well pretty much all day today.  Bogeyed 7, I think that was my only bogey, but played nicely, holed out nicely and was in a good place.  So 4-under, it's a tough old golf course, plenty of trouble, so I was delighted with that.
Q. Great start to the season.  7th in the UAE, Top-10 here and you can really look forward to the rest of the year.
PHILLIP PRICE: I lost my Champions Tour card last year so back to Europe, which is great, but I would like to kind of kick on a little bit now and do well in Europe.  The tour is looking great at the moment for us, so I'm looking forward to that as well.  So it's nice to get off and running, you kind of get your confidence and get ready for a good season.
Q. Particularly important when you got a big stretch of tournaments coming up.
PHILLIP PRICE: It's exactly now.  The tour starts now.  We had a nice tournament in March, but we got a big run of tournaments all the way through, so you want to find your form straight away.
