Q.   Talk about your day. 
MIKE GOODES:   Yeah, it was really hard with the wind today.   These greens, these are difficult greens, and when the wind is blowing, it's hard to get the distance down. 
That's what happened to me.   I knocked it over a couple of par‑3s.   And one I made double bogey, I got in a bad position in the bunker and barely could get out.   And another one I knocked it over and just couldn't get it up‑and‑down. 
And it's just a hard course.   I mean, that back nine with the wind blowing and the front nine with the wind blowing too.

Q.   Do you think it's more the wind than the pin placement?
MIKE GOODES:   Yeah, I think that with the greens as difficult as they are, well you don't need any wind.   You need to be able to control your irons.   At least we think we can control them.   And if you're hitting them good and you know you hit a 7‑iron 160 yards, and all of a sudden you catch a gust and it hits and goes 140 or 170, depending upon which way it goes, then it's really difficult. 

Q.   Probably the greens themselves, you probably didn't have a straight putt all day. 
MIKE GOODES:   Well they're firm ‑‑ well, unless it was real short.   And it got firm this afternoon.   It was the front side, which was our front was the back, but the greens, the ball hardly makes a ball mark anymore.   They will water them some tonight, I guess, and it will be different tomorrow.   But it's tough.   It's really tough.
