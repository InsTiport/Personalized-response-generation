 Q.   Talk about the round today.   Great finish at 1‑under.   
MIKE GOODES:   Thank you.   I played pretty steady.   I got off to a nice start, I birdied on 11.   
Came right back with a bogey.   
But then I birdied 14 and 16.   
Unfortunately, bogeyed 17 and 18.   But I hit good shots and lipped out a couple putts.   
But I played good on the back side, which was the front, my back side.   I birdied 1.   I hit it really close for birdie.   
I played solid the rest of the way.   I hit greens and made lots of pars.  
   
 Q.   So your first nine was more up‑and‑down than the second nine, more consistent.   What was your mentality heading into that second nine?  
MIKE GOODES:   Well I wasn't happy about bogeying the last two holes, but I knew that anything par or a little better was a good round today, so I just kept hitting good shots and gave myself some opportunities.   And I had opportunity, I must missed a good putt on 6, a really good birdie putt on 6.   
Then I had some other decent chances.
