 Q. Could you just recap your eagle on 16. 
 MIKE GOODES: I hit a good tee shot, I hit 3-wood down the right side of the split fairway and it was down wind and it was playing really short. And I hit a 6-iron second shot, kind of bounced it up, it rolled up about, I guess it was maybe 20 feet. And I made a good putt. It was one of the few holes I hit all the good shots on. 

 Q. Just your mindset going into Sunday. 
 MIKE GOODES: I just will try to play good tomorrow. Hit the first tee shot and see where it goes.
