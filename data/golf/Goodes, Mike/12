  Q. What was the course like today? How do you feel?  
 MIKE GOODES: Plus five total today. Plus three today. You know, I felt like that I'm in okay shape. I threw away a couple shots coming in, that hurt me. But I'm all right.   
 It's a tough golf course. 2 or 3-over every day is not bad -- it ain't going win, but it's not bad.  
  
  Q. What was the differences on the course today versus yesterday?  
 MIKE GOODES: There's not as much wind today. I think the pins were a little easier today. I really didn't hit the ball as good today, I didn't drive it as good today as I did yesterday. Hitting out of the fairway you got a lot of chances for birdies today.   
  
  Q. What do you have to do Saturday and Sunday?  
 MIKE GOODES: To try to win I think I have to be par or better. I think -- I don't know what it's going to take. I would think that somewhere even or 2- or 3-over, you know, may be in it.
