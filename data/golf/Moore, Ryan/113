  Q. Just a couple general comments. Obviously not the way you wanted it to go. A little bit about what happened out there.   
 RYAN MOORE: Well, he played great. He made six or seven birdies. I knew I had to play well against him. I just made him a little too comfortable.   
 I didn't put too much pressure on him early on and kind of gave a couple of holes to him. You can't give holes away. I did that a couple of times early and let him pad his lead and from there I think he just cruised.
