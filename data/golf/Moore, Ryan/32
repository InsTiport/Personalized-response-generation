 Q.  Were you able to carry the momentum over even though it was overnight?  
RYAN MOORE: Definitely.  Just had good numbers, good putts early on.  Same thing late in the day yesterday, just had some shots that looked really nice to me.  Was able to roll in some great putts yesterday afternoon.   
This morning was just some really nice, crisp irons and wedges, just getting great opportunities.   
 Q.  3-up advantage here after five holes.  What are you thinking at that stage?  
RYAN MOORE: I mean, when you are playing against the best players in the world, nothing is safe.  You are just trying to keep the pedal down and keep going and build as much a lead as possible.  That's what I'm thinking the whole time out there.  At any moment any one of these guys could rattle off five, six, seven birdies in a row.   
For me it's just keep trying to hit good shots, keep putting pressure on the guy to have to respond.   
 Q.  Do you come into this week (inaudible)?  
RYAN MOORE: Yeah, I've been playing some solid golf lately.  I always enjoy match play.  Like I said yesterday, we don't get to do it much.  It's fun.  It's different.  Definitely a different mentality out there.  Took me a of couple days to get back into this week.  But I've been swinging it well and putting pretty well, and that's usually a good combination.   
 Q.  Rafa Cabrera Bello this afternoon.  Have you ever played with him?  
RYAN MOORE: Yeah, I think I've played with him a time or two.  Obviously a great player, just got to go play some good golf.
