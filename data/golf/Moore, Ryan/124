  Q. Talk about the finish, what you need to be able to control yourself coming down the stretch.   
 RYAN MOORE: Well, I mean, the last two holes are pretty tough. You have a fairly scorable par-5 there with 16. Just getting it in the fairway is a tough drive, though. 17 is a good, tough par-3 that definitely gets your attention. And then 18, you've just got to get it in the fairway, and that's what I haven't really been able to do yet. I was unfortunate to make a couple bogeys to finish the last couple rounds, so obviously I'm not too happy about that. But I'll see if I can get a little better tomorrow.  
  
  Q. If you're four or five shots back with 18 holes to play on this golf course, is it possible to make that up, or is this the type of course that's tough to make up a deficit?   
 RYAN MOORE: No, I think the tougher the golf course, the bigger swing that can be made, because there are -- Justin showed yesterday, there are some low scores out here. You can shoot 4-, 5-, 6-under. It is possible. You really have to play some good golf, though. And then at the same time you can play pretty solid golf and shoot 1- or 2-over. I think it's possible to make a big jump here.  
  
  Q. Are you playing well enough to win tomorrow?   
 RYAN MOORE: You know, I'm very happy with my game right now. I feel like I really haven't got a lot out of the last three days here. I haven't -- I don't even think I've birdied a par-5 yet. Hopefully I can put it all together tomorrow and see what happens.
