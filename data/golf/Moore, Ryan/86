 Q.   Fabulous week, 22â€‘under, you have to be feeling good about everything.   
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, I'm definitely happy with the way this week went.   I got a couple of weeks of practice before I came in here.   I finally got a time to really get the TaylorMade stuff dialed in for the last two weeks, so that was huge for me.   I felt comfortable all week with my equipment.   I felt I performed above and beyond anything I have seen in a long time out of my game.  
You know, I'm very encouraged and looking forward to a couple weeks in LA.  
   
 Q.   Coming back here, obviously a familiar spot, it's near and dear to you.   Crowds this week, is this a special week for you?  
RYAN MOORE:   I love this event, I really do.   It's easy to let it get under your skin every once in a while, but overall for me, it has just a great tournament feel, feels like a real golf tournament.   I think the atmosphere is great.   I think what they do here is brilliant.
