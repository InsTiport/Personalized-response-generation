 Q.   Off to a great start, 6‑under today in round 1.   Just some comments on the round.   
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, it was just a good, solid, I believe bogey‑free round.   Yeah, I've just been doing a lot of things well lately.   I'm hitting the ball well, been really for the last few weeks and finally started converting some putts last week.   That's carrying through to this week.  
   
 Q.   How much of the course did you get to see before today?  
RYAN MOORE:   I saw the front nine yesterday, so I played the back nine blind my first nine today and shot 4‑under.   Kind of crazy how that happens.   But you know, in these type of conditions where you're not chasing balls through fairways and the greens are fairly receptive, knowing the course really well isn't quite as important just because you don't have to worry about the angles as much if the fairways are softer like this.   I was able to hit it really well my first nine and never really get myself in trouble.
