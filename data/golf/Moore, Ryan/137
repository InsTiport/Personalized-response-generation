 Q. Just a couple of comments on the round. You obviously are in the best position you can be in, got to come back tomorrow at 7:45 and play one hole. 
 Talk a little bit about the day and how you kept the momentum going.
 RYAN MOORE: It was a great day. I really enjoyed it. I've always -- personally, always practice in the last afternoon so, you know, for me it was very comfortable being out there, you know, that time of day. 
 But, yeah, it was a great day. It was a lot like yesterday, just, you know, real solid ball striking. I made one bogey today where -- to zero yesterday.
 Just made good putts when I hit good shots. That's really what I did all day. I didn't -- I made one decent length putt, about 25, 30-footer. All the other ones were inside that 15-foot range again.

 Q. You just feeling overall confident about the whole game?
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah. Ball striking is solid. I'm just putting it in play which is what you have to do on this course and, you know, I'm hitting my irons solid, not amazing but solid, and just hitting a lot of greens and just what I do. For me, that's all I'm trying to do is give myself opportunities.

 Q. So you'll go to sleep tonight with one hole to come back out in the morning?
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah.

 Q. You just stick with what's been working for you?
 RYAN MOORE: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Tomorrow is going to be a little weird, kind of go warm up a little bit, go out and hit three shots, hopefully, and, you know, be done and then go sit for awhile or go back to the hotel or kill sometime because, you know, I'm sure I'll -- I will be one of the later tee times so -- yeah, I just -- got to keep doing what I'm doing. That's just putting the ball in play and giving myself chances.
