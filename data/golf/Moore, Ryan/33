 Q.  Good victory.  Looked like the front nine was pretty spectacular and solid back nine for you?  
RYAN MOORE: I hit some good shots early and made some great putts.  Definitely put pressure on him to have to respond.  He honestly hit a lot of great putts and it looked like he was going to make a lot of them, just barely missing.  Fortunately, mine were going in.   
 Q.  You've got a short break for lunch.  Cabrera Bello in the afternoon.  Have you played him before?  
RYAN MOORE: I have not.  I think I've played with him a time or two, but I've never played against him.  He's a great player.  Obviously, to make it this far in this week, you are doing something right.   
Just same as what I've done the last few days.  Go out and I know how I'm playing the golf course and how I like to attack it and see if that works.   
 Q.  One last comment about the atmosphere out here this morning?  
RYAN MOORE: It's been fantastic all week to be honest.  There was a lot of people out here Wednesday.  For a Wednesday, it was very impressive.  To get that kind of support first year at a venue like this in this area, you can tell this is going to be a great event in the future.
