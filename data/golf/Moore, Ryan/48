 Q.   Tied for the low round of the day.   Tough conditions at times out there, but there were some low scores out there, weren't there?  
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, you know, this golf course, the thing that's so great about it is that there's always bogeys lurking, but if you hit the right shot and play the hole right, you're going to have a reasonable chance at birdie.   
I found myself with quite a few reasonable birdie chances.  
   
 Q.   How good was the up‑and‑down for you?   How big was that for you?  
RYAN MOORE:   That was huge, after hitting a good tee shot down there and just hitting a terrible second shot.   But that's what's fun around here.   You always kind of have those shots.   There's always a way to get it around the hole.   And I pulled that one off nicely.  
   
 Q.   Jordan Spieth at 14‑under.   How impressive is what he's done over these first two days for the record setting performance in a Major Championship?  
RYAN MOORE:   It's incredible.   He's a great player.   There's no doubt about it.   I'm just playing hard and just seeing what can happen.
