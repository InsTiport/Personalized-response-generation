Q. Obviously, wasn't a third win in a row, but still a solid finish.  Just overall thoughts on your week.
RYAN MOORE: Yeah, it was a good solid week.  It was nothing special.  I shot the same score as I did last year, and I got lapped by a lot of other people.
So, obviously, the conditions -- rough wasn't quite as long, greens were a little bit softer, and there just wasn't a breath of wind for four straight days, so it was just optimum scoring conditions.
I was joking around with Patrick on 15 green there, saying if someone told me I could have had 17-under standing on the 15th green with three holes to go in the tournament, I would have said yeah at the beginning of the week.
And I was barely even inside the top-10 at that point.  So, that's just funny how a tournament can just play a little different year in and year out.
So overall, yeah, I played pretty well, but not good enough.
