 Q.   Playing out there today, knowing what Phil is doing, does it free you up at all for any reason?  
RYAN MOORE:   Oh, not necessarily.   You just know you've got to go shoot a great score to make up any ground the way he's playing.   And I did play a pretty solid round.   I don't think I made up anything at this point.  
You've just got to approach tomorrow and keep your head down and keep playing hard.   Never know what's going to happen.  
   
 Q.   You played the first couple of weeks in Hawaii and haven't played the last few weeks.   What have you been working on in the off times?  
RYAN MOORE:   A lot of stuff.   I have been working with my equipment a little bit with all the new TaylorMade stuff, really talking great stuff and I'm really happy I have the last few weeks to work on all that.   Just feeling comfortable out there this week.  
   
 Q.   Are you still putting with the same putter, or did you switch putters, as well?   
RYAN MOORE:   No, that one remains the same from the end of last year.   I really started rolling it well.   My younger brother comes out and helps me early in the week and kind of gets me down in there.  
Every week he comes out I seem to putt better and better.   Of course I have a great brother like that who is willing to come out and help me.  
   
 Q.   Does he charge you a lot?  
RYAN MOORE:   Not thus far, but if I keep playing like this, I think it's going to get steep here.   I don't mind that.   I will take a few more wins.  
   
 Q.   Money well spent?  
RYAN MOORE:   Exactly.
