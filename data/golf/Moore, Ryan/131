  Q. Nice start and a better finish?  
 RYAN MOORE: It was a good start to make eagle (on the second hole) to go to two under right away but it was not too good in the middle there but I found some life to birdie the last two holes and I can go home with a little better taste in my mouth and also in a better position for sure.  
  
  Q. Conditions were tough obviously?  
 RYAN MOORE: The greens are firm and fast and with the blustery wind, it made the course a lot more difficult.  
  
  Q. You'll sleep better tonight after getting closer to Phil?  
 RYAN MOORE: Absolutely. You want to be as close as possible especially with some one like Phil leading and with Tiger right up there as well. I will have to shoot a good round tomorrow. I was just trying to get as much back at the end and actually had a chance for eagle but missed it from 10 feet. I'm happy with where I'm at. I misread the putt. I thought it would go pretty straight but it went a little right on me.  
  
  Q. Have you got a number in mind for tomorrow?  
 RYAN MOORE: No I don't think in numbers. I'll just play as good as I can and we'll see how it goes tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Your game looks solid?  
 RYAN MOORE: My game has been solid this week. It's close. I know I have a good round in me and we'll see if I can get it out of me tomorrow.
