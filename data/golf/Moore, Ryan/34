Q. A lot of scenarios in play.  But how proud are you of your performance?
RYAN MOORE: I'm definitely proud of how I played and how I thought out the day.  The match was really up and down.  I gave him a couple of holes in the middle on 7 and 8, I missed a couple of 5-footers for par.  And then made a huge putt on 9 when he had already stuffed it to a foot, and I had to make an eight or nine footer for birdie.  Made that one.
Kind of did the same thing on 10, again, I made about an 18-footer.  And that just kind of kept me in there.  And I just kept hanging around and was able to get some momentum late in the round.
Made a great putt on 13 just with a ton of break.  And I think that was a big momentum swing in the match, making that.  He missed.
On the next hole I made a 20-footer for par, and just kept rolling from there, making great putts.
Q. You survive and you advance.  Do you enjoy playing that format or the pool play format?
RYAN MOORE: I think I understood the pool play format.  I think I liked the changes they made to it.  I actually like the half points and the playoff, just after however many points you have at the end, if you're tied, you have to go on and beat the guy.
I think in pool play it's not about head-to-head, it's about pool play.  I think the changes are good.  There is something very simple about just going out there and I've got to win to move on and if not I go home.  So I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
