Q.   You started 31 on the front nine, you were red hot.   What were you thinking making the turn?
RYAN MOORE:   Well, I was hitting shots and definitely making putts.   Obviously made the turn, wanted to try to make more birdies.
Then on 11, hit some other pretty good shots. 
The next few holes, didn't do great.   And unfortunately didn't hit a great shot on 16, hit an even worse bunker shot, but it was nice to bounce back on 17 and make a birdie and finish the hole. 

Q.   Yeah, the 17th shot was really good.   Number one, you bounced back.   But that's a tough hole?
RYAN MOORE:   It is.   It is with the type of club I'm hitting, midâ€‘iron, in there.   So it's not an easy green, and the wind at that point is a little bit up and down and I was kind of in between clubs.   So took a little bit longer club and just kind of worked one in there, and it turned out to be what I needed it to be.

Q.   The course condition, how good is it?   It looks awesome out there. 
RYAN MOORE:   It's perfect.   The rough is long enough, it punishes you if you're in it.   You can miss some fairways.   The fairways here are so good.   And obviously the greens, are, I think, the best we putt on all year.
