 Q.  Another solid round of golf, including that birdie at the 9th, gets you to 5-under for the day, 16-under for 54 holes, your thoughts on how it went out there for you today.  
RYAN MOORE: I didn't like how I played today quite as much as I liked where yesterday was at, but it was, overall it was still a very solid round of golf. Hit a couple looser tee shots than I did the last couple days, but put them in the right spots at least, so still had some chances. And it was just, it's been some good solid steady golf to start the season for me, it's been good.   
 Q.  Right now you're tied for third, there's not a lot of guys between you and the leaders who are in the low 20s right now. What's your approach for tomorrow?  
RYAN MOORE: Just keep trying to do what I'm doing. This course is a little tricky, but at the same time it's just perfect scoring conditions and no wind, so that takes the teeth out of it a little bit. So I might be teeing off in a place where it's basically uncatchable tomorrow, but just go out and play as hard as I can and get a good finish out of it and keep moving forward.
