 Q.   Great opening round, 6‑under par, but that's about as worse as you could have done?  
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, I hit the ball nicely today.   I controlled it around the golf course, which was encouraging.   Obviously would have loved to have made a couple more putts, especially I missed quite a few really makeable ones those last six, seven holes.   Overall, I loved how I played and the way I had controlled the ball, so you know, obviously encouraged going forward.   
   
 Q.   It's been almost three months since you won in Malaysia but still riding momentum from there?  
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, you know, I've been putting in some good work and gaining confidence and just feeling better about my game in general.   So you know, I'm just stepping out with maybe a little bit more confidence than I've had in years, and just trying to play golf.   
   
 Q.   You missed some putts on the back nine.   Is that green, is it a number of different things?   
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, sometimes the green just gets in your head more than it actually moves the ball.   For a West Coaster that doesn't putt on much grain like me, sometimes you over‑think it and sometimes you under‑think it.   It's tricky, and these greens, obviously there's a lot of slope to them and there's a lot of grain.   Sometimes you guess right, and sometimes you don't.
