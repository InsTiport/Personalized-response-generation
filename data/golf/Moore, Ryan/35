RYAN MOORE: Match play is just crazy.  You just never know what's going to happen.  I honestly didn't think I hit too bad a shot down 17.  The wind carried it over the green there.  Honestly I had a great lie.  I've hit a lot of great putts all day.  I was standing over it thinking something has got to go in eventually.  I hit it exactly where I wanted to and it rolled out perfect.  Halfway there I thought it was going to stop a little short, but it caught that front edge and dropped.  Then he knocked it right on top of me.
So standing here on 18, I knew he was in great position down there below.  It's one of those, try and stuff it, knock it in there tight.
Q. I was speaking to the runner-up of the Club Championship at Austin Country Club, he said it was advantage you on 18 because lying back to where you did with this hole location is the smart play.  More birdies are made from the top than down at the bottom where Sergio was.
RYAN MOORE: I can see that.  It's a little bit of an uncomfortable shot.  He's so great with those short wedges.  I wasn't banking on him hitting it outside of eight feet, to be honest.  In my mind I'm thinking let's go up top.  Exposed, with the amount of wind we've had today, it's not exactly the most comfortable shot even when you're hitting a wedge or 9-iron.  One little gust and you're 20 yards short.  I hit a really crisp solid shot exactly how I wanted to and it worked out.
Q. With 1.5 points already, you are in control of your destiny heading into Friday?
RYAN MOORE: Absolutely.  I learned a little bit last year, playing this format and kind of seeing how it works.  You have got to get wins early.  As soon as you get behind, you don't control your own destiny.  It's up to somebody else.  It's nice being in that position, but obviously I have got a great opponent tomorrow.
