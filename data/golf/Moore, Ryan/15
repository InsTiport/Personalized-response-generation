 Q.  An interesting round, hole-out eagle on the third and another on the fifth and a couple birdies in your 6-under par, 67.  Did you enjoy yourself out there on the Plantation Course?  
RYAN MOORE: Absolutely.  We enjoy it every time.  Yeah, it was an interesting way to start a round.  I don't think I've ever been 4-under through five holes or whatever and not make a birdie.   
It was nice to hole out on 3, and then hit a great shot there into the par 5 and was able to knock that putt in.  Yeah, nice way to start the year.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you've got a lot of momentum coming into 2017?  
RYAN MOORE: Absolutely.  I started doing some great work with a new trainer at the end of the season last year, and that really got me going.  Got me feeling better.  Just little things that were bothering me here and there, and body is feeling better.  And having the whole off-season to kind of prepare and get ready for this year, I'm really excited about what I can do out here.   
 Q.  Another nice start out here for you?  
RYAN MOORE: It was an interesting round of golf today, and in the end it was a good score.  Started out with a couple eagles early in the round, and you know, just played some really solid golf.  I honestly burned a lot of edges, hit a lot of good putts.  So you know, I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.   
 Q.  During the off time, what did Ryan Moore get up to?  
RYAN MOORE: A whole lot of nothing to be honest.  I tried to do that as much as possible.  Just hang out with friends and family.  I trained a lot with my trainer.  Got the body feeling good and better, and probably the most physically prepared I have been for any season.  So that was huge for me just to come into this week just feeling better.
