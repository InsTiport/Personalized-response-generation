Q. Ryan, another great round today, 4 under.  You got off to a better start today.  What was it about those first few holes?  Were they set up a little easier for you or just something clicked?
RYAN MOORE: No.  I just hit a great shot there into 1 with a 6 iron from 205 or so.  I mean, it's not a pin I was exactly trying to attack, but I was able to hit it in there to five or six feet and convert that.  Hit another solid iron into 2 and was able to convert a nice 18-footer there.  It was a nice start to the day, kind of got me jump-started in a positive direction.
Q. Another positive direction.  You're 6 under total and now just a few strokes off the lead.  What kind of mindset do you take into tomorrow?
RYAN MOORE: Well, I mean, there's a lot hanging out there tomorrow.  The best thing for me is just to focus on the task at hand, and that's trying to put the best round I can together tomorrow and see where that lands me in the end.  There's so many variables.  There's so many things that can happen.  Of all the days to just try and stay patient, try to hit one shot at a time and not worry about that stuff tomorrow, it's going to be a really big day for that.
