  Q. Pretty solid round of golf.   
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah, I'm definitely not complaining. It's a great golf course, but it's straightforward, and if you hit good shots, you get rewarded with good spots, and I fortunately kept it on the correct side of the hole quite a few times and actually had some good opportunities on the second nine.  
  
  Q. Have you played a practice round in the morning when the greens might be a little softer, or do you think it's easier with the firmer greens trying to get to some of these holes?  
 RYAN MOORE: It's hard to say. I kind of go either way. Today I thought it was definitely playing tough, but I ended up on the right yardages with the right clubs, and like I said, just kept it on the correct side of the hole, which is a little tough with them bouncing as much as they were. But I tried everything I could to keep it underneath the hole as much as possible, and I managed to get a few putts I could be aggressive with.
