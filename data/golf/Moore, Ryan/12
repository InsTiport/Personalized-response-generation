 Q.  Tight match obviously, but got to be thrilled to get out of that with a halve, I guess?  
RYAN MOORE: Yeah, I mean, I hit a great shot in there.  I thought he had a tougher yardage and he stuffs it inside me.  I had a putt obviously I had to make.  I still think I have some life for tomorrow.  Depends on -- it's up to Tanihara and Ikeda's match more than anything.  At least I have some hope.  I can go try and play hard tomorrow and get a point and see what happens.   
 Q.  Can you remember playing in more difficult conditions wind wise?  
RYAN MOORE: No.  This was just -- yeah, it was just crazy all day long.  Everything, every shot.  Nothing was comfortable, everything was difficult.
