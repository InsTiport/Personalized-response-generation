Q.   The putt was for 6‑under?
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, it was.

Q.   You have been here a few times.   You are fondly aware of the curse and everything?
RYAN MOORE:   Oh, yeah.   I'm not afraid of it.   You never know, someone has got to break that curse at some point in time, so hopefully it's me, if I end up winning.   Who knows?   I might go shoot 8‑under or something, make a couple hole‑in‑ones.   We'll see.

Q.   Did you hit one any closer than that today?
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, I had two.   No. 4, I hit it to about six inches. 
I hit it closer on 6.   I hit it to about two and a half feet.   So I had some nice tap‑ins or close ones, at least.   I missed a couple of six‑footers, too.

Q.   In terms of the tournament, was it for preparation or was it just like for the family?
RYAN MOORE:   It was fun having my boy out there and playing a round, you know, playing with a couple of friends.   That's what it's for, to kind of make you relax a little bit and just go and enjoy yourself the afternoon before. 
Now I have to stick around to 6 o'clock tonight to make sure.   So we'll see. 

Q.   Did you think it's kind of better than playing a round?   Would you prefer this than playing a round in the afternoon? 
RYAN MOORE:   You know, I got in the amount of golf I wanted to get in before this, so for me today this was perfect.   I got a good practice session in, you know, then able to go do this, and now I'm going to get a little more practice in and work on a couple of things and call it a day.   So I mean, it was kind of a perfect practice day for me.
