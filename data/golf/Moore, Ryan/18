 Q.  Ryan Moore, from final pick from Davis Love III, from the captain's pick to clinching the Ryder Cup for the United States.  What has been the range of emotions for you the last eight days?  
RYAN MOORE: I mean, I don't even know.  I mean, this is unbelievable right now.  To actually get the point that clinched it for us.  Obviously we had some great play going on behind me.  I was able to relax and play those last couple of holes and able to sneak a win out there.   
 Q.  In your amateur career, you were a phenomenal match play player.  What makes you so comfortable and so good in this format?  
RYAN MOORE: I don't know.  Something simple about it.  You are just trying to beat one guy.  Man, when I went 2-down with 3 to go, I didn't want to let my team down.  I wanted to do everything I could and try to hit a couple great shots coming in.  Was able to eagle 16, which was huge.  That birdie on 17 and then to win with the par on the last hole, it's -- honestly, I don't even know what to tell you.  It's incredible.
