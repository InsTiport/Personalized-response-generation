 Q.   Are you pretty happy with your start?  
RYAN MOORE:   Absolutely.   I started out the day bogeying the first hole, hitting it in a bunker, couldn't get it to the green, hit a bad pitch and then a bad putt.   And then just kind of got some‑‑ kind of got rolling after that, was able to birdie the second hole, got me feeling a little better, and just kind of cruised around.  
   
 Q.   You're one of the first groups out.   How was the course playing?  
RYAN MOORE:   I mean, it's soft.   Ball is not running too much in the fairways.   I think by these afternoon times the ball‑‑ it started rolling the last few holes, so definitely playing pretty long, but the greens are receptive, so you can hit 5‑irons and 4‑irons into the greens and stop them around the hole.   
You know, it was longer but still scorable.   
   
 Q.   What was working for you out there?   
RYAN MOORE:   I drove it great today and then hit some really good, solid long iron shots.   You know, it was just one of those days where it took a little bit of everything.   I made a couple good putts, hit a couple great chips and pitches, and just put it all together.
