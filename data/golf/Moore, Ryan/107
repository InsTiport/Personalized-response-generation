 Q. Surprised things went to well today?
 RYAN MOORE: I had a nice week off last week, actually didn't practice too much. But the last couple days before I came up here, I got a couple good practice sessions in and honestly swing is probably the best it's really felt all year. So it was just a good practice session with my dad, and we had fun and found a little something in the swing that felt good and carried through.

 Q. You only missed four greens, only made one bogey. Pretty stress-free?
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah, maybe it was the loosest I've felt all year, kind of relaxing and playing golf. I've kind of been fighting my swing here and there, so to kind of feel comfortable and to be able to cruise around and hit some good iron shots, that's really what I've struggled with this year. And I hit some great iron shots today, so it was nice to see that work I've done kind of pay off.

 Q. I would think you would love a good old-fashioned, traditional northern course like this. 
 RYAN MOORE: I do, yeah. It's visually great off the tee, and you've got to put it in the right spots around the greens. I love it, and a little softer conditions aren't too bad for scoring.
