 Q.   You are happy to win this thing?   
RYAN MOORE:   Of course.   I'm one of those people, if I'm entering something, I'm trying to win it no matter what.   I don't believe in any of that other stuff about, you know, the curse or whatever.   I mean, the reality is the odds of winning both are not very high.   So you know, just hasn't happened yet.   So obviously I'm happy to be the first person to break that.   
We've got a long week ahead of us.   We've got to play a lot of good golf.   It was good to see some good solid shots today at least and made some putts.  
   
 Q.   Is it as much about, you know, seeing the ball go in the hole and just getting that positive frame of mind going into the weekend?   
RYAN MOORE:   Absolutely.   I've been putting a lot of work on with my wedges with my coach.   To come out and hit a bunch of good wedges, that's just good positive, you know, reinforcement that we're working on good stuff.   I hit a few tap‑ins and the rest of the shots were great looking shots.   That's obviously a positive.   
As much as anything it was just fun.   I had my wife out there.   I had my 17‑month‑old boy out there.   I was chasing him, watching him try to jump in bunkers.  
   
 Q.   What's his name?  
RYAN MOORE:   Tucker.   As much as anything, it was a fun day and it was nice to make a few birdies.  
   
 Q.   Is that the first time you have won some crystal or glassware?  
RYAN MOORE:   No, I actually have a bit of crystal.   This is adding to the collection.   I made a hole‑in‑one on No. 16 a few years back, so I got some pretty awesome crystal for that.   I made two other eagles besides this.   I have a little bit of crystal and I'm making the collection.   I want as big a collection as possible of the crystal.
