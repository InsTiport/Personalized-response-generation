  Q.  Disappointing to start the day with a three-shot lead and find yourself three back going into Sunday?   
 RYAN MOORE:  Yeah, but I'm still in there.  The goal of the game is to give yourself a chance on Sunday.  I'm not completely out of it.  Just was hanging on all day long.  Couldn't get any putts to go in, and really just going to go practice and work it out for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Speaking of tomorrow, what do you draw on?  It's a place you've been a few times but what's going to putt you over the hump to get your first victory in a TOUR event?   
 RYAN MOORE:  Ball-striking needs to stay solid and keep giving myself chances.  Just going to go work out my putting like I said and be ready for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Last Sunday at Vegas, your transformation from Saturday to Sunday you brought here this week; feel good about your position?   
 RYAN MOORE:  Yeah, feeling good about how I'm playing right now and excited to have a chance tomorrow, and I'm feeling better than I have in a really long time.
