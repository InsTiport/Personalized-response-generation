 Q.   Good playing, the second straight 66.   Just talk about the day.   
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, it was just a good, solid day overall, kind of started out with a good up‑and‑down on the first hole, then I got rolling from there and was able to make a couple birdies, a couple nice putts early in the round.   The greens are just rolling great, probably the best I've seen them rolling maybe in my career playing here.   
   
 Q.   Any highlights to the day, anything that stood out?   
RYAN MOORE:   No, nothing too crazy.   Made a couple longish putts, some 20‑ to 30‑footers, and I did that yesterday, too.   I'm making putts, which is nice.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the start to your year to this point.   
RYAN MOORE:   It's been fairly uneventful.   I played Kapalua, didn't play real well there.   I played the Sony and missed the cut by one.   I'm trying to kick‑start it this week and playing quite a bit over the next eight weeks, so just trying to get a nice little start to this stretch.
