  Q. You can kind of look at this two ways.   
 RYAN MOORE: I'm only looking at it one way and that's that it was a really solid round on a pretty darn tough day. It's one of those days where it could get away from you really quickly.   
 Just with the wind up-and-down the way it was I was happy to hit really solid golf shots until the very last hole. That was the first shot I didn't hit well all day. Overall I shot very solid and felt really comfortable today and made a few good putts and threatened the hole a lot.  
  
  Q. It seemed like a pretty stress-free round because you hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens. Only Amen Corner seemed to be the most difficult.   
 RYAN MOORE: I don't think you can ever have a round out here that's not a little bit stressful. But for me it was, I attacked on the holes that I was planning on. And I thought I should try to just make a lot of pars. Hit it in the fairways and hit it on the green and make a lot of pars. And I started out that way today doing that.   
 So I'm feeling good, I'm comfortable with the course and with my swing.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 RYAN MOORE: I can't really explain how hard that shot was. It was actually impossible. I was on the down slope because I hit up high in the bunker, almost buried it, and it rolled all the way back down under, so it was on the down slope.   
 And I had obviously a, the ball barely got over the lip of the bunker, but that's what I had to do. But I don't think I could have hit it any higher than that if I tried. And it just perfectly clipped the top of the hill and checked and popped over and then hit the pin. It would have been going forever. I would have been really happy with anything inside of eight feet from that position.
