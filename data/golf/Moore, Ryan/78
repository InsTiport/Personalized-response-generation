 Q.   Ryan, I guess a solid, if unspectacular start is there to defend your champion out here.  
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah, it was just one of those days, it was beautiful.   Really couldn't have a nicer day, except it was a little chilly this morning.   But no wind, and this golf course is definitely very scorable and the scores are showing that.  
But you know, I just never got any great momentum, just kind of kept hitting wedges and 9‑irons to 18 feet, 20 feet, 25 feet.   And you know, it was one of those days if I could have just got one of those to drop and maybe get a little positive momentum, it might have turned things around.   I just kept burning edges, and overall, couple under, not going to kill me.   Obviously I know what I gotta do from here.  
   
 Q.   Nice one‑putt pars for you at 7 and 8.  
RYAN MOORE:   Yeah.   That was nice.   You know, I almost chipped that one in there on 8.   That would have been nice.   It sure looked good for a long time, but it was a great up‑and‑down there on 7 from about 65 yards after hitting it in the trees.   I don't think I've hit it in those trees once this whole year playing here, and somehow I managed to today.   So that's tournament golf, and hopefully I get a little more out of it tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Vegas area got a lot of rain in the August season.   How are the greens holding up?  
RYAN MOORE:   You know, if you would have seen them four or five weeks ago, you wouldn't believe how good they are right now.   They've really had some unfortunate timing, you know, kind of when they punched and sanded, and they've done an amazing job to get them back to the shape they're in, and I think they're rolling great.   They're very true greens, and if you hit a putt on line, it's going to go in.
