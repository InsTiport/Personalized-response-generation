 Q. 5-under through two rounds, talk about your position going into the weekend. Obviously a good place to be. 
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah, it was just a solid day. I was really happy with the way I started today making a few birdies there early, so that was nice. From that point I kind of cruised, a little bit of scrambling coming in just to keep it where I got it to. But it was a tough day out there, and I can't imagine it's going to get much easier.

 Q. Talk about with the potential of some weather coming in and with the weather getting worse this afternoon, your position, safely in the clubhouse going into the weekend. 
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah, I'm happy to be done right now, that's for sure. Like I said, it's not going to get any easier. The wind is starting to pick up, and it was swirling really our last eight or nine holes. It was swirling a lot. It fooled me a few times. 
 It's going to be tough, and I'm happy to be done at this point.
