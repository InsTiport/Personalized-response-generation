 Q. Solid 4-under par 67 out there, 6-under par total. Good shape going into the weekend. 
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah, definitely. I like where I'm at. It was just two solid rounds of golf. I kind of got it going. I think I birdied about four out of five there in a nine-hole stretch my first time on the back side, and kept a little momentum to the front. It was just one of those days where it was nothing too flashy, just kind of got it in the hole.

 Q. I was out there yesterday afternoon following some groups, and the greens looked pretty firm and the putts seemed to be rolling out. Any difference this morning?
 RYAN MOORE: No, they were extremely firm for the first tee time of the day out there at 7:40. I figured there might be a little moisture on them even then, but they were still bounding with sand wedges. The course is in great shape. I think it's the best I've ever seen it. It's nice having those good, firm greens. You've got to hit good shots all the way around. It's one of those golf courses. With the greens like this, it just maximizes that. 

 Q. Well, you're going sans logo, no logos, on the hat, shirt, you've got a kelly green and blue bag. How did you pick the kelly green and blue bag?
 RYAN MOORE: You know, I have no idea. It was just kind of random. Now that I think about it, it's kind of Seahawks colors, and I'm from the Seattle area. I was sorting through, I looked at what they had available, and I kind of liked that one. It might change shortly, we'll see.

 Q. How do you feel going into the weekend?
 RYAN MOORE: I feel good. I feel a lot better. Got a little rust off last week, had a few good rounds, one bad one, and now I've got good positive momentum going.
