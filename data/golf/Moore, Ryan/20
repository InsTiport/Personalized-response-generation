 Q.  Just talk a little bit about the match today.  You made a game of it there at the end?  
RYAN MOORE: We obviously got down early.  We constantly were hitting putts that we both thought were doing to go in and they didn't.   
Towards the end we were like let's make them work for this.  Let's try to get back one hole at a time.  Fortunately, I hit a couple great putts that snuck in there and made it interesting.   
 Q.  Talk about the experience as a whole your first Ryder Cup.  
RYAN MOORE: It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable out there playing today.  Definitely the most nervous I think I've ever been on the first tee.  It was fun.  It's a fun atmosphere, fun environment to play in.  It makes you want to step up and make those putts.  Fortunately I was able to make a couple to extend the match today.   
 Q.  I know it's not the afternoon the Americans wanted but still going in with the lead on the second day?  
RYAN MOORE: Exactly.  A lead is a lead.  That's where you want to be.  You want to be on the right side of it.  We keep ourselves on the right side of it all week, we'll be in good shape.
