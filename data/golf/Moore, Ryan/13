Q. Tell me about the match.
RYAN MOORE: I mean, it was not that pretty.  It wasn't really great golf on either side of it.  He hit some bad shots, I hit some bad shots.  We both made a few birdies.  It was kind of scrappy.  I guess it was a fitting end.  I don't think either one of us played particularly well.  I guess to halve the match in the end is kind of fitting.
Q. Jordan Spieth lost today.  Do you feel he's going to be tough opponent later this week?
RYAN MOORE: Obviously.  He's one of best golfers in the world.  Home area advantage, if you will.  Any time you have to play against someone of his caliber, it's tough.  It will be tough.
