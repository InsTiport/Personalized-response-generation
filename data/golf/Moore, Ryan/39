Q. I'm going to ask you a question I'm assuming you would be asked:  Talk about your 1 on the card today.
RYAN MOORE: I mean, it was great.  It was a tough little hole location there today on 16, and man, of all the shots, I honestly didn't think that one had much of a chance.  It landed in the rough and got a great kick.  I couldn't see it, you were kind of blind from up there, but we had a good crowd around there that all kind of jumped in the air and went in.  It was fun.  Every time that happens -- doesn't happen to us very often, so any time it happens, it's kind of like the first time type thing.
Q. As you may be aware, Quicken Loans, they give a mortgage to one of the fans for every hole-in-one made on TOUR.  Just talk about that and your part in that and making a fan's day.
RYAN MOORE: I think that's awesome.  When that came out a year or two ago, I thought that was a really cool thing to do, and to keep some intrigue every week on the course and on par 3s and keep people watching.  It's really cool.  It's really cool that someone gets their mortgage paid.  I'm just glad I could help out.
