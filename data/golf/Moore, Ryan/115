 Q. Obviously convincing 5 and 4 today over K.J. Just some keys to the round, how you're feeling going into tomorrow?
 RYAN MOORE: I just played steady golf again today, just kind of like I did yesterday. It was nothing crazy, birdied the holes I should have. And didn't make too many mistakes out there. I just played a good, solid round. And he gave me a couple of holes and ended up with a good comfortable lead.

 Q. Any stand-out shots or holes that you're particularly proud of?
 RYAN MOORE: Hit a couple of great shots on the par-5, going -- the second one on the back nine. Was that 13? A great shot into there. I kind of needed to kind of get it done and hit a great 5-wood in there from about 270 to give myself a really good eagle opportunity and it went in the hole.
