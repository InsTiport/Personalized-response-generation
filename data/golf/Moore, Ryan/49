 Q.   Beginning of the final round, it was a rollercoaster for a lot of you guys out here.   What was your assessment of how it played out?  
RYAN MOORE:   It was a tough day out there.   For me, just the putter was ice cold today.   I had plenty of opportunities.   I hit some great shots.   You know, I had a lot of good chances, I just didn't capitalize on them and kind of ran out of steam.  
   
 Q.   What's the most frustrating part, the slow start, you lose the lead, hole out on 6.   Seemed like it was very tough keeping momentum going.  
RYAN MOORE:   That's what a tough golf course will do to you.   Every shot mattered.   You got to put it in the fairway and on the green.   If not, you have tough shots and tough up and downs.   
You know, I did -- the tough part of it I did well today of hitting fairways and greens.   I just didn't convert.   Lot of great birdie chances that I didn't make.   In the end that's what you got to do to win a golf tournament.  
   
 Q.   What are the positives you take away from the week?  
RYAN MOORE:   Again, I played good, solid golf really two weeks in a row down here in Florida.   It was great for me.   I got a little break after this and kind of get ready for Augusta.
