Q. Ryan, another really solid round of golf under windy conditions.
RYAN MOORE: Yeah.  The last two days have been almost identical, the same really blustery winds, very up and down and at least kind of the same direction both days so you could kind of get used to it because of that, but this much wind with this type of golf course with narrow fairways, smaller greens, it's difficult to score.
Q. Whenever I think windy conditions, I think of ball-striking and patience.  How were you in both categories?
RYAN MOORE: I'd say the ball striking was, okay, the last couple days.  I definitely scrambled really well yesterday but I missed it in a lot of really good spots yesterday.  I didn't hit a ton of greens.  My misses were really reasonable from putting from the fringe or from the first cut.
Yeah, a big key is patience and just not trying to, you know, force your will on this golf course, especially in these types of conditions you kind of just got to let it dictate a little bit of what you can do and take what it gives you and keep moving.
Q. Everyone is kind of learning these new greens.  Have they changed in speed overnight at all?
RYAN MOORE: No.  I mean they got pretty baked out yesterday afternoon with the wind and pretty exposed from the sun.  Today they have a little cloud cover.  Might keep a little bit of moisture in them.
This morning they were a little bit slower than what we faced yesterday afternoon because it was early in the morning and with the moisture and everything like that.  They'll speed up and I'd say they've been pretty consistent, though, the last two days.
Q. See you in the 3rd Round.
RYAN MOORE: Okay.  Thank you.
