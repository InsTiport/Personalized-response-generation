 Q. I know a tough day for you out there. Just comment on the round. 
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah, it was all putting. That was the difference between yesterday and today. I hit five or six putts that could have just easily gone in, and they just wouldn't go in. I felt like there was a goalie in front of the hole today for me. I don't know why, they just weren't going in.

 Q. You've got two rounds to go and you're still in good shape. 
 RYAN MOORE: Yeah, pretty frustrating, made double there late in the round, just sloppy, just made a mess of the hole. I finally made my only birdie of the day here on the last hole, so at least have a little positive note, made a decent putt, and I'm not out of it by any means. The golf course is not playing easy and scores aren't going crazy low, so kind of anybody probably even 1-over or better probably has a pretty good chance on the weekend.
