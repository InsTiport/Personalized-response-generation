Q.  How do you feel you played today?
 
JOSE MARIA CANIZARES:  I hit the ball very good.  I missed some drives.  (inaudible) My putting sometimes is coming good, sometimes coming bad.  The wind here is very bad. (inaudible). 
 

Q.  What do you think is going to take to win this?
 
JOSE MARIA CANIZARES:  I don't know, windy like that maybe, no, 6-, 8-under par if the wind is like that.  Maybe the wind is not windy, maybe 10 to 12, I don't know.  It is difficult to say because that course is very tough. 
 

Q.  You've never been to Iowa before.  When you found out it was going to be here, did you have any idea of the crowd?
 
JOSE MARIA CANIZARES:  It is nice.  Super.  This is my first time in any tournaments I play in my life, first time I see a lot of people.  It is very nice.  It is incredible.  (inaudible) very nice for the pros, very nice for the organization, very nice for everybody, also nice for the golf.  (inaudible) it surprised me a lot. 
 

Q.  No. 5 was the par 4; a lot of people thought it should have been a par 5 yet you turned around you got a birdie?
 
JOSE MARIA CANIZARES:  I hit a very good drive and very nice 7-iron and make very nice putt.  Very difficult hole.  I like it. 
 

Q.  Your impressions of the greens.
 
JOSE MARIA CANIZARES:  The greens is nice.  (inaudible) some greens some people.  It is fast but not too much fast.  You look at that greens, it is too much move.  It is nice greens. That is because the course is so difficult also anytime it is difficult the greens are difficult.
