JOSE MARIA CANIZARES:  No, today I missed No. 17.  I started chipping very badly.  I made the putt for par.
I played steady.  My putting today is very good.  I am putting very nice.  It's okay.  I'm happy.
Q.  (Inaudible.)

JOSE MARIA CANIZARES:   Yes, I love that course.  Because that course --  I can hit a good driving shot and have very good putting.  Also the chipping, when you hit a good shot, and miss the green, the chipping is difficult.  I like it, because my feeling -- the chipping is good. 
Q.  (Inaudible.)

JOSE MARIA CANIZARES:  What club?  I made a birdie -- where was my first birdie?  I made a birdie on No. 3.  I hit a driver, 1-iron and two good putts.

And then, the second nine, I made birdie on the 12, the 12 is par-3.  I hit a 6-iron, and the putt maybe six yards.

No. 14, I hit a sand wedge, maybe 3 yards, two and a half.

Then, I made one on 16.  I hit a driver, 8-iron, maybe six yards and made it.  That's all.  Thank you.
