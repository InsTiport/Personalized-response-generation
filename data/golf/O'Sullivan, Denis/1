 Q. How are the greens playing today?
 DENIS O'SULLIVAN: Too fast. Much too fast for me. They're wonderful. The place is absolutely fantastic. But I'm not used to speed like this. Never. In Europe we don't get that kind of speed. So it's a bit tricky. But it's awesome.

 Q. You did birdie on 15. 
 DENIS O'SULLIVAN: Yeah. That's awesome. 

 Q. Back to back fives there. 
 DENIS O'SULLIVAN: I had a rough day out there. No, I just didn't hit it good. I come off a couple weeks of back trouble. Really I'm not a hundred percent really. My back's not great. But that's no excuse, I just didn't hit it good enough out there. And if you don't hit it in the fairway, it's dead. I hit it on four into the rough and I had four hacks out of the rough before I could get it out. So, not the thing to do. 

 Q. Change of game plan for tomorrow?
 DENIS O'SULLIVAN: Just play better. That's all. Hit it on the fairway. Hit it on the green out there. It's such a tough golf course. And the scoring is, 66s? Not even in my dreams.
