  Q. Victor, can you walk me through the round today.
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, obviously got off to a great start, birdied the first three holes and was up in the match early and gave a little bit away, missed about the same putt he had on 5 to lose the hole.  He birdied 7, obviously came back, gave me 8 with a poor tee shot.  I felt like I was in control of the match after I birdied 10, and really that gift 12, he birdied 13.  So it's been a little bit of a double swing; it was 3-up, back to one, back to three, back to one, and just able to handle the last four or five holes well and was enough to win.
 Q. When you walked by here the other day and Antoine was talking to you as you gave him a fist pump, did that motivate you, the way he played on that first day?
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, obviously it was great.  I think he had nothing to lose.  He was playing against Bryson, who's definitely been playing extremely well lately with the win at Bay Hill and had some great results, and he had nothing to lose and gave it all and actually was able to complete and win the day, which as I was walking by was like, well, that's great, that gave me some motivation to play strong on the back side.
