Q. Commiserations, but a great week, as well.
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, obviously very pleased. I think if somebody would have told me at the start of the day I would have been into a playoff, would I have been delighted just to get into a playoff so very pleased with the event.
Showed some form again on a tough -- scorable, but still difficult course and it's going to be a good preparation next week before Dubai.
Q. A bit unlucky on the draw and spent a bit of time on the 18 tee. What were you thinking?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, you try to make the best out of what you got. That's all you can really do. There's good breaks, bad breaks. You know, at the end of the day, if I hit my drive into the fairway and hit my shot into the green, I can win 3 and make the tournament or make 4 and keep on going. It is what it is. There's no good luck, bad luck, I wish, I would have kind of thing.
You just kind of take it with what you got, and you know over the course of a season, a career, things are going to even themselves out. I'm not concerned about whether I wish I would have gone first or be in the last group. It makes no difference to me.
