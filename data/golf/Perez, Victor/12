Q. You've made incredible strides this weekend, today alone out in 33 coming back in 30 for an incredible 63. What was the difference?
VICTOR PEREZ: Really hard to tell. It was one of those things, you just play and you kind of get in the flow of the round, and obviously I felt like I needed to have a good round. I felt like I was well-rested starting the first tournament of the year.
I felt like I had a really good off-season preparing for the upcoming 2020 season, and obviously very pleased to be able to hold a fourth round on the first event of the year. It's one of those things, I started to make a few putts. I feel like I putted very well this week, which is always needed for this kind of performance and obviously delighted.
Q. I think you had a well-needed break, as well, because after that incredible win, Alfred Dunhill Links, you went on to make some incredible results at the WGC and some Rolex Series. What have those results done for your confidence?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, obviously a lot of confidence from these tournaments. Just thrive on these moments. I think you take a lot from it, and you try to take all the positives.
I think it shows you that you can do it at that level, and then obviously you come into these types of tournaments feeling a lot more comfortable compared to 12 months ago when this was my second Rolex Series Event. So obviously it's a lot different than it was 1 months ago. It shows how quickly things can go in this game and obviously I'm going to try to keep on going.
Q. This time last year when you walked off the course in Abu Dhabi, you were 13th in the world and today you stand in the Top-50. What a difference a year makes?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, it shows everyone that it's doable and that I can get better. You see guys playing really well, but it's about me to continue getting better.
Obviously I'm very pleased with where I am, but I think it's a continuous process, and you always try to learn. This year is going to be brand new again for me like last year was, being my first year on The European Tour last year, and this year I'm going to be getting in some majors. So obviously this will be all new, so it's learning, and that's the great thing about golf, you always learn, good or bad, really.
