Q. A 64 to open your Dunhill Links Championship. How pleased are you with that performance?
VICTOR PEREZ: Very pleased. Conditions could have gone either way today with the rain and we got a way with very slight wind and very good weather. I felt like the greens were receptive and a lot of scoring opportunities out there, and I took advantage for sure, which was nice.
Q. Now as a Frenchman, people think it's goodies getting used to links golf, but you know a thing or two about this place. Tell everyone about your history here and where you live for starters?
VICTOR PEREZ: I do live in Dundee. My girlfriend lives here. She goes to dental school here. I've lived here for the last year and a half.
Obviously being around and playing links all the time when I'm not in tournaments definitely makes a big difference. It's just being used to the bounce and used to the greens. I think a lot of the guys struggle with the greens being slow, and for me, it's just a normal pace that I'm comfortable, and the chipping. And I think everything around -- I don't think you can play enough links golf, and it definitely played to my advantage today for sure.
