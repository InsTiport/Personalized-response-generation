  Q. 3-under par today, excellent start.  If we can get some comments on your round.
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, obviously very pleased with the way I handled things on the back side.  I think I started -- it was quite to cold this morning, first off, struggled a little bit on the front, bogeyed 18 and 1.  And, yeah, good birdie on 3 and then the round kind of like came a little bit together and really happy with the little bonus birdie, 8, 9 to finish.
 Q. Talk about that last seven hole-stretch, just how much you had it rolling there?
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, obviously it's, it shows you golf is a funny game, you're never as far as you think you are and it's just a little bit about the mindset, bringing some positivity, it just takes a couple good shots to hit and then you kind of feel like you find your flow.
 Q. Talk about the golf course today, the conditions out there this morning early.  How was it?
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, it was obviously a little wet this morning early, which made it play quite long.  I think I was fortunate to tee off 10, which I think the guys teeing off 1, 2, 3 could have had longer holes.  I think 10 kind of gives you a little bit of a chance.  11 is not overly long.  So that was a bit of fortunate to tee off on that side being a little humid, a little cold.
 But, yeah, I think it's going to dry up, the wind's up a little bit, so it should be interesting for the guys this afternoon for the rest of the week.
