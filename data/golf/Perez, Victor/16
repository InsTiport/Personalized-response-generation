 Q.  Second consecutive 65 for 10-under and the clubhouse lead. How would you reflect on the round?  
VICTOR PEREZ: Obviously very please the with the second round. I think it was important to keep the ham   
 Q.  Second consecutive 65 for 10-under and the clubhouse lead. How would you reflect on the round?  
VICTOR PEREZ: Obviously very please the with the second round. I think it was important to keep the hammer down after obviously an expected 65 in the wind yesterday. I think they were definitely the tougher conditions, and it's one of those days where you hope to stay a couple under.   
And I was able to play really well yesterday, and obviously coming out this morning, this is the round where you have to try to take as much advantage as you can and put some points on the board, and obviously in a very good position for tomorrow.   
 Q.  How difficult is it to back up another good round like yesterday?  
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, it's obviously difficult because you feel like you're playing well and you want obviously things to work, but. I was able to make some birdies early which got me going, and then you feel like it kind of frees up a little bit. You see that you're ahead, and you just want to try to increase the lead.   
 Q.  What has pleased you most about your play so far here in Saudi Arabia?  
VICTOR PEREZ: I feel like I've been able to hole some good putts. I feel like that's everybody's -- when they are playing well, generally the guys that are up at the top of the leaderboard are generally putting really well.   
I feel like I've been able to hole some key putts, and it also frees you up. You don't feel like you have to hit the ball really stiff and you feel like you're taking advantage of your opportunities, and that's what I've done really well so far.   
 Q.  Following the bogeys on the front nine, your back nine, talk us through the ninth hole, birdie?  
VICTOR PEREZ: Obviously the wind coming off the left a little bit, really warm. I feel like we've taken ten degrees in the last hour or so, and I was trying to hit a little off the left side of the bunker and the ball never really turned. I pulled it a little bit and I got fortunate to end up where I ended up. It could have been in the rough and then it would have been more -- but playing the middle of the green, I was in the sand and I was able to take ball first and give myself a good look and obviously very, very good to finish with a birdie.   
 Q.  How confident do you feel now on The European Tour in your brief career, with the success last year and the good finish in Abu Dhabi?  
VICTOR PEREZ: Obviously I feel like I'm getting more confident and it's about getting reps. You see Lee Westwood winning in Abu Dhabi; he's been winning for so long, he knows his way around and what to do. He has a very clear idea of what he need to do out there, and I'm getting more comfortable out there. It's just about putting yourself in contention as much as possible and then you see how you play.
