Q. 71. Three birdies and an eagle. Tell us about it.
VICTOR PEREZ: Obviously conditions were quite difficult. The pins might have been just a bit more tucked, for me, at least. I felt the course played a little bit tougher today but definitely pleased with a round under par.
Q. Talk about the conditions.
VICTOR PEREZ: Up 9, for example, I hit a great driver, great 7-iron to six, seven feet. Missed the putt for birdie, but the hole felt really easy. But the moment you're out of position, it's going to be a grind just to make par.
Like I was saying yesterday, it's kind of do-or-die on each hole where it can play quite easy. I made an eagle, some birdies, but you get out of position, now you are to figure out how to make 4.
Q. Really good representation of The Challenge Tour boys.
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, I think it's good, some of us here graduating from The Challenge Tour last year. I got to know Bob over the course of The Challenge Tour and this year, and it's been a lot of fun to battle it out.
I grew up in France, played college in New Mexico, and really enjoyed my time there and now living in Scotland, which has been good for my golf, I would say.
