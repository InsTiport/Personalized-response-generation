Q. Your thoughts, first time?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, it was a great day for me. Very pleased with how I played. I think I did a lot of things well today and I'm obviously in a great position after day one.
Q. So when you came in here, you had a little bit of momentum, so you come in with some confidence, don't you?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, obviously at the end of the year has been quite well since the win at Dunhill. A couple of good weeks in Italy and France. Obviously it can always be better, but after win, you could go either way. You could really ride it or have a little bit of a downfall from it.
I did well, coming in here with a lot of confidence and the course suits me fairly well. It's long. The greens are going to be firm this week and obviously having JP helped a lot, as well today.
Q. Tell us about the process of going around this golf course because it looks like it's perfect conditions, but still tricky, isn't it?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, for sure. It can go both ways, which is why we see some great scores and some guys struggling. I just feel like if you're in the fairway, you can be aggressive. The pins are gettable today and the greens are absolutely perfect, so you can roll some putts. But the moment you get out of position now, you're going to have to try to find a side where you can get up-and-down, and if it happens to be a day where the 6- , 7-footers are not going in, you can really pile up some bogeys out there. It can go either way, which is great, because a very low one is doable like we've seen with the other guys, as well.
Q. As a professional golfer, you enjoy these moments?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, just to be here, it's my first WGC, very excited just to start with. I think being around here and going down the fairway with some of the best players in the world, being that first year on Tour is quite amazing. It's really enjoyable. Obviously you just try to make the most out of it, as well.
