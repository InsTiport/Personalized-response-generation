 JOHN DEVER:   Good afternoon.  Welcome back to the 2020 PGA Championship at TPC Harding Park.  We're again joined by Victor Perez, closing round 68, 4-under par at this time.
 Q. I was just curious, very few complaints about the golf course.  For a long time, people around here never thought Harding could hold a major, and yet it's been very successful it would seem.  I wonder, if so, what did you like about the golf course and did it meet major standards for you, and do you feel like it was a successful week?
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, I mean, of course for me I think it was my first major, so I don't have a lot of experience compared to some of the other guys that could be able to compare, I think.
 I think in a sense the no fans made it a little bit trickier because some of the rough on the outside of the fairways would have been patted down from the people, so I think in a sense that helped.
 But yeah, the course was challenging, the course was long, firm, with some rough, challenging, kind of have to stay patient.  The leading score right now is about 10-under par, which is kind of what it's supposed to be, if the conditions didn't get too crazy.  It was windy but never really got out of control.  The greens were fast but again didn't get out of control.  So I think it was right on point and I think the organization did a really good job setting up the course.  It was really fair this week I thought.
