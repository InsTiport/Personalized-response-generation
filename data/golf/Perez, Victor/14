Q. 66. How satisfying is that for you?
VICTOR PEREZ: Obviously very pleased on Saturday. I think the pins were a bit trickier today and I needed to putt a good number to get back in the mix because there's so many guys. Starting in 25th place, there's too many guys in front of you, and guys are going to keep shooting low numbers. To get some sort of hope for tomorrow I needed to get something in the mid 60s for sure.
Q. Since you had the great win at the Alfred Dunhill Links, do you look at yourself and see yourself as a different player?
VICTOR PEREZ: Not necessarily. Every week is different. It was great for me to win in my first year obviously but every week is different. You have to reset what you're doing, and take it one week at time a time really.
Q. You're a guy who has not played with a glove. Has it always been like that?
VICTOR PEREZ: No, it hasn't. I grew up playing with a glove. I played for quite some time, but I'm lefty playing righty. Actually I got the question asked yesterday. It started as a drill and then I built into my game as I felt more comfortable doing it that way.
Q. When you're at home in Dundee, you've got to wear two gloves.
VICTOR PEREZ: At times. But usually when you have to wear two gloves, you're not even on the golf course, anyway.
Q. So what are your plans for tonight?
VICTOR PEREZ: Obviously a lot of rest. It's quite warm here. Coming from the WGC last week, the travel has been quite exhausting, so a lot of resting and a big day tomorrow to keep climbing the board.
Q. And your confidence levels?
VICTOR PEREZ: Quite high. The course is right there in front of you. The good shots are rewarded and it's a matter of making birdies, really.
