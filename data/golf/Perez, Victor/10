  VICTOR PEREZ: Obviously very happy with my play over the first couple of days. Obviously yesterday I think it was good to get off. For a while we thought maybe we weren't going to play at all. It was good to get some holes in, and we got to 7. We were last off, and obviously a long day today, but very pleased with the performance so far.   
   
 Q. Was it exactly as you expected or any surprises, anything different?   
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, I think obviously it's different than expected from the Bermuda. It's still a little bit in the grass, makes everything play I think a little bit longer, not get that much run, so the course I think plays long, but the organization have done really well moving some of the tees up and not making it crazy long. I think it's fair and it puts everybody in a position to where if they hit good shots, they can score.   
   
 Q. First Masters, first cut made, how satisfied are you?   
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, obviously very pleased. I mean, the first goal was obviously to do that, and I wish I would have made a few more putts leading up to the weekend. I'm going to have a few shots back I would say to the lead and the top 10 I would say, but the key for me will be the greens. If I can find my pace, I think reads were okay but the pace was off. I left a lot of putts short, which obviously makes a scorecard with a lot of pars.
