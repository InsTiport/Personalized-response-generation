VICTOR PEREZ: It feels so fresh, just finished, amazing day, very stressful. Didn't get much sleep last night and wasn't really hungry either. It was just a battle out there with Matt. Hats off to him. He gave me a hell of a fight out there and I felt like it could have gone either way. I was fortunate it was my time today.
Q. Do you think you spurred each other on out there on the course?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, I felt like up until the turn, it was pretty open. I felt like anybody from the groups ahead could have make a run and thankfully they didn't and it ended up being a one-to-one battle with Matt going into the last four or five five holes. The switch was really the birdie on 14, I felt like I came back in the game and I held strong for the last four.
Q. Overall a great week, how have you enjoyed the unique format?
VICTOR PEREZ: We did a little bit of that on The Challenge Tour with the Rolex Trophy, but this is completely different, playing three courses, Kingsbarns, Carnoustie and two rounds here makes it incredibly special.
The format is awesome. I think it's a chance for the amateurs to see from inside the ropes and connect with the players, which is something that they strive and they love to do and chat with us and ask what clubs we hit and why and all these kind of questions. I think it's really cool that we can give back those people, as well.
Q. Does this give you tremendous confidence moving on to the next tournament?
VICTOR PEREZ: Yeah, obviously there's nothing like a win. The confidence that you get from getting it done, it's so difficult at this level to win. Being my first year, I'm obviously delighted.
