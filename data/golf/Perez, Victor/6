  Q. How would you assess your match today?
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, obviously very happy, tough customer.  I knew he wasn't going to let me have any shots really and he didn't.  It really came down to executing down the stretch.  Felt like -- he hit the ball in the water on 12, which was a little bit unlucky.  It lands on the green, had a little bit too much draw spin and that kind of gave me a bit the opening.  And then he bogeyed the next hole, which was a bit of the momentum, and I was able to hold on until the end.
 Q. You're obviously high up on the points list for the European Ryder Cup team.  How much do you feel like this is maybe a little bit of kind of showing Padraig Harrington what you can do in match play?
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, I guess.  You can see it whichever way you want.  Obviously I was just trying to focus on my match and trying to get the job done for the day and again tomorrow, and if I play to my game, then the chips will fall where they're supposed to.  I think you can overthink this thing a little bit too much and go, Oh, I hope he sees or whatever, but I think it's just about playing good golf and whatever needs to happen will happen.
 Q. How do you feel like you are as a match play player?
 VICTOR PEREZ:   To me match play is just like playing on Sunday.  It's pretty much right in front of you.  You know what to do, which gives you clarity.  You don't have to think, oh, maybe the guy in front is making a run or the guy behind -- it's right there in front of you.  I think it's pretty evident what you need to do.  I think it gives you clarity in your mind to know that you just have to execute shots.
 Q. Are you becoming more comfortable in these bigger events on the world stage?
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, I mean, I feel like everything takes a little bit of time, a little bit of experience.  I think there's guys like Collin Morikawa who comes out and wins the PGA and wins WGCs, but they're outliers.  Everybody has to go at their own pace and whatever they feel comfortable, and yeah, I obviously feel better as I'm doing more, and I hope it keep continuing on that edge.
 Q. Just talk about the driver off the deck on 16 there.  Obviously a pretty cool reaction after the result.
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, I felt like I hit it in practice and I had a pretty good visual what I need to do.  There's a little ShotLink like triangle on the back left of the green, which is pretty much where I was trying to aim and hit, and it's a shot that the 3-wood needed to be perfect probably to get there but the false front wasn't going to leave the easiest chip.  I knew with driver I had a chance to get it past the hole, which was probably the best spot to be.  Just a matter of putting a good swing and ended up in a great spot.
