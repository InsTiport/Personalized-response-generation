  Q. A well-played match.  How about you taking the last two holes, a beautiful birdie at the 16th; at worst you're into a playoff, at best you're into the round of 16.  You have to be happy with yourself.
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, obviously very happy, but kind of half and half at the moment because the job is not done yet.  Obviously we have to wait to see what Marc and Russell are doing at the back, and we'll see what happens.  But obviously very pleased.  Step one was to win my match, and I did that.
 Q. Coming over here and being able to win, you've got to have a lot of confidence.
 VICTOR PEREZ:   Yeah, obviously very happy with today.  Sungjae is a great player.  He's shown that the last couple years, obviously winning on the PGA TOUR and having some great results and finishing second at the Masters.  Obviously he's been upcoming and playing really well.  I knew it was going to be a tough match.
 I got off to a great start, gave a few away, got back into it, gave a few away and got a little tight towards the end, but really happy with how I finished 16 and 17.
