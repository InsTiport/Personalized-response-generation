 Q.   73, 69, what did you do differently?  
LYDIA KO:   I holed many for putts.   I had two 3‑putts and I thought, maybe another day like I did yesterday, but I felt, okay, par 5, next hole, let's get it done and two birdies in a row coming after two bogeys, so okay, start again, make some more birdies, and did not make anymore bogeys after the two.   I tried to play as consistent as possible and I'm pretty happy.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel about form coming into this tournament?   
LYDIA KO:   I played really good golf in Australia and then I played well last week, so I just wanted to keep that same form up to this week, obviously the world's best players are out here playing, so you kind of have to give it all you've got and yeah, that's what I tried to do.  
   
 Q.   Is there anyone we should watch out for?   
LYDIA KO:   The top players are out here.   Anna played great last week and she seems like she's playing well today again and so are the others.   So I can't really eliminate one, but like I said, the world's best players are out here and you've just got to try your best.   
   
 Q.   Have you seen any of Singapore?   You got here on Sunday‑‑ have you seen any of the city yet?   
LYDIA KO:   Not really.   I came here a couple years ago with the Singapore Flyers and I could see a lot of the city.   It's beautiful and a lot to do and a lot of shopping, as well.   Yeah, I've been enjoying it so far.  
   
 Q.   So getting on to the weekend, can we expect anything‑‑  
LYDIA KO:   I think if I shoot the scores I did today, I think that will be pretty good, and, you know, it will keep me up there, may not get me to win, but I'm still up there.
