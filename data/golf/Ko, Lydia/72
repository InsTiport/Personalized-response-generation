Q. Good round today.  Good position.  How are you feeling as this tournament gets started?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I holed some really good putts on my back nine, which I think was the key for today's round.
I would say I didn't hit the ball fantastic, but just being able to hole some good birdie putts was key.
Just to be able to finish under par after an average front nine was a good turnaround.
Q. I believe you've won this tournament in the past.  Is there something about this course that fits your playing style?
LYDIA KO: I think this is a pretty tough golf course.  I think putting is a huge key around this course where if you do miss a green, making those clutch par putts and then making those birdie opportunities that you get.
I mean, I love the Carlsbad area, so it's always nice to come back to a city that you really like playing and like exploring.
Q. That was your first time at a baseball stadium at Petco.  Would you like to go back to watch a game?  You said maybe the Dodgers, huh?
LYDIA KO: Well, I've never been to baseball games.  I would love to go to any one.
I think it would be very cool.  Very different to just watching it on TV.  I would love to go there.  It was a really cool stadium, so hopefully I get a chance to go and watch a game sometime down the road.
Q. What do you think is the key moving forward?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, we still got few days to go, so just gotta be aggressive and be confident with each shot I have.  Stay patient at times.
Yeah, all I can do is try my best.  Hopefully I'll be able to keep this good momentum going.
