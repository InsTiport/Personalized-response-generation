Q. 6-under par today.  Thoughts on your round, please.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I played really solid.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities for birdies, and there was a string there that I felt like I should have made birdies that I didn't.
But, yeah, making that up and down on that last hole was definitely good.  I think I'm one shot behind now, but it's -- I tried my best out there.  We'll just have to go from there.
Q. Second round proved costly; shot a 73.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, that was just not good.  Not good.  My ball striking wasn't very good and my putting wasn't very good.  Combination of those two and you're not going to play a very good round.
Luckily, even though I shot 73, I didn't end up going that far back on the leaderboard.  I was able to have a decent round yesterday to put myself there.
Yeah, no, it's a waiting game now.  I knew I needed to have a low one today.  That's what I was able to do, so it's out of my hands.
Q. Do you see yourself getting back to world No. 1?
LYDIA KO: I would obviously love to be back there.  You know, but to me, I'm not really thinking about my rankings.  I don't even know what it is right now.  I'm just going out there and trying to play the best I can and making myself more opportunities to be in contention, be at the top of the leaderboard.
That's all you can do.  Sometimes you get too carried away about the awards and rankings.  It just becomes so much.  To me, I think it's more important to keep putting myself there and putting myself in those -- shooting in the 60s, and that way I think it builds the confidence and the rankings kind of sort itself out.
Q. This course has been rebuilt.  What did you think of this course and the challenge it presents?
LYDIA KO: I think it's a pretty tough golf course.  There is a few holes there, like the last today, if you're coming off par on that hole you're doing really well.
But there are holes that can be a little bit more rewarding if you're a bit more aggressive.  I didn't really know what kind of golf course to expect before coming this week.  It's a really nice golf course, and obviously today playing with Shanshan was nice to be able to play in front of Shanshan's Army.  Yeah.
Q. Lydia, fantastic round of 66.  You know you are just one off the lead.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I tried my best out there.  I knew that it was pretty tough with the wind from the 1st hole.  I actually asked Jonny, Is it meant to be this windy today?  I think it was a little breezier than what it was forecasted to be, so I knew with some of pin positions it was going to be a tough day out there.
I tried to make as many birdies as I can, give myself good opportunities, and I felt like I played solid, especially down the stretch.  It's really out of my hands right now.  Yeah, it's definitely nice to be able to -- even if it finishes here, you know, finish strong for this event.
Q. Just spoke to your caddie and I said, What was the key?  He said, Actually sacking me in the weekend and not getting me to help her read putts.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, you know, I was struggling a little bit committing between -- when we were in between lines.  It's obviously my job to say, Hey, I'm going to do this, and just putt.  I was having a hard time doing that, and I said, Hey, I don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm having a hard time to commit.
It's hard enough when you're committed; when you're not committed you're just in between shots.  So I just said, Hey, today I'm going to try and read it, but if it gets difficult or iffy, I'll just call you in and maybe you can help.
It worked today.  I don't know how long this is going to go, but obviously I just tried to be -- have my 100% commitment over every shot today.
