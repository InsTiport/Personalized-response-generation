Q. Lydia Ko, 9-under in round three.  You said after your round yesterday you felt like you were close enough to maybe make a run at it.  Today you did at 9-under; 6 birdies in a row.  What happened the last six holes?
LYDIA KO: I actually hit my shots into the green really close.  I had so many great looks for birdies.  I was putting pretty well on the back nine.
I hit probably one of the worst shots of the day on 10 and then made a good up and down.
I think the big key for me was making a good par on No. 12.  I actually nearly putted off the green with my first one, but I hit it close enough where it was in some comfortable birdie ranges.  I was striking it well, so just trusted my read and put a good stroke on it.
Q. The mindset going into tomorrow knowing the scores will be low this afternoon as well?
LYDIA KO: I think I'm still going to be four or five shots behind, maybe more, at the end of the day.  I just got to focus on my game tomorrow, and hopefully I have another low one.
