 Q.  Talk a bit about your round.  
LYDIA KO: I my pull striking wasn't that if today, and I didn't have that many putts for birdie.  Probably the best iron that I hit was on the last hole.  I missed a putt there.  Just a lot wasn't clicking, so that's why I was struggling to make a lot of birdies, and I think with some of the pin positions today, it was gettable, and my ball-striking want able to match that.   
 Q.  Looking at Inbee, second tournament back, how impressive is that?  
LYDIA KO: It's really impressive.  I think if you choose a player that might do that, it's going to be Inbee.  She's one of the most consistent players out here.  I think her and Shanshan are two of the most consistent.   
Yeah, it's a very impressive round, no matter how the course is set up.  To shoot 8-under on the final day, it's not easy.  I think she should be very proud of herself for that and it was super impressive to see.   
 Q.  Do you think that what you've seen of her today, that maybe she's catching up with you?  
LYDIA KO: I think so.  Like I said earlier, she's so consistent, and even if she played a tournament every three times, she's still going to come out and do her best and probably be in contention.  She's that type of player that she just always putts herself there.   
Even Ariya, watching how she's playing, it's impressive, too.  It's a cool time for the Tour.  Like going into today, there were a lot of big names within a few shots of the lead, and they made it really cool and that's what made all the fans come out to watch.
