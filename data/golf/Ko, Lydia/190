LYDIA KO: I think just trying to keep it in the fairways.  Yesterday it was hard to keep the ball on the green.  They made the greens a little softer, but still tough with the pin positions tucked.   
 Q.  Only 18 holes to play.  What experiences will you lean on as you make your way around here on Sunday?  
LYDIA KO: Going into Evian and ANA I just had very calm thoughts, positive thoughts until the last rounds.  And then I just said hey, just go out and enjoy it.  Just don't worry about what everybody else does.  That's all I can do.  I've got to just try my best and have fun.  And I guess if I can't control what somebody else does, the most important thing is just to be focused on my game and not think about what the other players are doing.
