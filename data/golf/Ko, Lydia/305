 Q.   One week you've been No.1 in the world, and it looks like Inbee Park is taking you down.   How important is it for you to stay No.1?  
LYDIA KO:   I wasn't really thinking about it all week.   It was great to have the starter say, from New Zealand, Rolex ranking No.1, and that was really great.   I think it's only going to last for this week, but Inbee has played great and so have other girls.   All I could do the last two days was just try my best and try and shoot a good score today.  
   
 Q.   Do you look at the leaderboard and try and calculate in your head where you have to be to stay No.1?  
LYDIA KO:   I saw the news or like the projections and how it would change, but I didn't really think about it.   To me it was more important trying to make a lot of good putts and a lot of good birdies.   
   
 Q.   A very good day for you overall, do you think?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, it was kind of frustrating because all week‑‑ for the first day where it got really windy, I felt like my putting stroke was a little off, and it was a little‑‑ it wasn't stable.   But then I kind of got it rolling, and I was confident with my stroke.   And like today I had so many lip‑outs and so many that I would say, oh, it's in, and I would look up again, and it's not.   That was really frustrating.   I mean, obviously in a perfect world if I had holed a lot of them, I would have shot like 10‑under today.   I know that's not like realistic, but I was getting really frustrated because I was hitting a lot of good putts.   That's really all I can do.   But for them to not drop, that was kind of the thing that got me, I think.  
   
 Q.   I know Karen asked you about looking at projections, but did you look at the leaderboard just in terms of seeing where everybody else was going?   There was a lot of movement and it was so crowded.   Are you usually a leaderboard looker?  
LYDIA KO:   I looked this time.   No, I kind of said, okay, now just try and shoot a good score.   It wasn't my goal today, okay, let's shoot 12‑under and let's win.   That wasn't what‑‑ I said, okay, let's make a lot of good birdies.   I've been hitting the ball really well and been putting myself in good positions.   So I said, just kind of take that and hole a couple more putts.   It's so crowded up top.   I could see all the time, it's like one birdie and another girl makes birdie.   I think it's going to be a very interesting finish.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel okay with the quick turnaround this morning?   How many holes did you play?   
LYDIA KO:   This morning I had my putt on 16, and then 17 and 18.   I two‑putted on 16 for par and then made birdie, birdie.   I had a really good start to the day.   I played with Caroline and Lisa, and Caroline was putting on 16 and she made birdie, birdie, birdie, and Lisa made birdie on 18, so we were all under par with the two and a half holes we had.   
We started off well.   It was a really good group, and I think it was cool just to spend, I guess, quite a bit of time with the girls.  
   
 Q.   Can I get your schedule going forward?  
LYDIA KO:   Well, I've got Australia, Australian in two weeks, and then I'm going to play the New Zealand Open.
