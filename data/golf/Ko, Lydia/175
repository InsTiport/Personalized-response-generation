 Q.  Talk about being in this position going into Sunday.  Where is the mindset right now?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I let one -- it was a very dumb one, slip on the last hole.  But it was a pretty consistent day.  I got to finish both nines pretty strong.  I've got to take the positives.  There were so many putts that were so close but didn't end up falling, so hopefully a few more fall today.  Hyo Joo played great today, holed a lot of putts, put herself in really good positions, so yeah, obviously I'll be trying to track her down tomorrow, but there's still a lot of golf to be played.   
 Q.  How do you attack a day when you're going to be down a couple shots going in?  
LYDIA KO: You know, at the end of the day I've just got to focus on my game.  If I can put some good shots and put myself in good positions to make birdies and put good strokes on it, that's all I can do at the end.  I mean, you can see it by a few groups in front of us, there were some low scores, so it shows what can be played and what can happen around this course.   
Today was probably the best course conditions we could have, less wind than the past two days.  The temperature was a little cooler than the past few days.  I think today was a gettable day.  I don't know what it's going to be like tomorrow.  But if it stays like this to tomorrow, I'm pretty sure there could be some low ones out there.   
 Q.  Is there a number you think you need to get to?  
LYDIA KO: No, I know that Hyo Joo is a pretty steady player, so I'm sure she's going to make her fair share of birdies, so at the end of the day I need to make a few more than her.  But anything can happen.  You know, No. 9 they put the tee forward today.  I don't know if they're going to do it tomorrow.  It played so different depending on where they put the pins and where they put the tees.  It just all depends on that, and if it is a little calmer, then 17 and 18 is definitely two big birdie holes.   
Yeah, I don't really know a number, but I know that coming from behind, the girls behind me definitely need to have a pretty low one to catch Hyo Joo.   
 Q.  At the end of 7, 8, 9, both you guys three birdies in a row.  At that point were you kind of just one-upping each other?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, Hyo Joo made her birdie first on 7, and then I made another good birdie there, and then Hyo Joo hit it to like three feet on 8, and then I hit it maybe like an inch or two closer, and then on 9 she made a great up-and-down from below the green, and I was probably in the easiest place with missing the green.  But it was going good, and if you can take advantage of the holes that are gettable and you can get the birdies, I think that's where you need to be.  I mean, especially from coming from behind, if you're not making the birdies where the majority of the field is, it makes it tougher to try and catch up and shoot a low number.
