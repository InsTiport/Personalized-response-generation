Q. 4-under today for an 11-under total.  You must be delighted with that.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I played really solid on the weekend.  I felt like I could have gone a little lower.  Like all day today there were some putts that I just left in the jaw.  If I hit it a little harder it would be in.
I think whatever score you shoot, no matter what you shoot, there is always something you feel you can improve on.  A big improvement from my week in Australia, so I'm proud of that.
I'm actually proud that I survived this heat and the long day yesterday.
Q. Australia last week; Singapore next week.  Do you feel like you're building up some momentum?
LYDIA KO: I hope so.  I mean, even last week I felt like there were a lot of positives to take from.  That's what I try to think coming into this week.  Obviously nice to be back here in Thailand after not having played this event for a few years.
Q. Hot week.  How are you going to reward yourself now?
LYDIA KO: A shower, cold shower.  Like I told him, I smell.  I think a shower is really long overdue.
