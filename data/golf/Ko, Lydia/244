 Q.  Not exactly the finish you wanted, but you actually had one shot at the end to get in a playoff.  Overall, how would you assess the week?  
LYDIA KO: I played pretty solidly.  I just didn't play well from 6 to 11.  But I'm a little disappointed more that I left my two putts short on 15, 14, where I think if I just hit it a little bit harder, it would have dropped.  But I played solid.   
And obviously coming into the week, I said one of my big goals is to have a better result than last year.  That's done, but Lexi played great.  It's hard to play awesome on the final day.  I was struggling in the middle of my round, but to know that I was maybe able to turn it around a little bit in the end, I think that's a good sign.   
 Q.  What do you assess the struggles in the middle of the round to?  What was going on there?  
LYDIA KO: I just tried to hit a low punch shot.  Yesterday I had a problem with that where it cost me two bogeys, and the same today, twice.  So that's four shots.  I just tried to hit a low shot kind of going through the wind a little bit better, but I just didn't get aggressive enough and it flooded even more and ended up not working in my favor.   
 Q.  Had your whole family; what did you do last night and what will you do tonight?  
LYDIA KO: We went to dinner just around the corner from the hotel.  It was great to just see family, my niece and nephews out here.  It's just really good to be able to play in front of them.  Doesn't matter if I shoot even par, under par, over par; you don't get to play in front of family or relatives that often.  So I think my third in front of them is pretty good.
