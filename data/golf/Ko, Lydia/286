Q.   Well, because of your good, consistent play you've been able to do a lot of fun things lately.   Your shoot in San Francisco, the Callaway shoot, the Golf Channel.   Is that kind of stuff really fun for you still?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, it was a lot of fun.   You know, San Francisco is definitely one of my favorite cities, so to go out there, hang out, hit a ball towards the Golden Gate Bridge.   Not many people can do that, so yeah, it was really fun.
With the Callaway shoot it was good that it was like a group of us doing it, and it's hard for players to get together and do something.   So I had a lot of fun doing that. 
And the Golf Channel, we tried to bash some things and be serious.   So yeah, no, it was fun.

Q.   Now, your sister is out here this week and she was here last week, too.   Can you talk about how important it is to have family here and support and to take your mind off of the game every once in a while?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   I think support is enormous.   You know, I've had such great, loving support from my family.   So yeah, you know, it's great, and my sister and I, we have a big age difference, eight years.   So no, even when we were in New Zealand, we hardly got to see each other, so now that she's over here and we can spend last week and the next two weeks, I think it's quality time.
And I mean she doesn't play golf, but she I think understands it.

Q.   And final question, this is the final tuneup before the first major, the ANA Inspiration.   Is there anything that you're going to be working on this week leading up to that?
LYDIA KO:   No.   I mean to play well in a major, you pretty much got to have your a game.   So hopefully, you know, if I have a good week here this week, you know, I know that I'll bring a lot of confidence going into next week.   But two different courses.   So you know, it's hard to compare them course management wise, but definitely I'm going to concentrate on this week first and hopefully it will be a fun major next week.

Q.   Now, I lied about the final question.   You said you gotta have your a game.   With the streaks that I read off, do you have your a game right now?
LYDIA KO:   I hope so.   Yeah.   I hope so.   No, I worked a little bit on my swing with David last week in Phoenix, and he's not here this week, so I'll see what I can do without him.
Yeah, no, I guess everything is just the last couple of events, it's leading towards the majors, so hopefully it'll be building up, and you know, even this week.

Q.   Do you feel the pressure, I mean you're 17 years old, that you're kind of becoming the face of the LPGA, and girls your age or maybe even older are looking up to you.   Do you enjoy that?   Do you embrace that, kind of where you've been put?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   It's pretty cool to have girls or boys that are similar age to me, and they say, oh, I look up to you.   In a way it's a little awkward because I don't know exactly what kind of response I should be doing.   But you know, it's really fun, and you know, last week, with the girls' golf, they had, I think like there were the girls there, on Sunday prior to the event, and they said, oh, sign up if you're 17 years and younger, and I mean I could enter that. 
So yeah, it's definitely different.   But you know, it's cool that, you know, I'm one of the younger ones here, and you know, I'm excited for maybe one or two years later, there will be a group of 17, 18‑year‑olds.
