 Q.  It is the end of the ANA Inspiration, the first major of the year.  What are some of the things you learned from your play throughout the week?  
LYDIA KO: I mean, the positives were my putting was really good this week.  If it wasn't for the putter I would definitely be shooting higher scores than I did.   
Yeah, no, my ball striking really just not on this week.  Had been really good so far up until this week, but with how thick the rough is it's really penalizing to be off the fairways and off the greens.   
Yeah, no, it definitely didn't work in my favor that this week is the week that things weren't really on, especially in a set up that demanded it to be on.  No, overall a fun week here.  I like the west coast.  I always love seeing the fans here out on the 18th grandstand.   
Yeah, another major until the books.   
 Q.  What are some of the things that you're most looking forward to coming up on the schedule?  
LYDIA KO: Obviously L.A. San Fran, another west coast swing.  I love playing on the west coast.  San Francisco has kind of become like my third home really, especially with one of my sponsors being the main sponsor of the San Francisco week in MediHeal.   
Being a defending champion I'm sure there is going to be a lot of hype.  I'm going to enjoy it.  Soon I'm 22, so, yeah, excited to be one year older.
