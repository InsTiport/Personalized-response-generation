Q. Great round today.
LYDIA KO: Thank you.
Q. Finished with a birdie, right?
LYDIA KO: Yeah.
Q. So that was a good moment for you.  What about the rest of the day?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I played pretty solid.  Actually gave myself a lot of looks for birdie, especially on my front nine.  I had quite a few lip-outs and some close ones.
Yeah, no, overall I played really solid.  Definitely nice to be able to finish off with a birdie after a pretty lousy bogey on my 17th hole.
Yeah, I think it's a solid start to this event.
Q. How did you find the course playing today, this morning?
LYDIA KO: I think progressively the greens were getting a little firmer.  Like even the 1st hole, which was our 10th hole, we were all coming in with wedges.  A lot of our balls were just having a really big first bounce.  We actually waited on the second tee a little bit and saw the group behind, and they were also -- their balls were rolling out, too.
So the greens are definitely getting a little firmer, drier, because we've had some nice weather the past few days.
Q. The par-5, was there any advantage to the wind today?
LYDIA KO: They were all into the wind.  Yeah, so, no.  It wasn't playing the easier wind direction.  I was able to birdie a couple of them, which was nice.
Q. In the morning obviously the greens are a lot smoother than the afternoon.  What's the importance of like getting off to a good start when you have that morning tee time?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I think especially around a course where spike marks can be a factor, especially during the afternoons, I think it is important to be able to have a solid round in the morning.
But, hey, you know, sometimes spike marks can be in your favor; sometimes not.  You just have to play with what you get.  I mean, in the afternoon obviously it's a little bumpier than the morning.  You just have to kind of play with it.  You can't really control what somebody else has done.
Yeah.
Q. How key is it to get off to a fast start?  There are only two rounds left after today.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I think you kind of want to play the best you can.  Whether it's a three- or four-day event, there are still the same amount of people out here and everybody is still playing the same amount of holes.  There is no real, I guess, advantage, you know, playing well in that first round because it's a three-day event.
You do obviously want to play solid because there are less chances to catch up if you are a little behind.
