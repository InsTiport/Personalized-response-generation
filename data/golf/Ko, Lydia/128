 Q.  4-under.  Solid round today.  You think have to do more to get into contention?  
LYDIA KO: I hit the ball pretty good.  I had quite a few opportunities there.  I had a few that kind of just slid by.   
On the back nine I had some closer ones where I had tap-in birdie, which is always nice.  I think it was a pretty consistent day, and I'll take it going into the first -- I guess next three days.   
But I know there are some lower scores out there.  The person that really makes a lot of putts is going to be a big contention, in the lead, on the final day.   
 Q.  You played medic with your partner a little bit with Sei Young.  Describe what happened there.  
LYDIA KO: After she hit her second shot on the 11th hole she said, Hey, have you been stung by a bee before?   
I was like, Yeah.  It's been a while.  I said like my hand was double the size.  Then she said, I just got stung by a bee.  I'm like, What?  You need to tell someone and get some ointment on it.  She said she's been putting some ice.   
I tried to call a rules official who could bring out some ointment.  I think they brought it some ointment and like a bag of ice, and she said it helped a lot.   
67 with a bee sting, it's very impressive.   
 Q.  Do you find with every week that maybe you're thinking less about the swing and more playing golf?  How is that going?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, you know, I think I've been thinking less, which is a good thing.  I was out there and not really worrying about, Hey, where is the ball going to go?  What am I going to do?   
I think that's a really good way of putting it.  With the pre-shot routine of stepping forward, that's a big thing for me going forward with my downswing.  I think it really simplified it.  I think I haven't been thinking that much, which has been good.   
 Q.  When did you start that?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I started that actually in Australia, which was my first event.  Because of my spin-y hips that always kind of creeps in.  That's what I've had since I was like half the height I am now.   
Those kind of habits are always going to lurk around for my whole career.  The most important thing is try and control and maintain it.   
That stepping forward, stepping through drill, that helps me to load a little bit more on the left side and come down my backswing into the finish.
