Q.   We thought you were tired when you got here after a couple big weeks, but you certainly bounded back with a great round today. 
LYDIA KO:   Started off well with a 4‑under the first day and yesterday was kind of a crazy day and today I hung on and made a couple good birdies along the way.

Q.   Those birdies really came around the turn, as well, when they sort of needed to kick start to get you going. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I was playing good the first couple holes, but then I left a couple out there with those birdie opportunities on 7, and yeah, I had a really good chance on 10, just tried to give myself many opportunities.

Q.   Playing conditions were a little better today.   The breeze was up and it wasn't quite as hot which would have made it more comfortable, as well. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I think the temperature was much better, but with the breeze being up, it's obviously a little tougher to go for some of the pins. 

Q.   Do you think the position you're in, you're only one behind at this point in time, hopefully make it three in a row? 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, that would be I guess a dream three weeks, but I'm just going to try my best.   The girls are playing good golf and it's a tough course.   Just one shot can cost you a couple. 

Q.   Do you just feel‑‑ when we watched you play, you just looked so calm and in control all the time.   Are there ever any nerves because you never look like it?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I'm definitely nervous.   I think most nervous on the first tee and especially coming up on 18.
