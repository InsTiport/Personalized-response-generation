Q.   Even par 72 for the first round of the Ricoh Women's British Open, a little bit of a disappointment ending with a bogey, but how pleased are you with your round? 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I think I played pretty consistent overall.   It is a bit disappointing I guess finishing with a bogey and finishing on a hole that I wouldn't have expected to come off with a six. 
But overall I played good and just got to take this game to tomorrow, and shooting even par around here I think is a pretty good score.

Q.   How were conditions out there today? 
LYDIA KO:   The wind wasn't blowing as it was the last couple of days, but the course itself is pretty narrow, so it doesn't make it much easier for that.   But the course condition is great and I'm excited playing here. 

Q.   What were you happiest about, which part of your game? 
LYDIA KO:   Actually just happy with how I started today.   The first couple holes, they are not easy until I guess‑‑ 1‑under after three holes, that was pretty positive. 

Q.   And what was the highlight of your day? 
LYDIA KO:   The highlight, I mean, just making birdies.   I hit the fairway on 1 and I had not been doing that the last couple of days.   When you think about hitting the fairway it is quite important out here. 

Q.   Were you able to stay out of the thick stuff today?
LYDIA KO:   Majority of time I was.   I think that's why I was able to shoot even, and if I keep continuing to do that, it's going to be much easier to play this course.
