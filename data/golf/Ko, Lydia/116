Q. Currently six back.  Does that still feel like...
LYDIA KO: I mean, just looks like there is a lot of birdies out there.  I really couldn't get anything to drop, especially on the back nine.
I mean, the par putts were great, but the birdies were repelling from the hole.
So hopefully I'll be able to get some to drop on the weekend.  With this course condition, I think the players are playing aggressive, and that's why there are a lot of birdies.
Q. With the amount of players between you and the leader, do you feel like you need a couple very, very special rounds?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I think I need two special rounds, kind of like what Karrie had on that final day.  I need two of those.  If I can get the putts to roll it's definitely possible.  Nothing is impossible.
There needs to be a lot of putts dropping for sure.
Q. Obviously you stick to the business at hand, but heading into two weeks where you're the defending champion.  How much are those two weeks on your mind, especially ANA?
LYDIA KO: You know, this is my favorite stretch of events.  I don't think it real clicked until I had to do media days that I actually did win back to back.  They're great events and the sponsors are great.
My memory of jumping into the Poppy's Pond is something I'll never forget.  Hopefully I'll be able to finish well here on the weekend.
