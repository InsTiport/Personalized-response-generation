 Q.   Looks like you're going to be inside the top 50 and playing tomorrow.   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, just making the cut by a shot.   Really, I think over the last two days, I'm realizing that one shot‑‑ one little putt can make a huge difference.   I started off well.   I haven't shot under par on the back nine before, but did that.   
I missed a couple putts, birdie putts coming down the stretch, but luckily I'm playing four days, and after the first day, you know, I didn't know if I was going to play through.  
   
 Q.   What's the difference between this week and last week?  
LYDIA KO:   Last week I started off well for the week, 5‑under, and when I start the tournament off well, I'm somewhere around top 20, top 10.   Like today I was‑‑ well, the first day, just from our side, I was like fifth from last.   I'm glad that I'm able to play all four days, but like last week, I wasn't putting great, but the putts that counted went in.   But I know this week it's like‑‑ I'm making a couple along the way, but the last two days I've been making quite a few good par putts, so I guess it just balances it off.  
   
 Q.   Seems like it's you, Stacy or Inbee at the top of the leaderboard almost every week.   Inbee is at the top of the leaderboard this week.   What impresses you about Inbee's game?  
LYDIA KO:   You know, Inbee and Stacy, they're both so consistent.   They stay sometimes when they're interviewed they didn't have a good putting day, but somehow they still shoot 3‑, 4‑under par.   So that just shows that even if you don't have that top "A"game, you're still able to shoot a couple under par, and I think that's the great thing about those top two players, where they're always up there.   It's like their average day is even or 1‑ or 2‑under.   
I would love to be in that state where I'm like, oh, I had an average day and I shot 1‑ or 2‑under and have a great day and shoot 7.  
   
 Q.   But you had 29 straight rounds under par.   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, like I say, I wasn't counting, but especially during that stretch I was playing pretty consistent.   During the end of last year, during Naples, I holed a lot of good putts, and I'm actually hitting the ball much better and I feel more comfortable, but just the putts aren't dropping.   That's really crucial.   The winner is going to hole some key putts, and I'm not doing that.   
   
 Q.   What impresses you about Brooke's game?  
LYDIA KO:   Brooke?   I'm not even sure if I've even played alongside her, but especially seeing the last couple weeks and how big of a star she is for Canada and for us teens, it's really great.   I think she's really strong in the mental game.   The last couple weeks she's been up on top of that leaderboard, and sometimes it's hard to just maintain playing well, but she's consistently playing well, so really shows how great her mental game is, and I think that's a huge factor of playing good golf.   
   
 Q.   Karrie is 39, Inkster is 54, Angel is 37.   They're all at the top of the leaderboard.   Does that make you reconsider 30 as a retirement age?  
LYDIA KO:   No, my age thing hasn't changed, but I told Juli this morning, you're awesome.   She's one of a kind.   You know, if I just try and imagine that when I'm 50 or even when I'm 40, then I'm like, I want to go out and play a game with my friends and play for dinner or for a beer, but she's still playing competitive well, and it shows how great golf is that age really doesn't matter.   
I think the older you are, the more experience you get, so I think that's great.   Juli, Angel and Karrie are all showing that, hey, they've got great game, and you just‑‑ age is just a number.   
   
 Q.   What's the plan tomorrow?   I know Nepal is going to be on your mind trying to make a donation as big as possible.   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I think it's great that I don't have to worry about, hey, am I going to make the cut or not.   Tomorrow, I don't know what the pin positions are going to be like, but the weather has been great the last couple days.   I'm just going to go out there, try and make a couple of good putts, and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be, hey, close to the lead.   But just try and have fun out there and enjoy and do my best for Nepal.  
   
 Q.   Next week is an off week.   What are your plans?   Will you go to THE PLAYERS to see Phil Mickelson or anything?  
LYDIA KO:   No, I didn't know that THE PLAYERS was next week, but I'll be watching on television.   I'm going to go back to Orlando, see Sean and David and Dr.Lair (phon), and yeah, just enjoy a week off.   We don't get it that often.   This stretch was great, two weeks, and I'm back home.
