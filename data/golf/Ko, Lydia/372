Q.   How did it feel today? 
LYDIA KO:   It was good.   I had a really good front nine, which was the back nine.   I kind of got cruising.   I made my first bogey on 1, then I made pars.   There was a par streak.   Then I birdied 6, and I said, oh, okay.   Because my goal today was 4‑under, so it was like goal achieved. 
Then the next hole we were put on the clock, and I think everything went fast, and I hooked it into the hazard.   But I had a good up‑and‑down and made bogey, so that was okay.   Then I finished with a birdie on 9.   So it was good overall.   Pretty happy and goal achieved.

Q.   At 4‑under in this event, that's pretty darn good on the first day.   You're right up there with the stars here?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, that's good.   It's always good to scramble with the pros.   It was a really good day at the office for me, so hopefully that will continue in the next few days.

Q.   You come in here with a lot of confidence I imagine given what's happened over the last few months? 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I've played three events before this and I've gotten a medal for each event, so that's pretty good.   Hopefully I'll be able to get a medal this week as well. 
I mean, I won the U.S. Amateur, and to me putting was never my confident part, and I was putting really good at the amateur.   And Kay Cockerill said I was a show game queen, so I think that went really good, and my putting helped a lot today.   The greens weren't that fast.   But there were a few tricky points, and I think I went really well. 

Q.   Who said you were a short game queen? 
LYDIA KO:   Kay Cockerill.

Q.   Who is that? 
LYDIA KO:   She played on the LPGA Tour, and she's won many events.

Q.   So she likes your short game? 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   I chipped in three times last week, and I don't get chip‑ins‑‑ I don't get three chip‑ins in a year, so it's good to have three chip‑ins in one tournament.   She said you are a short putt queen.

Q.   This is your first LPGA event; is that correct? 
LYDIA KO:   I played the U.S. Open and the Australian Open, yeah.

Q.   So are you feeling comfortable around these big stars? 
LYDIA KO:   I'm getting there.   I mean, it's kind of nerve‑racking to play along with the pros.   I've played a few professional events, but this is my third LPGA event.   Everyone is here, and the world's best are here.   So, yeah, it's always good.   I mean, it's good that I played good along with them.

Q.   I know you're South Korean born; is that correct? 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.

Q.   A lot of South Koreans here really made a charge today.   Do you feel there is something about Vancouver, the cultural dynamics here that give you some support out there?   Did you feel supported out here by a different crowd? 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I mean, wherever I go I don't feel like I lack support in any way.   So it's really good to have people.   Actually, apart from my mom, I actually had two New Zealand people that are over here.   They always do this trip in the middle of the year, and they came and it's good to have them here.   It's always good to have people back home supporting.   Yeah, it was really nice.

Q.   Can we see another round like this from you?   It put you in pretty good stead the rest of the way. 
LYDIA KO:   I hope so.   This year I've been kind of finishing quite bad overall.   Last year I kind of charged up the leaderboard in the end the last few rounds.   But this year that's kind of disappearing, so hopefully from this event, I'll go up and up and up (laughing).
