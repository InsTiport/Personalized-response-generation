  Q. Lydia, what great round three at Lake Nona.  How do you feel now that you've finished the round?
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I felt like it could have been a little bit better.  Had pretty much one bad hole, but other than that I felt like I played pretty solid.  Wish more putts could have dropped, but it's going to be -- it's pretty tough out there, so hopefully just be able to keep playing solid and give myself good opportunities tomorrow.
 Q. What, if anything, really tested your game today?  Maybe pin locations or the weather?
 LYDIA KO:   I don't think I hit it as close and I holed a few of the mid-range putts over the last couple days, and I think I holed maybe one.  So I didn't really have a lot of momentum going.
 Sometimes you're going to get days like that so you just have to play and be patient out there.  I think for the most parts I was able to do that pretty well.
 Yeah, when I'm out there I just got to focus on the shots in front of me and stay positive and patient, and that's all I can do.
 Q. You know how to shoot really low here, proven on the first day.  Tomorrow what is your goal and what do you hope to shoot?
 LYDIA KO:   I think I just got to focus on my game, play the best golf I can, and see where that puts me.  There are so many players playing really well, so I think it's just important not to get caught up in what everybody else is doing and just do a good job focusing on me and the shot that I have in front of me.
 Q. And of course you have a home course advantage, but you also have home course advantage when I comes to fans.  How is it to see their faces and all your neighbors out here supporting you?
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, there are so many familiar faces, members who I see on the driving range, around the golf course.  Yeah, always good to see them.  And a lot of families have young kids out.  The weather has been pretty nice so it's been really nice to see them out here and cheer us on.
 Q. (Indiscernible.)  How do you move on from that?
 LYDIA KO:   Well, I felt like I've been putting really sold and putting good strokes on it and the putts that I miss I didn't really put a bad stroke, I just hit it way too hard.  When you do that, I mean, at the end of the day it's careless mistakes.
 But you just got to move on and focus on the next shot and not get too caught up in what happened before.  I have a tendency of like the shots before getting in my head for a while, and I think I'm doing a better job of getting over that and moving on and doing my best in the next one.
 Q. How aggressive do you think you can be on this golf course?
 LYDIA KO:   I think you have to play smart, but I think the wind direction is a huge factor around this golf course.  It was south or some sort of south wind all day, and I think that way some holes play very differently.
 Everyone is going to play the same golf course with a similar wind.  You just have to go out there and play the strategy, my strategy.  It may be different to somebody else's.  Hopefully I'll be able to do a good job this the course management.
 Q. My final question is:  I notice on your left hand you have a little bandage around it.  Did you have it all week?
 LYDIA KO:   I had it for most of my last few years.  It's just a precautionary thing and not an injury.  It's bigger -- that's not that big of a deal than it looks.
