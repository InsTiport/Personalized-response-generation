Q. (Regarding hair color.)
LYDIA KO: You know, I went lighter in like May this year, and my original black hair was grown out so I said, I need to balance this out for Asia.  I felt like the color was a little iffy, all this color, because it was a little orangey.  I can't do blonde when I'm like 40, so I'm going to do this now.
I've been getting pretty good reviews.  It takes a lot of work, but I'm going to try and maintain this for a while.
Q. How about the Asia Swing?  Great to be back?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I think the Asia Swing is definitely one of I guess my favorite stretch of the year.  I feel like we get to experience a lot of different Asian cultures.  For me this week it's my first time in mainland China, so I've been trying lots of different food.  It was fun playing in the program.
Just a great experience.  The LPGA is such a global tour, so for us to go to these stops where Shanshan is from, I think it's a really good experience not only for us but for the juniors and people here.
Q. Nights like this at the pro-am parties bring together the people you played with and also sponsors of the LPGA. How important are nights like this for the Tour?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, you know, without them, there would be no tournament.  Because of the support from Buick and all the other sponsors, that's why we're able to play and these amazing golf courses in and these amazing cities.
So I think it's a cool time where we get to meet people from outside of the golfing industry and get to know what they do and where they're from.  One of the guys I met today he's from I think Guangzhou, which is a place where my friend is going to be competing in swimming later this year.
So it feels like big world is small, so always good it meet good people.
