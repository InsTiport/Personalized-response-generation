Q. Nice finish, crowd pleaser.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I mean, I was in aggressive -- a little bit more of an aggressive course management going down the last, but I hit my drive well where if I was far enough up, I could possibly carry these bunkers, and I hit the 3-wood really well, too, so when you're at the front of the green, especially with that pin position, it's a little easier.  But whenever you finish off on the 18th hole with a birdie, and especially here where there's a donation to the children's hospital, I'm happy that I made two donations, the first day and today.  But what CP is doing for the children's hospital, I think it's great.  It's been a super fun week.
Q. Canada loves you; I know you probably wanted maybe a different result today, but you're still very much a fan favorite here.
LYDIA KO: I think I was a little far away going into today.  I needed to maybe shoot 18-under by the looks of where the other girls are playing.  But no, it's been a great week.  I played solid all week, and there's a lot of positives to take from this week.  I'm happy with it, and especially when I'm defending and I'm still able to have a top-10 finish.  I think it was a great week, and I really appreciate all the support from the crowds here.
