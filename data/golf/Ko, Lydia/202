Q. Another good round, headed into the weekend in a great position.  Can you talk about your ability to scramble today?  It was a key factor.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I didn't strike the ball as well as I did yesterday, especially on my back nine, I had to make up-and-down from a few places.
The rough is rough, so when you get in there, it's tough to get close to the pin or even on the green sometimes.  Sometimes I got fortunate but other times I was able to scramble and I think that's the most important thing around here.
Obviously you need to hit the fairway and give yourself good looks for birdies, but when you don't have that opportunity and you need to make up-and-down, it's important to try and do that.
Q. With ANA looming, how much does that play a factor into your mind-set this weekend?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I can't believe our first major is already around the corner next week.  This is a great swing of events, the Founders Cup, Kia Classic and obviously the ANA Championship.  It's a fun few weeks.  I've just got to enjoy it.  I haven't played as best as I think I could have at ANA, and I think my personal goal is to try and have my personal best finish.
So I've just got to enjoy it, and obviously I've got two long days ahead of me here.  Hopefully finish off solid and then have confidence going into next week.
