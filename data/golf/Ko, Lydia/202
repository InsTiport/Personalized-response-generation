 Q.  How big was that birdie on 18 to get it back to red numbers?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I was never under par during my round.  Hit it out of bounds on 2, so after a double and considering how tough it is, it's hard to kind of fight back.   
Especially that front nine.  It was birdie, bogey, birdie, bogey.  But it's tough out there.  I think I was struggling a little bit with club selection, especially when I was hitting out of the rough.  I got it together on the back nine, so it was good to finish strong.   
 Q.  How much momentum does that back nine give you going into tomorrow morning?  
LYDIA KO: Definitely big momentum going into tomorrow.  Starting on the back nine tomorrow, but around this course, you obviously -- this is the prevailing wind and you expect it to be this strong.  I think the big difference is the pin positions.   
Maybe the back nine, but depending on the pin positions it can make it tougher, easier, and all that.  I just got to play confident.  Sometimes it's going to be really tough with the wind.  Could be into, across, and there are a lot of things to think about.   
I've just got to be confident with the club I have and just commit to it.   
 Q.  After a little bit of rust, the double on 2, how do you stay in it mentally and erase that?  
LYDIA KO: I've got 16 more holes to go.  I've got 16, so going to try and give myself as many birdie opportunities as I can, knowing that I think No. 5 is a good birdie hole.  I knew that when I got the short clubs, that's when I can try and go for it.   
I just try and stay positive.  I know it's tough out there.  That's why you don't see any crazy low scores.  Especially this afternoon.  I don't know exactly how strong it was in the morning.  Just got to expect the wind.  You know it's tough, so you just have to stay patient.
