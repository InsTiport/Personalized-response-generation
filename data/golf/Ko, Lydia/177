Q. Why are you smiling right now?
LYDIA KO: I played really solid today.  Brooke just outplayed me.  You can see her confidence is really high.  And for her to go right at the pin on the 18th in the playoff, it's amazing.  So I know that I played solid.  That's all I can do.  Even though I came second, I'm proud to be in this position.
Q. This time last year you were in her shoes, how proud of her are you?
LYDIA KO: She's been playing really solid all year, a bunch of top-10s.  And for her to win this and for her to win her first major, it's amazing.  And when she's doing it at her age, she's still only 18.  I think it's great.  I think it's great for the Tour.  And it's good for the women's game.
Q. I talked to Jason since Evian, and you and I discussed this yesterday.  You seem more at ease on the golf course.  How are you feeling right now after this experience?
LYDIA KO: It's really cool to put myself in position to contend and to lead.  Going into today I said I've just got to play my own game.  And that's all you can do out here.  But I think definitely winning at Evian gave me confidence just to trust myself and say, hey, you are able to play well at these majors.  And it definitely was a confidence booster.
