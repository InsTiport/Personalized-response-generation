LYDIA KO: I putted really well today.  I gave myself many looks for birdies.  A lot of the putts, if they didn't go in, they were close.  So it was overall a really good round.  Obviously that's not that great to end with a bogey and double on the last two holes, but overall, I think I played more solid today compared to yesterday, so it's good signs going into the weekend.   
 Q.  If you hadn't been finding the water so much, you would probably be up there on the leaderboard leading this tournament?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, one or two from yesterday led to like three shots and then two today.  I kind of find it on the wrong holes.  If I find it on a par 5 or something, then I've got some room to deal with.  But even hitting it in the water, I was struggling to make double on the last.   
 Q.  Of course it's all about adjustments, as well.  You come into the tournament with a new caddie.  How is it going?  
LYDIA KO: It's been going good.  He's got a lot of experience so we've been having a lot of fun out there and he's been trying to keep me cool out here in the heat, which is a pretty big role the weather plays.   
 Q.  How does he try to keep you cool?  Does he bring you cold towels, lots of cold water and stuff like that?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, he pretty much has a separate cool towel and he sets it in the icy water on every tee and gives me water to drink here and there.  I kind of have to stay really hydrated in this heat and even though it's not hot, it's really humid and I think that's what gets it.   
 Q.  What is the game plan for the rest of the day today?  Will head back out to the putting green or the driving range?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I'm probably going to hit a few putts and then hit a few balls on the range.  Because it is so hot out here, I don't want to drain a lot of energy.  Just polish on a few things and then go back to the hotel and have a good afternoon off.
