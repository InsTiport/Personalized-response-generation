LYDIA KO: It wasn't like we were playing with any mud balls.  Just on the greens was the toughest part out there.  Not easiest pin positions, and even if you're 15, 12 feet, you could be running it three, four feet by.  That's how fast the greens were.  Obviously the superintendents have been doing an awesome job trying to keep the greens in great condition.   
 Q.  Given all that, and you're playing golf, did you even give a thought possibly that you're playing against the No. 2 and 3 players in one group?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I saw the pairing and I didn't realize it until somebody mentioned it to me, so it's a pretty cool pairing.  Hopefully tomorrow all of us will be able to shoot under par and have even more of a good time, but just personally, I didn't feel like I was playing really bad out there.  Just a couple or three shots I was giving away.  We still had a pretty good time.  Obviously if we play better tomorrow, then it will be even better.   
 Q.  Did that drive you, the fact that it's 1-2-3?  
LYDIA KO: No, you don't really get paired -- I haven't been paired much with Inbee, but I've been paired up with Lexi quite a lot this season.  It's always good when somebody is playing well because you can feed off them, especially that front nine.  We were all playing pretty consistently.  I think we were feeding off the birdies from each other.   
 Q.  I heard the conditions are supposed to be sunnier tomorrow.  Will that affect the course?  
LYDIA KO: I'm sure it makes the greens a little firmer, I guess dry out the fairways just a little bit more, but it's not like there was puddles of water on any parts of the course.  Considering how much rain they've had before we've come here and how much rain they had on Tuesday, I think it's in really good condition.  So I guess the sunnier it is, I'm sure it'll make it a little drier, but I've heard it could be a wet Saturday, so that could change things around.
