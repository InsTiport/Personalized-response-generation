LYDIA KO: I have a lot of great memories with the USGA, being a past U.S. Women's Amateur champion.  I loved it here.  The fans are great.  And the majority of the holes the fans are cheering me on, and I enjoyed it.  This was a great experience.  And this is something I'm going to learn from.
Q. Now, the group was put on the clock, did that affect the rhythm, did it affect how you were playing and approaching things on the back nine?
LYDIA KO: You know, we fell behind during the middle of our front nine.  But me finding trouble on 9 and trying to look for the ball, taking the drop, it was tough to even get back into that position.  So I kind of feel bad because I feel it was a little bit my fault that we ended up being that far behind, but when it is windy and when every shot counts to feel a little rushed is tough.  But we fell out of position, and that's all we can do.
Q. There are lots more U.S. Opens in your future, and indeed a lot of majors coming up, and thanks for being such a part of the story this week.
LYDIA KO: Thank you.
