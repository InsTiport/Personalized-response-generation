Q. Lydia, I know you don't look at breaking records and streaks (Indiscernible).  We've talked so much about it and there is a lot of pressure on you to do it.  What does this feel like for you?LYDIA KO: I mean, I started off well today, and then I kind of went on a bogey streak.  So I was really busy trying to make some birdies and recover from some of my bad shots.  So I really wasn't thinking about it, but ended up finishing under par.  It's not easy out here.  There are some really tough pin positions, so overall I'm happy with where I am for this tournament.  It's just pretty cool to tie Annika's record.Q. One of those very difficult pin positions was on your second to last hole.  You went to number 8, even par, and hit it to about 18 inches.  What was going through your mind after you hit that shot?LYDIA KO: I thought it looked good in there.  So I saw that it landed just on, and it kind of released, I said, okay, that kind of made it easy.  Then Lexi hit another great shot in there, so, yeah, we made the hole seem very easy.  And then I looked back and saw Paula hit a good shot in there too. So, yeah, it's very tough, so you kind of have to be aggressive and then not aggressive at some points.  But I wasn't driving the ball very well, and when you're in that kind of position trying to hit out of the rough, it doesn't get any easier.
