Q. Thoughts on the week?
LYDIA KO: I didn't finish very well, so that was a little disappointing, but overall the weekend was some pretty solid golf, so I'm proud of that.
Q. I know you've been working on some things with David Leadbetter; are you almost there?
LYDIA KO: I think it's never perfect and I'm pretty sure there will be times where it will be close to perfect and we'll work towards that.  I don't know if the swing can ever be perfect or have a perfect round.
But I felt like I struck the ball better the last two days, so that was a good sign.
Q. You won six times worldwide last year.  Do you feel like you're anywhere close to that peak of 2015?
LYDIA KO: I feel as though I'm playing really solidly, so I just have to take the positives.  I didn't hole that many putts this week.  So I think that's kind of the key, especially when you need to go low, you need to hole a few putts this week but that wasn't happening this way.  Overall I feel like I've had a pretty solid start to the season, so I'm pleased with that.
Q. How was your day today?
LYDIA KO: It was good.  I had a really good front nine.  It's not the best way to end with a bogey on the last, but other than that, I thought I played really solidly this weekend, so there's still a lot of positives from this week.
I feel like it could have been better.  I didn't hole that many putts this week but the weekend was pretty good.  I tried to give myself quite a few opportunities.
