  LYDIA KO:   Got in that birdie rhythm, bird 11 and 12.   And then I made par and then I made eagle.   And I think Jess's chip‑in, it kind of inspired me to make an eagle myself.   I was like, oh, I need to beat her, that kind of feeling.   And Inbee made eagle, too, so 5‑under total for our group on that hole was pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Was there just not a whole lot falling the first front ten holes or so?  
LYDIA KO:   I didn't really hit it as close.   11, I had like a 12‑foot putt, and then, you know, it was all within that kind of a range on every hole, a really long one.   
So those kind of putts, some of them dropped, birdies, you don't expect to hole everything, but a couple at a time is good.  
   
 Q.   You gotta like your position.   You could have been, I mean up until 11 you were probably six or seven back.   Now you're just two back into the weekend.   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I was really surprised.   I played really good.   I bird 12 and 13.   I'm sorry.   But like I said, just gave myself more opportunities on the back nine.   
I played much better this nine yesterday, so I kind of thought, you know, you can make some more birdies and get closer to the leader.  
   
 Q.   Did you remember your snacks?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I did.   I was munching away.  
   
 Q.   What's your snack of choice?  
LYDIA KO:   I had a protein bar and like a protein jelly, and there's always peanut butter sandwich in there.   I actually noticed that it was in my bag yesterday, but I didn't find it, so it was actually more done.   
   
 Q.   You and Mirim up at the top of the leaderboard, two rookies, do you think it's kind of funny to see two rookies up at the top battling?  
LYDIA KO:   It's great.   She's obviously playing really good golf, and there are a lot of birdies out there.   It's great to see two rookies out there.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever played with her?   Have you met‑‑  
LYDIA KO:   No, I've never really met her before, so should be good tomorrow to meet her and get to know another rookie.
