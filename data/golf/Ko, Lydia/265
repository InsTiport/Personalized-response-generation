  COLIN CALLANDER: 73 today in the worst of the weather. How difficult was it out there.  
LYDIA KO: It was really difficult. The wind being strong is one thing; and it was definitely a totally different direction to what it was yesterday. So the course was kind of like playing a new course. But it was so tough. The wind was really strong when we were by the water.   
So, you know, it was hard to keep it in the short stuff. So I made a couple bogeys because of that.   
COLIN CALLANDER: Was the wind completely different to anything you've played so far this week even in practise?   
LYDIA KO: Probably the craziest weather I had on Monday when I was out there in rain and wind, but it was getting pretty close when we were on 11, 12. I tried to hide behind the signs and stay away.   
COLIN CALLANDER: Before you went out you probably saw the scores and knew it must have been difficult. Did you have a plan in mind to counter that?   
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I knew that it wasn't going to be another 66 or 67 that would be the low round of the day. I saw Suzann's score and thought, hey, she must have played pretty good. But no, it's really tough and when you get this kind of weather, you're grinding out there.   
   
 Q. I take it today was as cold, wet and miserable as you've been on a golf course?   
LYDIA KO: I've had worse. British Open at Hoylake was probably the worst. Yeah, I'm hoping it doesn't get any worser than that, yeah.   
   
 Q. You can cope with the conditions, obviously.   
LYDIA KO: I guess. What are we going to do? There's not much we can do about it. As long as we are out there and we need to play, we just have to play with it. It's not like it's only me out there. It's a whole group. The whole field is out there playing. I just try to focus on my game and just think about that one shot that I needed to hit.   
   
 Q. Can you just sum up how good 69 is?   
LYDIA KO: Yeah, it was windy from this morning. Might not have rained a lot but still there was a lot of wind out there. So to shoot even or under par is really impressive. Suzann, I don't think she made that many bogeys‑‑ one bogey; that's really impressive.  
To do that on any golf course without wind is hard. But it just shows how flawless she played.   
COLIN CALLANDER: You've experienced conditions like this; you just talked about Hoylake. Do you think that gives you an advantage over some of the girls?   
LYDIA KO: I think most of the girls played that week. But, you know, it is what it is. The weather, there's no switch of where we can switch it to warmer weather or a couple degrees cooler or whatever. It's part of it, and like I've been saying all week, you come to a British Open and you're going to get all these elements.  
   
 Q. Did you have to play different kind of shots today? Can you give an example of maybe something that you had to do that you wouldn't normally do or shots like that in a round?  
LYDIA KO: I tried to hit a lot of knock‑down shots today. I know some were good and some didn't. But yeah, I think the wind was really the big thing. Like on 16, I hit 3‑wood, 3‑wood and I just made it to the green. Yesterday I hit 5‑wood, 8‑iron. So that's how much the wind was a factor.   
I tried to keep my ball as low as possible so that the wind wouldn't be affected as much, but it still was affected.   
   
 Q. You said that you played on Monday and the conditions were slightly worse. Is it a question then to come in and finish your practise or stay out and get used to the conditions; is that a decision that you had to make anticipating what might happen this week?   
LYDIA KO: Yeah, you know, I played nine holes on Monday. I walked to No. 10. I knew that it would be quite a walk. But I was really whipped before I teed off, as much as the wind was. I think I'm going to keep saying this, but it is what it is.   
   
 Q. I was just wondering how many layers you've got on, and were you warm enough?   
LYDIA KO: I think like three‑‑ I was playing in three layers and my rain jacket, so four layers. But I had five layers on Monday and David said I look like I gained weight. So I'm trying not to wear a lot of clothes.  
COLIN CALLANDER: And this is summer.   
LYDIA KO: It's hard to believe it's summer.   
   
 Q. Were you warm enough?   
LYDIA KO: Yeah, my hands were getting kind of cold. My hand were getting cold out there, so I tried to use the hand warmers. I wasn't warm but I tried to keep myself as warm as possible without trying to limit my swing.  
   
 Q. And how did you manage to maintain your concentration when it was so slow and you had to wait so often in such conditions?   
LYDIA KO: The wait wasn't that bad because it gave me some time to kind of chill out a little bit, because to keep playing in that, it takes a lot of energy.   
So I was eating my sandwich. My bread was getting a little wet in the rain. The wait wasn't that bad. Obviously you would love momentum and just keep going and going. But pretty much because we were at the start of the afternoon field, we're pretty close to the morning field; so there will always be a little bit of a gap. And because some of the par 5s are reachable, I think that creates a little bit of a wait on some of the tees, too.   
COLIN CALLANDER: Can we quickly go over the birdies and bogeys?   
LYDIA KO: 2, I made a bogey. I hit 5‑wood off the tee, and I said keep away from the pot bunker. It was better in the bunker actually. It was like half a foot from in the bunker and I chipped out in the rough. Then hit a shot on the green, 2‑putt.   
First birdie was on 4. I hit an 8‑iron from 150‑something, pin‑high. Putted in from like 12 feet.   
6 was my bogey. It could have been much worse. I hit 5‑iron into the bunker and I had no shot going towards the pin, so I kind of hit it backwards. And then I chipped it to maybe about seven yards. Then I put it in for bogey.   
On 7 I made birdie. I hit 5‑wood off the tee and 6‑iron from 190‑something. I 2‑putted from just on the fringe.   
11, it was 170‑something. I tried to hit a low six. I hit it in the bunker. I hit it out. 2‑putt for bogey.   
12, I hit it right and then I hit it left. Then I hit it on the green and 2‑putt bogey.   
Next, hit it in the left rough and then I hit it in the left rough again and 2‑putt bogey.   
Next hole, driver and then 3‑wood short, like 30‑something‑yard chip. Had like a 9‑ or 10‑footer for birdie. Made that.   
Next hole, I don't know what the distance was, but I hit my hybrid 23 a little low, and then I had like a 20‑yard put and holed that. That was it.   
COLIN CALLANDER:  Lydia, thank you very much.
