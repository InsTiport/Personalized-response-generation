Q. Shanshan was three back I think last year when she won here.  Give you pretty good hope?
LYDIA KO: She was?  (Laughter.)  I mean, I played alongside her last year and she shot and amazing 63.  I think that was 63.
Q. Yeah.
LYDIA KO: But, yeah, you know, so in a way -- and I saw some great golf yesterday.  In a way I got see some great golf to maybe lead me to doing that a couple times tomorrow.
But, no, I mean, I just got to focus on my game.  I know that the other girls are making a lot of birdies and playing really good golf.
So for me to win by the end of the day or get close to the leaders, I need to play some solid golf.
Q. I know you and Jess are tight.  What was it like playing with her and is it good to see her back on top of the leaderboard?
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I mean, she played really solid.  She played really solid the last couple days.  Yeah, you know, she's such a close friend.  She's so much fun to play alongside.  She makes everybody laugh.  I told her on 17 she makes people smile.
That's a great thing about her.  Every time I play alongside her we have so much fun.  At least I do.
Q. Stacy said 8-under is out there for the taking but you can't chase it or you can get in trouble in a hurry; is that pretty accurate in your opinion?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I think is.  If you go in the rough (indiscernible) the fairways it's tough.  Especially with the Bermuda rough.  You don't know what you're dealing with.  You can end up with some big, big scores.
Even holes like 15, it's like 117 to the hole, but it's a tricky little par-3.  Could be six yards too long and go in the water, and the same for being short.
So, you know, I think distance is not all there is.  Obviously if you're putting well and you're putting yourself in good positions, 8-under is out there.  She's right.
Then also you can miss in some places and be in trouble.
Q. Is it surprising to you to be at point in the season and Jess and Stacy not have a win.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I mean, Jess is such a solid player.  You know, her iron game is great, and I think she's one of the best putters on the tour.
Stacy, she's always up there.  She's always contending and always around the leaders or leading.  So I'm pretty -- I said before all this Asia swing started that she will make -- have a win by the end of the season.
She shot like 1-over the first day, but look how she comes back the next two days.  I think you just never know until the last putt drops on the last day.  She's right there.
Q. But you still want to beat both of 'em, right?
LYDIA KO: Yes, obviously, because we're all out there trying to play our best good finishes.  They're both awesome players and they're both thinking the same thing, too.
So I wish the best of luck to everybody.  I hope everybody has 8-under.
Q. How much fun has it been the way the Malaysian people have embraced you and followed you around this week?  Big crowd out there today.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, it's been great.  I was first off yesterday and there were spectators on the 10th tee.  So they're all loving us here.
What Sime Darby did outside the golf course gives us a lot of options to be here and look at it without even being course.  I think it doesn't only attract golfers, but people that just want to come out here and have a good day.
