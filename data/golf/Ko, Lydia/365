 Q.   You're defending champion, the first person to do that since 1987.   Lydia shot 64 today.   Nobody else was better than 67.   Is this the best golf you've played?   
LYDIA KO:   I shot 10â€‘under at the Australian Open this year, and that was round one.   That was great, but today I was in a little bit more of a pressure position, so I was really happy with my 64.   I got off to a really good start, so that kind of helped my day.  
   
 Q.   The question everybody in the golf world wants to know about you is you've been so successful at age 16.   You're still an amateur.   Will that change?   Will you decide to go forward?   
LYDIA KO:   You know, I've always said I'm thinking about it.   That is the same answer right here.   Nothing has changed within the last 72 hours.   So, yeah, I'm happy at the moment.   I think this win will make us think a little better and think what is a good option.
