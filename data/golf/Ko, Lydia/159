 Q.  How did you feel out there today?  
LYDIA KO: You know, I hit the ball really solid and I gave myself so many looks at birdies, but really not one of them dropped.  You know, when you're having those kind of days, it's really hard for you to go low.  It was a little bit of a struggle with the putter, but I feel like there's still a lower round in me tomorrow.  All I've got to do is just be confident and trust my game.   
 Q.  Coming up to the 18th and seeing this big crowd, I know you're used to it with the CP Women's Open, but is there a different feel for it this year in Calgary?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, they've almost taken me in as one of their own, and it's really cool when the fans are excited to see us here.  That makes us more excited to play some good golf.  To see the number of people out here supporting us is really cool to see, especially with the CP Canadian Women's Open being such a big and special tournament for me.  This is a very special week.   
 Q.  Heading into tomorrow, what's the goal for yourself and any challenges you're hoping to set to the side?  
LYDIA KO: You know, I've just got to play my own game.  I think I need to be a little bit aggressive.  I feel like my game plan isn't the thing that's letting me down a little bit.  It's just those few putts that lip out go in.  Those are three, four shots straight away.  Just got to trust it.  There's still a lot of golf to be played, and who knows what's going to happen.
