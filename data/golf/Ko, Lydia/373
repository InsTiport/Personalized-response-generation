  CHRISTINA LANCE:   We're here at Sebonack Golf Club, Southampton, New York, for the 68th playing of the U.S. Women's Open.   Our final pre‑championship press conference, we have 2012 U.S. Women's Amateur Champion Lydia Ko with us.   Thanks so much for coming.   Just talking, 16 years old, already so successful, multiple professional wins, No. 1 ranked amateur TOUR in the world.   What's the last year been like for you?   
LYDIA KO:   It's been pretty crazy and very hectic, but I think it's hopefully only the start of my career and success.   Just because I've won a couple tournaments, I don't think it means I'm a huge star and stuff.   So, yeah, I've got a long way to go.   I need to continuously practice hard and work hard to become a good player.   
CHRISTINA LANCE:   Lydia, what are your thoughts about the golf course?   I think you just played 18 holes.   Tell us what you think about Sebonack.   
LYDIA KO:   This golf course, I think you need to be very creative out here.   The greens are very tricky.   I mean, this is what you expect at the Open.   Yeah, you don't expect the women to shoot 20‑under par and stuff.   So it's going to be really hard, especially if the wind gets up, I think it will be even harder.  
   
 Q.   I know you have an assistant pro on the bag.   How helpful has he been in giving you some local knowledge?   Did you choose him or did he choose you?   How did that happen?   
LYDIA KO:   I guess we chose him.   Yeah, the head pro here, Jason, he is a New Zealander, so we kind of got to know him first, and then he connected us with Louis.   Yeah, he's definitely very helpful.   
It's not like my home course out here, so I don't know everything but for him.   It is pretty much his home course.   So, yeah, he knows the course way better than me, especially when it gets, you know‑‑ when I'm in pressure mode, I think that's when he'll help the most.  
   
 Q.   You were the low amateur last year, Lydia.   What kind of experience can you take from last year's Women's Open and maybe apply to this year?   
LYDIA KO:   Last year I was very nervous.   I had the shakes on the first hole, but I think I'll be a little better this year.   I played a couple other majors after the Open, so I think I'm kind of getting a little more used to it.   Yeah, I'll definitely be nervous, but not terrified.  
   
 Q.   What did winning those two professional tournaments do for your confidence?   I mean, you won them after last year's Open, so does that‑‑ do you come in here with a little bit more calm about yourself?   
LYDIA KO:   I played well last week, and I think that was the biggest boost because it's much closer to this event.   I think coming off a really good week makes me most confident.   But you never know what's going to happen.   
Yes, I guess I'm playing pretty well, but I get nervous.   When I'm in nervous positions, that's when you don't hit it as well as you want to.   And I think that happens with all players.   So, yeah, hopefully I can perform to what I can.  
   
 Q.   You said this takes a creative player here.   What is your creativity quotient like?   What sort of a creative player are you?   
LYDIA KO:   I kind of ‑‑ half of my actual shots are pretty much know my caddie Louis's thoughts.   He's like okay, hit it over there, and I hit it there.   And that's been working so far.   Yeah, he's the more creative one at the moment.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever played on greens like these before, and I'm most curious about the distance of the golf course, is it playing long for you?  
LYDIA KO:   These greens are quite undulated pretty much.   I don't think I've played on these undulated greens before.   I've played on undulated greens, but not this much.   Yeah, the course is long.   It's much longer than the other tournaments I've played, but I think the wind will make it shorter or longer, and there are a couple of long holes out here.   
Yeah, I was hitting like 3‑wood into one hole yesterday, and I was hitting 6‑iron today.   So I think wind makes a huge difference.  
   
 Q.   You're obviously used to scenic golf courses with Cape Kidnappers, and Kauri Cliffs and some of the beautiful resorts in your neck of the woods.   Can you talk about being here on the east end of Long Island, and what your thoughts are?   Have you heard anything about the Hamptons before coming here?   
LYDIA KO:   No, I didn't know what this area would be like.   I only knew that Southampton and Hampton is quite a rich area.   That's all I knew.   
Yeah, I don't really get to play Cape Kidnappers and Kauri Cliffs much because it's kind of far away from where I'm based.   But I think it's a really nice area here.   Nice and quiet, and it's quite a nice golfing area too.
