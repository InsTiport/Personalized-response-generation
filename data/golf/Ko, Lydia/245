Q. Your ties are pretty strong, your second win at this course, third time overall, first time as a member of the course.  We thought it looked less stressful on the front nine.  Did you expect it to be less stressful on the back?
LYDIA KO: I made some really good up-and-downs.  I hit a good shot into 3.  Just I couldn't get anything going and I wasn't hitting anything close, where I was like, hey, I need to make some good birdies.
Obviously Stacy played awesome and so did the other girls, so I knew that I needed to play consistent.
Q. How much did the support from your fans play a factor in you grinding it out on the back side?
LYDIA KO: It's been such an amazing week.  I definitely share this win with everyone who came out here this week.  There were so many people out here after the Pro-Am after every hole; I was signing for five minutes and then getting to the next tee.  There's a lot of people out here, so it great to see everyone.  I just want to thank everyone for the support.  ^ .
