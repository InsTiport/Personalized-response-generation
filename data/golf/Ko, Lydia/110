 Q.  How would you sum up your day?  
LYDIA KO: I wasn't hitting the ball very good in all aspects of my game.  I wasn't putting very fantastic, either.  When I did miss the green, I didn't leave the easy, up-and-down kind of stuff.   
Overall, it was pretty average.  That's why when nothing is really able to back up and other aspects are off, you're not going to play well out there, especially when it's getting breezy.   
 Q.  No pars through seven holes, a couple birdies, but a lot of bogeys.  That's not like you, is it.  
LYDIA KO: I made a really good birdie on 1.  Hit in the bunker.  My goal tomorrow is to try and hit the fairway on 1.   
I just had a club selection error on 2.  I kind of hit it in the one spot where you can't hit it, and then just being above the hole on 3; I wasn't leaving myself easy par putts and when that happens, especially when some of these greens have a lot of slope, it's really tough.   
So yeah, it was just an iffy day but hopefully I'll be able to make a lot of birdies tomorrow and less bogeys.
