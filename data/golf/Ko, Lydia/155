 Q.  How was that round?  It seems like you were on fire the whole way around.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  You know, I started off well, you know, bringing the first, and then I kind of left 2 and 3, I kind of let it go.  You know, I had really good birdie opportunities that I just didn't commit to it.  And I was a little disappointed coming off No. 2 and 3, but then birdieing 4 and 5, I think that kind of put my mood around.  And I played with Jing Yan Jennifer, and she was playing great, too.  So I think we all just got in a good rhythm, and when I made a birdie, she made a birdie; when she made a birdie, I'd try to make a birdie.  And it was just a lot of fun, especially when the whole group is playing well, you get into a really good rhythm.  We almost see the positive of things, rather than, hey, what if this happens.   
 Q.  How much of an advantage was it to get out early on the fresh greens and the lower wind conditions?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I mean it's a little calmer today, I think, than the past two days.  Especially around a course like this when the wind is calm, you know that there are going to be some low numbers out there.  So you try and shoot that one, too.  So it was good to -- I guess it's never very good to go out early, first of all, but to go out early and have played a well, I think it worked out good.  I don't know what I'm going to end up at the end of the day, especially because the leaders have just teed off.  So there's still a lot of golf to be played, but I played my part today, so I'm happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  Canada there's a famous coffee drink called a Tim Horton's Double Double.  You're going for a Canadian double here now to win both the CP Women's Open and this Manulife Classic.  What would it mean for you to do that?  
LYDIA KO: No, it would be very special and especially because the ^ CP Canadian Women's Open being my first LPGA win back in 2012.  I can't believe it's already been four years since then to start off with, but Canada has treated me so well.  The fans have been great, and even though I wasn't one of the leading groups, you know, for people to come out and watch me in the morning and continue coming out to watch, and as the crowds got bigger, it was so cool to see.  And when you're playing at a place where you feel welcome and you know they're excited to see us here, we're excited to play some good golf.   
 Q.  To get that done on Sunday, what do you have to do?  
LYDIA KO: I think it would need to be a low one like today, especially because I think the weather is going to be pretty similar tomorrow, and you know that when you see the leaders, they've shot some low numbers, and it means they're confident with the iron shots going in and also confident with the putter; and when the leaders are like that, you know you kind of need to be on that stick or even better when you're trying to catch up.  So hopefully it's a low one, but I'm just going to enjoy it out there.  And considering where I was going at the start of today, I'm very happy with where I'm going to go tomorrow.   
 Q.  And get to sleep in anyway.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I love my sleep.  So even though I played in the morning yesterday, I could have done with some more sleep this morning.  And yeah, beauty sleep I'd say.   
 Q.  You finished your round strong yesterday.  Do you think that led into getting started strong again today?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I mean yesterday was kind of an off day.  I doubled the first hole, and when you double the first you're trying to play catchup, even though you have 17 more holes to go.  But it's always good to finish off with a birdie on any scenario whether you're leading or whatever.  So maybe that was a good vibe going in, but I always say every hole is a new hole, so you just never know, and you just gotta be positive, and at the end of the day I just gotta be positive, patient and confident, and that's a pretty good combo there.   
 Q.  So on Wednesday we talked about how at the Olympics you were kind of the middle of the pack after two rounds and you put it into gear in the third round.  Same thing today, do you wake up in the morning and say, I better get to work today?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  Yesterday I was probably working harder because I was trying to recover from all the bogeys and the double I made.  And just I think whatever the situation is, you know that doesn't matter how tough the hole is, there's always a birdie out there.  And that's what I kind of tried to think today, and especially because we were playing in the morning and it was a little bit calmer and we tried to take advantage of it.  But these holes, depending on where they put the tees and how strong the wind is, it can affect being a very tough hole to being a hole where it is pretty birdiable.  So it's just really relevant on the court setup.  They tried to have a drivable par-4 on 13.  Those kind of things can turn a round around.  So it just depends on how the combination of me playing good and how they set the course up.
