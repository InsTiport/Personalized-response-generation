Q. What a great start.  Can you talk a little bit about your round?
LYDIA KO: I hit the ball really well at the start, and then hit it really bad in the middle and then was like, Okay.  I was able to put myself there.  I made some really good up and downs on the back nine, and obviously with this being a major championship and it playing pretty tough with the fairways I think narrower than any other year that I've played here and the rough being a little bit juicier, some of those holes, if you're coming off pars, it's really not a bad score.
I think that's why patience is a huge key.  I hadn't really looked at the leaderboard all day, and I saw that like minus two was tied at the time when I was looking at it.  Just shows how tough it is.  Moments might be like a bit of a grind, but I think you just have to stay positive and you just never know until the very end.
Q. So it's playing a lot tougher in your opinion than previous years?
LYDIA KO: I think so.  Obviously some holes are lengthened and some holes they kind of grew the rough in a bit, so that makes it a little bit tighter.
But, no, that's why a little bit of a miss you might -- you'll still be in the rough.  Yeah, you just have to play smart.  If you are in not so good position, try and not get yourself out of it.  Try and play smart.  If it kind of cost you a bogey it's not bad.  You know can make a birdie on the next hole.
Q. Does it suit your style of play?
LYDIA KO: I hope so.  You know, I think here the person that drives it straight and kind of has their head straight on is going to be a big thing.  The mental side is going to be huge this week.  When you do get the birdie opportunities, try and grab them.  It's not a course that you're going to see 10-under par for a round.
Yeah, no, just playing smart and keep being leveled-headed.
Q. You been building up a lot of confidence this season.  Been playing better and better.  Feel like a win is quite close?
LYDIA KO: I hope so.  I feel like I've been playing pretty solid, apart from one event.  Overall I've been giving myself good opportunities and shooting some under par rounds.  I think that's such a big key for me, to keep putting myself there.  Even the days I don't feel like it's on, try and push through that and bring the best at what might not be the greatest days.
So, yeah, hopefully few more solid rounds and just kind of see and go from there.
Q. One of your favorite events?
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I love the west coast swing starting from Phoenix and obviously here, and then going to San Francisco.  Feel like the fans are great and we get amazing weather.
Try and take advantage of that.  Yeah, no, I feel like it's always given me a lot of positive vibes and a lot of great memories.  I try and cherish those.
