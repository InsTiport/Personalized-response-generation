Q.   Decent start. 
LYDIA KO:   I think so.   It was a pretty consistent day:   three birdies, two bogeys. 
But, you know, there aren't a lot of birdies out there.   Obviously Julie did, but, yeah, it's a tough course with this length, especially first couple where you're playing into the wind.   (Indiscernible:   wind.)

Q.   You think about the $1 million out there at all?
LYDIA KO:   No, not at all.   I enjoyed playing alongside Stacy and Inbee today.   We played together last week, so we're kind of continuing on that rhythm. 
But, no, I think it's always fun when I play alongside them.   We're not really talkative, but we do have our chats. 

Q.   Do you sense more buzz around this tournament with the $1 million on the line than last year maybe?
LYDIA KO:   I think so.   I think it grabs a lot of media attention, too.   With the spectators it's pretty awesome, because you really never know what's going to happen until that Sunday, until everyone is finished.
I think it's going to be an exciting finish.   I don't know who is going to win the million or get whatever, but we still got three more days to go.   I'm more excited that the season is over after this.

Q.   What are the plans?
LYDIA KO:   Just go home, you know, relax, put up my clubs, and just be a normal teenager and hang out with my friends.

Q.   Going back to New Zealand at all?
LYDIA KO:   I think you so.

Q.   Excited for the Rookie of the Year speech tonight?
LYDIA KO:   To say "excited" would be the wrong word.   I'm a little nervous.   I'm not a very good speaker in front of a large crowd, so I'm definitely going to be nervous.
Hopefully everybody will be nice, and even if I make a mistake they'll be like, Yeah, whatever. 
I think it's going to be a fun night.
