Q. First things first, how is the back?
LYDIA KO:   It was great when I woke up this morning.  Then I started playing and started hurting a little bit.  But I think the big key for me is even if it's not feeling 100% tomorrow, it's just for me to go out there and still hit it confidently and aggressively even if the pain is there.
I think when I hit it pretty hard I feel like my body is not flinching over that certain area, so I just got to not worry about it.  Just take a few Advils.  Luckily Chris has been a huge help this week.
Yeah, no, good rest.  Seven years on tour, maybe that's what's happening.
Q. Yeah, all the way up there in those advanced years of your early 20s.  It's no secret that you struggled to the find the course off the tee on the first 8 holes.  What adjustment did you make starting on 9?
LYDIA KO:   I said, you know, it felt like for me I had a tendency when I was practicing back at home that I would be struggling the first few holes, especially off the tee, and then around the turn I would get it back.
I actually told Jason that, funny enough, a couple weeks ago.  I think I just thought in my head, you know what?  I feel like I'm being a little tentative through impact and it's still going wayward, so I'm going to hit it aggressively and it's not going to get much worse.
I hit a really aggressive drive on 9 because it was a little into the wind and I knew that a good one would get up there.  I just continued doing that.  I hit one in the bunker I think on 15 or something, but I really -- there are going to be a couple misses here and there and just not worry about that.  Just swing freely, and I think that's going to a big key for me, not only tomorrow, but really for the rest of my career.
