  THE MODERATOR:   All right.   I'm now joined by Lydia Ko, Rolex Rankings No. 4 player in the world.   Lydia, thanks for coming in today.   Let's talk about your runner‑up finish last week.   You played really well all week.   You had the lead going into the final round.   You didn't come out on top, but you said you learned a ton of lessons.   Just tell us what you took out of that finish last week.  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   Obviously I was hitting really good.   I was really confident all week, and there were a lot of birdie opportunities out there, so I kind of took the most of it.   Yeah, I didn't become the winner at the end of the day, but I came off of the golf course with a lot of positives.  
THE MODERATOR:   Now, you kind of did your homework for this week.   I know you came out here to Aviara a couple of weeks ago and played the course.   Was that your decision to come out and get an early look or how did that decision come into coming out here well in advance of the tournament?   
LYDIA KO:   I was here for some other reasons, and you know, I was in California.   So I thought might as well just come here and have a look at the course.   You know, I heard a lot of good things about it, and I wanted to come out and see.  
And I love coming out to Carlsbad itself.   So it's really nice to come out.  
THE MODERATOR:   You've got new clubs; you've got your sponsor.   How are things going with the transition of all your new stuff and all your new gear?   
LYDIA KO:   It's going good.   I thinks good golf definitely helps that transition.   But they're feeling good.   Obviously they're not perfect.   Nothing's ever really perfect.   So we can always make those little changes, but for now, I think it feels really good.  
THE MODERATOR:   You got a couple of looks at the course.   Talk about course conditions, how this track sets up for your game and what you're looking forward to the most.  
LYDIA KO:   There has been some rain, you know, last night and then the night before, so I think the course is playing slightly wetter, and I think coming off a very desert, dry golf course is definitely going to play different.   
But you know, I think the greens, they're big and elevated, so you really need to hit them at the right places.  
THE MODERATOR:   You have a new caddie on the bag since a couple of weeks ago, Mark.   Talk about your guys' relationship, how he helped you last week.   How's that been going?   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   It was my first week with him.   You kind of learn more about each other, and I guess I know what kind of a caddie he is.   
I will say I don't fully know him right now.   It's only been one week.   I guess it takes a couple of weeks to kind of get to know each other, but he's been a help and I think he's pretty good.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Lydia.   
   
 Q.   You shot up to No. 4 in the world pretty quickly.   When you turned pro, was your goal to become No. 1 or are you just going to let the results take care of that or is that one of your goals, No. 1 in the world?  
LYDIA KO:   It's always been like always my dream to become world No. 1, and that's what everybody strives for, but yeah, there's no rush.   
No, it's kind of like a learning year.   If I play well, you know, hopefully I'll be able to get there at one stage.   But I just want to really enjoy the moment and have fun on the tour right now.  
THE MODERATOR:   The Golf Channel shoot last night, you got all dressed up.   You've been taking part informant photo shoots, all the stuff that comes along with being an LPGA Tour member.   How fun has that been and be able to get to do the fun off course stuff you've embraced, social media and things like that?   
LYDIA KO:   It's been really good.   Like yesterday's shoot is not something you would do like as a normal golfer.   But it was really interesting.   You know, I was holding like the professional signs, like now I'm a professional.   So I guess it's kind of linked to myself.   
   
 Q.   You're looking forward to having a good week here and getting your game tuned up for next week?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   Hopefully my momentum from last week will kind of continue into this week.   Hopefully it will continue into next week.  
But yeah, I just want to take it a week at a time this week.   I'm just going to concentrate on the Kia Classic and next week it's going to be all about the Kraft.   But yeah, I'm really excited to play there again.   I played there last year, so it's much better going into a major knowing the course a little bit better than not knowing at all.   
   
 Q.   Meghan mentioned social media, Lydia.   How do you feel about Twitter and do you like using it?   Is it something you feel that's worth your time?  
LYDIA KO:   I tweet sometimes, but I don't treat every single day.   Lots of comments were you should tweet more often, put some more photos up.   But no, I don't do it all the time.   When I get time or something exciting comes up, I do it.   
But yeah, I mean it's good to kind of get to know your followers and your fans also, so I think having that kind of a social network definitely helps connect you to your fans.  
   
 Q.   You're traveling all around the world now and at age 16 when you go to a place you've never been before, do you explore or kind of stick to the golf course or do you like to explore other countries and cities?  
LYDIA KO:   If I get time, I do like to do something exciting.   A lot of the time‑‑ most of the time I just go from the golf course to the hotel or stores or restaurants, so that's pretty boring.   But no, it would be good to get some time to kind of go to some places, but I think I might do that more next year when I kind of get used to tour stuff and then kind of settle myself in.   
THE MODERATOR:   Any other questions?   All right.   Well, thanks for coming in.   Best of luck this week.
