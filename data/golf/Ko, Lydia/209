Q. What changed today?
LYDIA KO: I wouldn't call it lousy, I just didn't strike the ball very well the last two days and I hit the ball much better today.  I got a few putts to go in.  They weren't very long, but I just played much more solid, and you know, when you play a bogey-free round, especially a course like this, it kind of means I was scrambling well, and I was hitting the ball pretty solid.
So I think that was probably the biggest difference.  It was much hotter today, with the breeze being a little less.  But I think the breeze definitely helps the temperature, but it makes the course tougher.  So in a way it just balances out at the end of the day, but today was definitely hotter.
Q. What have you been working on in your swing with David Leadbetter?
LYDIA KO: We've been trying to keep -- I think during the off-season, our main thought was the lower body, I think being a little bit more stable coming down.  It can get a little active, a little spiny, so we've been trying to get it where I'm loading more towards the left side, and I think that's what was better today than yesterday.
Q. Do you have a game plan for tomorrow's final round?
LYDIA KO: No, not yet.  Hopefully I'll continue the good rhythm from today.  It was good to play alongside two good players like Mi Hyang and Cristie, especially Cristie, she was playing well, and she's a good person to kind of feed off because she's putting well every single round I've played with her.
Hopefully we'll have a similar grouping.  Just give myself a lot of opportunities.  Some of the holes out there are tough, so I've just got to play smart golf, but then when I have the birdie opportunities, grab them.
