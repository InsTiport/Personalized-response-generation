THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone.  We're here with Lydia Ko.  Lydia, a lot made this week about the challenge of the 11th hole.  You had no challenge today.  Talk us through the hole-in-one.   
LYDIA KO: Like I was saying earlier, it's my first time in a press conference when I've just come, like, 50th.  But no, other things to celebrate.   
Yeah, I hit my 6 iron pretty well.  It was kind of drawing a little bit more than I was trying to do, but it was drawing.  And I was like just sit, sit, sit.  All I wanted to do is just like go somewhere on the green or on grass, and it landed on the green.   
There was a pretty big roar, even as soon as it landed on the green, and I was like, oh, they must be happy or excited.  And it was tracking, and I think it almost lipped in.  My putts weren't lipping in, so it's good to see my 6 iron lipping in.   
No, it's exciting.  Started the week, I said, if you shoot even par for all four days on the 11th, you're doing really well, and I think I shot 1 under.  So, yeah, that's the best thing I've done this week.   
THE MODERATOR: And you have a present?   
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I mean, hole-in-one, it means alcohol or celebrate, champagne, beer.  I know there's beer.   
THE MODERATOR: Beer on Lydia in the back.   
LYDIA KO: Beer's on me.  Maybe beer after the tournament because everyone's supposed to be working right now.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.   
 Q.  I work for the local paper here, and I'm just wondering your thoughts on the country club as an Open venue, and would you like to see the USGA come back and all that kind of stuff.  
LYDIA KO: I was talking to a few of the USGA representatives, and I said I really enjoyed my time here at the Country Club of Charleston.  It was my first time here.  I know a few of the players played here for the U.S. Women's Amateur a few years back.   
I thought this was a great representation of golf courses.  Not tricked up, and it's right in front of you, but it can play really tough.  As the week has gone by, the greens have become firmer and faster.  With normal tuck pin positions, I think it's been a great week.   
Obviously, the leaders have yet to start, but I think it's going to be a super exciting day.  Different wind directions, so some players will be able to get on the green on the par 5s.  And the finishing holes are very exciting.   
So, yeah, I thought this was a great venue.  Unfortunately for me, my golf wasn't as great as the fun times I had here.  So, yeah, hopefully we can come back before I retire.   
 Q.  And how have the crowds been compared to other Majors that you've played in?  
LYDIA KO: I think, as the week has gone by, there's been bigger crowds.  With the variety of players at the top of the leaderboard, I think the spectators are going to be pretty big this week.  I think one of the key things was there might have been less people on grandstands, but there were people following certain groups, and I thought that was the cool thing about the pairings on Thursday and Friday, you know, Japanese players played together or players from Boston or Korea or the U.S.  The top players in the world rankings.   
So I thought it was a great mix and a great opportunity for people to come out and watch certain players, and I think that's quite a unique thing, where you see more people stationed at certain areas of the golf course.  Yeah, hopefully, there will be some big crowds.  This is the biggest Major championship.  So, yeah, hopefully it will attract a lot of people today.   
 Q.  How many holes-in-one have you had in competition before?  
LYDIA KO: This was my second, and it's a pretty cool record is that my first one was at the Olympics in Rio, and then my second one is at the U.S. Women's Open.  I'm like maybe I should go for the career Grand Slam holes-in-one or something.  My goal is career grand slam.  But career grand slam hole-in-one, I don't know if anyone's done that.   
No, I was telling Jasmine, my playing partner today, at the Olympics my goal was to not plug it into that front bunker, and it went in the hole.  And today I was like just don't go in any of the bunkers.  Next time I play a par 3, I'm just going to say don't play it in the bunker, and maybe I'll hole it again.  It's a theory.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Lydia.
