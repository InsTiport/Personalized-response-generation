 Q.  Pretty good day on the golf course today, a little different than yesterday.  Tell us how you feel after today.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I mean, the sun is out today, which is a great thing.  It actually warmed up a lot more than I thought throughout this morning.  Yeah, it was overall really solid.  I gave myself a lot of looks for birdies, especially on my back nine, but I just wasn't making many putts.  But hey, I'll take 3-under for the first round.  It was really solid, and hopefully it's good momentum going into tomorrow.  But no, it was fun, and it's great to see the fans kind of join us as we went through to the first hole.   
 Q.  What did you make of yesterday's decision to erase the scores and reduce it to 54 holes?  
LYDIA KO: I mean, you know, like it's something you're just going to have to go with.  Obviously the LPGA and the commissioner and everybody involved, and the sponsors, nobody wants to make it to a 54-hole event, but that's why it was such a tough decision.  But with the weather, it's something that's totally out of your control, and I don't think they were expecting it to be as drastic as it was yesterday.  When that happens, you just have to go with it.  You can't please 100 percent of the people.  I think that's the thing at the end.  But you just have to go with it.  It is what it is.  The weather and those kind of things, the LPGA is doing everything to make it the best for every single player out here, so yeah, you know, you just have to go with the flow, and this is, again, round 1, and just start again.  I think you don't really dwell on, hey, why did we cancel or I wish I could have played.  There are so many scenarios, but at the end, bottom line, the LPGA is doing everything they can to make it the best for every single player, make it fair for every single player.
