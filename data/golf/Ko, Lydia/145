 Q.  Talk about coming back after the rain delay.  
LYDIA KO: 18 is a tough driving hole to come back to after a few hours of break.  But had a pretty okay lie and hit a good shot out of there.  It was a pretty mediocre third shot, but obviously to finish off well with a good putt I think kind of summed up my round today.   
 Q.  Your rounds have been getting progressively better.  Do you feel your game is clicking into gear now?  
LYDIA KO: I've been striking the ball pretty well.  I'm making a few putts here and there but the putts that didn't drop on the first day kind of have been dropping the past two days.  Those little things I think make the difference at the end of the day.  But I've still got one long day tomorrow, so I've just got to stick to the same game plan.   
 Q.  Four back right now, what do you feel you need to do?  
LYDIA KO: The girls are playing great.  Depending on where they put the pin positions, really rely on how low the scores are.  But I've just got to focus on my game.  That's what I tried to do yesterday and today, and that's how I got to this position, so I think I have to do the same thing for tomorrow.
