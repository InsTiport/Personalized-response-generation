 Q.  Tell us about the final three holes.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I hit it close on 16.  It was my first birdie of the day.  I made an eagle earlier on, but it was definitely nice to see one putt drop, no matter how long that putt was.   
And I really wasn't expecting it to go in on 17, because you know, it was a long left-to-right putt, kind of down the hill.  So I was trying to lag it down there.  Ended up lagging in the hole, which is never a bad thing.  It's always nice to end the round with a birdie no matter what you shoot.   
 Q.  How important is patience on a day like this?  It's hot, it's muggy and you look up at the leaderboard and there's someone who is shooting a 7-under round.  How important is patience in situations like this?  
LYDIA KO: I think it's really important.  Especially because I know that I'm striking the ball well enough where I can give myself the opportunities, and at the end of the day, all I can do is turn my best with any club in hand, you know, go from there.  If it ends up falling and going in the hole, great.  If not, there's not much I can do after me hitting the shot.  So I think patience is a big thing, and I tried to stay patient until the end, and it ended up working today.   
 Q.  It seems like you always have a big following but seems like there were a lot of Kiwi fans, as well.  
LYDIA KO: It's always nice to have some hometown fans coming out no matter where in the world I am.  It makes me proud and it's really cool to see them and hear the accents that I have kind of lost.   
 Q.  Can you just talk a little bit about your eagle?  
LYDIA KO: I hit a really good drive down to the end of that little fairway.  I had a really good lie, and because it wasn't actually that windy, it almost was a little easier because you're able to hold the shots coming in.   
I just kind of gripped my 5-wood and ended up being like a foot by the hole.  You know, because the hole was kind of behind this little slope, I didn't know how long it was, because I thought it had kind of gone off the green.   
But ended up being perfect, and yeah, you know, I will definitely take that shot.  That was the shot of the day I think.   
 Q.  How long was the lag putt on 17 that you holed?  
LYDIA KO: It was like 12 yards.
