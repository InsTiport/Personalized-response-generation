 Q.  Is it a little more significant breaking a record that spans all of golf, both men and women?  
LYDIA KO: I think so.  I mean, it's really cool.  I heard that Se Ri Pak is the only person that has won her first two events as both majors, and just to win a major itself is very impressive, but for her first two, I'm sure it's going to be many more to come, normal LPGA events and majors, but no, I think it's very special, and it shows the amount of talent she has.   
I think she's an amazing ambassador for the women's game.  You can kind of see that from her personality.  She's always smiling, and she's there for other people.  I think that's why everybody really likes her, and you can see that by the many of us that came out to support her and celebrate and spray champagne water on her.   
 Q.  Congratulations to you, too.  
LYDIA KO: Thank you.   
 Q.  How much does that mean to you?  
LYDIA KO: It means a lot, especially because coming into this year my goal was to be more consistent in majors, and this exactly is the award for that, and obviously you need a win to have that, and just to have it named after Annika and how successful she's been in majors and just in general and what she's done for the game, I think there might not be some of us if it wasn't for a player like her.   
I think it's very significant, and for her to be here and for her to be able to present the trophy to me I think makes it even more special.  It's something that I could have only really dreamt of and imagined of, and for it to be true in a few moments I think is going to be awesome, and especially for me to stand alongside a legend like Annika.
