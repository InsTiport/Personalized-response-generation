Q.   General overall thoughts about the round. 
LYDIA KO:   It was one of the craziest rounds in my life, and I don't think I should go too much in details about it (laughs).

Q.   So you walk away feeling, dissatisfied? 
LYDIA KO: No, with all the weird things that happened, 2â€‘under is pretty good (laughing).
