  Q. Lydia, what a great round three.  How do you feel?
 LYDIA KO:   I felt like I played pretty solid today.  I had one hiccup of a hole, but other than that I felt like I was able to overcome that and keep playing consistency.
 Hopefully I'll be able to feed off that momentum into tomorrow.
 Q. Speaking of momentum, may I ask when did that start for you >was it the birdie after the double on 6?
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I think it definitely helps when you can come back after a mistake like that.  I hit a great drive and 3-wood just short of the green.  I had a mind fart and hit one of the worst chips, but I was able to hole that putt, so kind of gives you momentum going forward.
 And to make that birdie on 9 which isn't an easy hole location.  So, yeah, I think when I gave myself opportunities I was able to take that opportunity to a birdie, which definitely helps.
 Q. And was there a memorable birdie out there today?  What was the shortest putt for a birdie?
 LYDIA KO:   Probably the shortest putt for birdie was my birdie on 2.  I hit a drive and then a 3-wood to like 20 feet, and then I kind of hit that putt a little hard.  But I had a three-footer and was able to make that.
 Q. Seems like all of your rounds are getting gradually better, starting from round one to three.  May I ask what's the most difficult part of this course?  Does it change every day?
 LYDIA KO:   I think the course is dried out since we played on Tuesday.  The fairways are running out a little bit more.  The greens are a little faster.
 But I think if you can keep it on the fairways and keep it -- some of the greens, because they are getting firm, it's getting a little tougher to get to.
 But I think just have to be confident.  I'm kind of in the behind situation, so hopefully I just be able to stay calm and play my game tomorrow.  Hopefully shoot another good one.
 Q. There were a lot of happy moments today.  I saw you waving to some kids out on 17, the par-3.
 LYDIA KO:   On 8?  Yeah, yeah.
 Q. What are some little things that make you just really relax out there on the course?
 LYDIA KO:   You know, since quarantine we haven't had any fans, so it's nice here, especially on the back nine by the water.  A lot of these people with their boats are coming out and clapping for us.  It's always nice to kind of feel like we're playing in front of crowds again.
 That kid on No. 8, there two kids or three of them, and they were all probably maybe up to my knee height.  They were like, Hello, golfers.  And I was like, Hello, cute kids.
 There was a lot cute kids out here.  I love kids, so it's always nice to see them.  Who knows, we might be seeing them on TV sometime down the road.
 Q. Lastly, what are you going to do ahead of tomorrow's round?  How will you relax and recharge?
 LYDIA KO:   Just going to get some treatment, and then it's actually a pretty long walk around this golf course.  Every day I feel like I've been coming off and my calves have been talking to me like, Hey, you need to rest these.  I think have some good rest and do a little bit of putting and chipping and hit some balls.
 Fortunately for me I'm staying on the golf course, so it makes it easy.  I can rest a little and come back can do some more practice after.
