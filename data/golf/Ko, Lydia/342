Q.   Thoughts on your golf today? 
LYDIA KO:   I struggled with my putting.   I didn't make too many birdies but I hit the ball pretty well, so I couldn't make a complete mess.   I know how wind it can get so it was creating shots.

Q.   How were the shots on putting today? 
LYDIA KO:   It is pretty tricky out here because the greens are quite quick but I wasn't reading the greens that well, so that always does bring birdies.   So I'm going to do some practice and hopefully it will get better tomorrow.

Q.   How were today's conditions on the course?
LYDIA KO:   I think the course is great.   I've never played here before this year but I heard a lot of good things about it.   The greens are perfect.   The fairways are great and the weather is supposed to be nice with the cool breeze. 
The wind makes it harder but I quite like it with the wind.   I know how hard it is with the wind and with the wind it makes it cooler.   So I played the Pro‑Am in the wind. 

Q.   What do you have to do tomorrow?
LYDIA KO:   Just be prepared and have some putting practice today.   I've got three more rounds to go. 

Q.   Your play as the younger generation, how do you feel when you are called the younger generation?
LYDIA KO:   Well, I am not the only young one out here.   I am not the youngest, like this week there is Amanda who is younger than me and there is Lexi who is 19. 
Yeah, it's quite good to be called the young generation, but then when you're out here, you don't really think of yourself as a 16‑year‑old.   You're just out here having fun. 
I've played good this year and the last few tournaments.   Just winning a tournament, that was pretty cool.   It came earlier than I thought.   I've been playing consistently well and I kind of want to continue that for the rest of the season.   It's good and I'm having fun. 

Q.   What is your goal in this season? 
LYDIA KO:   Just enjoy life playing on the Tour.   Yeah, you know, see what it feels like to be a tour player and just having lots of fun out here.   Just enjoying the moment and just enjoying playing on the Tour.
