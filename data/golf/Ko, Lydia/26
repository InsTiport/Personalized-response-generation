Q. We had a little scoring discrepancy in the scoring tent.  Lydia wasn't aware that she shot 5-under on the front.  She thought it was just 4.
Is that a sign of just how focused you are on the process right now?
LYDIA KO:   I got off to a pretty hot streak, and when you're kind of in a good momentum, I think that's when you almost don't realize what you're shooting, and that was the case yesterday as well.
But today I swear coming down the last I thought I was 4-under.  I was like, okay, I want to make one more birdie to finish under par for this nine, but I was apparently 5.
So I'll take the 6-under over the 5 any day.
Q. Paige Mackenzie, our analyst this week, she's been texting back and forth with Sean Foley during the broadcast.  He said his primary goal was to get you back to what feels like it used to feel.
Do you think this is a result this week of that all starting to pay off and you starting to feel like when you were once dominating?
LYDIA KO:   You know, it's hard, because over the time through the experiences you are never the same person.  I think Sean has been helping me to kind of look a lot at my swings from when I was an amateur.  Right now, when I'm on the range I'm not really taking many swing videos.  I say if the ball is doing what it's meant to do, then there is no point in me overanalyzing looking at every little bit.
I think the big key for me is to be aggressive, and this last stretch of holes I thought I hit it really aggressively, especially off the tee.  And then it went out nice, so I think the more I see there is good results, the more confidence it will build.
Hopefully I'll be able to continue doing that and just believing in myself.  I think that's a really big key.
Q. You said it went out nice.  One of your goals was to gain a little bit of distance.  It's object that I have.  Is that part technique or the work outside you've been doing to gain so much more muscle?
LYDIA KO:   You talk to the trainer, they say it's them.  You talk to the swing coach, they say it's them.  You talk to my mom, she says it's the food.
I think it's a combination of things.  I've been working out really hard with my trainers, Damian and Craig.  You know, giving me protein shakes.  I don't drink as many as Bryson DeChambeau, but I think over this time it's been a good time for me to really think through on what are my big goals coming in this year.  We wanted to get more muscle mass, so that was one of our goals.
I think with the swing-wise, the more free you hit it I think the longer it's going to go.  When you're holding on and unsure where it's going to go, that's when I don't hit it as far.
So I think as the confidence builds the distance will kind of come together without me thinking about it too much.
