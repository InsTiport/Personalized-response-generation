Q.   Her first win of 2014, third win overall on the LPGA tour.   She is with Jerry.   She doesn't know exactly what she shot today, which is interesting.   How intense was it out there today, Lydia?
LYDIA KO:   It was just intense the whole way.   I made a couple bogeys on the front nine and then I tried to kind of recover with some birdies.
I still finished my front nine 1‑under par, which I was surprised about that.   At one point I had a two‑shot lead, but then Stacey made a birdie, Jenny made a birdie.
I knew how loud the claps were, so I knew I needed to hit it close and give myself a birdie putt.

Q.   You played with Stacy when you won as a 15 year old your first LPGA win in Canada, and played with her again all four days this week.   What is it about her that brings out your best?
LYDIA KO:   You know, when I just see her play, makes me feel like I need to play good to I guess kind of keep up with her.   She's such a great player and I admire her all the way.   She's just a great player.
Someday I want to become a great player just like her.

Q.   Your father who rarely gets to see you play in competition was here this week.   How much more special does that make your victory?
LYDIA KO:   It makes it really special.   Last year at the Swinging Skirts my sister was there with my mom, and now it's my dad and my mom.   Hopefully one day the whole family will be there.   No, it's really special to have them here. 
Also him caddying last week, he kind of knew how tough it is to play good, I guess.   Yeah, I hope he's proud of it. 

Q.   Pretty special belated birthday present.   Congratulations. 
LYDIA KO:   Thank you.
