 Q.   Just take us through your round.   You had a nice recovery after the two bogeys.   Talk about that stretch?   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, you know, I didn't have the best start.   I got a ruling on the 10th which was my first hole and made bogey on 11.   Yeah, it was kind of not the start that I wanted to, but I made two birdies in a row then in the middle of my first.   Then I made some more bogeys on the back nine, and then I made two birdies in a row again.   So, yeah, I think today I made birdie was two in a row.  
   
 Q.   You said you didn't get off to a birdie start, so you probably weren't that worried?   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I wasn't that worried.   I don't really like a birdie start, but if I get it, I won't say anything about it because birdie is obviously not a bad thing.  
   
 Q.   Putting like you've done over the round, but you got it back by the end; what was the change for you?   
LYDIA KO:   You know, I was putting well.   On my front nine, I did miss some putts.   Then I missed a short putt and in the middle of my back nine, but I kind of got my confidence back after making a birdie and coming off a bogey.  
   
 Q.   Talk about where you're situated on the leaderboard, and what you'll have to do to track down the likes of Inbee Park?   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, Inbee shot an amazing score, 6‑under, I think, today.   So, yeah, she's obviously right now the one to catch.   
But I've just got to play my own game, and hopefully get some more putts rolling in and reduce some bogies because I had a couple silly bogeys out there today.  
   
 Q.   It's nice when your mediocre round is 69.   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I know.   I mean 1‑under at 69, I wouldn't have thought that.   But, yeah, it could have been worse.  
   
 Q.   Does this feel like Vancouver?   What are the parallels from last year to this year?   
LYDIA KO:   I had a pretty average round in the third round last year.   I was okay.   I was still a shot leading going into the last round.   I guess it's a whole different feeling because I know I've already won it, so I think it gives me more pressure thinking I actually can do it.   But at that time I was thinking no way I'm going to win it anyways, so, yeah.  
   
 Q.   I've never opened a round with a birdie.   What's not to like about that?   
LYDIA KO:   I usually go and play really low like I did yesterday.   That happened to me in Hawaii.   I had a birdie on the first hole and I shot 6‑under.   But then, if not, I kind of have a mediocre round, even.   It's never really been better than even unless I shoot something like 65‑under.  
   
 Q.   Is there one hole on this course that's more troublesome than the others?   
LYDIA KO:   No, I don't think so.   I don't think there wasn't a bogey that I made yesterday and I did it again today.   So obviously some of the driving holes are quite hard because it sometimes gets me a little.   But, obviously, the golf course wasn't made for you to shoot 10‑under or something like that.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about your caddie.   I know you mentioned earlier in the week you have been using local caddies whenever you traveled around.   Talk about how Bruce has helped you this week and just the process that you go through getting to know your caddies and how much they've helped you?   
LYDIA KO:   You know, like the last couple of caddies, local caddies, we've kind of done club selection and stuff together, but this time I decided I wanted to make the decision so Bruce doesn't know what club I'm hitting.   Yeah, he's most of the time helping if the breeze gets up or looking at the slopes of the green.   
The only different thing about the other local caddies is I was actually sharing what club to hit, and sometimes it was good and sometimes it wasn't.   So I've decided I wanted to be more independent.   Doing it this way, it actually helps me to learn to know my clubs better, so I think that's a really good opportunity that way.
