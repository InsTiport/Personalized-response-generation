Q.   Another good round today; 67. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, you know what?   Yeah, I had two solid rounds.   I thought I played pretty solid today and yesterday. 
Hopefully I can continue that through the weekend.

Q.   Course play differently today?
LYDIA KO:   No, I don't think so.   The course condition itself is in really good condition.   I don't think it played that differently.
Other than I think the wind direction was opposite way. 

Q.   Are you as calm and composed out there as you seem to be?
LYDIA KO:   No, I try.   I try and be calm.   You know, that's what you have to do.   Just I guess being overly happy or overly angry, that's not going to help me.   That's what I think, so I try and stay calm.

Q.   What do you need to do to keep this going through Sunday?
LYDIA KO:   Hopefully I can hit the ball like I did today and make some putts.   If I play like I did the last few days, I think I'll be in a good position. 

Q.   Is it easier in the morning than the afternoon? 
LYDIA KO:   Well, yesterday the wind in the afternoon, it didn't get I guess more windier by us playing in the afternoon.   I don't know what it will be like today. 
But, no, I think there wasn't much wind the last few days.   It was fun just playing.
