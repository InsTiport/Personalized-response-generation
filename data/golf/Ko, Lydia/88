 Q.  Opening round of 64 and a couple of twos on the scorecard coming in?  
LYDIA KO: It's always nice to make birdies on par 3s.  Birdies on any holes, you take it.  I feel like 17 is kind of a lucky one.  It was a really solid day for me, so I'll take my 64.   
 Q.  When we look at your scores, this is your best opening round of 2017?  
LYDIA KO: I guess you never really know, because when you're out there, you never think about, hey, what's my lowest round and all that.  When you're out there playing, you're just trying to make as many birdies as you can and be in a good rhythm.   
I think playing well on the weekend last week really helped me coming into this week.  I tried to stay positive, and every shot I hit, I tried to commit to it.   
 Q.  Is there anything in particular that you think is really clicking for you?  
LYDIA KO: I was making putts today.  If you're not striking the ball very well, but you're able to make putts when you get birdie opportunities or to make those crucial par putts, those are going to be the three- or four-shot swing.   
To me, it's really about confidence and momentum, where if I see some going in the right direction.   
 Q.  The siren has gone and you're now safely the in clubhouse.  You must feel very comfortable?  
LYDIA KO: After nine holes it was getting a little dark out, so I was wondering if we were going to be able to play many holes after that.  Thank goodness we were able to finish 18, and it's perfect timing.  Maybe we get some lunch and see if it comes down a bit, maybe do a bit of putting.
