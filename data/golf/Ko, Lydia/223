 Q.  Your feelings right now as you're about to turn around real quick?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, this morning was obviously much better than yesterday morning in that sense, but it was good.  Our group made quite a few birdies along the way.  I think we're all in pretty good rhythm.  But no, it was definitely good to start with a birdie on the first hole that I came out, and when you kind of start on that, you feel like you're going to get into a good rhythm for the rest of the day.   
 Q.  Your second shot right here was off a pine cone?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, obviously had to stick next to the pine cone, but maybe it was a lucky pine cone and I need to take it along with me the rest of the 18 holes.  But you have to play with what you get, especially even if I did move it there's a chance of the ball moving, so you don't really want to mess with anything that could get worse.  But I made a good birdie, and on the tee I was thinking that the first day I hit it in the trees and then made birdie and yesterday I hit it in the middle of the fairway and made par, so maybe that's the way it goes.   
 Q.  Knowing that today is such a marathon, did you sleep well?  Did you go to bed at like 9:00?  How did you get prepared?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I normally like nine hours of sleep, but obviously that was impossible unless I went to bed straight from the course.  But I went to bed around like 9:00, so had like seven and a half hours of sleep, got treatment afterwards, after the round yesterday, and came out here maybe half an hour later than what I normally would, and especially because it's so cold in the morning you don't really want to be out here trying to hit a lot of balls.  I changed up my routine a little bit so I hit range balls last so it would be closest to warming up when I got to the tee.
