 Q.   Another round under par, and I've got to say that's now 26 rounds under par on the LPGA Tour.   The record is 29, held by Annika Sorenstam.   At what point in your career do you start to think, I'm going to break these records or I want to set a new mark for players to beat?  
LYDIA KO:   I didn't know that the record was 29 until I saw it on Twitter, and I heard Tom talking about it.   That's the only time I knew.   But to have a record that's already set by a legendary player like Annika, it's pretty awesome that I'm like only three rounds away.   But like I said, I'm going to try and take one round at a time.   This is a tough course, so hopefully I can get over it with this week.   
   
 Q.   Many people talk about you having the opportunity to break not just this record but a whole load of other records.   What other record would you like to win?   
LYDIA KO:   I don't know.   I don't know all the records and all the details on that, but yeah, you know, like I always say, I'm going to try and have fun, and if I play good golf and kind of broke some records, great.   I think the big one everyone is talking about is probably the major, trying to become the youngest one.   But I always say I want to play really consistent in these majors and just get more comfortable playing in them.
