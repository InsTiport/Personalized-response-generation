Q.   It's very wet, obviously, started pouring down on you guys.   What happened? 
LYDIA KO:   We hit a drive on 18, which was the 9th hole for the day, and just before Jessica hit, it started pouring.   We decided to wait a little bit, but then the horn blew, so we came in, waited for, what, an hour or so, and apparently there's still more coming.   Hopefully everything will be cleared up by tomorrow morning, but it was good.   I didn't wear any glasses so I didn't have to wipe anything. 

Q.   How are the contacts, good?
LYDIA KO:   They're good, no problems.   You know, it was good.   It was good that I was like, man, I've got nothing.   There's nothing in my way.   I didn't mind the rain.   It was a good test. 

Q.   Jason's bib, very exciting.   Did he joke about it at all because I know he got some TV time. 
LYDIA KO:   I mean, he had the green bib with Yani before, so he's used to it more than me.   But that was really cool.   It was in this black, very professional little case.   You know, it was really cool, and it was great that the commish could present it to Jason.   A very special moment. 

Q.   Are you through nine holes?   Did you finish 18?
LYDIA KO:   No, we haven't finished. 

Q.   Through eight holes, 1‑under.   Do you feel good?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, we've still got 10 more holes, and I know there are birdie opportunities.   18th is a par‑5, too.   We've just got to stay patient, and hopefully I will make a couple more birdies down the stretch.
