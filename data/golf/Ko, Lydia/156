 Q.  Did it feel good to bounce back immediately from your first hole with two straight birdies after?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I mean it was a little bit of a silly mistake, but then at the same time I got unlucky, I hit it out of the bunker, but ended up being in the bunker, but it kind of came off the hill and half plugged.  So it was a bad shot, and not the greatest luck, and on 18 I hit it a bit short, and it plugged in the bunker, and on 17 I landed in the mound and kicked left into the trees.  So it wasn't the greatest luck day.  But you know, I putted much better today, so it was good to see some putts go in, and without the putter I don't think I would have been able to shoot even par.  So definitely good to bring myself to even par for the day, considering how up-and-down it was.   
 Q.  How did the course play out there today?  Some of the challenges yesterday, was it different today or was it similar?  
LYDIA KO: The wind direction was pretty similar, so wind wise it wasn't really much different.  I guess it was a little calmer this morning compared to the afternoon, but I think we all kind of expect it to be a little calmer in the mornings than the afternoons.  But yeah, no, I didn't feel like it played a lot differently.  Depending on the pin positions, I know some pin positions you can't go for it as much as others.  So I think it all depends on how they set it up.  But course wise it wasn't that different.   
 Q.  Minus two going into the weekend, what's your feeling, what's your focus the next couple of days?  
LYDIA KO: It's good to see me rolling the putts better.  I feel I have some sort of confidence back.  At the end of the day it's about confidence and patience out there.  So I just gotta be confident with the shots going in and just put some good strokes on the putts.   
 Q.  You've said that coming to Canada is almost like coming home.  When did that start?  
LYDIA KO: I just feel like the atmosphere feels a lot like New Zealand to me, and it's not, you know, like the vibe and the views, and wherever we play in Canada, it's pretty beautiful, and even last week in Calgary, too.  So just I love coming here, and even this week I've seen a lot of Kiwis out here that now have moved over here.  So it's always good to see people from home coming out to support me.   
 Q.  Canadian fans are obviously pretty happy to see you.  They treat you pretty well.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  They've been really supportive, and whether I play bad or good, they're always behind me, and that's always a good feeling where they're excited to see me play well.  And I think because of that, you know, I do want to play some good golf so that they get to see a great show.
