LYDIA KO: I started off really well and I gave myself good opportunities on 1, 2, 3, 4.  I was able to make birdies on 1 and 2 and then I just kind of peeked at the leaderboard and saw Inbee was making a lot of birdies.  Inbee doing her Inbee things; I knew that I needed to focus up until the last moment and fortunately I made some birdies down the stretch which really helped today.   
 Q.  What does this do for your confidence heading into the season's first major?  
LYDIA KO: You know, a lot of confidence, but like I said, who knows what's going to happen tomorrow.  But I've been playing consistently well so I'm really happy with that and it's just good to see the hard work we've put in the off-season.   
All the work we've put in as a team kind of paid off.  Yeah, a really happy moment, but I have to focus for next week and I'm really excited to go back to ANA.
