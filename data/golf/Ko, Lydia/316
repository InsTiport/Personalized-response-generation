Q.   Thoughts on your round today?
LYDIA KO:   I think I played pretty good.   2‑under to start at a major is, I think, pretty solid start.

Q.   What did you make of the course?   I know you had a few chances at the pro am.   Differences maybe today?
LYDIA KO:   I think it was playing a little drier than the pro am did and the practice days, with it not raining last night, that was quite key, and yeah, I mean the course was playing slightly shorter than what it was the last couple of days.

Q.   What's the key on Friday around here to move forward and try and make your move?
LYDIA KO:   I'm not really sure what the pin positions and everything is going to be, but I guess just have to hit good shots for all different clubs, you know, drivers and the hybrids and wedges.   So just have to, I guess, play my way through, and if I play like I did today, I think I'll be in good position.

Q.   I read you have a superstition that if you're playing well on the green, you don't want to see a ball marker.   Did that continue today?
LYDIA KO:   I even forgot to bring my ball marker today, so I had to actually borrow a quarter from another caddie.   So that wasn't a really good start, but I putted pretty good, so maybe I won't give the quarterback to him.

Q.   Not the best start, but good finish.   How do you build on that?
LYDIA KO:   My Front 9‑‑ well, the Back 9 was‑‑ I played pretty good and I came off 2‑under on that nine, and to me that nine is a little tougher, so yeah, I think overall I played pretty solid.

Q.   A lot of golfers took advantage of the 14th hole, birdieing, even I think some eagles.   What were your thoughts on that hole?
LYDIA KO:   You know, especially with the longer hitters you can hit some hybrids and woods into there, and I made a birdie myself there.   You kind of have to come off that hole with a birdie or better.
