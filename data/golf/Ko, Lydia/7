  Q. You came, you battled it out on your home course and an excellent finish.  Take us through the last four days for you.
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, obviously on Thursday it was probably the best start I could for my season overall.  I think overall I felt like I played really solid.
 Today I drove it so well, and then my ball-striking wasn't there, and then when I did hit it close, I didn't hole many.  I was able to get a few in a row, and I think I was just more excited that I had most improved on No. 12 today from a 6 to a 3.  But yeah, it was great to play in front of our home crowds, and I think the members all were super excited for us to be here, and it was so great to play in front of some familiar faces.
 Q. Four birdies in a row on your back nine; what kind of confidence boost does that give you going into next week?
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, it was just a confidence boost for the day.  I had my first birdie, and I was like, yay, actually birdies are possible because when you keep not seeing it happen, you feel like, man, it's just not going to happen, period.  But I hit a good shot in there and I took advantage of that opportunity.
 13 was I think a really good birdie.  It was a pin that was tough to get to, so when you just see things go in, I think you keep visualizing and seeing and feel that you're going to hole the next one, and I think I kind of took that momentum and took advantage of the two shorter holes in the middle of the back nine.
 Q. You became No. 1 in the world at Golden Ocala.  What do you remember about --
 LYDIA KO:   Oh, yeah.  I know I played really well.  I had not-so-good finishes both final rounds.  The two times I played there I think both I had chances to win.  But I think I came second or something, and I still became the No. 1 player, and I remember more like playing in the Bahamas as the No. 1 ranked player.  So a lot of good memories.  I know that they have some signature holes, holes similar to other golf courses, so that's probably the cool characteristics of that course.
 Hopefully I'll be able to feed on some good momentum from this week, and every day is a new day, so we'll see what happens.
