Q.   Another great week, great playing out there.   Four weeks in Asia, three Topâ€‘10 finishes, what does that do for your momentum with the last two events of the year? 
LYDIA KO:   I think I played really well here in Asia.   Obviously there were a lot of great memories made, and, yeah, I just enjoyed my time playing over here in Asia.   I didn't get many opportunities to play out here before, so it was great to come back, like to this week, where I've won before. 
I've enjoyed it and I'm excited for a week off next week and kind of get back into it for the last two.

Q.   What are your plans for that week off? 
LYDIA KO:   I've actually got some outings the next couple days, so I'll do that, go home, just chill out.   I'll probably not come out of the house for a day or so.

Q.   And then finally, you're in a good position for the race to CME.   What would that mean to you to win the first one of those and the million dollars? 
LYDIA KO:   That would be pretty awesome, being the first one to be able to do that.   But, you know, everyone is playing great and all I can do is just try my best.   There's still three more events on the Tour, so you just never know until the end.
