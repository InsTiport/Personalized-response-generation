Q. You came into this morning knowing you needed to make a move.  That's exactly what you did.  You start off slow with a bogey, and how did you get it started, turned around?
LYDIA KO: It was a very slow start, missed the fairway on 1 and then with the pin being tucked on the left, it was the worst miss to have.  But I made a really good birdie on 3 and the string of birdies from 3 to, I think, 6 definitely made the round turn around.
Q. You added a couple more birdies after that.  We'll take some looks at the highlights.  Some amazing approach shots for you today.
LYDIA KO: I actually send it a little bit here, so I my caddie was saying good thing I cleaned the grooves.  I didn't even know it rolled back.
Q. Surprised?
LYDIA KO: It ended up being good.  Nice tap-in birdie.
This one drew a little bit.  But there's a little hill just left of the pin.  So I got the member's bounce and ended up being 15 feet above the hole and went in the hole.
Q. Did you play some different tees today on that hole?
LYDIA KO: We played the tee forward, so that definitely made it a little easier.  With the wind being down yesterday and today, made it a lot easier than.
Q. Here is for your third birdie in a row at the par-4 5th hole?
LYDIA KO: I kind of remember this hole.  It feels like a long time ago.  I was putting it well today, and I think that definitely helped all day.
Q. You didn't stop there.  Here we are at 11.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, it was playing quite short today with the wind being down, so I took advantage of that.
Q. Then at the last, you punctuated this finish?
LYDIA KO: It's always good to end up with a birdie.  But it was the best place to leave for that pin position.
Q. How much does your major championship experience play now that you're trying to capture your first U.S. Open?
LYDIA KO: I think the more I play, I think the more I get used to it, especially at these majors where the courses are tough.  You need to stay patient.  I think that's the big key I've been learning, just keep my head high and just enjoy it out here.
