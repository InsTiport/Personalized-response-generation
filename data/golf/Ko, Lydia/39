  Q. Lydia Ko standing in front of the protocol microphone here; I think she feels like she's practicing her standup comedy routine.  The golf game today wasn't comedy, though.  Was it a difference of just making more putts than last week perhaps?
 LYDIA KO:   Well, I had like four or five really tap-in putts where they're stress-free and not even reading putt.  You just walk up there and hole it.
 I had almost like few too many were Amy Olson said at one pint, Hey, at one point one these shots are going to go in the hole.
 No, aside of that, it's nice that you can walk up to a few of these greens and you know that when you're on the green you've got good looks at birdies.
 No, nice to start this week on a high note.
 Q. How much confidence do you gather when you walk on the property here at Highland Meadows with two wins previously and today being your career low?
 LYDIA KO:   It's always nice to come back here.  I think at any event when you know you've played well at that course before, gives you confidence and you draw back a lot of the good memories.
 I tried to just play my own game today and give myself good looks for birdies.  When I'm kind of out of position, be smart.  I actually got pretty lucky in some cases, so I think it was kind of one of those days where it's kind of clicking.
 So, yeah, I feel very relieved with the way it went.
