Q. How do you think the 2019 season has gone so far?  Number of Top 10s.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, apart from the Australian Open it's actually been pretty solid results-wise.  I always love going Australia.
No, it's been pretty solid.  I think the more times I put myself in contention and solid rounds, I know that builds the confidence.  I think confidence is so important for any player, but I've noticed it's really important for me.  I just go out there playing with belief, and I think that's such a big key on playing well and just trusting yourself.
Q. How special is it being here as a past champion?
LYDIA KO: It's definitely nice to be back.  Obviously a lot of good memories jumping into Poppy's Pond in 2016.  This is a special place.  You could say it's like the Masters of the women's game.  We've got tradition that maybe even the Masters don't have.
So, yeah, no, I think this is incredible.  I love coming back here.  I think the champion's dinner is also a great representation of this event, including both the junior inspiration golfers and the legends and everyone that's won here, and also a Founder who was present last night.
So, yeah, I think they do a great job with this event.  No matter how I play, I always enjoy coming out to sunny California.
Q. Anything you've been working on?  How is your game shaping up this week?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I had two pretty solid finishes the last couple weeks.  Definitely nice to come in with a couple good results.  Every week is different.  All three the course setup is very different.  It's really hard to compare.
With how the course is playing this week, the fairways are pretty tight, so I think driving consistency is going to be a big key for any player this week.
