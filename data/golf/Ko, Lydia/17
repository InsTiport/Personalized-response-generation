  Q. Nice Top 5.
 LYDIA KO:   Thank you.
 Q. How did it feel to put that performance together this week?
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, you know, I wasn't really getting anything out there like today on the front nine, but definitely nice to be able to finish strong on the back.
 No, I found how tricky this golf course is, especially with it being firm and windy.  But I really enjoyed my experience here, and looking forward to coming back over the next few years.
 Q. Was a little different out there today.  Seemed like maybe a little less wind.
 LYDIA KO:   Less wind and the wind direction changed for us during the middle of our round.  18 was -- the max club I hit was 8-iron all week, and on the last day I hit a hybrid.
 So I think that the wind direction and the wind strength obviously plays a huge factor.  But even though it wasn't as windy, I think because the greens have progressively gotten firmer, it's still pretty tough out there.
 Q. Last one I have for you:  The tournament this week donated $50 for every birdie that was made to the BayCare Hospital Foundation here.  What's it like to have a tournament sponsor that does that and to be able to help with that with some birdies that you made this week?
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I know like this is a pretty tough time in the world, and for them to host a tournament itself for us is -- I know it wouldn't have been easy.
 For them to do that and donate $50 for every birdie, you know, it just shows how passionate they are and how much they want to show support.
 It's always cool that we made a bit of a contribution.  Maybe, I don't know, if it's going to be a tradition going down the road for them, but I think it just shows what an amazing sponsor and how genuine they are.
