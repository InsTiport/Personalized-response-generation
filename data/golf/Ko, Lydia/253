Quick Quotes From:   
LYDIA KO   
 Q.  New leg accessory.  
LYDIA KO: No.  Like yesterday I was walking down the par-3 14th, and on the cup there's this little metal stump that is on there, and it's really small, and I didn't look, and I stepped on it and just rolled my ankle.  It's better than it looks.   
 Q.  Did you feel it at all today while you were playing?  
LYDIA KO: I mean it's kind of bothering me, but it's not pain.  You know, I just know that I did kind of roll it.  But it's not painful, and you know, it doesn't affect me when I'm hitting the ball.   
 Q.  You don't have to get treatment or anything, do you?  
LYDIA KO: Well, I get treatment anyway.  So you know, just get it worked on.  But you know, I'm sure it'll progress in the right direction.   
 Q.  What did you think of your day?  
LYDIA KO: I mean it's kind of disappointing to finish with a bogey, but you know, it was an up-and-down day.  I didn't really have a good front nine, but I came up with some good birdies in the end.  So yeah, I just gotta take the positives and just have a good weekend.   
 Q.  Did you feel like without that bogey, though, you got some good momentum heading into the weekend?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I played the last couple really well.  Kind of playing it good.  And yeah, I think I have to take a shot at a time because it's not the most perfect greens.  You just gotta be confident in your stroke and everything else, and that's all you can do.
