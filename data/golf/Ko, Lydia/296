 Q.   It's funny how you're making golf look really easy right now.  
LYDIA KO:   I mean it's not easy, and I'm trying to take one round at a time, one shot at a time, and that kind of breaks it up a little bit.   
Yeah, you know, it's tough.   And playing weeks back to back and all courses just being different, I think that's the hard thing, but I'm just trying to keep focused, but I know that I've played well the last couple of events.   It's always good to know that you're playing out there and you can be confident.  
   
 Q.   You had a good group today.   Do you play off the other people that you're playing with in your group?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, Karlin and Anna, you know, it's the first time that I've played in a tournament round with Karlin.   I've played with Anna a couple of times this year, and yeah, you know, they are both great players, so it's always good when you're in that kind of group and everybody is hitting good shots into the greens.  
   
 Q.   What about being on top of the leaderboard?   Do you like where you're at, and going into tomorrow?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   The girl that's leading, I think, Hyo Joo, she's still got a couple of holes to go.   And I left some birdie putts out there the last couple of holes, so she could drop some and she could end up at 7‑under, or who knows.   Yeah, I know that especially with this wind direction, some holes can play a little shorter and it can become I guess a bit of an advantage, but I know that I've shot a good score and I'm happy to where I finished today.  
   
 Q.   Can you go through the lengths of your birdie putts, please?  
LYDIA KO:   The first one was like 24 feet.   Next one‑‑  
   
 Q.   Which hole?  
LYDIA KO:   Do you have them?   
   
 Q.   It's hard when you start on 10.  
LYDIA KO:   13, I think is my first one.   That was 24 feet.   And then the next one was 16, that was 36 feet.   The next one was 3 and that was like nine feet.   5 was like two‑and‑a‑half, three feet, and 7 was seven feet.  
   
 Q.   So the first two were pretty long putts.  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, the first two I wasn't hitting as close, and the first couple of holes I kind of misjudged because of I guess of how cool it was, I was leaving a lot of my shots into the green short.   So I wasn't hitting it as close, but I was able to hole some good putts.  
   
 Q.   Is it hard to hole those 24 and 30‑whatever‑footers out here because of the slopes?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, even six‑footers, three‑footers are tough because‑‑ I mean that's the case with every course, but here you just have these subtle breaks everywhere, and you know, sometimes you think it's right edge and you play a little firm, and it just stays out there.   
So yeah, I mean just overall it's not the flat greens so you really gotta take every putt carefully.  
   
 Q.   Because of the poa annua, is it an advantage putting in the morning and pretty early?  
LYDIA KO:   It's not an advantage because somebody‑‑ all players are going to play in the morning at least once.  
   
 Q.   Sure.  
LYDIA KO:   So you know, it's good that I started off well, in the morning.   I knew that the greens were going to be much smoother, so in a way that I got myself in a good rhythm, that could stay as an advantage, but it's going to be like that tomorrow, and I feel like the greens are a little faster than last year, so I don't think it's going to be a big deal.  
   
 Q.   How many greens did you hit last year do you think?  
LYDIA KO:   Around 15.  
   
 Q.   And what was your closest bogey?  
LYDIA KO:   Probably on 17, I left my third one short right in the rough, and I had like an 11‑footer for par and I made it.  
   
 Q.   And you made that.   Just the momentum that you've continued to have, are you in the same kind of mindset?   Is it a comfortable mindset, I guess, at this point right now?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, you know, it's good that I'm playing all these events I didn't play so well last year.   But you know, I play well in the mornings.   It's good to know that I'm coming in with a lot of confidence and that my game is there.   
So yeah, you know, it's just‑‑ it's always good to know that you can be aggressive and just to trust myself.  
   
 Q.   To keep so many rounds under par do you think about that?   I mean you've got a pretty amazing streak going right now.  
LYDIA KO:   I didn't know.   You know, you don't know because at the end of the day it's just you're talking about that round and that tournament and how well you finished, but I guess it's been pretty good and I've been playing pretty solid the last couple of weeks, especially when we went down under, Australian, New Zealand to Singapore.   So yeah, you know, it's a pretty cool streak, but just never know, and I'm not going to be counting.  
   
 Q.   Your goal coming into the year, was it to win a major?  
LYDIA KO:   Was it?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   Do you think?  
LYDIA KO:   No.   I think my major goal is to play more consistent.   You know, I had two Top 10s last year, won the year before, so I know I'm feeling a little bit more confident.   But at the back of my head I know it's a major, major, major, and everybody prepares so much for the majors, so yeah, I'm just going to try and take it as another event.   Hopefully I'll have a good week here and I'll be in a good rhythm for next week.   But yeah, no, I can't believe it's already a major.  
   
 Q.   You seem really mentally strong, especially for an athlete, but also a 17‑year‑old.   Those kind of things don't really creep in your head, do they?   It's just not something that you ever think about?  
LYDIA KO:   I do think about it, and sometimes, you know, what we've been trying to work on is trying to not over complicate anything.   It's just try and go simple.   Like David said the other day, he will worry about my swing, so I shouldn't worry.   He's just trying to keep it simple and even Ron Stockton and Dave said always keep it simple and said think about nothing.  
So yeah, sometimes I know that I can over complicate things, and that's when a lot of thoughts go in.   So even with my shot execution I'm trying to do it quicker so that there's no devil saying what if you do this, what if you do that.
