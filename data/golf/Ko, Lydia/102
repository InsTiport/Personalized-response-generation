Q. Looks like you had a great round today.  Can you just sum up what was going well for you.
LYDIA KO: You know, it was really tough out there with the wind action being opposite to what we've played the last couple days.  I thought the forecast said it was going to be light breeze.  If this is light breeze, I don't know what windy is.
But, no, I tried to stay strong until the end.  With the 18th play a little differently to how we've played the last couple days I think it was nice.  Nice for the fans to see a lot of birdies.  I think the strong finish will definitely give me good momentum going into tomorrow.
Q. It's been a while since your last win.  How are you preparing heading into tomorrow in contention?
LYDIA KO: I just got to focus on my game.  The girls are playing great.  I think Lexi is leading right now and she's confident.  I haven't been able to play with her, but I heard she's hitting her drives well.  And especially when she's hitting her drives well and that long, it's a huge advantage.
So I am just going to concentrate on my game tomorrow and do the best I can, and hopefully make a bunch of birdies.
Q. Ball striking where you want it right now?
LYDIA KO: I was actually hitting the ball pretty good today.  When I did miss it I missed it in the wrong spots.  It was really tough for me to make up and down in those certain areas I did miss it on.
But overall I thought it felt better today than yesterday.  That's always good when day by day you feel like it's a little better.
Q. One of the tendencies players have then they might be feeling like they struggle a little bit with their putting is going at flags you wouldn't ordinarily go for.  Do you sense you may've done that a time or two?
LYDIA KO: You know, I'm not a long hitter, and especially when the greens are as firm as right now, it's tough to be able to go at every single pin.
But considering what position I'm in, I don't know exactly how many shots behind I am and the leaders are still yet to finish, I think I will need to make a bunch of birdies.
In some cases I might need to be a little bit more aggressive in some positions.  But at the end, I just got to focus on that one shot at the time.  Sometimes being too aggressive might lead to a mistake.
So you just have to be smart out here.  When you do get the birdie opportunities, try and hole it.
