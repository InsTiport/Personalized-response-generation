 Q.  Talk about your experience playing here for the past week and what it's been like?  LYDIA KO: It's been a lot of fun.  U.S. Open is a tournament where we all look forward to having a great week.  We hope that our game is right at the peak.  It would have been great to cut a couple more shots off, but you can say that at every tournament unless you are the winner.  It's been a lot of fun. I think the fans were fantastic.  We had a big crowd even on the practice days.  You can see here people are everywhere.  I think it's great that people are not only supporting the leaders but everyone in the field.   Q.  Would you want to play again at this course?  LYDIA KO: Yeah, I think so.  I think it was a great week.  Gave us a couple birdies along the way, and gave us trouble to.  It's a great week.  Hopefully -- I don't know when we might be back, but hopefully we will be back..
