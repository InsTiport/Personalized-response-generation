Q. How does it feel to win the Silver Medal here at the Olympic Games? 
LYDIA KO: I mean, going into today, I knew that there were so many girls that were packed at the top of the leaderboard, so you just never knew. I didn't have a great start, but I just tried to keep and hang in there. I can't believe I'm going to hold a medal on the podium, and it's what I've been dreaming about since 2009. To actually be there besides Inbee and Shanshan, I think this is a dream come true. 
Yeah, this has been just an amazing week.

Q. The final hole was crucial, you made a birdie putt of about six, seven feet; is that right? 
LYDIA KO: I kind of had to look at the leaderboard. At one stage I was fifth, and I said, okay, I've got a lot of work to do. But it was a really good finish, and no matter what the result is, when you're finishing off with a birdie where there's the most crowds, it's a great feeling.

Q. How did it feel to get that birdie putt in on the last for the silver? 
LYDIA KO: My celebration was like as if I won the gold. But you know, just any putt‑‑ I wasn't putting very great today, so just to see something go in I think was really cool because now there's no playoff, I think it's great. It's pretty cool. Nobody would have imagined that both men's and women's would have finished with no playoff.
