Q. Tough day out there?LYDIA KO: Yeah, I mean, the front nine was okay.  I just made a double and just couldn't get anything turned around.  They are one of the tougher holes you play.  I just kind of made bogey after bogey and when you do that, it's not great. But yeah, I tried to finish strong.  I made two good putts the last two holes.  It was already kind of too late.Q. I know you had set your focus on the majors.  Does that make this kind of especially disappointing to miss the cut?LYDIA KO: Yeah, I really like this course.  Just because I missed the cut doesn't mean it's not a course I don't like.  The greens and everything were in great conditions.  So yeah, hopefully the rest of the girls will have a good weekend.Q. Is there any positives that you took out of your game this week that you're going to use moving forward?LYDIA KO: I missed a lot of 9-footers today.  So they weren't good.  But I feel like I made a good putter change.  I know I holed a lot of good putts yesterday.  So, yeah, I'm glad that I've got a putter in my hand where I'm confident with it.
