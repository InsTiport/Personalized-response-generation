Q. Lydia, did you ever think you would come up 18 at 22-under and not have a shot to win?  What was that feeling like?
LYDIA KO: You know, I don't know.  I started the week pretty slowly with the 2-under par, and you feel like around this course 4-under is like even par.  And I said I wanted to give myself a good run for it, and I kind of looked at the scoreboard on 13 green, 14.  I was like, wow, Sei Young is already 24 and I'm 19.  So I knew I needed to make a lot of birdies, and I knew the girls at the top of the leaderboard were making a lot of birdies themselves.
So when it's kind of a birdie fest, you know you need to try and somehow make one more birdie and do that a couple of times, especially when you're starting from behind.  But it's been a good last three days and I'm pretty proud with the way I played, especially on the weekends.
And congratulations to Sei Young.  There's not that many times when you shoot 7-under on the last day, only a few groups behind and still finished like five behind.
Q. Yeah, tee to green you mentioned on the weekend ball striking, putting was really solid.  You're going to Kia where birdies aren't as easy to come by.  What kind of confidence does that give you?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, you know, Kia is a little bit of a different course.  There's quite a few tough holes where if you come up with pars, that's a job well done.  So it's a whole new week.  I'm going to prepare myself and hopefully have another good week there, but there's a lot of positives to take from this week.
