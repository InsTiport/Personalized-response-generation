Q.   Talk about starting with a 4‑under par 68?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, started off well with a birdie.   Whenever I have a birdie on the first hole, I kind of wonder what kind of day it will be.   But ended up being pretty good, and I think it's my best score around this course.

Q.   How are you feeling at the moment?   Some serious golf the last few weeks, you win the Australian Open; go home to New Zealand and win the New Zealand Open, and now you're back up here.   Are you tired at all?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I'm tired.   A little bit jet‑lagged because of the long flight.   But I've been trying to pace myself, go nine holes and do the least amount of practise.   I think just this week, the heat is definitely going to get to me, so I'm just going to try and cool down. 

Q.   How do you cope with that, because it is really, really stinging out there.   How do you control the heat yourself? 
LYDIA KO:   When we are spoiled with such great weather last week, so to come to such heat, it's tough.   But with my cool towel, go under the umbrella and try to have icy cold water every hole.

Q.   You put yourself in birdie range so often, and you give yourself every opportunity.   That's the real strength of your game. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I tried to give myself as many opportunities.   Like even today, I felt good with the putter.   It was close if it didn't go in.   That's always a position I want to be in.
