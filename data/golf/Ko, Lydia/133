Q. Your thoughts on the week?
LYDIA KO: It just shows that I didn't really play well in Korea the couple weeks before, but it just shows that I can have the confidence and even though after an okay first day, I could still put myself back in the mix.  I think there's still a lot of positive the out there.  It was good to see those birdies and those putts.
Q. The Race to the CME Globe gets even more exciting because you pick up points.  Is it exciting for you?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, it's exciting.  Ariya has been playing great and she's consistently putting herself in good positions and that's what I've been trying to do.  I think we both have two events left.  I think we're going to go to the very end.  But whatever happens, I think it's a year and a season that I'm proud of.
I'm going to hope for a good finish the next two weeks.
Q. And you part ways with your local caddie today.  How was the experience and was he happy?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, it was a lot of fun working with Guna (Sargunan).  I think a lot of people came out to not only watch me play but see him in action, too.  It was really good, and obviously all the best to him when he goes back to his player.
