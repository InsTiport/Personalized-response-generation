 Q.  Thoughts on the day?  
LYDIA KO: I ended up birdieing two of the first five holes or something, and then I started missing a few putts.  But you know, it wasn't like it was a bad stroke.  It was close and it just didn't end up going.   
After that, I wasn't hitting it as close, and then I made a good birdie on the first par 5 on the back.  Then obviously it's nice to end the round with a birdie on 18.   
 Q.  3-under on the first day, but the leader is 6-under.  
LYDIA KO: I mean, some holes were gettable and some it was tricky, but I think 6-under by Michelle is really an impressive round.  Hopefully I'll be able to keep consistently playing well and give myself opportunities for birdies.   
 Q.  I heard yesterday they announced some rule changes to be made by the R&A and the USGA.  Wonder if we could get your thoughts, especially on players lining up, they are not going to --  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I guess the player lining up thing, that means I've got two years to get myself to line up straight.  The rest, you know, some of the rules I got to see and I think made sense.  Like being able to tuck down I think spike marks in the future, and I thought the rule that they changed earlier this year about the balls unintentionally moving, that not being a penalty anymore, I think it's going the right direction.   
They are obviously doing the best they can so that it will be more fair between all the players and to try and maintain the pace of play, too.  I think it just means -- they gave me enough time to I guess practice my alignment, so I can't really be complaining.
