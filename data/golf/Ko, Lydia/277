 Q.   Are you a little disappointed that you couldn't finish better this week to make the donation a little higher?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   You know, I wish a couple more putts could have dropped.   That was really the key things that really weren't going this week.   
But no, like I said after the first day, I didn't know if I was even going to be able to make the cut or even make a donation from this event.   But luckily I was able to play all four days, but yeah, you know, the last three days was a lot of grinding, but I'm happy that I can contribute.   
   
 Q.   Do you hope that this spurs more people to donate?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   I really hope so.   I mean it's a very unfortunate thing that happened, and obviously the earthquake Nepal was heard all around the world.   But I hope that with what I did in my press with me donating, I wish other people will be able to contribute also and just be more aware of the things that are going on there.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised all the attention this has generated of you wanting to donate?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   You know, obviously at the end of the day the important thing for me was that I was able to do this donation.   Whether it was publicly said or not, it doesn't matter on my end, but then also it's more on me that people get to know about this and then some people might actually donate also.   
So yeah, I think the media has been great, and you know, it was just, I guess, yeah, to give more attention to Nepal.  
   
 Q.   And will it go to the International Red Cross?   I believe that's what I heard.   
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   I think so.   
   
 Q.   Okay.   Perfect.   Thank you so much, Lydia.   Appreciate it.
