 Q.  Third round of 68.  How difficult was it to play two rounds today?  
LYDIA KO: I knew at the start of the day it was going to be a tough one, I think not only physically, but mentally.   
It's not easy playing out there, playing 30 holes to start with, but to play in this heat.  As the whether was coming in it was getting more humid, which is normal, but we finished and finished well with all of us birdieing the last.   
It was a long day, but I was able to make a little bit of birdies and help the scorecard.   
 Q.  I know you have some goals to start the season, including putting and short game.  How is that coming together?  
LYDIA KO: My putting was I guess a little better the third round than second and first round.  I feel like I'm stroking it fine, but with the new putter I am trying to get a little distance control dialed in and with the new wedges trying to see how much it spins and if it doesn't.   
The wedges are great and they spin a little bit more than my old ones.  I think it's just a little bit of time to get used to.  I think all the changes have been great.  My driver is going a little longer and my irons are going a little higher.   
It's been exciting, and I'm definitely excited to be part of the PXG troops.   
 Q.  I know it's been a long day.  Go and get some rest.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, a lot of sleep, a lot of food, and a lot of water.
