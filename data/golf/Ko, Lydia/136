Q. Just your thoughts on the round?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I made a really clumsy double on the second.  I hit a great drive and then I just leaked a shot in the water.  The rest of the day I was just trying to fight back and put myself in position under par.
And I got back into good position and I hit it in the water again.  So that wasn't good.  But obviously to finish up the round with a birdie on 18 was good.  To bring it back to even, I think it could have been much worse.
