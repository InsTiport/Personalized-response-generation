  KRAIG KANN:   Good afternoon everybody, and welcome to the CME Group Tour Championship.   It's a great pleasure to bring in ‑ I'm just going to go with it right now ‑ the Louise Suggs Rookie of the Year, Lydia Ko to the media center. 
How does that sound to you?   Has to sounds pretty good.
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, any award beside your name, that's always going to sound good.   A huge honor for me to receive the Rolex Rookie of the Year Award tomorrow.
KRAIG KANN:   Let's start with a year ago when we were sitting here talking about your debut coming on the LPGA.   What has this year been like for you? 
LYDIA KO:   It's been a roller coaster ride.   I've had so much fun out here.   I kind of got a little bit of a feel of what it's like playing on the tour by playing around 10 events last year.   That really gave me a good feel and good experience.
I think I was really lucky to come in with that situation and know what it is out here and the players and stuff. 
So this year has been fun.   I got to win two great events, and that was a really cool experience for me, you know, going in situations that I hadn't been in before.
Every tournament has been fun in its different ways.   Just to see other countries in Asia and to play all around in the States, it's been lots of fun.
KRAIG KANN:   You're third in the Race to CME Globe, right?   So you have a lot to play for this week.   Third in the Rolex Rankings.   Has that provided pressure to you coming down the stretch thinking about those things, or are you fairly relaxed about it all? 
LYDIA KO:   I haven't really thought about all that in detail, about the rankings and everything.   It's important, but not what I'm really thinking about when I'm out there on the course.
It's a little bit of pressure.   You know, more the points system, especially with this week being the finale and it all counts here.
I think the CME Globe points has been great for our tour this year.   We're all going out there knowing that every point counts. 
It's been fun for me, and it's like what the guys have for their FedExCup.   It's been an exciting thing, and I'm sure this week is going to be a very interesting week.
You just never know what's going to happen.
KRAIG KANN:   So you're spending all your time off the course playing Candy Crush?   Is that the deal?
LYDIA KO:   No, no Candy Crush.
MODERATOR:   Come on.   I heard you're an absolute legend at this game.
LYDIA KO:   No.   You should ask Bo, the LPGA official, what level he is on.   I've been doing Bubble Witch Saga.   It's the same sort of game.   When I'm in the physio room I'm doing that.
I think I'm getting a little addicted, and I have to blame Jessica Korda for doing that. 
KRAIG KANN:   Questions. 

Q.   All year we've asked you about perspective and how you gained it.   For the rest of your life you're always going to be the 2014 Rookie of the Year.   Has that sunk in yet, and what kind of thoughts do you have about it?
LYDIA KO:   It hasn't really sunk in.   When it was fully announced and they told me that I was the Rookie of the Year this year, it was an amazing feeling, especially with all the rookies here being so talented.   We're going out there and having fun, and we're like really like rookies still.
I think being a rookie, that's a whole new experience, too.   You're only rookies for your first year.   I can't believe that's gone so fast.   To be the Rookie 
  of the Year, it's an amazing thing. 
It's a huge honor for me. 

Q.   You mentioned it's been a year and it's gone by fast.   What's made it go by fast? 
LYDIA KO:   I think just playing week by week.   As an amateur I kind of played one week, took three weeks off. 
Here I'm playing three weeks and having a week off and going back for another three.
In one way it feels long, but as you keep playing and playing it kind of goes fast.   I couldn't believe that this is the last tournament of the year.
At the same time, I'm kind of relieved so I can have some break after all this. 

Q.   You've made just over $1.5 million this year.   If things go your way this week you could come away with $1.5 million; is that hard to understand, or do you count well? 
LYDIA KO:   No, I didn't know that it was $1.5 million.   After Toledo they said I was the youngest millionaire and all that.   Like I said then, doesn't really go directly to my account.
KRAIG KANN:   Whose account does it go to? 
LYDIA KO:   Joint account, and everyone is in reach with my family and everything.   They have done so much for me. 

Q.
LYDIA KO:   At the moment the money doesn't really matter.   I'm having fun out here and learning lots about the tour, and that's been really great.
It's kind of like a job but a fun job for me right now. 

Q.   But you wouldn't turn money down. 
LYDIA KO:   No, no.   (Laughter.)   Extra zeros are better. 

Q.   Lydia, it says here in this players' guide that if you were not a golfer you would like to work in media or broadcasting.   Speaking as a member of media broadcasting, I think I would rather be you.   You're playing with the two ladies, Stacy and Inbee Park, the first two days.   When you're playing with the top players, are you watching a little bit what they're doing, or are you totally focused on your own game?
LYDIA KO:   Last week in Mexico I played with Stacy and Inbee the first day.   I'm always looking at the other players and trying to get a little bit of tips that they're not obviously vocally saying, but just being able to watch their games I always learn something.
I think it's a good experience for me.   They're such great players to play with and always fun to talk to and everything.   So I'm excited about the next two days. 

Q.   You just said that all your money went into a joint account and you didn't have access to it.   Are you on an allowance?   How does that work?
LYDIA KO:   I think the better I play the more I can buy things and my mom says yes and everything.
I don't like to spend a lot, but when I do spend, it seems to be quite a bit and it's more than I thought.
Yeah, you know, I'm not the whole shopping kind of girl.   I try and buy the necessary things.

Q.   You do have your own credit card. 
LYDIA KO:   Yes.   That's been good.
KRAIG KANN:   So what's a lot for a Lydia Ko shopping spree day?   Is it $200?   Is it $2000? 
LYDIA KO:   No, it's three digits.   If it gets to four digits, no.   (Laughter.)   I got myself a home stereo for my room.   I kind of like to create my little space and then kind of design it.
Like clothes and everything I just stick to the couple pair of jeans I have and the shirts, and sometimes I share with my mom even.   One day she could be wearing the same thing as me.
It's more like electronics kind of things that I like.   Yeah. 

Q.   I don't think you've been back home to New Zealand in a long time.   Did you get homesick at any point this year?   You're still kind of young to be so far from home. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I was kind of homesick, but then to have my parents over here, I think that kind of made it a little better.   If I was traveling by myself I think I would definitely be homesick in a month or so.
I was trying to go back just before Evian to New Zealand, but we couldn't find the time so it didn't work out in the end.   I was kind of bummed then.   I organized seeing my friends and everything.   Hopefully I can go back soon. 
Yeah, the biggest thing I miss is actually my sister, not being able to see her every day; just seeing my best friend.

Q.   What are your off‑season plans?   What are you looking forward to?
LYDIA KO:   I'm planning on going home and then maybe going to Korea to see my relatives.   I don't want to see my clubs unless it's really necessary.
Definitely for a month those pink shafts can go in the wardrobe.

Q.   Let's get back to the money.   What would you buy on Monday if you cash big on Sunday?
LYDIA KO:   Well, you know, we got the Nordstrom, is it, the vouchers?   All the players got some.   My mom picked out a bag yesterday, and everything she picked out was over $2,000, and it was getting more expensive as it went on.
We ended up not buying it, but maybe if I win I'll get her something she likes.   She's done a lot for me, so I think she deserved it a long time ago.   Hopefully I can get it for her. 

Q.   Do you drive? 
LYDIA KO:   Do I drive?   No, no. 

Q.   Bummer. 
LYDIA KO:   Oh, no.   I would really recommend you guys not drive near me even if I get my license.

Q.   Do you have your license?
LYDIA KO:   No, no, and you guys should be lucky that I don't.

Q.   You have a timeline for that?
LYDIA KO:   Well, I was trying to learn in the off‑season, but when I'm in Korea I don't think it's going to be that possible with all the snow.   I'm already a dangerous driver; don't want to drive in a dangerous situation. 
Hopefully I'm learn some day.   I'd drive the faster cars, so one day I might drive up in something crazy.   Never know.

Q.   On your first full year on tour, what was the coolest tournament that you had never been to before, and why? 
LYDIA KO:   The coolest event was actually last week in Mexico.   Even in the pro‑am there was lots of entertainment; a little bit of gambling down there.
There were some fun things that go around.   Especially I hadn't met Lorena before, so it was one of my big priorities last week to meet her and get a photo and everything.   What she's done for women's golf and golf in Mexico is pretty incredible.
So I think I had lots of fun there.   I'm not a huge guacamole fan, but I had to try some over there in Mexico because I heard a lot of good things.   But no margaritas yet.

Q.   What surprised you about Lorena?
LYDIA KO:   I heard she was such a nice, humble person.   She retired when she was still world No. 1 because she wanted a family, something outside of golf.
If I was in that situation that would be pretty hard to do, especially when you're earning so much money and getting all the spotlight. 
For her to do that, I think that's amazing.   She held a clinic earlier last week, and to see all the juniors screaming, Lorena, Lorena, Lorena, that was awesome.   Hopefully I can kind of be like that for the kids or juniors in New Zealand and Korea.
KRAIG KANN:   If every shopping spree is four digits for you, you better keep going. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I think make so, especially if my mom picks out $2500 ChloÃ© bags all the time.

Q.   Can you still be a kid, or does this force you to be a grown up maybe faster than you want to be?
LYDIA KO:   Off the course I do a lot of teenage things:   lie on my bed, watch TV, and keep watching TV until my mom screams at me saying, Stop watching. 
You know the things that happen.   You guys have all gone through it. 
But, yeah, you know, it's obviously hard to be that normal teenager when I'm out on the course, especially playing with players that are older than me.
But I think this is really good, because it makes me become more mature.   I think maturity is a very good thing you really need to go through, and the earlier the better, I think.
Even in pro‑am parties or gala dinners you get to meet business people.   Even though I'm not at school full time, I'm kind of learning about the things that go on outside of golf in the world.
KRAIG KANN:   Quick golf question:   21 career Top 10s before the age 18; 14 Top 10s for you this year; 2 wins this year.   That's not the only number of wins you have, but this may be a crazy question, which one are you most proud of this year? 
LYDIA KO:   Oh.
KRAIG KANN:   I wondered if that would be easy for you. 
LYDIA KO:   That's a really hard thing, because Top 10s means you're very consistent.   I don't know exactly how many tournaments I played this year, but I've had more Top 10s‑‑ more than half Top 10s compared to the tournaments I've played.
I think that shows consistency.   I was watching Golf Channel this morning and I saw the number and I was like, Oh, that's pretty good for my rookie year.   For any year I think it's a really good number.
Just the two wins, to pull it off it's tough. 
I don't think I would be able to choose.   Top 10 is great in any tournament. 

Q.   Just curious who taught you the most this year?   Who was your biggest mentor?
LYDIA KO:   I think playing with different players, even if it's not like literally talking about something or they give me advice, I can kind of get a feel and just learn stuff when I play alongside them.
When I play alongside Stacy, has given me some really good tips.   I said, Oh, I am not touching my clubs for a month this off season.   She said, That's good.   You're being smart.
So she's been one of the girls that really gave my‑‑ that helps out here.   I mean, I think just everyone being so welcoming, that's been a help itself.
I've always been welcomed and they've been so friendly, and I think that's been a huge help this year also. 
KRAIG KANN:   Any other questions?   Two more. 

Q.   First of all, thanks for watching Golf Channel.   Number two, what are you looking forward to as far as the tournament this week the most?   Obviously you're in contention for the Race to the CME; it's a huge tournament.   What's most exciting to you?
LYDIA KO:   I think just the points system itself.   I see all the numbers and I'm like, oh, I'm 3 and I've got blah, blah, blah points. 
I think how everything is going to work out, and you just never know who is going to win at the end of the day.   If someone out of the top nine wins ‑‑ or if someone out of the four to nine wins, how all the calculations are going to balance out.   I think it's going to be fun just to see all the calculations.
Being the first year, I think it's exciting.   Yeah, it's just exciting for the whole women's game and of this being the first time, you know, that's it's been played. 

Q.   Are you good at math?
LYDIA KO:   Yes.   On‑course stuff, yeah.   You wouldn't be able to throw some algebraic equations, no. 

Q.   How would you describe your relationship with Inbee and Stacy?   You're playing with them tomorrow.   All three of you have a chance to control your destiny here. 
LYDIA KO:   The more I play alongside them and talk to them on the putting green or on the range the more I get comfortable with them.   They're two amazing golfers, but at the same time amazing people. 
So like I said before, I really enjoy playing alongside them, you know, learning a few things along the way. 
Yeah, think it's going to be exciting.   We played together last week, so it'll be kind of like going on that same rhythm. 
KRAIG KANN:   You've had a wonderful year.   Have a great week this week.   Thanks for everything. 
LYDIA KO:   Thank you very much.
