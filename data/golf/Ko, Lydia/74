 Q.  4-under par round, five birdies, just one bogey.  How do you assess your opening round here at the women's British?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I played really solid.  I felt like I gave myself a lot of good opportunities, especially where there's a lot of bunkers around and I had to avoid them, too, but over all I played really solid, and I felt like I could have had a few more putts to drop.  But starting with the 4-under for the first round of the British, I'll take it.  I think it's a solid start to this week.   
 Q.  You teed it up in the Scottish last week, but of course just for two days.  How do you feel you bounced back from that missed cut at Gullane?  
LYDIA KO: I felt like I played all right, but I just couldn't hole a putt.  And I was actually laughing about it, I only made two birdies there last year and I missed the cut and I was like, haha, that's so funny and I played so bad, and I did the exact same this year.  So maybe I shouldn't really laugh about that.  But I really enjoyed playing Gullane.  It was a pretty fun golf course and it was a good lead up to this one.  Not much golf on the weekend, but I think it was good to get a bit of rest before this week.   
 Q.  And you returned to the winner's circle this year.  Of course, that win at the Mediheal^ , settled with your team now.  How prepared do you feel to try and go low this weekend?  
LYDIA KO: I think I just gotta focus on my game and be confident and commit to every single shot that I'm going to hit and make sure to not pull the trigger if I've got doubts in my head, and I think that's a really big key for me is that I know there's a lot of good things going on, and I just gotta believe in my game and believe in myself and go out there and have fun.   
 Q.  Well, looks like you were today.  Well done.  
LYDIA KO: Thank you.   
 Q.  Lydia, all smiles on the 18th.  How pleased are you with the way that you played today?  
LYDIA KO: I feel like I played really solid.  I tried to give myself a lot of opportunities, which is really the big goal going into today, and we had some really nice weather this afternoon.  So you kind of have to take advantage of it when you've got pretty decent weather.  So yeah, no, I enjoyed playing with my two other players in the group.  I think we had a lot of fun, and it's a long week, so you just really gotta be patient and enjoy every moment out there.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Fantastic conditions, particularly compared to this morning when I'm sure you woke up and looked at your window.  How tough a test is it still out there, even with these conditions?  
LYDIA KO: I think this golf course is a tough course even without the wind.  Obviously there's a lot of sand out there.  You're trying to avoid that as much as you can, and yeah, no, when I woke up, it was gray skies and rain.  So I was looking at the forecast, you know, checking if it was going to be raining all day.  But luckily we got some really nice weather this afternoon, and I think that's why there is a bunch of low scores out there.  But it's a tough course, so you don't want to get too ahead of yourself and just going to take one shot at a time.   
 Q.  In terms of your game at the moment, you've been back in the winner's circle this season which must have felt great.  Where do you feel your confidence levels are and your game is coming in here?  
LYDIA KO: I think it's kind of been an up-and-down season.  Just to be back in that winner's circle in April was a really cool feeling, and I think it kind of gave me the belief that, hey, my game is there and I really can do it.  And if you aren't in that position often, you kind of start losing the belief.  But I felt like things were going good, so it's good to be able to pull it off then.  I've got so many great memories in San Francisco, so I think I was just enjoying being there in San Francisco, and just to be able to play some good golf and be the one holding the trophy was extra fun.   
 Q.  And it must give you great confidence like you say having that belief back coming into majors again and really believing that you are a big contender here this week.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, no, like I said, it's a long week, so you don't really want to get too ahead of yourself.  This is a pretty talented field.  It's not like I'm playing by myself out there.  So I've just gotta be focused on my game and not worry about what anybody else is doing and if I'm able to produce and get results, that's great.  I think confidence is a huge key for me, but I just go out there and hit my shots without worrying about anything else.
