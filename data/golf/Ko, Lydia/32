  Q. Can you talk about your round today?
 LYDIA KO:   I holed a lot of good par putts.  I just made the bogey on 18.  When you've got like on 80-footer for birdie, to say that you're going to make two putts from that length every single time, it's more of the shot that got there than the putter's fault.
 But two pretty solid rounds.  I haven't made the cut here at The Scottish Open a couple years.  It's nice to be playing on the weekend and the weather turned out really nice.  So I'm looking forward to some good golf.  It's not easy out there, even though it's not super breezy.  Hopefully I just keep steady and see how it goes.
 Q. You were saying you were tired?
 LYDIA KO:   Last night we got done at 9.00 and I got to the hotel at 9.40 and was eating dinner close to 10.00 and by the time I showered it was 11.00 and I decided to wake up at 4.00 to leave the hotel at 4:45, so I was pretty tired.  I prefer my nine-hours sleep over the five.
 Q. Started again at 8.00?
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, but it took us -- we were probably the second furthest hole away from the clubhouse.
 Q. Did you have that walk out, for health and safety?
 LYDIA KO:   Yes.
