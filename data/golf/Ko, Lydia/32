Q. First round, 69. Good way to start any round.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I did well with the birdie on my 2nd hole, and then made a really good par putt on my 3rd hole. Kind of made a careless chip on the next hole, so I kind of missed a birdie opportunity.
But I was able to putt really well, and it's like a round at that could have been better, but I think it could have been worse, because if I hadn't holed a few good par putts even on my back nine and the front, I would never have been able to shoot a 69.
Overall I felt like it was pretty sold. If I could get a few of those loose irons, more greens in regulation from there, I think it would make life a touch easier.
But, no, it's a solid start to it event.
Q. How much does a closing birdie help?
LYDIA KO: It was good because I know at one point I got to 4-under, and then I wasn't hitting my irons as well down the stretch very well. You know, I had like a 15-footer for birdie on the last, and it wasn't an easy putt. I kind of wanted to finish strong, especially where I had been at one point in the round.
No, it's always nice. I think hopefully gives good momentum going into tomorrow, too.
Q. And you've had success here. Closed with a 66 last year, so this course seems to agree with you.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I played well here last year. It was kind of an up-and-down week overall, but always to finish off with a 66, to finish first or second or 40th, it's always nice to finish with a low number.
I feel like this is a course where if you can be smart, you can shoot some lower ones. Greens are getting firmer, so positioning is actually an important thing coming into these greens.
