Q. By your standards a difficult round.  What was not working?  What was the struggle?
LYDIA KO: I was hitting my drives really well.  My long game was pretty good.  I like had a few miss-clubs, and I couldn't make up and down on like 99% of the shots that I missed the greens.  I was struggling on the putting greens.
The drive was great, but from there it was pretty average.  It was really hard to get anything rolling when you're not putting that good either.
Q. Do you go to the range and work on your irons?  What do you do after a day like today?
LYDIA KO: I didn't hit it that -- I think my long game was pretty good.  It was just few miss-shots on the wrong holes.  I think I need to work on the putting.
No matter if you're hitting it good or not, if you can putt and you can make up and down when you're missing the greens, that makes a huge difference.
So I think I'll definitely be seen on the putting green quite a bit this afternoon.
