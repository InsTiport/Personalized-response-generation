 Q.  Moving day is traditionally a Saturday, but you made such a great move yesterday, what was it like today to make a positive move up the leaderboard today?  
LYDIA KO: I think the biggest key around today -- well, the biggest difference was the wind.  I know it was breezy from the mornings.  I knew that it would play a lot tougher than yesterday, because the majority of my round yesterday was played in calm weather.  So people, they say it's moving day on Saturday, but it was really tough out there, because the course is drying out, firming up.  And it was tough to get near the pins on some holes.   
 Q.  How reassuring, though, is it for you to be so comfortable on the greens?  You holed a couple of clutch putts up there, and you seem very, very confident in your stroke.  Is that a good feeling that you've got going?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I was rolling the putts really well yesterday and I think that kind of made my round turn around and in position for the championship, too.  I've just got to trust my stroke, trust my read, and just put a good stroke on it because at the end of the day the wind might affect it, I might have the read a little off.  All I have to do is trust my game, and that's all I can do, and just enjoy it out there.   
 Q.  Well, you looked like you're very much enjoying it.  But you're also very calm out there.  Paul Azinger in our box commented that probably your heartbeat only raised when you dropped that club and nearly hit the ball on 17.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I was going -- my heart stopped for that moment.  You don't want something like that to make it and just cost you a penalty, because that's a stupid mistake.  But hopefully that doesn't happen again so my heart doesn't get a heart attack.  I've just got to stay calm.
