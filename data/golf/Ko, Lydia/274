  THE MODERATOR:   Happy to be joined in the media center by defending champion, current leader, Lydia Ko. 
Lydia, what about this course do you like so much? 
LYDIA KO:   I mean, I don't know.   This is a very tough golf course.   You need to position yourself well, and even if you're on the fairway sometimes it's really hard to hold it on the green.
It's really tough in pretty much all aspects.   I hit the ball pretty good where I wasn't in too much trouble.   If I did miss it a little bit I kind of got away with it, too. 
Holed some good putts and ended up with a 67 today.   It's a really good start, but I know I've got three more long days to go.   Hopefully I can continue hitting solid shots.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   We keep hearing from everyone this is an extremely tough golf course, but the leaderboard has a lot of red numbers.   What is it that makes it tough, and how are you able to play so well?   A lot of people strung a number birdies together. 
LYDIA KO:   I think it really depends on the pin positions, too, day by day.   Today I think the first couple holes they were playing downwind, so that made it a lot easier.
So like the first hole, you know, I hit an 8‑iron, I was hitting an 8‑iron, whereas yesterday in the Pro‑Am I was hitting a 5‑iron or hybrid into the greens.
So it's definitely‑‑ I think a lot depends on the wind.   Sometimes the holes are really hard to hold.   If it's into the wind I think makes it a little easier. 
It really depends on the conditions of the day.   I think the scores are really good for how tough it was.

Q.   I believe you said on Tuesday you wanted an early tee time tomorrow so you would have some more time to celebrate your birthday.   Does having the fact if you play well tomorrow you can sleep in a little bit longer give you more motivation?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, especially me having a solid round today, it's good that it won't be long until I come out here again.   Thank you LPGA or the computer system who did the pairing. 
Yeah, no, it kind of went as planned.   Hopefully I will have a good one tomorrow, but you just never know.

Q.   Any special plans for your birthday tomorrow night?
LYDIA KO:   Just going out to dinner, a group of us, so should be good.

Q.   Did you think you had an eagle there?   Looked like it was in on your little short chip.   Just kind of hit the pin.   Did you think that was in? 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, a little bit, but I knew it was coming in quite hot.   I kind of said, Hit the pin, you know, in my mind.
It's tough here because greens are so firm.   Even though you have a short chip, you kind of have to bump it or hit a high one to kind of be soft.
So it would've been great to have an eagle, but still coming off with a birdie, it was good. 

Q.   You're in this position quite a lot, but you only turn 18 once.   Are you planning to approach your birthday round any differently than any another?
LYDIA KO:   No.   I'm just going to go with the game plan I have.   Tomorrow morning, because we're playing in the morning, it's definitely going to fly a little less and the course is going to play a little longer.
In that aspect it's different, but I won't change it just because I'm one year older.   Really I'm only one day older tomorrow. 

Q.   You're one stroke ahead of Juli Inkster, who is three times your age.   What do you know about Julie and what does she mean to the LPGA Tour?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, you know, couple days ago during the Pro‑Am dinner we did a Q & A together.   Juli is a legend, were Hall of Famer.   It's so cool that she still plays well at her age.   That's why I think golf is a great sport.   It doesn't matter if you're 10 or 20 or if you're 60, everybody can play.
She's definitely showing that.   What she's done for the tour is pretty amazing.   Yeah, you know, I think the tour, we're getting more popular because of players like her that kind of showcased the LPGA throughout the years. 
THE MODERATOR:   Good playing.   We appreciate the time. 
LYDIA KO:   Thank you.
