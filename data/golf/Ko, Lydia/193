 Q.  How important is it to be three from the lead here?  
LYDIA KO: I'm not really thinking about it.  I'm trying to think about that shot I have in front of me.  There's still so many things to focus on and think about here than think what could happen at the end of Sunday.  There's still a lot of golf to be played.  A lot of the girls are playing good golf.  It's not like I'm the only one in the field.  I've just got to enjoy it.  We know it is tough.  So we've got to stay patient.   
 Q.  When people say you're so young, and how are you doing this, and so much so soon, what's your reply when you hear that?  
LYDIA KO: I'm not the only one here.  There's Lexi who is a couple of years older, and Ariya and Min Lee and Brooke, we're all still I guess -- I guess Brooke and I are still in our teens.  And you can see that by the winners this year.  Before Anna, I think all the winners were under 23.  That's why I say age is just a number.  Obviously if we played out here a long time that means you have a lot of experience, which can really help you through those critical moments.   
But that's why when we're out there, we're not thinking about who's 30 or who's 19, we're just all players trying to play our best.   
 Q.  There's a theory that it's easier when you're young.  You don't maybe know all the things that can happen.  Do you buy that?  
LYDIA KO: That could be true, but you can just look at it both ways.  They say because you're young, you're fearless, but I still get nervous out there.  So that theory kind of doesn't work with me.  But the thing is when we're out there, we're not judging anyone by their age or think, hey, she's playing good, because she's 29.  We just think, hey, she's playing really good, and she's been playing consistently well.   
The age question -- there's new girls coming on Tour playing really well at a young age.  And I've been thankful that I've had role models like Michelle Wie and Paula or Lexi, that have come on Tour at a young age and kind of blocked the spotlight.
