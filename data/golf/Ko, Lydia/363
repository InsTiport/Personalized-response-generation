Q.   You started out beautifully. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, birdie on the first hole, that's always good, but then I don't play as good when I have a birdie on the first hole.   But then I'll take it anyway.   Yeah, I think it was a pretty solid start.   My putts didn't fall, but I felt like I rolled it really well.   I'm happy even though‑‑ yeah. 

Q.   We were commenting that this was probably the worst score you could shoot given how many really good putts you had for birdies. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, especially the front nine, which was my back nine, a few slipped by, and I said, oh, man, not again.   Yeah, like I said, I felt like I rolled it really well, and that's really all I can do. 

Q.   Guy told me that this is live on TV in New Zealand, and I guess that's never happened before. 
LYDIA KO:   I think it does.   They do it a couple times but not that many times because it's far away, timing and all that.   But yeah, it's good that they can see it live.   Yeah, because we don't exactly have like Golf Channel.   We have lots of golf shows like HSBC, like sports and stuff.   But not like Golf Channel like here. 

Q.   Before there would be just highlight packages where you would get to see the best shots from the tournament?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I think so, and then they sometimes put it on news and stuff.

Q.   Had you ever seen this tournament, a broadcast of it, live growing up?
LYDIA KO:   No, no, I've never seen it.   Yeah, I've never seen it, and it was the first time when I came here that I saw the course.

Q.   What was it like being paired with Michelle today?
LYDIA KO:   It was fun.   She's my idol, so I was very excited.   But I was less nervous today because I played with her at the (indiscernible). 

Q.   Do you like your position today? 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I mean, I know I could have played better, but I mean, I could have been worse at times, as well.   Yeah, it's a good step. 

Q.   Michelle has her little Stanford water bottle.   Were you thinking, oh, I'll just like‑‑
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I saw her water bottle, and she's got the head cover, as well.   So yeah. 

Q.   It seemed like you two didn't chat too much when you were out there.   You were going in different directions, though. 
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, we chatted a couple of times but not every single hole, yeah.

Q.   Would you like to?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I like to talk, so...
