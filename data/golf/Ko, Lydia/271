 Q.  So first, what a day today.  Enormous crowds for day one of the championship?  LYDIA KO: Just by seeing the practice rounds the last couple of days, I knew there would be a lot of people out here when the tournament started.  It was pretty packed.  It was all spread out, so it was great to see the crowd.   Q.  What were your thoughts on the way the course was set up today?  LYDIA KO: I think they balanced it out well.  There were some longer holes that they pulled the tee up so it would be a little bit more approachable.  It's definitely tough out there, but the course balances it out.  So it was pretty good.   Q.  We heard a lot about how important it is to hit the fairways, hit the greens.  What do you think are the keys to success?  LYDIA KO: Hitting the fairways is really important.  A couple of my bogeys are from me hitting it left in the rough.  When it's thick, it's hard to get out of there and hard to judge it.  Hitting it in the fairway and on the right side of the greens are really important this week.   Q.  Finally, heading into tomorrow, your personal keys to success, what are you hoping to do?  LYDIA KO: I had a pretty solid round.  Obviously a little disappointing to finish with a bogey.  I think I'm hitting the ball well and my putting feels good.  So hopefully I can continue this and just have fun out here.  The U.S. Open is a once-a-year thing, so I want to have fun and enjoy it
