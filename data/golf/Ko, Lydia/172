 Q.  A little bit of a struggle I know for you today.  How would you assess what happened?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, you know, nothing was really that great.  My short game wasn't that great to cover up for the missed shots and when I did hit it close, the putts didn't go in.  When that's the case, you're not going to shoot a low score.  But hopefully a few more putts drop tomorrow.  I've just got to stay positive.  There's still a lot of golf to be played, and just hit one shot at a time.  It's not an easy course but by the looks of it, it's playing easy for a couple of the girls.  But it's because they are playing great.   
Hopefully I'll able to have a low one tomorrow and put myself back in it.   
 Q.  Going into tomorrow, would you change anything?  And do you feel like there's a really low number out there for you tomorrow?  
LYDIA KO: I hope so, but everything depends on the weather and the pin positions.  If they tuck pin positions or put it on difficult slopes, then obviously it is harder to approach with the long game and the short putts, too.  But I think I've just got to stick to my game plans.  I don't feel like I hit a wrong club or something off the tee, or just game-plan-wise and course management, I've just got to stick to it.  Hopefully it's important to hit a lot of fairways, as it is getting drier, and hole a lot of putts, and I think that's the key.   
 Q.  Playing with the hometown favourite, you're the world No. 1, that's a pretty big pairing.  What was that like out there?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, it was really cool on the first tee as we just walked out for the crowds to cheer us on.  It's always cool to play with the hometown favourite and a hometown girl like Charley.  And she played great golf.  So I think the fans had a great time.   
It was just great, the numbers, for it being a Thursday, and then we're right in the middle of the day, I think it was pretty impressive.  I think crowd-wise, it's only going to get bigger and bigger as the days goes on.
