Q. Final round 65, so close to an eagle there on 18.  You said it just lipped-out?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I hit a really long drive, and Pete was like, "Hey, it's 179 to the front."
And I was like, "Whaaat?"   Like, "Maybe you should double-check it because I shouldn't have 179."  But I had a great drive and hit a great second shot and hit a great putt that lipped-out.
But no, I'll still take a birdie on the finishing hole.  When I was on 17 tee, I said I want to finish with two birdies, and I was able to do that.  I played really solid today.
I had a few par, I guess 12-footers for par on my front nine that I was able to hole and make a bunch of birdies.  I'll take my 65.
Q. Anyone will take a 65, great for a good runner-up finish four.  Tell me about this week:  Starting in the rain, now to the bright sun, a lot of fans out.  It's really turned into a good week here at Miramar.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I think we were all worried about the weather at one stage, and even coming off yesterday to 54 holes, we were like, "Oh, thank God."  We knew that the weather was going to be pretty decent today, and I think it was even better than the forecast.
It's great.  It's great that 72 holes are done and a lot of fans are able to come out today.  It looks like there's a lot of kids, which is always great for the game.
