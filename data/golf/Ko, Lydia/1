  Q. Yesterday we interviewed Lydia Ko after her round; she was eight back in a tie for sixth and she said to me, why are you talking to me?  It's because of rounds like this today.  Lydia, when did you know that this was a special round?
 LYDIA KO:   I don't think it was like there was an exact moment where I felt like, okay, this is going to be a good one.  Especially around a course like this, you just have to focus until that last putt drops in the last hole.
 Early in the week I was talking with Sean and he said make sure that I'm out there hitting with 100% conviction.  I said, Commitment?  And he said, Conviction.
 I think that that's what I've tried to focus on, my feels.  I got off to a really good start.  Being 3-under after two is never a bad way to start your round.  I think I got a couple lucky breaks.
 Overall, my game was really solid and I felt like I gave myself a good run at it, but maybe Patty was just a bit too far away.
 Q. With the challenges and different changes that you've made over the last few years, what will you take away from your amazing finish here?
 LYDIA KO:   I think it just shows it doesn't matter how far back you are, you can always go for it.  As long as you have one hole in front of you, there is always a chance to make birdie or eagle.
 I think you just have to be really patient.  I felt like my game is trending in the right direction.  The first couple days this week and last week was a little messy, making clumsy mistakes here and there, but I feel like I was able to bring that together, and I've really just tried to have fun out there and I think that is such a big key for me.
 When you're enjoying it I think everything kind of follows.  Today is happy Easter so I feel like God was watching me and gave me all the right bounces, right breaks as well.
