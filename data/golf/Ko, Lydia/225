 Q.  You probably didn't like having to get up this early for just one putt, right?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, for three putts.  But no, what can you do?  I just hit all of my -- apart from the third one, a little too hard.  So I'm going to go get maybe two more hours of sleep and get out here later this afternoon.   
 Q.  What's the plan for the next couple hours?  
LYDIA KO: I don't know.  I'm just going to have a sleep.  Yeah, go sleep like this, sleep for a couple hours and get back out here.  My next tee time is 1:45, so I'll just prepare myself for that, and yeah, should be good.
