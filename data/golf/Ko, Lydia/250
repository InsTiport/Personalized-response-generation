 Q.  Fantastic week for you.  You are the youngest winner of a major championship since 1868.  Can you believe it?  What does it mean to put your name in history like that?  
LYDIA KO: I mean, it's pretty amazing.  I didn't really know how this day would end up.  I just tried to focus on my game, and I didn't really know I would make my putt on 18 out there because it was my goal to par the 18th for the first time this week.  But I failed.   
But no, today was an awesome day.  It's been such an unbelievable experience, and everybody won't ask me when I will win my first major because it's done.   
 Q.  Are you relieved to be through that and you don't have to answer questions about it anymore?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, you know, I'm glad you won't be asking questions.  Yeah, the first time, I think it's different and the most memorable, and it's hard to get to that first.  Yeah, it's been so amazing.  I'm at a loss for words.   
 Q.  Let's talk about the round.  You were three behind to Lexi towards the start of the round.  When did things change for you?  
LYDIA KO: You know, I just kind of played pretty consistent.  You know, I turned in 3-under and made a good two-putt on 10, and then I made two good birdies in a row, and I think that's where I started to get in a good rhythm.  Unfortunately Lexi made double on the par-3, 14th, and it's a tough hole, so I think that's where it gave me a little bit more breathing room.   
 Q.  You shoot 63 today; where does that rank among the rounds that you've played in your career?  
LYDIA KO: It's probably the best round ever.  To finish with two birdies, finish on the last 72nd hole, with a birdie, it doesn't happen often, so it's definitely one of the top rounds of my whole entire life, and I'm sure it will be in my career.
