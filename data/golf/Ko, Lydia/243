Q. All right.  We're here with Lydia.  Overall you should be pretty pleased with your opening round here at the Evian?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I know I maybe left a couple shots out there, but then I made some birdies where I didn't expect it, so, yeah, I guess everything just balanced out.  But overall I think it's a pretty solid start to the week.  Hopefully I'll be able to play consistently like this for the next couple of days.
Q. How would you describe the course conditions out there particularly on the front nine?
LYDIA KO: I think because of the dry some -- there are some drier patches especially on the greens, so it's not as even as we wish it could be, but it is what it is.  Especially if it's weather related, you really can't do much about it.  I heard that the greenskeepers have been trying to put a lot of water on the course so that the grass would grow, so everyone's trying their best.  Obviously sometimes we can get unlucky in putts, but like I said, it is what it is.
Q. Your featured group today, you bested the other two.  How good does that feel?
LYDIA KO: I think everybody was just concentrating on our own game.  I guess, talking a little bit along the way, but, yeah, everyone's just focused on the game.  I think hopefully we'll all have better scores tomorrow.
Q. While you were out there, did you notice what Lexi was doing?
LYDIA KO: I saw her score.  I kind of realized it was going pretty low especially at the start of the round and she was only a couple groups in front of us.  I was on the par-3, 14th or something, and that was only her fifth hole of the day.  And I saw her to my left and showed her scorecard.  I saw some birdies, some eagles and some bogeys, so that's a pretty consistent scorecard there.  I think it's a great start to the tournament for her.
