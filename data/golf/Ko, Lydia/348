 Q.   All right.   Here with Lydia Ko driving in a cart right now, racing on the airport.   Lydia, can you talk about what was working for you today, what wasn't?  
LYDIA KO:   I had a really good start.   Making four birdies on the first five holes was really good, and I struggled in the holes after that, but you know, I tried to get myself together, and I made some bogeys in the wrong time, which wasn't ideal, but I tried my best until the last.  
   
 Q.   Now, going back to those bogeys, what happened on a few of those?  
LYDIA KO:   You know, for a couple of those, my shot making, you know, I hit my putts slightly‑‑ well, not slightly.   I hit it way too hard, so I kind of ran past the hole, four, six feet, those kind of putts are not the most ideal lengths to have for your par.   
   
 Q.   Now, at what point were you aware of Karrie finishing and what you had to do to actually come out on top?  
LYDIA KO:   I didn't really know until the last couple of holes.   I knew when she was 8‑under, but I didn't know that she finished 9, and it was a really good 9, and I knew I needed to make some birdies to catch up with her.  
   
 Q.   And talk a little bit, did you feel the pressure going on to the 18th?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   I pulled my drive and I left my second shot a little short, slightly too short for a nice little tap‑in birdie.   
But that happened, but I gave it a good round with my putt.  
   
 Q.   Great tournament overall.   You feel good heading into Kia next week?  
LYDIA KO:   Yeah.   I think I played really well overall, so I'm just going to take the positive out of it.  
   
 Q.   Perfect.   Thank you, Lydia.
