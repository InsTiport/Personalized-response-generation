 Q.  How do you summarize the week?  You were so close at the end?  
LYDIA KO: It's a little disappointing but to me I'm more disappointed that I made two bogeys on the par 5 today rather than the part that I bogeyed the last hole.  The 18th, it was long and they pushed the tee back to normal and I hit driver, 5-wood from there.   
I played my heart out and I tried my best and that's all I can do.  I think playing and having a good finish last week gave me good momentum coming into this week.   
 Q.  The last hole, the lovely bunker shot and then just curled around?  
LYDIA KO: I was in the rough just short of the bunker and my putt was to the left.   
 Q.  But all signs are very good for the future?  
LYDIA KO: I think last week, having my best finish in a few months and best finish of the year I think gave me confidence this week, and I felt like the support was immense.  I don't know if it's because I'm one of the past champions or not but it's great.  Having Evian as my sponsor, it's really cool being their ambassador.  Like you could see Frank, he was walking around watching me play.   
It's a really cool event and this tournament means a lot to me.  I wish I would have been in that playoff, but I can't do anything about it now.
