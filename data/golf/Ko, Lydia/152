 Q.  A little bit of scrambling today.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah.   
 Q.  You said you were looking like more of an exciting player.  Usually you're a boring one.  Keeping things exciting.  
LYDIA KO: You know, actually the front nine I hit my driver really, really well.  I don't think I missed a fairway.   
And then I hit No. 10 and kind of hooked it and then knew it wasn't going right.  On 18 I knew that it's one of the tighter fairways to hit, so that's why I decided to hit 3-wood off the tee.   
Ended up working fine.  It was my first par in the past five rounds I've played here.   
 Q.  Interesting.  What was particularly tricky about today?  
LYDIA KO: It was tricky for me because on the back nine I really wasn't hitting fairways.  I was making up and downs.  It was a good thing my wedge shots or chip shots were good enough where I was able to get off with par.   
So, yeah, you know, I guess it's a good thing if one thing is not going right something is going to support you.  Hopefully I'll be able to hit some more fairways tomorrow.   
I was hitting it fine, I was hitting it great on the front nine, so it was quite weird in the back.   
 Q.  What did you make of Annie Park's round?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, it was good.  I think 7-under, and then In Gee is 8-under.  Very impressive.   
I mean, it seems like ever year there is a really low one, and I always wonder, Man where was that from?  I shot 8-under and I said, Where did that come from?  It's not an easy golf course, especially with the rough being juicy.   
If you're hitting the ball great and leaving yourself good opportunities, because the greens aren't super fast, I think if you're stroking well and everything kind of is going your way, that's I think what happened for the girls.   
But it's nothing to say that -- I mean, it's very impressive rounds.  Annie start on the back nine and it said she was like 7-under through 8, but I thought she meant like -- just like literally she played eight holes.   
I was like, Man, is this a 59?  That's why it's just so weird when you look at leaderboards and you're not looking very carefully and you see what's going on.
