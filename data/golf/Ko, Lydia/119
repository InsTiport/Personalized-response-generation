 Q.  Long day; how do you feel?  
LYDIA KO: I mean, I was scrambling quite a bit, but I was driving it good.  Birdie opportunities, there were so many that were so close yet didn't fall.  It's kind of been the story of the last few days.  But hopefully a few more will drop tomorrow.  Even though it was these kind of conditions I still was able to finish under par, so got to be happy with under par.   
 Q.  How big was it to bounce right back from the bogey start with a birdie?  
LYDIA KO: Well, I mean, it wasn't an easy pin position.  I drove it in the rough, and it was obviously hard going towards there.  But then No. 2 was downwind, so I actually hit a really good drive and a very mediocre second shot and a really good third shot.  We all ended up birdieing it, so it was definitely nice to have it come down like that.   
 Q.  You've been in this position before, a few strokes back and been able to bust out with a very big final round.  You might have to do that the way Lexi is playing right now.  Can you see that possibility out on the course?  
LYDIA KO: I think I'm quite a few shots behind, but all I can do tomorrow is try my best, and just depending on the wind direction and how strong the wind is, it plays a huge factor here.  Hopefully I'd better make my share of birdies and just be focused on my game.
