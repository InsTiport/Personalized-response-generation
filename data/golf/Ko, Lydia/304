Q.   Your front nine, very explosive start?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, I had a little bit of a shaky start.   Wasn't hitting it too well the first two holes but then I kind of got things rolling.   I was close to hitting the pin on the par3, third and just gave myself a lot of opportunities.   I think two or three of them were just within like two feet.   And that's good having those kind of short birdie putts, but I think I played well overall today. 

Q.   You're only 17 years old but you've played a wealth of golf.   Were you nervous stringing that many consecutive birdies together?
LYDIA KO:   I kind of did this at the Australian Open last year, so I kind of knew what kind of a roll I could possibly get into.   But after leaving my putt like an inch short on 9, and that could have been my seventh in a row but I think I played well overall, and you never know what's going to happen down the last couple holes.   You've just got to concentrate down the last.   And then I hit kind of loose ones down the end but I think 7‑under is a good score. 

Q.   Scoring is hot today, Inbee once again is leading the charge.   You're going to have to really step into gear come the weekend?
LYDIA KO:   Yeah, Mirim Lee, she shot 10‑under today and Inbee seems like she's going to shoot one of those, too.   It's not been too windy the last couple days.   I think that's what is making it a little easier.   But there's still two more days to go, and you never know until that last putt comes down on that Sunday.

Q.   Playing 18 with Yani, when she snapped herself iron; that the first time you have seen that?
LYDIA KO:   I haven't seen something fly out that far in a tournament.   I was really surprised.   I was trying to see where the ball was going but all I could see was something bigger.   That wasn't too good but she finished well making that up‑and‑down.   If I was in her position, I would be like, oh, my God, what's happening.   But she kind of got herself together and made a good par there. 

Q.   You won on this course before.   What particularly about this course suits your eye and what do you like about it? 
LYDIA KO:   It's a course where you can shoot some low scores, but no, I haven't actually seen the course where there's been like‑‑ where there's hardly any wind.   So it's kind of different.   I kind of feel like, man, am I playing the same course. 
But it was great to play in these conditions and also get the windy times.   It's a great course setup, so always excited to come into this week.

Q.   And finally, your good friend, Danielle Kang, another hole‑in‑one, another car.   Did you hear about that and what are your thoughts about that?
LYDIA KO:   She's just crazy.   I think I made three birdies out of the four par 3s today and I thought I was doing well.   But two hole‑in‑ones in two weeks, I would take that.   Obviously she's striking the ball very well to be aiming straight for the pin, so good on her.   Maybe she might get one next week at the Mizuno Classic, you never know.

Q.   Two cars, what's that like?   Are you guys going to give her flak for that?
LYDIA KO:   No, she's got two really nice cars back in L.A., too, back at home.   So I think she's got four great cars now, yeah.   I would love to have one (laughing).
