Q.   So you finished 2‑under today going into the weekend.   Can you kind of take me through the difference of yesterday and today weather‑wise, course conditions?
LYDIA KO:   I think the first couple holes the wind was actually less, so made it a little easier for us.
It's really tough.   I made birdie on one and then made a bogey, so kind of until the 9th hole fell with the same score.   Then made bogey on 9 and had, I guess, a shot better on the back nine. 
So it kind of balanced out.   Yeah, I mean, I made two kind of clumsy short game mistakes, but it was okay.

Q.   Pretty big battle out there through the whole field.   What do you think the score for the tournament is actually going to be?
LYDIA KO:   Not really sure.   There has been some 5‑overs and also some 5‑, 6‑unders.   I think it just depends how close you're going to hit them and then just give yourself many opportunities.
But with the wind, it's really tough.

Q.   Plan going into Saturday? 
LYDIA KO:   Hopefully hit the ball well and just give myself as many opportunities, even if I make the same amount of birdies. 
And reducing the bogeys I think will be the key for the weekend.
