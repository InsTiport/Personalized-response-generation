  Q. Lydia, how do you feel after your first round here at Golden Ocala and round one under your belt?
 LYDIA KO:   Yeah, today was bit of a struggle.  I hit the ball really well and I was having a hard time judging the wind.  Because it was quite subtle it was fluctuating quite a bit.
 I three-putted on my 11th hole and that kind of took the lid off my head a little bit.  And then I was able to get a string of birdies, which kind of put me back into good momentum.
 Yeah, nice to finish with a birdie, but overall I thought it was a solid round.
 Q. Two straight solid weeks.  Your game must be in a really great place.  How confident do you feel in your game right now?
 LYDIA KO:   I think I'm just trying to focus on the small things, the things I can control, and just do a good job of being committed and hitting each shot with confidence.
 If I hit a good shot, great.  If not, can't really do much about it.  I think having the internal goal helps to put less pressure on the result stuff and just, yeah, do a good job of what I can do.
