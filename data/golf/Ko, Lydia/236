 Q.  Very positive way to finish, 2-under today, low round of the day so far.  Has to be a step in the right direction from the first couple rounds?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I mean, I shot better the last 67 holes compared to the first five.  The first five holes, I was 5-over par.  So that kind of rounded it up, the first day.  It got better as the days went on.  I did miss a couple putts here and there.  I think that was the most disappointing thing.   
This grass isn't that easy to read.  So obviously it's very hard.  And with the wind and everything, it's just not easy out there, and you can see by the leader's scores.  I'm happy that everything's over and I can relax and go back home.   
 Q.  Looking forward to some rest?  Do you think this week was a little tiredness, too, just because it was such a hard test?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I've never come to an event on a Wednesday and played on the Pro-Am that day and get right into it.  It's always, you only have three days on the Sunday, but this week it was even less.   
I'm happy that I finished strong the last couple days, but that's why I tried not to practice too much afterwards so I wouldn't be to tired for the days coming up.   
 Q.  What do you think the first couple days issues were?  Was it the conditions or anything with your game specifically?  
LYDIA KO: I couldn't get any putting distance control going.  It was much slower than last week, and my brain just couldn't connect to it.  So I just hit it like normal, and one of the putts went halfway.  So that's not good.  So that's why I think I really struggled with the green speed.  If you don't have the right green speed, it's hard to read putts, too.  Putting I think is the most important thing, and if that's not up to your A Game, it's very hard to contend.
