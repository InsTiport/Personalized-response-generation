Q. A great round, Lydia.  Is that you?  We're struggling to recognize you.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I guess different hair, different color.  People that haven't seen me in a while, a little bit of losing weight since last year.
Yeah, I guess a different me.  When I first changed my hair color I didn't recognize myself in the mirror.  My mom kind of joked saying I looked a bit bald because of such light hair color.
I'm getting used to it and getting compliments.  I'm going to try and maintain this for as long as I can.
Q. Great round today.  It was tough out there.  How difficult is to win on the LPGA Tour?  You won this year; five times in 2015.  There are so many good players.
LYDIA KO: I think every season it's getting much tougher to win.  Just the amount of talent on our tour is incredible.  My mom was spectating last week and somebody told her, Hey, these girls are playing so much better.
I think that just shows how well each player is playing.  And for players that have had multiple wins, how great they've been having within this season.
So does make it tougher, but I think it's also great for the game of golf.  Internationally it brings a lot people in, a lot of kids to be inspired by watching us play.
I think it's great.  It inspires us and drives us to play better and work harder.
Q. You had a good run of results coming into this event.  Playing nicely.  The question we have for you, can you turn around and tell us how many tees can you fit in your hair?  Just the nine tees?  Safe place to keep them?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, sometimes I go in the shower and then I untie my hair and starts dropping in the shower and I've got to pick them up.  Tees go with me everywhere.  They're in my backpack, golf bag, pocket from the last time I wore the pants.
So, yeah, a little aggressive on the tees, but I feel like there is not enough and then I put more in and I end up with nine.  (Laughter.)
