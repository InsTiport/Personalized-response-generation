 Q.  What do you remember of your win here?  
LYDIA KO: Probably not the best thing to remember, but on the final day, on the 10th hole, I double hit my putt, which is not good.  I made the next for six or whatever it was, double.   
Yeah, it was kind of in a little pitch mark just short of the green.  From behind the ball didn't look like a really big pitch mark and I never really checked from in front.   
I hit it and it went so high up that it hit I think my shaft.  Yeah, so technically I double hit it one on the head and one on the shaft.  Luckily I was able to keep it together and still make a few birdies coming in.   
I remember I birdied the last hole, which is always nice to always cap it off in style.   
 Q.  Of that win, do you remember what kind of emotions you felt after?  
LYDIA KO: Well, I love Carlsbad, and I feel like all the fans have been amazing, whether I played good or not.  Just to win in front of them I think was an adrenaline boost.  I think I did one of those little fist pump things whenever I made the putt on the last.   
It's pretty cool when you come to one of your favorite spots and always feel like you're well received here and you get to win in front of the crowds.  It was just a lot of cool things and probably will be one of my favorite memories whenever I come back here.   
 Q.  You are a fan favorite everywhere you go.  Not just where you've won.  Like you said, is that more welcoming, more pressure?  
LYDIA KO: I think it's always more welcoming, and the more I guess the years pass being on tour, at first you do I think definitely get a little nervous playing in front of bigger crowds than what you're used to.   
I think when you don't have crowds you miss them.  At the end I think you end up embracing it.  Without the crowds, if it wasn't for them, wouldn't be as much interest in the tour and for the players, too.   
So I think they're part of who we are, and I think obviously we love seeing big crowds.  We wish every week we had big crowds like this.  I think this is one of probably the best crowds we have domestically.  Always love seeing them.  I think we just get a good vibe.  Kind of want to play even better golf for them.  They come out here and want to see some good golf and we want to showcase the talent of the LPGA to them.   
 Q.  What are your goals this week?  
LYDIA KO: Hopefully No. 1 thing is just to have fun and enjoy it.  I think top 10 in any event would be a job well done.  Obviously it's the week leading towards our first major of the year, so hopefully a lot of positives to gain from this week leading into next week.   
Yeah, you know, just enjoy being out here, enjoy beautiful Carlsbad is and the amazing weather hopefully we'll get this week.   
 Q.  Week before a major.  Where is your head at?  What are you focusing on?  How are you using this week to gear up?  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, obviously two different style golf courses.  This is a good golf course to I think lead up to the next week.  Yeah, no, I guess we play three on the west coast but they're all different styles.   
I think like even from last week to this week it's a bit different.  Last week you're kind of going out for the birdies, trying to make as many putts as you can.  This one there are I think a few more tougher holes.  Having par is not really you may finish having pars, and that is just not really the end of the world.  Pars are going to be good on quite a few holes.   
I think different course management, but this is probably like a little bit more similar to next week.  You know, I like that there are varieties and you're hitting a lot of light irons and wedge shots last week, and here it's a bit of longer clubs and bit of a mix for next week.   
Yeah, it's just a good leadup.  I try and play the week before a major.  I think you just get to know what you need to work on, and obviously I was able to get a solid finish last week.  Hopefully another one before next week.
