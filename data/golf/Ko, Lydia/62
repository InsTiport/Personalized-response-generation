 Q.  As you were standing out there looking at this big scoreboard, what did you think?  
LYDIA KO: I was just looking, not really paying that much attention to it.  But obviously the girls are playing great.  I'm trying to make my share of birdies, too.   
 Q.  Think if you play well tomorrow make some things happen?  Never know?  
LYDIA KO: I feel like the greens are so nice.  It's rolling so good that if you have some sort of decent read on it and you put a good stroke, you got pretty good chances of making a fair amount of them.   
I'm just going to play my own game out there.  I'm quite a few shots behind.  You just never know what's going to happen.  I'm just going to focus on my game.   
 Q.  And be prepared in case?  
LYDIA KO: Yes, yeah, and enjoy the last Sunday of the official LPGA Tour.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Thoughts on your round today?  No bogeys.  
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I played pretty consistent.  I feel like I left a couple out there, but I holed a few really solid birdies.   
Yeah, no, all you can do is try your best.  The course is great and you see a lot of the girls are making a lot of birdies, so you're trying to play aggressive but at the same time make sure to not make those silly mistakes.   
So I've been trying to do that and just enjoy it.  The weather was amazing today, so nice to not play in too humid or too cold weather.  Perfect conditions.  I tried to take advantage of that.
