Q. Speak a little bit about that finish at 18.  Quite a good break off of the tee not to find the fairway bunker at 18.  Did find the greenside bunker, but an impressive up-and-down.  Talk a little bit about those last two shots.
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I found the smallest area of the fairway for my driver, definitely got lucky on that one, and I think got that lie.  I tried to converse the ball a little bit more and I ended up pulling the shot, and I went in the bunker.  And the last thing I was expecting was for it to be plugged, because you know, it wasn't flying into that bunker, but yeah, I think the sand was soft, so it plugged, but also because it was soft I could get behind the ball enough and make it up and down.  And I actually didn't think I would be able to stop it short of the hole and I could get it out of that lip.  But yeah, that up-and-down, I think, really saved me.  And I think it's a nicer way of having lunch now after this.
Q. I'm sure it is after getting that one in to save par.  Talk a little bit about the patience that you need to have when playing this golf course, and how impressed with how well you've done that so far.
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  I think with any major championship you need to be super patient, more patient than any other tournament.  But you know, here, it's a tough golf course.  I said that the first few holes going out, and you know, the holes coming in are really tough.  So you just kind of have to focus the whole way around.  And sometimes making those pars, 2-putting for pars is really not the end of the world.  So yeah, no, you just gotta be super patient, and when you're being patient and you're confident, you can give yourself more opportunities.  I think I've been trying to do that, and hopefully I'll be more patient over this weekend.
Q. Good going so far.  Enjoy that lunch.
LYDIA KO: Yes.  It's going to be good.
