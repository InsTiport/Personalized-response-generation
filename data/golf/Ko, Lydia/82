Q. So you were oh, so close, there on 18.  Tell me your thoughts coming off the course.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, obviously was super close.  But I'm happy with the way that I fought back.  But rather than the bogey on the last, my two sixes on the scorecard, I think that was the killer.  And it's not like I made it on a par 4; I made it on the par 5, which are kind of the holes that you expect to make birdies or come off with pars and I made two bogeys today.  I think that was kind of the killer.
It was probably the shot of the year for me, the chip-in on 15.  It kind of reminded me of what Ingee did last year.  It was really cool to play here, and I feel like the support was immense.
So it was a pretty cool week.  I'm obviously disappointed but I think I'm proud that I was able to give myself a run for it, even though after awhile I was a few shots back.
Q. Talk about the shot on 15.
LYDIA KO: It wasn't the easiest chip.  That pin, you don't really know where is the easiest place unless you're on the putting green.  I just said, hey, I literally need to hit it like six feet and then it will do its work.  It's a bit of luck that it goes in, but I executed it pretty well.
So it was just the right spot and the right shot at the right time.
Q. So now you're going home?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I'm going home.  It's been since before Australia that I went home.  So it's going to be nice to go back and see my friends, and my next event obviously is going to be the New Zealand Open which is nice.  And to have the girls out on Tour come to our backyard, it's going to be a cool week.  Kind of like what happened for Brooke at the Canadian Open.
I'm super excited and excited to have a few days off, see my friends.  It's a long trip home but it's going to be something that's worthwhile.
