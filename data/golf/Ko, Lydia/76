Q. You got off to a cracking start in the first round today.  Top of the leaderboard after round one.  Talk us through the last two days.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I played well last week in Taiwan.  I pretty much putted everything in that I possibly could, and the last two days has been kind of the exact opposite.  I've been struggling with the putter the last couple days.  That's why I wasn't able to score as well.  But hopefully the putts will drop tomorrow.
Q. How do you deal with the heat?  Is it something you just take in stride?
LYDIA KO: It's super hot but for now we've had no storm delay, so I think that's one thing that's helped.  Just try and go under the umbrella or a cool towel and drink a lot of water.
Q. Currently you're tied in 15th place, so another Top-10 finish potentially for you.  What's the plan for tomorrow?
LYDIA KO: Hopefully more birdies than the last couple days, and just give myself a lot of good opportunities.  Hopefully a lot of people are going to come out and watch us play on Sunday.
Q. What do you think about Pink Saturday and what will you do now?
LYDIA KO: I think I'm going to do some practice afterwards.  Because it is so hot, I'm not going to spend too much time outside.  It's great having great music and great food; I think it engages a lot of people.  It's great not only for the players but for the fans.
Q. KL, a place you enjoy coming to?
LYDIA KO: This is a great event.  Sime Darby and IMG and everybody involved does a great job in hosting the event.  They always make it fun for the players and the spectators, just everybody that comes along.  So this is a cool part of this event and hopefully it will continue for a long time.
