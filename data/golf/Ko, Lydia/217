Q. How did the first day back go?
LYDIA KO: The first few holes was -- first nine holes was pretty rusty, but it almost felt like a whole group, as we made the turn we started making birdies.  10 was my first birdie of the season.  So yeah, it was great.  But obviously starting to get back into playing competitively and trying to think more target orientated is definitely different to hitting balls on the range.  Yeah, it's a pretty solid start.  I'm happy with the way I finished today, and definitely the back nine and hitting a few wedges close, gave myself better looks for birdies.
Q. At 12, how close was that?
LYDIA KO: It was like maybe just over a foot, ended up.  It was like maybe a 72-yard shot, and I used my 59-degree and almost hit a full one.  But I felt like I was hitting it a couple yards further today, maybe because it was a little warmer, and the last few weeks in Orlando has been pretty cool, so maybe that's why with the adrenaline the ball is going a little further.
I definitely felt like even like No. 9, it normally should carry 159, but it carried like 167 or something, so I was really surprised.  But that's, I think, part of the first tournament where you get your feels and you get used to the distance control.
Q. Did you have any nerves?
LYDIA KO: I was definitely nervous.  You could see by my shot on the first hole.  But no, I think we had a great group.  I was really looking forward to playing with Paula and Morgan, and when you're with people that you're really excited to play alongside, the nerves kind of seems to be at the back of our mind.  But no, there were nerves.  If I said I didn't have any, that would be a lie, but I think with just how we were laughing and talking, I think it just kind of went through.
Q. You mentioned to Jerry that it's a long season and balancing things out.  I heard you talking about what you expect from yourself and not to expect too much all the time?
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I think that's what I've been learning is sometimes you almost push too hard, and that way you don't perform as good.  That's where I kind of experienced during May-June last year where I almost was pushing myself so hard that it wasn't that much fun.  Even today on the front nine I was shooting 1-over, but I was like, hey, I'm pretty sure there will be birdies coming.  If I approach it that way it gives me more of a positive thought, and Sean Hogan, my coach, said yesterday, think positive, present.  Just be positive.  And then we were joking like negative past.
But no, if I'm more positive, then even if I have one more hole, maybe I can give myself one more look for birdie.
Q. What was your reaction out here, the crowd and everything?
LYDIA KO: I think it was good.  We got pretty good claps the first hole, and I'm pretty sure the numbers will just get larger as the week goes on.
Q. And the course compared to last year?
LYDIA KO: You know, it's pretty similar.  Not much has changed, but obviously it's because it's been a little cooler the last few weeks, maybe a little bit more wet, but other than that, not much is different, and you know, even the course management style hasn't changed much.
