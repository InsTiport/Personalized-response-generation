Q. Kind of an adventurous last three or four holes.  6-under, will you kind of take that after that --
LYDIA KO: Yeah, I don't know if I hit it a little hard or if it's a little unlucky.  I hope it's a little unlucky, on 15.  But then I holed a good one on 16 and made a good up-and-down on 17 and par on the 18th hole is never a bad score.  So yeah, you know, it was interesting.  I gave myself a couple extra birdies, but on the back nine I had a lot of long putts, so I was actually making a lot of three-footers for par, and at the end of the day, I made all of the par putts, which was important.  No, but I guess all the par putts I holed, they maybe balanced out with the 15th birdie.  But I played really solid, and I holed some really good longer ones, two longer ones on my front nine, which was nice.
Q. It's an unusual week.  Have you wrapped your head around the fact that there's only one more round left?
LYDIA KO: Well, I mean, last week was a 54-hole event, and then my first time playing this championship was when Suzann won; that was a 54-hole event.  No, I'm totally okay with it.  The only thing is I have to pack my bags now.  But you just have to go with the flow.  There's one more round, and there's a lot of great names up there, and it's a pretty packed leaderboard, so I think it's going to be a pretty interesting Sunday.
Q. I know there's still a long way to go, but you've been through a lot.  You've been patient, waiting for something.  How much would winning a major this year change the entire year for you and your outlook?
LYDIA KO: I think it would just give myself confidence that I'm still playing good.  I played good last week, and I think that really helped just mentally inside.  Not saying to anybody else but to me that, hey, you're playing good stuff, and you just have to be patient and be positive.  Even when I was struggling, I felt like there were so many positives.  It was frustrating to know and kind of understand that I don't know what's going on, but it's golf.  You know, a few putts that drop and a few putts lip out, there are a few shots here and there.  I think you have to be so patient, and it's going to sometimes go your way and sometimes not.  I just try to stay as positive as I can, and my family and team has really helped me with that and said, hey, let's do this, come on, just be patient and what are we going to work on to improve for the next week, and I think that's really important, no matter if you're playing great or average.  You always have to come back to the basics and say, hey, here are the things that we need to work on and how are we going to do -- what are we going to do to make that better.
Q. I know that you've worked with a mental coach in the past.  I'm sort of blanking on the name right now.
LYDIA KO: Yeah, Dr. Lehr (ph).
Q. Are you still working with --
LYDIA KO: Not really, no, but I think obviously it's really nice to have people and someone that's going to mentally help you, but I think even though there isn't one specific person that's like a mental performance coach, I've had my coaches and a player even last week said -- Stacy said something really nice to me.
I think even though I don't have one strict person, I've really kind of really felt the support, and I think it's great, and they've really said, hey, don't worry about it, don't worry about what happened two years ago or last year.  Just think about the player, me, now, and I think that's really important.
Q. Is that what Stacy said?
LYDIA KO: Yeah.  She said don't get caring about what happened last year or what's the difference.  I'm different now to what I was a year ago, and I think she really put it into great perspective for me.  She said like a few really nice things throughout these years I've been on Tour, and it's so cool.  Obviously we're competing against each other, but she's been super supportive and really nice, so I really -- it was really cool, yeah.
