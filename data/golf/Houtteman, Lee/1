 Q.   How does it feel to be a Michigan pro and play in a Major in your own state?  
LEE HOUTTEMAN:   It was exciting.   It was a lot of fun.   It was more than I expected.   I just enjoyed it.   
And the guys I played with were great.   Actually I like the golf course.   I love it.   I thought the greens were, it made you think.   And guys, you just got to hit it in there.   You can't miss it a foot here or a foot there.  
   
 Q.   Wind today a little bit less severe?  
LEE HOUTTEMAN:   Yeah, it was a little more forgiving.   Yesterday we played in the afternoon and it was, I wasn't ready for that.   But today was better.   I shot 72 or 73 today.   73.  
   
 Q.   Actually quite a bit better than yesterday.   
LEE HOUTTEMAN:   Yeah.   Hit it about the same, but yesterday I putted one a foot and it rolled in the rough and I made a bogey here or there.  
   
 Q.   The scores seem to be coming in lower today.   
LEE HOUTTEMAN:   Oh, yeah.
