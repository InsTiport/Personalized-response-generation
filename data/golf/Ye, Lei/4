 Q.  It was an exciting match, seesaw all the way.  The last putt, just kind of describe what's going through your -- pretty challenging putt, downhill slider.  
LEI YE: I knew I had to make that putt to continue the match.  Honestly, I felt like I had a pretty good chance at it.  I had been putting decent all week, and I think I gave a pretty good run at it, and it lipped out, so I guess it wasn't meant to be.   
 Q.  Describe the match today.  It was very tight all the way.  Nobody really had a big lead until the second nine.  
YACHUN CHANG: It's a final match.   
LEI YE: Yeah, a lot of pressure.  Just tried to do our best out there, but -- I don't know, it was hard to not think about anything.   
 Q.  Was this the first time you guys were in a final match play type of match in a competition?  
LEI YE: Yeah, first time for USGA for me, but I've been in other ones.   
 Q.  What do you guys think you learned about your games this week?  
YACHUN CHANG: Be patient.  Just hard-working.   
LEI YE: Yeah, definitely there's some parts that we could maybe fix up a little bit and be better under pressure.   
 Q.  You guys were 2-up, I believe, after 14, and then I think they won a hole with a par, correct?  What happened on 15?  
LEI YE: We both just had a little wayward drives, came out a lot faster out of a bunker than we thought, and the returning putt just didn't quite make it.   
 Q.  How about your overall thoughts on the week, not even how you guys played?  
YACHUN CHANG: It was good.   
LEI YE: I think we cooperated pretty good as partners.   
YACHUN CHANG: We really did our best.   
LEI YE: Yeah, for the most part.   
YACHUN CHANG: And that's enough.   
 Q.  Do you think you'll be back next year?  Obviously you've got exemptions for three years to play in this, and it's in Florida?  
YACHUN CHANG: Maybe.   
 Q.  Depends on, I guess, college for you?  
LEI YE: Depends on college for her.   
 Q.  It'll probably be between the conference and the regionals again like this year?  
LEI YE: Yeah, hopefully it'll work out for her, so if that's the case, we'll definitely come back.   
 Q.  You're probably excited for college?  
YACHUN CHANG: Maybe.   
 Q.  What's your summer schedules like?  Are you going to try to play in the Women's Open?  
LEI YE: I'm just going to play a bunch of tournaments out here, mix of junior and amateur ones.   
 Q.  Are you trying for the Women's Open, both of you?  
YACHUN CHANG: Yes, on May 14th.   
LEI YE: In Florida.   
 Q.  Both of you, same spot?  
LEI YE: Yes.  We are going to be teammates over there.   
 Q.  And then obviously the Girls' Junior and the Women's Am?  
LEI YE: Yeah.
