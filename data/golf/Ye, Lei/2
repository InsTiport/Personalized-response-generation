Q. First let's talk about the caddie.  How did that come about, and did it help a little bit?
LEI YE: It definitely helped.  I walked in, saw her eating lunch.  I'm just like, hey, would you want to caddie for me, and she was like, yeah.  So that's how it came about.  I worked great with my caddie from this week so far, but just Rose having played the course definitely knows it a little bit better, and she's got like a player's point of view, too, so it was really good just being able to confirm some of the stuff that I was thinking of, yeah.
Q. How comfortable was it having sort of a big lead coming down the stretch with four, five, six holes to play?
LEI YE: Definitely a lot easier than when I was only 1-up or 1-down at one point earlier this week.  You know, I think it's a little bit less pressure knowing that if I play good pars and make a birdie or two, that will be enough, that I'm not coming from behind and forced to make a bunch of birdies to make up for it.
Q. How do you feel just about being in this position in general on the eve of a final?
LEI YE: It's amazing.  You know, it's -- yeah, it's pretty amazing.
Q. How do you feel with your game right now, your confidence level?
LEI YE: I mean, I've been hitting it good all week, so that's -- I'm pretty confident in that.  I have been putting quite well the last two days, so I think most important I'm going to tell Rose her job tomorrow is just to keep me relaxed, chat with me, have fun out there, and she's going to go do her homework tonight.  And if I just keep relaxed, have fun playing golf, I know the shots will go where they need to go.
Q. Are you scheduled to play in the Women's Am next week?
LEI YE: Yes.
Q. What will you do in between?
LEI YE: Well, we're driving down, so that's probably going to take me to about the practice round.
