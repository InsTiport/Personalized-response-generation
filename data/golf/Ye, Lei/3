Q. So you got off to a hot start, birdie, birdie, and took off from there.  Maybe tell me a little bit about your round today and how you're feeling.
LEI YE: I've been hitting my approach shots pretty good this week.  It's kind of like the putting that's not necessarily let me down, but kind of held me back a little bit.
I think during lunch today I managed to kind of loosen up my stroke a little bit, keep it smoother and longer, and I made a lot more putts this afternoon.
Q. Yeah.  So U.S. Girls Junior quarterfinalist.  What does that mean to you?
LEI YE: I mean, this is my last junior event, so I'm definitely hoping for a good finish to it.
Being quarterfinalist is obviously a good step in this direction of having a good finish of the junior golf career.
Q. What is your mindset going into tomorrow and what's it going to take to keep it going?
LEI YE: I mean, it's another round of golf, so just going to try to keep the same relaxed and kind of confident mindset.  I've been hitting it well, so if I stay relaxed, the shots are going to go where they need to go.
