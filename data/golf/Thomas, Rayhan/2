Q. He really came after you right from the start, rolled in that 10-footer for birdie at the first, and it seemed like he was off and running.  How did it look from your angle?
RAYHAN THOMAS: Yeah, he played superb.  I didn't play good enough, and he just played solid.  I think he shot 4-under or 5-under for 14 holes, so you can't do anything about that.
Q. When he went to work with his wedge and the ball fell in at 9 and then he hit it tight at 10, were you thinking, what's up with this guy?
RAYHAN THOMAS: Yeah, no, I know he's the best player in this country, and he's one of the best chippers in the world, so I didn't expect nothing less, and he delivered.  He played superb.  He holed a good chip on 9, holed a bomb on 14.  Just putted and hit the ball really good.
Q. How would you assess your week here?
RAYHAN THOMAS: Superb.  I mean, I loved it.  Whether or not I did well or not, just loved being here, being in this atmosphere, playing in competitive tournaments in the United States, which is the best place for golf at the minute.  So yeah, I loved my week.
Q. How will this help your confidence going forward?
RAYHAN THOMAS: Help me a lot.  It's given me a lot of confidence going forward.  I've got the Western Am next week, so looking forward to it, and just for the year, it gives me a lot of confidence to know that I can play against the best juniors in the world.
Q. Do you expect to be back next year?
RAYHAN THOMAS: Yeah, for sure.  Definitely I'll be back.
