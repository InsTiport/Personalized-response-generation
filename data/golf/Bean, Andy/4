 Q. Your low round in this event. What was going right for you today?
 ANDY BEAN: Well, it was -- you always have to make putts. But I kept the ball in play pretty well, had a couple of stray shots, but the hard holes I seemed to play well for the most part and that certainly doesn't hurt. 

 Q. Was there any one thing that got you going today or was it just a nice steady round?
 ANDY BEAN: Not really, I started out, I actually made a, probably a 10-footer on the first hole for a par on number 10. 
 And after that I made a 6-footer for a birdie on 12. 
 I went on around and made about a 7 or 8-footer on number 17, which when you hit it in there on, it was like 235 today, and I hit it in there about six feet, I could sell that. I could probably sell that for a hundred grand at least. 
 But, no, it was just one of those rounds that I hit a lot of good shots, made a couple bad shots, and I ended up paying for one of them. But I birdied the last two holes, so hey, I'm disappointed with the way I prayed overall, but today was a good round. 

 Q. Now that you got all 72 holes in the rear view mirror, what was your assessment of the course?
 ANDY BEAN: Well it's a difficult course for me to play. I don't know, that's the best way I can put that one.
