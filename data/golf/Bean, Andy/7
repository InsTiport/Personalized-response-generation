   ANDY BEAN: I thought I hit some good shots that turned into some bad shots. I got it up and down quite a bit today. I'm putting really well so I'm pleased with that.  
 This golf course will give up some scores if you play well. Wind doesn't seem to be blowing half as much as it was. It seemed to have died down.  
I enjoy playing golf over here. I enjoy the bump and runs but don't enjoy the bunkers. I'm putting well and I'm looking forward to the weekend.
