 Q. Nice round again today, you're right in the thick of it really with 5-over par. 
 ANDY BEAN: Yeah, I am. Bogey on the last hole hurt a little bit. But all in all I'm going to have to work hard the next two days to have a chance, but it certainly is within reach. 

 Q. What was the difference between yesterday and today other than the weather?
 ANDY BEAN: Oh, I just, it's blowing about 10 or 15 less than yesterday when we played. And it was actually it was cool this morning when we started, the back nine was nice though. And it's starting to warm up a little bit. So you're going to see some better scores. I just hope I have two of them. 

 Q. Now if the weather gets warmer, will that do anything to change the greens?
 ANDY BEAN: Oh, it will certainly firm the greens up a little bit more, which is good for me. But it will also loosen my back up, which is good. So I think it's good for everybody. 
 The firmer greens, you're going to have to hit better iron shots in there. But if you're driving it a little bit further, then it's easier to hit iron shots. 

 Q. So you were pretty good off the tee today?
 ANDY BEAN: Well, not as good as I would like to be. That's one thing we're going to go practice a little bit. 
 But all in all it was a pretty solid round. It could have been a few shots better. But it could have gone either way.
