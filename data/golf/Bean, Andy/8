   ANDY BEAN: Well, I just started out a little tough. It's a tough golf course to get started out on. I was a little behind early after I made bogeys on Nos. 6 and 9 but then I birdied 10, 11 and 14 and then No. 16 coming in. Shooting 31 coming in is a good score anywhere, especially here. I got it up and down on 17 and 18, too.  
 I don't think the golf course played that tough today, but it was playing just tough enough if you didn't have your good game you were going to be penalized. It will play tougher in the coming days. I'm in good position so I certainly can't complain.  
 I enjoy playing over here and love playing in the wind. It's a challenge on every shot and every hole. Maybe it makes me concentrate a little more. I certainly love it.
