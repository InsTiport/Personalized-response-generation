Q. Alison, how are you feeling after that bout of food sickness, it looked like you were handling things pretty well out there?
ALISON LEE: Yeah, I feel great.  To be honest I was a little nervous on how I would perform today.  I didn't feel good to practice at all yesterday or the day before that.
I woke up this morning and I felt brand new and I was hitting some balls and I felt good.  I feel like I hit a lot of shots today.  Everything that happened today was everything I could have imagined.
And being out here in the Solheim Cup, especially playing along with Angela, here, it was really fun.  And we fought hard out there.  But we've got to just brush it off and get ready for tomorrow.
Q. Unfortunately, you ran into a very hot Charley Hull.  Six birdies on her own.  But you came back with a nice eagle at 13, birdie at 14, but maybe a case of too little, too late.
ANGELA STANFORD: Yeah.  She played great.  And she made everything she looked at, it seemed like.  And we did fight.  And we're always going to fight.  We just didn't make some early.
