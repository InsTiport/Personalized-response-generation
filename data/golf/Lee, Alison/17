 Q.  We're here with Alison Lee.  2&1 victory here in your singles match, after quite an emotional morning for you.  How were you able to turn it around and how are your emotions coming off the first tee in the afternoon?  
ALISON LEE: You know, I had a lot of great support from my teammates, definitely.  As soon as I finished my morning match, the entire team was there for comfort and support.  It really got me fired up and ready for the afternoon match.  Yeah, definitely lots of emotions and thoughts running through my head before I teed off.   
But I just tried to remind myself and focus on this afternoon's match, because I really wanted to get the point.  It was a great match
