 Q.  What happened with the nosebleeds, and how are you feeling now?  
ALISON LEE: Oh, I'm fine.  It happens all the time.  It's happened at previous tournaments.  It's just annoying.   
 Q.  Last one was Kingsmill, though, right?  
ALISON LEE: Yeah.  I mean, I get them all the time, but it just was not stopping before the round.  But it's fine.  Yeah, I'm fine now.  No big deal.
