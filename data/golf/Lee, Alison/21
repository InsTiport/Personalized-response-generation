 Q.  You guys ran into a tough duo that seemed to be on fire from last night and then this morning, as well.  How tough is to play people that seem to be making everything?  
ALISON LEE: Yeah, definitely.  They played really well, draining long putts and getting a hot start.   
But we did -- Michelle and I did our best to keep our head in the game and played our own game.  Unfortunately, you know, we missed a few putts and hit a few shots here and there and we gave a few away that we could have made.   
It's match play, that's how it works.  And obviously both of us haven't won a match yet.  We're both very disappointed about that because we really need points on the board at this point.  Yeah, we need to keep our head in the game, stay confident and not let ourselves get down too much and get in a bad mood because it still isn't over and we could turn this around.   
 Q.  It's tough when you run into a buzz saw group that seems to have so much momentum.  What is that like when you're playing in a group that seems to be making every putt from wherever it is?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, it's tough and we played good out there today.  Obviously they made a lot of putts.  They made a lot of birdies.  And alternate shot it's tough.  We played our heart out there today and it's frustrating, for sure.  But Alison did great today and we made a good team and that's really all we can do.   
 Q.  How impressed have you been with her as a rookie in this group, how she's not only fit in, but how she's competed out there when you guys have been out there?  
MICHELLE WIE: Yeah, she definitely plays like a veteran out there.  She holds herself really well out there.  She plays well under pressure and she's a great teammate.
