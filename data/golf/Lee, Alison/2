 Q.  Final round today.  Obviously off to a tremendous start.  Three straight birdies.  What kind of happened after that?  Just the wind picked up?  
ALISON LEE: I mean, yeah, starting off the bat it was really windy and I was really happy with my three birdies because the first three holes played pretty tough.   
But, yeah, I just couldn't get it going.  I gave myself a couple chances throughout the rest of the round.  I just couldn't follow through.   
Missed a few fairways on the back nine, so could have gave myself a good chance at birdie on the approach shots.
