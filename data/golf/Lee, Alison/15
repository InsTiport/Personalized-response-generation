 Q.  I'm here with Alison Lee who is sitting at 8-under for the tournament.  You started the day at 6-under; 2-under for the day.  You had a couple of bogeys on the back nine, 15 and 16, otherwise everything was going so nicely.  Tell us what happened there.  
ALISON LEE: Yeah, I'm definitely a little disappointed with my bogeys obviously, especially with the leader being at 10-under.  I wish I could be right there with 'em.   
Yeah, I pretty much had two bad approach shots.  Didn't finish up with great putts.  (Indiscernible)  Saved two pick ups there, but overall I am really happy with my round today.  I feel like I made a lot of the good saves.   
Kind of went downhill, but really looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're only two shots behind the leader.  It's the kind of course you can come up with a lot of birdies, and you're still in contention, Alison.  
ALISON LEE: Yeah, for sure.  This is definitely a birdie course, like you said.  Obviously you can see with the leader being at 10-under.  Tomorrow I'm going to have to fly at pins and putt aggressively.   
 Q.  You've seen Brooke Henderson and Minjee Lee have victories in their rookie year.  Do they give you inspiration and motivation?  
ALISON LEE: Yeah, definitely.  Brooke and Minjee, I've played and Minjee since I was like 13 and I've played with brook a few times before we turned professional.   
Yeah, we were all great competitors before we came out here, so it's nice to come out here and kind of grow up together.  To see them win, I'm very happy for them, but definitely gives me inspiration to play well.
