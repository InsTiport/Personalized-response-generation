Q. Low third round of the day, or of the days I guess we should say.  Talk about how you're playing right now?
ALISON LEE: I feel like I was hitting it really well today.  I finally was able to get some putts to drop.  I did not get any putts to drop the past two days, which is why I shot even par, so today I finally got some good rolls in and came back out in the morning, hit a few good shots, got two more birdies, so yeah, it's a great round.  Happy.
Q. And then just interesting position to be in so close to the lead and you're first out for the fourth round.  What's your mindset going into the final round?
ALISON LEE: You know, I just don't want to think too much about it.  I'm really happy with my round and how I've climbed the leaderboard, but I'm going to be playing right behind the leading group after I make the turn, so I'll be able to see how they're doing, so that'll be pretty interesting.
