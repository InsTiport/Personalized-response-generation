 Q.  First of all, tremendous accomplishment.  I know you wanted to get just one more, wanted to write a little bit different story.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes, I did.  I like to put it in the book perfect.  It's okay, we fought hard to get here.  We had a lot of fun.  Neither of us expected to get this far and it was a great experience.   
 Q.  You ran up against and both played competitively around the country I'm sure.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes.   
 Q.  So you know these players and what you were up against.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes.   
 Q.  But you also showed that you totally belong in environment.  How does that feel to you?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Feels really good.  I mean, they both played so amazing today.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yeah.  Their putting was on fire and they were just dropping birdies.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: We tried our best keep up.  I mean, we got all the way to 17, so I guess we did pretty well.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I think so.   
 Q.  Not only that, but there were a couple holes that they were just discussing there you had putts that got it from two to one, and that changes everything.  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yes.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes.   
 Q.  Everyone knows.  Just couldn't crack that.  Were the putts just not falling this afternoon?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: For me, I had a good amount of putts drop for me earlier in the morning, and then just I was skimming the rim all day, just so close.  None of them dropped, but that's golf.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I agree with that.  It's golf.   
 Q.  Jillian, you had a couple putts just right by the edge.  I was thinking on the short par-4, 11.  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yes, 11, that putt.  Hole 11, the putt, I knew break and I got over it and I just think something went a little wrong in my stroke there.   
 Q.  And it missed a little bit to the right?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I missed a little to the left of the hole.  I should have walked off with the ball but...   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: That's okay.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I was like, you know what?  Let's just make this.  Just wanted to fire away and give it my best shot, so...   
 Q.  We've all had that situation where we want to step away but we don't and we stay over it and you wish you maybe had backed off it?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: It works both ways though, because then if you back off and you get back in and you miss it, it's like, eh, can go either way.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Was it tough bouncing back from 20 holes this morning?  They started out quick but had a little rest.  Was it difficult to rewind and get back out there?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I definitely think so.  I think the green really changed throughout the day, so that definitely changed how we were reading the putts.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: I agree with that.   
 Q.  Were you in any way tired?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: No.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I don't think we were tired.  I think the adrenaline was going the whole time.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: I completely agree with that.   
 Q.  After they went 3-up pretty early, Megan was making everything she looked at and everything, talk about the way you battled back for the next 12 or 13 holes.  You really did fight hard, didn't you?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Thank you.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Thank you.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: We just tried to like keep our gas on the gas pedal, just tried keep on pushing forward.  They were both playing really well.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yeah.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: We just tried our best to hang on for as long as we could, and got to 17.  So, yeah.   
 Q.  And match play, as you know, is a funny game.  You can not have your best game and you can sneak through, but you can also just be struggling a little bit and just not quite getting there.  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Just barely missing it.   
 Q.  This morning you had the 2-up lead and they came back and tied you.  You've got to be really thrilled with how you responded in that match to win in 20 holes.  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: For sure.  That was definitely a...   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: It was a clutch match.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: It was head-to-head the whole time.  Could have gone either way.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yeah.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I think it just worked out just right for us though.  It was definitely a fair match and both teams were playing solid.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: I agree.   
 Q.  I think I heard a little bit there.  So Jillian, you have another tournament coming tomorrow?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I think I'm leaving in the next day or two.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yeah, you're leaving tomorrow.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Oh, tomorrow?   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: That's what your dad told my mom.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Well, I'll sleep in the car; I'll sleep on the plane.   
 Q.  For what event?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I'm going to the AJGA -- I don't know the name, but it's in Rome Georgia.  I apologize.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Maybe the Rome Junior.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Something like that.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: I think my next tournament is going to be in the beginning of June probably at the AJGA Ez-Go.  We'll see though.   
 Q.  Both going to try to play the Girls Junior?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: For sure, and the women's amateur as well.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yeah, and I'll play a qualifier...   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: I actually have my Women's Open qualifier on Monday.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: She'll have another 36 holes to walk.   
 Q.  Got a little time warm up for that, right?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Exactly.   
 Q.  Thank you both so much for all the help this week.  I enjoy talking with you.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Thank you so much.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Thank you so much.   
 Q.  What year at Ohio State?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I will start in the fall 2020.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: And I'm the fall of 2021 at Auburn.   
 Q.  So are you a junior in high school now?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: I'm a junior.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: And I'm a sophomore.   
 Q.  Okay.  Great.  Because I know sometimes people start mid-year.  Great, thank you both.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Thank you so much.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Thank you so much.
