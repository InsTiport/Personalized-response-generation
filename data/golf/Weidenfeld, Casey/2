 Q.  Took a little bit to get it finished, but you got it done.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes.   
 Q.  Impressive win, right?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes.  Thank you.  We fought our butts off, and I would say they did the same as well.  We were back and forth a lot.  They made a lot of clutch, clutch shots at the end.   
It was a tough little challenge.   
 Q.  You were in the hole and they were making putts to get themselves -- to get the holes halved, or is that close to what happened?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Like 15, literally one of the girls hit her shot to like I swear this far.   
 Q.  Wow.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: We had to make birdie to...   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: ...square the hole.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: We were like, Oh, my gosh.  And then she also made like a 40-putt on 16 to get the match going still, and we're like, wow.   
 Q.  Who is that?  Which one?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: How do you pronounce her name?   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: The girl with the blonde hair.  I don't know her last name.  (Talking over each other.)  No, it was the other girl's name, so...   
I'm sorry.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: We like literally ran up to the tee box earlier.  We didn't even like...   
 Q.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was a whirlwind day.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yes.   
 Q.  How did you feel overall?  It's a marathon, right?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: It's a marathon.   
 Q.  How do you keep yourself focused on the task at hand?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Well, I mean, having a partner by my side is definitely helpful.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes, and she was there for me on the last nine.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yeah, was it the first match play day?  Yeah, we like juggled a lot.  Like I had a few holes where she helped me and she had a few holes where I helped her and it just really worked out.   
 Q.  Last thing:  Do you know anything about tomorrow?  What's your thoughts?  Just keep staying the course with what you're doing?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Pretty much.  Keep on pressing the gas pedal.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Keep fighting.   
 Q.  It's been four days now.  One day, one day, and then two matches today.  It's been a long haul.  How are you feeling about it so far?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: It has been an amazing experience.  It's been awesome.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Have you learned a little bit about yourself?  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Yes, we have.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: We have.   
 Q.  How so?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Well, we had a little trouble on Sunday like just like...   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Our personalities are really opposite.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yeah, clashed a little, and so we made sure, Okay, this person doesn't like this and this person doesn't like that, so let's not do it anymore.   
 Q.  Was it a case of just knowing how the other person plays?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yeah, how they play, prefer to be like...   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: You're more intense.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Yeah, I'm more intense and she's more cool cucumber, and we just like clashed.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: (Indiscernible) with an intenseness out there, like it's okay, reassure.  But once we figure out that, everything seemed to be start rolling the right way.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Exactly.   
 Q.  How much fourball had you played before this?  
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: We went to the last fourball as alternates and we made it past stroke play but lost in the match of 32, and then we tried to qualify the year before that and didn't make it.   
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Our goal for this year was make it past Monday.   
JILLIAN BOURDAGE: Just make it past Monday.  Get past what we did last year, and we definitely have.   
 Q.  You have.  
CASEY WEIDENFELD: Looks like we're doing pretty good.
