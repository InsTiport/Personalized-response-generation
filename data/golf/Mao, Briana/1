Q. Pretty good couple of days for you?
BRIANA MAO: Yeah.
Q. Mistake free today.  I know bogey free.
BRIANA MAO: Mistake free, yes.  I did have to scramble a couple of bad shots, but you know, that happens with every golf round.  No, today was just I knew I was putting well, and as long as I got on the green, doesn't matter where it was, my speed was really good.  So it was stress free, definitely.
Q. Is that something you kind of think about, just like fairways and greens?  I feel like that's what I think about.
BRIANA MAO: Yeah.  Like trying to hit as many greens as possible, and especially when it gets windy, wanting to hit the fairways, so the greens are starting to harden up and they're hard to hold.  So hitting fairways is definitely one thing that you're trying to do because some of the rough the lies aren't that great.  But no, overall, I mean it was nice the last couple of days, you know, just easy golf type of thing, fairway, green, putt, go on to the next hole.
Q. Did you think you made the eagle on 18?
BRIANA MAO: I knew I had the right line, but I knew it was going to be a little short.  I had good speed all day and I left that one putt short.  It's kind of like, really?
Q. That's what you were thinking as soon as you hit it?
BRIANA MAO: Yeah.  But I knew I read it right.  I've been reading the putts pretty decently, pretty well out here.  So you know, got two more days.  It's only the second day.  So what I can improve on, I will make those improvements the next two days.
