   JYOTI RANDHAWA:  I had not played a practice round here. I didn't even walk the course so this was my round this week - I guess I didn't see the trouble out there! To make no bogeys was very pleasing. I did play here last year so I pretty much knew how the greens were. 

 Q. Was not playing beforehand a deliberate thing as you needed the rest, or did you arrive late because of travel problems? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  I was just too tired after The Open Qualifying of 36 holes. I couldn't get up on Tuesday - I didn't get out of bed until 11.30 or 12. I just took it easy and watched a movie. Yesterday I hit some balls. 
 
 Q. Did you find Open Qualifying really intense? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  It was intense. Three under made it on that golf course in those conditions. I thought I played really well to finish on one under but it wasn't enough. 

 Q. But you are happy with the way you are playing? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  I have been having a good couple of weeks. My game is coming together so it's more of a mental battle now. Every time I just try to commit to my shot and stay focused. It's more mental than working on my swing. 

 Q. How do you find playing in this sort of weather? You can't be used to all this rain? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA: :  I think I am getting used to it. The last year I have played in Europe. I really had to work on my club selection in the wind and I have made a great improvement in that area. The greens are also different to Asia, but the more you putt on them the more you improve.
