 Q. After these two rounds, you must be delighted. 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA: Very delighted. Any time you shoot under par on this golf course, you have to take it. I played great yesterday and I did well today, too, to hang in there and make 2-under. So I'm really happy the way it went.

 Q. It's been probably a disappointing season for you so far, but a good result here this week could really kick-start for the rest of the season. 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA: I think I lost my putt a little bit in the middle part, but that's golf and it happens. I've got my swing together and good result. 

 Q. Three birdies today, 5, 14 and 15, which gave you the most pleasure? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA: I think 14 and 15 were the good ones. I think 14 was a better one because that got me to 1-under and that felt good and a birdie after that made it even better. So 14 was bet. 

 Q. As it stands at the moment, you're four shots off the lead but on this type of golf course it's a lead that can he evaporate very quickly, isn't it?
 JYOTI RANDHAWA: This course, just one or two bad shots you can easily end up with double. But four shots is four shots, it's quite a lot, and these days, everybody plays well. So you've got to putt -- as long as I keep posting those under-par numbers, anything can happen. So waiting for that. 

 Q. A little bit slower than expected perhaps yesterday? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA: They were really quick today, in fact, compared to yesterday they were really slow. Today they were really quick, so a few of the putts I misjudged and hit them too far and I thought the greens were quite good today.
