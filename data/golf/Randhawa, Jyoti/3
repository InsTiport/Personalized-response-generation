 Q.   5‑under after three rounds, three days in Hong Kong; if you would just sum up how the week has been for you here in Hong Kong.   
JYOTI RANDHAWA:   It's been great.   I've been improving as the week goes by.   So played a little better today, feel very comfortable with my game, and I scored well.   Maybe made one or two more birdies but 3‑under is 3‑under.   
   
 Q.   I think there's still a lot of golf to be played out there, especially with only a single shot separating you guys.   
JYOTI RANDHAWA:   I know, but yeah, I guess I just need to be playing the way I'm playing, just try and focus and try and do the best that I can like I did today.   You know, whatever happens, I'll take it, and I just need to focus on what I can do.   
   
 Q.   The season is obviously coming to a close; looking back, how would you rate this year for you?   
JYOTI RANDHAWA:   It's been great.   I haven't played most of the season, just taking it easy, shifting houses.   Now that I'm playing, I've started to play a little better and my form is coming back.   Hopefully have a good season ending and then look forward to next year.
