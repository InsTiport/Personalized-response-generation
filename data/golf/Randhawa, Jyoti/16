 Q.  Three birdies in a row, you must be pleased with that. 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  Definitely, coming in and making those three birdies was quite nice and quite satisfying.  Very happy with the way I finished, yeah. 

 Q.  Very pleased with where you are in the tournament? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  Yeah, I couldn't have asked better, one or two shots off the lead or maybe tied for the lead, something that you don't get very often.  So I'm very lucky to be there. 

 Q.  What was particularly good for you today? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  I think I managed the golf course quite well.  I didn't take unnecessary risks where I've been taking for the last two weeks.  Just playing within myself and very happy with the way I finished. 

 Q.  What about your plan for tomorrow, will you have to take some more of those risks you don't want to? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  I'll see after nine holes how the day is going and how I'm feeling.  But if I can stick to the same game plan, I think I shouldn't be too far off if I do the same thing. 

 Q.  Are you a guy that looks after yourself; there are a lot of names up there, but are you a leaderboard watcher? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  Yeah, I do that.  I do that and then I try and play my own game.  So, yeah, I do watch the leaderboard but it doesn't affect me much.  I'm very happy with what I get. 

 Q.  And you're not worried about the prospect of having to seal off the likes of Woods and Els? 
 JYOTI RANDHAWA:  I've played with Woods in China and the experience has been good.  It will be good if I can handle myself tomorrow.
