 Q.  Talking about the conditions? 

 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  The wind went into every different direction imagined today.  It was swirling.  On 12 you've got to snatch a club in a hurry or wait.  Timing is everything on that hole. 

 I'm glad to still be here.  The greens are tough.  11 is dead.  12 is nearly dead.  They need water.  They are getting thirsty.  I've got to shoot a couple of scores in the 60s to win. 

 Q.  In reference to putts. 

 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  You got to hit 'em easy.  I'm not used to putting that way.  It's hard. 

 This course is really hard. 

 Q.  In reference to Edwin Watts putter. 

 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  After a delicious dinner at Waffle House I put it back in my bag. 

 Q.  Par-5s. 

 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  I played them 3-under today.  That was the difference between today and yesterday.  I hit it good.
