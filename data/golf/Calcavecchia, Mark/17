 Q. Obviously there were ups and downs in the round, what part of your game was causing the most problems in the problem spots? 
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA: There were only three bogies. I had a bogey there from 90 yards with the easiest pin on the greens, so that was possibly wasting two shots right there. Couple of bad drives. 
 But I didn't make any putts today either. I made a bunch of putts the first two days, and I made no putts today. I mean none. The longest putt I made was six feet so that doesn't help.

 Q. So what is your plan going into tomorrow? 
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA: Just going to be aggressive and shoot as low as I can, finish as high as I can.
