Q.  Can you just talk about your round today? 
 
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   Well, it was a struggle.  The wind had me  -- the wind had me kind of messed up.  It came up on me on 6 and in mid-flight and I caught an up-shooter and ended up hitting to the front of the green and 3-putting.  And then on 7, 11, it dead-stopped just about the second I hit it and I air mailed the greens.  And as you know, if you air mail the greens here, you can forget it; and I was lucky to make bogeys.  That was about the story of the day.  The other one was the putt on 18, it was about a 10-footer.  Longest putt I made all day.  
 

Q.  Thoughts going into tomorrow?
 
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   I'm three back.  You know, I've still got a shot, obviously.  Chris has never won before.  I'm sure he'll be a little nervous.  He was in front of us today and looked like he was playing pretty good.  You know, I've just got to hope things go a little bit better tomorrow.  Just basically it.  Nothing really good happened to me today.  And as you know without a little luck in this game, you can forget it.
