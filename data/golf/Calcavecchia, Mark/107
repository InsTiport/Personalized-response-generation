MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  There's not much to say, except that Chris deserved to win.  He played well all day.  I had a chance with that last birdie attempt at 18 to finish alone in second, but it didn't work out.   It was his day today.  It was obviously a difficult day for me today.  I never seemed to get into rhythm.
