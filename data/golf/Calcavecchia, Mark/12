Q.   What did you think about the round today?
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   Well, it was quite a bit easier, obviously, today.   There was some good scores. 
Yesterday was just, yesterday afternoon was brutal.   With the wind, the greens were a lot firmer than they were this morning and faster.   And today they were a lot less wind from a different direction, so it was an entirely different course.   And the greens were quite a bit softer and slower.   So much more playable today, that's for sure. 
But to finish the round off good, I made some dumb mistakes on the front, but birdied three of the last four, so it was nice to finish that way.

Q.   Do you like your chances going into the weekend?
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   You never know what could happen out here.   You could get it going in the wrong way in a hurry on this course.   And we're only halfway done, long way to go, hopefully I won't be too far behind.   But I'm not sure which way the wind's going to go or how hard it's going to blow and that pretty much determines everything on this course.

Q.   Do you like this place a little better than yesterday?
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   Well, I think everybody does.   Even Tom Lehman, who usually has fun playing golf, he said that was the least amount of fun he's ever had golfing.   And for him to say that, you know, it was just ‑‑ good shots weren't rewarded.   That's the problem with a day like yesterday.   And that's the nature of this course. 
A couple instances out there one of us hit a really good iron shot that didn't turn out very good and then another hit a not so good shot that turned out better than we thought.   So who knows.
