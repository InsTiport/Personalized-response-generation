Q.
On Saturday you thought it was a ridiculous goal to play for your card, but you made it.  You must be pretty happy.
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  Yes, I am.  I'm especially happy with my effort.  I didn't hit the ball well on the front.  I don't know why.  I was trying to do the same things I've been doing the last two days, but I hung in there and made a few putts.  I hit a bad shot on 17, but all in all, I'm real happy with my effort and going to save my 25 career exemption for a year.
Q.  Talk about all the birdies you made on the back side.  It's kind of a fickle game.  When a guy like you gets on a roll, you must wonder where it's been for a while.
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  Yeah, I do.  It felt good.  I haven't strung three rounds together like this in a while.

I got a little bit of my confidence back, and that's good.  I'm very excited about next week.

I feel like I'm hitting the ball great and the putter feels good, so there's still one more week to turn this into a good year.
