 Q.  Mark, 63 today, you have to be happy with what you're doing out there. 
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  I played great today, better than the first two days, and continue to putt well.  I hit a lot of good iron shots, especially on the front nine.  Really the first 15 holes I played great, got a little sloppy at the end, but hung in there, and 63 is a great score anywhere, especially out here. 

 Q.  How would you size up your Sunday pairing with Tiger? 
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  It'll be fun.  I guess I'm three back, I'm not even sure.  Is that right?  He's 19 under.  So I've got to beat him by four tomorrow.  Not likely.  It could be a race for second.  Either way, the way he's playing is just phenomenal as we all know, and I'm playing good, too, so I'm going to have fun with it.  We're friends, and I'll make as many birdies as I can, just play the holes and play them the best I can and hopefully shoot a good score and you never know. 

 Q.  Throw some one-liners at him and get him laughing? 
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  Yeah, maybe I can throw his concentration off a little bit, I doubt it.  We'll have fun.  As I said, we're friends and we talk all the time. 
 I'll be looking forward to it.  Good opportunity for me to see what I've got. 

 Q.  When was the last time you shot 16-under par through three rounds and weren't in first place? 
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  Probably at the Hope (laughing), probably somewhere out there, Tucson maybe, I don't know.  You know, I had never played this golf course any good until the last couple rounds two years ago and kind of really decided I liked it.  And this year with the greens, I actually liked them when I saw them on Tuesday and I knew I was going to make some putts on these greens.  I love them. 
 Great job to the staff, and see you tomorrow (smiling).
