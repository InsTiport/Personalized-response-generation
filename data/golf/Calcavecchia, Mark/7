 Q.   With Mark Calcavecchia.   You shot 1 under today, 3 under par total for the championship.   Can you talk about your round a little bit, just overall thoughts.  
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   Probably played a little bit better than I did the other two days, made no putts again.   Had a 3 under through 10, making nothing.  
Missed a four‑footer on 11 and a five‑footer on 14, and then didn't birdie 15.  
   
 Q.   Is there something specific with the way the greens are?  
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   I just can't read them.   They're slow as shit.   Just you can't get it to the hole uphill.   It's impossible.   I mean, I've left a couple of ten‑footers slightly uphill short.   I don't do that.   So they're just dirt slow.  
   
 Q.   Thank you.
