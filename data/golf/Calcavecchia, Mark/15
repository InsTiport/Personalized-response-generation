  Q. If you could, just tell me your thoughts about your year so far, any highlights?  
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA: It's been a really good year. I'm a Champions Tour player now and finally got my first win, so that's good news. Had 15 Top 10s out of 22 tournaments, so it was a good, consistent year. I didn't have many bad days, and that's good.  
 The highlight of my year, that would be the win in Seattle.  
  
  Q. If you could, tell me your thoughts about the possibility of winning the Charles Schwab Cup and how you feel about ending at TPC Harding Park.   
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA: The first part of that question is I'm very excited to have a chance to win it. I think if I win the tournament, unless Tom finishes solo second, I'll win the thing.   
 So I know if I go out and win the thing I got a pretty good chance of winning, so that's exciting. That's the good news.  
 As far as Harding Park goes, it's not one of my favorites. I finished tied for dead last there last year, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. There are some other courses we've played this year that I did horrible at last year.   
 And I'm playing good. I'm hitting the ball good. I remember last year I had a tough time there putting. But for the most part, I've putted well also this year many. Looking forward to it.
