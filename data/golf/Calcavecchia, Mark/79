Q.  How are you feeling and what happened?

MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   To make a long story short, I got pushed in a pool, throwing back a little basketball back to the kids who were shooting hoop.  I was by the edge of the hoop and got pushed, I had my cell phone in my pocket, fully clothed and everything.  I tried to save myself, grabbed the side of the backboard and I swung around.  My best guess is I just caught the rim flush with my wrist and my forearm, and then I hit my knee on the side of the pool. 

So, you know  -- my back doesn't feel too good, either.  This course is hard enough.  It actually felt fine.  I only played four holes yesterday, hit no balls because it was starting to swell up worse.  It's gotten worse day by day.  It was really pretty good today until the eighth hole.  Then it started hurting pretty much on every shot.  It's not killer, but I'm anxious for a bag of ice right now, I'll tell you that.


Q.  Was there any point out there where you thought you might not be able to make it? 

MARK CALCAVECCHIA:   No, definitely not.  But if I keep hitting it in the rough, that's not good.  They say it's going to be worse tomorrow, so I'm a little worried about tomorrow.  I'll fight through it somehow. 

You know, the good news is, I'm just going to try as hard as I can.  If I miss the cut, I'll have that extra couple of days to rest before I try to tackle Firestone next week. 

Trying as hard as I can, and like I said, I would love to play good and start making putts all over the place and get interested.  But on the other hand, it's pretty tough to hit it with this.  It hurts.
