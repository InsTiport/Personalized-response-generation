  Q. 6-under for the tournament, had to be kind of tough. We heard on Wednesday that the knee was bugging you pretty bad in the Pro-Am?  
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA: Yeah, it was. I was on the 13th hole and I thought that was it. I was ready to go down.   
 But I guess when you're mentally prepared to play 27 holes, as bad as it was yesterday afternoon or last night, when we played nine holes, it helped, because 36 would have killed me. I guess I knew I had a long road to go, so I never thought about it until the last few holes.
