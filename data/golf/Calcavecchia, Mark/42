  Q.  Just talk about the last few holes; you had a lot of bad breaks.   
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  Yeah, didn't go my way.  Wasn't my time.  I hit it in the water three times.  I said yesterday I needed to keep my ball dry, and if I would have done that, it would have been a different story.   
  
  Q.  Just talk about 15.  Watching the ball and then what happened on the second shot.   
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  Thought I hit a great shot off the tee.  The wind held it up a little bit.  The bunker shot, I hit a little further than I wanted to, but I thought it was a pretty good bunker shot and the thing didn't grab, downgrain, downwind and went right for the water.   
 I don't know, too much sand in the bunkers or something; I had a buried lie every spot I could find.   
  
  Q.  What did you expect?   
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  I thought I was on the green the whole time.  I never thought in my mind it was in the bunker.  When I hit it, I thought I hit a great shot.  Thought I was going to be on left side of the green 25 feet in the hole.  Wind just blew it left and hit on the fringe or wherever it hit and rolled in the bunker.   
 I actually kind of spun it and thought I hit it pretty good, and I really wasn't trying to fly it that far.  But when I hit it, I thought it was a pretty good bunker shot.  I certainly never dreamed it would run into the water, and it just didn't grab and just kept rolling and rolling and rolling and that was it.   
  
  Q.  I know you obviously wanted to win here, just talk about how do you view the overall finish?   
 MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  Happy if I didn't make six on the last hole.  That's never fun.  One hop, buried that in the bunker, too.  You know, I guess tie for fourth, but I was looking for the W.
