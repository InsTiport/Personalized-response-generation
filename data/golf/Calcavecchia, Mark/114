TERRY CONLON:  On behalf of the Canon Greater Hartford Open and Lux, Bond and Green our great hole-in-one sponsor on the 5th hole, we'd like to present this Rolex watch to you.  Congratulations. 
 
MARK CALCAVECCHIA:  Thank you, sir, it's beautiful.  Could be the highlight of my year; 80th on the money list or whatever I am.  I hit it just terrible the first four holes; didn't get a good shot. Just got up there and fired.  I knew it was downwind. I hit a 4-iron 218.  It turned out it was just one of those things; it was a perfect shot.  It was a big thrill, and it's always exciting to do that.  I missed a couple of short putts, and I'm like, well, I guess I did hole out a 4-iron.  I can't complain too much.  I'd like to thank the Jaycees and Canon and everybody here at Hartford and Lux, Bond and Green.  I just love coming here and playing.  I've see that sign up there quite a few years in a row; so, I'm glad I was the one to get it.  Anyway, it's a big thrill, and thanks very much.  (Applause.)
