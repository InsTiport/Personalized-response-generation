BLAIR STOCKETT: Her coach and caddie had to pick a flight, so we didn't know how the timing would line up, but just be ready in case.  So when they finished around lunch break, I marked a couple pens in my book and came out just in case.  Hole 15 I guess was when he needed to leave, so I just jumped on, kept her calm.  I knew she had it in her.  It was pretty cool.
Q. This is your home course?
BLAIR STOCKETT: Yes, it is.
Q. What kind of advantage, other than the obvious, does that help with her?
BLAIR STOCKETT: I just think the putt on 18, 17, little subtle breaks like that, you saw how much that putt broke a little bit more than it probably looks, so I think maybe that helped her a little bit.  But hey, she's a great player.  That was all her.
Q. Did you have to convert anything for meters at all for her?
BLAIR STOCKETT: Yeah, so that was a little bit of a hurdle.  I actually didn't even realize she would be playing meters, so on 15 we talked that through a little bit, decided on 4-iron, and I kind of helped her with the pin, how much over the bunker she had to work with, and she hit that perfect.
Q. On this one I saw you lean over to her right when she was looking over her putt.  What did you say to her?
BLAIR STOCKETT: I just said, it's going to break more than you think.  And you saw, she hit it with perfect speed, so yeah, incredible putt.
