 Q.  What was the excitement level of making a 50-foot birdie putt from off the green on No. 17?  
SCOTT HARVEY: It was a great. I was aware of the scores and where we (USA) stand. Spider (Miller) came to me on (No.) 16 and said we need a point. And I said, ?I will do it captain.? I tried to play in front of the green and make four and make him beat me. Sometimes they go in.?   
 Q.  What does it feel like to play in this competition for the first time as a mid-amateur and get a point?  
SCOTT HARVEY: I definitely had it in my mind that I didn?t want to come over here as a mid-am and just go zero for the week. Even though it?s not solely about winning you really want to prove a point, at least in my mind. To come away with a victory is a huge boost of confidence for me.
