Q. Scott, you had a long morning before you even hit the course for match play, earning that last spot in the field of 64.  What happened?  We heard you were out there for four hours this morning.
SCOTT HARVEY: Yeah, it was about seven holes I believe it was in the playoff, and I think like I said, it took every bit of four hours, and it felt like 10.  Play a hole and then wait for the rest of the people to finish, see what happened, and then regroup, keep going, do it again.  Yeah, it was a long, grinding morning, but we made it through.
Q. 23 players for eight spots; what was the tension like out there?
SCOTT HARVEY: I mean, it was pretty intense to begin with, but then literally after you played the first hole you waited an hour and 15 minutes or something, so all that kind of went away and you just played golf after that.
Q. You're the 2014 Mid-Am champion.  You know what it takes to win a USGA championship.  What will it take this week?
SCOTT HARVEY: A lot of grinding.  This course is tough and long, and a lot of grinding and have to putt really well and hit a lot of fairways.  Match play is a different animal, so yeah, it's going to be a long, tough week.  Hopefully we can get through the first match.  I'm pretty exhausted.  Been a long day already, so if I can grind this one out, I think I'll be in good shape.
