Q.   Wanted to get your thoughts on your amazing round of 64 today. 
JEFF FREEMAN:   Thank you.   I finally got the putter working today.   When you make putts it's easier to hit it well.   When you're not making any you're trying so hard to hit it close so you can tap them in. 
But, no, everything was working today.   I started making some putts and hit it good. 

Q.   Your thoughts on the conditions today?   Different than the rest of the tournament?
JEFF FREEMAN:   Pretty much the same.   It's in great condition, the golf course is.   It was just very hard for me to read the putts the first three days.   Finally had a caddie that read them today.   He gets all the credit. 

Q.   So any thoughts on coming back in 2014?
JEFF FREEMAN:   I would love to.   I hope I'm still exempt for the TOUR.   I turned 50 this year and I missed seven events already, but if I can play well the rest of the time, hopefully I'll be exempt.
