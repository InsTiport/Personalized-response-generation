  Q. Rich, tough finish. Actually very nice up-and-down for a tough finish there at 18. But talk about your day. All in all you gotta be pretty happy with things after a Thursday.   
 RICH BEEM: Yeah, absolutely. That's my first round in the 60s in a very, very, very long time, and I'm talking about even being back at home playing with my buddies.   
 So it was good out there. I struggled the last three holes. They were playing tough, back in the wind, and I had a pretty good size mud ball on 18 that just kind of darted on me on the second shot and tried to hit too good of a third shot, but that's what happens.  
  
  Q. The last event of every year, everybody's got different stories coming in this week. Yours is a little different than everybody else's. Just being out here playing right now has gotta feel pretty good.   
 RICH BEEM: It does. I'm actually kind of treating this as my first tournament of the year, you know. I mean I played in Vegas, and I don't really remember a whole lot about that except for, yeah, it was bad.   
 But I got here this week and had some really good practice rounds, and just wanted to kind of treat this as the first tournament towards next year because that's essentially what it is.  
  
  Q. Well, it was a great thrill getting to watch you play. It was good to see you out there. I know you got a lot of fans, and we're happy to see you back out on the golf course. Congratulations.   
 RICH BEEM: Thank you very much. Good to be back.
