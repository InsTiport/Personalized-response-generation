  Q. Rich, solid 68 today. Iron play seems to be the best part of your game this week.  
 RICH BEEM: I think it's a little bit of everything. I think the iron play, it's kind of set up by me driving the ball a little bit better this week. Yeah, everything is clicking quite nicely this week, I must say.  
  
  Q. What is it about this course that you really like? You seem to be playing well.  
 RICH BEEM: I think you got to strike the ball fairly well on this golf course and can't quite smack it around. You've got to put yourself in position off the tee box. The greens are small, and you've got to have some quality iron shots to give yourself some birdie chances. The golf course is in great shape. You hit in it fairway, you should get a great lie off the zoysia fairways.  
  
  Q. You were at the hospital on Tuesday for the event. What about this tournament do you love? How does it feel to help the St. Jude's and all those kids?  
 RICH BEEM: It was fantastic going to the hospital this Tuesday. Seeing the smiles on the kids' faces, knowing the diseases they're fighting, seeing the smiles on the families' faces, it's pretty incredible. They're wishing me good luck. All I can think about is the fight they're going through right now. I'm glad to have the opportunity to go.
