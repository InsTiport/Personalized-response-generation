  Q.  Comment on your round today for us.   
 RICH BEEM:  Oh, it was a battle out there today.  I felt really good out there all day.  I really felt in control and I just battled back after a couple bogeys on 8 and 9.  8 just caught me all week, bogeyed that four straight days.  What a nightmare.   
 But, I battled back and I put myself in decent position to maybe make a few birdies down the stretch and I just didn't do it.  I missed the putt on 16, I don't know what that was; unfortunate is what it was.   
 Yeah, I took one for the U.S. Presidents Cup Team trying to get out there to Baker-Finch on 18, almost took him out.  But anyway, sounds like he's okay, but.   
  
  Q.  Take out the nicest guy in golf.   
 RICH BEEM:  Yeah, CBS is going to want me for life; "You destroyed one of our best guys!"   
 No, I think he'll be all right.  Luckily I didn't catch him on the, fly but still, to get hit by a golf ball coming that hard can't feel any good.   
  
  Q.  Positive note, you were in contention all week.   
 RICH BEEM:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  You moved up and looks like you're in next week.   
 RICH BEEM:  Yeah, I'm in next week.  I can't imagine not being in next week.  But I've got next week to go and now I've going to go out next week and play just as hard and hopefully get myself back in the position again to play in Chicago.   
  
  Q.  What kind of pressure is that?  It's almost like you have that 125, keep-your-card push constantly?   
 RICH BEEM:  You know, I don't really think of it that way.  Because of the Playoffs, you know if you don't play well you're going to get eliminated so you've got to play hard so I don't find my extra pressure.  Kind of look forward to it, because you know you've got to go out and play well.  It doesn't bother me that much.
