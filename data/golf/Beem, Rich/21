  Q.  Regarding the course conditions.   

 RICH BEEM:  It was like trying to land a golf ball on your driveway, but your driveway has mounds on them and they stick the pin near the mounds.   

 Sometimes you just have to giggle about it....   

 The wind was blowing from all different directions.   

 Look at those drives on No. 1.  Those guys are going to be hitting 4- and 3-irons and hybrids into that green.  Best of luck, I'm glad I'm done.   
  
  Q.  They are saying over par will win this week.   

 RICH BEEM:  Yes.  (Nodding his head.)
