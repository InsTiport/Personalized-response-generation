Q. 5-under par today.  Take me through your round.  What was working well for you?
MADALENE SAGSTROM: I've really, really putted awesome today.  I've been working hard on my putting this week.  We've had our putting guy here.  So I just really found the roll on the greens today.  I made par when I needed to and made a lot of really good par saves, and I made some birdies when I had the opportunities.
I just took all of the chances I had, because I had a few, and I also saved when I needed to.
Q. Was there any particularly long putts?
MADALENE SAGSTROM: On 11, I made a 30-footer, which was nice.  Those are always nice to get.  But I made a bunch of like 15-footers for par.  So those are nice that they roll in, for sure.
Q. How does it feel to be playing so well, put yourself in contention, heading into the final day of a major?
MADALENE SAGSTROM: I mean, it feels good obviously.  It's my first year out here, so I'm trying to figure everything out and trying to see kind of where my game is at.  I'm still going to go work on some things because it's not all there, but it's just nice to see some results of all the hard work I'm putting down and just see that I can be up there, for sure.
