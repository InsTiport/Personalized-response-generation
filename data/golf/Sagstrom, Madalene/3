 Q.  Congratulations on a lovely round of 67.  You went to great lengths to keep a bogey off the scorecard today?  
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Yeah, I did.  I scrambled a few times.  It was a great day.  I hit my irons really well.   
 Q.  Tied for third last week and first page of the leaderboard today.  What's going so right?  
MADELENE SAGSTROM: I think I putt a little bit too much pressure on myself throughout the year, and right now I'm at the point where I've achieved all my goals for the season.  So I'm kind of relaxed and I can just go out and play my game and have fun and I'm trusting my swing.  Just playing out here, it's amazing.  Everything that we do in Asia is fantastic.   
It was a big start for me as a rookie.  Making it to the Asian tournaments has been a huge goal and I'm super excited.
