 Q.  You just came off a fantastic last week.  How did you feel coming in?  Did you feel like you could really make a run at it today?  
MADELENE SAGSTROM: Yeah, absolutely.  I came here, and I liked the course right away.  I like the setup and the layout over here.  The heat's a little bit too hot, but I mean, it reminds me of Florida where I live.  I liked everything coming in, and I had a good feeling coming off last week, absolutely.   
 Q.  Bogey-free round today.  What's your strategy for the rest of the tournament now?  
MADELENE SAGSTROM: This is my last tournament in Asia before the Tour final.  I'm just going to try to do everything to finish strong and play my game all week.  I know I'm hitting the ball really well, especially the irons right now.  So I'm just going to go out and give it my best and finish the season strong.   
 Q.  Any goal in term of placing?  
MADELENE SAGSTROM: No, I never really have goals placing.  Just like if I stick to my game plan and I play my game, it should be pretty good.  And if it's not, it's not.  I'm just going to go out and do my best and keep working on the things we're working on.  Just stay a little bit mellow this week and try not to fluctuate too much in the temper and just enjoy it.
