 >Q. What happened on the way in?  They tell me you were going to take the stroll from 9?CLAYTON RASK: Yeah, I had family, friends.  They all met up at scoring with me.  I asked the official, is there another shuttle to get people out?  Yeah, we should be able to get everyone.  So I bring everyone over.  And then the guy tells us, they can only go if they have player guest badges.  I said if they're not going, I'll walk in with them, since they walked with me all day.  So we made the stroll in together.  If they couldn't go with me there, I wasn't going to take a ride and let them hang.  We celebrated with the walk in, and it was fun.
Q. You came in all the way from 9?CLAYTON RASK: Yes.
Q. On foot?CLAYTON RASK: Yes.
Q. With the family?CLAYTON RASK: Family, friends, yeah.
Q. How much fun was that knowing that you'll be here for the weekend, what was that experience like?CLAYTON RASK: Awesome.  Had goosebumps numerous times coming in. First time out, I said I knew I can play with these guys.  And to make the cut and finish strong, just kind of caps it off for me knowing that I've got a chance.  And I'm going to try to do the best to cap it off, too.
Q. For the weekend, what's the mission?CLAYTON RASK: Probably play as good as I can, take it low, but still play smart and have fun, as we've been doing.  That was the main goal.  Have fun this week.  Take it all in.  It's just another round of golf on a really awesome golf course with thousands of people.  It's what I dreamed about doing as a kid.  Hard work, dedication and perseverance is starting to pay off.  I'm just going to take it in and have fun.
