 Q.  Back in the semifinals for the first time since '15.  
SCOTT HARVEY: Yeah.   
 Q.  Just give me your overall thoughts about that, the last day of the Championship?  
SCOTT HARVEY: The first thing comes to my mind is we don't have to qualify for next year.   
TODD MITCHELL: Yeah, working that out somewhere, you know.   
SCOTT HARVEY: Meeting in Narnia to qualify.  Where can you fly?  Where's easy for you?   
 Q.  You guys live in different parts of the country.  
SCOTT HARVEY: We've been from Virginia to Kansas, you know.   
TODD MITCHELL: Then up to Chicago last year and whatever.   
SCOTT HARVEY: St. Louis.   
TODD MITCHELL: Yeah, but whatever.  That's the one thing.  We've been here before and want to get a little further this time.   
 Q.  Obviously, seemed like the turning point was heat today.  You guys got back with the birdie there and kind of turned the match around at that point.  Par 3.  
SCOTT HARVEY: .  8, and then 10, two out of three holes there were huge.   
 Q.  How long were your putts on 8 and 10, and who made them?  
TODD MITCHELL: He made it on 8 from about 12 feet.   
SCOTT HARVEY: And he made it on 10 from 40 or so, is that right?   
TODD MITCHELL: I don't know.  It was off the green to the left.   
 Q.  Okay.  Flagstick in?  
SCOTT HARVEY: Oh, yeah.   
TODD MITCHELL: It wouldn't have mattered.  It was a great play.   
 Q.  Obviously, just kind of -- I think you had another birdie on 15?  
SCOTT HARVEY: 15 and --   
 Q.  Is that the par 5?  
SCOTT HARVEY: And 13 as well.   
 Q.  13 and 15.  What happened on 13 and 15?  
TODD MITCHELL: I don't remember.   
SCOTT HARVEY: 13, went to about eight feet and made it.  You got it off the cart path and birdie.   
TODD MITCHELL: On 15, yeah.  So, look, the wind blew a lot harder out there this afternoon, and the greens were drawing out big time, getting a little crusty, and it played extremely difficult.  So we were very pleased with how we played.   
SCOTT HARVEY: I don't know how many birdies we made, but it was a lot.   
 Q.  You finally made your first bogey.  71 holes without a bogey?  
SCOTT HARVEY: I missed a little 3 1/2 footer, whatever.  Shouldn't have happened, but it did.  There's some that should have happened, but didn't.  So --   
TODD MITCHELL: Right.   
 Q.  You guys have much different conditions today than you did yesterday?  
SCOTT HARVEY: Oh, God.   
TODD MITCHELL: Yeah.   
SCOTT HARVEY: The wind this afternoon was drastically different.   
 Q.  20 miles an hour, the guy said?  
TODD MITCHELL: At least.   
SCOTT HARVEY: Another ten out by the water.  Hitting 8 irons from 120.   
 Q.  Welcome to British golf.  
SCOTT HARVEY: Yeah.   
 Q.  So now, obviously, tomorrow potentially another long day.  Looks like you won't have to play another Mid-Am champ.  I think Parziale, they're going to get beat.  They're 3 down with three to play.  
SCOTT HARVEY: We played our practice rounds with Matt and Herb.  We were looking forward to, hoping to get back out there with them, but whatever.   
 Q.  Face whatever's in front of you.  You guys know the drill, right?  
SCOTT HARVEY: He's probably got a little hangover match after today.   
 Q.  I think they made nine birdies or eight birdies in that match.  Yeah.  How do you guys feel about yourselves?  How are you holding up physically?  These courses aren't easy to walk.  
TODD MITCHELL: I felt it out there.  And obviously, now and then until we go to sleep and all that.  But, you know, adrenaline's a big thing.  About the time you get to the practice center and start going, then things, you know, our feet hurt and all that.  When you start going, you don't really think about it, you know.   
 Q.  You're right there for the chance tomorrow.  That's all you can do?  
TODD MITCHELL: That's all we can ask for right now is just to keep playing the way that we are.   
 Q.  Right.  
TODD MITCHELL: Minimized our mistakes and capitalized on some things, and most of all, though, we've really played solid, you know.   
 Q.  You got to in these matches.  You can't -- I mean, one bad stretch of holes, and you're going home.  
SCOTT HARVEY: Yeah, yeah.   
TODD MITCHELL: It's tough out there too.  You get the wrong side of some of these pins -- I mean, this is hard.  That's all there is to it.  Just hard.   
 Q.  Get a taste of it next year for the amateur.  It's going to be here.  
SCOTT HARVEY: It is, isn't it?   
 Q.  The other two courses.  
SCOTT HARVEY: Yeah, interesting.
