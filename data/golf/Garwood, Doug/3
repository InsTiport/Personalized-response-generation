 Q.  Great round, 6 under.  What was (indiscernible)?  
DOUG GARWOOD: Well, I was putting well.  I liked the greens.  They feel good to me.  I can see the breaks real well.  Made most of the putts.  I did miss about a 2-footer, but that was the green.  It took a sharp veer on me.   
So the putter, and I hit it decent enough to put myself in position to make birdies with putts.   
 Q.  Are you the kind of guy who looks at the scoreboard and says okay, we're starting this way, then I see some guys at 5 under, I think it's out there, I'm going to try to do it?  
DOUG GARWOOD: I did this morning.  I looked at the website just to see if guys were scoring, and I saw that they were.  So I knew that.  But after that, it's just golf for me.   
 Q.  Is it a premium to you on hitting it in the fairway so you can get to the greens, or is it the second shot in?  
DOUG GARWOOD: Well, it's all important.  You got to hit the fairway.  Once you do that, then you got to hit the green, and then you got to make the putt.  So really, just every shot, I'm trying to hit my best.   
 Q.  Do you have any familiarity with the golf course at all?  Was this the first time?  
 A. The first time here.   
 Q.  Do you like the Ross course?  
DOUG GARWOOD: Yeah, I like the layout.  It seems to favor the fade a little bit, which is what I do.  And I'm pretty comfortable in it.   
 Q.  With this score in your pocket, what's your mindset for tomorrow now?  
DOUG GARWOOD: Get some rest and come back out and do it again.  It's still early.
