Q. Couple of good holes to start, and then things turned a little bit for you.
DOUG GARWOOD: I bogeyed the first two, actually, yeah.  No, I had a poor start, a couple of bogeys, settled down, made some birdies, played decent after that.  Birdied 14, bogeyed 15.  17 was playing tough.  The wind was going every which way.
18, you know, occasionally I shank a ball.  I finished second at Pebble my first year with four shanks.  So just the way my swing works.  It happens occasionally.  It just happened in a fairly poor place.
Q. How's your back holding up?
DOUG GARWOOD: Good.  No excuses.
Q. Considering how you've been playing, do you have another deeper round in your bag, do you think, for tomorrow?
DOUG GARWOOD: Never know.  Just whatever shows up.  Hopefully, it will be a good one.
Q. Talk a little bit about the play of the leaders.  What do you think about that?
DOUG GARWOOD: It was impressive.  I thought it was playing tough.  The wind was blowing harder than any day we've had.  It seemed to be swirling all over the place.  It's tough to get it close to the hole, I thought.
I didn't play -- I righted the ship, but I really wasn't having a lot of birdie opportunities.  So I was impressed that they kept making birdies.
Q. The fact that the wind's come up later in the competition, does that make it harder to deal with because the pressure's intensified?
DOUG GARWOOD: Well, I just think it's harder to play good golf in high winds.  I imagine the scoring average was probably higher today, although you had a different size field.  But it just makes it a little tougher when it's blowing 16 versus 10.
