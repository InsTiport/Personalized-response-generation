ANNE VAN DAM: I feel bad about the bogey on 18.
Q. Overall, obviously the goal --
ANNE VAN DAM: Overall, if I said at the beginning of the week I would play Top-10 here, I'll take it.  But yeah, I felt like there was definitely more into it this week than that.  But that's golf.  You don't always get what you think you can.
Q. You said it was a two-year sort of goal to get on the team.
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, for sure.  It's a great feeling knowing that I'll be going and represent Europe.  It's just mixed feelings because it was just a regular LPGA this event, of course, as well.
Q. You're still okay for the LPGA card?
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, of course.  This will give me a huge boost up the rankings.  I have four more events that count from the regular season.  So just try to play as well as I can in those four.
Q. What's your schedule before Solheim?
ANNE VAN DAM: Canada and Portland.
Q. So you are heading to Gleneagles tomorrow?
ANNE VAN DAM: Yes.
Q. And Canada straight from there?
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, I go home and then to Canada.
Q. You'll be the second Dutch player.  Were you friends with her?
ANNE VAN DAM: We grew up in different times playing.  She was already a pro when I was an amateur.  We didn't play that much together, but I know her a little bit and I think it's great for Holland to have another player in the Solheim Cup.
Q. What were your inspirations growing up playing golf?
ANNE VAN DAM: Probably Annika Sorenstam for sure.  She's the greatest female golfer of all time.
Q. Have you spoken to anybody about Solheim?
ANNE VAN DAM: No.
Q. What to expect and things like that?
ANNE VAN DAM: Oh, really -- for me, there was no point of talking to anyone until I qualified.  Yeah, I think now I can.
Q. Did Catriona speak to you at all?
ANNE VAN DAM: No.  I haven't talked to her at all for a single moment until this morning actually.  For me, I have to play as well as I can until this week, and after that, it's just for me, there's no need to ask where I'm at in the standings or whatever.
