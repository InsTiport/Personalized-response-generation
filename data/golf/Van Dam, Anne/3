Q. I know it's always difficult when you come off of a defeat, but perhaps put into words what the emotions are like after that battle.
ANNE VAN DAM: Yes, it's important for both. We would love to get half a point or at least a point. We had a few gimmes out there. I felt like I didn't play my best today. Suzann played some amazing golf, strong winds. And what can I say, just really tough. It can fall either way and they just did a little better than we did.
Q. They just did a little better, Suzann, but would it possible have been enjoyed seeing the battle went to and fro through the match?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: If you had told me I was going to go play golf in these conditions I would have told no. But if I could say I enjoyed it, yeah, I loved it. That's what this is all about. You kind of forget about the conditions and you just play what you get.
And it was tough. It was really, really tough and it's just I mean you just try to control the ball coming down to the end and a few errors from both of us kind of let that slip away. But you know what we made them work for it. We got them to 18 and you lose some and you win some. And I think we played pretty good. Very, very tough conditions.
