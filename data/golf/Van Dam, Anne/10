Q. A two-shot lead, how would you assess your day?
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, it was a bit up and down.  There were quite some good things also.  On some little shots I struggled a little bit, but I would say overall, 2-under is fine today.
Q. You got off to a great start, didn't you.  A couple of birdies early on.
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, I got off to a really nice start.  I birdied 2 and 3 to go 2-under, and after that I hit a couple of decent shots.  My tee shots were not so good on the front nine but my iron game was pretty good.
But I didn't really hole that many putts on the front, and then unfortunately I had a 3-putt on 8.  Got me back to 1-under.
And then on the back nine, I would say towards the end, I got better off the tee.  Just some poor irons.  But yeah, also subpoena good up-and-downs.  It was a bit of everything today.
Q. Plenty of good rounds out there today, one from Angel Yin.  We discussed this on a previous day about you two wanting to play again with each other, and you'll be doing that tomorrow.  Looking forward to that, I'm sure.
ANNE VAN DAM: Yeah, definitely.  I think she likes me so much.  She kicked her own ass this morning saying she needed a low one, and I think it's really impressive.
It's quite windy out there.  I don't know what she had, 7-under, 8-under, something like that, so it's pretty good.  Should be fun to play again with her tomorrow and should be a great battle, definitely.
