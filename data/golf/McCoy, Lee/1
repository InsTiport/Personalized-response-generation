 Q.  The position you're in, seems like the morning guys have started to make the moves in the scores over the last three days, and the afternoon has been the problem.  
LEE McCOY: It's tough.  You know, you could easily say that it would have been better to be 1- or 2-under just to get an hour earlier start.  The wind started picking up for us around 6 or 7, and once it starts picking up with the pins they had out there today, it's hard to get easy looks.  They are not going to be there.  You can't hit the ball high enough in this wind to control the distance.  So I guess I don't feel like I should have shot 3-over.  I feel like I hit the ball way too well to shoot 74.
