 Q.   Matt, talk about the round.   You think you got a little bit of a break going out this morning?   Looks like the wind is going to kick up.   
    MATT THOMPSON:   No, in the morning it's definitely a little easier, not having to second‑guess yourself on each shot, you feel like.  
    Today was good.   I just played solid.   I was putting really well, made a lot of really good putts, and just go try to figure it out again tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Some of the guys said the course may be playing a little easier than they thought this morning?  
    MATT THOMPSON:   Yeah, the greens are a little softer than I think Jack probably wants.   But then again this course is tough.   The greens are really tough.   You have to be careful on the downhillers.   It's supposed to be windy all weekend, so that should be enough, I think, to keep the scores up a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Was there a moment that got you rolling today or was it pretty much a work in project?  
    MATT THOMPSON:   I think my birdie on 18 was kind of the jump start.   I birdied 18 then 1, 3, and eagled 5.   That got me going.   The birdie on 18 was kind of cool.   It was like a 15‑footer, but it broke about four feet.   Those are always fun to make.   I don't know, it just kind of got me excited a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Obviously can't win on the first day, but you can lose it here.   Your thoughts going into Round 2?  
    MATT THOMPSON:   You know, just going to try to hit a lot of fairways and give myself chances on the greens.   I feel like I'm hitting the ball solid if I can get it in the fairway off the tee, which shouldn't be too tough.   The fairways here are fairly wide compared to most courses we play.   If I can do that I'll give myself a chance to make a lot of birdies and hopefully have a similar round tomorrow.
