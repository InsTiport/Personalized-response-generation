 Q.  Just take me through what happened on the last one.  
LAUREN KIM: Standing in the fairway, there was a little mud on my ball, but after we talked about it I was okay with the club we were hitting. Had 177, I believe, so kind of long.   
Pulled 5-iron and then just tugged it a little bit. But I don't actually think that bunker is that bad. Where to hit it like rolled into a little groove where it looked like somebody had raked it.   
So the lie wasn't great. I was like, okay, I had to like hit it to get it out pretty hard. Just caught too little sand, came over here, and then, yeah, just didn't hit the chip well. That's how doubles happen. (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Is there an emphasis then for you tomorrow on tomorrow and just kind of getting everything back in line and back going the right direction?  
LAUREN KIM: I think, yeah, it's tough because mentally for today I thought we were going to be later, so waking up this morning the turnaround was kind of quick. Got a good warm-down yesterday.   
I mean, it's hard to shoot 5-under every day so I'm not really expecting that. Was kind of fighting today, and hopefully can get a good one tomorrow. I think in four rounds of golf, eight rounds of golf, you're going to have a couple that are not so great.   
Yeah, not too bummed. Just would've liked to finish at 1-under instead of 1-over, especially going into the last hole. It's not a terribly difficult hole, so a little disappointed.   
But, I mean, still have five rounds left.
