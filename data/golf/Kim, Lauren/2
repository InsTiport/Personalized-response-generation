 Q.  Fair to say it's coming at a good time.  
LAUREN KIM: Yeah, especially the way the rounds have been trending. Coming at a good time, yeah.   
 Q.  What do you do the next couple days to kind of regroup?  
LAUREN KIM: I don't know. I think tomorrow, a lot of rest tomorrow and then get back into it probably Monday, Tuesday. I haven't decided what I'm going to do tomorrow yet. We'll see.   
 Q.  When you look at the last couple days, especially just finishing like that, is that something you think about or try to eliminate?  
LAUREN KIM: Try to eliminate. I mean, I'm still right in it. I don't think I gave too much away. Just really disappointment to not get an under-par round back today after yesterday.   
So, yeah, just keeping my head in it and not getting too far ahead of myself positively or negatively. Yeah, still four more rounds. A lot can happen.   
Yeah, just hoping to prepare the best I can and see what happens.
