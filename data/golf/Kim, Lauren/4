Q. How far was the chip-in?
LAUREN KIM: I was trying to land it 11 yards on to the green front edge, so it was probably about 15, something like that.
Q. What did you use?
LAUREN KIM: 58-degree wedge.
Q. Nice.
LAUREN KIM: Opened it up and hoped that the bermuda doesn't get it. (Laughter.)
Q. A definition of your day, or how did it go out there?
LAUREN KIM: A little bit. Kind of just stayed patient. I think I was 3-under through I want to say just past 9 or something like that, and made a few pars. Missed a few opportunities actually, which is kind of amazing when you have a round 5-under and you feel like you left some out there.
But it's all good stuff. I mean, it's funny. With Jeff, my caddie and I, we were just joking around that I actually had it chip today. Yesterday I missed two greens and both were in the bunker. I was out on the green yesterday afternoon just practicing the rough and stuff because from California we don't have bermuda.
So, yeah, it worked. Chipping well today. Hopefully can continue tomorrow.
Q. When you put yourself in this position after two rounds, how does it feel? Playing a lot golf obviously.
LAUREN KIM: Yeah, a lot confidence going into the next six rounds. It is a lot of golf left. Anything can happen. Yeah, just trying to stay as present as I possibly can and not take myself too seriously, at least in the beginning.
But all the way through just trying to stay calm and just play golf.
