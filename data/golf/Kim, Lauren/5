 Q.  From being here last year to this year and seeing how things play out here, how important is it, or not, to just kind of give yourself that sort of advantage right out of the gate maybe on the leaderboard and confidence-wise?  
LAUREN KIM: Yeah, I think it's really important. I mean, it's a marathon. It's a really long two weeks. It's an emotional two weeks too, because you're playing for next year.   
But it feels good to get a good round under par this first round, and hopefully can continue the play tomorrow.   
I am not getting ahead of myself. There are seven more rounds. You kind of have to pace yourself in the same respect.   
So I'm hitting the ball a lot better than I did last year, and hopefully that will kind of carry me through.
