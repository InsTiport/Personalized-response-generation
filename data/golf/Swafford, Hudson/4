 Q.  Nice final round for you.  Curious how much you were watching the scoreboard and if that changed anything you tried to do down the stretch?  
HUDSON SWAFFORD: I was pretty far back, to be honest with you.  I didn't really start seeing scoreboard until kind of back nine.  I made birdie on 11, and then 12 I almost made birdie; just kind of pulled it.  And then 13 I saw the scoreboard and knew that -- I saw that they were like 17, I don't know what I was, 17, 18; I was at 15.  Man, couple good shots and you have some chances.   
But I hit a couple poles.  Had a little bit of lefts.  Honestly, didn't feel bad.  Really felt solid.  Just a couple -- just a little left, but all in all pretty solid.   
 Q.  I was going to say, all in all, felt right this whole week, didn't it?  
HUDSON SWAFFORD: Yeah, it did.  It did.  Everything felt good.  It's good to be back competing and healthy again from last year.  New father, so life couldn't get much better.   
 Q.  What does this week mean to you for the rest of 2019 for you moving forward?  
HUDSON SWAFFORD: Yeah, it's a good jumpstart.  I love this place.  I've played well here in the past.  I've two previous Top 10s and an 11th I want to say.  Feel comfortable here.  Feels like a golf course in south Georgia with maybe a few more palm trees.   
So it's great.  Great to start the year like this.  Did some good stuff over the holidays with my coach and swing is feeling good.  Every thing is feeling good.
