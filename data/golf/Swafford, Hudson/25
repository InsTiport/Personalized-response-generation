 Q. You were the last player in the field this week.  How does it feel taking advantage of that today?HUDSON SWAFFORD: Feels great.  Can't thank Billy McGirt enough for letting me in.  No, I really saw it last week and just kind of building off of it.  Was just kind of anxious.  I was first-alt last Friday and I knew that, and I knew I was playing good, doing some good things and just wanted a chance.  I love this place. It's a great golf course, tough.  Can't get ahead of yourself or you can sort of make a couple bogeys quick.  Just gave myself a lot of chances.
Q. Were you in the area when you got word?HUDSON SWAFFORD: I was here.  I came here Sunday night actually.  I knew I was first-alt, and normally some guys withdraw early in the week, and especially being late in the summer.  I know it's a small field but I still thought I had a pretty good chance to get in. And come Wednesday, I was thinking, maybe it's not meant to be.  But like I said, can't thank Billy McGirt enough for pulling out.
Q. You said the course is playing tough.  Were there any certain holes that posed any real problems for you?HUDSON SWAFFORD: I made a couple bogeys out there, but such a demand on hitting fairways here and the rough is brutal in a lot of spots on par 4s.  Just have to hit fairways and you have to be patient.  There's a lot of pins and you can't go at them.  The pins are receptive but still a good test of golf, the wind picked up all morning. All in all, I thought I had a really good game plan, stuck to it and didn't really get outside of it.  Played solid.
