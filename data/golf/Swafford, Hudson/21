Q. Special day.  What was the difference in today and yesterday?
HUDSON SWAFFORD: The wind.  Not much.  I got off to a slow start yesterday.  Kind of made a mess of the first hole, a little brain dead that early in the morning.  But really played beautifully since the fourth hole yesterday.  Really good back nine.  Saw some really good golf shots.
Kind of came into today just thinking good rhythm.  Still windy, not quite as windy as it was yesterday morning obviously but I hit a lot of quality golf shots, hit a lot of fairways.  Really feel good on the greens.  It's good to be back on bermuda.  Really comfortable there.
Q. You're a southern guy, so these genes really suit you, don't you?
HUDSON SWAFFORD: Absolutely, yeah.  This is what I grew up on.  This is what I played -- well, I guess we were bent in Athens, but there was a lot of places that had bermuda.  Growing up, you live on bermuda.
Q. You're a big, tall guy and when you get to the tie, you have this cool, rubber band, whip motion.  Could you describe your swing?  You generate a lot of clubhead speed?
HUDSON SWAFFORD: Yeah, actually had a laid-off golf swing for a long time and working with Scott Hamilton has got me keeping it simple.  Just trying to go up the plane, down the plane, so he's got my right elbow a little lower and trying to get the club more down the plane.  It's pretty simple stuff.  Just got to do it.
I hit one or two poor putts coming in but overall through the two days, I've hit a lot of good ones.
