 Q.  Another solid day, 66 yesterday, 67 today. 4-under. Five birdies and a bogey. Your thoughts on how well you thought you played.  
HUDSON SWAFFORD: Playing solid. Just playing aggressive to conservative targets and giving myself a chance. I feel like I'm rolling it good. So you got to do that out here, as firm as the greens are, so it's tough to be even aggressive with a lob wedge on some holes. So, yeah, just staying patient and having fun.   
 Q.  How much different did the course play? You were out yesterday afternoon, had to come back this morning, was there any difference in green speeds or the way the course played?  
HUDSON SWAFFORD: The greens might have been a touch more receptive early, but obviously it was being cold, so the ball's not going very far. I was actually freezing and saw people in just jerseys out there and shorts and I couldn't believe it. But, no, it was a little colder, but the greens held a little bit more this morning than yesterday afternoon, for sure.   
 Q.  And you're on a major medical, played in Hawaii, played at the American Express. Confidence level, where are you in your game right now?  
HUDSON SWAFFORD: The game's good. I had one bad round in the desert, started off in Hawaii played great, didn't have my best weekend on a place that I love that I've had a lot of success. The game's good, just have to be patient. Every now and again for a little bit I was getting a little impatient and it showed. So just stay patient and kind of enjoy the walk.
