Q. Hi, Leona.  Nice to finish the way you did, playing the last seven in 1-under.  Birdieing the last must be pleasing.
LEONA MAGUIRE:   Yeah, it's really tough out there, a lot of woods into greens.  You start off the first hole and hit driver, 3-wood into the first green, and yeah, you just really have to pick your moments and play smart, really.  It was nice to finish strong.  The wind was really gusting on the back nine, swirling a lot, and it's probably playing 20, 25 yards into the wind on some of those holes.  So yeah, pars are like birdies out there on a few of them.
Q. It was obviously a tough run for you either side of the turn.  Can you talk about that stretch from 7 to 11?
LEONA MAGUIRE:   Yeah, tricky pin on 7, got the wrong side of the slope there and three-putted, and then 8 is 190 yards playing into the wind today.  Hit a 2-iron actually through the green there and just didn't get up-and-down, and a nice birdie on 9 and then hit it the only place you can't hit it on 10 down that slope.  And 11 is playing tricky, as well.  They're all tricky if you put it in the wrong spot.  It was nice to sort of steady myself there and finish off strong.
Q. Just looking at the scoring, it's not very hot at all.  2-under is leading, I think.  Obviously you're not that far away.  What are you looking forward to tomorrow?
LEONA MAGUIRE:   Yeah, I mean, I think -- well, if the wind stays like this, it's a case of not blowing yourself out after the first two days.  There's not a lot of chances out there, so you kind of have to take your pars where you get them, and with only two par-5, as well, and both those pins were tucked today.  Yeah, it's a case of taking your pars and just sort of being patient more so than anything else.
