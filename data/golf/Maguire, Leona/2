Q. (Recording in progress.)...and also a few nice saves.
LEONA MAGUIRE: Yeah, I mean, it was always going to be a tricky starting off on those first few holes.  I hit the bad shot into 2 and doubled a good bogey there.
Gave myself a good eagle chance then on 3, so that was a nice bounceback there.  I really took advantage of the par-5s today.  That's what I wanted to do today that I didn't do yesterday.
Eagle on 9 gave me a lot of momentum sort of heading into the back nine.  That loop is always tricky around 12, 13, 14, so had some really good pars there, and it was nice to get the two birdies to finish.
Q. That little run there, I mean, obviously after the bogey on 7, what are your thoughts?  (Indiscernible - wind.)...8, 9, and 10.
LEONA MAGUIRE: Yeah, it was.  It was nice.  I knew I really just had to stay patient.  I knew there would be chances.  I didn't hit a great shot into 7.  I kind of pulled it.  It was probably too much club anyway.
I mean, at that point, when I was in that heavy stuff, 4 was a good score for there.
Q. 9 you hit 5-wood?
LEONA MAGUIRE: 5-wood, yeah.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
LEONA MAGUIRE: It was like 230.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
LEONA MAGUIRE: It was a 9-iron into 10, and then a wedge into 17 and a 7-wood into (indiscernible.)
Q. And the par-3 obviously when you were in the heavy rough, that was...
LEONA MAGUIRE: Yeah, I mean, I pulled it.  I think the wind was coming out of the right that we didn't really feel back on the tee.  I didn't feel like I hit that bad a shot, but it kind of just caught quite a bit of momentum up there.
The par-3s are tricky around here.
Q. Saw you looking at the leaderboard here and there.
LEONA MAGUIRE: Yeah, wanted to give myself a chance going into tomorrow.  Same will be important tomorrow.  Hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.  I had quite a few chances on the front nine that I didn't hole.
Maybe hole a few more putts tomorrow.
Q. How far is too far back do you think?
LEONA MAGUIRE: I mean, it's hard to tell.  Obviously like to be as close as possible.  If you play well there are a lot of birdie chances out there.  You could go on a run like I did today and you could move up pretty quickly.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
LEONA MAGUIRE: I felt pretty calm.  I think it doesn't feel all that different really.  Just really playing my own game.  I think this course suits me well, which is nice to start on.
Yeah, just playing steady and solid and picking up birdies.
