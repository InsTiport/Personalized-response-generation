LEONA MAGUIRE: I've had a great week.  Would have liked to play a little bit better today, but yeah, the goal this week was to have as much fun as possible and play as well as I could, and I've done pretty much that.
Q. How much fun has it been taking on these professionals in this big major championship and featuring so strongly on this leaderboard?
LEONA MAGUIRE: It's been great.  I've had a lot of fun this week, and it's been great having my sister on the bag and enjoyed every minute of it.
Q. Some of the top amateurs here this week, what's your first impression of winning this trophy?
LEONA MAGUIRE: It's a huge honour.  I'm sure there are some great names on that that have been there before me.
So it's nice to join them, and like you said, all the top amateurs in the world are here this week and it's not often that we all get to play in the same tournament.  I think I showed that I can compete with the best of them and would liked to have had a little bit better finish today, but I'm very, very happy with the week.
Q. So this is your RICOH Women's British Open; is there anything you did differently this week to prepare yourself or anything you did out on course that you learnt from last time?
LEONA MAGUIRE: They were completely different, 2012 and Hoylake, it absolutely blew a gale, and it was a completely different golf course.
Coming into this week, I had played a lot of tree-lined courses back home in Ireland and I was expecting it to be a little bit tighter.  I played a lot of parkland golf leading up to this knowing it wasn't a links golf course.
I've played in a few major championships and I sort of know the feeling what it's going to be like on the first tee and playing in a little bit bigger group.  Every time you play in something like this, you learn a lot.
Q. Going back to the experience, you've played a bit of parkland; is there anything that this is going to help do you better next year, do you think?  What were the key learnings from this week?
LEONA MAGUIRE: Yeah, I think I definitely saw the pins get trickier and trickier as the week went on, and making sure you're in the right spots.  Today I wasn't in as many nice spots as I would have liked to have been.  That's a major championship setup.  Yeah, I suppose you see that more and more, the more of these you play.
Q. High point of the week for you?
LEONA MAGUIRE: Probably yesterday, I suppose.  That was a nice 69.  I played really, really nice yesterday to sort of jump up the leaderboard.  But overall, it's been a great week.
Q. So what's next for you?
LEONA MAGUIRE: Leave for Rio for the Olympics on the 11th of August, so really excited about that, can't wait to get out there.
Q. And any ideas of turning professional?
LEONA MAGUIRE: I think I'm going to go to Q-School,  LPGA Q-School, later on this year.  These events are good preparation for that.
