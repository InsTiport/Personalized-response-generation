 Q. Corey Pavin, first of all, what were the keys to playing well today for the round? 
 COREY PAVIN: I just hung in there. I actually probably didn't hit the ball as well as I've been hitting it. 
 I had some good up and downs, some key short putts, and I had a good finish coming in. I think I birdied four holes coming in that got me back up there. 

 Q. No player has every won all four "Texas Swing" events. Do you have that in your sights? 
 COREY PAVIN: I would love to do that. I've been trying to do that for a long time, and I don't know if I'm too old or not, but I'm tryin' hard, and it's a big golf course for me but I'm just trying to manage my game and play it the best I can and just see what happens the next couple of days and see where I end up.
