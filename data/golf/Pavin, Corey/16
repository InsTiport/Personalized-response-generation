 Q.   Did you have any idea the two‑stroke infraction had occurred?   
COREY PAVIN:   Not really.   I knew, when I grounded my club on that chip, I saw the ball.   I thought it oscillated and had come back to its position.   I didn't really think much of it.   When I finished, they said they wanted me to take a look.   I looked at it on the tape and looked at it in slow motion and looked at it a couple times, and it never oscillated back to its position.   It was very obvious.   
The rules say it's a two‑shot penalty, and that's the way it is.   
   
 Q.   How do you bounce back and adjust your mindset going into tomorrow?   You're still right in the championship.   
COREY PAVIN:   It doesn't change anything.   I played well today, managed my game well.   I putted nicely.   I thought I shot 5 under, but it was 3 under.   Still a very good score.   I just like the way I played.   That's the important thing now.   
There's three more rounds and lots of time to make it up and lots of golf left.  
   
 Q.   100 percent class you showed there.   Back to you.
