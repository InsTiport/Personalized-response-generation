  Q. Corey, I'm going to ask you the same question I started with Monty, what's the mood in your team room?  
 COREY PAVIN: It's good. We had a nice dinner last night and had a little chat and talked about things and come out here and try to turn it around.   
  
  Q. What sort of things were being said?  
 COREY PAVIN: I think basically we need to play better today than we did yesterday. The European Team played very well yesterday starting off. So we just have to turn around momentum, win a few holes and change that board a little bit.  
  
  Q. In that Europe were so rampant was the break in play a good thing for the American point of view?  
 COREY PAVIN: I don't think it was a bad thing for us. Things were obviously going the wrong direction for us and sometimes when you get a break like that, and it's kind of like what happened on Friday as well. Europe got off to a good start, rain came, sat around all day and we came back out and played better today. Hopefully history will repeat itself today.  
  
  Q. As a player, you've seen these situations, a pairing that is well behind, they say, well, we have to take some risks and get back in this thing quickly?  
 COREY PAVIN: That's the way match play works. If you're too far behind, you just have to go out there and be aggressive and if things happen, they can turn around and if they don't, you're going to lose. You just have to go out there and be aggressive and a couple of matches are just 1-down; one hole, two holes will change all that.  
  
  Q. What would you consider a decent result out of this section now then?   
 COREY PAVIN: Well, I just want to see the guys play well and turn some of these matches around. You know, I haven't really thought about it in that light. I would just like to see some momentum change and see some red up there, that's for sure.
