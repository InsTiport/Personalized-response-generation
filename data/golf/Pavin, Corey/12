  THE MODERATOR:   We d like to welcome Corey Pavin to the   Media Center.   Corey is the 1995 U.S. Open champion.   He posted a third round score today of 2 under, 6 under for the championship.   
Size up your round today for us, if you will.   
COREY PAVIN:   Well, it was kind of two rounds.   I played 1 through 13 very nicely, and I just misplayed a shot on 14.   I didn't think it was going to fly out of the rough and it did, cost me a bogey.   Then I miss aid short putt on 15 for birdie and scraped it around on 16 and 18 to make the par.   
So it was a tough finish, but I'm glad I made a couple putts coming in because 6 under is a whole lot better than 4 under.   
But I played well.   I know the guys were talking on TV yesterday that you have stretches at U.S. Opens that are tough, and I had that little tough stretch on the last five holes.   So hopefully, I can get rid of that tough stretch tomorrow and keep going and make some more birdies because Bernhard is going to be tough to catch tomorrow.   
THE MODERATOR:   Let's open it up to questions.  
   
 Q.   How do you think somebody makes nine birdies out there, having been out there yourself?   
COREY PAVIN:   I could give you the simple answer.   Hit the green in regulation and one‑putt nine times.   You know, Bernhard's that type of player.   There's a lot of guys out here that can do that.   
I guess he's missed four greens this week.   That's pretty amazing.   And he's a very precise player.   So he's going to hit a lot of very good iron shots, and he's going to have a lot of close birdie putts.   I imagine most of his putts for birdie today were from close range.   He's such a good iron player.   
And that's how you play well in the major championships.   He didn't win two Master's by luck, and whatever else he's won out here.   He's won a ton.   
So he's an exceptionally good player, very methodical.   And this type of a venue is a very good one for him.  
   
 Q.   The penalty, as soon as it was assessed, is that out of your mind, or does that linger two days later and you think, man, if that didn't happen I'd only be two shots out.   
COREY PAVIN:   Only because you're asking me about it.   No, I don't really think about it.   It's something that happened.   It happens in golf.   It was a rules infraction.   I should have been penalized.   They did the right thing.   As I said, I thank them for bringing it to my attention because it's important to protect the field in that regard.   
Obviously, I didn't know it happened.   So I was glad they brought it to my attention.  
   
 Q.   Being four strokes down, what does your mindset go through going into tomorrow's round?   
COREY PAVIN:   It's not really any different.   You can't really force a good score out here.   So I'm going to just go out here tomorrow and just try to hit greens and give myself opportunities at birdies, and hopefully I'll run the tables and make some putts.   
But you can't go up there and try to attack these pins.   If you miss it on the short side, you're going to make bogey.   So you've got to be careful.   You've got to pick your places to be aggressive.   I'm not going to go out there and do something silly trying to catch him.   
You never know how he's going to play tomorrow.   Bernhard will probably play well, but you never know.   You don't want to shoot yourself out of the tournament.   So I'll just go out there and keep doing what I've been doing.  
   
 Q.   Similar situation at Sahalee.   You a five‑shot lead, and then he goes out and shoots 67 the last day.   
COREY PAVIN:   And he won.  
   
 Q.   And he won.   It might sound like he's trying to sucker you guys in by saying come get me because I'm going to shoot under.   He's probably going to do it.   How much scoreboard watching do you have to tomorrow?   Can you afford to pick your spots?   Don't you have to go at every pin if you see him going, get a little bit of a hot start?   
COREY PAVIN:   It's not my style of golf to be really aggressive and go at pins.   I don't spin the ball a lot.   I don't hit it far enough to be real aggressive at some of these pins.   I've got to attack him on the ground, use the slopes, things like that.   
So it's hard for me to be‑‑ even if I am aggressive, it's really hard for me to get it close to the hole anyway.   So I've got to rely on making some 12, 15‑foot putts.   That's about as close as I'm going to get on some of these shots.   
Again, like I said, there's some pins you can attack, some holes you can attack, and I will.   You can count on that.   
I don't think I'll change my game plan really.   If it comes down near the end and I need to be aggressive, I will be then because I'll do whatever it takes to try to win the tournament coming down the stretch.   But I'm not going to shoot myself out of it in the first nine holes tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What about the scoreboard?   Are you going to watch that?   
COREY PAVIN:   Oh, yeah, absolutely.   I totally watch the scoreboard.   I knew everything that was going on out there today and all week.   I'm a huge scoreboard watcher.   I want to know exactly what position I'm in so I know what I need to do to get up there.   Sometimes who knows what's going to happen tomorrow.   I may have to be conservative, I hope.   
THE MODERATOR:   Corey, what's your routine now?   Will you go work some things out or go back and rest?   
COREY PAVIN:   I'm going to hit a few balls, hit a few putts.   There's a couple of things I want to work on.   I played fairly well today.   Just a couple of little minor things.   Just go back and rest.   
I've got a friend coming in tonight from out of town.   We'll hang out tonight and have dinner.   Try to sleep as late as I can tomorrow, stay up as late as I can tonight.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks a lot for coming in.   Good luck tomorrow.
