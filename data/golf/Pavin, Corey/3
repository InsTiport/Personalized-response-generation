 Q.  Did today's weather bring back any memories from seven years ago when you were here for The Ryder Cup?  
COREY PAVIN: I wasn't -- oh, seven years ago.  Because it was -- actually it was a different kind of wind.  I don't remember it being so windy seven years ago.  It was different.  It didn't seem as cold to me.  Today there was some cold -- when it started raining, it was really cold.  But when you're by the ocean -- is that an ocean?  Sea?  The wind, it's just a much windier day.   
 Q.  When you come back to Wales, what does it mean to you to be able to play here?  
COREY PAVIN: I don't really think of it that way actually.  I just like coming over and playing links golf in general.  But coming back to Wales, it does bring back memories of that whole experience.  For a couple of years, I came over here a few times for The Ryder Cup.  People are super nice and here they are incredibly nice.  When I think of Wales, more than anything the hospitality is fantastic.  It was such an honor to be The Ryder Cup captain.   
 Q.  You've been in good form, have you found something in your game this season?  
COREY PAVIN: Yeah, I went to see my teacher, did a lot of good work.  So my swing is better, and I was a little mentally off, so went and saw my sports psychologist.  Worked with him before Maryland, and that helped, as well.   
So I'm just trying to get back into the flow.  I think coming back from my injury, kind of took me a little bit longer than I thought it would to come back.  It's getting better.
