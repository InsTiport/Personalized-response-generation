COREY PAVIN:  I think everybody knows what's going on and what the options are, so there's not much to talk about.
Q.  You've got your own things to worry about obviously when you're out there, but were you watching the leaderboard?
COREY PAVIN:  Oh, I was watching for sure.
Q.  Did you like what you saw (playing with Stewart Cink).
COREY PAVIN:  Always like what I see with Stewart.  He's an excellent player and he's had Ryder Cup experience obviously.  If Tom asks me any questions tonight, I'll tell him what I saw out there and we'll talk about it.
Q.  Does he have the qualities of a player that you and Tom are looking to add to this team do you think?
COREY PAVIN:  You'll have to ask Tom that.  He makes those choices.  I'm there to support in any way he wants me to, so that's a question for Captain Tom.
Q.  Do you think he has the qualities that he might like for the team?
COREY PAVIN:  I hope so.  Again that's up to him.  You know, just have to wait and see what he's going to talk about tonight and where he's going to go, what he wants to do.
