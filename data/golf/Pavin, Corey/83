Q.   Talk about your round.  I know you got to 9 today and you were right there.  What did happen?
COREY PAVIN:  I played well today, no problems with what I did out there today.  I made a few bogeys coming in, but I really didn't feel like they were mistakes I made necessarily.  I hit some good shots that didn't turn out well, drew a bad lie on 17.  I was very satisfied with what I did today, and I was very pleased and very happy with birdieing 18, as well.
Q.   It's just sometimes one of those days when somebody else just plays a little bit better.
COREY PAVIN:  Yeah, I mean, nothing went great today, nothing went too bad.  It just didn't seem to come together today.  I was really pleased with the way I swung the club and the way I putted.  You know, it was just a day it didn't happen.
Q.   Was there any point in the day when you actually looked at the leaderboard and saw that you were on top at one point?
COREY PAVIN:  I think I was tied for the lead after 12, I believe, but I always want to know where I am.  I happen to bogey 13 but I hit three really good shots.  I hit my third shot and it was perfect but it went over the green, and I made bogey there.

You know, again, I was real pleased with what I did today, and I have no regrets at all about today.
Q.   Talk about this course.  It's one that doesn't necessarily favor longer hitters.  How does that set up for a guy like you?
COREY PAVIN:  I'd say it sets up favorably (laughter).  Courses where length is not a critical factor is a good course for me.  Courses that are longer are harder for me to compete on, but I can.  You know, it's not as easy, but I certainly can compete on them, as well.
