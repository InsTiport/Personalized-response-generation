Q.
You got on a stretch today where you really had it going?
COREY PAVIN:  I played good today.  It was probably the day I played the best, actually, and just didn't score as well as I did the first two days.
Q.  What allowed you to score more or better?
COREY PAVIN:  The first two days you mean?
Q.  You said you had the best day going today.
COREY PAVIN:  Well, I hit it better today.  I struck it better and got a couple putts in and just made a couple mistakes and hit a couple of shots I'd like back.
Q.  Do you know which shots you're talking about?
COREY PAVIN:  Well, I hit on 13, the par 3, I hit a 5 wood there a little weak in the reasoned bunker, and I'd like to have that one over.

My second shot on 14, I pulled my 3 wood on my second shot and hit it in the rough and it led to a bogey.  Those hurt when I was 3 under.

But I was in really good position, I was playing good, and I still played good coming in.  I'm not displeased with what I did.  I just wish I could have got the ball in the hole quicker.
Q.  What are your thoughts today, tomorrow?  Are you going to be going out actually on the course to take a look at some guys or watch TV?
COREY PAVIN:  I'll probably watch some TV and probably talk to Tom Lehman today.  I need to go practice and work on my game and see if I can come out tomorrow and have a really good score.  That would help me.  I'm still playing the tournament
Q.  Oh, definitely.  You're in great position here.
COREY PAVIN:  I can't spend my time walking around the course and seeing stuff, but I'm sure Tom will be looking at guys and he'll give me his opinion on what everybody is doing.  I'll be able to see a lot on TV and see what guys are up to.
