 Q. Third place this week, maybe talk about the day a little bit?
 COREY PAVIN: Yeah, you know, I played really well. Actually for once, played better than my score indicated. I just really couldn't get the putts in that I needed to get in, but I played really solid golf today. 
 You know, a couple good putts here and there, but I had a lot of opportunities that I let slip away. All in all, it was a very good week. 

 Q. And maybe just talk about where you're going to play next; you have a bunch of major coming up. 
 COREY PAVIN: Yeah, playing the Senior British and then the Senior U.S. Open, and PGA Championship and JELD-WEN is on my schedule now. I assume they will all stay that way, but there's a bunch of majors now in a row, and I like the way I'm playing. Going to try to win one of these things here pretty soon. I feel like I'm close but just got to get over that little hump.

 Q. Maybe talk overall about this event in general, first-year event and a lot of people out here?
 COREY PAVIN: It was really good. The crowds today were amazing, a lot of people out there, and MontrÃ©al just put on a great show. 
 Obviously you know, there's not a lot of golf played up here, competitive golf, and people really support it. There's been so many people that have said, "We are so glad to have you here," and it's showed with the reception and the setup, and the golf course is great. All really good stuff.
