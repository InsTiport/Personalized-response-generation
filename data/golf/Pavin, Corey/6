 Q.   An opening round of 69, tell us about that one.   
COREY PAVIN:   I actually got off to kind of a shaky start and kind of pulled it together.   Played okay.   I probably could drive the ball a little bit better but I kept in play and kept it in front of me, and that's what you have to do in links golf sometimes and made some nice putts today.  
   
 Q.   A lot of people coming into this championship saw the way this course is playing and thought, Corey Pavin; did you?   
COREY PAVIN:   Well, I didn't come here to finish second.   I'm trying to win whenever I come to a tournament.   But I did like the way it was playing, on Monday especially.   It was very fast.   Maybe not quite Muirfield fast, but it was firm and I liked it.   It rained a little bit last night but still played very nicely.   The ball is still running out and I can always use extra run on my drives.  
   
 Q.   15th, 9th and third in your Champions Tour starts, has something clicked in the game?  
COREY PAVIN:   I've been playing well for quite a while but the ball just got in the hole a little quicker the last few weeks.   The putting is a little better.   That obviously all helps but I've been playing well for quite a while now.
