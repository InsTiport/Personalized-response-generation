   SCOTT HEBERT: Birdie and a bogey.   
  
  Q. What did you hit into 2 and what did you have?  
 SCOTT HEBERT: 2, hit sand wedge in. I had 5-wood at 12 and hit it into the bunker, straightforward bunker shot.   
  
  Q. How much did playing two weeks ago at the U.S. Open help?  
 SCOTT HEBERT: Helped tremendously. That helps a lot. You're used to the speed and people being around and a little bit of noise. It made me a lot more comfortable.  
  
  Q. What are you going to work on for tomorrow?  
 SCOTT HEBERT: Just going to hit some putts. Keep doing what I'm doing, just doing the same stuff.  
  
  Q. Was there anything in particular that is working?  
 SCOTT HEBERT: I had good control over my distance and direction. I probably could have been a little bit more aggressive, knock out some of the flags early. But the way I look at these things I'm happy. It's tough out there.  
  
  Q. How much having played in the past help?  
 SCOTT HEBERT: It helps a lot. You get used to it and playing the practice rounds. I didn't freak out too much. I knew it was going to dry out. Like 9, when I got here, hit 3-iron, now just chipping 9 irons at it. So going to do nothing but get faster and firmer and it helps me because I'm straight and that makes my straight ball long.
