  Q. You held it out there together, what it you take from this? What did you do well?  
 SCOTT HEBERT: Well, I have to get more balls in the fairway. That back nine, that really killed me. The front nine was a little difficult getting going after that big, long delay, but you know, I had a few good chances early and missed them.   
 But then made a couple of loose bogeys and then got it back to even on the back and then just hit three loose shots and that's all it takes. It's such a fine line here.   
 I shouldn't have bogeyed 14. 15 is a par 5 for me. And you know, 16 is a bad bogey, as well.   
  
  Q. You and Pete Dye have become pretty good friends; how do you compare this to French Lick? Are they different courses completely?   
 SCOTT HEBERT: I think the Pete Dye might be tougher to be honest with you. You know, there's a lot more visual intimidation here, but as far as room to play, he gives you a little bit more room here. Greens are much larger, so you can hit a few more greens in regulation.   
 Plus, the atmosphere and everything that goes along with it. This place is harder for me, because it's the PGA Championship.  
  
  Q. How does this PGA Championship compare to others you've played in over the past few years?   
 SCOTT HEBERT: I like this course the best of Southern and Hazeltine and Oakland Hills. I think this is a fine golf course, nothing against those but it suits me better. I just didn't have my good stuff today.
