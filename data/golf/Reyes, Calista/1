Q. You're through another round; what was the key to doing well today?
CALISTA REYES: I think just like staying consistent with all my shots and definitely just not getting too excited with like forcing birdies or anything.  I just needed to hang in there because every shot that I hit Karah really matched my shots, so I just had to hang in there and take advantage of situations.
Q. Was it an easy win, tough win?
CALISTA REYES: I think it was a pretty tough win because even though I was up on some parts of the match, then she would always like come back and win another hole, and then we'd go back to pretty close.
Q. What do you have to do to keep moving through this tournament?
CALISTA REYES: I think I definitely need to just stay consistent as always and just play one shot at a time because I can't overthink it and think ahead because that will get the best of me at the end of the day.
