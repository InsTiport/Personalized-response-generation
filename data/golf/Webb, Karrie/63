Q.   Second place.   Probably not the result you wanted, but a great week nonetheless.   Just tell me about it. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah.   I shot 67 today, so I can't really complain.   I think Inbee shot 66.   She played really, really well.
Obviously you want to win, but just to be in contention and perform well under pressure, just to feel what it's like to be in contention, is good.
I gave myself the chance.

Q.   Tell me about that chip at 18.   Obviously you thought it was tracking.   You were getting ready for the fist pump.   Take me through 18 and what you were thinking. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Well, I didn't have a very comfortable carry out.   I had my 5â€‘wood.   I knew that Inbee had gotten 16, so I knew had to go for it and try and make there.
It was a bit of a hanging lie.   Hit an unbelievable chip, landed the way I wanted it to and reacted the way I wanted it.   It looked good there until it died right at the end.

Q.   Last one:   This week obviously this crowd, the way they treat everybody, take me through the week and how it felt to be here. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, I mean, this tournament treats everyone fantastically, especially if you're a past champion.   It's definitely a tournament to win, because you get treated with the utmost high quality, hospitality, and they celebrate their past champions.
So it's a wonderful event.
