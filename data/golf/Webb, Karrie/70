  Q. Tell me a little about your finish today and your tournament overall.   
 KARRIE WEBB: Well, a couple pars, so I didn't do any damage. I would have liked to have made one birdie, but happy with how things went this week.   
 You know, I left a bunch of shots out there, but I think anyone can say that at a U.S. Open. It's my best performance at a U.S. Open for quite some time. I'm happy with that.  
  
  Q. Did all the crazy schedule, the weather, looking back on the whole five days now, how do you think it affected you? Or did it?  
 KARRIE WEBB: Oh, I don't think it affected me any more than it affected anyone else. I just tried not to think about it.   
 I think if it was any other event besides the U.S. Open, you'd be whining and not happy about things, but you're at the U.S. Open and in contention, so that's all you can ask for.
