 Q.   5‑under 67 today, obviously a good moving day for you.   Four shots off the lead right now.   Just talk about the day and the position you've put yourself in.   
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, you know, I left myself a little bit of work after the first two days, but putted really nicely today, made the most of the opportunities I gave myself where I didn't do that the first two days.   Hopefully we'll only at the end of the day be only four shots off, and I have overcome larger deficits at this course before.   I'm just glad I gave myself a chance, and if we can get some breeze going tomorrow, I think that'll make it interesting.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel any more‑‑ got any more Sunday heroics in your bag here at Mission Hills?  
KARRIE WEBB:   I hope I haven't used them all.   It's been seven years since I used it, so hopefully I've got some left.  
   
 Q.   Just talk about tomorrow.   What's your mentality in terms of obviously you're going to be four or five shots back.   Are you going to have to go after it or sort of figure it out in the first few holes?  
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, I think it'll depend on the conditions.   If they're pretty benign, not too much breeze, I think I'm going to have a shoot a pretty low one because there's a lot of great players in there with a chance.   We'll just see.   I knew I needed to finish at 5 or 6 once I made the turn, and happy that I did that.
