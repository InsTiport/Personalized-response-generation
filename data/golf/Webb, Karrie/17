Q. Best round of the tournament so far, what was working for you out there today?
KARRIE WEBB: Well, I hit the ball pretty nicely all the week, especially over the weekend.  Yesterday, all week, I haven't made any putts, and today I made some putts and that was nice to finally see.
Q. How does that happen?
KARRIE WEBB: I don't know, I started making three or four in a row and I looked at Johnny and I'm like, what's going on, I don't understand why they are going in the hole all of a sudden.
Q. Nice way to end the tournament, isn't it?
KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, it's been a long three-week stretch for me.  So to finish on a good note is a nice positive, and I'm looking forward to the West Coast Swing in the States.
Q. Do you enjoy playing in the States?
KARRIE WEBB: I do. I've played the majority of my career there and it will be nice to get there.  I've typically played well on the West Coast.
Q. With 21 years on Tour, how do you keep it fresh?  How do you keep going?
KARRIE WEBB: It's a tough question.  I think sometimes the grind of the travel and the different hotels and stuff, it gets a little weary.
But I think this year, I've got a different caddie for the first time in 15 years, so we have different things to talk about.  So I think that makes it a little fresh.
I'm eyeing the Olympics in August, so that's kept me really motivated for probably the last four or five years.
