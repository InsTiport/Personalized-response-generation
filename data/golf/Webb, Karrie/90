  Q. Yesterday you said you might be too far away to make a challenge, and today, you're right in there.   
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, I knew I needed to get it at least to even today and I'm hoping that's good enough. The wind has not stayed as strong as it was, so I'll be happy to get it into a playoff I think.  
  
  Q. What do you do now?   
 KARRIE WEBB: Just hang around, have a bite to eat and just see what happens.   
  
  Q. What was the story of the round today?  
 KARRIE WEBB: I played pretty well. I made a couple of really key par putts, but I didn't have much going on until the birdie and the 20-yard chip shot for eagle.   
 I knew I had to birdie the four last holes to get to even. I think even could be in a playoff but I think it would be lucky.   
 When I was walking up 18 -- I've continually been working on my putting and it's been coming around. I felt really comfortable on the greens this week.  
  
  Q. Tell us about the burglary in your hotel room the other day.   
 You know, once I got on the range I tried to switch it off because there was nothing I could do about it for the next five hours. I think I did a good job. Obviously I'm pleased with my last three rounds to get back to even.  
 I had a good week last week. I always love playing the British Open, so having a good week last week gave me a lot of confidence this week.   
 6, I hit I my 22-degree rescue and 2-putted from 40 feet.   
 15, I went for the green in two with 3-wood and just hit it short left and obviously hit a good shot but got lucky that it went in the hole.   
 Then 16, I hit a wedge to a 6 feet.
