   KARRIE WEBB: Probably the worst I could have turned. I had a lot of opportunities on the front nine that I didn't take advantage of. I didn't have easy putts, but, yeah, it would have been nice to make a couple more.  
 I missed a few greens on the back nine, so it was a bit of a struggle. You know, a little disappointed with shooting 2-over with the way I started today.  
 But, you know, I'm still not out of it, and I have a lot of golf to go.  
  
  Q. Do you like where you're standing right now?  
 KARRIE WEBB: I would have liked to have been a couple shots better. But, you know, it's not out of it. You know, I didn't shoot myself in the foot too much.   
 I've still got -- I mean, it's gonna be a long weekend, so, you know, it's hard to tell what's gonna win. I've just gotta keep going out there and shooting as well as I can.  
  
  Q. How much does experience take over when you get to the final, you know, on the weekend, the final two rounds, and those who have been here handling the pressure, does experience count for a lot?  
 KARRIE WEBB: I think it does sometimes if you listen to the voice of experience. I think sometimes you can be a rookie in many ways, because, you know, you start pressing when you don't need to. I've done that many times at the U.S. Open.  
 I've handled it well at the U.S. Open. So, you know, I've just got to keep my calm and, you know, keep giving myself the opportunities, and hopefully the putts will drop.
