Q. Not a great start.  Was it one thing or a number of things?KARRIE WEBB: It just wasn't a very good day.  I drove the ball quite bad, so that's pretty much the start and end of it right there.Q. Was there any specific thing or the driver just not working for you?KARRIE WEBB: I missed a lot of fairways.  So once you are out of position, you can't do much with that.Q. What do you see for Sunday?  What's the best case approach in this case?KARRIE WEBB: Just go out and play and try my hardest and post whatever numbers I'm going to shoot.  I don't think I have a chance to win anymore
