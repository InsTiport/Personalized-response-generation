 Q.  You must be glad to be in in some ways.  It was an excellent round for you out there.  You must be very happy with your day's work?  
KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, very lucky to get in.  It's actually stopped raining but yeah, very happy with 2-under.  That back nine was definitely a struggle once it started raining.   
 Q.  The winds are really strong on your front nine but you got off to a great start, didn't you, a couple birdies early on?  
KARRIE WEBB: I did, yeah.  I felt very comfortable out there early on and got off to a good start, so that settled any nerves that there was.  Really just hung in there on the back nine.  I actually got a couple of good breaks when it was raining.  Made some good up-and-downs, as well.   
 Q.  That rain when it came in, it must have been very hard to keep it together.  
KARRIE WEBB: It was.  Especially on 18, it literally was just coming sideways.  It was nice the tee was up today, so that made that hole a little less challenging.  Sei Young hit two amazing shots in there to have an eagle putt.   
But yeah, happy to be done and happy to be in the position I am.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to tomorrow, not a lot has changed at the top of the leaderboard.  It's almost off you go again, isn't it.  
KARRIE WEBB: Well, if we are in threesomes, it will be the same group tomorrow.  We all enjoyed each other's company today.  Our golf inspired each other, and hopefully it's the same tomorrow.
