conditions today?
 KARRIE WEBB: I'd like to think it wasn't as windy as they thought it was going to be this afternoon. The wind was full out, but it laid down a little bit from when we first teed off, so it makes the scoring a little bit better and the greens when it wasn't as windy didn't dry out as much as they would have.

 Q. The course seems to be playing pretty well for you. You had five birdies and one bogey. Yesterday we watched you in the Pro-Am, and on your last shot you knocked it within a couple feet of the pin. Is there something about this course you like?
 KARRIE WEBB: I have played pretty well here in the past. I just enjoy playing in Florida. I play a lot of golf in Florida because I live here and it's similar to where I grew up, as well. And I enjoy playing in the wind, too; it makes you a little bit more creative.

 Q. So same plan for tomorrow?
 KARRIE WEBB: Hopefully, yeah.
