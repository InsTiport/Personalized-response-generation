  KARRIE WEBB:   I mean, one of the greatest athletes, female athletes of all time, and Inbee's in the same bracket as that.   
   
 Q.   You were in that position of being the top player of the year.   You know how tough is it to win one, but I mean, three in a year, I guess, what is the sense there?   
KARRIE WEBB:   I think I have a heartbeat.   I don't know.   I don't know if Inbee has one.  
   
 Q.   What about the fact that she's at 10â€‘under on this course?   
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, well, I didn't see that.   You can obviously feel for someone like I.K. Kim who would be winning any other U.S. Open on this golf course if it weren't for Inbee.   So, you know, she's played great too.   Sometimes it's just not good enough when someone is as hot as Inbee is.
