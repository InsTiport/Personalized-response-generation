 Q. Do you feel like you'll take that?KARRIE WEBB: I'll take it, because I didn't hit my irons very good today.  I really scrambled quite well.  To shoot even par, I'm pretty happy with that. I think the course, obviously there were some low scores out there today.  I think the course was set up to do that if you played well.  And I was happy to still have a chance tomorrow.  Michelle Wie has put a few of us back into the tournament.
Q. She's at 3-under and Amy is at 3-under.  You said yesterday you were six or seven off, you feel like it's a U.S. Open, you still feel like you can take it right now?KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, I think I'll probably need an under par round of some sort tomorrow.  But, you know, obviously about an hour and a half, two hours ago I didn't think I had a shot, I'm pretty happy about that.
Q. You think tomorrow you're apt to see a tougher setup, do you think tomorrow is going to be a --KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, I think it will still be fair, though.  I think it will be a fair set up.  I don't think they're going to do anything crazy. They might move the tee back on 10 again, so that's not reachable. And they moved the tee back on 12 today, which meant a good par-4. It will depend.  They'll move the tees around.  And I'm sure we'll see pretty similar pins to what the guys had last week.
Q. Juli is 4-under today.KARRIE WEBB: It's great to see.  You know, she's said it's her last U.S. Open, but I bet if she qualifies for next year's U.S. Open she'll be back.
