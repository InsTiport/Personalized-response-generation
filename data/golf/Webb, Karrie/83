 Q. Talk about the finish on the 18th?
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, it is, whenever you finish with a birdie it's a nice way to finish, but 18 is always a tricky hole so I'll definitely take a three.

 Q. And it's not the only tricky hole out there, you've been talking about how you were using a 4-iron on many occasions and half the players out here don't have 4-irons. 
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, that's true. I don't think we've ever played this course with that much wind, and it's set in a little bit different direction than what we are used to; so a lot of long par 4s played really long today.

 Q. Your game is coming together, you played quite a bit in Australia where you said you were knocking off the rust, a good finish last week in Thailand, are you feeling comfortable?
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, last week was really good for my confidence. My ball-striking got a lot better and hopefully I can carry it into this week. Today was pretty solid.

 Q. Maybe talk us through the birdie there on the last?
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, just 3-wood off the tee, little 8-iron to probably ten feet.

 Q. Set you up well for tomorrow?
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, feels good. I birdied 16 and 18 and had a chance on 17, but you know, I finished two-out-of-three to finish 2-under and 2-under is a good score today, so I'm happy with that.

 Q. You mentioned knocking off the rust, three Top-10s in a row, time to take the next step I guess?
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, hopefully, just put myself there with a chance on Sunday and we'll see how things go from there.
