  KARRIE WEBB: The crowds have been fantastic.Q. So you would want to play here again?KARRIE WEBB: I would love to, yeah, for sure.Q. Do you think it's inevitable they'll make their way back here?KARRIE WEBB: I don't know.  I would like to see if the USGA thought it was a good Open venue.  I think all the players loved the golf course and just the support of the town.Q. Could you pick out one particular thing?  Is it the greens, the conditions, things like that?  It's an uphill climb, a physical, demanding course, but anything that really set it apart?KARRIE WEBB: To me it's just visually stunning.  Just about every tee shot is right out there in front of you.  It's an old traditional style golf course and that's what I love to see.  We need to play on more courses like this one.Q. Did the crowds behave?KARRIE WEBB: I thought the crowds were fantastic, yeah, right from Monday to today.  I thought the crowds were fantastic.  It's not often we get to play in front of that many people.  I finished two hours ahead of the leaders and the stands are full on 18.  It's really nice to walk up 18 with that many people
