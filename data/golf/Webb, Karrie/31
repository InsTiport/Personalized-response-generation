 Q.   Solid today, just one bogey.   
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, it was really solid.   Probably my most solid round of the year from start to finish.   I played really nicely all around, and had good momentum.   You know, made a few putts, which was nice.  
   
 Q.   I spoke to you in Australia a few weeks ago, you said you think you're being patient, but you want things to happen really early in your season.   Seems like this year is kicking off to a pretty good one.   
KARRIE WEBB:   I've had a pretty good solid couple of weeks leading into here.   Just not had a good first round and sort of puts you on the back of the foot to start the week.   
But it's nice to get off to a good start today, and hopefully next three rounds are similar and I have a chance again on Sunday.  
   
 Q.   You're from northern Queensland; the heat doesn't really brother you, and you live in Florida, as well.   
KARRIE WEBB:   I don't know if it doesn't bother me.   I don't think you ever get used to it.   But I prefer sweating than being wrapped up and have plenty of layers of clothes on because it's cold.  
   
 Q.   Is this a course that really suits you?   You played really well here last year, as well.  
KARRIE WEBB:   I wouldn't have told you that the first year we came here.   I don't think I really liked the course.   I don't know if I had a game plan that I felt comfortable with.   
But last year, I think we stuck to our game plan, and there's just certain holes you've got to hit it where the hole dictates and you've got to hit a good long iron into to the green.   There's nothing much you can do about it.   
So I think being comfortable with that game plan and then just going ahead and trusting things, I think that made me feel comfortable again coming in here this week.
