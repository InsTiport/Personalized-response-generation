 Q.  8-under round today; what was the key to the strong play?  
KARRIE WEBB: Well, early on it was so-called -- I really wasn't feeling it.  I made some good pars on the first few holes, and then I started to hit some better iron shots and made some putts.  On the back nine, everything went in, which I haven't seen much this year, so it was good to see.  It was fun.   
 Q.  During the three-week break, is there anything you worked on in your game that led to this?  
KARRIE WEBB: Not really.  I took a little bit of time off.  My parents are over, so maybe that was it, just coming back out fresh.  I went into the break having a good finish at the British Open, so it was a pretty laid-back three weeks.  I did do some practice, but it wasn't anything specific.   
 Q.  How important is that?  It was such a long stretch going there, and then you get three weeks off.  How much more rejuvenated are you going towards the end of the season?  
KARRIE WEBB: Well, it's nice to have two good finishes.  It's nice to see some of the hard work paying off, and I've worked really hard on my putting.  When they all start going in, I don't mind that at all.
