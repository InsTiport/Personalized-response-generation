Q.   Obviously not the final stretch you wanted but talk about the final holes. 
KARRIE WEBB:   I'm a bit in my head right now.   There's a lot going on.   Just not a lot of good decisions.   I mean, bad swing on 15 but‑‑ just bad decisions. 
I shouldn't have probably hit 3‑wood off 16 just because I missed with that club for some reason this week.   I've had that club in my bag for ten years and it's going left, so might need to look at a different 3‑wood I think.   Just shouldn't have hit 3‑wood off there but I made a good par. 
We got put on the clock on 17, which doesn't help when your mind's already gone pretty quickly.   With the wind into us on 18, I just should never have hit driver off that tee.   I had said to Mickey, if I can't reach a 5‑wood, there's no point in going, and I don't think I could have hit it far enough down there in that situation.   So I'm not sure why I let Mickey talk me into hitting driver there.   I should have just laid up off the tee and given myself a wedge in, but I didn't do that and so not a lot of good decisions.

Q.   Difficult to ask questions, but do you not trust your instinct?   What happens to you in a situation like this, if you have one bad hole, do you feel that there's indecision going on in your mind and does it snowball a little bit; what happens? 
KARRIE WEBB:   If you're a sports psychologist, you make a lot of money doing that. 
I hit a great drive down 18 yesterday from the front tee, and part of me felt like I could do that, and if had pulled it off, it wouldn t have even   but my gut feeling was just to lay up off the tee. 

Q.   And the 3‑wood, the same thing, you were saying on 16, you shouldn't have played it, again‑‑
KARRIE WEBB:   I don't know what club I would have hit but it's‑‑ I don't know why it's all of a sudden misbehaving.   Something I need to look at. 

Q.   I don't want to bring age into it but it is there; is it harder to lose these things at 39 than it would be at 29?
KARRIE WEBB:   It's bad whatever age you're at.   I don't think it has anything to do with it. 
And if you're insinuating that that could be the last time that I have a chance to be in‑‑

Q.   I'm not doing that at all, no, not at all, please, I'm not doing that at all.   I meant no disrespect.   I'm just asking questions, that's all.   I'm only asking because‑‑
KARRIE WEBB:   Two weeks ago I handled the pressure well and made very good decisions coming down the stretch and I made all the putts I needed to make.   It just sometimes just go your way.   Doesn't feel great at the moment.   There's lessons to be learned from the decisions made. 
Even if you learn those lessons, sometimes you're going to repeat in that situation.   I've doubled the last to lose a tournament to SeRiPak before.   You know, it's happened to me before.   It's not the first time. 

Q.   I'm just intrigued by the mental game because I read your journal and you were talking about being in the zone in Australia which is interesting because that in itself is very rare and that's a fantastic feeling and this is different‑‑ just trying to understand what happens‑‑
KARRIE WEBB:   You're probably asking me a little too soon.   Why don't you read my blog next week when I've had a little time to have some perspective.
