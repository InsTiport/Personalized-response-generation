 Q.  Tougher day on the back nine than the front nine.  What was it like?  
KARRIE WEBB: It was a very tough day.  The wind switched from -- not sure where, but it switched to the complete opposite there, someplace on the back nine, on the 11th hole, and yeah, it picked up.  It was probably only a steady ten to 12 on the front nine, which made it challenging enough and then the back nine we were coming back into, so we were playing most of the holes into the wind.  It was quite a challenge.   
 Q.  Did it feel better than a minus one, just given the conditions?  
KARRIE WEBB: Well, I shot minus two yesterday and I didn't feel like I played that great because we played in the morning with no wind.  1-under is five shots better than the 2-under I shot yesterday.   
 Q.  Being an invite to the event, what does that mean to you?  
KARRIE WEBB: I hope it means that I was deserving of the invite.  I just wanted to play.  I love playing links golf and the challenge that it presents every day.  So I was glad that the tournament offered me the invite.   
 Q.  What do you have to do when the conditions are this way on a link course?  
KARRIE WEBB: Not get too far ahead of yourself and just -- I love it because it takes me away from being technical because you just can't be.  You've got to just be very creative and play a bunch of different shots that you're not used to but just trust in your ability that you can do it because it's not like you rehearse those shots on the range.  It's great for me to be like that.
