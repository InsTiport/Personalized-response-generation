   KARRIE WEBB:  Yesterday, and I just -- and didn't have a good feel out there.  And I had a lot of (indiscernible) definitely had a lot (indiscernible).  And I just didn't have a good feel for the (indiscernible) shot.   
  
  Q.  (Off microphone)   
KARRIE WEBB: (Indiscernible)   
  
  Q.  Rushing a bit?   
 KARRIE WEBB:  I was rushing to get that one out of there and really --   
  
  Q.  What are you going to work on, on the range?   
 KARRIE WEBB:  A bit of everything.  I haven't putted that well either.  (Indiscernible) I'm driving the ball all right on the fairways, but fine tuning a few things.   
  
  Q.  (Off microphone)   
 KARRIE WEBB:  Yes.  I'd be surprised, much more at the end of the day.  I don't think it will maybe 5, 6.  I'll be surprised at 5, 6 at the end of the day.  So 7 shots behind 4th.  But I had a great weekend.   
  
  Q.  What about these greens?  Perfect day.  What's so tough out there?   
 KARRIE WEBB:  Well, I just didn't leave myself good shots on the green today.  And, again, they're very fun and not that fast.  If you land them on the right spot, it's very controllable.  But just trying to get them out of the rough.   
  
  Q.  There are a lot of (indiscernible).  I imagine it's firmer than even yesterday given the wind?   
 KARRIE WEBB:  It's there, but I don't think it's much different.
