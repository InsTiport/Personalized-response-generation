 Q.  What were your thoughts on your second playing of the UL International Crown?  
KARRIE WEBB: Well, we had a lot of fun.  I had a lot of fun playing with Su and then Rebecca the last two days.  It's disappointing not to play the final day this afternoon.  I think I felt like the teams that we played, we played well enough, we just didn't make enough putts, and when it comes down to this format, that's what you've got to do.   
 Q.  Finally, just the overall experience of the weekend getting to play with three fellow countrywomen?  
KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, I mean, we don't get to do it, so it's fun and it's great to wear our Australian colors and just be around a group of Aussies for the week.
