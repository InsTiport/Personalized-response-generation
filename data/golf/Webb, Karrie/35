Q.   So model of the putter, the new one?   Or old new one. 
KARRIE WEBB:   It doesn't have a name because it was a prototype when they gave it to me.   I looked at it and I'm like, It doesn't have a name.   It just has Titleist on it.   It was a prototype when I got it, so...

Q.   And now it's working. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah.

Q.   Coach's name now?
KARRIE WEBB:   Mike McGetrick. 

Q.   Let's talk about finish.   Felt a little better on the back. 
KARRIE WEBB:   It was just a bit of an up‑and‑down day.   Didn't have as good a feel with my swing today.   It was a little bit inconsistent.
But finished with two birdies on the last three, so sort of makes dinner taste better.

Q.   Conditions got a little windier toward the end. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, cold and windy, and we also got timed, so it was nice combination.

Q.   Okay.   Seeing Hyo Joo's score yesterday any indication of maybe what could be out there for the rest of the weekend? 
KARRIE WEBB:   No, I don't see 61 out there.

Q.   For the rest of the week?
KARRIE WEBB:   I don't see it ever.   (Laughing.) 

Q.   No one has. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah.   And today, like I said yesterday, the pins were about as easy‑‑ I counted.   We went through yesterday and there were four tough pin positions yesterday.
Today, well, we had played 10 holes and they had probably five of the hardest pin positions you could have on the green.   So there was probably seven or eight tough pin positions today.   Scores probably reflect how much harder the course played today.

Q.   Does that help going into the weekend, knowing it can't get much harder?
KARRIE WEBB:   Oh, no, there is still some left.   Those pin positions are more indicative of the trickiness of the greens if you don't get in the right position.
