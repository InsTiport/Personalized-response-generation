 Q. Talk about how you feel about your performance today. 
 KARRIE WEBB: I'm a little disappointed. The conditions were tough, but you know, I had a pretty poor back nine which I'm a little disappointed about and puts me six shots back. So, I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

 Q. What's your focus going into tomorrow?
 KARRIE WEBB: I guess I can play aggressively now. I'm six shots behind, so just going to go for it and see what happens.

 Q. What do you think you have to do to put pressure on Sophie tomorrow?
 KARRIE WEBB: Get off to a good start, get a few under early and see how it goes. I think we are supposed to have pretty similar conditions tomorrow as far as the wind goes. I need to have a low one, so see what happens. 

 Q. More difficult conditions on the back nine today?
 KARRIE WEBB: The wind picked up as the day went on on the back nine. 

 Q. How was she playing out today?
 KARRIE WEBB: She played very well, real solidly. Only one or two missed shots and drove the ball really well and kept it in play.

 Q. Is there a number that you think you have to shoot to give yourself a chance tomorrow?
 KARRIE WEBB: It's going to have to be in the 60s of some sort.
