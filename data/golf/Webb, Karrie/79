  KARRIE WEBB: Just come off bogey on 10 and I put a really good swing on a 4-iron into 11 and made probably a 10-, 12-footer there. And then I rolled off another three birdies after that. But making that birdie, it was a two-shot swing, so I was only one shot behind after that. 

 Q. Do you feel like you called on all of your years of experience with Arimura on the back nine and Tseng making quite a run on the front nine?
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah, I really had to stay patient today. I didn't swing it very consistently. When I did swing it well, I took advantage and made some birdies but I really had to buckle down and try and get up-and-down on the holes that I missed greens. I'm just glad I finished one shot ahead.

 Q. Were you worried that Arimura had a chance to put you back for birdie?
 KARRIE WEBB: 18, and that pin position, it's a tough hole. I was glad to be on safely in two, and the fact that I got first putt and hit such a good first putt, I knew it was going to be tough to make that one but I was expecting it to go in for me it was nice that I could just tap that one in for the win.
