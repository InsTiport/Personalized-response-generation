 Q.   You're a multiple winner of this championship and I'm sure you've seen plenty of difficult conditions.   How easy was it today compared to what we were expecting?   
KARRIE WEBB:   I don't think you can ever say going around this golf course that conditions are easy, but they were definitely a lot more friendly than I think we expected.   Definitely probably the nicest day of the week so far.   I don't know if it's meant to play like that this afternoon or not, but I'm glad to get in.   
   
 Q.   How much does experience count in a tournament like this?   
KARRIE WEBB:   I think it counts for a little bit.   But you've still got to go out there and hit the shot, and you've got to commit to the lines that you want to hit your shots on, and do it, because there's really no‑‑ I think that there's a lot of links courses that there's a side to miss on, and I don't think this course, especially off the tee, there's a side to miss on.   You've just got to get up there and hit a good shot.  
   
 Q.   Is there one part of your game that was helping you get around today, one part that wasn't?   How were you doing it?   
KARRIE WEBB:   Everything was pretty good but my ball‑striking was pretty good today, especially early on, which really set the tone for my round.   Hit a lot of greens early on which made me a lot more comfortable on the course.  
   
 Q.   How key is that in the tournament?  
KARRIE WEBB:   I think that's huge this week, trying to keep it out of trouble, and you know, not get in too many of the bunkers or the long gorse or anything like that.   I did a good job of it today, and I have three more days to do it.
