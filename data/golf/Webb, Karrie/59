  THE MODERATOR:   Great finish.   How long was that putt? 
KARRIE WEBB:   It was probably 40 feet, I'd say. 
THE MODERATOR:   Talk about the back‑to‑back bogeys, followed up with a birdie. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, with the start, I had a really good front nine.   Yeah, it was just not that even bad of a swing into 11.   I thought I hit a good chip, didn't make the putt.   Hit a poor wedge shot into 12, then hit a poor chip. 
It was really bad timing in the round, sort of lost a little momentum there.   Made a birdie back on 13, so that sort of settled me down. 
THE MODERATOR:   It was a long rain delay.   How did you pass that time and get back out there? 
KARRIE WEBB:   Just the same as the other day.   Just sitting around, chatting. 
Yeah, I think our officials made a great call.   They sent us back out there and it was still raining.   We were wondering what they were doing, but I think we're going to get done. 
THE MODERATOR:   Heading into tomorrow, good position.   How do you feel? 
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, I feel great about it.   The putt on the last gets me that little bit closer.   Then again, it will depend on where Na Yeon finishes. 
But, you know, I think anyone four or five shots back has a shot tomorrow. 
THE MODERATOR:   How are the greens?   A little dark, playing under the lights. 
KARRIE WEBB:   They are slow.   But for how much rain we've had, not as slow as you would think.   They've done a good job. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Every day there is somebody that shoots 6‑under.   Do you think that's going to be enough tomorrow?
KARRIE WEBB:   That's why I don't really set a score.   You shoot 6‑under, if that's what you set, that's a great round, but it might not be enough. 
I don't mentally set a score.   I just go out, try to shoot as low as I can.   Hopefully that's enough. 
I don't know if I'll be in the last group or not.   If I am, at least I'll know how Na Yeon is playing.
