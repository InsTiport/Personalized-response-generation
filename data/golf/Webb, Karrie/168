KARRIE WEBB:  The first hole I missed the fairway right and laid up and hit a sand wedge to probably about 12 feet.  Five, I missed the green with a seven iron in the left green side bunker and missed about a 6-foot putt.  Six, I hit a 4-iron to 18 feet.  Eight, I hit a 5-iron to 20 feet.  11, I hit sand wedge to about a foot.  14, I hit a three iron on the green to about 20 feet and 3-putted.


Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  Yeah, I am.  The only difference from the first day to these last two days is I really haven't got into any trouble and I've hit a lot of greens.  I'm just managing my game very well.  I don't feel like I'm right at the top of my game, but I'm just managing the swings and avoiding really bad misses.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  It's hard to say.  I don't really use those as an excuse.  I think if I hadn't have bogeyed the last three holes coming in on Thursday, 1-under would have been a decent score.  And I would have taken that.  And it wasn't, I don't really feel like it was tiredness that I made those three bogeys, just some poor swings coming in.  I 3-putted the 17th.  So like I said, that's just the difference from that day to the last two.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  I just love the setup.  It's not, compared to today, these last two days aren't playing nearly as hard as it did on Thursday.  But I like that sort of golf.  And I don't think I could play it every week, because I think my patience level would just, the courses would outdo me if I had to play on courses like that every week.  It's a lot of fun.  You have to be very creative and you got to take the good bounces with the bad bounces.  And it's just cut out of the trees.  You can tell how all the golf course is when you're playing it.  It's very penal for bad shots.  But there's not out of bounds, not a lot of out of bounds.  I don't even want to start to think where, if there is out of bounds, where it is.  But there's no penalties, like hazards.  There's a few, but most of it is just, the penalty is trying to get it back on to the fairway because you're in the heather and the long grass.  So those sort of scores can sneak up on you.  Whereas, when you are faced with a big water hazard or a big white out of bounds stakes down one fairway, sometimes it's easier to avoid than when the stuff just sneaks up on you.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  Yeah, I think so.  I think that any player that's here this week can win this golf tournament.  In the top five probably there is no Americans, but there's a few in the top 20. And I think that this sort of golf is not golf that any American has grown up on, unless they lived in Europe for awhile.  I know that there's a lot of Americans that love coming over here too and playing this sort of golf.  And just like me, don't think I could play courses like this every week, but it's nice for a change.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  Oh, definitely.  I think that every week on the LPGA Tour you see strength from all countries around the world. The Europeans have been doing well.  And it doesn't surprise me to see them, Catriona Matthews is having a great year, so it doesn't  surprise me to see her at the top of the leaderboard.  She's had success all around the world and she's played very well in the States this year.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  To me, not really personally.  I've always crossed the British Open as a very important tournament to me anyway.  So the fact now that it's called a major, it's officially named a major, I think it's well deserved.  To me it doesn't really feel that much different.  Just maybe just a little more at stake if you're to win the tournament.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  I have, but I've also hit my long putts pretty decently and not had to struggle getting down in two when I've been a long way from the hole.  But I've had some shortish putts that I haven't made.  But I think I've also made a couple of 20-footers today that I feel like, I don't know, I don't like to think that -- every one can pick out a few, two or three shots that they could be better every day, so I don't like to sit down and think about those.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  I really didn't live anywhere.  I just lived out of my suitcase.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  A house in London here.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

KARRIE WEBB:  Thank you.
