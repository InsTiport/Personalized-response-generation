Q.   Good round, but overall probably not what you had hoped for this week.   Just tell us about the week. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Yeah, it was a pretty frustrating week.   I didn't really get anything going. 
I had a bad first seven holes on Thursday and recovered well after that, but then just the last few rounds never really got anything going, but it's good to (indiscernible) today and finish in the red numbers for the tournament.

Q.   Just coming back as the defending champion, is there more pressure?   Does it feel different?   Does it kind of mess with your week?
KARRIE WEBB:   I don't think so.   I mean obviously I had extra commitments this week, but you expect that, but you know, I felt ready.   I felt like I had a solid week last week, and just never carried over into this week.
I probably didn't have the comfort on the greens that I did last year and that was probably the key to me winning last year is that I made a lot of putts and felt like I could make more.   This week I just didn't feel like that at all.
