 Q. Can you tell me about your round today? 
 KARRIE WEBB: Pretty solid. I was a little tight to start with. I feel good about how I got through that, but I three-putted the first for bogey and birdied the second, so it settled me down a little bit. 
 But probably played the first six or seven holes a little bit tight. And I settled in after that.

 Q. After all these years, you can still get tight for a first major?
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah. I don't think I should be out here if you're not a little bit nervous and, you know, have your expectations high going into the first round. So yeah, I mean I shouldn't be out here if I don't feel that.

 Q. Just generally the conditions, was it good? Was it tough?
 KARRIE WEBB: Pretty mild until we got to play 11th, 12th, the wind started picking up. And then just trying to work out what directions sort of switched, cornered back and forth but I was actually surprised at how firm the greens were today, I think even from when I finished my Pro Am to teeing off at 8:00 this morning they were really, really firm and probably picked up at least six inches of speed overnight as well.

 Q. Really? 
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah.

 Q. Does that kind of tell you that it'll be a tough weekend?
 KARRIE WEBB: Yeah. You know, when we played the practice round on Monday, the greens were pretty slow, you know, for this tournament, this standard. And you know, Monday you would have thought that there was going to be low scores out here, and that's still the case. I mean if you're hitting fairways and hitting good iron shots, you know, you can shoot a low number out here, but you know, as the week goes on, we've got the heat. I just don't see the greens getting any slower or softer, so it's going to be a tough challenge come Sunday.
