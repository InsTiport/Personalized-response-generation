Q.   Happy to be here to officially say congratulations to you on winning for the 39th time out here on the LPGA Tour, the second time this year.   You won earlier in Australia.   Does this ever get old?
KARRIE WEBB:   It never gets old.   It never gets any easier either.   Today was extremely tough, and I'm just glad that I pulled it out.
I didn't think coming down ‑‑ I knew I needed to make one birdie, I thought because I didn't think I could just par in and feel comfortable, so great birdie on the last.

Q.   You've won so many times in so many different ways, how does this rank among your wins?
KARRIE WEBB:   It ranks up there.   You know, I've never really had a decent shot.   I've played here probably, I don't know, 15 times and I've never really had a decent shot of winning this tournament.   And actually my grandma at home has been ill and in the hospital this week and we actually thought that she was going to pass, and she told me that I had to win this tournament for her.   And she's on the mend fortunately, but still, it's for her.

Q.   Wow.   I'm sorry to hear that.   I'm sure you brought a big smile to her face with this great day of play. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Well, I don't think ‑‑ she's still in the hospital.   I don't think she got to watch it today, but I'm sure my mom and dad will fill her in.

Q.   Well, great job digging down deep and doing whatnot many have done and you get a ShopRite win for the first time in your career.   Congratulations. 
KARRIE WEBB:   Thanks.
