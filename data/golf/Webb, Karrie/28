Q.   Thoughts on your day? 
KARRIE WEBB:   Very solid.   I feel like 5‑under is perhaps the worst I could have shot, so that's always a nice thing to say.   But felt very comfortable out there.   Hit a lot of quality iron shots, so happy with that.

Q.   Both you and Stacy have a good history here.   Does it help at all when you have two players who are playing a course really well? 
KARRIE WEBB:   I think so, and I think Stacy and I have similar games as far as distances and stuff like that.   And I've played a lot‑‑ well, I've played every tournament this year with Stacy, so we're quite familiar with each other‑‑ well, every tournament we have both been at. 

Q.   So you're pleased with your position obviously. 
KARRIE WEBB:   It's a good start.   If anything's been lacking in the last six to ten months, it's been my first round start, so happy with the start. 

Q.   What's the game plan now with the quick turnaround? 
KARRIE WEBB:   Try and get something to eat.   Maybe just check to make sure my body is ready to go for another 18.
