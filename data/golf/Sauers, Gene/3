Q. To be able to get back playing and then to be able to get on to, you know, this Tour and to have this second lease of life, what does that mean to have concluded that particular journey today.
GENE SAUERS: Well, you know, it hasn't sunk in yet.  It's been a long time, and I'm at a loss for words right now.
Being back to playing with these guys, it's a pleasure.  I didn't think I'd ever be here.  I told my wife, when I was in the hospital, I didn't think I was ever coming out.  She kept me strong, Tammy.
I'm just honored to be here.  I'm at a loss for words right now.  Starting to sink in, I think.
Q. That's good news because it's absolutely true.  You've got the Francis Ouimet trophy.  You have the gold medal around your neck.  You are the 2016 U.S. Senior Open champion, Gene Sauers, as we head back to Joe.
