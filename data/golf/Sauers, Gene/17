  GENE SAUERS: I made a birdie on 2, and then what did I do, bogeyed 3, birdied 4, doubled 5, birdied 6.  And if I just get rid of them bogeys, I will be all right. I woke up this morning and I have a little bit of a fever, so in this heat it just kind of took it out of me today.  I just made sure I was ready to hit that shot when it was my turn to hit to save up my energy.Q. 2-under in the first round of a Senior Open has to be something you're proud of.GENE SAUERS: Oh, very proud, especially on a golf course like this.  This is a really tough golf course, demanding.  You have to hit every tee shot, think your way around this golf course. Kind of reminds me a log of Augusta.  Augusta might be more funner to play than this golf course, but you're just mentally drained after your round, which I am today.  Same thing like Augusta.  You think of every shot, every chip, every putt.  You're grinding all day long.  You get off of that 18th green finally, boom, it hits you.Q. The wind picking up in the afternoon, it probably added to...GENE SAUERS: It did.  We were on, on that par-5, like 7.  I think some of the guys were getting home in 2.  I couldn't even sniff it.  I hit a good drive, laid it up with a 4-iron and then I gap wedged it to the green.  That wind pretty much came up those four, five holes. I just made sure I just stuck to my game plan, tried to hit fairways and greens and have opportunities at birdies.Q. Good distance here.  A lot left.GENE SAUERS: Three more days, and just as long as you just stay calm and comfortable and try to just stay with my game plan, you just never know.
