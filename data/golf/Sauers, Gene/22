Q.   Basically just tell us what happened at 15.
GENE SAUERS:   Felt pretty good over the tee shot.   I pull‑hooked it left out‑of‑bounds and then did the same thing on the next two shots, but it stayed inbounds and then I 3‑putted.   Hit a bad chip shot and 3‑putted.   Gave the greens a little too much respect, thinking they were really fast, gave them too much respect and left it way short and I 3‑putted.   That's two big numbers in two tournaments that I've let get away. 

Q.   How about, you come right back and birdie 16, so eventually gets you into a playoff?
GENE SAUERS:   Yeah, Smiley (ph) told me, just birdie the last three.   Sure, it could happen and I hit a good shot 7‑iron in there on 16 and made the putt, probably 15 feet. 
You know, 17, I didn't hit a good shot, and of course 18, I was in‑between clubs all three times.   I just wasn't comfortable.

Q.   What happened back there with the ruling by the tree?
GENE SAUERS:   Well, my right foot was in ant bed, so got relief from that. 

Q.   You hit what second shot?
GENE SAUERS:   I hit 8‑iron and didn't catch all of it, and of course you saw the results.

Q.   On 15, it wasn't a great tee shot like you said but you hit the downslope and that didn't help you at all?
GENE SAUERS:   I don't know, just a bad swing.   I felt good over the tee shot, that's just a stupid mistake; to make a big number like that is just uncalled for. 

Q.   I know you 3‑putted, were you still thinking about the tee shot when you were putting out or had you already forgotten about that?
GENE SAUERS:   Yeah, a little bit, saying, how could you do just a stupid thing.   I would have been better blocking it right in that bunker over there, but that's golf.
