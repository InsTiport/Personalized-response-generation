Q.   I guess to start with, can you give a few general comments about your round today?
GENE SAUERS:   I hit the ball pretty solid most of the day except for two holes.   I went bogey, bogey on 7 and 8, which were some of the easiest holes on the golf course.   And I just kind of mentally went dead there for a couple few minutes there. 
But other than that I played pretty solid, made a birdie on the back, on like 13, I think it was, or 14, one of them, parâ€‘4 there.   And I feel good about my game.   Hitting the ball solid.   I kind of got a little froze up there on the putting so I left a few of them short.   But other than that I did all right and looking forward to the weekend.

Q.   How is the golf course playing today?   Pretty soft?
GENE SAUERS:   Yeah, well it's kind of soft today.   I got two mud balls today.   From the fairway.   But you never know which direction they're going, but you hit and hope.   The golf course played good today.   The greens weren't really firm, they were holding shots and they were putting good.   I think they were around 11 I think so the golf course is in great shape.
