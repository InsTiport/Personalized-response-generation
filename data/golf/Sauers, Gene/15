Q. What a day it's been for Gene Sauers.  You felt very lethargic when you teed off, running a fever.  Where did you find the strength to play that kind of round, especially at the end?GENE SAUERS: I just kept telling my caddy give me that towel so I can keep cool.  When I woke up, I felt good on Friday.  Then it came back again today. You know, I just told my caddy, keep me cool and keep me hydrated, all that kind of stuff.  I just kind of mustered everything up.  Every time I hit that shot, the last few seconds, just keep that good attitude and mindset and just try to, you know, hit your shots and I did very well.Q. We talked a lot today, Gene, about your longer-term health issues, but it seemed to me walking around with you that there were times out there where you just felt happy to be out there as opposed to thinking about winning the championship.GENE SAUERS: You're right.  That's the attitude I have to take.  I was so hard on myself on the regular tour, beating myself up week after week after week.  Actually, after all my illness, the good Lord said I'm going to give you another chance.  Bogey doesn't matter that much anymore. That's when I learned to have a great time and tried to hit everything I was capable of doing, and it worked out today.Q. What will the next 20 hours be like for you before you tee off tomorrow?GENE SAUERS: Like I said, I'm going to take it easy, go to Chick-fil-A for some chicken and go to bed and hopefully wake up and not think about it.
