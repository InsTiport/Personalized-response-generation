GENE SAUERS:   I grew up playing blades, but I got away from them with the cavity backs.  I'm controlling the ball flight and distance much better with these clubs.

Out West, I was driving the ball well and putting well, but hitting terrible iron shots.  I'm still playing with the mindset to win every weekend.  If I wasn't, I wouldn't be out here.  I would be back home painting houses.

Jay was a great guy to play with today.  There are a lot of low numbers out there today.  That is what happens when you put us out there with no wind.

I don't know if it will take another 64 tomorrow but I think I have to at least plan on a 65 or 66 to win.
