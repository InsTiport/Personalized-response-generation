Q. You've been through so much with your health and whatnot to get back to this point to have a putt at the 72nd hole, a chance to win and a playoff.  What's going through your mind?GENE SAUERS: Well, I gave it my best.  I guess I just may have misread that putt the first time around, didn't play enough break.  Hit a good putt, broke right at the hole at the last second. I'm just glad to be here and thank the Lord to be playing with my friends again.  I feel good about my game, and, you know, there's always next week.
