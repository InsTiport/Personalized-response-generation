Q.   So when you came to the course today, did you think today's the day or did you maybe think you had 5‑under already? 
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah, today.   I was thinking 4‑under for today.   That was my goal for today.   But I saw the wind was blowing super hard, so I changed my goal to maybe even par. 
Yeah, and then I birdied on the first hole, second hole, third hole, and then thought maybe this is the day.

Q.   I'm sure you've thought about this moment many times, thought about getting your first win.   How does it feel now to be an LPGA winner? 
ILHEE LEE:   I can't believe it right now.   It feels amazing, awesome.

Q.   And then the last one, I know you worked very hard on your golf, but also on your English too.   When you came here you spoke very little English?
ILHEE LEE:   Zero English.

Q.   And you decided to go stay with private housing, right? 
ILHEE LEE:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   Talk about why you did that and why you wanted to force yourself to learn English? 
ILHEE LEE:   Because this is America.   I have to follow them, their language here.   So English was first starting to learn from friends and then staying in housing, and then started to learn from there.   I think I did okay right now.

Q.   I think you did too. 
ILHEE LEE:   Thank you.
