Q. Ilhee, you're 9-under par after two rounds.  What's been the key to your week so far?
ILHEE LEE: I've been putting great this week and hitting close to the hole this week, so yeah, there's a lot of opportunities to make birdies here.
Q. Is that something you've been working on recently, your short game and shoring that up going into this week?
ILHEE LEE: Yeah, for the second shot going to the hole, I try to make say 48 inches.  It's not too aggressive to the hole.  That helps a lot.  Yeah.
Q. Did you have a feeling that you might have a good week going into this week?
ILHEE LEE: I do.  I do have that definitely, yeah.  At the beginning of the week on like Monday, I felt that right away.  I have confidence this week.
Q. And you won back in 2013.  What would it mean to you this week or somewhere close down the line to get back into the winner's circle?
ILHEE LEE: Well, I would love to, going back up there.  But it's not that, it's more, next hole or next shot tomorrow and Sunday.  So try to go one at a time.
