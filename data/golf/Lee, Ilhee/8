Q.   Good round to start.   I think that was your best round this year by three shots, I think.   That's what it looked like.   You finished 64? 
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.

Q.   Was everything kind of clicking or everything felt very good? 
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah, the putter was good today.   Yeah, the putter was good for today.

Q.   Everything else just kind of was okay, but the putting was on? 
ILHEE LEE:   Everything was good.   Driver was good, and the 6‑iron was good, the putter was good.

Q.   And the putter was on?
ILHEE LEE:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   Has that been something that you haven't been doing so well recently on or was that something that you were working on? 
ILHEE LEE:   I was trying to read the grain first on the green.   I think that helps a lot.

Q.   So you thought you read the greens pretty well?
ILHEE LEE:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   You already have one win this year.   That was your first win.   Everything was good, you celebrated.   Any turning point after that that you thought I can win out here and that you maybe really trying to get that second win? 
ILHEE LEE:   No, actually, I did not.   I just did what I did before so, yeah, because I was kind of lucky with it.   So it was just a good‑‑ I felt like that was just a good week.

Q.   Do you expect to stay up there in the coming days?   Are you 7‑under? 
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah, 7‑under par.

Q.   Do you think you can maintain that performance?   Are you trying to maintain that or improve anything in the next couple of days? 
ILHEE LEE:   My goal was 3‑under par every day this week, so I feel like I'm okay for the next couple days, I think.   So, yeah, it's okay.   It's fun.

Q.   So you already broke your original goal, so you think that might take a little pressure off you?
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.

Q.   So you'll keep trying to relax and do the same thing? 
ILHEE LEE:   Right.

Q.   You've played here the last three years? 
ILHEE LEE:   Played here?   This is my second year playing here.

Q.   Tied for 16th last year? 
ILHEE LEE:   Yes.

Q.   So you like this course?   You played pretty well last year. 
ILHEE LEE:   I think I'm okay with hot weather.

Q.   Hot weather, no rain. 
ILHEE LEE:   All right.   Good.   Thank you.
