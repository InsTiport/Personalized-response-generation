Q.   Talk about the bogey on 2, a little rough start but you bounced back.
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah, what was it, missed short putt...

Q.   On 2?
ILHEE LEE:   On 2.   It was like less than three feet.

Q.   You were frustrated a little bit?
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.   I mean, I think I tried too hard.   I tried to like make everything.

Q.   Right.
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah, but after that was okay.   My driver was not good, but I knew it's hard to play four days in a row.   So this is very good day for me.

Q.   Right.   You didn't lose too much ground, which is good.
ILHEE LEE:   Uhâ€‘huh.

Q.   You're happy about that, that you're right in the mix?
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.

Q.   How do you feel about tomorrow in terms of being second and right there?
ILHEE LEE:   Last hole birdie was big for tomorrow, I think.   I will having fun tomorrow, too.

Q.   Yeah, I'm sure.   Birdie on 18, cutting it to three strokes versus four, how big was that?
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah, I knew that's going to be big for tomorrow.

Q.   Anything specifically you want to make sure you get done for tomorrow that you think will be needed to win?
ILHEE LEE:   Tomorrow?

Q.   Yeah.
ILHEE LEE:   I don't know.   Enjoy.

Q.   Just have fun?
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah, just have fun out there.
