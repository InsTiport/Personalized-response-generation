Q.   So how would you describe your week this week, finishing at 16‑under?
ILHEE LEE:   Well, like today first front nine, I thought this weekend is not my weekend.   Every putt goes so close but didn't go in.   But my caddie, he told me, be patient because it's going to go in.   Then I had seven holes left, and made birdie, five feet from the par3, and made it, and then I start to feel like I can make more. 
But then I made eagle putt, that was like 20 feet away.   And like this far, birdie, right next hole.   I mean, finished strong.   I'm happy.   I'm happy for I finished strong. 

Q.   What's your plan now?   Pretty close to the lead.   Are you going to wait around and see how things finish? 
ILHEE LEE:   I don't know.   I plan to go to Carlsbad today driving.   But this golf course have lots of chance to make birdie the back nine.   So I will go right across the street and wait a little bit. 

Q.   And finally, if you don't end up in a playoff or anything, how do you take the momentum from this week into the next couple of events on the West Coast? 
ILHEE LEE:   Okay, so today is the water‑‑ world water day I think.   They text me this morning that it's world water day, something like that.   I told my friend, if I make money, like plenty money this week, I will help for the Africa to help build pipe things for the water.   So I keep thinking about that, I want to make more birdie for them.   I think that ends up really good.
