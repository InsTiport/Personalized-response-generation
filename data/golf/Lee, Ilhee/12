Q.   Great playing.   Seven birdies in the first 12 holes.   Did you feel really good about your game today?
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.   First 12 holes was the driver and second shot, and then putting in hole or like tap‑in, par.   It was really fun first 12 hole.
And then, yeah. 

Q.   What was the biggest thing?   Approach shots?   Were you hitting it close?
ILHEE LEE:   First 12 holes I feel putt was feel really good, so that's why I made many, many birdies first 12. 

Q.   And as you said, a few weeks ago you didn't even know you were going to play this event. 
ILHEE LEE:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   So just coming in with the approach of trying to do the best you can and take advantage of the opportunity?
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.   I mean, I was not really good position, I mean, to play here before U.S. Open.   I play really good week.   I had really good tournament U.S. Open, so I made this event. 
Yeah, it's like bonus. 

Q.   And having played well at the U.S. Open, do you feel like your carrying that confidence and the way you've been playing into this week?
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.   First, I feel comfortable with this year, first, because I can make card easily.
Then, yeah, everything is changed for me.   I can play few more‑ a lot more‑ events.   I can play a lot more, so it made a lot of difference. 

Q.   That helps in the confidence level.   It's amazing when you talk to players about confidence how much that changes things for everyone.   Hee Young Park was saying after she won her first event how that carries over and it just snow balls. 
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.   Confidence is important for the golf.
