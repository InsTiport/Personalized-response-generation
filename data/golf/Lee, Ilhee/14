 Q.   So you were one under today.   
IL HEE LEE:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about your round.   
IL HEE LEE:   It was pretty, I mean, boring.   Three birdies, and then two bogeys.   
   
 Q.   So you had one of the bogeys on 18?   
IL HEE LEE:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   What happened there?   
IL HEE LEE:   That was my 9th hole.   Yeah.   Cut from five yards before the green off the green.   So putted, and then it was like three feet to the right.   So‑‑ yeah, three.   
   
 Q.   But you were able to come back from that.   
IL HEE LEE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   You had another birdie there on 11.   
IL HEE LEE:   Uh‑huh.   11‑‑  
   
 Q.   I should say, excuse me.   Right at the very end.   
IL HEE LEE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   So you finished strong.   
IL HEE LEE:   Yes.   I hit another bogey on the par‑3.   I tried to hit from the hedges.   It was long, way long.   Like 30 yards behind.   I had putting, and then 10 feet‑‑ more than 10 feet that was my bogey putt.   
And then I had par‑5‑‑ next par‑5, ten feet from the left.   Made it.   Then par‑3 eight feet.   The birdie.   
   
 Q.   Is that a good feeling to have the two birdies at the end?   
IL HEE LEE:   Yeah, of course.   
   
 Q.   The weekend, how does that help you?   
IL HEE LEE:   I don't know.   Maybe, yeah.   First I‑‑ this is my first U.S. Open in my life, so it's really exciting for me.   Yeah.   I'm happy to make the putt.   
   
 Q.   Fantastic.   So it's been a good experience.   
IL HEE LEE:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   What has the weather been like.   It was hot yesterday and maybe not so hot today?   
IL HEE LEE:   I think I've been a little bit lucky.   Yesterday was a little bit hot, but today was‑‑ last eight holes wasn't really hot.   So it was good.   
   
 Q.   Thank you very much.   
IL HEE LEE:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   Sleep well.   
IL HEE LEE:   Okay.
