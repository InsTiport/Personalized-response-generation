  ILHEE LEE:   9 would be really good.   
   
 Q.   Ilhee, you just said 9 would be really good.   But still, you tied the course record.   How much fun was it today playing like that?  
ILHEE LEE:   It was like not me, like just kept playing, playing golf, with like really good shots and putts really good.   After at some point I forgot how much birdie I made, how many birdies I made already, and then I just kept kept going.  
   
 Q.   So you just got in a zone?  
ILHEE LEE:   Right.   Called peak performance, something like that.  
   
 Q.   Yes.   
ILHEE LEE:   That's my best score.  
   
 Q.   Oh, yeah.   So you and two others, Se Ri, Morgan, all tied the course record this week.   Why do you think that is?  
ILHEE LEE:   Okay.   I play with Morgan.   I learn from her.   Tell her I try to copy her today.   
   
 Q.   Perfect.   So regardless of what happens on 18, you're very, very happy with today, aren't you?  
ILHEE LEE:   Yeah.   I thought I can finish 9‑under par.   I mean I‑‑ yeah, but it was fun, fun anyways.   
I think it's really good for‑‑ really good day for to have confidence for next week.   I think that's important for me.   
   
 Q.   Now, what part of your game was working the best today?  
ILHEE LEE:   I mean scoring 8‑under par has to be everything really good.   I mean putting was‑‑ especially putting was good.   Reading putts got better than first day here, because I used to the green more than before.
