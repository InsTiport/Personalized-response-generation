 RICHARD FINCH: A lot of hard work, I got off to a great start birdieing the first hole, which was nice, but it was a struggle really to be honest. I didn't hit that many fairways and the front nine I was hitting it to the right and the back nine towards the end, I kept hitting to the left.  
 It was a struggle and didn't really hole much, but was never really near enough to make that many birdies. Pleased that I'm not out of it and that I'm not that far away, but by the same rule, if I knew I was going to play like that all day, it was going to be a tough, long, hard day.  
  
  Q. When you come back to the course tomorrow, regrouped, you know that you've actually played well enough in tough conditions.   
 RICHARD FINCH: Yeah, I don't know what the scoring has been like today, but I know it's difficult to go sort of really low like it was yesterday.   
 Yeah, it was tough, and I'm sure it was for everyone, especially if you got in the rough with it being wet. And obviously the conditions of the fairways have really made it very difficult, and if you're not quite spot on with where you hit the ball, if you get the ground first, you sort of know about it because you get covered in mud. It's been tough, but if you play well, you can do well. I just didn't play that well today.   
  
  Q. You're certainly in a fine position for the weekend, which is ideal.   
 RICHARD FINCH: Yeah, definitely, I've obviously got to play a lot better. I'd like to play more like I did in the first round than I did today to really challenge. I certainly feel like I've ground it out and that's my bad round, and hopefully I can regroup tomorrow and go out and do another good weekend.
