  RICHARD FINCH:   Pleased with the score.   Present it's only one off the lead but that may change or may not.   Overall pleased with the score.   Form over the last nine months has not been too clever overall, some good results but overall hopefully it not that far away.   Even today was a bit of a struggle.   I was not quite on it like I would like to have been in and control of the golf ball if you like.   A bit more work to be done to try and knock it up another level if you like.   
But, yeah, score‑wise, that's good.   I'd take probably another three of those and be very happy.   Mostly depends on the weather out here.   The course is not easy.   Tough to reach greens that are soft.   You've got many back pin positions and it's difficult to get close, and the shortest putts, you have a lot of traffic on the greens.  
It's not easy scoring out there and with the wind changing, it changes every now and again, so you have to be on your toes.   All in all a good first day.  
The wind is getting up and certainly makes you think when you're playing off sloping lies and the wind is varying all the time as it is.   You have to be spot on really.  
   
 Q.   What has made the difference compared to recent out comes then?   
RICHARD FINCH:   Just a crazy game, it's like any other sport I suppose.   You can do all the right things and it cannot work out and other times you can feel like you're not doing well and it all works out, great.   
You can have a football stripe, going off his knee and all the rest of it and he can get in good positions and not score for weeks.   It s just a crazy game.   Nothing massively difference.   I holed some nice putts at the right time and that was the difference today.   But still third, and I just have to improve in just about every department a little bit to keep contending and get up there.  
   
 Q.   I take it like most people, you are always looking for that little bit extra; that extra thing that will actually make all the difference?   
RICHARD FINCH:   Yeah, definitely.   It's small margins but the small margins at the end of the day add up to a big difference.   The standard is that where if you're not spot on nowadays, then you're nowhere.   So it's important to keep trying to improve and get better.   
   
 Q.   Does that mean you change regimes?   
RICHARD FINCH:   A little.   
   
 Q.   Fitness?   
RICHARD FINCH:   Well, change fitness into doing some.   Swing‑wise, I probably had three different swings out there today, so that tells where I am; tried that, that didn't feel right.   Tried that, that feels a bit better.   Stuck with that the last nine holes.   
Yeah, you're always changing, trying to improve but sometimes, yeah, you've got to work with what you've got and maybe just polish that sometimes than doing too many wholesale changes.   But that's probably‑‑ striving to improve is how a lot of the guys out here got here because that's what you have to do.   You have to continue to strive to improve and you can't just stand still, because otherwise you go backwards.
