  Q. Nick, 69 today, six birdies out there. I mean, you were having a really good run at it.   
 NICK FLANAGAN: Yeah, I started off a little slow. I didn't feel very good the first three or four holes, and then I started holing a few putts and just hit some pretty good iron shots most of the day, which I didn't feel like I had been doing on the range all week. So it was good to get out there and do it during the first round and hit a lot of fairways, so that helped.  
  
  Q. I've got to ask you one thing. Did you really go at that flag on 17?  
 NICK FLANAGAN: No, I tried to draw it in there but I didn't try to draw it in there that close.  
  
  Q. It looked awful a brave from where we were.   
 NICK FLANAGAN: It was a good miss in the end.  
  
  Q. And you were terribly unlucky with the putt on 18.   
 NICK FLANAGAN: Yeah, I knew that putt looked like it should go left, but I knew it wasn't going to go as far left as it probably should have. I gave it a good run, and it just stayed on that right edge the whole way. It was probably a little bit too firm. But it still caught a bit of it, which was lucky.  
  
  Q. You must be well satisfied with your position after this first round because you've been playing well now for quite a while and maybe deserve a little bit more to show for it.   
 NICK FLANAGAN: Yeah, this year has been a bit of a struggle so far. I haven't struck the ball as well as I did last year. I obviously had a career year last year, and I'm just trying to get back into that frame of mind, just hitting greens and letting it happen. And I've kind of been trying to force it a little bit too much so far. I've been playing well the last couple weeks, so hopefully I can keep it going for a little longer.
