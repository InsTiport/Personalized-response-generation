GABRIEL HJERTSTEDT:  It was weird, nothing was happening today.  I have always said that whatever happens, happens.  I had a chip-in on 15 that got me started.  I had a hell of a shot there from off the green.  It was disappointing on the last hole.  I was shooting for the middle of the green and the grass pulled it left. 
 
Q.  (Regarding getting himself into contention tomorrow)
 
GABRIEL HJERTSTEDT:  That was my goal today.  I felt like I am starting to play good again for the first time in a long time.  My goal today was to go out and shoot 65 but I am a couple off that.  Just have to cut down on the mistakes tomorrow.  I have had three bogeys everyday.  You get in a zone and you don't try to force it.  You have to have patience and hit a lot of good shots.  On 13 hit 3-wood, 3-wood, and chipped in.  On 14, hit a 9-iron to about three yards. On 15, the par 5, hit driver, 3-wood, and chipped in from offer the green from about 30 yards.  On 16, hit driver, lob wedge to about two feet.  On 17, hit 6-iron to six feet.
