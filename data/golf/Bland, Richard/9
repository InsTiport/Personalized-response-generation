RICHARD BLAND: It's tough, I thought with six to play, I thought it was there.  It was anybody's, really.  Yeah, I hit some -- I thought I hit a good shot at 16 and it just hit the wind a little bit.  I hit a poor chip.  Just kind of came out with no spin and just went by.  And then 17, I didn't think I hit that poor of a tee shot at 17 and it's just got -- you couldn't put it in a worser place.  It's tough.  But I'll keep trying.
Q. There's so much to be so proud of, isn't there, particularly the way you started and stayed involved, not only on the final day but throughout the course of the week with some superlative golf?
RICHARD BLAND: Where I was on Tuesday, you know, if someone would have offered me fourth, I would have probably snapped their hand off.  I feel differently now, but I wasn't great on Tuesday.  Tim did an unbelievable job in getting me back to so near my best, and I knew it was going to take a huge effort today; Alex, he's impressed me so much.  Fair play to him.
Q. Having played alongside him, what was it that made him so good?
RICHARD BLAND: He just doesn't make any mistakes.  He hits it great.  He putts the lights out if he needs to.  Every part of his game is right there and there's why I would imagine he's probably.  I don't know where he would be now, probably top 30 in the world.  I can only see him going higher.
But hopefully that's got me nearer top hundred in the world.  I've got the HSBC now, which is, if someone had offered me that at the start of the year, I'd have probably laughed at them.
Yeah, there's still -- yeah, obviously I've got to get over the disappointment of this, but I've got four unbelievable weeks to come and I'll keep trying.
