Q. One shot shy, how are you feeling?
RICHARD BLAND: Next question.  Yeah, I'm pretty gutted.  But I gave it a good run.  I just got caught in-between clubs on 17, and the only shot I didn't commit to all day.  And even the poor shots that I hit today, I was committed to them, and that was the only one I just didn't commit to.  So you know, proud of the two shots I hit on the last and just didn't quite hole the putts.
But you know, I'll come back next week and try it again.
Q. Maybe later, you'll sit back and realise how good this has been for you and your confidence?
RICHARD BLAND: Yeah, I think so.  The form that I've been showing the last three, four months, if someone offered me second place or a putt to make a playoff on 18, I'd probably snap my hand off.
Yeah, it's a big step forward for me this week, and I've just got to make sure that I keep making steps forward and finish the year strong.
