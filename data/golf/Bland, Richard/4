RICHARD BLAND: Brutal from shot one to shot 72.  So, yeah, it was a cup of tea.  And I don't know, sit down in a padded cell, I think (laughing).   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD BLAND: Yeah, yeah.  I was fully aware.  Yeah, it was just -- the weather was just changing the whole time.  You kind of thought, oh, it looks like it's brightening up.  And then 15 minutes later it's just hosing it down again.  You just couldn't really get into much of a rhythm.  And then when it just starts raining, my hands have gone all pruney, because the skin is just damp.  And on the last I was just hanging on it for dear life on the tee shot at the last.  So it was just tough right from the start.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD BLAND: Yeah, you had to make four at the last will make that tea taste a little bit sweeter.  It was a real grind coming in.  And I really felt like I wanted to stay under par for the tournament.  And I was working hard to do that.  Like I say, just to stay as in touch as you can, and hopefully I don't know what the weather is going to bring us tomorrow.  Sitting there with a chance, five back with 36 to play is a good position.  Yes, there's world-class players in front.  But I'm playing good, and hopefully if the weather holds out, I can hopefully put a run together.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD BLAND: It would be nice to have a lie-in.  It looks like I'm going to have another one tomorrow.  Hopefully I'll have a real nice lie-in Sunday, as well.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD BLAND: Yeah, of course it is.  This is why we hit so many balls and practise so many hours.  Yeah, I know I haven't won a tournament yet, but, hey, why not this one?  So I'm not here just to wear the numbers off.  I've proved over the years that I can compete with the best, and I'm looking forward to doing that over the weekend.
