   RICHARD BLAND: It was nice this morning. I would have preferred to play with someone but at least you don't have to worry about pace of play. You get into a nice rhythm. You don't have to bust a gut to get round, but amble all and see what happens. I played at my own pace. The weather made it a bit tricky with the wind picking up and no help in terms of clubbing by watching others. Always nice on par threes if you don't have the honour to watch what happens but I was pretty much spot on today with my distances. Got the ball up to the flag and was in control all the way round.  
 Hopefully I won't be playing on my own tomorrow. I was playing with Gary Lockerbie late on last night and he birdied the ninth to knock out all the plus ones. I was surprised being level par for the cut. I thought I had a shot in hand. It was a good cut, level par. The greens were difficult yesterday afternoon once the sun went late on. You could miss very short ones.  
 The wind picked up in the last four holes today, from about 15 or 16. I didn't have a sniff of the green at 16 and 18. Hopefully it blows out but not enough for balls to move and they call it off. I didn't have any problems there.  
 The season so far? I've been hitting it well enough but struggling on the greens, which is not like me. I've been struggling there and it shows no matter how well you play if you don't hole putts and get up and down you won't achieve anything. Hopefully I can put together another good round tomorrow. I don't check the Order of Merit. I've been out here long enough not to worry about that.
