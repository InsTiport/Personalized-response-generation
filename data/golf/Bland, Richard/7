Q. How was it for you?
RICHARD BLAND: Yeah, it was a bit of an up-and-down day.  I played some good golf, a little scrappy in places, but overall, pretty pleased with it.  The last sort of nine holes, the wind was really starting to get up a little bit and made it play a little tougher.
So yeah, I played the back nine pretty solid, which was nice.  When it got tough, I seemed to play a little bit better, which is always a nice thing.  Yeah, if someone had offered me 8-under after two rounds with the form I've been showing recently, I'd snap my hand off.
Q. 1-under par the first five holes but that didn't really tell the story, did it.
RICHARD BLAND: Started great, birdied the first two and then we got the wind wrong at the third and came up a club and a half short and made bogey and then yeah, the fourth hole, just leak it a little right into a divot, got no shot, and then birdied five.  It was a bit kind of, yeah, a bit up-and-down.
But then I kind of played better after that, and I was pleased with the way I played the back nine when it got tough.
Q. And 18, agonisingly short.
RICHARD BLAND: Yeah, thought I hit a good putt.  It's one of those, I thought it probably had just enough to get there but putting maybe just back into the wind.  Maybe that knocks an inch or two off the putt, I don't know.  But I'm not really going to worry too much about that.  I'm in a good position.  We've got 36 holes left, and hopefully if I can keep just try to keep improving, I should hopefully, might be in there come Sunday I.
Q. Nice lie-in tomorrow, as well.
RICHARD BLAND: It's nice, kind of like the cuts I've been making, I'm up at 5.00.  It will be nice to not really have to set at alarm too much and have a leisurely breakfast and then come up here.  Yeah, sort of Austria, I felt like I was up at 5.00 every day.  It's nice to be at the other end.
