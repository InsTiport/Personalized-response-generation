  Q. How good a day was that for you?  
 RICHARD BLAND: Pretty nice, pretty stress free to be honest. Yesterday I played steady for 69 and again today I wasn't really in any trouble or fighting to make any pars and holed a couple of nice putts. The course is definitely playing differently now to how it played in practice and in the first round. You can take a bit more advantage of the par fives now but if you do hit it off line you are struggling.  
  
  Q. It is a bit strange that the score were so good on day one when conditions were so difficult and overall it hasn't been too great yesterday and today when conditions are relatively benign?  
 RICHARD BLAND: Well you would expect the quality of the field that once you get conditions like this then everyone would go pretty deep. But the greens are not easy to putt on, there is quite a lot of grain on them and I've been foxed a few times with the way the ball has broken on the line. But you only have to be a very very small percentage out here and you can struggle. Maybe everyone is just a little bit off.  
  
  Q. Is this more satisfying shooting a good score on day three than on day one as you did last week?  
 RICHARD BLAND: Well, you always like to come out of the blocks quickly in a tournament to get yourself right in there but obviously there is more time then for stuff to happen. But Saturday is a huge day in a lot of ways especially for the guys a bit further down because they know that a round of five or six under par can really do some damage.
