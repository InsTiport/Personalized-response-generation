   RICHARD BLAND: What can I say - it was inspirational the way that he plays, it is very tough to describe. I saw him in the hotel at the start of the week and your first reaction when you see someone with one leg is that you feel sorry for him. I saw him and obviously never thought for a minute that he would be playing the tournament. Then I saw him on Sky News last night and realised and introduced myself and he was just so excited about playing - he couldn't wait to get going.   
  
 He hardly hit it offline, hardly hit a bad shot today and when he does go offline he has a lot of short game and putts pretty good. You just stand there thinking how phenomenal it is. He is so strong: his forearms are like thighs and your hand just disappears when you shake hands with him. He is so strong throughout his body and he is a great guy who does everything with a smile on his face. Inspirational.
