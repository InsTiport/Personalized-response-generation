   CRISTIE KERR:  You know, on 17 we got a good break.  Hard fought battle.  Kind of thought it was that.  We got off to a great start. 

 Q.  How did it go after the beginning? 
 PAT HURST:  Kind of at the end it was a little bit tough.  We got a half point.  That's all that matters. 

 Q.  How important was it to get off to a good start? 
 PAT HURST:  We're not -- what is this foursomes, what are we playing?  Foursomes, we don't usually get off to a good start with that.  Every little point that we can get is huge for us so, you know, we squeaked in a half point, and that was big for us. 

 Q.  Okay.  Give me some highlights of the match. 
 PAT HURST:  Highlights of the match.  We started off birdie, birdie, and I think this was key for us. 

 Q.  How is everything? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  I'm making everything that I'm looking at.
