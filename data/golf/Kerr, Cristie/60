Q. 4-under today.  What was the key to your strong play?
CRISTIE KERR: You know, I had a great attitude out there today.  Coming back from knee surgery, I didn't really expect much.
I had fun.  I didn't kill myself over the bad shots and I made some really good up and downs that kept my round going, and had a good finish.
Q. First event of the season.  What did you do in the off-season and how has it been so far?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I had knee surgery on November 29th and wasn't ready to come back for the Bahamas.  I feel good now.  I've been working really hard on rehab and getting my leg strong again.  I've been working with a trainer now for the last six weeks, which it's been a few years since I've done that.
I feel better.  I feel very lucky to be playing golf for a living.  I think having surgery kind of changed my perspective again for the better.
So I just played great today.  I didn't hit it great at times, but managed to scramble and kept my round going.
Q. When you had surgery at the end of November, when did you start getting back into the full swing of things?
CRISTIE KERR: I started practicing eight weeks, a little over eight weeks after surgery.  I had a little complication with a cyst bursting.  Wasn't really able to start back until a month ago.
It was like really refreshing to be able to go out and practice.  Sometimes you get into the grind of it and you kind of lose perspective that what you do is really great.  For a living you get to do what you love.
So every day I got to go out and practice I just felt very fortunate to be out there.  So it's been a good change in perspective.
Q. Last one.  Solheim year.  How big of a motivation for you is that?
CRISTIE KERR: Solheim has afforded me some amazing moments in my career and it's one of the things I look forward to the most, especially with Juli being captain again.  You know, go USA.
