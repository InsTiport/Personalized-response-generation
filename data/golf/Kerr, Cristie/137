Q.   Got it to 9‑under par.   Right now you're four shots back, within striking distance.   Talk about how you're playing?
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, you know, I played great today.   The conditions came in for us on the 15th hole.   Really just started raining a lot and became hard to make your normal swing.
So I feel like I dropped a couple shots on the last couple holes, but it made a good par n 18.   I expect that Stacy is gonna go lower, and I'm going to have to have a really low one in some bad conditions tomorrow to have a chance. 

Q.   Did the course play any differently after the weather?
CRISTIE KERR:   Well, I mean, after the green speeds got kind of erratic.   That's going to happen when it rains.   The rough, if you hit it in the rough, you're not going to get a nice fluffy lie.   You're going to get a lie that sits down.
I played good.   I had it going.   Made kind of a bad bogey on 10, but I came back with birdies on 12 and 13; then I missed short one on 14 and 15.   Just splitting hairs really. 
And then the weather came in.   So I'm glad to be done.

Q.   Last one:   Obviously you're a player that's capable of a four‑ or five‑shot comeback?
CRISTIE KERR:   Or eight.

Q.   Talk about your mentality going into tomorrow?
CRISTIE KERR:   Got to go low.   Obviously we have to see what the conditions are.   But I know that being this far back I'm going to have to shoot a low number and I'm going to have to get some help. 
Anything is possible.   Can't stop dreaming.
