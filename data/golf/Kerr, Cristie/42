Q. Well, we'll make it short because it was quite an experience out there for you today, and everyone, really.  What would you give yourself?  It was really quite remarkable to get in and have a round like you had.
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I played a lot better than the score today.  I had two 3-putts on the back which were kind of uncharacteristic.  Just got to do better.
