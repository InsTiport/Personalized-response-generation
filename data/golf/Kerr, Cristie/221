  Q. Pretty good way to start off the day. I was just talking to Paula earlier, and she said Cristie played "lights out." Talk about your day and as a team.   
 CRISTIE KERR: I did. I hit it really good, and I was just making a lot of putts. Kind of when I get on a roll, that's kind of what happens. Especially Paula was struggling a little bit because she had a lot of long clubs into greens, and it was great that I had some shorter clubs into greens to kind of take some of the pressure off her.  
 I just made some putts at the right time, and they kept coming back and kept making birdies.  
 I made a huge putt on 14, and then she made a huge putt on 16 to get us up. And then I had to answer Suzann's shot on 17 and made a great birdie there.   
 Then I just knew that I didn't want to have it come down to the last putt, so I wanted to go ahead and make a putt on 18. I played amazing today. I was probably 4- or 5-under, you know, on a very long golf course.   
  
  Q. There were a lot of solid putts made by you guys. Was there a turning point, or was it kind of just a collective --  
 CRISTIE KERR: I think we were 1-down going into 14, and I think my birdie putt on 14 was absolutely huge. 15, they missed, which kind of kept our momentum going, and then her putt on 16, you kind of started to believe it was going to be our match.  
 And then 17, when I hit it in there stiff right alongside Suzann, made that putt, we had the match in hand, and we just had to go ahead and birdie 18.   
  
  Q. It's been a long week. There's a lot of stuff that goes on.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Are you happy to be playing finally?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, definitely.
