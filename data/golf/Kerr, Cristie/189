   MODERATOR: Well, Cristie, welcome back. You're tournament leader, and obviously gave a few back on the back there. Just talk a little bit about the day and what happened on the double and the bogey.  
 CRISTIE KERR: I played great, you know. I had hit a couple shots to the right but hadn't really been penalizing. I missed 'em in the right spots. Just hit a really bad tee shot on -- I don't really -- I mean, it was very right.  
 So I did the right thing, chipped it out, and just tried to get on the green with a putt at it. Didn't manage to do that or get up-and-down, and that's how you make a double.  
 Good two-putt on 16; good par on 17. On 18 I hit it right off the tee again, and, you know, you got to try and fix it. So I hit it left into the bunker. It was a pretty easy up-and-down if I was in an decent lie, but I got in a horrible lie. I almost had no chance. I actually did great to get it where I put it.   
 That was my round.   
 MODERATOR: Is it something you know what it is, what the fix is?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I do. I kind of fixed it with the iron into 18, and unfortunately went too far left. My coach will see what it is, and I'll be able to talk to him.   
 Had I started out like that and finished with eight birdies, wouldn't be sitting here talking about it. I've got to just take the attitude that I had eight birdies and three bogeys basically still shot 5-under even with the bad finish.   
 MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Talk about the front nine, what was going so well for you.  
 CRISTIE KERR: Everything. I was hitting it well, knocking it close to the hole, making a lot of putts. Just read the momentum. Had a lot of fun on the front.  
 On the back, in the 14, I can't let the last five holes get me down. I have a lot of work to do tomorrow. I look forward to going to work on my game when I get done.  
  
  Q. Will you approach tomorrow like any other round?  
 CRISTIE KERR: You do. But, you know, having the lead is great, but extending it is better. That's what I was able to do at the LPGA Championship. Just got to try and do my mental stuff well.  
 I think the last five holes was more physical than mental. I think I'm just going to go to the range and kind of sort it out. That's it really.   
  
  Q. You probably have a lot of confidence going into tomorrow.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I got 20-under through two and a half rounds. So, yeah.   
  
  Q. Remind you of the LPGA Championship at all?  
 CRISTIE KERR: It's different. Feels different. You know, I didn't have anything like the finish I had today happen to me there.   
 You know, I'm still obviously fortunate to have the lead. People still shooting low out there. I'm going to try and go out there and extend it tomorrow.   
 MODERATOR: Thank you.
