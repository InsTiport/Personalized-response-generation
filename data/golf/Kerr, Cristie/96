 Q.   From your last win, Cristie Kerr, that was in Kingsmill and that was emotional because it was the first one your father ever witnessed.   This is the first one as a mother.   Does each win get more special for various reasons?  
CRISTIE KERR:   It does, and you know what, my caddie Greg's father passed away last week, and he wasn't with me in Phoenix.   I played for the both of us this week, and I said I was going to do it, and I did it and it made it that much more special for us as our first win together and for my son being there, my family, and probably‑‑ I mean this right here.  
   
 Q.   You are so self‑motivated and as intense a competitor as anybody.   Judy Rankin made the point that you've put in a lot of work without always seeing results the last couple of years.   How do you maintain that fire?  
CRISTIE KERR:   I mean I love to win, and you know what, golf has always been great to me, has always given me special moments like this, and I'm grateful for it and that's why I play the game.  
You know, I've been working with a new coach as well, and I definitely found something this week, so thank you, Michael.   He said I was going to have my hot round, and he was right.  
And you know, I can't even discount all the work that I've put in with my other coach, who's Miriam's coach, Bryan as well.   He's a great guy.   I just found something.   I got new stuff I'm working on, and I'm just real happy right now.  
   
 Q.   Special day and a special win.   Congratulations.   
CRISTIE KERR:   Thank you.
