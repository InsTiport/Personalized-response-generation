  Q. Tell me about your round today.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Um, you know, I didn't play that poorly. I made a really bad swing on 10 and paid the price for it, and, you know, I fought really hard the rest of the round.   
 You know, I was able to turn what could have been a really bad round into a 1-over round. I'm not out of it.  
 So, you know, I was able to kinda stay in there.  
  
  Q. Do you like your position going into the next two rounds? Make a charge?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I need to make up some ground, for sure. You know, it would have been better to be under par at this point, but there's two more days left.
