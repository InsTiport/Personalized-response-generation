   THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Cristie Kerr into the interview room. Runner-up finish, I know not what you were hoping for, but can you take us through the round today and what happened out there?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Well, I tell you, it played a little bit tougher today. I played great. Even the bogeys I made at 8 and 9 really weren't that bad. 8, I hit it right at the pin. And actually a little unlucky that it went right at the pin, because if you hit it a little bit left into the green where I was planning to, you have the slope to stop it. Made a good chip there and a good putt.   
 8, I did hook it a little off the tee, but I think the wind got it and it got a really wicked bounce and ended up pretty unlucky. Had to take an unplayable lie. As it was, I made a great 5, and I had a horrible lie in the bunker.   
 You know, you I played great today. Even the 3-wood I hit into the 9th hole, that is as good as I can hit a 3-wood. I hit a good chip. Got a little by the hole, and I hit the putt the way I wanted to. I mean, nothing went my way today. I made some great birdies early on, but nothing went my way.   
 I made a great putt at 14 again, almost chipped in on 15. 16, the wedge was right at the pin. I mean, you've got to get lucky to hit it close there with where they put the pin today, and almost made the putt on 17 and made birdie on 18.   
 So I have nothing to hang my head about. You can always say what if, and looking forward to next week.  
  
  Q. When you took your unplayable at No. 8, did you have any other options about where to take your drop? Looked like you had a horrible lie even where you dropped the ball?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, if I had taken two club lengths, it would have been in gnarly grass. Where I decided to take it back in line, there was at least a chance of getting a good lie. I got kind of -- not a good break there. I dropped it and it went right into a hole.   
 I only had 110 yards to the pin and I hit a gap wedge, and that was as good as it's going to come out of the lie. You know, it just wasn't a good situation. I made a heck of a bogey out of it, and those were really the only options.  
  
  Q. Were all the delays simply frustrating or just something you have to deal with?   
 CRISTIE KERR: They're something you have to deal with, with you they're a little frustrating at the same time. The officials I think told the tournament people we weren't going to play in four hours. I think we missed the finish on TV. I don't know. I don't know what happened there. Certainly you could tee off the first tee time at 7:30 and be guaranteed to be finishing on TV.   
 Again, not my call, but a 3:00 o'clock tee time is something you don't really even get at the U.S. Open, so I don't know what happened there.  
  
  Q. They did show the finish, but they kept switching back and forth from your field to here. Are you a leaderboard watcher or do you rather just concentrate on your own game and just check it?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I like to know where I stand, and that's great that we were able to get the finish on TV. It was an exciting finish. But I like to know where I am a little bit more on the back nine on Sunday when I tend to pay a little bit more attention to it. Got to kind of know what you have to do, and I almost did it again.  
  
  Q. Talk about the 18th hole?   
 CRISTIE KERR: The 18th hole I hit a great drive, ripped the 3-wood up there just short of the green, and I had to make it. It must have been 27 paces on. So that's 80 feet or 70 feet. It was actually in the heart. It was like five feet short, but it's tough to have to make an 80-foot eagle putt to make it into the playoff.   
 But I just wish I would have gotten it to the hole, but it was a great two-putt nonetheless. I saw where she made birdie and Mike Scanlan from the LPGA told me that she hit it in the junk left and got a good lie. That could have been an unplayable lie too.   
 It was obviously her week. Doesn't diminish my performance. I played great this week.
