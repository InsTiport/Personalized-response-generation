   THE MODERATOR:  We are joined by 11-time LPGA winner and South Florida native, Cristie Kerr. Cristie currently leads the second half ADT points list with 654,801 ADT points based on her most recent victories at the Safeway Classic and three of her top 10 finishes in her last five events on the LPGA Tour. Today's conference call with Cristie is the first in a series of ADT Championship teleconferences. Future conference calls with Lorena Ochoa, Annika Sorenstam and Inbee Park are scheduled for October. 

 Q. There is something about the ADT. I was curious what your thoughts were about how the format was tweaked last year and if you thought that made for a better Sunday than what you had the previous year? 
 CRISTIE KERR: Actually, it's funny. I thought last year's format was the way it was the first year. There was some confusion the first year with a couple of us kind of not knowing exactly, even though we tried to know what the format was. 
 Last year I thought the format was the way it should have been the first year. Where if it's a true playoff thing, it's a qualification every day, and then every day you start fresh. So that's how I thought it should have been the first year as well. 

 Q. I know that your systems are highly different, but in terms of maybe what fans can enjoy, how would you say the LPGA's system stacks up to what's going on this week with the Tour Championship on the PGA TOUR? 
 CRISTIE KERR: Well, I think ours is different. You know, it is a true playoff tournament where you have 32 people, and everybody's eliminated up until the last day. 
 So I think it adds to a lot of drama. You know, having eight people and not knowing what's going to happen. 
 With the men's Tour Championship, it's a four-day tournament where you have, you know, like a normal tournament where all the scores count every day. So in that sense you never know who is going to win. It adds to a lot of drama and pretty good TV ratings for us. 

 Q. I know that you were down going to the Miami-Dade Sports Hall of Fame last week. I was at the Ryder Cup so I didn't have a chance to attend. But can you talk to me about how all that went? 
 CRISTIE KERR: The induction in Miami was terrific. John Offerdahl. I can't remember the name of the other couple of people. One was the executive of the racetrack and another one was Cookie. 
 It was a great honor. I was glad I could make it down there. It had been a couple of years in the making trying to make it happen. I was glad I could finally make it down there. 
 It's good to be honored from the city in which you grew up in. We've had a lot of great sports stars come out of Miami, so it was a good honor for me, for sure. 

 Q. Is there anybody else not necessarily on this year's induction list but in the Hall of Fame itself that you are particularly proud of standing alongside now? 
 CRISTIE KERR: Definitely, Matt Moore was in the room. I'm trying to think who else was in the room. I was fairly sick at the time and on antibiotics. So forgive me if I forget who exactly was there. 
 I was happy to be around my friends and family that I never get to see. So I was kind of very involved in that for the hour and a half, two hours of the lunch.
