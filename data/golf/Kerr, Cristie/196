   CRISTIE KERR: I didn't play very well. Just didn't have it. I hit it pretty bad the last two days. I actually did okay on the first two days, but I hit it really, really bad on Saturday and Sunday.  
  
  Q. So much was made before the tournament about how difficult this golf course would play. It ended up playing tougher than you thought? Easier than you thought?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Um, I played terrible. You know, I think it probably played easier than we thought because it softened up for the weekend.  
 But, you know, Paula's playing great. Kudos to her.  
  
  Q. And if she holds on and wins, how do you think that'll be received?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Oh, I think it will be a very popular win. I mean, it's great to see another American win. I think we can all finally stop answering, When are the Americans going to come up to the challenge, because of winning the last two majors is pretty impressive.  
  
  Q. So it's just one of those things you just couldn't get going? I mean, you'd make a good hole and then have a bad one.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, that happened to me all week. Just didn't -- just didn't hit it good. You know, I chunked the 3-wood yesterday. I topped the 3-wood today, like, pretty much.   
 So just something going a little haywire in my swing. I'll work it out with my coach, and I'll be ready to go when I go overseas.  
  
  Q. Were there any hole that really gave you a hard time this week?  
 CRISTIE KERR: All of them. You know, even hitting good shots, I just ended up making mistakes. I just didn't play well.  
  
  Q. Was it more how you played?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, the course didn't -- I mean, to me, I didn't think the course played that tough on the weekend. I just played -- I just -- I hit it really, really bad.
