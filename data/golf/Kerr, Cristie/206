 Q. Give us your summary of today? 
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I played great. I was playing great, and you know, I know better to miss it left on 17. I was fortunate to actually get a shot at the green because I was standing in fire ants. I didn't even think getting a drop I would be able to hit to the green, but I had a shot.
 Actually hit a great shot and just ended up in a really bad spot. But I should have hit 3-wood on 1. I was kind of feeling it, but I figured well if I keep it right, and I hit it in the worst spot you can hit it. 
 You know, in contention, beginning of the year; I've got to take that away. I had a good time with my caddie out there. It's a disappointing finish but I still have to keep my head high.

 Q. To finish up there has to give you confidence?
 CRISTIE KERR: For sure, I played my heart out today. 17 was tough, but you know, I kind of just kept the bad momentum going and just kind of made a bad decision. I just should have just hit 3-wood off 18 tee, but I was fortunate to make bogey. I made a great bogey putt. You live and learn I guess.

 Q. Your overall thoughts on the week; coming into the start of the week you said it's one of the top tournaments on the calendar. 
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, for sure, I always enjoy this tournament. HSBC puts on a great event. They put us up at the Fairmont and we get to drive BMWs all week. It's not too shabby. It was a pretty good week for me.
