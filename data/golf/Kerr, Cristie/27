 Q.  This place seems to treat you well.  What is it about coming back here?  
CRISTIE KERR: I like this golf course.  I think it's a tough golf course and you can't fall asleep on any shot.  I mean, it's just a really great course.  The layout.  The rough is high.  You got to pay attention.  I think that's maybe why I play a little better here than some other places.   
 Q.  Is this the kind of start you were looking for this year in a tournament?  
CRISTIE KERR: For this week you mean?  Or overall?   
 Q.  Yeah, just like to start a tournament.  This was your best round.  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, today was a great round.  I felt like I hit a little better today than I have the last few weeks.   
Working on the right stuff now, so I'm excited.   
 Q.  Anything particular you're working on?  
CRISTIE KERR: Just working on making my swing shorter and getting the stroke down a little bit more shallow.  When I do that I usually hit it pretty good.   
 Q.  Good mojo playing with some Solheim Cup partners today?  
CRISTIE KERR: Absolutely.  We had a lot of fun out there.  We all made a lot of birdies, so it was nice.  We got a little behind in the pace, but it was fine.  We caught up.
