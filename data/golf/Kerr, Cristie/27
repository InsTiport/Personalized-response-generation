Q. A 5-under 67 today in Singapore.  Just rolled in there for you at 18.  What was that feeling to see that drop in?
CRISTIE KERR: Felt great.  Didn't have a great lie on that chip and just opted to putt it.  Sometimes it can be tricky with the speed, so I was glad to make a par putt.
Q. It's brutally hot here and it was brutally hot last week.  You played so well especially last year in Malaysia where you got your big win.  What is it about the Asia Swings recently that seems to be bringing out the best in you?
CRISTIE KERR: I just love playing in Singapore and these stretches of golf, Sime Darby, Thailand, even Australia.  I like playing in different places and experiencing the cultures, and the golf courses are really good over here, so it's fun to play.
