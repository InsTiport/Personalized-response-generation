Q.   Just sum up this week the best you can. 
CRISTIE KERR:   I don't know.   No, I did the best I could.   Today was brutal with the weather.   You know what?   I played well enough to get to 10 and just didn't putt one up.   Just couldn't steady myself in the wind and get my putts online today, and it's just hard.   It's a lot harder to do that. 
Just glad the week is over.   I'm happy we got an official tournament in for the sponsor.   I think they deserved it.   It's kind of weird playing the 18th hole for the first time all week after I saw it on Monday.   I didn't play it exactly right, but I managed to squeak out a par.

Q.   Are you leaving here frustrated, feeling good about your game, what is your takeaway? 
CRISTIE KERR:   Oh, I think I'm leaving feeling good about my game.   I was in contention again today.   I wish I could have had two more days, which I think a lot of people right now wish they could have had two more days.   But it was just we got really kind of unlucky with the weather on the 18th hole.   It started pouring on my tee shot, and I hit a bad tee shot, and layâ€‘up, and tough wedge shot which I didn't execute well, and I managed to grind out a par.   I've got to be happy with that.   I finished T4, I believe. 
Just happy the week is over, and hopefully we can come back and play the golf course next year because it's a solid, really great golf course.
