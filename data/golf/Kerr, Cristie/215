 Q. Cristie, you were in position to be an anchor match, but when did you find out that that wasn't going to happen and the Cup was retained ahead of you?
 CRISTIE KERR: You could kind of sense it when you were out there, but I wish I would have finished a little better. I know that we won it, when I saw Christina running across the green at the last minute. 
 I hit it way right and had a bad lie or whatever. Doesn't matter. We won.

 Q. What does a week like this, a player like you, the LPGA and women's golf is really in your hands and all your fellow teammates this week moving forward. What does this week mean in the whole perspective of that in the Solheim Cup?
 CRISTIE KERR: Sure. I think Solheim Cup is one of the most important weeks of the year, if not the most important. Just look at all the people out here. It's such high visibility and such great spirit. It's an amazing event and I'm happy to be a part of it. 

 Q. Thank you, Cristie, and congratulations to the U.S. team.
