   JASON TAYLOR: Cristie, thanks for coming in. Great round today, 66, 9-under overall, currently a three-shot lead. If you would, just talk about your day.   
 CRISTIE KERR: I played great. You know, both days I started out with a birdie, yesterday and today. I felt like even though there's the extremely tough conditions, I've really managed to control my ball well in the wind.   
 I had a lot of birdie opportunities, and I've been putting well, so I also had about a 7-footer on No. 8, which was my 17th hole. I hit an unbelievable shot to that backhand and it lept out. The wind actually kind of kept the ball out of the hole.   
 All in all I've been playing great. I'm really enjoying myself. My caddy and I, John Klinger, are really having a lot of fun out there, not putting too much pressure on myself and just trying to execute well.  
 JASON TAYLOR: Great. Questions for Cristie.   
  
  Q. Yeah. Cristie, how big a factor, I mean the winds swirling, everyone's talking about you really can't get a feel for each hole, how it'll change. How does that affect your game in particular and just trying to keep that calmness about you?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I felt very calm over the last couple weeks and especially in the winds the last two days. Not trying too hard.   
 I grew up in the wind in Miami, and I was very comfortable out there in the wind, and you know, just tried to figure out what it was doing and just kind of play to that instead of fighting the wind.   
 So again, I was very comfortable and I was able to control the ball in the wind.  
  
  Q. When you come off a wind I would think you're ready to go right back out, but it doesn't seem obviously that the two weeks has affected you in any way. Can you just talk about how you're playing right now coming in, even with the break in between?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I've been playing great. I've put a lot of work into my game, on both sides, physical and mental. I've worked on my short game probably more than anything this year, and when you start hitting it good and your short game and putting it you start doing go what I've done the last couple weeks.   
 So it was nice to have a couple weeks off and be able to go home. I haven't been home in a while, get some stuff done, and I really look forward to coming out and playing this week.  
  
  Q. You birdied three of the four par 5s on the course. What was the key on the long hole there? Was it the driving or the second and third shots?  
 CRISTIE KERR: No. I think it's position, really knowing what the wind's going to do up at the green and laying up according to good yardage for the conditions. You know, I hit on the green in two on No. 4. I almost made eagle there.   
 You know, just again, just really have been controlling my ball around the golf course, you know, probably as good as I ever have the last couple weeks, and it's a lot of fun.  
  
  Q. So what you're saying is it could have been even better, almost had a hole-in-one, almost had an eagle?  
 CRISTIE KERR: It could always be better. That's golf for you. But it couldn't get much better really for me the last couple days.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Thanks, Cristie.
