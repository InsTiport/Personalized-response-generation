 Q. Not a terrible score out here. 
 CRISTIE KERR: No, it's a very good score. It's very tricky around the greens. We all hit good shots into some of the greens and you just get some really bad bounces. Even the last hole, I took an aggressive play off the tee to get it down there to get a short club in, and I hit a great shot into the green, landed five yards short of the pin and it goes all the way back. 
 It's just really tricky what they have done with the greens here, but you have to be patient, and you know, I made one bad swing and got kind of unlucky on nine, and I was good, I didn't let it bother me. You know, I knew that if I got in the red today, it would be a good start. 

 Q. Is this just one of those places where you kind of know ahead of time that at some point, you are going to get a bad bounce, maybe a couple? 
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, that's exactly what I just said. You're just going to hit some good shots that don't get rewarded, and you just hope the bad spots, you try to get up-and-down. 

 Q. Did conditions change much?
 CRISTIE KERR: I thought they got a little bit more benign. We started out and it was really, really windy, and it died down and got warmer for us. 
 I don't know if they are going to be able to finish the round today, but I think we ended up getting a good part of the draw, if we end up a little delayed in the morning, it will be a little warmer, so that's good.

 Q. The flipside is you do have 7:00 am tomorrow. 
 CRISTIE KERR: We are 8:00 or something.
