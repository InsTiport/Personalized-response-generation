 Q.  Great shot.  
CRISTIE KERR: Thank you.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the lead up?  
CRISTIE KERR: My God, I played so bad today and that was like -- I don't know.  I was trying to just make as many birdies as I could coming in.  Finally got a birdie on 10 and 13, and just was trying to somehow bring it back close to par and get out in the morning and have some better greens.   
Made it.  It was just incredible, because Eun Hee, last year she won the tournament but also made a hole-in-one on that hole.  The odds of the two of us playing in the same group and her having won it and then me doing it, that was pretty cool.   
 Q.  Who knows.  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, that's why I pointed at her when I made it, because she's like -- she pointed at me first and I pointed at her or I pointed at her and then she pointed at me.  It was cool, yeah.  Yeah.   
 Q.  9-iron?  
CRISTIE KERR: 9-iron.  Yeah, 9-iron.  I think it was 143 yards straight downwind.   
 Q.  How did you feel like you were hitting it today.  I didn't hit it good at all.  I don't know, I don't feel right like adrenaline-wise today.  Sometimes that happens.  Just going to go relax the rest of the night, talk to my coach, and get up back in the morning early.
