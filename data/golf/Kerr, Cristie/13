Q. Bogey-free, 6 birdies.
CRISTIE KERR: Uh-huh.
Q. What was working out there for you?
CRISTIE KERR: I got off to a hot start and made a couple good saves middle of the round.  Got a good break on the 7th hole; thought it was going to be in the trees.  My second shot ended up right near the green and made birdie, so kind of kept the momentum going.
Then birdied 9, so shot 4-under on the front.  Made a great birdie on 10.  Didn't hit it as good on the back nine, but I scrambled when I needed to and just kept the momentum going.
Then made a very good birdie on 14 and some good saves coming in, so just played solid even though I didn't quite strike it the way I wanted on the back.  Mentally I thought the last two days was as good as I've been in a year, so that's really satisfying.
Q. Feel good about your game at this point in the season?  Still beginning.
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah.  You know, I feel there is a lot of work to be done still, but I feel like keep the mental group game like I feel like I'll see the strides in my game.
