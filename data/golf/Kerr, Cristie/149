 Q. You must be disappointed? 
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, definitely. We tried to apply the pressure on the last hole and hit it on the green. I actually hit a good shot, but it went to the back bunker. 
 I was trying to fly 8, 10 yards short of the hole and kind of let it come in there. I don't know. I guess the momentum got the better of me there. Paula hit a great bunker shot, so... 

 Q. Paula, I know the Europeans holed three monster putts in a row against you guys, but you managed to come back strong on 13. 
 PAULA CREAMER: Yeah, we could have easily been 3-up there. We had the birdie on 10, and a good look at birdie on 11 and then the bomb on 12, but she made that good putt. 
 But that's match play. That's what it is out here. A halve is a halve. It is unfortunate, but we were a good team grinding it out. It's always fun playing with Kerr, and they played well.

 Q. I don't suppose you think of it from our point of view, but it was really exciting for us. 
 PAULA CREAMER: Well, I'm glad it was great for TV. But we're trying to represent our country well and get out there and grind it out as much as we can and be a team.
