 Q. Awesome playing this game. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  It was awesome.  We played well for 16 holes and played well at different times, and so it was a good day. 

 Q.  You are a Solheim Cup rookie.  What was it like? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Of course I was a little nervous, but we did a good job.  Cristie is a great partner.  She's been out here many times.  We really relied on each other and played great. 

 Q.  What did you say about this game so far? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  I think it was terrific.  I told Sophie walking on the first tee, "What a way for the rookie to start the match in the pouring rain and cold and wind.  It's part of Solheim.  You take it all in." 
 I told Nicole, "Once you hit the first tee shot, you're not a rookie anymore." 

 Q.  Have you been surprised with all the red on the scoreboard? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  We're not surprised. 

 Q. Okay.
