  Q. Let's go over your birdies.   
 CRISTIE KERR: I birdied No. 1. It was playing into the wind, so I had about a 50-yard pitch and pitched it up there to about ten feet and made that. I hit 5-wood to about five feet on the second hole and made that for eagle.   
 Sand wedge to about six feet on 3 and made that for birdie.   
 On 6, I actually hit like a punch 4-iron up there about five feet beyond the hole, which you don't want to be above the hole no matter where you are, and I made that for birdie.   
 Hit kind of in the gorse stuff on 7 and I believe the wind was right-to-left and I kind of blocked it so I had to chip out. I got it up on the green and just 2-putted with a tap-in from about 40 feet.   
 9, I hit lob-wedge to about eight feet and made that.   
 10th hole, I hit 5-wood on the green and 2-putted from about 35 feet and made about a five-foot second putt.   
 Birdied No. 11, hit sand wedge to about an inch, and then I parred in from there.   
  
  Q. You started off really well.   
 CRISTIE KERR: I started off great which is what you need to do on this golf course. This course you have to play the tough holes well and you have to take advantage of the holes you know you should take advantage of.   
  
  Q. And the conditions, how was the wind?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Conditions were a lot different today. My round today, it's probably going to be the low round of the day. I don't know if anybody else has gone real, real low. But to shoot 2-, 3-, 4-under today was great, and I shot 7, so I was very happy with the way I played today.  
  
  Q. How did you feel coming into the week?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I feel pretty good. I've made a lot of progress on my game. My swing and my short game were not where I wanted it to be last year and I've put a lot of work in and I'm just starting to see the benefits and that's how long it takes sometimes.
