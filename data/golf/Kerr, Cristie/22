Q. That was one jam-packed leaderboard today.  How much were you keeping an eye on it?  When you birdied 16 you were within one shot of the lead at that point.
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I kind of looked towards the end.  Didn't really matter.  Kind of messed up the 17th hole.
I played really well today.
Q. You must be proud of the way you bounced back from a disappointing day yesterday.
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, for sure.
Q. Were you aware of that ace?
CRISTIE KERR: No, no.  I don't think we could hear it, right?  Yeah, I didn't hear anything.
But, I mean, if you make an ace in the final round when you're leading or tied for the lead, you're going to win a golf tournament.
Q. What do you take away from this week and what are your thoughts heading into Rancho Mirage?
CRISTIE KERR: I'm proud of the way I bounced back.  I've still got some work to do on my game.  This year I've just had that one round that's kind of escaped me, gotten away a little bit.
Put four solid rounds together, I'll be there.
