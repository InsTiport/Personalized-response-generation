Q.   We're here with Cristie Kerr after round 2.   The wind kind of picked up here in the afternoon.   How did that factor into play?
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, it definitely made the approach shots more tricky, and you just had to stay more patient because you're not quite hitting it as close to the hole.   It kind of died down towards the end of the round and we got some more opportunities.   I played really well today, felt great, felt a little more rested, and I'm ready to go for the weekend.

Q.   What is your approach going into tonight, headed into tomorrow?   What changes? 
CRISTIE KERR:   Nothing changes.   I think I'm going to just try to play each shot just a little bit better than these first two days, just mentally being there, just to be ready to hit each shot and not let anything bother me.   If I do that for the weekend, if I take care of my job, everything will work out.

Q.   You had a great reaction on 15.   Can you take us through that hole?   What was your thought process? 
CRISTIE KERR:   Oh, it was just a good 9â€‘iron and I had to get all of it to get it to the hole, and Mark and I were like, nothing extra, just a good swing, and I hit it great, and it was just on a really good line, and when it hit the green and released a little bit, we couldn't tell whether it was short or long, and then you could just see it hit a ton of the hole.   We holed that last week, and I don't know, I'll look forward to more opportunities, I guess, on the weekend.
