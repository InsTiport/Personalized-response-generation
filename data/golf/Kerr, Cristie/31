 Q.  6-under 65 following up yesterday's 63.  What's gotten into you the last two days?  You're on fire.  
CRISTIE KERR: Well, I definitely hit it better, and when I give my putter chances, usually I do okay with that.  So it's been fun the last couple days.   
 Q.  You're always known for the putting, walking the putting in.  When your putter gets on fire, what does it feel like?  Do you know it when it's clicking in for you?  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, you can definitely feel what you need to do.  I'm very entrenched in what I need to do is as far as hitting it the speed and starting it on line.  God's blessed me with this gift.  I'm not going to second guess it.   
 Q.  Speaking of blessings, we're here on Pink Saturday, and you do so much with your Birdies for Breast Cancer Foundation and everything you do.  What does it mean to you to play in an event that does so much to give back?  
CRISTIE KERR: This tournament is such a beacon for women's health.  I was saying over there before, the average size of a tumor in America is the size of your pinky nail.  Here it's the size of a fist.  So getting the message out into the community that early detection is the key is really huge.  So this is a beacon for women's health, this tournament.   
 Q.  We're glad to have you back and excited to have you in the lead.  How do you get yourself ready for one last final round out here in the heat and humidity?  
CRISTIE KERR: I'm just going to enjoy it.  I'm really blessed.  I'm just going to try to not put too much pressure on myself.  I didn't hit it great coming in on the back but I didn't stress about it.  I just tried to do the best I could.  That's where I play my best golf from; I try to do the best on every shot, so that's my mantra tomorrow.
