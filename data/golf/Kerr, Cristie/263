  Q.  Kind of a difficult day for you today.  Anything in particular that didn't go right?   
 CRISTIE KERR:  I didn't hit it good today, and my putting was continued.  It's funny because I hit a lot -- the putts that I did hit good putts didn't go in or they'd lip out or something.  It would have been funny if I just chucked my putter in the lake after the end of the round because I'm not using it again (laughter).   
  
  Q.  A lot of the ladies have been having trouble with these greens.  Is it just the greens?   
 CRISTIE KERR:  No, it's been me.  I haven't been putting well in the last month, and since the U.S. Open, I putted great, I was reading the greens well there, speed was great, I had made a lot of long putts there, just haven't been putting well.   
  
  Q.  Tough to defend obviously?   
 CRISTIE KERR:  Well, playing like this, yeah.  You're not going to defend any golf tournament playing the way I did.   
  
  Q.  How did the golf course set up this week?   
 CRISTIE KERR:  I think it set up very fair, not kind of overly tough but not easy.  The rain yesterday made the course play a little bit longer today, so the scores shouldn't be quite as low today.
