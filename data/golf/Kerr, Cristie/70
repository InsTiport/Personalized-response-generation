Q. Even par today?
CRISTIE KERR: Yes.
Q. Rate your performance for us.
CRISTIE KERR: I thought I played great this week.  I had a couple points in a couple of rounds where the momentum could have turned the other way, and it could have been definitely four to six shots better for the week.  But very pleased with my performance.  I made a lot of putts this week, and made some key up-and-downs and just never got down on myself.
Q. Did you like the golf course?
CRISTIE KERR: I liked the golf course, yeah, I definitely think it played like an Open course the last three days.  This course clearly needs some wind.  It played very easy the first day.  But I think you've seen now, 6-under is leading, and that's about what should win an Open.
Q. The putting success, is that something that you've been working on to try to stabilize?
CRISTIE KERR: No, putting has always been my favorite part of the game.  It definitely saved me a bunch this week, even though the momentum to try to win the tournament wasn't there, to finish in the top-10 or whatever I ended up finishing, I kept that going.
