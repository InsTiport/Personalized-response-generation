Q. Bit windy to start.  You said you're accustomed to this a little bit or you know how to handle it.  How was it out there today?
CRISTIE KERR: Pretty windy, especially on the greens.
Q. How does that effect the way you sort of handle that?
CRISTIE KERR: You have to read different breaks sometimes.  (Wind interference.)  Just have to kind of feel it out and judge it.  I had a good ending to the day.
Q. (Indiscernible - wind.)  Do you guys push each other?  How do you feel like that pairing worked out for you guys today?
CRISTIE KERR: It was a nice pairing, but, I mean, especially when it's this windy you're just trying to do your own thing and trying to survive and trying to get the ball close to the hole and make the putt.
Q. How does today - it's pretty blustery - compare to your past years?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah.
Q. (Indiscernible - wind.)
CRISTIE KERR: I think this is kind of average wind for here.  I've played more rounds in this wind here than I have in calm conditions.  Last year was abnormally calm.  Played a little bit like this on Sunday -- Saturday rather since the tournament ends on Saturday.
Usually it's like this.
Q. (Regarding last year.)
CRISTIE KERR: I don't know.
Q. (Indiscernible - wind.)
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, you know, I feel like I played better this first round than last year.  I think I shot even on or 1-over to start the tournament last year.
So go work on the game a little bit and get back out there tomorrow.
Q. (Indiscernible - wind.)
CRISTIE KERR: More determination.  More determination.  I was a little wishy washy on my (indiscernible - wind.)  Clubs and hit some bad shots.
Just mentally hanging in there.  No, we're not the doing that.  Just hit it where we're looking.  We're going to get it close to the hole.
I had a lot of opportunities I could've made on the second nine.  Could have been 3- or 4-under, so...
Q. (Indiscernible - wind.)
CRISTIE KERR: Yep, yep.
