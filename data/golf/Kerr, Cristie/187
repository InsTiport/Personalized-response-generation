   CRISTIE KERR: Her rank, her points average is going down, so who knows what would have happened had she stayed in. It's been crazy and it's been fun. It's been kind of like a roller coaster ride. I've been very close to regaining number one the last couple weeks. And you know, got a couple more weeks to do it.  
  
  Q. You had a real good first 50 holes last week. What happened? Have you been able to figure it out?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Well, I mean, I'm human. It's golf. I've played amazing golf for the first 50, actually, more than that, more like over 50 holes. I just kind of hit a streak where the putter went cold, and it magnifies your mistakes. Hit a couple bad shots, nothing went in, and those kind of add up in the wrong direction, so, it's golf.  
  
  Q. How good is this for the LPGA Tour to have it wide open? To have the changes that have been up at the top spot, the three of you guys going back and forth. How good is it for the Tour?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I think it's amazing. The more we can get the word out that the LPGA is exciting and there is something to watch, there is an American, obviously, me, up there in the mix to be number one in the world, I think that we'll get a lot more fans, a lot more people interested. It's a good time for us.  
  
  Q. How much pressure comes with that, being in that spot or in that position to get that number one ranking?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I think it's a good kind of pressure. I don't think it's a bad kind of pressure. It's an opportunity. It's been a long time since Americans had the ability to end the year number one. So I think that you've just got to go for it. There's nothing to lose.  
  
  Q. Do you think it's important to have an American back on top?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I think it is.  
  
  Q. Whether it's you or anybody else.   
 CRISTIE KERR: We already have such an international membership and international fan base. I think we need to grow our fan base in the United States again, so that we can grow and have more opportunities and more sponsors here.   
When I first came out on TOUR, we had over 40 tournaments, now we have 26. That's quite a change in ten years or something.  
  
  Q. When is the last time you played here?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Played in the United States?   
  
  Q. No in this tournament?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Oh, like two years ago. I think I only missed one or two years.  
  
  Q. You won it in 2002?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, that was my first tour win at Twelve Bridges.  
  
  Q. What do you remember about that?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I mean, it was amazing to get my first win. It was the end of a long kind of drought, because it took me six years to win. And I had finished second a lot before then, and it was like a level that I reached. You know, the first mini level on many levels of my career.  
  
  Q. Because it took you six years to get that first win, was it easy? I mean, I look and know in other sports a rookie gets into the playoffs and thinks it's going to happen every year. It's a shock when they don't.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Because it took you so long, was it easier to go to the next one?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I think the second one was just as hard, frankly. The following year I didn't win a tournament, and then I won three. Once I got the second win, it was like okay, I'm a multiple Tour winner now. I can keep doing this. I have to keep working hard and do all the right things.   
But first and second win were -- I think the first one was amazing, but since I went a while before I got my second win, it was kind of like the first one all over again.  
  
  Q. What was the LPGA win like for you this year?   
 CRISTIE KERR: A dream performance. I feel like I could have easily won by six or seven last week. I just didn't have a good Sunday. I had three weeks off where I was in the middle of running and opening our women's health center in Jersey, running our event, moving, doing a bunch of stuff. I really only got to practice three or four days before last week.   
 So I think that I was even in that position was amazing. It's a testament to the kind of talent I have. But I think when you haven't played for a while, Sunday is a different -- Sunday is a different thing. You need to be sharp. You need to be ready.   
I think that not having played for three weeks -- the first kind of three days were easy, and Sunday is when you bear down and try to get it done. I was a little rusty in that respect.
