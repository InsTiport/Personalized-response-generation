 Q.   All right.   I'm joined here now by Cristie Kerr, just turned in her second consecutive 68 at the Kia Classic.   Just two shots off the lead.   Cristie, great round.   I know you said you were going to work on some things last night after your round with your coach Bryan here this week.   What transitioned?   Obviously something worked out there.  
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah.   I hit it pretty well.   You know, there were a couple of loose shots.   I missed a couple of putts out there, so it was a great round, but not perfect by any stretch, so there's always room for improvement.   So I'm just going to do a little practice after the round and just get rested up for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Course conditions, I know yesterday everybody said afternoon was maybe at a little bit more of a disadvantage.   How much were you looking forward to taking advantage of the morning wave today?  
CRISTIE KERR:   I actually thought yesterday afternoon was okay.   There were a couple of bumpy spots on the greens, but that's going to happen on poa annua greens.   
Yeah, the conditions were great this morning.   The wind's starting to come up now, so it was nice to get in a morning round.  
   
 Q.   Eagle on one right after the turn.   A little bit of a momentum booster?   How did that fit into your round today?  
CRISTIE KERR:   It definitely was.   I shot even on the front and kind of left a couple out there.   And that was just a great shot.   Couldn't see it go in, unfortunately, but it was a great 7â€‘iron, perfect club, and I just said get close, and it went in.   So it was cool.  
   
 Q.   Baby Mason, the newest member out here on tour.   He's out here this week in San Diego area.   Talk about just the best thing so far to have him out here on tour and probably take your mind away off the game a little bit.  
CRISTIE KERR:   You know what, he's amazing and it's also a great distraction because when you get off the golf course, you're not thinking about golf.   You're thinking about him and taking care of him and having fun with him.   So it's been a blast having him out.  
   
 Q.   Thanks for joining us.   Best of luck.
