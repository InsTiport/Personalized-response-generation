Q. Cristie Kerr, the 2015 champ.  Couple weeks ago you were in very serious golf cart accident.  You tough out a tie for 23rd at the U.S. Open; bogey free today.  How are you doing what you're doing?
CRISTIE KERR:   I actually feel a little bit better today, but I just thought it was really important to get through last week.  There were points where I didn't think that I was going to be able to, but I guess when they say there is a will there is a way.
Q. You described the pain last week as a six on a scale of one to ten.  You've done some kryo and some physical therapy.  How would you describe the pain this week?
CRISTIE KERR:   It was like a two to three today, so it was a little bit better.  Honestly, Sunday last week when we played the one hole it was like nine.  Like I got very lucky to not play that day and to go get treatment and come back out the next day and finish the round, to be able to finish.
It was pretty bad.  Of there were points last week where I didn't think I was going to be able to finish.  Since coming here and getting therapy and doing more kryotherapy, I definitely felt -- in the pro-am as the day went on it got a little bit worse and I saved myself a few holes there, but today of the best I've felt in two weeks.
Q. And now you're in the thick of this golf tournament.  It's a place you're very comfortable.  You won five years ago.  What's on your mind as you look ahead to the final three days?
CRISTIE KERR:   Well, I need to hit it a little bit better.  I know I scored well today.  I got up and down a lot, chipped in for par once.  But I need to hit it better and keep putting and chipping the way that I'm doing.
