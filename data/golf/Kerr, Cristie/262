  Q.  Cristie, just talk about the course.   
 CRISTIE KERR:  I couldn't tell you about the golf course.  I haven't played it yet.  Today being Wednesday with the Pro-Am tomorrow, the first opportunity I will get to the course, I will probably play early morning tomorrow morning before the Pro-Am.   
  
  Q.  When you come to a new place like NW Arkansas, the first ever tournament here, and try to figure things out early in the tournament?   
 CRISTIE KERR:  Absolutely.  It's a great area, everybody is so nice, and we love the hotel and practice facilities here at the golf course is great, so I look forward to the week.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the stretch doing well in a tournament here in NW Arkansas.    
 CRISTIE KERR:  The last part of the season is very important for me.  I have a lot at stake.  I'm working really hard on my game.  This would be a great place to start a little run towards the end of the season for me.   
  
  Q.  What would you tell Stacy Lewis coming out here and playing in her hometown tournament for the first time?   
 CRISTIE KERR:  Just not to put too much pressure on herself and to enjoy it and just try to play the best she can.   
  
  Q.  Looking forward to the Solheim Cup.  You are one of the younger players.  You find yourself able to be in a unique leadership position, in that you're connected to the entire team and you'll instill your leadership and be able to lead them to the Solheim Cup?   
 CRISTIE KERR:  Absolutely.  I am kind of like one of the younger, but more veteran players on the team, and this will be my fourth Solheim Cup.  So I have a lot of ways to relate to the younger players, as well as maybe give them advice, so it's going to be quite a week.
