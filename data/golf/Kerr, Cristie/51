CRISTIE KERR: Wow, I don't know what to say.  It's been an epic day.  It didn't start out so hot, but I knew if I just hung in there and made a couple birdies I would get it going, and the back nine was magic for me this week.
Feels awesome.
Q. Was it a feeling of staying patient?  You were five back with 15 holes to play.  (Indiscernible.)
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I tried not to really think about anybody but myself.  You know, I battled through so much this off-season, and this just feels is good.
