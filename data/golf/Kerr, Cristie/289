Q.  Natalie and Cristie, Laura Davies equated the Solheim Cup competition to the last 9 holes of a major championship.

NATALIE GULBIS:  I wasn't really nervous.  I did change my tempo a little bit.  I certainly learned a lot, and I'm ready to cheer on my teammates and the rest of the afternoon.

CRISTIE KERR:  We tried to get the momentum back and we just couldn't, and we thought we could take advantage of some great shots.

We had a lot of fun and looking forward to the afternoon, and when we get the opportunities, we're going to take advantage of them.  We had fun and learned a lot and we're going to cheer on our teammates.
