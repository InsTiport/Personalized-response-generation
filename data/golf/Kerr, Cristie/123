 Q.   You guys were awfully quiet here in the aftermath of defeat.   What was the difference in your rounds today?   
PAULA CREAMER:   We just didn't make a putt.   Started off hitting the ball well, it's one of those things with this golf course.   
Once you start seeing some putts go in, you can make some birdies out there.   But we had so many lipouts and it's just, that's the way it was.   It's very unfortunate, we grinded it the last several holes, we're a great team, and we went up against a good team as well.   And I think she's going to look for some revenge this afternoon.  
   
 Q.   You guys were undefeated up to this point as partners, you hit some great putts today that didn't go in.   Is it one of those things where you start pressing after awhile?   
CRISTIE KERR:   Just didn't seem to get any momentum right off the bat.   I just couldn't seem to get any of them to drop.   And then missed a couple greens, and they seemed to throw three really long bombs at us on 8, 9 and 10, and we really didn't get the momentum until our last couple holes and then it's too late.   So you got to get a good start in foursomes.   
   
 Q.   Just seemed like Korda, one of the rookies, kind of stepped up and played well this afternoon.   How big is that?   
PAULA CREAMER:   Everybody has their role out here of the we're all here for a reason.   As a rookie, your first match out is always a great experience and she's going to feel a lot more confident going into tomorrow and comfortable.   And it's awesome to see a point up on the board.
