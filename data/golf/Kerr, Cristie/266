   MIKE SCANLAN:  Cristie, thanks for coming in and dodging the rain.  First of all, congratulations again on your U.S. Open victory.  Can you just talk a little about what it's like to be here in New York, especially as the raining champion of the U.S. Open. 
 CRISTIE KERR:  It terrific.  New York is one of my most favorite places to visit, and I've lived here -- we have a house in Arizona now, but we've had a place in New York for the last three years and kind of rented it out to one of our relatives.  So, you know, it's an area I really like coming to and we're staying in Greenwich this week in friends and just glad to be here and just very excited.  The trophy is actually in the house I'm staying in, so that's fun. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  Have you had a chance to play the course yet? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  18 holes yesterday. 
 MIKE SCANLAN:  What was it like for you? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  It was in perfect shape.  I don't know, they rained out the Pro-Am this morning which I wasn't very surprised with; it was pouring where we were.  You know, I just hope that it holds off the rest of the day, because it was in such great shape yesterday.  I'm sure it's pretty wet out there right now. 

 Q.  When you go from a tournament like the Open, where every stroke counts, 72 holes is such an intense examination to consider where the format is obviously a lot different.  How much of an adjustment is that for you and for everyone else in the field in terms of adjusting to this format? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  It's just different.  We don't play a whole lot.  We play once a year, and obviously if you're in the Solheim Cup, you play a team event with match play, but it's just different.  It's a different mind-set.  You're playing, each hole is a contest and you've got to just try and win as many holes as possible. 
 So with that being said, you just try and focus on your own game as much as you can and not really let what the other person is doing really affect you. 

 Q.  Do you look at the results, not to say the winners themselves are flukey, but what happens in a particular match subject to chance? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  I don't really pay attention to that during the tournament.  That's the whole point to having the 64 (player) bracket and it's a very, very exciting tournament. 

 Q.  As far as preparation goes for playing in this kind of format, does anything different go into preparing coming up to the tournament? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  I don't think so.  Golf is golf.  You know, I prepared for this tournament the same way I prepare for the U.S. Open or for any other tournament.  I mean, I play my practice round.  I do a ton of short game and hit a lot of shots and work with my coach.  You know for the bigger tournaments by coach Brian Lebedevitch comes out.  But golf is golf.  If you view it as being that differently in your mind, maybe it is.  But for me golf is golf, so I've just got to tie to play my own game as best I can. 

 Q.  Did you have a place in New York City, suburbs? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  In the City, 85th and Third.  We had an apartment.  We sublet it out to a relative. 

 Q.  The other thing I wanted to ask you was in Sports Illustrated last week, Dottie wrote a piece which suggested you need to enjoy this Open Championship a little bit more, change your mind-set I guess, I'm paraphrasing.  Have you gotten a sense of what this Open Championship means to you, and did you read the piece and did you understand what she was saying? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  My husband actually read the piece, I believe.  I haven't seen that one as of yet, but I've read everything else. 
 Yeah, it is a different mind-set.  You're a major championship winner and it's something that I've worked for my whole life and wanted -- that's the tournament I wanted to win the most and to have it happen is a dream come true.  And you know, it's finally sunk in a couple of weeks later, and once it happens, for the first couple of days after, even I played Toledo last week and you have all of the players and caddies coming up to you that are your friends and congratulating you, everybody is congratulating you.  You kind of feel like you're on cloud nine. 
 I said to my caddie, Jason, "There's still a lot of golf left this year, and we still have a lot of goals we want to accomplish."  We've enjoyed it but we're right back on the horse, we're right back ready to get into contention again. 

 Q.  You mentioned your goals.  Do those goals now or did this he ever include being the No. 1 player in the game, and does that at all seem more attainable than the player who holds that spot right now has not had been a premiere player for five or six years like Annika was. 
 CRISTIE KERR:  Yeah, Lorena is very strong.  She's a good friend of mine and an incredible person.  You know, of course I want to try and attain that goal in my career at some point.  You know, it's a lot of hard work.  I just won my first major championship, which helps.  You know, there's a lot that goes into that, so I've just got to try and build on the success that I've had recently, and you know, see how well I can do at the end of the year and, you know, within the next couple of years, I'll probably have my best shot at it.  
 MIKE SCANLAN:  Cristie, thanks so much for coming in.  Good luck.
