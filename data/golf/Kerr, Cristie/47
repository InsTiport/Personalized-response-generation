 Q.  A solid round, 2-under par 70 today.  You are in great position heading into Championship Sunday.  The sun is out.  How about the change of golf course today?  
CRISTIE KERR: Definitely started to firm up.  There was a lot of tough pin placements out there.  I played really, really well.  I only made a few putts.  I certainly didn't make the more makeable ones today.  Hopefully that will change tomorrow.   
 Q.  It seems like you have been experiencing back spasms this week.  How were you feeling?  
CRISTIE KERR: I actually felt a lot better today.  Yesterday was awful.  On the third hole, I just didn't know whether I could keep going or not.  I battled through it and I feel a lot better today.  I knew I had to stick it out.   
 Q.  You know how to close the deal in this championship.  How do you prepare tonight and tomorrow morning for this?  
CRISTIE KERR: Just going to have a nice evening.  I'm close, but I don't need to worry about anything.  I need to go out and play well tomorrow for myself.  And if I get some of those putts to fall then it could be close.
