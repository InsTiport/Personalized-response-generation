Q. Not quite what you were looking four today.  Tell us what happened out there.
CRISTIE KERR: Mentally just wasn't quite as sharp; swing wasn't quite as sharp.  I mean, every putt I hit like bounced horribly.  Like a lot of putts didn't have a chance to go in the hole.  I don't know why it was different today on the greens.
The putting green actually felt firmer and smoother, but they were noticeably different a little bit out there.  It is what it is.  I mean, when the greens are like that you got to hit them closer and I just didn't have it today.
Made a bad swing on 15 and made double.  But, there is still Sunday.  Somebody else got to sleep with the lead.
Q. Is it hard to have a lead that large with still two rounds to go?
CRISTIE KERR: No.  I mean, I don't think that affected my play today.  I just didn't have it.  I've got to go work on my game a little bit.
Kind of been a little bit of the story this year, a little bit of inconsistency.  Just got to be grateful I'm only one back with a whole new Sunday.
