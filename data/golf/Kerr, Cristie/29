Q. Now 20-time LPGA winner, what does it feel like, an hour or so after your putt, has it finally sunk in yet?
CRISTIE KERR: Oh, it sunk in when it went in.  I'm speechless.  That's probably the longest putt I've ever made to win a golf tournament.  I was so determined all day.  Things were just not going my way.  When I hit good shots, I'd get in some bad spots.  You know, that's just the way it goes sometimes in golf, but I stuck it out.
Q. You had 36 feet for birdie and the win.  What was going through your mind as you stood over that putt?
CRISTIE KERR: Just hit a good putt.  Get it to the hole.  Try to make it.
When I hit it, I could just tell it was going in.  I could just tell it was going in.  It was the most amazing thing.  Like it was perfect speed; if it missed, it was going to be two feet by.  It was right in the center never even thought about missing.
Q. So now you got your 20th win at a tournament that is so closely tied in with raising funds for breast cancer awareness, clearly something dear to you.  Does that add a little extra sweetness to this victory?
CRISTIE KERR: It definitely does, and I'm going to be making a donation to the tournament charity.  I love what they are doing here.  Like I said many times this week, it's a beacon of hope for women's health here in Malaysia and in Asia.  The work they are doing, it's awesome.
