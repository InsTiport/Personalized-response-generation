 Q.  What's been the key for you?  What's been really working well for you?  
CRISTIE KERR: You know, I've really worked hard on my golf swing, all aspects of my game.  You know, kind of just tried to simplify things in my mindset.  I've played very well for a long time.  As you play professional golf for a period of time, you're going to have great years and not so great years, and it feels great to be playing again, playing well again.   
 Q.  When you come back to a place where you've won before, are there good feelings?  Is it a confidence boost to come back?  Do you feel better than going to a place where you've never played before?  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, there's always good vibes, yeah.  I've always loved this golf course.  It suits my eye.  You have to play well to win.  I like coming back here.   
 Q.  What are a couple things you need to particularly do well on this course?  
CRISTIE KERR: You know, the tough holes you've just got to make pars, and holes that are scorable, like you have a lot of shorter clubs and wedges into greens, you have to try to get those within make range, at least 10, 12 feet and in.   
 Q.  Lastly, any pressure?  A lot of times a low score wins here, and 54 holes, too.  Is it pressure to get off to a good start and make a lot of birdies early because you don't have the time that you do in a 72-hole event?  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, you definitely need to shoot a low score one day.  I feel like you need to do that to win a four-day, too, so it doesn't really change it that much.  It's just you have a little bit less time.
