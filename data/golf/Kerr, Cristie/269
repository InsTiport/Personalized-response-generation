 Q.  Cristie Kerr, 5-under out there through how many holes? 
 CRISTIE KERR:  13 holes. 

 Q.  You really turned it on.  What happened? 
  CRISTIE KERR: I haven't really been hitting it that great. I've been making a lot of putts and managed to hit a little bit better in the third round. Worked with my coach a little bit after the second round. Hit two bags of balls and in the hot weather and went home, took a shower and changed and came back and made a great save on the fifth or sixth hole and just kind of kept the momentum going. 

 Q.  Was it hard not to get excited after shooting 31 on the front nine? 
  CRISTIE KERR: Well, it's always exciting doing that. But it's been a very long day of golf. I'm looking forward to the rest tonight and I'm just trying to do the best I can and honestly not put any pressure on myself, I just got to worry about my own game out there. And I'm happier that I'm working on my swing and starting to hit it where I want to hit it. That's more exciting to me than the score. Because the score adds up. 

 Q.  Simple fix on the range between rounds? 
  CRISTIE KERR: Not really. Nothing was really that off. I just was kind of coming up and out of my posture and hitting it right. And I still did that. And I still did that in the round that I played today. I didn't hit it that great, but I got up-and-down to keep the momentum going and hit some good shots here and there and just strung it together. 

 Q.  You came into this tournament off a run of good tournaments lately.  Can you talk about your confidence coming in here and did you feel? 
  CRISTIE KERR: Definitely more confident. I have played better as of late and just working on my swing and really focusing on executing the shot at hand and not so much about results. 



 No, I mean winning The Open would be great, but I would be happier if I executed all my shots the way I wanted to, because the score is kind of irrelevant if you do the things you're trying to do.
