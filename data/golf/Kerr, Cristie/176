  CRISTIE KERR: 5-under for the day, 3-under for the tournament.  
  
  Q. So you had an eagle?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah. I played really well today. Hit the ball very solidly. Hit a lot of greens. Gave myself a lot of chances and I putted very well today. I felt much better today like with my health. I felt terrible yesterday.  
  
  Q. What were you feeling yesterday?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I had the stomach flu and I feel like it's pretty much out of my system right now. So must have been something I ate, I'm not sure, but I did good just to be able to play yesterday.  
  
  Q. And everything felt better today?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I played great in the Pro-Am. I shot 5-under in the Pro-Am. It's a shame that I had to feel the way did I yesterday but there's two more days.  
  
  Q. What about your game particularly was working?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Like I said before, everything is just clicking and played great.
