 Q. So you got off to a bad start and then the horn blows. 
     CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, that's about it.

 Q. You had gotten through No. 3?
     CRISTIE KERR: I was on 5 green. Hadn't hit on the tee on 5 yet. I hit it like five feet on 5. 
     Yeah, it was feeling good. You got to take these in stride. I've been out here 14 years now and have had my share of delays. Some people think they affect momentum; sometimes they can help. 
     So I just got to go keep doing what I'm doing. 

 Q. The cough and stuff, how are you today?
     CRISTIE KERR: I sound worse, but I feel better. It was kind of getting worse in my chest. It was kind of going into my ear last night. 
     I called my doctor and he prescribed me a Z-Pak. So I got on an antibiotic last night.

 Q. Regardless of whether you go out there this afternoon or come back tomorrow, obviously a lot different course. 
     CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, it's gonna be really soft. I mean, it was soft to begin with. You know, we're not gonna get any roll. 
     They didn't start the round today lift, clean, and place, so we're not gonna be able to do that out there.

 Q. True. You're in a very good position, but just kind of depending on when it resumes, right?
     CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I'll be all right. I'm not worried.

 Q. You've done this a few times?
     CRISTIE KERR: Yeah.

 Q. What's the toughest thing to adjust to, I guess from... 
     CRISTIE KERR: A delay? 

 Q. Yeah, from this delay, especially when it's possibly a...
     CRISTIE KERR: You just got to keep moving. You know, I went to the fitness trailer and did my stretching routine again, did some cardio on the bike. Just keep the blood flowing. You don't want to sit around for four hours.
