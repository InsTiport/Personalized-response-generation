Q. Saved the best round for last.
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah.
Q. How was it out there?
CRISTIE KERR: I played awesome today.  Hit it great.  Hit a couple bad shots mid-round and figured out what it was and made some more birdies coming in.
Barely didn't hit that last one hard enough.  It was a great round.  I had known I've been playing well for a while and it was just so frustrating because I felt like I was going to shoot a low one, and it was great to get that.
Q. Can you put into words what that place means to you as a three-time champion?
CRISTIE KERR: Well, it kind of feels like a homecoming for me, and I've got my great friends the Whitakers who are like my adopted parents here.
So all the fans are amazing.  Sometimes you just get one place that's really special and this has been it for me.
Q. What kind of confidence are you bringing into the U.S. Open next week after a round like this?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I mean, just going to keep doing what I'm doing.  I knew there was a low round out there for me and felt good to get it.
Just going to take one day at a time and do mentally as good as I can, feels, everything.  Just don't change anything.  Don't put pressure on myself just because I shot one low round and go out and have some fun.
Q. Was that about an inch away?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I barely didn't -- if I hit it an inch harder I would've made it, yeah.  I saw Pernilla from a little different angle as mine.  She wasn't quite as downhill or down grain as my putt.
I saw her knock it about four feet by and might have made know a little more cautious speed-wise.  Yeah, looked like it was going to be in for a long time and just curled off to the left.
Q. It was a great putt.
CRISTIE KERR: You know what?  I hit the putt the way I wanted to.  Just barely didn't hit it hard enough.
Q. Looks like a tough read there.
CRISTIE KERR: It is a tough read, but I read the greens real well today.
Q. Apparently.
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah.
