Q. Obviously not the finish you wanted on the last hole, but other than that, are you happy with the way you played today?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I played really, really well.  I had other putts that could have gone in, too.  It's a birdie-fest out there, so you've got to shoot about a 10-under to really climb up there.  But I played really well.  I hit two good putts on the last hole, just my little putt broke a little more than I played.
Q. Was there a point where you thought you might be able to get up to the top, or did you think you were going to run out of holes?
CRISTIE KERR: I thought I was pretty far back with the course not playing too difficult.
Q. How do you think everything went this week for a first-time operation?
CRISTIE KERR: I thought it was great.  I mean, the clubhouse is massive.  It was unfortunate we had some delays, but I'm glad they got us off early today.  I thought it was a great golf course, and obviously a great sponsor.  Definitely look forward to coming back.
Q. Not surprised at all by these scores where you might have a winner that's 23, 24 under this week?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, you know, this course, the defenses are the wind and firm greens, and we didn't have a lot of wind and the greens were soft.  We all thought there would be some low scores.
Q. More fun, though, when you're playing golf and you're getting birdies, though, right?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, definitely, and it's great for the fans.
Q. How was it as prep for the U.S. Women's Open next week?
CRISTIE KERR: I thought it was great to play.  Obviously I played well, so it's always good to be playing well going into a major.  Always stuff to work on, though.
