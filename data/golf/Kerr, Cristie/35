 Q.  8-under par heading into the final day.  How does it feel, how was your day out there?  
CRISTIE KERR: The day was okay.  I really haven't hit my stride hitting it yet this week.  I feel like if I hit it good I'm going to be a force tomorrow.   
 Q.  Has it been hard to come off of Solheim?  Do you feel like you're rested?  
CRISTIE KERR: No, I definitely feel like I'm rested.  I've slept 10 or 11 hours a night since I've been here.  The first couple days I was tired but I feel okay now.   
 Q.  You mentioned some adjustments to hit it better.  What kind of adjustments do you need to make?  
CRISTIE KERR: Just need to hit it better.  Going to go video my swing on the range this afternoon, and maybe talk to my coach to see what he has to say.  I just got a little loose out there.  I hit a couple bad shots coming in.  I was right there, but I made a couple bogeys.  It's good to get a birdie at the last.   
 Q.  Brooke Henderson obviously set a course record earlier today.  Seeing that, did you know the course was going to be gettable?  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, if you hit it good on this course and get a lot of birdie tries, the greens are good enough to make some putts.  So it was good to see that she had a good day.
