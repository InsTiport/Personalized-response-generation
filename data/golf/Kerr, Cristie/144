Q.   Talk about how you played today. 
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, I think I played pretty solidly.   I had some putts on the front that I misread.   I probably just under‑read the putt on 7. 
Just over‑read the one on 8.
9, just kind of made a lazy swing at it into the green.
10 was an under‑ read.
I mean, I played good.   I made one really bad swing all day, and then had a bad gust (wind disturbance) made bogey and came right back.   You know, made a couple good key up and downs coming in. 
I thought it played a little tougher today where the pins were and the way the wind was a little different angle and a little stronger than yesterday.

Q.   You hung in there.   It's tough conditions.   Only a couple shots back.   Just talk your mindset going into the final round?
CRISTIE KERR:   Well, again, try and shoot in the 60s.   I kind of woke up and was a little sick this morning from some food that I ate. 
So I did good.   I hung in there.   Just do a little bit of practice and go home and rest. 

Q.   Thank you.
CRISTIE KERR:   Thanks.
