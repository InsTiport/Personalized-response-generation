   CRISTIE KERR: It played really tough today, and I didn't get off to a good start, at all, which is an understatement. I hit two lob-wedges, near the green in two on the second hole, and I was 2-over the first three holes.   
 So maybe a put a little too much pressure on myself but I eased into it and played great the rest of the day. Could have made a couple more putts, but I don't think there's too many people that shot under par today.  
  
  Q. I suppose when you start out a bit behind the 8-ball --  
 CRISTIE KERR: It's hard. It really is hard. Had I started out 1-under the first three, who knows, but I mean, I had to shoot in the 60s to win today, anyways. So that probably would have been the round of the day.  
  
  Q. Hard course to make up shots.   
 CRISTIE KERR: The pins were the toughest they have been all week today. That pin on the last hole, I hit 5-iron in and I roasted it. It hit hole-high and released to 40 feet. Just a great 2-putt. You're just asking too much -- you have to take advantage of the short holes and I didn't do that today.   
  
  Q. But you talked yesterday about trying to keep this a normal round, just do what you have to do. Did you feel that way or was it difficult?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I did feel that way. I think I just sort of got in my own way a little bit on the first couple of holes. You know, but conditions were a lot tougher today, and it's a lot -- it's a lot to ask to shoot a 67 or a 68 in these kind of conditions on this course.  
  
  Q. What happened on 1?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I just wasn't ready, obviously wasn't ready to hit the shot into the green and I kind of wasn't settled on what I was trying to do and I hit in the bunker. If it wasn't plugged it would have been an easy up-and-down. But I did good just to keep the third one on the green.   
  
  Q. A little sand action today in those earlier holes.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Lawrence of Arabia, 1, 2, 3.  
  
  Q. Understanding that you gave it your all, is there a sense of disappointment walking away?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Of course. I had two wins and I also had, probably, four or five other second or thirds. It's hard to have it come down to the last tournament. I did great to give myself a chance today, and you know, it will be a well-deserved rest.   
  
  Q. Where does this year rank for your career?  
 CRISTIE KERR: It's probably -- and I know I've had other years where I've won more tournaments, but overall, as far as consistency, it's probably my best year.   
 Financially, with this paycheck today, I have to go back and check, but I think it's probably my best year, I mean, the year -- if I did win more money in one year, we had a lot more tournaments. So it was probably my best year so far.   
  
  Q. You talked passionately this week a couple of times about your pride in being an American player and how much it would get to get the Player of the Year award. How do you think the state of American players is right now generally?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I think it's getting better. We are a lot more competitive than we have been the last couple of years. Paula and Morgan, you know, we are getting there.   
  
  Q. What are your thoughts on Yani's year?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yani had a great year. Besides winning the two majors, she won one more, Arkansas. That was the difference. I knew that I had to win probably three tournaments to win Player of the Year, and I just fell short, a little bit short. Not much. Not enough to hang your head on.
