Q. Just talk about the conditions of the day and how the course played.
CRISTIE KERR:   Course played a lot longer today and the greens were pretty similar but like around.  You couldn't bounce up a lot of shots.  A lot of shots would stop on the fringe short.
So it was kind of hard to get it closer to the hole, especially with the course playing longer.
But course was still in good shape.  Between the three of us we probably had six mud balls apiece out there, and they definitely affected shots.  They definitely affected two of my shots.  Sarah had four or five shots that really got affected.
So it'll be interesting with the rain coming tomorrow.  Doubt USGA will play it up, but they should consider it.  It's pretty muddy out there.
Q. Have you ever played a U.S. Open where they played it up?
CRISTIE KERR:   No, but there is always a first time for everything.
Q. It is 2020.
CRISTIE KERR:   It is 2020.  Maybe they'll give us a break for once.
Q. Do you think the setup was fair today?
CRISTIE KERR:   I do.  I do.  You know, they played it fairly short the first couple days, and, you know, this course yesterday played a lot shorter.
So it's an Open.  They're going to move it back.  That's just what they do.
Q. What do you think it's going to take tomorrow?  Do you think you can play aggressive enough on this golf course to make a move?
CRISTIE KERR:   I mean, I can.  It just depends on how I'm feeling, because last night was really rough.  Really, really rough.
This morning I felt better, but midway through like the front nine I started getting a lot of pain, and then it's like, I don't know, it's hard to go at them.  It's hard to complete my golf swing and really get through the ball.
Like i really mustered two great shots on -- I mean, I'm having 8-irons which I'm like kind of chunk holing into greens and it's definitely affecting the way I hit it.
I made an awesome birdie on the last hole.  Just it was like, Oh, thank God it's not an iron, because the hybrid was easier to hit.
I've just got to see how I feel.  If you're feeling it, you get rolling, just depends.  I hope we even play golf tomorrow looks awful.  Right?
Q. Yes.
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, looks awful.
Q. Should just start it again right now?
CRISTIE KERR:   But I'm glad we can't.  You're like in a winter here.
