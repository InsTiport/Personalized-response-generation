Q. How do you like your position heading into Sunday?
CRISTIE KERR: I like my position.  Honestly didn't hit it that great today, I scrambled a lot.  That last pin was really difficult.  It was kind of hard to judge the speed through the shadows, and I didn't do a very good job.  3-putted the last hole.
Gosh, you know, my coach just flew in today, so I get to go do a little session with him tonight.  Looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. Any adjustments for the weekend, for Sunday?
CRISTIE KERR: Well, yeah.  I mean, going to go work with my coach and try to hit it a little better tomorrow and give myself more opportunities to make birdies.
