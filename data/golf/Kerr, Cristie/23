Q. Juli Inkster said you bounce back better than just about anybody.  How were you able to do that?
CRISTIE KERR: I just had to give myself a chance.  Eun Hee is playing some great golf.  Seems like she's going to get two cars today from Kia:  hole in one and then another one.
I did my best.  I had a tough day yesterday.  It would've taken a super low round today to catch Eun Hee.  I'm happy with my first good tournament of the year.
Q. What do you draw from this tournament to take into next week's major?
CRISTIE KERR: I draw that I can bounce back.  I draw that I'm starting to play better and more consistent on my ball striking.
Just got to be a little bit more consistent mentally; maybe everything happens for a reason.
Q. We've all noticed how mellow and calm you are since becoming a mother.  How has that changed your outlook?
CRISTIE KERR: Oh, I don't know if that's actually true.  I may be fooling everybody.
Yeah, since becoming a mom I have a new perspective on things.  He gave me a big hug last night.  It was very, very much needed.  But I'm happy with my performance this week.  Going to try to build off that.
