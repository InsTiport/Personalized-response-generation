 Q.  I think everything switched at No. 10, but in your opinion was that where the match really switched?  
CRISTIE KERR: Absolutely, I did not expect her to putt it off the green, let's put it that way.  But that's what being a great putter is all about, because even if you have that 5-, 6-footer, they know you're going to make it, right?  So they have to give it a run to try to get up.  And with a dangerous hole location like that, it just worked out in my favor.   
 Q.  Did you know where you stood, the team stood, actually, while you were playing?  
CRISTIE KERR: More towards the end when we finished.  But I mean Mel's such a great player, I just had to try to take control of my match.  And that was the momentum that we needed.  And I felt kind of a little tight on the front and wasn't swinging at it aggressively.  And then when that got me going, I started hitting it a lot better.   
 Q.  You've been a star for Team USA all week.  How special does this moment feel to put another point on the board in this crucial match on top of that leaderboard?  
CRISTIE KERR: Huge.  And on the back nine, when I was looking at the leaderboard, it looked awfully tight.  And I knew that my match was going to matter so much.  And sometimes for the board you just need somebody to get up another hole.  So that's what I did.   
 Q.  You've been on many successful Solheim Cup teams, we know that.  How good is the team spirit and the togetherness been at this American side this week?  
CRISTIE KERR: It's been great chemistry.  Everybody has really gelled.  We all have had a lot of fun together.  I think we came out a little tight this morning, but I think we're starting to find our groove.
