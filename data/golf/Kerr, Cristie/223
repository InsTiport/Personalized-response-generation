  Q. Great conditions out there. Everything working for you, or is it just better conditions?   
 CRISTIE KERR: You know, the beginning of the round -- actually, today's round is similar to yesterday's round. You know, my first birdie of the day both days came at 6. Hit some good shots on the first five holes, just didn't manage to make the putts.   
 From there, just built momentum more and more as the day went on.  
  
  Q. Are you watching the leaderboard as the day is going on to see how close the leaders are getting to you?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Or I'm getting to them. Just a little bit at the end to kind of see where things are shaping up for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. How big was the birdie on 18?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I think it was pretty big. I hit a perfect drive off the tee and, you know, it's hard to hit the fairway now, so just to give it a go for eagle and it didn't go in, and tap it in for birdie. That's the way to do it.  
  
  Q. Looking forward to tomorrow, you have a great track record of come-from-behind wins. Is that in the back of your mind at all?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, it is. And, you know, I'm comfortable from there. Obviously, you know, leading the Open didn't work for me, maybe this will.
