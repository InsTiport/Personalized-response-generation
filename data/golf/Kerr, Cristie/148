 Q.   Solid performance today, you must be really pleased?  
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, I played very solidly today.   But I have to tell you, that 17th hole, it owes me, okay.   The year I finished second here‑‑ I'm going to go play that four more times right now.   
   
 Q.   You are such a prolific performer, year after year after year, the amount of Top 10s you have, let alone the wins you have, is phenomenal.   Where does your determination come from, because you're such a gritty player?  
CRISTIE KERR:   I am.   I guess that's just something you can't teach.   It's something that you're born with, and I just love competition.   I'm a horrible social golfer, I really am.   When I get into the heat of the battle, the adrenaline goes and I feel it and I embrace it and it's such a rush to play professional golf.  
   
 Q.   It's just such a never‑give‑up attitude, because regardless of your situation, even if it's a bad day, you're still out there trying to claw way at every birdie you can make.   
CRISTIE KERR:   I am.   I think that is what makes a great champion, because there's going to be days when you don't hit it well and you've got to be able to get the job done.   You know, today I hit it really well.   I missed a few shots but you're going to every day, and I put together a solid round, solid start to the tournament.   
   
 Q.   Other side of the scale, how is the winery going?  
CRISTIE KERR:   It's going very well actually.   Hopefully we'll be selling a lot of our wine in China fairly soon.   It's our third year, 3 1/2 years since being in business, and I think we are going to be able to turn a profit and be able to finally write a check for breast cancer this year.
