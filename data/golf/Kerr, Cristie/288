Q.  I know, Cristie, you guys, Nancy Lopez stuck with you as a team even after the morning didn't go your way.  You proved her right?

CRISTIE KERR:   We played pretty well in the morning, just couldn't get any putts to go in.

We hung in there and made big putts when we had to and, obviously, made a putt on the last to win.  It felt great.
Q.  Natalie, you're not finding it difficult to play with one of your best friends?

NATALIE GULBIS:   It's been pretty easy.  We hit really good this morning, they just outplayed us.  In the afternoon we played better together.  And they had to birdie three of the last five holes to take us to 17.
Q.  Thank you.

NATALIE GULBIS:   Thanks.

CRISTIE KERR:   Thanks.
