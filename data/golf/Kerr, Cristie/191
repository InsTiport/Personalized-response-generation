   MIKE SCANLAN: We'd like to welcome in Cristie Kerr, Rolex rankings No. 2 this week, seems to change every week. If you would just talk about your season so far and your thoughts on being here in Winnipeg. 
 CRISTIE KERR: It's my first time to Winnipeg, and I've had a fun week so far. I've got a lot of golf in, and it's been a little windy the last couple days, but working out, just kind of walking around the city. It's really nice. I've had a good time so far. 
 My season has been great so far. As you said, the rankings have been changing every week, and there's four or five people that can challenge with a win every week. And it's pretty amazing what Ai's done with five victories this year. You know, I've had a good season for me. I've had two wins and a lot of Top 5s and a second last week. I came close, and it's been exciting, that battle for No. 1. It seems like those four or five girls are all playing well to try and challenge. So I've had a great season so far, and I've got like eight or nine tournaments left, and I'm going to make the most of it. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Talk about CN and the CN Canadian Women's Open and how important an event this is to our schedule. 
 CRISTIE KERR: This is a huge event for the LPGA. It's the Canadian Open. It's their national open here just like our U.S. Open is for us. It's great that it moves around from city to city, and we get to go to places that we've never been before like Winnipeg. CN is a great sponsor. I'm fortunate enough to be a champion of this event. I won it at the London Hunt Club in I think maybe 2007 or 2006, and making a few less headlines this time because I don't have Wayne Gretzky with me. But besides that, it's a great event for the Tour. 

 Q. How much does that No. 1 World Ranking mean to you? 
 CRISTIE KERR: Well, I mean, it's what I've always dreamed of doing. I've been there -- I got there and then lost it and then got it back and then lost it again. And that's how competitive our Tour is. It means everything to me, and I'm going to leave nothing in the tank this year and however many more years of my career that I will have. Yeah, I want it, there's no doubt about it. I've just got to not put so much pressure on myself. I've just got to make the golf and my rest and my working out and stuff, the things I do on a regular basis every day, I've got to make that the focus and recognize there's all the other stuff but don't make it such a big deal that I can't perform. 

 Q. And I guess I'll ask you about the course, your thoughts. 
 CRISTIE KERR: I've actually played nine holes. I wanted to rest after last week on Monday. And I was just so tired from the LPGA charter; we got in at 2:00 in the morning and by the time I unpacked and got to sleep a little bit it was 3:00 in the morning, and by the time I got up I was just so tired and it was so windy out, kind of a little colder -- today is very nice, but I played nine holes yesterday, and I just wanted to go practice and hit some golf balls and chip and putt, and if I played 18 holes I would have been out there all day. 
 And then having a pro-am today, we play our own ball, which is great. So I'll be able to play the other side. My caddie scoped out the course a couple times, and I'll get to not only have fun in the pro-am but I'll get to see the entire golf course today. 

 Q. Talk quickly about last week. The back nine, the top four players in the world all had a shot to win. That doesn't happen very often. For those who say the LPGA needs one face, what would you say to them?
 CRISTIE KERR: I would say that we have many faces right now, and I think they're all great story lines that you need to play upon and write about and build on because this is the most exciting time for the LPGA Tour. It's great to have a player like Annika or Lorena dominate for so many years, but I think this is a more exciting time for us to where you just don't know what's going to happen. It's like a movie that keeps twisting and turning until the end, and then you go, wow, what a great movie that was. It kept you engaged the whole time. And I think we really need your help to write about the story lines and get the message out because this is a very exciting time for the Tour. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you.
