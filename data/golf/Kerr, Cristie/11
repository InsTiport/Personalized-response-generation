Q. Cristie Kerr, making it on the cut and a 6-under effort today.  What clicked for you?
CRISTIE KERR: I definitely hit it better and it was nice to get fresh greens.  Struggled which my swing a little bit on the back nine, but managed to still shoot under par, 1-under on the back.
Good thing my coach came in for the weekend.  We'll be able to go and work on it a bit.  You know, got into a groove early and was in a good mental place.  Missed a green on the back, chipped in, so kind of went my way today.
Q. Not surprised you found a groove out here.  You've found so much success at the Kia Classic:  Six Top 5s in your career.  What kind of confidence does that give you coming into the weekend with that success?
CRISTIE KERR: I think, you know, I love this golf course.  You can't really fall asleep on any shots out here, and if you do you're going to pay.  It's just such a great layout and it's in great condition this year, so just going to enjoy today, go put a little work in, and look forward to tomorrow.
Q. Have you checked out your 2020 Kia Telluride yet?
CRISTIE KERR: I have looked online at the packages and the colors, yes.  I can't lie.  I have.  It's pretty crazy.  That was my first hole-in-one to win a car, only third in my competitive career, so pretty cool.
Q. Have you decided on color you want?
CRISTIE KERR: I haven't yet because of course I have to discuss it with the husband.  Well, maybe not, but...
