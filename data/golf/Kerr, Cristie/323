Q.  Tell me about the match.
CRISTIE KERR:  We got off to a pretty bad start.  I mean, it's hard to recover from, you know, like a four down after 8 holes or something, deficit, but we played our hearts out there, and they are a machine, that's what we call them, as a team, they are a machine, and they are tough to beat, but they are not indelible, so  --

Q.  It seemed like your putts were just sliding back.
CRISTIE KERR:  We birdied the last two holes, but a little too late, they just topped us, so it's been great matches so far.

Q.  You looking forward to this afternoon?
CRISTIE KERR: Absolutely.

Q.  Good luck. 
CRISTIE KERR:  Thanks.
