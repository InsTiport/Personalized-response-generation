  Q. Things really bunching up as we head into Sunday. What are your thoughts heading into the final round?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I think the weather is supposed to be good, so it's going to take a low round, maybe a really low round, to overtake the leaders.  
 I definitely have that in me. (Indiscernible through applause.)   
  
  Q. After 9, after the little blip, you turned on; 31 the a back, I believe. Does that help you focus? You just get angry? How does that work?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I got pretty mad that I 3-putted 9. I had a perfect 5-iron into the green, and just kind of hit a little thin and right.   
 You know, that putt on 10 kind of got me going. I started hitting it a little better. I left a shot on 16; I could have eagled or birdied that hole, but ended up walking away with par.   
 A great birdie on 16 and a great save at 18.  
  
  Q. Seems like every player is going deep. Every player comes in and says the course isn't playing that easy, but everyone is just playing great golf.   
 CRISTIE KERR: There are definitely a lot of birdie opportunities out there, and the leaders are the ones that are taking advantage of that one more per nine.   
 You know, so hopefully I got to a real low round in me tomorrow.  
  
  Q. As defending champion, is it any more special to go out there and try and win, especially with the two runner-up finishes? Is it about that time?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, it feels good to be in contention to defend. Got to go out tomorrow and have a low round.
