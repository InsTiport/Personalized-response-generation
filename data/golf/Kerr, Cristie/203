   CRISTIE KERR: I'd rather be in this position and be delayed then, you know, barely making the cut.   
  
  Q. I know you'd rather be out there riding the momentum of the eagle and the birdie...   
     CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I can still do that when I go out there. You know, if it's over an hour are delay they let us warm up again.   
     You can't think that because you get delayed your momentum is gonna stop. There's been plenty of people in my position that keep it going, you know.   
     We'll never know, regardless, you know.   
  
  Q. It's an ongoing little topic, but trying to be the first American winner this year, does that motivate you?  
     CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, it motivates me a lot. It's necessary for our tour. We've had all Asian winners so far, and I think to show that we're a well-rounded tour, we have to have the Americans, Europeans, Asians, we all have to win.
