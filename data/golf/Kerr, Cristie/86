 Q.  Really strong start this morning for you guys.  And now kind of coming back out, what's the mentality?  One hole left, all square for tomorrow.  
LEXI THOMPSON: Me and Cristie did really well today.  We got off to a hot start in both of the matches.  And both the other teams, they fought on the back nine to get a few holes going their way.   
But we'll come back tomorrow early to finish our last hole.  We're pumped, we're going to be ready.  We're just going to go into tomorrow like we did today and commit to our shots.   
 Q.  I know you guys didn't have much light left at the end of the day.  What was the decision on 17, how close were you guys to not continuing on to that hole?  
CRISTIE KERR: To 17?  We were okay for the 17 tee shot.  It got pretty dark once we got to the second shot on 17.  Once Carlota holed out and then we both hit our shots, it's like it's too dark to be out here anymore.   
 Q.  I asked Lexi the same thing, but being all square, one hole left, you guys just approached it as a fresh start, it's just a one-hole decision?  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, they're not up.  We're all square going into 18.  Anything can happen, obviously.  Our focus is to birdie the hole.  Whoever gets a half or a win, that will be tomorrow morning.   
 Q.  I know afternoon these matches didn't go exactly as you guys want.  But still having the fact that you've got two matches out there with the possibility of two points, is that how you go in looking at tomorrow morning?  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, we're just going to try to get some rest and get physio and get ready for tomorrow.  Yeah, hope's good.
