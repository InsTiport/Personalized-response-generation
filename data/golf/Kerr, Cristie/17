 Q.  What a long day.  How are you feeling?  
CRISTIE KERR: I actually feel pretty good.  My best two shots of the day, (horn sound) we're stopping play.   
 Q.  You and Lexi continue to ham and egg it.  I know you like match play.  When you get into situations like that, slow start and you absolutely rebound, you have to feel good for whenever play is again.  
CRISTIE KERR: For sure.  Thank God I had a partner today, and I've got one hell of a partner.  She carried me around the course like Thor's Hammer.  That's how heavy I was.  I started to come alive a little bit at the end there.   
We're 1-up, maybe going to go to 2-up.  Who knows if we'll play tomorrow, but it was fun watching her under pressure like that just play some marvelous golf.   
 Q.  For people who haven't been in an experience, how difficult is a day like today mentally?  
CRISTIE KERR: Pretty tough.  I actually played pretty well this morning, and when I kind of sat down I feel like maybe a slowed down a little.   
But I feel way better than I did yesterday.  Maybe I was kind of overswinging a little bit.  I'm playing with some long hitters, and I think that maybe I was trying to overswing or get a little more distance than I needed to.   
So nice to get a rest and ponder that we were up.  It's nice to go to sleep being up.
