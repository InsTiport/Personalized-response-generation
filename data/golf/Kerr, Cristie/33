CRISTIE KERR: She had so much pressure on her this week.  You know, more than a major, I told her.  I was joking around, but it was true.  Look at the people out here for her, they all want her to do well, and she wants to do really well for them.  You could see she was tight.  I didn't want her to miss the cut with all these people coming out to watch her.
It's great for the tournament.  It's great for her, and the fans to support her and not only her, but our tournament as well, everybody else.  So I just thought it would be really good for the tournament if she played better.  So just kind of put my arm around her and I said, "It's time to dig, kid."  She said, "I'm digging," and I said, "Dig harder."  She played really well from then on in and had a great day yesterday.  So that was good for the fans.
Q. You've had such a long and great career.  Could you imagine the pressure that she was going through?  Were you ever in a circumstance like that?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, Solheim Cups and at other times as well.  But I just tried to pay it forward a little bit.  There were a lot of people that wouldn't do that.  I just wish somebody would have done that for me when I was younger in my career.  A couple people did, but you can always pay it forward.
Q. Is it extra challenging to play in front of a gallery that big, people that big?
CRISTIE KERR: It's always people moving and cameras snapping, but we're used to it.  It's not that big a deal.  I was used to it last week as well.
Q. Coming off 18 you made a point of stopping and letting Brooke take the walk.  That's usually the champion's walk, but I guess you saw the cause?
CRISTIE KERR: Well, she's Canada's champion, so it was fitting.
