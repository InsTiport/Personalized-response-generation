 Q.  Certainly wasn't easy out there, and a great fight back from you, as well?  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, it was tough.  I hit it so well yesterday, and I mean, that shows you the difference.  I didn't hit it that great today but I still managed.  My caddie and I managed the golf course well, and we made the recovery shots when we needed to.   
So just going to go hit a few balls and try to find the feel.  It's hard when you play back-to-back in heavy wind with the swing, but we'll work on it.   
 Q.  To give us an idea how tough it was out there, give us a couple examples what it was like on the front nine.  It was howling.  
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, it definitely kind of laid down a little bit for the last ten holes.  Not much though, but enough.  We got really lucky with these two storms that passed.  You know, just depends on the hole, the wind direction, how it plays.   
Had a 3-putt early, and just managed to just stay patient and try to hit some good shots, and I did.   
 Q.  And you got the momentum back coming home.  Heading to the weekend, it's going to be pretty much, if you hit par twice, you've got a great chance, haven't you?  
CRISTIE KERR: You never know with the weather.  I'm trying not to get ahead of myself in this weather.  You know, just try to hit it pretty well and make some putts and get up-and-down sometimes, and we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  In terms of playing with Karrie, how was that?  Obviously you two go back a way.  
CRISTIE KERR: It's fine.   
 Q.  You must have done it a few times.  Do you remember the last time --  
CRISTIE KERR: For the last 20 years.   
 Q.  But as the final pair together.  
CRISTIE KERR: I have no idea.  But way to go for the old girls.   
 Q.  The experienced girls.  
CRISTIE KERR: Experienced, yes.  You know what, write that.
