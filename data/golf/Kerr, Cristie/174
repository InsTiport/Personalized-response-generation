 Q. Pretty windy conditions out there on the golf course today?
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah it, it was it was pretty windy. I couldn't make a putt to save my life. I couldn't buy one. 

 Q. The greens, what's the best way to read them?
 CRISTIE KERR: They are a little more grainy this year I think than in years past. There's been a lot of rain from what I understand the last couple of weeks but sometimes you miss putts because you're hitting bad putts. I must have missed from six times today and from a momentum standpoint you can't get anything going and it's very frustrating.

 Q. But your ball-striking has been good?
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, it's been good. I did the best I could and do my best tomorrow.
