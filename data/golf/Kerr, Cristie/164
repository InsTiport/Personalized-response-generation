   THE MODERATOR: Through 16 holes, 2-under at this point in the Women's Open, Cristie Kerr.   
  
  Q. When did you find out the decision that play would be suspended?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Just five minutes ago. Shocking. I mean, I know there is a lot of stuff in the area, but it gets dark at 8:30 or 9:00 here. So it's shocking.   
 Some of my best friends, like Morgan Pressel, they haven't even teed off, so it's gonna kinda be a domino effect for the rest of the week.   
 At least there is a week off after. If we had to go to a Monday finish, then I guess that's what it would be.   
 Starting to lightning all around us here.   
  
  Q. Have you ever seen this much golf suspended in the first day of a U.S. Open?  
 CRISTIE KERR: No. I mean, not in all the Opens that I've played. You know, usually they'll keep you here and try and get as much in as possible, but I guess the forecast looks so bad.   
 I mean, it's just so odd. We were going up 5 fairway and kind of saw one cloud and it didn't really look that bad, and then we were on 6th green and we started hearing it rumble.   
 Within 10 minutes it just sort of popped up.   
  
  Q. (Question regarding No. 7.)   
 CRISTIE KERR: No, I actually, I hit it right off the tee. I didn't have too bad a lie in the rough, so I didn't need a great shot.   
 I'm in the front right bunker, so it would be a tough up and down.  
  
  Q. You had just birdied back-to-back holes.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Right.  
  
  Q. How frustrating is it to have the interruption?  
 CRISTIE KERR: It is, and, you know, I've got a tough shot coming up ahead. At least I'll get to practice it in the morning, you know, before we go out.   
 It will be a 7:45 a.m. start. At least I will get to practice some long bunker shots before we go out, so maybe it's a good thing for me.   
 It is what it is, you know. I have finished plenty of U.S. Opens on Monday. It's a big field. If you get any weather whatsoever first couple days with this size field, you're not gonna finish.  
  
  Q. This course is really hard. How difficult would it be to cram 72 holes into three days?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I think it would be really difficult, especially with the forecast. I think it's this kind of forecast every day. I mean, I think probably after cancelling golf today, probably gonna be looking at making a cut sometime on Saturday.   
 So, I mean, I think that it would be a stretch to try and fit it all in by Sunday. That's with, you know, no weather the next three days. I don't know. Whoa, it's a bumble bee.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the two birdies?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, actually made an unbelievable par save on 4. I hit it right, which you just can't do. I mean, I dropped, you know, 10 balls in the practice round there and didn't get one of them up and down. I just gutted it out and hit an amazing flop shot to about 15 feet. Probably the best I could do out of that lie. I walked that putt in for par.   
 And then, you know, hit it just a little left on the tee on 5 and hit a great, you know, iron from the rough out to about 20 feet and made that; then I hit gap wedge like a foot on the next hole.  
 So, you know, I had some momentum, and, you know, that's the way it goes sometimes.   
  
  Q. What's the mental prep like after something like this overnight where you're in between rounds? Is it different than overnight, say, between rounds?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I don't think I understood the question, but, you know it...   
  
  Q. A long day ahead of you. Is it more of a mental game?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Not really. This is my 15th year on tour, 16th year being a professional. This stuff happens all the time. You have to kind of roll with the punches. I think the lightning is moving in a little bit. I think we need to hurry up.
