  CRISTIE KERR:   I just hit it fairly close on the back and nothing went in.   A long up‑and‑down the ridge putt lipped out.   Had some trouble with four lip‑outs on the back.   Was hitting good putts, so just got to keep my head up and look forward to a good weekend.

Q.   Everyone says even par at the U.S. Open is the way to go.   You're right there, and you agree with that, obviously?
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, I think scoring even with the windy conditions is a little bit better than normal.   I think they're probably going to speed the greens up, make it a little more difficult on the weekend.   Just got to keep playing the way I'm playing and have some putts fall.

Q.   So obviously you said yesterday you need to do a little bit of work on the ball‑striking?
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, I hit it so much better today, and just didn't quite score.
