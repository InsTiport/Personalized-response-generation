 Q.   Obviously, the conditions are rough today.   The wind and the course being a little different, so kind of talk about what that was like?   
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, it was a lot tougher.   I bogeyed both parâ€‘5s on the back nine.   You know, that's something you can't really do in an Open.   You have to turn those into birdie opportunities, and it's unfortunate.   Kind of got on a bad stretch on the back, but other than that, other than those three or four holes, I've played beautifully this week.  
   
 Q.   You when you said you played really well overall, what would you say you've been doing best?  
I've been hitting the ball well; I've been making putts.   You know, judging the speed on the long putts well, just got to make a few more putts and a few more mistakes tomorrow, and I could move way up there.   You never know in an Open.
