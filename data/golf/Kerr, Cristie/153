  Q. Talk about your day.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, we fought hard. You know, we got off to a rough start, and just couldn't really seem to get any momentum. And then all of a sudden they missed their par putts on 10, and it was like go time.   
 I almost made a long putt on 11, and almost made eagle on 12. We got back to level, and we never got up in the match. That was kind of the difference. We had a chance to tie it on the last hole, but it was a lot to ask to make a chip and a putt from that length in the dark. So, you know, we fought our heart out.   
 You know, but our team, you know, we got one and a half points out of the afternoon when it looked like it was kind of all blue up there. We have to take that into tomorrow.
