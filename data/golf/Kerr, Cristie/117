Q.   Two days in a row you have it going on.   What about this course kind of suits your eye and your game? 
CRISTIE KERR:   You really have to hit shots out there.   It's a course you really have to shape the ball off the tee and be creative.   I played very well the last couple of days.   It's unfortunate I bogeyed the last hole today.   It's what happens when you hit an errant shot and have to chip out to a difficult pin.

Q.   What do you think looking at the top of the leaderboard with the names there going into this weekend?
CRISTIE KERR:   I think it really shows you the caliber of this golf course and the condition that it's in.   Just got to keep doing what I'm doing.

Q.   Do you and Inbee play off each other at all?   It looks like you exchanged birdies. 
CRISTIE KERR:   Sure, it's always fun to play with Inbee.   She always plays well, and I enjoy playing with her.   Probably going to play with her again tomorrow.

Q.   Are the Solheim girls pretty tired?   They've been through a lot, but it looked like a lot of them are playing really well. 
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, I mean, I had enough rest.   Today is the first day I played in the morning.   I played the practice round Tuesday afternoon, and then Proâ€‘Am and then first round in the afternoon, so I've had a lot of sleep.   I'm actually fine.

Q.   How are the greens today compared to yesterday?   You talked about them getting crusty. 
CRISTIE KERR:   I think they're a little smoother, little smoother today.   I certainly didn't want to leave myself that putt I had to make bogey on the last one there because it was above the hole and outside the hole left to right.   I made a good bogey putt.   Glad it wasn't in the afternoon.
