Q.   Hole‑in‑one on 6.   Unfortunately we didn't get to see it, but what happened on 6? 
CRISTIE KERR:   It was my best hole today.   Hit a 9‑iron.   Just told it to get up a little bit, just a titch.   I said, In, and it went in.   So first hole‑in‑one I've had in a long time on tour.

Q.   Talk about your round as a whole.   I know you didn't finish the way up wanted to. 
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, honestly I didn't hit it very good today.   I made, you know, a lot of kind of unforced errors.   I was scrambling a lot.
To even shoot under part the way hit it was kind of a victory.   It's unfortunate, the last hole.   I didn't expect to get a shot into the green and actually hit a good low one.
Just didn't end up making the par there.
