 Q.  Fantastic performance, but at some point it looked like on the back nine that the Europeans were really starting to come back.  But Cristie, a great putt on 16 and a fantastic shot there.  What is it you find within yourself at this moment?  
CRISTIE KERR: You just try to stay calm.  It's hard in this format, especially alternate shot.  But Lexi and I are really comfortable together.  We just have to stay calm and stay the course and just try to hit good shots.   
 Q.  Lexi, in your words, what is it like to have Cristie as a partner?  
LEXI THOMPSON: She's amazing.  She's always here to cheer me on.  Even if I hit a bad shot, she's always there to pick me up if I'm down.  That's what a partner is for.  That's why we love team events, because we're not only playing for ourself, but we're playing for the person next to us, that's what's great about it.   
 Q.  You guys had a successful international pairing together, was it something you have been looking forward to since then?  
CRISTIE KERR: I think so.  You never know what's going to happen with pairings, obviously.  But we're just comfortable with each other.  And you know what, I mean, this girl stays loose, she's hard to beat.  And I'm proud to be her partner.  Hopefully we can keep it going.   
 Q.  Lexi, do you guys anticipate playing this afternoon?  
LEXI THOMPSON: We'll see.  We still haven't heard.   
CRISTIE KERR: We haven't heard yet.  We're going to go in and get a bite of lunch and see.
