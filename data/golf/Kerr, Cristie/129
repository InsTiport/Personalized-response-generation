 Q.   72, did you leave some out there?   
CRISTIE KERR:   I did.   You know what?   God, I had some putts on the front nine, which was my back, I just hit great putts and they just didn't go in.   I kind of made a couple bogeys late, but got one back on the second to last hole.   Yeah, definitely.   
I think it's probably about as easy as this golf course can play today.   There was really no wind, so the golf course was definitely firming up as the day went on, but it wasn't like, you know, how it could have been.   I thought it was very scorable today, and I didn't play that great and I shot even.  
   
 Q.   The movement of the tees, were you kind of expecting that?   
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, definitely.   It plays hard enough that you don't really need to play it at the full 6850 because at any time it could blow 40 miles‑an‑hour out here, so you've got to protect against that a little bit.  
   
 Q.   What went a little bit south?   
CRISTIE KERR:   Just my ball striking; I'm going to go hit a few balls with my coach.
