Q.   There's going to be a playoff here.   You guys played great today.   Cristie, you really came out focused. 
CRISTIE KERR:   I mean, there's really just no time to mope after a mediocre or bad shot, there just isn't.   They're just too strong a team that we're playing against and we tried to keep the pressure up.

Q.   You guys kept the pressure up all day.   Lexi from 10, 11 and 12, or 11, 12 and 13, with an eagle in there and putting great.   Going into this playoff system, if you guys stay the same, would you guys go out there or have you talked about it or what's going on?   Any strategies? 
LEXI THOMPSON:   We're going to talk about it.   We don't know of anything yet.   We're hoping that we halve this match, if not win it, so we don't have to think about it. 
CRISTIE KERR:   First things first.   We're feeling good, so if they want us to go, we're ready.
