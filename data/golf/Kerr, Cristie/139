Q.   Talk about the conditions today versus the first two rounds, a little bit more wind.   Did that affect play today?
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah.   I mean the course ‑‑ the pins were a lot tougher today, and the conditions were tougher and the greens bouncing out a lot.
I had a lot of long putts that I just misjudged the slope on and I had 33 putts today.   Not really having terrible speed.   It was just kind of an off day for me. 
I made a dumb mistake on ‑‑ whatever, 14.   It was just kind of a dumb round for me today.

Q.   When something like that happens, when you just don't have your putter and you have a final round tomorrow, how do you kind of reassess and give it a go tomorrow?
CRISTIE KERR:   Going to go low tomorrow.   We'll see if the conditions allow.   Obviously there's been one low round every day.   Na Yeon beat the field by like 12 shots today and that's pretty remarkable.   I wouldn't expect her to do the same thing tomorrow statistically.   So maybe I can pull out a low round.
