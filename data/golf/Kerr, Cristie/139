 Q.   So tell me about the experience of the week.   
CRISTIE KERR:   The experience was great.   I played great the first two days and just wasn't consistent enough on the weekend.   And it played tougher on the weekend, so I needed my A game coming into the weekend and I had my B game.   
   
 Q.   What do you take from a week like this?   
CRISTIE KERR:   I take the positives away.   The first couple of days leading a major almost.   Within a shot, pretty much.   I fought really hard in the weekend.   It just wasn't my weekend.   
   
 Q.   What was the differences you saw between 1998 and coming back in 2012?   
CRISTIE KERR:   I think it played more difficult the last time we were here.   But I knew the course setup and the course conditions and a little bit of wind on the weekend would make it play tougher.   And we've seen that in the scores.   
   
 Q.   What do you have to say about the way Na Yeon has played the last couple of days?   
CRISTIE KERR:   She's having a dream weekend.   She deserves to win.   
   
 Q.   You know what that dream weekend is like.   What do you hope to take from that if she pulls it out?   
CRISTIE KERR:   Well, you know, I think this will be her first major, and there's nothing better.   
   
 Q.   Great.   Thanks, Cristie.
