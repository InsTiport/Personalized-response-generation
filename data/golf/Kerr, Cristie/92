  THE MODERATOR:   All right, everyone.   Like to welcome Cristie Kerr into the media center.   Currently tied for second right now.   Pretty good day out there, just ran out of holes? 
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, I think so.   Started sort of a birdie barrage at the end.   You know, I played really well today.   I could have had three or four more putts go in, but 5‑under on this course is great.   Can't complain.
THE MODERATOR:   I was going to say, 5‑under is a pretty good round.   It's just tough to catch Inbee because she never gives shots back; right? 
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah.   She just played a little bit more consistently than me this week, I think, and I had an even‑par round, which didn't help my cause, but I can't complain.   I played really well all week.   I was great mentally today and that was my goal, and I thought I had to shoot at least 5 or 6‑under to have a chance, and I did that.
THE MODERATOR:   I know you said you saw your coach this week.   What did you take away from that heading into this week?   You hadn't been pleased with your play the last two weeks since Kia. 
CRISTIE KERR:   Well, I finished Top 10 in Hawaii, and it's really hard to judge your game there because the wind is, you know, 35 miles an hour every day.   So I played well there. 
But last week I just didn't hit it well at all, and you know, we worked on my swing.   Michael and I worked on my swing and just refreshed what we were doing, and I definitely saw a difference in my ball striking this week, so I'm excited to keep playing, and I'm excited to have a week off, too.
THE MODERATOR:   Perfect.   Like to open it up for questions.

Q.   Cristie, how key was the 12th hole?   What were the key holes on the Back 9 this week that probably separated the difference between yourself and Inbee?
CRISTIE KERR:   I think the whole back is great.   10 obviously was not playing as short as it has in the past, so making a birdie there was a great way to get the back started.   The eleventh hole, the par‑3, I've never played that hole for four days having‑‑ you know, I hit like 5‑iron every day, maybe 6‑iron one day, and last couple of years I was hitting 7‑iron and 8‑iron, so they made that hole with that green a lot tougher. 
12 didn't play easy.   13, when the pins were over on the right, there were some good birdie options, but the greens were slopey.   And then the 14th hole is a bit of a goofy hole.   Just gotta try to get it in the fairway there.   I bogeyed it today, which kind of hurt my chances.   15, 16, 17 and 18, I mean you can't rest on your laurels.   The whole Back 9 is awesome.

Q.   Your approach on 12, is it hard to get a ball close to that flag stick?   You pulled it a little bit.   You were talking about trying to get it to kick off the hill.   Is it hard to get a ball close there?
CRISTIE KERR:   Actually it wasn't anywhere near the hill, but I was wanting it to‑‑ the wind to get it, and the wind kind of died.   I hit that iron exactly the way I was trying to hit it, but just the wind didn't get it.
Yeah, you don't really want to try to play it off the hill because it's not as firm as it used to be.   So I've had a great putt.   Just didn't hit it quite hard enough.   But you know, it's just a great‑‑ it's such a great golf course.   There are‑‑ you need a little bit of luck on some of the bounces on some of the big left to right sloping fairways.   You need to hit it where you're looking because if you don't, with the bounces out there, you can get behind some trees, and it's just a good course. 

Q.   If you think about here last year as well, what is it about this course, is it something that fits your eye or is it a great driving course?   What is it about this course that you really like?
CRISTIE KERR:   I think it's kind of an old‑school course.   It's‑‑ you have to be just so good mentally, because if you're not, if you don't start ball in line off the tees, especially you can get behind some of those trees and it's a very different golf course when that happens. 
I don't know.   I like the mental challenge of this course.   I love playing in Texas.   I think the fans out here are great, got a great sponsor.   Everybody loves coming to Dallas.   You know, I've got some great friends here, and I always have a good time when I come here.

Q.   Looking down at the leaderboard, seeing Juli there, how cool is that?
CRISTIE KERR:   It's very cool.   Makes us all stay on our toes.

Q.   What do you take away from her as a captain?   What do you think she's going to be like as a captain?
CRISTIE KERR:   I think she'll inspire the best in us.   She'll inspire us to leave it all out there and play with heart.   And you know, the team is really shaping up well.

Q.   Karrie said she was the most competitive person she's ever met.   Is that pretty close to accurate?
CRISTIE KERR:   Pretty much.   But she's trying to keep it light and easy, and once we get to Germany, I think the emphasis will be on learning the golf course and the process of things and not getting caught up in everything else because we're the underdogs, so we gotta go get it.
