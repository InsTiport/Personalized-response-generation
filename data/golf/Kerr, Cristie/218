  Q. You guys fought really hard and you got back into this match. Just your thoughts coming down the wire here?  
 CRISTIE KERR: We did, and I wish I could have been more help for Nicole. I just didn't hit it great. She was a rock on 17, and if they would have missed that, there's no doubt in my mind she would have made it and we would have got a half.   
 That's the way it goes. You've got to have two putts for birdie and put pressure on them. I wasn't able to do that in the morning. I'm going to go hit some balls with my coach, and I'm rolling it good, so --  
  
  Q. How long was that putt on 17 about?  
 CRISTIE KERR: 35 feet.
