DANA VON LOUDA:  Well done today, 9 under 63, for an 11-under-par total.  Talk about today for us.
CRISTIE KERR:   Let's do my card first.

First, I hit my driver, I had to punch out made a good up and down out of the bunker for par and made a two foot putt.

Second hole, I hit driver, 6 iron to about 15 feet and the putt lipped out so I made birdie there.

Birdie on 5.  I hit 8 iron and made about a 23 foot putt.

7, driver, pitching wedge and made about an eight foot putt.

8th hole, I hit a 7 iron to about 12 feet and made that, 15 feet and made that.

Ninth hole, I was in the     I hit driver off the tee into the short fairway bunker, just short and right of the hole and blasted out to about six feet and made that.

I hit driver, 5 wood into 10 and 2 putted from about 22 feet for birdie.

12, I hit driver, 8 iron on to the hole and made about a 21 foot putt.

13, I hit 7 iron to six feet and made that.

Then 18th hole, I hit driver, middle 9 iron to nine feet behind the hole and made that.
Q.  Second best score of the day?
CRISTIE KERR:   It is.
Q.  Can you believe that?
CRISTIE KERR:   Yeah, and by a girl that's probably seven years younger than me.  Good for her.  What's she at right now, 10 under?  Oh, wow, so she was at 1 over?  Wow.
Q.  Do you think you perceive that scoring was like this today, having such a low round?
CRISTIE KERR:   Well, I felt that there was, just from the way I have been working on my game and progressing.  I felt it was possible and I think that's the first step to believe that it's possible.  I made a huge par save on the first hole which swung the momentum in the middle of round.  I think I made most of my birdies and those are some of the tougher holes.  So I played really, really well today and I have a chance on Sunday.  So I won't put pressure on myself to try and do it again tomorrow because anything can happen.
Q.  Why are the scores lower today?
CRISTIE KERR:   I think there's less wind today.  Maybe some of the pins were a little bit more difficult but I don't think the course was any easier.  By and large I think when the weather is good and you have the best players in the world, you're going to see that sometimes.  Although this is pretty unbelievable.  I'd be a betting woman to say that she's never shot that in tournament before     well, I'm wrong.  I meant to say any lower.  She's very talented.  And from Finland, I think, where only hockey players usually come from.
Q.  Do you like British Open golf?
CRISTIE KERR:   I love British Open golf.  I've never won overseas.  It's definitely a goal of mine.  I'm enjoying the moment.  This is a course when you first look at it, you might think, oh, okay.  But you get in some of those bunkers and the more you play it, the more you like it.  And the more you play it, the more you respect it and you realize just how really tough this course is.
Q.  What do you think about the links?
CRISTIE KERR:   I like both styles of golf.  I played Ballybunion; that's partly a links.  I played Killarney which really isn't.  I played Royal St. Annes, which I consider to be a links.  This course is a little bit different than that.

I like both styles.  I just like how everything is a little bit more rugged, a little bit more natural, and you've really got to be patient because if you can't get the bounces, you've got to be patient.

This style of golf, there's a lot of different types of shots to play.  And the greens, you can fly to the pin, you can usually run it up, all sorts of choices on short game.  I think it's a pure form of golf.
Q.  Appeals to the imagination?
CRISTIE KERR:   Absolutely.
Q.  Are you a shot maker?
CRISTIE KERR:   More so now than a couple of years ago.  I've really been working on my short game, learning to hit these types of shots.  The U.S. Open this year, the course was nothing like this, but we had a lot of  undulation on the greens and I worked really hard on my short game, so I'm learning to hit different shots and still evolving.
Q.  What types shots into the greens?
CRISTIE KERR:   I usually play a little bit of a draw, but I can work the ball left to right and I'm learning how to do it on command a little bit more.  I'm fine tuning my swing to be able to do that.
Q.  What do you expect tomorrow?
CRISTIE KERR:   If conditions are still the same tomorrow?  You never know.  2  or 3 under by the leaders could win it.  Somebody could shoot a low round from way back in the pack.  It just depends.  Se Ri came from way back at Kingsmill this year to win.  I came from back behind the lead to win.  It could be a crapshoot if the weather stays good.  It's I guess whoever gets a hot putter.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Thank you.
