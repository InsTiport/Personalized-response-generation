Q.  (Inaudible.)
CRISTIE KERR:  I don't know, really.  I don't know.  I really, haven't    I finished, I haven't been able to get a look at the leaderboards, but I wouldn't think so.

Maybe.  Who knows.  You never know.  Crazier things have happened.

So we'll wait and see, I guess.
Q.  What went right today?
CRISTIE KERR:  A lot of things went right.  It didn't seem like anything was going my way.  I missed a couple short putts, one for par on 5, one for birdie on 6 and then I made an unbelievable birdie putt from the front of the green.  My sand wedge spun back on 8, way off the green and I made it from about 60 or 70 feet, I don't even know what it was.

And then birdied 10.

Birdied 14, 15, and 17.

And then I absolutely nuked my drive on 18 and my caddy and I just, we didn't judge the conditions very well.  We had 131 to the pin, trying to fly it about 130, trying to get a good birdie opportunity.  And that's up to me, I more than anybody misjudged the conditions.

I should have hit a little nine and I decided to hit it almost full, not quite full.  And I just, I ripped it.  I absolutely ripped it over the green.  And I almost chipped in for par.  Which would have been really nice.

But sometimes you never know.  Golf's a crazy game and this week for me has been really up and down.

I'm just glad to get a good round in and give it a shot.
Q.  Did you know the situation?  Were you aware?
CRISTIE KERR:  Yeah, I did.  And frankly, you know, we couldn't feel how much the wind was helping, and on top of that, I hit it about as solid as I could hit it.  Which is kind of inexcusable when you got a hundred feet of green or more from the front of the green to the pin, but what are you going to do?

I'm experienced and I played in a lot of these situations and the only person I can blame is myself and I had a great opportunity and that's what I set out to do.  And it's a shame that it had to end that way.  But I had a bad lie in the rough when I dropped it there and I'm just glad I was able to give it a good go and get that up and down.
