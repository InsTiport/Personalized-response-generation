   PETE KOWALSKI: Minus 1 through the championship. Cristie Kerr. 

 Q. Long day. I'm sure you're not excited about having to come back tomorrow and doing it all over again. 
 CRISTIE KERR: I have two holes left. The tournament is not decided yet. I think she's over there celebrating. We all have a chance. 
 There are two accessible pins on 17 and 18. I'm playing great. I'm going to go out and swing for the fences and hopefully tie it up.

 Q. You did play very well. Any reason? Were you rolling putts well or attacking pins? What was your success?
 CRISTIE KERR: No, I mean, just solid U.S. Open golf. Unfortunately I three-putted the 11th hole. That was a tough pin, and I had a very long up-the-ridge, into-the-mountain putt, and I left it way short.
 I had a good second putt, but it was hard to two-putt that one.

 Q. What's been the hardest part with all the delays?
 CRISTIE KERR: All the delays. (Smiling).
 It's been a very long week. You know, I'm excited I get to come out here and finish it tomorrow, because, you know, playing the last two holes in the dark probably wouldn't have been fun. 
 Playing that much golf and having that much of a long day, I'll come out fresh tomorrow and rested.

 Q. How strange is it to come back tomorrow knowing exactly what you have to do?
 CRISTIE KERR: I think it's good, you know, because you can get mentally geared up for it. I'm gonna give it my all. I mean, I always do. 
 There's other players still on the golf course that have a chance that have more holes as well, so it's not over yet.
