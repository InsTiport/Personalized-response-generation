 Q.  Tell us about your ball-striking.  It seems to be improving week-by-week.  How is your health and how do you feel about your game?  
CRISTIE KERR: I feel pretty good.  I really worked on simplifying my swing with my coach last week, and gone back to some old feels and I think I should stick with them.   
 Q.  A two-time major winner, you're a legend of the game and you know the history of the game.  How important is this one for you?  
CRISTIE KERR: It's very important.  But I've played this tournament so many times that it has -- you should not put extra pressure on yourself, because the people that do inevitably never win.  It's very early in the tournament.  I'm super happy with my first round and I've just got to take it day by day.
