 Q.  How do you feel?  
CRISTIE KERR: I feel great.  I played great all week.  I didn't get any good breaks today.  Even when I hit a amazing shots, like it would stay up on a slope and not roll back like they usually do.  I played awesome, though.   
 Q.  That run of pars, was that frustrating?  
CRISTIE KERR: No.  Pars are good on this golf course, and you can sneak a couple birdies in -- you know, I want to shoot four rounds under par here and I did that.  That was great.   
 Q.  Did you get the news about Lexi?  
CRISTIE KERR: I barely just heard about it.  I'm not comfortable talking about it because I didn't see what happened.   
 Q.  Do you feel that viewers should be allowed to e-mail or call in with what they see?  
CRISTIE KERR: I mean, that's a really tough -- that's a really tough one.  I don't think they should be allowed to call in.  If people in TV see it or something, that's fine.  I know people want to be a part of it and that's also part of viewership.  It's been a controversial thing for a very long time.
