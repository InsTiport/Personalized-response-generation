  CRISTIE KERR:   I didn't play 17 and 18 well all week.   If you're going to win here you have to take advantage of those holes.
Didn't hit a good putt on 17 today.   18 I could've got there in two right in front.   Maybe had an eagle chip and just hit a bad 3‑wood.   Just kind of left a lot of shots out there this week.   Just kind of hit it bad and missed a lot of putts. 

Q.   What do you take away from this week, though? 
CRISTIE KERR:   That I had a good bad week.   I'm officially in the top 5 and happy with my caddie now.
Just going to keep working on my game.   Going to see my coach next week, so look forward to that. 

Q.   Anything in particular about the last two holes?
CRISTIE KERR:   No.   I mean, historically I think I haven't played the last two holes well here for some reason.   Hadn't played this tournament in quite some time. 
It was great to be back.   The fans are great here and it's a great golf town for us.

Q.   How hard was it to bounce back from last week?
CRISTIE KERR:   I was great.   I mean, I was not even in‑‑ I mean, I tried to play golf and probably shouldn't have with the passing of my husband's father and I was sick as a dog. 
So, yeah, it was great to bounce back.   I've got a lot to work on though. 

Q.   And his sickness...
CRISTIE KERR:   He was very sick for a long time and he's in a better place now.
