 Q.  Defending champion, how does it feel to be back here at the Kia Classic?  
CRISTIE KERR: It feels amazing.  I thoroughly enjoy playing this golf course.  It's a great test.  It's also the most beautiful golf course I think that we play, with all the different flowers and color out there, so it's great to be back.   
 Q.  What makes this course such a good test for your game?  
CRISTIE KERR: You know, you have to have an entire game here.  You need to drive it straight.  You need to be accurate with your irons.  You need to have great speed and green-reading ability on the greens.  The greens are severe, and very quick, so you have to have total game here.   
 Q.  Is there anything that sticks out to you about your win last year?  Maybe one shot or one memory?  
CRISTIE KERR: Wow, I mean, there's so many.  I remember all the putts that I made.  I remember it was first week after my caddie's father had passed away and this is kind of the unfortunate anniversary of that.  But we got a win for him, and so it was pretty amazing.   
Hitting that 5-iron into the green on 18, as pressure packed as that was, with everything on the line, that was a great shot.  It was a great memory.
