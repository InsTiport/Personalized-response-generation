Q. Talk about just having that huge honor.
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, I found out a couple days ago, and I was floored.  With a chance to be able to go to Augusta in front of all the sportswriters and accept this award, it's awesome.  I mean, it's crazy to be viewed by them as somebody worthy of this award, so I'm very honored.
Q. Have you been to Augusta?
CRISTIE KERR: I've played Augusta.
Q. Oh, when did you play?
CRISTIE KERR: Maybe four, five years ago.  But I have never been to actually the tournament.  We have things to do, and hopefully I can stay for part of it, but it'll be pretty cool just to be there.
Q. Obviously your work with your charity and everything, just to get recognized for that type of stuff, we try to celebrate you just for what you do.
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah.
Q. But to be recognized by so many people in an organization like that --
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, and it has to be unanimous, as well, so I must be doing something right.  Morgan Pressel was a recipient of that award.
Q. Have you talked to her at all about it?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, and she said it's pretty amazing to go and be in that room, so I'm just very honored.
Q. How cool is that for back-to-back LPGA players?
CRISTIE KERR: Yeah, it's huge for our Tour, and I think it totally needs to be exploited.
