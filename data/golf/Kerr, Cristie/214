   THE MODERATOR: Welcome. Thanks for coming in here. You're enjoying a great year thus far. One win, you're on top of the money list for the year. If you can just kind of talk about the year, and how you're feeling coming into this week?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Besides my allergies today, I played the course beautifully. Hit the ball great. Putting and chipping are back to where they were around the time of Kingsmill and the British and Evian. I think that I'll be ready to play this week.   
 Yeah, I have been having a great year. I've done a lot of stuff right. The last couple of weeks I've been trying to rebound after the Solheim Cup a little bit, but I think I'm going to be ready to play here in Arkansas.   
  
  Q. Just kind of wondering what you think of the course changes and how that will play into your game?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Sure, I think they're going to be great for me. I think what they've done for the golf course turned out beautiful. The greens are amazing. They're putting very true, nice speed. Not bumpy at all. I think the changes they made to the course made the course better, so I like the changes.   
  
  Q. Do your allergies normally bother you like this?   
 CRISTIE KERR: You know, it depends where we go. It depends on what's in bloom. I'm highly allergic to ragweed, so I think with all the rain and everything, it's come out. And I forgot to take my medicine this morning. One of my guys had one of their wives go get some Zyrtec from the store, and I took it on the 18th hole, so it hasn't kicked in yet.  
  
  Q. How important would finishing on top of the money list be to you?   
 CRISTIE KERR: It would be very important. It's definitely one of my goals and something I want to achieve this year. But I can't lose sight of how I've gotten to this point, which is doing the small things well. Do my mental stuff well, you know, working out. Later in the year it becomes more difficult to try to do those things because you're more tired.   
 So I think I went home after Canada for a day and a half, to Arizona. And I saw my dog, and kind of went in the house, slept in my own bed. I think that kind of has recharged me a little bit. I feel more rested.   
 I feel like the last couple of weeks in Canada and Portland I might have put a little too much pressure on myself. But still, not playing well, I finished in the top 20. So I think that's a sign of how I've elevated my game.  
 You know, I feel a little bit more at peace with what I have to do and what I'm trying to do this week. So I think it's a good thing for me.   
  
  Q. In the Solheim Cup, I think you had a quote to the affect of I want to clinch for the team. I think maybe they clinched it before you got to that point?  
 CRISTIE KERR: They did.  
  
  Q. Was that for the benefit of having the other players on the team and inspire confidence?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I think, yes, definitely. But I do mean what I said. I would have loved the opportunity to clinch for the team. Or if it came down to an 18th hole, to make a six, seven-foot putt to win, I wouldn't let my team down. I would do that, and I almost did.   
 I think that Beth Daniel was a great captain, and Meg and Kelly Robbins were great assistant captains. They shuffled around for the singles where they wanted to. Towards the end of the singles rounds they had us positioned perfectly. That if it came down to us -- which it did in the last couple of matches -- Morgan was behind me and closed out her match before I finished.   
 You know, I was one up. Had to hit a perfect drive on the 18th hole. Everybody was running back and forth on the green on the 18th hole. And it's hard to want to hit it at the green when there are people running around. I hit it way right, but had I needed to win that hole or have that hole for the Solheim Cup, I would have been prepared to do that.   
 That's why you play the game. That's why you want to be one of the best in the world because those are the fun things to do.  
  
  Q. What does winning the Solheim Cup mean to you?   
 CRISTIE KERR: It's definitely one of the highlights of my career. It's playing with your very best friends and peers in a team event. It's one of the LPGA's marquis events. It's playing for your country, for your teammates. It's definitely one of the highlights of my career.   
  
  Q. We talked to Michelle Wie yesterday and she singled you out as somebody who helped her along and was a leader on the team. Helped her with things. What kind of things did you do for Michelle to convince her of what the Solheim Cup is all about?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I've played every practice round with her. I've known her since she was 12 years old, and we've become very good friends. She is a great kid. She really is. And I say kid because she's still 19. I'm 31 now, turning 32 this year.   
 I played every practice round with her. She was my partner. I was surprised we only played one match together. But I just tried to make her feel comfortable and let her know what to expect, because she said even just around us during the week that it's so much more than she expected. I tried to prepare her for that. Thank you, guys.
