   CRISTIE KERR: I took a lot of club on 16 because the wind was starting to pick up and started doing real crazy stuff; it was really into the wind and then really downwind and we didn't know what to do. Just had to wait for it to come back. On the last hole, I start the rushing a bit and apparently I got a good break from the marshal on my tee shot and just rushed the second shot a little bit. But then I've just got to keep my head up and I played well.   
  
  Q. How different are you now from a few years ago?  
 CRISTIE KERR: I think I'm older obviously and more mature and I realise what you have to do within yourself and I can't really control what anybody else does, so I'm going to try to have a good attitude tomorrow and hopefully I can hole some putts.   
  
  Q. Were you impressed by how aggressive you are, and how you really go for it?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Well, I try to take the opportunities as they come.   
  
  Q. A lot of birdies and bogies, a topsy-turvy round, how does that affect you?  
 CRISTIE KERR: Making a bogey makes me mad, but you know what, this course is difficult and it shows you how good my round yesterday was when I shot 65 in difficult conditions.  
 I played well today but only 2-under and bogeyed the last, so just have to try to get off to a hot start tomorrow and we'll see.  
  
  Q. Having won the U.S. Open 13 or 14 months ago, how much would it mean to you to win a British major?  
 CRISTIE KERR: It would mean the world to me. It would be the second leg of a career slam and points towards the Hall of Fame.
