   THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us today. We have Momoko Ueda. She is one of the LPGA Tour rookies. She did very, very well in the LPGA Japan in 2007. She won an event last year, and also won the 2007 Mizuno Classic to help earn her LPGA Tour card. And this year this is your second year as an Ambassador for the Evian Masters. You did it in 2007 and 2008. Can you just kind of talk about how you feel to be here at Evian Masters in 2008?   
 MOMOKO UEDA: This year is obviously different from last year, and the view is kind of different and my motivation and the condition is very different.   
 So I'm very looking forward to playing in the tournament tomorrow.   
  
  Q. What does your position as Ambassador for Evian entail?   
 MOMOKO UEDA: After I got signed as an Ambassador, I start drinking Evian more than I used to. And I really like the water.   
  
  Q. What are you doing this week for Evian? Any special events?   
 MOMOKO UEDA: I was at the ceremony at the Junior Cup, and I had fun. And I got to see many juniors. Yeah, it was fun.   
  
  Q. When you play on the LPGA, what do you miss most about Japan?   
 MOMOKO UEDA: The language. Everyone is very nice to me. So I miss the language and country, but I'm having fun also.   
  
  Q. Do you have a coach in America?   
 MOMOKO UEDA: No.  
  
  Q. A Japanese coach?   
 MOMOKO UEDA: Yes.  
  
  Q. So you see them when you go back to Japan?   
 MOMOKO UEDA: Of course, yes.   
  
  Q. What part of your game has changed? This year is your first year on the LPGA. Has anything changed about your game, have you gotten better?   
 MOMOKO UEDA: I started focusing on my short game and distance control is getting better, like wedges and everything.   
 So I'm working on the short game right now.
