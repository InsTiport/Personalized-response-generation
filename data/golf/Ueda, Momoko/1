 Q.  You have won twice this tournament,so you must feel confidence playing this tournament?  
MOMOKO UEDA: Golf course is different but playing with top players, I can keep my motivation high. Every year I enjoyed playing with different players. And I feel it's getting more competitive. It is necessary to make more and more birdies.  I tried just to follow that, and very happy to be in this position after the second round.   
 Q.  Many Fans are expecting for your third title of this event tomorrow?  
MOMOKO UEDA: This is special event for me but I just want to do my best for three days. I haven't won this year, so if I can win tomorrow it would be very nice.
