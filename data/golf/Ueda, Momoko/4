  Q. With two back-to-back eagles, talk about your round and being 6-under par in a major.  
 MOMOKO UEDA: In a major, I'm so excited and this is my first time and I made an (back-to-back) eagle, so it's very exciting. I'm so happy.  
    
  Q. After making your first eagle on nine, what did you think when you made your second one on 10?  
 MOMOKO UEDA: Especially because I made an eagle, and then I did it again, I feel like I am developing my golf very much over last year, so it feels good.  
    
  Q. What were the course conditions like today?  
 MOMOKO UEDA: There was no wind, and my group was very nice so I feel very confident and calm to play.  
    
  Q. Was the course playing different than yesterday?  
 MOMOKO UEDA: Every day the course changes, and the conditions change and the wind and the weather. But, my image gets better and better every day and it feels easier than yesterday but I'm not sure about tomorrow.
