JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I felt pretty good playing in the morning.  You know, it's nice to get off early.  I almost felt I was the only group out there, but I think that was a key factor today because I was really relaxed and it really felt like no one was out there so it didn't quite feel like an Open, but there was still a good crowd out there.  But playing as an amateur, I don't know, you know, I just try to go out there and just try to hit a lot of fairways and greens, like, play my own game, play the game I'm accustomed to.  But I don't know.  I think I feel kind of comfortable out there now just from last year's experience and I think just from playing at lot of big tournaments. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN: Yes, in Baltimore. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:   Right, north of Baltimore City. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  They came separately actually. They didn't meet until they were both in Baltimore, but they came in around 1971, 72.  My mom was a nurse and my dad came.  They both weren't planning on staying, they just kind of came for like the time being and then took it from there. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  In Baltimore. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  It's a Thai restaurant. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  We did that for like the first year just to save money to buy a house and then it was fun, I mean, it's kind of a building that is like a house so that's just the top floor.  
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN: Psychology. 
 

Q.  How many birdies and bogies?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  3 birdies and 3 bogies. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  5, I was kind of lucky. 
 

Q.  Tell us about 5.  That has been a hard hole.
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Average drive.  I probably had about 170 something into the green, so played about 155, 156 downhill.  I really didn't aim for the pin.  I aimed to the center of the green and I put a little cut on it and it ended up about two feet, so that was the highlight. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I hit a 6-iron. 
 

Q.  Say, I wondered if I might ask, what is the mindset of you right now after 36 holes, U.S. Open, tough golfers; you are plus one, you are going to be walking out there with a lot of pros, plus 6, plus 7, even higher.  What is your mindset?  Is there a little good feeling?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes, it is definitely a good feeling.  I don't know.  I am really in it for the experience. It is wonderful.  It's so fun to be out here.  I love the golf course and I am hitting it well, so my confidence is pretty high,.  But I guess basically I have nothing to lose, so I don't get nervous out there because, you know, as long as I know I tried my hardest, I really don't fear the worst or anything. 
 

Q.  As an amateur the goal first is to make the cut and see what you can do on the weekend?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Definitely.  First goal was to make the cut and so that is finished with, I guess. 
 

Q.  Was the golf course tougher today and yesterday in terms of pins and what did you feel about that?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  It was probable a little harder.  Some of holes were flip-flop, but the pins weren't in their hardest positions.  You know, the course still plays just as hard, though, because it's really tough to keep the ball on the green. 
 

Q.  Jenny, you made the cut last year also, right?  Did  you remember how you played on the weekend last year and the goal this year may be to play better on the weekend?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  After I made the cut last year, yes, I don't know if I got exhausted or tired or lost of focus or something.  I can't really pinpoint it, but, yes, I played very well on the weekend.  Yes, my goal is to play just as well on the weekend and just, you know, keep plugging away at it.  Anywhere I finish, I will be pretty happy. 
 

Q.  Another ACC golfer made quite a splash at the Masters and at the U.S. Open in San Francisco, and I just wonder if maybe you were thinking in your mind, now, let's see what the women's side of ACC golfers can do?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes, it's always nice to see another amateur do well.  He is actually a good friend of mine and, you know, I don't know, it's always -- I don't know about the ACC.  I guess, you know, we have some good players in there, but I don't know, it's always exciting to see someone else do as well.  It is nice to see what he does from here. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  We just met each other in junior golf, we played together. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Not really, since college.  I see him every once in a while, just in passing. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Joey. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  He is 21. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes. 
 

Q.  Did they close the restaurant?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes, this is the first time they closed it over the week.  I finally persuaded them to close the restaurant. They might do it again for the Curtis Cup. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Probably, wow, since maybe third grade, so. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Maybe twelve years, thirteen years. 
 

Q.  What is the name of the restaurant?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  The Bangkok Palace. 
 

Q.  Are the greens hard, the surface?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  They are getting hard.  When  the pin is in front, it is pretty hard to get it close. Yeah, that happened to me on 17, that pin is just -- tough to  -- really close to the hazard line and I hit it just past the pin and it was on the -- it was on the back of the green, so I guess for the weekend you are going to have to see some high shots coming into the green. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Some of the holes, yeah.  You can bounce it on. 
 

Q.  What is your schedule like after this as it revolves around the Curtis Cup?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I am playing in the Transnational next week.  It starts the 13th.  Then the Curtis Cup and the Amateur, that will be it. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  You are welcome. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Thank you.
