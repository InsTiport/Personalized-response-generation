JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I hit a 5-wood and I was probably about 190 -- 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  About three and a half feet. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I don't even know if it has hit me yet.  That is just incredible.  I don't know.  I don't really know if I am really, you know, really realizing what is going on.  Wow, like, tomorrow is just going to be a blur probably. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yeah, I will definitely be able to sleep after today. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  It was just -- the wind was just brutal today, I guess.  But, the pins were pretty tough too.  But I just went out there expecting that bogeys were going to come and that -- just to keep plugging away at it. I made a couple really good par saves, one on 12, which was really -- 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  No. 12, I pulled my 5-iron to the left.  I flung my chip out of the thick grass.  Made probably about a downhill 20-footer for par.  I almost can't even remember the front 9 right now. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yeah, the wind was -- I mean, on a couple of holes you just had probably three clubs different.  I'd say probably on four, five of the holes, you really couldn't even go for the pin.  Pars were just great out there today. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  She is just an incredible  player.  I played with her when I was a freshman and she was a senior at Stanford.  I just -- I love -- I am a big fan of her swing just because it is really compact.  When I did play with her, I played so well because just by watching her swing, it was such a good change to look at for my own swing. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Wow, I don't know -- I don't even -- what is it, four shots, five shots? 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Wow, I mean, the chances are there.  I just -- I guess I am just going to hope that the putts fall.  I am kind of scared to see what happens if I do win.  But -- 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I am going to try my hardest, but -- I don't even know.  I can't -- that is just going to be a dream come true, I guess. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Not yet.  I haven't been able to talk to them.  We usually meet like in front of the putting green or in front of the clubhouse door, after, you know, a couple -- like 20 minutes after I am finished.  But I haven't talked to them yet. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yeah. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  That is just an incredible finish.  I don't know, just to hit into the water and actually gain a stroke is just - I mean, that is what the Open is all about, just the turnaround is just -- it is always there, it is always -- anything can happen, I guess. 
 

Q.  Have you ever played in wind that was as bad as this or anything comparable in this type of wind?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I played in the East Regionals last year.  Actually, our team didn't make it to that last year, but we played in wind even stronger than this. It was just constant.  It makes it really hard to -- actually I have a hard time concentrating 100% on my putts because the ball is shaking and, you know, on the tee -- when you tee off, too, just when the wind is gusting like that, it is so hard to keep your balance, keep your rhythm and focus 100%. 
 

Q.  Last year's Open experience, how much do you think that is going to help you tomorrow dealing with the pressure? 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Oh, it has probably helped so much already.  I think it has just kind of gotten me accustomed to the people, the people watching.  The crowd is great, though.  I mean, I love anyone watching women's golf. It is so nice to see so many people enthusiastic about the game.  I think last year was kind of maybe my run through for this year.  But, I mean, I don't know specifically how it has helped, but I think probably for the nerves has made me a little -- probably made me less nervous playing in front of people. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yeah, both Brenda and I. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I think I got her by a couple of shots last year. 
 

Q.  What is it like as an amateur to be going into the final round up there on the leaderboard being in one of the last groups?  Can you talk about that?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Being an amateur?  I don't know, I think it is really nice, actually, to represent amateurs, in general, just because it is a strong field.  I mean, the college players today are just -- are getting better and better, as they always say.  But, there is so many good players playing in college and it is always nice to see them -- see a couple of people do well in a major event like this. 
 

Q.  Have you thought about how this might affect your media future if you win this thing?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I don't know, I am probably not going to listen to anything if I do win. 
 

Q.  Where is your parents' restaurant?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  It is in Baltimore, Baltimore City.  It is just north of Johns Hopkins.  It is not in Downtown, probably near to the city county line. 
 

Q.  What kind of restaurant?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  A Thai restaurant. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes. 
 

Q.  I just wanted to know if she did get first or second would it change her plans regards to when you plan to turn professional?
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Probably not.  Next year probably after I graduate. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Yes, less than a week. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  I think we are all really supportive of each other and just for all of us to be able to play in this Open and just to be, you know, be put in the position of playing this hard course and with the pressure and everything, it is going to probably -- it is a great preparation for when we play August 1. 
 
JENNY CHUASIRIPORN:  Thank you.
