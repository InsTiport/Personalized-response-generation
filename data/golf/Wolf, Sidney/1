 Q. It's been challenging obviously today with the conditions. But give me some thought on today and what we can look forward to on the weekend? 
 SIDNEY WOLF: Well, the golf course is in better shape than most of us knew it would be after 14-plus inches of rain. It's held up very nicely. It was the nicest thing to see after all the hard work to see them finally tee off in more than three groups. 
 So as far as this weekend, we're looking forward to seeing some of the best golfers in the world here. Our local players will be here, and we're expecting very large crowds to come, and the weather should be much improved for the next two or three days. So we're looking forward to great golf and a lot of excitement.
