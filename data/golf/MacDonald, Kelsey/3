 Q.  Good start on the tournament.  
KELSEY MACDONALD: Yes.  Very, very happy with my start.  I got a good couple of birdies in the first few holes, which was nice.   
And got one of my best friends on the golf bag as well.  So she's caddying, so that also makes it more enjoyable.   
 Q.  What's her name?  
KELSEY MACDONALD: Katie.  She's PGA assistant Golden Golf Club.  So yeah, it's really nice to have her here this week.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on the golf course?  
KELSEY MACDONALD: I love coming back here.  This is my favorite event in the year apart from the Scottish Open.  Yes, they look after us so well here at this course.   
 Q.  What is so special about this course?  
KELSEY MACDONALD: I'm not sure.  It's just got a really good flow to it.  Each hole is different, but I just seem to get momentum which is really good.  And the girls I was playing with both played really well and a good friend as well.  So it made it easier.   
 Q.  This is your fifth visit or fourth visit?  
KELSEY MACDONALD: Fourth maybe.  I received an invite to play, I think, four years ago and then my category got me in the last three years.
