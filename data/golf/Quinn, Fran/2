Q. 10 and a half holes to finish this morning?  Does that sound right?
FRAN QUINN: Correct.
Q. How would you assess it?
FRAN QUINN: It was great.  I came out and made a good par on the first one, I drove it in the right rough on 8.  After that I birdied five of my next nine holes.  So I really played solid coming in.
Q. When can you remember a nice morning start like that for awhile?
FRAN QUINN: It's been awhile, but I'll take another afternoon one like that right now.
Q. Comfortable out there with the way the golf course is playing for you?  Fits your eye?
FRAN QUINN: It's very good.  It's going to get more difficult as the week goes on.  They had to protect it a little bit over the last couple days, or the first day, just because of the weather, and now it's going to dry out, I'm sure it's going to get a little bit more difficult.
