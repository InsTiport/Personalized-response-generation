 Q. Let me just ask you, hopes and dreams are here to grab or slip away.  Today you had an idea in mind that just didn't happen for you.  What was the situation for you?FRAN QUINN: I didn't make any of the putts.  I missed all the short putts for par and I missed all my makeable putts for birdie, and in this type of championship, you have to make those. If you do make those, that keeps the momentum going.  I didn't do that.  That's -- and then I had a horrific finish, finishing bogey, double bogey.  I had a wedge into 18 just in the native grass, the ball came out sideways into a side bunker and I just made, I made double. So disappointing finish, still been a great week.  We're going to go out, we're going to try to shoot a low score tomorrow and finish it off in style.  But to do what I did today is really disappointing.
Q. What was the biggest challenge for you today?  The greens?  Fairways?FRAN QUINN: No, no, the putting.  The putting was for sure.  The pins were in very difficult spots and I just did not make a putt.  Not one.  So you don't make a putt, you're not going to score.
Q. Sunday, you mentioned what you want to do.  Is there a specific target in mind for what you want to achieve on Sunday?FRAN QUINN: I want to go out and play some solid, good golf and walk away with hopefully an under par score tomorrow and that would be a good day.
