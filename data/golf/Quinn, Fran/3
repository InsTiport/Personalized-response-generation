 Q. What are you going to do with the 2-under back side here?  How will that help move you forward for the rest of 2014?FRAN QUINN: It was great week, and I know that it was a week that had great promise starting the week.  And I'm a little disappointed personally on how I played this weekend.  But having said that, I know I have a lot of great golf and I will play some great golf the rest of the summer.  Hopefully I'm playing next week at Travelers.
Q. Are you qualifying tomorrow morning?FRAN QUINN: Yeah, I'm hoping to it, I'll either qualify or hopefully get a spot, I don't know.
Q. Did this week meet your expectations, exceed them, just the whole experience for you?FRAN QUINN: Yeah, I think it definitely exceeded all expectations.  I mean, it was just from the standpoint of having my son on the bag, having a chance -- leading the U.S. Open on day one and being around the lead all day.  It was something that Owen and I will always remember and talk about for a long time until he's leading the U.S. Open.  (Laughter.)
Q. Owen, you're going to stay on the bag through the summer?OWEN QUINN: I'll caddy a couple times through the summer.  I'll play my own junior golf at home, but whenever I can I will be.FRAN QUINN: I think after this weekend he's fired me.  (Laughter.)
