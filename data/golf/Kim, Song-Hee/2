   SONG-HEE KIM: (Recording in progress.) I stay there, and I think I had a great day today.  
  
  Q. To be tied for the lead after three rounds, how is that going into Sunday now?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: I mean, it happened before a lot of times, so I know what I need and I know what I have to do.  
 So I just try to play my own game and talk to caddie more and enjoy it.  
  
  Q. At 18 here there was a little concern, but you handled that pretty well.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, I was thinking I needed like little shot, but I have to hit a full one. But, anyway, I had a great lie on bunker, so I knew I'm going to have par.   
 So I had a lot of confidence, and I think that's why I made a par.  
  
  Q. Do you have good confidence going into tomorrow?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, I need it.
