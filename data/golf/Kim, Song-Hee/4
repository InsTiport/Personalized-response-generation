   MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, Song-Hee Kim. She finished in the top 10 in every tournament but one played this year. She's having a great round. 1-over par 72. Good playing, Song-Hee. Just tell me, how did the golf course play? How hard was it?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I think the golf course is harder than any golf course, like I think first time I played this much hard in my life. The greens were really fast and firm. The rough is really thick and fairways narrow.  
 MODERATOR: What else?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I think everything hard for me.  
 MODERATOR: You started on the first hole. You bogeyed the third, and then you had two birdies. One on 6 and one on 7. What club did you hit to the green on 6, the par-3 hole?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I hit a 7, 7-iron. I forgot how far, but it was close to 165.  
 MODERATOR: How long was your putt?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Um, only hitting 150 yard on the front side and roll to the hole, so it was 15 feet.  
 MODERATOR: 15 feet, all right. Then on No. 7, how long was your putt?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Um, eight feet.  
 MODERATOR: Eight feet, all right. Then you had a bogey on No. 9. How did that happen?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Because I miss fairway, and I layup from bunker. Then I hit a hybrid and missed left side, and I chipping from left side and two putts.  
 MODERATOR: Another bogey on 14.  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I had a great tee shot, and only 110 yard. I hit it short and I hit a three-putt.  
 MODERATOR: Okay. Then No. 17 you had a 3, a good birdie there.  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I was talk about caddie, about No. 17, because we figured out hit a 3-wood or driver, but I decide hit a driver on the left side, and I chip and almost made it.  
 MODERATOR: You almost made a 2.  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes.  
 MODERATOR: How close to the green were you with your driver?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: 15 yards.  
 MODERATOR: 15 yards? Okay. How long was your putt, if you almost made it? Just a little tap-in? A little tap-in, okay.  
 18 you bogeyed. How did that happen?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I hit a good driver. It was only 160 yards, and I hit a 7 on the right side and it was short. I chip from the bunker shot, and I had a two-putt.  
 MODERATOR: So you were in the bunker on 18 and two-putted?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes.  
 MODERATOR: All right. Were you pleased with your score?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, really happy about that with this hard golf course.  
 MODERATOR: Any questions?  
  
  Q. I saw you hit into the high weeds on No. 2. You chipped backwards into the fairway. How much did the way you played that hole kind of help your round, you know, that you kind of got into some danger and got out of it and went for par on No. 2? How much did that help your round that you didn't get frazzled and have a bad round there?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: That was really big par for me, because I hit a hybrid tee shot. It wasn't good lie. Like I almost think about like one club...  
 MODERATOR: Unplayable?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, unplayable. My caddie and I decided just hit it on the right side, and I use with 9-iron and it left 140 yard and I hit it 8 iron, with 8 iron. I hit a great shot there. It was pretty -- yeah.  
  
  Q. How far was your putt?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Four feet.  
  
  Q. How difficult is that hole itself just with all the hazards around it and the pin placement?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I think it depend, tee shot. If I hit a fairway, it's not really that much hard. But if I miss the fairway, I don't have chance to hit it to the green.  
 So the important things I think need hit fairway first.  
 MODERATOR: You started playing golf when you were 11 years old. Was there a player who inspired you to become a professional golfer?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Se Ri Pak.  
 MODERATOR: Se Ri Pak. Many, many young girls she influenced.  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. Well, when I start golf, because she won a lot of tournament, and she's kind of hero in Korea so everybody look her.  
 MODERATOR: Looked up to her?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes.  
 MODERATOR: Have you ever played with her?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Actually, I played practice round yesterday with her.  
 MODERATOR: First time?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: No, not first time, but I play -- I practice yesterday with her.  
 MODERATOR: That must be pretty special to play with her, your hero?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: When I play first time, I did. But now I know about her and she know about me, so we're pretty good friends.  
 MODERATOR: Pretty good friends. That's very nice.
