 Q. Take me through the round and what was working really well for you today? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Today my putting was really well today. I had like five birdies and I make a lot of putts and especially that's why I think I don't have much bogeys, because I only had one bogey for two days. So I've been putting really well.

 Q. Were there any key holes for you where you had a good birdie that kind of got you going? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Because I only try to think about the spot, nothing else, because I didn't really think about how to stroke, how to swing, so I've been trying to think about where I want to go. So I think that's helped me a lot for two days.

 Q. Up near the top of the leaderboard. You have to be happy with where you are and happy with how you've played the first two days. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah -- I really miss Top 10 with my name on the board because I've been playing really kind of not well. So I tried really hard. I'm really happy about it. I can see now my name on the board.

 Q. The course, how is it playing? I know everyone said yesterday the greens were really soft and scoring conditions were pretty good. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: It's been raining yesterday, so I thought it was a little softer than yesterday, but it gets pretty good drier. So today is much better than yesterday, and the green conditions were really good. 
 I think it depends how the wind works, but it didn't get windy much today. It was beautiful today.

 Q. Do you expect more low scores for the weekend? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Hopefully. Hopefully I'll play better than yesterday and today, but I try my best.
