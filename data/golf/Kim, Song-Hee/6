   GREG BALL: 5-under today? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. 

 Q. How many birdies? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Four. 

 Q. What did you do well? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Putting was really well today. It was, you know, the green was not really good. 

 Q. A little bumpy? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, a little bumpy, sure. I knew it was going to be tough, but I was more like -- focused more on the stroke, not making. 
 So that's why I think I had a good putt today. 

 Q. Okay. Any particularly good holes, good birdies? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: 16. 

 Q. Sixteen? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, it was about 7 yards, but I saw someone go before me, and I was thinking just putt it straight and I did, and I make it. 

 Q. Okay, good. As of right now you're tied for second, going into the weekend, could change by the end of the day, but how do you feel? Are you happy about your position going into the weekend? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, I mean, I feel really good about second place. 
 You know, hope I can putt well in the third and fourth rounds. 
 GREG BALL: Thank you.
