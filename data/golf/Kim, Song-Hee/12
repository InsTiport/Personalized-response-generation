   JASON TAYLOR: All right. So you finished at 5-under.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: 6.  
 JASON TAYLOR: 6. Even better.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: (Laughs).   
 JASON TAYLOR: You're the leader right now, after Round 1. Talk about the finish with the birdie on 18. Just talk about how well you played today.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: I was really calm today, and I tried talking with my caddie. And it was really good. I felt good, and my caddie helped me play too well, so it was good.   
 JASON TAYLOR: What did you and your caddie talk about? Movies?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, movies. About movies. We watched the "Moulan" movies last night, so I told him a little bit about that.  
 JASON TAYLOR: Was it good?   
  
  Q. What movie was that?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: "Moulan."   
  
  Q. How have you been playing lately, and you know, do you have a lot of confidence coming into this tournament?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes. I mean -- well, actually when I was in warmup this morning, I've been pretty bad feeling.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Tired?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. I was really tired. And I didn't feel good. But you know, he tried telling me to positive thinking.   
 DAVID POITEVENT: Explain to them about four in a row and five in a row tournaments.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Oh, yeah. This is the fourth tournament for me, so a little bit tired.  
 DAVID POITEVENT: She only plays three, and we went from Korea, Portland, Canada, here. So four in a row. She doesn't play four. She only plays three and then rests.   
 So this is four. So she was a little bit this morning, maybe a little tired and stressed because next week is Samsung, a big tournament. So she wants to rest, you know. She was doing a good job. She was really solid.   
  
  Q. She usually plays three in a row?  
 DAVID POITEVENT: usually three in a row.  
  
  Q. This is four in a row.   
 DAVID POITEVENT: right. But she wanted to come here.  
  
  Q. Playing so good today, you're on one, what will you try to do tomorrow to keep the playing up?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Well, I'm going to try to do the same as today, like keep trying to talk to my caddie maybe.   
  
  Q. Do you talk to your caddie a lot when you play?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Sometimes, yeah. If I feel good.  
  
  Q. If you feel good? Boy, you felt good today.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. (Laughs). Because I needed more like confidence today, so I tried to talk to him.  
  
  Q. So he helps to give you more confidence?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes.   
 JASON TAYLOR: All right. Excellent.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Thank you.
