   MIKE SCANLAN: Song-Hee, 7-under par, 7-under today, 65, with a birdie on 18. How did you play today?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: I was very relaxed because I just came from Korea. I still have like very tired for the time change, so I'm not trying to do hard play today. I just want to play easy.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Very relaxed?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes, on the front nine.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: You were 6-under through 10 holes; how were you feeling?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: I was feeling like, you know, I had six birdies until the 10th hole, and then my swing was really comfortable and my putting was feeling really comfortable, too. So I think that's why I played 6-under through ten holes.   
  
  Q. How important was it for you --  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah, well, I had a missed putt on the back nine, a couple of birdie putts I missed. And my swing was getting a little tired, and I was thinking, I need maybe one or two birdies.   
 And the last one, I was thinking if I make this, I can get more constant. That was really important to me.   
 On the front nine, I can trust on my swing and putting, everything. But back nine, I got more like tired and then it was a little bit -- I don't know how I can hit it.  
 But my caddie told me, just trust on your shot, and that was a lot of help to me.   
  
  Q. And what about tomorrow, do you still feel good?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: If I sleep well, I think it will be fine for me.   
  
  Q. What do you think your chances are for a win here?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Even last year, I had a lot of chances to win, even though I didn't win last year. This year, I didn't know I can like play ten times on the Top-10. I didn't know that. Then I had a lot of chances this year, too. But I think I didn't have luck, so that's why I think I lost the (chances) for wins. I think if I play well, I feel pretty good for this week.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Song-Hee, thank you very much.
