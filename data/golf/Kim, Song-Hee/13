   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Song-Hee Kim, a third-year LPGA Tour member, you've done a fantastic job, a 9-under par 62, which is the tournament record at the CN Canadian Women's Open. You started off with 6 birdies in a row. Can you talk about how you were feeling when you were hitting those 6 birdies?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: That's what I -- the first 6 holes, I mean, I think I couldn't make all the birdie putts, even like I just try and hit it second shot on the green and make a birdie. And then I didn't know I had 6 birdies in a row, so it was awesome. I mean it was fantastic.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Great. How many greens did you hit today?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Actually, I don't know. Let me check. I think 16.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: 16 greens?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Awesome. We'll take questions for Song-Hee. Obviously this is also a career low for you.  
  
  Q. Song-Hee, obviously 62 is a fantastic round, but you had a bogey in there, and you parred the 18. Do you think 59 was possible or not really?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Well, I didn't think about even I could have shot 9-under par today, and I had like two times bogey chance, but I -- you know, I really had a good up-and-down, so I mean 9-under par is still a good score.   
  
  Q. I'll say. Tell me, was there anything from yesterday's round that might have given you a hint that you were going to play this well today?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: The biggest thing?  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Were there things.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yesterday was a lot of wind. I mean, like sometimes the wind like kind of gusts, you know. And even a lot of players couldn't make the putts, and even like even if I like -- even the ball didn't steady. So it was harder yesterday.   
 And today, I mean the weather is perfect. I think that's the biggest thing.   
  
  Q. Your game, though, have you seen this kind of a score capable from your game lately?  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Did you think that by the way you've been playing your past couple tournaments, did you think that you would be able to shoot a 9-under par sometime?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Not really. I mean I just came to U.S. like two weeks ago, and I really got tired even. So I didn't even think about I can shoot like 9-under par.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: You had been in Korea, then?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. And I come back. And then I hadn't -- I got a lot of tired.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Jet lag? From Korea.  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Most golfers, most people playing golf can't ever imagine what it's like to be 9-under par. I mean, what is it like out there? Are you thinking about how far under par you are or do you just try to stay in the moment?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I just try -- I mean the first thing, I just try and hit the ball on the fairway, and then the second thing, I just try and hit the pins and then make a putt. That's all. I mean I didn't think about, you know, I need to make more birdies. I didn't think about that?  
  
  Q. Simple game, then, right?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah?  
  
  Q. Is your family here with you?  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Is your family here?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Oh, just my mom.   
  
  Q. Does she follow you around wherever you go?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. Every time.   
  
  Q. Any other family that comes across from back home, that comes and watches you play ever? Your dad?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: My dad sometimes. But usually I'm traveling with my mom.   
  
  Q. How important is that to you, to have your mom with you? Could you imagine her not being here?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Like --  
  
  Q. What difference would that be?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Like she helped me with a lot of things, like laundry. (Laughs). Sometimes she try and wake me in the morning, like -- I mean and sometimes she cooks for me, like she cook Korean food, which is different food in Korea, so sometimes, I really like Korean food, so sometimes I want to eat, you know. And sometimes she make me good food, so that might be help.   
  
  Q. What's been the most difficult thing for you to make the jump and become a permanent LPGA player? Obviously there's other Koreans out here, so I'm sure you're comfortable with them, but what's the most difficult part about playing in North America for you?  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What was the toughest part going -- to first start playing in the U.S. on the Duramed FUTURES Tour, and now to play on the LPGA? What was the most difficult part about that?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: I think in Korea, like in Korea and here, like really different golf conditions even, and like I think most greens are really fast here, and that would be the first thing.   
 I think the second thing is food, like language, like you know.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: The whole culture.  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. Different culture.  
  
  Q. How many putts did you have today all together?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: Today. 25. Yeah. 25.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: You said there were a couple holes where you had a chance for bogey.   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: But you got up-and-down. Which holes were those?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Actually 10, 11. Well, I had a bogey on 10. 11 and 13.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What was your up-and-down? Was it a long putt or a chip-in?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: 11, I had a bogey on 10, and just kind of let it go, and I hit it right side, and then I chipped from the rough. And it was like three, four-yard par putt. It wasn't really hard. And then I made it at par.   
 And then the other one, 13. Oh, yeah. Like you know, like I hit a pretty good driver on No. 13. And then I hit an 8-iron on the right side. It was kind of edgy on the green. But I was kind of really like down and turkey putt and I had a two-putt.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: How far was the two-putt?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Like 13 yards.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: 13 yards? Okay.   
  
  Q. I count 23 players from Korea here. Why is women's golf so good in Korea? Can you explain that?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: I don't know. I think because a lot of Korean players train every year. Like you told me that 23 players are playing LPGA. You can see there are a lot of Korean players here, I think.   
 And even, you know, when we are amateurs, we have like a lot of practice every day, and I think that might be help everybody.   
  
  Q. I see you've shot some 63s in the past. Is this your first course record?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: No. This is the second time?  
  
  Q. Where is the other course record?  
 SONG-HEE KIM: It was the FUTURES Tour qualifying, and I shot 9-under par there.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Was that in 2005?   
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. Any other questions? Thank you all very much. Song-Hee, great round.
