   MIKE SCANLAN: Song-Hee, thanks for coming in. You're 5-under par, one shot off the lead in second place, just tell us how you played today. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Overall, I didn't make many mistakes today, and putting-wise, also, good. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Can you talk about being one shot off the lead entering the weekend, what's your mind-set? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: It's just the second round. So nobody can expect the result, and everybody competitor is very close right now. 

 Q. Inaudible.
 SONG-HEE KIM: I remember for the last two year, I missed some opportunities to win and I think about it will be better for me to make -- makes me very greedy to win.

 Q. Will you change your approach for tomorrow? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: As I mentioned before, it's just the second round, so I just prepare to not be very stressed or get some pressure to win. 

 Q. Are you a very calm person? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: I also have emotions, but that's just a face. 

 Q. You're not that --
 SONG-HEE KIM: I'm not like Christina Kim. (Laughter)
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thank you.
