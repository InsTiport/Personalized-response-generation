   JASON TAYLOR: Song-Hee, thanks for coming in here. You had a really good day today. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Thank you.
 JASON TAYLOR: You are 8-under today, 10-under overall. You're tied for the lead right now. If you would, just talk about your day. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Well, the first thing, the weather was perfect, and my iron shot and driver and putting, everything was coming perfect. 
 I had eight birdies today and no bogey today.
 JASON TAYLOR: Not bad. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: No. I missed only one shot on No. 18, on No. 9, but I got up-and-down.
 JASON TAYLOR: Okay. Questions? 

 Q. Is there a particular hole today that you had any particular good shot on?
 SONG-HEE KIM: I had three best shots. I almost made it two times. 
 On No. 11, it was just eight yards, and I used 57.
 DAVID POITEVENT: You landed it pin high and spun back, almost went in the hole. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. And then the other one, No. 18, par-4, it was --
 DAVID POITEVENT: 159. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: And I used 7-iron, almost made it, like this far. 

 Q. What was the third one?
 SONG-HEE KIM: Par-3, right? 
 JASON TAYLOR: Six on par-3.
 DAVID POITEVENT: Par-3, No. 5. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah.
 DAVID POITEVENT: You pulled a 9-iron, maybe two feet. 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. Two feet. 
 JASON TAYLOR: You said the weather was perfect today, and the conditions were pretty good. How did the golf course play? Was it still a little wet from all the rain? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: I think better than the other day. I mean now I think like conditions were really good, I think.
 DAVID POITEVENT: Still a little soft.
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. A little bit soft.
 JASON TAYLOR: But better than yesterday? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. Better than the other day.

 Q. Do you think you can come close to winning the tournament? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yes. I mean I'll try. I'll try the best I can. 
 JASON TAYLOR: If you win this tournament, what would it mean to you? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Because I never win on the LPGA TOUR, it's going to be the first time winning, so I would be really happy, and feels like all my life.
 JASON TAYLOR: It would feel really good? 
 SONG-HEE KIM: Yeah. 

 Q. Do you expect 10-under to be the lead at the end of the day?
 SONG-HEE KIM: I don't know, because I had a perfect day today.
 DAVID POITEVENT: It should be close, but the girls playing this afternoon, I think she understands they could shoot a good round as well. The conditions are great. So it should still be in the Top 5. But it's a great round is what she's saying. 

 Q. Is that the best for now?
 SONG-HEE KIM: On the Futures Tour, I shot 9-under for the qualifier, Futures qualifier. I shot 9-under, and that's the second time I shoot 8-under. 
 DAVID POITEVENT: Second time LPGA 8-under. So I think that ties for the best LPGA, yes. 

 Q. Once you got going, it was like every shot was a birdie. 
 DAVID POITEVENT: I would say yes. (Laughs) Every shot did it feel good over the ball today?
 SONG-HEE KIM: A couple shots I didn't feel good, but my putting was really good, so I think it was more better for putting. 

 Q. What was the longest putt you made?
 DAVID POITEVENT: Eight, she made about a 30-footer from the left side of the green. That was her longest putt, for birdie. 
 JASON TAYLOR: Any other questions? All right. Thank you, Song-Hee.
