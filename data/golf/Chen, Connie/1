Q.   Tell us about the shot you hit on 15?
CONNIE CHEN:   I didn't see it go in, none of us did.   My dad said, oh, it might have gone in, but the cameraman didn't say anything.   So he and Sandra were like, if it went in, someone would have done something.   So we only found out it went in, like maybe five meters away from the hole.   We were like, there's no ball.

Q.   What did you do? 
CONNIE CHEN:   Just went like this.

Q.   Hands in the air? 
CONNIE CHEN:   Couldn't really do anything else.

Q.   Is that your first hole‑in‑one? 
CONNIE CHEN:   No, I hit one last year in Spain.   Unfortunately it wasn't the one with the car but this year at least I got it.   Great first car. 

Q.   What are you going to do with the car? 
CONNIE CHEN:   Drive it. 

Q.   Have you got a driving license? 
CONNIE CHEN:   I do, yeah.   Hopefully it's an automatic though.

Q.   And you hit a 6‑iron? 
CONNIE CHEN:   Yeah. 

Q.   The distance?   160‑odd yards? 
CONNIE CHEN:   It was about 154 metres I think. 

Q.   Fairly decent.   And as a South African it would be remiss of me not to ask, the sad news overnight. 
CONNIE CHEN:   Well, obviously I'm sad.   He's such a great man.   I was thinking about wearing like a black ribbon today.   I thought it would‑‑ the Tour might do something, but I didn't see any on the tee box.   But hopefully we can do that tomorrow.   As all the players and everything‑‑ this, today, was for breast cancer. 

Q.   Is a black cap‑‑
CONNIE CHEN:   Yeah, black cap, black pants.
