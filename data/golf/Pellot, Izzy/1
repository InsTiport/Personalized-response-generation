Q. You're the youngest player in the field.  I know you're really close, also, with Alexa.  Tell me about what it means for you to come here, being the youngest, and does it mean anything to you?  Do you just go out there and play your game?
IZZY PELLOT: Yeah, it means a lot, also since I qualified for a 71 at Timucuan, and I was just really happy that I qualified, and now I just have to go out there and play.
Q. Is this your first girls' junior?
IZZY PELLOT: Yeah, but I have played the Women's Four-Ball.
Q. So talk me through your match a little bit today.
IZZY PELLOT: Well, it's pretty much all square, and then I chipped in for birdie, which I went 1-up, and I think -- I believe I was 1-up going through 10, and I think I went two more up, which I was 3-up.  Caroline, she birdied, and then I bogeyed one hole, so then it went to me 1-up, and I'm not sure what she got on the last hole, but that's pretty much how it went.
Q. It was just back and forth the whole time?
IZZY PELLOT: Pretty much.
Q. How did it finish?  What was the finishing hole like?  Walk me through that.
IZZY PELLOT: We were both in the fairway, and I hit an iron shot to about 10 feet, and she went left of the green, and then she chipped up, and it went past the hole -- like the edge of the green, and she didn't finish, but I think three-putt, and then I just putted, and then she gave me the putt.
Q. What do you think was the strongest part of your game today?  Were you strongest off the tees or was your putting pretty good?
IZZY PELLOT: Yeah, everything was pretty much on.
Q. Solid?
IZZY PELLOT: Yeah.
Q. What do you think the key is to this golf course?
IZZY PELLOT: Fairways and greens.
