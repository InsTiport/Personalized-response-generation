FRANK LICKLITER II:  Hit the ball really solid.  Made some nice putts.
Q.  Inaudible?
FRANK LICKLITER II:  Well, that's going to happen.  The greens are still receptive but they are drying out.
Q.  Great to birdie the last hole?
FRANK LICKLITER II:  That was nice.  I hit a nice little punch shot up there about five feet.  Still good to birdie the last hole no matter what day it is.
Q.  Great round today but this type of round in these conditions
FRANK LICKLITER II:  Well, if you hit the ball in the right spot, you can make the putt.  You can be aggressive.
Q.  Guys are talking about knowing the positions    inaudible?
FRANK LICKLITER II:  Yeah, absolutely.
Q.  What will you do after the round now, work out or go to the range?
FRANK LICKLITER II:  I'll hit a few balls, a few iron shots.
