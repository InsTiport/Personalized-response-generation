 Q.   I don't know if it helps, but I think a lot of people are feeling your pain.  
MARC WARREN:   Yeah, it's going to be a long drive home tonight.   It's something I'll be missing out, the Open.   I'm a little bit disappointed not only missing out on The Scottish Open but the Open as well.  
   
 Q.   You looked to be cruising.   
MARC WARREN:   It was feeling that way.   The way I played yesterday and the way I played today, I was flawless out there.   Every hole I was in the right position off the tee, right shot on to the green and then one shot, really‑‑ I hit a bad 3‑wood off the tee and ended up in quite a smelly lie and couldn't quite get to the bottom of the ball but managed a decent position and 3‑putted from about 15 feet.   
It was all a bit of a shock to the system and maybe lost concentration next team.  
   
 Q.   You had a delay on the next tee, as well.   
MARC WARREN:   Yeah, we walked off, and when I was looking at my second shot, I was conscious I was taking a lot of time and actually I apologised to SÃ¸ren Kjeldsen, because I walked back two or three times to get my line for where I was trying to land the second shot to run on the green.   
It was even more disappointing going to the next tee and we are still on the tee, and being a short par 4, you can drive the green.   That was a little bit of a disappointment, and just tried to keep my drive on the right‑hand side there and ended up in an unplayable lie and was only five or six yards right of where I was aiming.   
   
 Q.   Does devastated cover it?   
MARC WARREN:   I'm sure it will, at some point.   Not quite yet.   A load of positives this week.   You don't have many chances to win your own National Open.   
   
 Q.   What about in a year's time?  
MARC WARREN:   Hopefully.   I'll take that position again and I'll definitely finish it better next time.  
   
 Q.   Hopefully you can bounce back and cling on to the positives?  
MARC WARREN:   Aye.   Will do.
