 Q.  A little disappointed to bogey the last but 68 at Carnoustie is never a bad score, is it?  
MARC WARREN: Yes, absolutely.  Even though the weather has been very kind to us this morning, still a very tough golf course.   
Bogeyed the last like you said, just shows you how tough it is.  I was about two yards out on my tee shot and got in a tricky lie, got over the back of the green.  Thought I hit a good chip and a good putt but ended up making five.  Played the last two holes 1-over par, you'd probably take that every time.   
 Q.  Some players say they feel the weight of expectation in front of home fans.  You were fourth at The Scottish Open and at the Paul Lawrie; looks like you're inspired by playing in Scotland?  
MARC WARREN: Must be a bit of breakfast or something like that.  Home comforts are great and friend and family watching get you going.  I really enjoy it and seem to save some of my best golf for Scotland.   
 Q.  How nice to play a different format?  
MARC WARREN: Played a few holes with Paul Lawrie and played with him in the third round of The Open, second to last group and just talking about how different it was.  It's actually nice to be a bit more relaxed about it, and playing some of the best golf courses you'll ever get.  It's very relaxed and when the weather is kind to us, it's even more so and even more enjoyable.
