  Q. Your assessment of the day?   
 MARC WARREN: It was a good day. Played solid again. Not quite as good as yesterday but very good. Just wasn't comfortable over the putter all day. Didn't hole putts. Otherwise it would have been a few better.  
  
  Q. Were you surprised that you're still up second?   
 MARC WARREN: It's tough out there. It's tough going. It's not easy to make birdies. I wouldn't say I'm surprised.   
  
  Q. Is it an advantage having finished and having a later tee time?  
 MARC WARREN: It was ideal this morning actually because I was shattered when I got up this morning. Last night I couldn't sleep. I was just tired. Woke up and I was just shattered and was quite happy to see it was delayed. Went back to bed and I was refreshed, ready to go.   
 Out there today, I was trying not to look at this as a means to an end type thing and just look at it as a stepping stone to better things, as well, toward the end of the year. It's good to feel that way coming out and it's there or thereabouts and if it's not, I know what to do, whereas before, it was trying to piece together a jigsaw every day.   
 Definitely I feel it's much better but whatever happens this weekend would be great obviously.
