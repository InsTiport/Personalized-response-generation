That wasn't quite so eventful as yesterday. Made quite a few birdies but made some mistakes as well. Bogeyed the tenth, which was my first, but got it back and had it nine under at the turn. Unfortunately I bogeyed the first and second, went in the water on the second.  But from there played solid and happy enough.  It was nice to get round in under par today.

The smog this morning was incredible. You hit your tee shots and couldn't see you ball land. You could see the ball to about 200 yards and after that is was guesswork. I have never experienced that here. Fortunately the sun broke through and it was a nice day. It was really calm and ideal for scoring. The greens were a little softer and must have been some dew. The course is tough but a few more chances today than yesterday. I am in a nice position. Two rounds to go and looking forward to a good weekend.
