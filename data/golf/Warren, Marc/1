  Q. When you walked off 16 with eagle, what are you thinking?
 MARC WARREN:   Just keep going, really.  The way I played, especially the back nine, I bogeyed 9.  Poor tee shot there.  Kind of anywhere left of that flag is a good shot and just missed it right and from then on I had a look at the scoreboard on 10 and obviously Aaron was playing great.  So just kind of keeping on his coattails, and to finish, you know, that strong over the last six, seven holes, very proud.
 Q. Not many under par after yesterday?
 MARC WARREN:   Yeah, playing Thursday morning, I felt was the suffer side of the draw, as well.  Really happy with my round Thursday, and yesterday was just a battle for everyone.  Then obviously today, you try to not get carried away, going for too many flags or too many birdies, because the conditions were perfect out this.
 Q. How important was the win in Austria?
 MARC WARREN:   Yeah, if I had not been Austria I wouldn't be playing this week.  That in itself shows you how important it was.  That was a massive turning point for me, like everyone, six months off, and I felt like I used the time wisely.  Got my game in good shape and proved that in Austria with a win and obviously another good week here.
 Q. Nice to perform well in your home championship?
 MARC WARREN:   Always, especially Renaissance has been incredible this week.  Again, the weather has been rough on the golf course, and you know, then maybe not seen it at its finest.  Monday and Tuesday, the golf course was incredible and obviously the rain we had.  But again, from Aberdeen Standard, VisitScotland, the Renaissance, have done a put on a great shot this week.
