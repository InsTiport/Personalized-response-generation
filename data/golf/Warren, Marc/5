Q. Thoughts on the 66?
MARC WARREN: Got off to the ideal start.  Started on 10 and made birdie there and birdied 11, as well.  You know, was 3-under after four, so really, it was the perfect start after kind of seven or eight weeks off.
Q. Give us the importance of that start in terms of momentum for the round?
MARC WARREN: Yeah, exactly.  You're kind of going into the round and the tournament expecting a little bit of rust to be there.  It's a little bit of, kind of give it a hit and see how it goes, really.  I've been working hard leading up to this event the last couple weeks, and it was nice to get off to the ideal start today.
Q. Give us a few highlights apart from the start.
MARC WARREN: Yeah, I holed a good putt on 8, after missing a really good chance at 7.  That was kind of 15-, 20-foot maybe, actually.  Quite a bit of left-to-right break downhill.  It was nice to see that one go in.
Also I would say probably 11 was good.  Second hole of the day, I had it in the fairway bunker off the tee.  I hit a really good second shot to about 15 foot and holed that one in.
Getting off to a good start, feel as if momentum on your side straightaway is good.
Q. What does that do for the confidence going into the rest of the week?
MARC WARREN: Yeah, I felt as though I finished the season last year pretty strongly and got off to a good start again today.  Just proves that what I've been doing the last couple weeks, what I've been working on, is hopefully going to take me in the right direction.  Just keep doing what I'm doing, and like I said, you're going to expect over three or four days, there's going to be a little bit of rust shown at some point.  Just a matter of staying patient when that does happen.
