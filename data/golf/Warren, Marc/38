Q.   The score suggests a nice day but plenty are shooting lower.   Mixed feelings? 
MARC WARREN:   No, I was pretty pleased with my day overall.   No bogeys today, which was good.   Shows you putting game is in good shape.   Four birdies, could have been a few more.   Didn't really take advantage of the par 5s. 
But yeah, overall really pleased with another good round.

Q.   It's not bad for a Saturday, is it, moving day, being in that kind of position into the final round? 
MARC WARREN:   Yeah, exactly, I think I'm three or four back, so definitely attainable.   Form is obviously good, so looking forward to another good Sunday tomorrow.

Q.   On a day that you see there are opportunities, players have shot 63,64, some of the pins are kinder probably? 
MARC WARREN:   I think the pins were actually quite tricky today.   One or two were kind of‑‑ I think with the greens being soft, it gives you a chance to go at the flags.   I think if you're playing later on, the greens might get a few footprints.   A couple of putts definitely at the end thought I holed and just kind of veered away at the last second and that can happen later in the day.   If you are out early in the morning, the greens are better.   You go on a roll, you can shoot 7‑ or 8‑under which a few of the guys have done this morning.   This isn't an easy golf course and has to be respected.   Like I said, really pleased with 4‑under today.

Q.   You had Jamie Donaldson today, Ryder Cup bound, any appreciation of how he's playing? 
MARC WARREN:   He's in good form, as usual, as he has been the last few years.   Yeah, I think he'll be more than ready to go this time next week.

Q.   What do you need from the final day? 
MARC WARREN:   Something mid to low 60s I would think.   If the conditions are the same as they are, I would say 65, at worst, I would say.
