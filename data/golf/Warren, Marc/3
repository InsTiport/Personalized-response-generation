 Q.  Pleased with that?  
MARC WARREN: Very good, following on from 67 yesterday.  Really good weekend and pulled my through the field to have another strong finish.   
 Q.  What is it about this tournament for you?  
MARC WARREN: Yeah, well, first and foremost, I love links golf, and the Old Course is my favourite course anywhere in the world.  You know, it's just a pleasure to play, especially the weather we've had this week, we've been very lucky again.  We get spoiled at this event every year, so it's nice to perform and play well.   
 Q.  What's the key today?  
MARC WARREN: I drove the ball well again, so hitting a lot of the fairways, the right side of the fairways, I was able to go at quite a few flags.  The back nine was playing a lot tougher today than it was yesterday, so coming in, quite a few long putts but managed to get them outside the hole and didn't have too much pressure on myself.   
Bogey-free day to today is always good on a Sunday.   
 Q.  57th in the rankings coming into this event, so some good Race to Dubai points.  
MARC WARREN: Yeah, absolutely.  It's been a good few week, couple weeks leading into this event.  Hopefully the form continues.
