 Q.  Your verdict for today? 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: I think we played well again today. Marc and I drove the ball well and in foursomes, you need to put the ball in the fairway and that was key for us today and 68 we would have taken that at the start of the day. We've come out of that and we're right in contention. We're doing okay. 

 Q.  Was it a different feeling playing in a tougher format today? 
 MARC WARREN: Yeah, there is always more pressure on you because your ball is going to be the one that counts and that's it. You have the mindset to try not to hit a bad shot but a good shot. But I think with six birdies in a tough format like this around this golf course, it's a positive. 

 Q.  Is it difficult to maintain your rhythm when you're playing alternate shots all the time? 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE: Oh certainly. Sometimes, you don't have a drive in three or four holes and suddenly, you have to hit a good one. Like the last hole here, you can put this hole on any course. It's fantastic. It's a demanding tee shot and after a couple of holes where you don't hit a drive, you think 'oh my God." Marc walked too far up the hill and I said 'oh no, I hope I hit the fairway here or he'll have to walk back again. 

 Q. Any particular highlight that you can say about your partner today? 
 MARC WARREN: We both played solid today. We both hit the fairways when it was needed and some good solid shots and were solid on the greens in this format. 

 Q.  It was another case of good teamwork? 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  Pretty much so. As I said, Marc hit the fairways and if we keep doing that for the next two days, we'll be okay. 

 Q.  I take it that you're in a good position going into the weekend? 
 COLIN MONTGOMERIE:  We are indeed.
