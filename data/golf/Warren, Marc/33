 Q.   Good start after last week?   
MARC WARREN:   Yes, absolutely.   Last week was a good week but kind of you want to look forward all the time as a golfer.   There's always another tournament to play.   This is a massive tournament for us and it's around a great golf course.   It's presented absolutely immaculately.   A very good start, and any time you shoot in the mid 60s you've got to be very pleased.  
   
 Q.   With the Desert Swing you can get into a nice rhythm on similar styles of courses?  
MARC WARREN:   Yeah, definitely.   It was kind of strange with last week's event finishing on the Saturday and then this obviously on a regular Thursday.   Feel as if we've been here a long time.   Took Sunday off and done very little on Monday to ease myself into the week.   It would be pretty easy to over‑practice.  
I didn't really do an awful lot on Tuesday.   Just went out and played five holes and took it pretty easy and then the Pro‑Am yesterday.  
   
 Q.   Sounds like you felt the benefit of having that extra day off to reflect on the previous week and recharge?  
MARC WARREN:   Yeah, it's always nice when you have a really good week, it's kind of nice to reflect on it and enjoy it and soak it in a little bit and try to take as many positives as you possibly can.   Hopefully carry some of those into this week.  
   
 Q.   Enjoy the Emirates Course and Dubai as a whole?   
MARC WARREN:   Yes, I do.   Seem to play nothing but great events out here in the whole of the Middle East.   This one and obviously the end of the year, you want to be a part of, and obviously it helps a little bit if you've played some good golf, too.
