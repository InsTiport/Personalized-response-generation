Q.   Tough match out there today for you?
    MARC WARREN:   Yeah, it was.   I think it's fair to say neither of us were at our best today.   I think I was probably a little more solid on the greens. 

Q.   Your first trip around Harding Park, what did you think of it?
    MARC WARREN:   Yeah, it's a great golf course, and the rough is very juicy.   If you've got a possession it can really test you.   I think that was probably the key to the game today. 
    Both of us weren't great off the tee, but like I said, fortunately maybe I was just a little bit tighter around the greens.
