Q. What do you take from a second round 69, 2-under?
MARC WARREN: Yeah I was really pleased.  I drove the ball really well today.  Obviously the golf course is really tree-lined here so first and foremost, you have to get in play off the tee, and early start in morning, the course is playing really long, as well.  To get around, missed a few chances, but overall pleased with a 69.
Q. Do you feel this golf course suits your game and suits your eye?
MARC WARREN: Yeah, my form's been pretty good of late.  It's a golf course, obviously played last year.  I knew a bit about it and felt as if I could play -- I'm obviously playing well and I felt as if I could continue that form here.  So far, it's been a really good two days.
Q. What's been the key to your recent good form?
MARC WARREN: I would say driving the ball has been really good.  Then obviously on the greens, I've been holing putts when I need to.  I've had two Top 10s the last three weeks and a 15th at the British Masters.  Form is good.  This time of year, it's nice to be looking forward and trying to qualify for Race to Dubai, etc.
So you know, nothing to worry about at the weekend apart from going to try and shoot as low a score as I can.
