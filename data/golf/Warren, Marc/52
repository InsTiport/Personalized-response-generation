  MARC WARREN:   Yeah, very pleased.   Felt yesterday as if practice went great.   Felt like yesterday I just got in my own way a little bit and tried to be a little bit too perfect I suppose.   Then today, just focused on one swing thought.   I think I was sixth in greens out there, so on a golf course like this, you have to be pretty pleased with that.  
   
 Q.   Pretty tough conditions out there, especially early on?  
MARC WARREN:   Yeah, the fairways, we were out there for a good 2 1/2 hours or something and we had only played about four holes.   It was just one of those days.   Obviously a tough course, and the rain as well.   
Yeah, I hung in there well.   Like I said, ball‑striking is great.   Birdied the first, which is a perfect start.   When it's so tough, at least you can get something that you can hang on to.   Yeah, just stayed patient and hit a lot of good shots.  
   
 Q.   Any particular highlights in there?   
MARC WARREN:   The 6‑iron at the first actually, because the rain was quite heavy at that point, and the flag was tucked in over the bunker, and I just hit a lovely draw there to about six or eight feet.   So that got me off to an ideal start.
