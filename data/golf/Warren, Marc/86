   MARC WARREN: I hadn't won a point until today so it was on my shoulders to go out and prove a point today and I think I did that. I holed a good 6-footer on the 17th for a half and a four footer on the last for a win. I think the matches have been so tight up until now but I hope we are looking at a victory. 
 The second half of my season has been great. To win in Scotland and be selected for this match is a great honour. I did watch Golf Night and I was raging! It was the spark we needed on the range. It got Paul and Monty and me fired up. To say Monty and Paul Casey had no chance is nonsense. They said the first three was a definite no-go for GB & I so they set themselves up for a fall. I think we went out and proved out point by winning the top three singles. I didn't want to come away without contributing. Both Monty and myself.
