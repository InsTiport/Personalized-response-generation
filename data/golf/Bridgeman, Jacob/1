Q. Heck of a comeback for you.
JACOB BRIDGEMAN: Uh-huh.
Q. How did you do it?
JACOB BRIDGEMAN: Well, lost the 1st hole, lost the 2nd hole.
Q. Yep.  You were three-down at one point.
JACOB BRIDGEMAN: I was three-down and never saw up.  Started really rough.  Tons of respect for his game.  I hit it way by him, but he is dialed in with his long irons; really good putter.
I made seven birdies today, and obviously won 1-up in extra holes.  He's a really good player.
Q. How did you birdie 15 and 17?
JACOB BRIDGEMAN: 15 I hit a clutch 6-iron to about two feet.
17 I hit driver, 3-wood to the front edge like short and chipped it up to about five feet.
Q. Last week you played well.  Did that give you a lot confidence coming in here?
JACOB BRIDGEMAN: It did for sure did.  Before that week I was playing really bad, and found something the day before and kind of rode it and it worked and it's still working, so I'm just going to keep going with it.
Q. Something in the water down in Inman with you and Phillips?
JACOB BRIDGEMAN: There definitely is.  We have been good buddies since we were infants, so, yeah, two of us coming out of a small town is pretty special.
Q. When you come from behind in a situation like this, how much confidence do you get as you go along here?
JACOB BRIDGEMAN: I mean, it gives you -- if you're down in another match it gives you hope because you know you can do it.  Just like winning any other match:  you got to do it.
