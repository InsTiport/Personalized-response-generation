 Q. So early on you were in the lead for the first couple of holes there, did you look up at the scoreboard and notice you were up at the top?  
TAKUMI KANAYA: It was like a dream come true to start birdie, birdie and see your name on the board. It was pretty neat.   
   
 Q. How did you feel on this first day?  
TAKUMI KANAYA: Compared to the practice rounds I felt nervous my first tee. I pulled it left, made a good second shot into the green and able to make birdie. But, no, I was very nervous.  
   
 Q. How do you deal with the nerves?  
TAKUMI KANAYA: There's many holes that you're really nervous hitting the shot. I pushed my tee shot right on 11, but I was able to get through the holes.  
   
 Q. What is your target for this week?  
TAKUMI KANAYA: I want to play good enough that I can make the cut and be able to get the low amateur.  
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
TAKUMI KANAYA: Only amateurs get to stay there, and so I think it was a good memory to have for later.  
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
TAKUMI KANAYA: We took a picture together.  
   
 Q. Tell me what happened on 17 and how long was the putt on No.1?  
TAKUMI KANAYA: In the middle of the fairway, and just hit it long and unloaded at the bottom, and had two chips and two putts and double bogey.   
   
 Q. No.1, how long was the the putt?  
TAKUMI KANAYA: 24 feet.
