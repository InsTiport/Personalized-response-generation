Q. So the timing of that delay you had the chip coming up and you knew you needed to get up‑and‑down for par to make the cut. How, what was going through your mind during the delay in anticipation of coming back out here?
TAKUMI KANAYA: I knew I just had to do what I had to do and so I had a good vision or image of that shot in my head and I went to it. 

Q. And then the putt itself, was that the biggest knee knocker you've ever had?
TAKUMI KANAYA: It was only a three‑foot putt, but, yes, I was very, very nervous.

Q. So you had an up‑and‑down round today but came back strong at the end. What do you take away from this round going into the weekend?
TAKUMI KANAYA: No, I learned that you just never give up. I had it to 4‑over for the day, 5 total, but I was able to get two back and towards the end there and so what I'm going to take away from this is that you just never give up.
