Q. Congratulations on your round. Six birdies, tell us about how you accomplished that?
TAKUMI KANAYA: I wanted to be aggressive, a little bit different from yesterday and I was able to get those birdies.

Q. Amateur golf here at Augusta is very important, created by Bobby Jones. Four amateurs have made the cut. How important is it to you to win the title of low amateur?
TAKUMI KANAYA: Definitely one of the highest honors an amateur could get here at Augusta. There's many amateurs here that have turned up major champions on the Tour. So, yeah, definitely that's my goal. 

Q. What will you do between now and tomorrow when it's your turn to tee it up again? What will you do to get ready to try and win the title of low amateur at the Masters?
TAKUMI KANAYA: I will prepare the best way I can for tomorrow. And if I can play my game I think the results will be there. So I just have to go out there and do that.
