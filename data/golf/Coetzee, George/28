Q.   George, they never come easy.   How were you able to survive and advance in this extra hole match against Patrick?
GEORGE COETZEE:   I don't know.   I don't know, I got through the first extra hole and, I don't know, he got me to the second extra hole.   But it was a seesaw kind of battle.   It was a proper boxing match, took a couple of bruises, but I did get through.

Q.   How does your mindset change, how does your approach change, when you are trying to make something happen, but as you said maybe not playing your best golf?
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, not even close to the best golf.   You try and stay out of trouble.   I mean, I try to make no silly errors.   If I have a chance to hit the green, try and make sure I hit the green.   If it's a tough shot, try and miss it on the right side.   I made good decisions when it comes to that, but execution might not have been as good.
