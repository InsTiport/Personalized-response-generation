Q.   What are your thoughts at the halfway stage in this championship in a nice position, once again?
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, obviously just want to be in the mix come Sunday. 

Q.   Scorecard suggested there was a lot to be had in the early stages of your round today. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, I'm playing well.   Swing is coming along slightly and putting pretty nicely.   Just got to wait for my birdies and not force it and kind of play the golf course like I know it.

Q.   Did you fancy there might be an exceptionally low score the way you started? 
GEORGE COETZEE:   No, not the way I was playing, but definitely feels like there's a low number to be had out there today because I played well‑‑ still 5‑under, so if someone has a good day they could maybe go 62 today.

Q.   Some players are talking about rust; I don't think there's any for any South Africans in the field. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   I had my fair share.   I didn't touch the clubs over Christmas.   We had a few events and feel the rust is off and we can just play golf. 

Q.   The nature of this course, we see you play pretty well on a desert track?
GEORGE COETZEE:   I just like the vibe and the way the course gels into the land they have it on.   It's just a fun golf course.
