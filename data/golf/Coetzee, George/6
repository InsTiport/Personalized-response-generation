 Q.  George, on a day you needed a really good round to get yourself in the mix, how does it feel to get it with a 65?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, that was kind of it out there.  Straight off the blocks, can't get much going the first couple holes but finished strongly on the front nine with a couple birdies and an eagle which gave me the momentum to come and play freely and pick up a couple extra shots on the back nine.   
 Q.  1-over through six, and then 7-under for the next eight.  What sparked the run?  Anything in particular gave you that momentum?  
GEORGE COETZEE: I was hitting decent shots.  I just wasn't making any putts.  I just tried to focus on being a little freer with the stroke and making better strokes, and I guess just built momentum up.   
 Q.  You've lost a lot of weight and you look terrific.  How have you lost it, and does it change the way you feel about your golf swing?  Some people lose weight and their swing feels different.  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I'm hoping to lose my swing.  That was the plan from the beginning.   
No, it's just been kind of a balanced lifestyle.  Just training better, eating better and doing better in general.   
 Q.  How excited about the opportunity for tomorrow because you're in the mix now?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, it's nice.  I missed out on the Rolex Series events this year and it's nice to be in the mix.
