 Q.   Inaudible.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   I mean, I kept playing positive and it just didn't click.   I don't think either of us played particularly well.   Most of the day I think both of us could have done much better.   Good job to Rory for finishing it off at the end.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   I'm hoping to come back strong next time.   
   
 Q.   Talk about 17.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   I wanted to hole it.   I was trying to hole it in my head.   It was helpful, but not helpful enough.   
   
 Q.   You seem very calm.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   I think it took me about four holes.   The first couple of holes, I felt a little like rubbish.   There is nothing you can do about it now, but just go back and look at it.
