Q.   What's the verdict on round three?
GEORGE COETZEE:   It was a bit of a battle.   I think I fought pretty well with a couple of birdies.

Q.   Certainly a battle you've come through and you find yourself in a very decent position. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, luckily no one kind of ran away with it because I didn't think I had it out there today and I wouldn't have been able to keep up. 
Just to be in the mix; two shots back, one day to go, it's kind of where you want to be.

Q.   Not what you wanted but does it still give the satisfaction, because you know that you've come through the test? 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, that was quite brutal.   But yeah, I'm very happy just to get out and post a score.   I kind of didn't feel it this morning on the range, and was a bit of a‑‑ I knew it was going to be a long, hard day, but luckily I fought through it. 

Q.   Excited to be in this position with a chance to win?
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yes, this is part of the plan hopefully. 

Q.   What is the approach?   You are a proven winner on The European Tour. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, it's nice that you can say that.   Yeah, not to force it.   Kind of the same game plan as today.   Give myself hopefully a few more chances and a few better chances. 

Q.   Do you draw on that victory?
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yes, definitely.   I made a good push.
