Q.   Two rounds, no dropped shots and you were eight under through 17 holes today.   The game is in pretty good shape it would appear?
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yes, it seems so.   I kind of knew I was bogey‑free and tried to keep it that way.   That's the goal of match play is not giving holes away.   And if you make a bogey, certainly don't make a double.   Today was fun.   We had a good game. 

Q.   How did conditions compare today with yesterday? 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Pretty similar.   Maybe a little bit more breeze‑y but the golf course, it's setup pretty well.

Q.   You probably need tomorrow to go to the quarterfinals and you're playing Thongchai, a guy with a fantastic match‑play pedigree. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   I think I'm playing Francesco tomorrow.   He played Ryder Cup.   All of these guys are good and I just have to play my game. 

Q.   Would be nice to get through the knockout stages‑‑
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, that's the goal, just to get to the next round.
