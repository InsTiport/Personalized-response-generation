 Q.   A lovely finish.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, I'm grateful for the little rain delay we had, just to kind of recuperate and get my thoughts together after those three bogeys in a row.   But it was an interesting day.   I'm quite happy.   I didn't expect to be able to shoot these kind of scores when I stepped on to the tee on the first when the wind was blazing and it looked like rain was coming but luckily the weather held up all right for the day.  
   
 Q. Were you raging when the bogeys happened?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   I wouldn't say raging.   I just haven't played a stroke-play event since the Masters and kind of didn't know what to do with it.   I know I had to kind of get in a positive frame of mind.   I don't think there's nothing funny going on.   I just needed to somehow stop it and I think the rain delay helped.  
   
 Q. I know it's history now but you didn't get the preparation that would have been ideal last week, because you won your match -- got through to a playoff.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, that wasn't ideal, but at least I got to play a bit.   I got a good confidence boost from the second round match against Shane Lowry.   Played really well that day and unfortunately fell out in the playoff but I still felt like I was playing good golf and I was looking forward to this week.  
   
 Q. How was it out here weather-wise?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   I would say 50/50.  
   
 Q. You've had a mix of everything.  
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, hopefully some sun tomorrow, maybe some heat but that's highly unlikely.
