 Q.   Where were you watching, on TV?   
    GEORGE COETZEE:   I was in the tournament office.  
   
 Q.   I guess pretty disappointing but when somebody does that on the last to win?  
    GEORGE COETZEE:   No, he deserves it.   He did well and he played well all week, and it's always good if you can hold the lead on Sunday because it's very difficult.   I thought to myself, all I have to do is get past 15 and make him shoot a number, and luckily for him, he did.   
   
 Q.   Both of you are in quite similar positions in that you've come close to winning a few times now, but I suppose only one person could win?  
    GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, I came off the course and I said it's quite funny that it's me and Wood going up against each other.   He's been playing well over the last couple of years and he definitely deserves it.  
   
 Q.   Where is next for you now?   
    GEORGE COETZEE:   Joburg Open.
