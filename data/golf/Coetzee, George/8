 Q.  George, 65 today, how was it?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, a little frustrated, actually, coming down the back nine.  But the front nine was quite special.  It was nice to be playing like I did.   
 Q.  What happened on 9?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Just a stock 3-wood.  Tried to convince myself just to commit, and I didn't think about left and right.  Just hit it as straight as you can.  Hit it front edge and holed a really nice, long putt.  So it was quite a nice little momentum booster.   
 Q.  Obviously the rain is coming now.  You might not be too far off coming the end of the day.  
GEORGE COETZEE: I don't know, I feel like I probably should have picked up a couple more but then again -- make a move tomorrow.   
 Q.  What is the plan tomorrow?  Aggressive from the start?  
GEORGE COETZEE: No, that was the plan today.  I was very frustrated after three holes, and then when I finally said, let's just wait for the opportunities, they started to come much quicker.  Yeah, hopefully some more of that tomorrow.
