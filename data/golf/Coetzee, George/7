 Q.  After bogeying the first, it was pretty good after that, wasn't it?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, a little rust I think just on the first hole.  I started hitting some good shots off the bat on the second, and had to wait a little bit to make a good putt.  But when I finally made one, the momentum just started building.   
 Q.  What pleased you about your play today?  
GEORGE COETZEE: I stayed calm after the bogey on first and kind of plugged away at it.  A lot of good shots, and all in all, a decent day.   
 Q.  Did you feel a good round coming into the week?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, my golf's been good, really good, the last couple of weeks.  Last week I got a bit of a cold and I wasn't in the mix much but hopefully this week, it will be better.   
 Q.  Can you take anything from this round going into the rest of the week?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, that I'm playing well.
