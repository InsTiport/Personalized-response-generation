Q. A great 63 out there today; how was it?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, happy with the score.  A couple of niggles actually while I was playing that weren't that good, but had the opportunities when they came, and we were able to post a pretty good number.
Q. Walk us through your birdies on 1 and 2.
GEORGE COETZEE: I think I made like a 50-footer on the first hole, so never looked like making birdie there, but a nice putt, and then a couple good shots on the second hole, and then I don't remember what hole the par-5 is up there, but I hit a pretty good 2-iron into a couple of feet and got the eagle, so it was nice to get momentum early.
Q. Must be quite good obviously just having one bogey today on quite a tough course out there.
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, that bogey, geez.  No comment.
Q. But all in all, a good day, great crowds out there, as well?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, we were discussing it all the way around.  It's amazing how many people came out today.  We were wondering if they had to pay people or the tickets were free, but it was quite fun having that many people here on a Thursday.
Q. Obviously a course that suits your eye, as well?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I quite enjoy it.  It's obviously quite hilly, quite a tough walk, but I enjoy playing it.
