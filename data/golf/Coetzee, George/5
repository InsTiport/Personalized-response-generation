 Q.  A nice 69 opening, how was that for you?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I didn't play that well but I made a lot of putts, so it was nice.   
 Q.  Any particular holes you thought you played really well today?  
GEORGE COETZEE: The last hole.  Made a birdie there.  It was a bit of a scramble.  The birdies were nice, good shots, and I made good putts.  The rest was a bit of a struggle.   
 Q.  Quite windy conditions.  Is that affecting everything?  
GEORGE COETZEE: I'm hoping so.  I hope it's not me and it's the wind.  You can't really say.  It's definitely trickier with this wind.  It's a totally different wind than I think most of the guys are used to playing on this golf course.  Most of them are quite long, but it was a long golf course today.  I think the wind is supposed to change tomorrow.   
 Q.  If you're not particularly happy with the way you played, are you happy with the score you ended up?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, the way I played doesn't matter as long as I score well.
