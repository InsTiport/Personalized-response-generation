 Q.   Playing against the world No. 5, imagine that halve feels very good?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   I thought he was going to finish it on 17 when he had a birdie putt but luckily for me he missed it.   I hit my shot a bit right and I thought, he's not going to give two putts and just try to make four and not three, he doesn't, and luckily enough he didn't.   
   
 Q.   Talk about that putt and the sort of pressure you're feeling over it.   You've played well and four birdies and no bogeys, and if you miss that putt, it's all been for nothing.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, but that's golf.   Like I wasn't too stressed because I felt like I played well and I feel like I'm playing well so I've got two more games.   If I was to stay here, it probably might have been a different situation.   But I just talked to myself, just hit it on line and make sure you've got it on the right line and hopefully it will go in.  
   
 Q.   What was your attitude coming in?   You were a late replacement for Thomas BjÃ¶rn.   What was your thinking coming?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   A bit of a dark horse I guess.   I was maybe going to go to South Africa to play a Sunshine Tour event but when I got the call I was obviously excited and nice to be here and nothing to lose.   
   
 Q.   Your record in match play singles is fairly mixed.   So how do you enjoy this form of the game?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, my record in match play, I've been playing against No.1s and No.2s in the world every time I get into a match‑play event.   
I enjoy match play.   Used to be my favourite format.   I actually had to kind of change my game to start playing a bit of stroke play and obviously it takes a knock on the Match Play, but yeah, it's nice to have a couple of events here to play a bit of match play and hopefully regain some of the amateur form.  
   
 Q.   A word on the course and the setup and how you found things out there today?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   It's lovely.   The greens are great.   The fairways are amazing condition considering the amount of rain they had and I think everybody is enjoying it out there.
