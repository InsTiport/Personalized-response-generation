  Q. Take me through this weekend, a very, very tidy couple of day, isn't it.   
 GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, up-and-downs this week. I putted absolutely horrendous the first two days and ended up finishing birdie, birdie and made a 15-footer on the last to make the cut on the number. Started putting well but hitting it worse. That's always a good sign when you hit it worse, usually putt better. And I've got a lot of patience for bad ball striking and I've got no patience for bad putting.  
 Today I left about five or six 10-footers out there, and I mean, that's part of the game, but I'll take my score.  
  
  Q. With the greatest respect, we kind of ignored you yesterday, because Hennie Otto had done when you had done, finished with a birdie to make the cut, and then he shot 63. So yours was in the shadows a little?  
 GEORGE COETZEE: I've been chasing him all the way. I know he shot a great score yesterday and obviously I was trying to play as well as I can and try to catch up with all of the South Africans what are ahead of me this week. We'll have to see where I finish.  
  
  Q. Presumably now that you're in this kind of position, you'd have thought you'd chase whatever you could today, but suddenly are right up there.   
 GEORGE COETZEE: I'm two or three behind what was necessary. Barring a miracle, 18-under is probably not going to be enough. But it's a good week and I'm happy.   
  
  Q. It is a payday, and points that you would not have expected on the second day.   
 GEORGE COETZEE: I was slipping outside of the top hundred in the world and hopefully this finish will get me back inside.   
 After the first two days, making the cut on the number, anything in the Top-50 would have been great for me but hopefully I think it should be a Top-10 and that's always a good result.
