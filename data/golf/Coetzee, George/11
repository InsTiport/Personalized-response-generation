Q. How was it out there?
GEORGE COETZEE: I'm quite happy with the total I had, playing the back nine -- the scoring holes, a couple of holes playing downwind.  Quite happy to have taken advantage of it.
Q. What are the keys to playing in conditions like this?
GEORGE COETZEE: Make lots of birdies.  I guess you can make putts -- it's just a question of being patient.
Q. When they called play, was it the right decision?  Balls moving on the green?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, just before that, we saw this one tree go down -- you get a warning from the chairman, it's about to collapse and start squeaking.  I was walking under the trees hearing the squeaking and thinking, this could be me.  It's a little bit dangerous out there with the trees collapsing and stuff.  Well, hopefully tomorrow will be better.
