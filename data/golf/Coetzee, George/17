GEORGE COETZEE: I said it yesterday, it felt like everything was just pretty average.   
Today I think pretty much the driving and the putting went from average to pretty good.  Hit some really nice tee shots out there and gave myself chances for birdies.   
 Q.  What do you think changed that feel?  
GEORGE COETZEE: I went out on the range and golfed a little bit.  I got home at 8:30 last night, so put some work in last night and it paid off today.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GEORGE COETZEE: I knew that from my travels.  I needed about two more birdies, just to get 623, and tried to sneak one more.  I made the birdie, but 18 is not that kind of hole, you can't plan that kind of hole.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GEORGE COETZEE: I don't know, hopefully just keep doing the same thing, stick to the same game plan and hopefully it pays off the next two days.
