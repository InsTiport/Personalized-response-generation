 Q.   I'm sure it's a stupid question, but how important were those two birdies to close?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, I guess that's very important.   I couldn't find the cup today.   But felt my putting was okay after the first five or six or seven holes, it wasn't too good.   But once I made the putt on nine, I started putting a little better.   It's very important to get those two to stay in contention.   
   
 Q.   Sounds like it's been a deeply frustrating day.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   I think only maybe once or twice I felt like this, it's driving me up the wall.   But I told myself, the best way to get over it is to wait for it and luckily it came just in time.  
   
 Q.   Am I right that the wind as much as anything is to blame?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   No, no.   It was more of a rhythm.   I felt I hit the ball much better today than both the first two days.   I think I just put too much pressure on my putting.   
   
 Q.   Have you stolen a look at that leaderboard, it's so congested, you're in a lovely position.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, I think me and Rafa missed an opportunity today, because if we had just pushed each other a bit, we could have pulled away.   Don't want to play too early.
