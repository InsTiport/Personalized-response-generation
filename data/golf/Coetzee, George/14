GEORGE COETZEE: Quite happy with the round today.  Had to be very patient out there.  But felt like I was playing well, so it was a little easier to be patient.
Q. You said yesterday that you were still happy, despite falling backwards.  Has this really restored all the faith in your game after shooting a low one again?
GEORGE COETZEE: The back nine made me feel better except for obviously the 10th hole.  I'm hitting it nicely, putting it good.  Just got to see the lines out there and the balls will go in.  Yeah, I'll just give it a go tomorrow and see how many we can get.
Q. What did you tell yourself at the start of play today, given that ThorbjÃ¸rn was so far ahead?
GEORGE COETZEE: You can't really look at it.  He's got his own thing to do and I've got my thing to do.  I was just trying to get back all the shots that I gave back yesterday and luckily I got them all.
Q. And there's so much to play for, isn't there; that's stating the obvious.
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I try to not even really think about it.  Just try and stay in the now.  Try and play golf today and try and shoot a good number today.
Q. It how easy is it to do that, particularly when you've had a quiet spell?
GEORGE COETZEE: No, not that easy.  But having played as bad as I have, it's always exciting to wake up when you feel like you're playing pretty good.
Q. Your feelings into the final day?
GEORGE COETZEE: Let's just say it's course record if you want to catch him.
