  Q. Looks like you picked up where you left off last week?  
 GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I'm trying to kind of build up to the British Open. I'll definitely take my score today and hopefully build on it over the weekend and tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You got to 7-under par but everyone knows who plays this course, staying on that score with the final four holes is never going to be easy.   
 GEORGE COETZEE: When I got to 7-under, I said well, nothing has changed, I still is have to go out and make pars because there's some really tough holes coming up. And then I made two bogeys, I guess the one -- both of them were actually kind of playing not conservative enough but I guess I'll learn and come back tomorrow.   
  
  Q. You were very close last week, you must feel that now you belong here on The European Tour.   
 GEORGE COETZEE: I think last week's third place kind of took a lot of pressure off me playing, finally securing my card and everybody comes out of Q-School, that's their first goal and kind of focusing on that goal kind of took away a couple of events from me and made me make a couple more mistakes.  
 But now I think that that's out of the way, I can start focusing on other goals and try and win some tournaments.
