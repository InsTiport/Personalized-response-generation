Q. Would you talk us through the round today?  It was a good one out there, wasn't it.
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, it was a little scrambly, a couple of loose shots out there.  But I felt like I capitalised on the holes that I hit good shots on.  Nice to make two eagles in a round.  All in all I'm quite happy with the score but a couple of things to sort out on the range this afternoon.
Q. Was it similar to last week's effort where one or two things just let you down and prevented you from an even better round?
GEORGE COETZEE: Last week I played really well.  I hit every shot the way I wanted to.  Obviously one back hole doesn't really affect your game enough to throw the baby out with the bath water, but today, it was a little loose, but quite happy with the score.
Q. Overall what were the conditions like out there?  Did you think that sort of number was there for the taking or even lower possibly?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, it's a little windy.  I think this makes Augusta looks like a playground with the way the wind swirls around.  Yeah, it's quite tough out there.  You have to hit really good tee shots.  You've got to judge the wind really well.  You've got to get lucky a little bit like I did.
Hit a 4-iron in on 10 and we thought it was just straight across, maybe a little bit into, and it was almost very strong down off the left and it hit the grandstands and bounced backed to is a foot.  You need to get a little bit lucky.  Hopefully tomorrow I can use my chances to hit a couple more better shots.
Q. All facets of your play, fairly happy with things or anything in particular was bugging you today?
GEORGE COETZEE: No, there's nothing to make a scene about.  Just swing it a little better, chip a little better, putt a little better and hopefully score a little better.
