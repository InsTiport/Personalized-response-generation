Q.   Looked like you might have been out there at 18, but things turned around quickly?
GEORGE COETZEE:   It's funny how this game works.   I didn't even think we should get to 18, and then when we got there I was it was quite a lot of trouble.   I feel like I played pretty well.

Q.   You got up early in the match.   What was going right for you?
GEORGE COETZEE:   Nothing really.   It was kind of just a game giving each other holes.   Whoever gave the most holes would lose the game.   I don't know, he came back quite nicely on the back nine.   He started playing well and then I started playing rubbish.   It was a bit of a topsy turvy.

Q.   Certainly going to make for an interesting Friday with everybody 1 & 1?
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, it should be good.

Q.   Talk about your approach on the first extra hole?
GEORGE COETZEE:   What's there to say? 

Q.   Club and distance for a start?
GEORGE COETZEE:   It was kind of a tricky club, because the 2‑iron is not really going to hole the green.   I can get a 4‑iron there.   And the 2‑iron just goes too low.   I would rather be a little long through the green if it lands perfectly.   Land it right into the bank, as the caddie said it should.
