  GEORGE COETZEE:   I'm just happy to shoot under par.   It's early in the year and it's taken me a while to get over the rust and usually it takes a couple of events in South Africa to get used to the game before this stretch which is quite a big stretch.   I'm happy to get things going in the right direction.   
The wind died down but it did blow a little today, and it's probably going to blow a little more this afternoon which will make it a little more tougher.   The rough is up and I'm quite happy considering it's still early in the year.   
I'm just happy to be here and be playing out on the Tour again, having had a long holiday and not played much golf, it's nice to catch some form again.  
   
 Q.   Are you the sort that makes New Year's resolutions and looking forward to 2013?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   No, no New Year's resolutions at all.   Obviously just want to improve my game and that's not really a New Year's resolution.   It's just lifestyle I guess.  
I'm quite happy with the way things went the last two years and I'll take it, if I can play like that the rest of my life, I'll be quite happy.   Just keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully I'll go through the door instead of keep knocking on it.
