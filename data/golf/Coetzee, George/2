 Q.  A relatively quiet front nine, level par and then birdies at 10, 11, 12. What were you thinking during that little run?  
GEORGE COETZEE: I was hoping it would continue but came to an abrupt halt on 13. Kind of the way I've been playing this week. It's either hot off the blocks, or kind of just hold on until you find something, and when you find something, just try and keep it.   
 Q.  13, the double bogey, how important is experience at that point, because the finish is so daunting and so much can happen, you need to stay calm?  
GEORGE COETZEE: You'd think the putt on 12 was the best putt I hit today, but the putt on 13 for bogey was probably the best putt I hit today. Because if I had not hit a good putt, I might have left myself a tester for about a double, probably make triple. I'm reasonably happy getting out of that hole with a double.   
 Q.  You've got the opportunity tomorrow to win this great championship but you have to chase down Nicolas Colsaerts, and it's to the going to be an easy task, is it, because he looks like he's playing very, very well?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, he hit the ball well. Missed the fairway by a yard maximum, two yards maximum. I guess I'll have to kind of play really good golf tomorrow.
