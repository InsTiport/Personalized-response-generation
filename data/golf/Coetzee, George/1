Q. 71, well-played today, what a final day. Can you even summarise the emotions of a day like this?
GEORGE COETZEE: Up-and-down. I was quite happy with the way I played today. Just one bad hole. But really happy for Nico, he played really well and it means a lot to him.
Q. You say one bad hole. That was throughout the field with the conditions?
GEORGE COETZEE: That's why I don't feel that bad because that is one of those holes that you can make a number and I made my number. Yeah, you've just got to get over it and try and make birdies after that.
Q. How proud are you of the mental aspect of your game to remain calm and keep battling through a day like this?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, maybe tomorrow I'll say I'm feeling good about it. At the moment, not that great.
I feel like 17 holes were really good.
Q. The best finish in this event in five years. You have to be happy with the week's work?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I guess that's what me and the Japanese have in common, third place, three points. I'm quite happy. It's obviously not the result I wanted but I'll take it.
