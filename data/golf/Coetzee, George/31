 Q.   How is a 64 to start this championship?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   Quite lucky to get away with the shots I hit today, but another good putting display to put a nice number.   But a long way to go so we'll see.   
   
 Q.   You're never just lucky.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   No, there's a lot of luck involved in this game, especially the way I've played.   I think I had 21 putts with a 3â€‘putt, so that goes to show, I can hit the ball a little bit better.  
   
 Q.   Give us an element of what worked in your favour then?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   Just catching some good lies in the desert, I don't it even hit in the rough.   I just hit it sideways and wide of the rough and catch some good lies in the desert.   
   
 Q.   You didn't have to take Desert Swing literally; you can actually find the fairway?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, I am doing that.   But I'm busy working on stuff on my swing, so it's nice to shoot good numbers when you're busy working on stuff.   But I can't wait for it to click because might be unstoppable.  
   
 Q.   Seems like it is clicking because that was a very prominent finish in Abu Dhabi last week?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, it was 21 putts again the last day, which kind of made the day, so looking forward to the coming months and this week as well.  
   
 Q.   A track you've had success here before?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, it kind of suits my eye, and a couple of holes that don't suit my eye have space on the side that I can miss on, but yeah, I really enjoy this place.  
   
 Q.   Any track at home that's remotely similar?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   No, we don't have a desert there.   I guess there's space off the tees which makes it a little easier but just being able to hit the greens, that's probably the thing that defines the golf course.
