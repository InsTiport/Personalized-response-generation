Q. Well-played today. How satisfied are you with that opening 65?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, it was almost perfect. Played really well. Just dropped one on 17, but yeah, I can't complain. It's nice to be in the mix again. It's been kind of a hard, long year, but feels like the game is coming along nice lie.
Q. And there's an excellent front nine. What are the holes where you can attack and what's the key to scoring around this course?
GEORGE COETZEE: I think you find which holes you can attack when you get to the green. There's no real aggressive game plan on this golf course. Just keep the ball in play and give yourself opportunities, and there's obviously a couple of holes where you've got to be careful, but I wouldn't say the ones -- there are holes that you can be -- you can be aggressive.
Q. Just about the conditions, seemed to be changeable at the start and certainly in patches. Did that help?
GEORGE COETZEE: I wouldn't say it helped, but it was weird. It was weird playing in the dark. I felt if I was a cricketer, they would have called it off. The course is in amazing nick. Dark and light doesn't really make a difference when the course is as good as it is. It's just really fun to play.
Q. Moving on to tomorrow, what's the game plan, more of the same?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, overall, find it, hit it again, put it hopefully.
