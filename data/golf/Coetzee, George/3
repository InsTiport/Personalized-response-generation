 Q.  A 68, how happy are you to be tied for the lead going into the weekend?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Very happy. The plan was to get a nice, late tee time so I can watch the rugby tomorrow morning. It was a tricky day. I think I got the good side of the draw there because the wind died down on the back nine, and you can see it started getting a little easier and made a couple more birdies.   
 Q.  Maybe not the first nine holes you wanted, but with the birdies, how pleased were you with to bounce back?  
GEORGE COETZEE: I wasn't too upset with the front nine. I made one bad decision and played the other holes pretty well. I was very happy with the start I got on the front nine. Yeah, it's always nice to kind of build momentum going into the weekend.   
 Q.  What part of your game do you think clicked today?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yesterday clicked. Today I clicked and clicked -- it's just up and down. I'm quite happy with everything.   
 Q.  On the weekend, will you be looking at the leaderboard or will you play your own game?  
GEORGE COETZEE: I'll look and I'll play my own game. I'll try and do a little bit of everything. Just try and have fun and enjoy the game. We know how angry up and set you can get about this game, but the plan is to stay out of the way.
