Q. How pleased are you with that?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I was pleased.  I love coming here.  I love playing the golf course.  It's one of the best courses we play all year.
Q. Take the U.S. Open out of the equation, your game has been in pretty good shape in the European Tour events that you've played so far this year?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, this year, it's been strange.  I've played really well.  I've really enjoyed my golf and I've put myself in contention quite a lot.  Just building on that and trying to be more consistent.
Q. What do you think the biggest test is on this track?  Obviously the last four holes are talked about as being very, very difficult.
GEORGE COETZEE: It's a lot to do with getting it in play off the tee.  There's a lot of punishment out there if you don't, and you can't really attack any of the flags.
I think the thing with the last four holes is that you have to do that and hit pretty good approach shots to the pin.  Yeah, you've got to do that for the next four days.
Q. And in terms of the Rolex Series, how nice would it be for you to have a good performance in one of these events?
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I missed the cut at Wentworth, so that wasn't ideal.  I'm looking forward to these couple of events coming up and hopefully I can post a couple of good rounds.
