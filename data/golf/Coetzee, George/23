Q.   To say this time last week you didn't think you were playing here are just sum up the week's experience for us? 
GEORGE COETZEE:   It was great.   I wasn't expecting that I would be here, first reserve on Sunday, but came here and some nice form and played some good golf and picked up a nice cheque. 

Q.   You must be mighty pleased that you pushed the players really hard this week. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Mighty tired.   I came here to compete.   I'm happy with the way I played and maybe a couple results go the other way, and all in all it's a good week.

Q.   Conditions looked tougher than the last four days. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, didn't see a 10â€‘under today.   We battled this afternoon.   The wind was picking up quite a lot and gusted quite strongly.   The course was in great nick. 

Q.   Looks like you're taking good form into the end of season. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, it's a good time to start playing well.   That was kind of always the plan.   I was hoping to pick up good form just before the end of season.   I didn't know I was going to, so it's nice to play some good golf. 

Q.   And just sum up the overall experience about this week. 
GEORGE COETZEE:   It's great.   Just to get to play the two rounds on Sunday, that was the main goal.   Obviously didn't want to lose but just to get here on Sunday, that's all you really want.
