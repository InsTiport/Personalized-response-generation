 Q.   We'll start at the end, that was a lovely way to finish, wasn't it?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   I've been itching to go at some of the par 5s today and most of them are pretty much unreachable, so it was nice to catch a decent lie in the rough there.   While we were walking down, I told my caddie, well, I don't think that could have worked out any better and lucky enough the putt went in.  
   
 Q.   How long was it?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   At least 30.   
   
 Q.   It tops a terrific day, because there's so many red figures.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   It's nice to be back in the swing of things and playing amongst the leaders and hopefully tomorrow will be just as good a day.   
   
 Q.   Well, after the first couple of days when you were‑‑ you've played well, but under the radar.   What made the difference?  
GEORGE COETZEE:   Well, yesterday, the first two days, I actually played pretty badly.   My bunker play was pretty awesome.   The first two days I think I was in eight or nine bunkers and up‑and‑downed every one and holed one.   
So that kind of got me to the weekend, so I was just happy to be here.   But I guess today it just clicked a little better and the putts dropped.   
   
 Q.   This is on the back of some decent form at home.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, well, I've been playing well the first couple of weeks back in South Africa, maybe just not finished as well as I would have wanted to, but always a new week, new chance.  
   
 Q.   Excited to be in a field of this stature, I take it.   
GEORGE COETZEE:   First time playing against Tiger, so that's pretty cool.   Just been seeing him prowling the fairways, so I'm enjoying it.   
   
 Q.   So you are looking out for him and still presumably a bit awestruck?   
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, he's Tiger Woods.   What more can you say.
