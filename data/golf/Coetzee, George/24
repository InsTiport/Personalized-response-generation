Q.   One bogey so far in four matches, what is it you're doing particularly well? 
GEORGE COETZEE:   Trying to stay out of trouble.   I'm hitting the ball pretty good this week.   Maybe putt a little better.   But I feel like I'm playing well, just trying not to make any mistakes.   That's the name of the game in the Match Play, not to give any holes away. 

Q.   You came into this week as the lowest‑ranked player in the field, and not expected to win any matches.   Do you enjoy that underdog ranking, just go and think that?
GEORGE COETZEE:   Yeah, it's nice that everybody thinks that.   I've actually been playing nicely the last couple of weeks.   My ranking took a knock this year, but it's starting to come together nicely.

Q.   As an amateur you said match play was your favourite format of the game.   What is it you particularly like about head‑to‑head? 
GEORGE COETZEE:   It's about waiting for mistakes to happen‑‑ just playing man on man.   It's the closest you get to contact sports in golf.

Q.   You said you felt you had nothing to lose.   Now you have a real chance to win this iconic championship; same attitude? 
GEORGE COETZEE:   No, I'm happy‑‑ hopefully I'll take the trophy home.
