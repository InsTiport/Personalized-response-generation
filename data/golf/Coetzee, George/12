 Q.  Your thoughts on the opening round?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, quite happy.  We knew the winds was going to pick up during the round and quite happy to be under par early on and kept it going.   
 Q.  You made plenty of birdies out there.  What was the key?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Just some good shots.  Kind of waited for my birdies and didn't try to force them.  Kind of played my game and luckily they came.   
 Q.  Give me an idea of how the course is playing out there?  
GEORGE COETZEE: It's pretty good.  I think with this wind, it will play a bit trickier and surfaces are pretty good on the golf course, so no reason not to make birdies.   
 Q.  How are you feeling about your game?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I haven't had the best start to the year, so it's obviously nice to get a nice round in early on.   
 Q.  It's nice to get a good round in, and plenty to go, you must be pleased with the way you're swinging it out there?  
GEORGE COETZEE: Yeah, I'm hitting good shots.  Trying to hit some shots and they are able to come out the way I wanted them.  Yeah, hopefully hit it the same the rest of the week.
