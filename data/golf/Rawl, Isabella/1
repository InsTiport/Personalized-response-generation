Q. Want to tell me a little bit about the match.
ISABELLA RAWL: Well, they were 2-up through what?
KARLEE VARDAS: Through 15?
ISABELLA RAWL: 15.  Karlee made a clutch putt on 16; I made a clutch putt on 17, and 18 and then on the last hole.
KARLEE VARDAS: (Indiscernible) she drained the birdie.
ISABELLA RAWL: Yeah, it was fun.  We didn't want to go to school tomorrow.

KARLEE VARDAS: No.
Q. What was it like playing your competitors over here?  They've got quite a bit of experience.
KARLEE VARDAS: Yeah, definitely made it a challenge.
ISABELLA RAWL: We kind of got -- we were 2-up through what, like nine?
KARLEE VARDAS: Through the turn.
ISABELLA RAWL: We didn't play good on the back nine.  We just kind of lost it.
KARLEE VARDAS: And then we were 2-down and we just realized, we woke up and were like, We need to get it together.
ISABELLA RAWL: You could tell that were experienced.  They knew how to handle the pressure.
KARLEE VARDAS: They were really good.
ISABELLA RAWL: They never played bad golf.
KARLEE VARDAS: Uh-uh.  Never had a stall.
ISABELLA RAWL: They were solid pretty much.
KARLEE VARDAS: Very solid.
Q. So when you guys saw that you were going down a bumpy road there, did you have a conversation or just looked at each other and knew it was time to switch it up?
KARLEE VARDAS: You told me to like stay calm.
ISABELLA RAWL: Yeah.  My thoughts were like staying calm.  I live for these moments.  Like I love them.  It's just what -- I've never really had that type of -- not as big, but I think it's just cool like coming up 18 knowing you have to birdie it and then playing those, what, four holes?
KARLEE VARDAS: The adrenaline is up.
ISABELLA RAWL: Yeah, your adrenaline.  I just love it.
Q. So how did today differ from playing yesterday?
ISABELLA RAWL: Oh, it's way different because you're playing against somebody.
KARLEE VARDAS: Way different, yeah.
ISABELLA RAWL: Yesterday and the day before we could just go out there and go as low as we could.
KARLEE VARDAS: Make pars, make birdies, but today we had to like really win the hole.
ISABELLA RAWL: Yeah, you're competing against people and it's just way different.  I love it.
KARLEE VARDAS: Because we had to save birdies.  If they birdied we had to save birdie, so it wasn't like we can go under.  It was just save the hole, you know?
Q. Absolutely.  So what's the game plan now?  What are you going to do to prep for tomorrow?
ISABELLA RAWL: I need some sleep.
KARLEE VARDAS: Yeah, definitely tired.
Q. Yeah.
KARLEE VARDAS: Practice a little bit.
ISABELLA RAWL: Yeah, go out to dinner.  See what our tee times are.
Q. Thank you so much guys.  See you tomorrow in the Sweet 16.  Have a good night.
