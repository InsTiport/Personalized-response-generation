 Q. Christian, another very good day, no mistakes, now when you started off and you know you have to make a lot of birdies, do you think you're going to play a risk/reward game or do you try to make no mistakes, which way do you go about it? 
 CHRISTIAN NILSSON: I don't really know. I'm trying to stick to my strategy. This course let's you get a lot of wedges into the greens, so you can create birdie chances if you just hit the fairways and. And the par 5s is also four good chances. I think you need to stay patient and hope for a few putts to drop.

 Q. Is there any part of the golf course where you do actually play safe? 
 CHRISTIAN NILSSON: I don't really know. I hit a few 4-woods out there, but mostly drivers and had to lay up on a few par 5s today. If I hit the fairways on the par 5s I usually go for the green.

 Q. And what's your Sunday form like generally?
 CHRISTIAN NILSSON: I don't know, I've been having two great days in a row now, so hopefully I can make another one, but you never know. It's a big week for me. I'm trying to get into the Top 60, so I hope for another good day but you never know.
