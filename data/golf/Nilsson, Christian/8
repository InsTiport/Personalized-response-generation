Q.  Tell us how good that round was.
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  Yeah, I'm very pleased.  I've got to hold it together for this week.  I'm very pleased with 11 under this far.
Q.  You say you've got the game together, so it hasn't been together for recent weeks?
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  No, I haven't played that well the last couple weeks.  I missed a few shots, the putting has not been that good, a few tournaments the drives have been too wide.  This week so far has been great altogether.
Q.  So what has really made the difference?
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  I don't know, I've found good rhythm and tempo in my body, and I think that's the reason so far.
Q.  Something that you've found yourself or by working with somebody?
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  By working with my coach, Henry Rice, and by myself, as well.  The tempo and the rhythm is within me, so I have to find it myself.  I got a bit of help from him, as well.
Q.  I have to say it's a little while since we last saw you.  You had the win in Portugal.
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  Yeah, I did.  But I haven't been playing that good after that week.  Hopefully I'm going to play two more rounds good, and then I'm pleased.
Q.  I know you talked about particular aspects of the game, but I suppose that's just the nature of golf, isn't it?  Sometimes things work, sometimes they don't?
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  Yeah, that's the way it is.  Let's keep trying and hopefully it's going to work tomorrow, as well.
Q.  I take it you like this place?
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  Yeah, I like it a lot.  Good course.  I like the course very much.
Q.  What is it that appeals?
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  I think the course suits me quite well because if you get the drives quite long, I think it's quite wide, as well, and the rough is not that tough, either.  You can bang a few drives (laughing) and hit them on the green.
Q.  Not too hot for you?
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  Sometimes it is, but you have to keep a towel and dry the sweat off you.
Q.  I did ask Garry Houston what he reckoned the score would be.  He's saying it's got to be 20 under, Ian Woosnam is saying maybe 22 under?
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  Yeah, that might be right.  The greens are soft and the rough is not that tough, so I think it's going to be low scores.
Q.  Enjoy banging it out there.
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:  Thank you.
