   CHRISTIAN NILSSON: I had a good start with two birdies on 3 and 4. I was up there, all day. I couldn't really finish it off. So a bit disappointing. But happy with my game again. Didn't putt that well today. Not good enough. So a bit disappointing but still happy with my game.

 Q. Presumably you were aware of what Tom Lewis had done some time ago and you knew what you had to chase. 
 CHRISTIAN NILSSON: When I came up on 13, I see him on 20-under and so I needed that -- I thought that I was going to be 21 or something to have a chance. But even still, second place was something I was focusing on the last holes, get to go 19 or 20-under. So I didn't do it unfortunately.

 Q. But plenty of positives nonetheless I guess?
 CHRISTIAN NILSSON: Two great rounds, and even the first day and today was good from tee-to-green. Feels good, anyway.

 Q. What do you think of this man that has won? 
 CHRISTIAN NILSSON: I never played with him. The first time I heard about him was at the British Open of course, like everyone else. Very impressive. He's going to be a big star on this tour probably, like the other young guys. 

 Q. And having faced that back nine yourself, to see what he achieved with five birdies in six holes, that's quite something, isn't it. 
 CHRISTIAN NILSSON: That's very impressive. The wind was quite tough today so five birdies on the home stretch is impressive.

 Q. Castellon next week?
 CHRISTIAN NILSSON: Castellon next week and Valderrama the week after that. So hopefully one or two more good finishes. Castellon, it's a favourite place of mine, so hopefully I can do something good again.
