 Q.   If you wouldn't mind, how have you played over these two days?   
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:   It's been all right actually.   Long game is working okay, so hitting a lot of greens and hitting most of the fairways, so it's pretty solid.   
   
 Q.   I take it not dissatisfied with the round of 70 in some tricky windy conditions.   
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:   Yeah, I'll take it.   It's quite difficult.   I think the pins today were quite hard as well today compared to yesterday.   I think it played maybe one or two shots more difficult today.   
So actually around 70, yeah, I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   Elaborate on the differences, I know it wasn't flat calm on your round the first day, but this is totally different in the sense with the way the wind changes direction?  
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:   Yeah, it is, and I think we had a good draw, we played almost nine holes yesterday in calm conditions.   So the back nine yesterday was quite similar to today's round.   So it's quite tricky.   It's quite hard wind, so it's tricky out there.   
   
 Q.   Nice to see your name up on the board?   
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:   I've been struggling big time, so this is a huge week for me.   So I need to please keep playing good.   
   
 Q.   Why the struggle?   How come the transition?   
CHRISTIAN NILSSON:   I don't really know.   I have been practising really hard and maybe confidence is the main thing‑‑ it's quite hard to keep the confidence up.   I've been practising hard and I kept believing in myself and trying to play golf.   
It's good at the moment and nice to make a cut again and play two more rounds.
