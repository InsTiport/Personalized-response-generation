Q. You seemed to be cruising at 12 under. Did the chill factor kick in?
BRADLEY DREDGE:  I think the wet factor set in. It was pretty nasty. Both me and Stephen hit drives off ten that literally went sideways. It was pretty windy but with these drivers nowadays when the face gets a bit wet the ball squirts off a bit. I had some awful drives on the back nine.
Q.  You seemed absolutely in control at the start?
BRADLEY DREDGE:  Yeah, I was playing good. I felt like I was swinging well and playing quite aggressively. But it wasn't the back nine I wanted

Q.  Is that what you take into tomorrow - how well you started today?
BRADLEY DREDGE:  Yeah, it's frustrating. I tried to birdie the last to give myself a chance for tomorrow but made bogey. I have a chance but it's very much an outside one now.
