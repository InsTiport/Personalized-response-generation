Q. You opened this time last year with a 69 and this time a 67 but must have felt like a 65?
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, for sure, it was getting tougher and tougher out there.  Obviously delighted with that score to start the tournament off.
Q. Obviously a few subtle changes for later in the year, a few bunkers and pinching in the fairways?
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, it's fantastic.  In my opinion I think it's playing just right at the moment in terms of firmness.  There's just a bit of give on the fairways and the greens.  So if you are in the fairways or getting close to the pins -- which is what you've got to do.
Got to have to a bad start on 10 with a poor tee shot and made bogey, but after that to remain bogey-free, very pleased with that.  Great save on 7.  That was a bit of a bonus to make par from a poor tee shot.  Other than that, just solid golf and kept the ball in play and putted well.  It's always going to be a good day then.
