Q. 1-over today.  How would you assess how it went for you?
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, saw the forecast today, so I knew it was going to be a bit more wind.  So makes this course much more difficult than it normally is.  That I thought level par was a good score out there today.  Saw some guys still shooting some numbers, but 1-over wasn't my best day but still keeps me up there.
Q. Conditions a lot different to yesterday.  How much does that affect your mind-set going out?
BRADLEY DREDGE: It sort of swirls a bit amongst the trees.  It's a tough course, anyway, so you're trying to cope with those added sort of -- the wind as an added factor and it just makes it more tricky.
Q. On the back nine, a few chances went astray but a good up-and-down to save par at 16?
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, thought it was a good approach shot but was about 15, 20 yards from the pin.  Disappointed to see it plugged in the bunker but a really good putt, a 20-footer, par save, so I was obviously delighted with that.
Q. A bit disappointed overall but you're still in there after 36 holes with a chance to win this tournament, which must please you?
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, exactly.  I struggled a bit off the tee today.  I said yesterday, drove the ball well.
So yeah, still up there.  I don't think I'll be too far away at the end of the day, so gives me a chance at the weekend.
