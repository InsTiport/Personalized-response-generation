BRADLEY DREDGE: Obviously played well today.  Nice to get it going early on, and then just cooled things off a bit in the middle.  Had to restart back and bogeyed 11, which was a bit disappointing.  Got it together and then made some good birdies, 13, 17 and 18.
Q. What's been the key to getting around here this week?
BRADLEY DREDGE: Trying to stay dry.  For me, I think driving the ball.  You get the ball in play and drive it well, it just gives you opportunities heading into the greens.
I think the first two rounds for me, it was scrambling.  I scrambled really well.  Still managed to post two decent rounds, so that kept me in with a chance in the weekend.
I think it's going to be just shy.  Obviously I needed the putt on the last from a distance, and thought chance would have a chance for a playoff but you've got to think 10, 11 is going to be the number.
Q. Did you peek at the board?  Did you have a number in mind?
BRADLEY DREDGE: I was looking to get to 10, half a chance.  Had a chance on the last.  It was long distance.  Gave it a chance, good putt.  Just missed.
Q. How were the conditions?
BRADLEY DREDGE: It's tricky sort of having to restart all the time.  Tricky having to restart, losing rhythm.  I was playing nicely and came back out to 11 and just played the hole poorly.  That was a bit frustrating, but it's the same for everybody.
