Q.  Great round after the start you made?
BRADLEY DREDGE:  Doubled the first, just lost a ball left and no idea where is went so that wasn;t very nice. Then pulled it back. Just kept making putts. Hardly missed anything. Missed from five feet on the seventh and three putted but that was about it. Apart from that played nicely. Hit drive and  four wood to three feet for the eagle. It was close to going in as it was past the hole. That was one of my shorter attempts today. Just had one of those days on the greens where you see the line and it goes in. It's nice to get out there and play.

The game is a little up and down. Keep doing something silly but it is getting there. But nice the have the putting back on form.
Q. What did you do last week?
BRADLEY DREDGE:  I was in Spain. Took four or five days off and then did a little practice. Look forward to coming out here.
