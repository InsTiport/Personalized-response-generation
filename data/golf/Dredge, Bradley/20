   BRADLEY DREDGE: Played steady today. Gave myself a lot of chances, especially I will around the turn from the 14th or 15th, I could have made a bundle more, but you're not going to make everything. At the end of the day, bogey-free golf, very pleased.

 Q. And that is better than steady, really. You're being modest. 
 BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, I actually played quite well yesterday, a couple bad iron shots which caused me to drop a few shots yesterday. 
 Today the weather has been unusual, teeing off pretty early this morning, it was quite windy and then we had some rain and then the wind sort of died down. And it's sort of died down now, which is a bit annoying because we played in some windy conditions yesterday.

 Q. I thought you were going to get the wrong end of the draw entirely, because it blew, not a gale, I exaggerate; there were some strong winds yesterday. It was cold for you. Everybody else had played in flat calm and might twist like that again. 
 BRADLEY DREDGE: That's the way it goes sometimes but you can only do what you can do. You can't control the weather conditions. But you know, hopefully it will blow this afternoon. 

 Q. Good position, come what may?
 BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, exactly. I think at the moment with the lack of wind, the greens are still relatively soft, so there are some good scores to be had out there, so I would not be surprised if the leading score goes lower than 10 at the moment.

 Q. What do you think of the place, the course in particular?
 BRADLEY DREDGE: It's a bit of a challenge in places, with the greens, obviously, but same for everybody and we've just got to get on with it and try and cope with it as best you can.
