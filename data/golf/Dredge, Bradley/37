   BRADLEY DREDGE:  I didn't play very well but in the conditions I've got to be pleased with a 73. It was pleasant at the start of the day and I got the best of the conditions. They were perfect and it was relatively cool. It was an opportunity to shoot a good score but unfortunately I didn't play well enough.   
 I could have used someone else's golf swing - anyone really! It's difficult to control the ball out of the rough. You don't know what's going to happen. I've got a 12.45 tee time tomorrow and that's going to be tough. At least I got in 2 hours in relative cool today. A 73 isn't very good really. If you keep the ball on the fairways there are enough short irons to the greens to create birdie chance. The heat is very influential, though.
