 Q.  Bradley, a good start yesterday.  It's been a little bit more up-and-down today with this wind that it is.  Just sum up how Friday has gone for you.  
BRADLEY DREDGE: A bit mixed.  It was a bit of a first at the start.  And double four.  Hit it into a lie just struggled to get it out from there, which happens around here.  But overall just struggled off the tee, hit five fairways and did well shoot one over, so at the end of the day that was a good score.   
 Q.  I was going to say, when you look at some of the other scores, you must feel you got away relatively unscathed.  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah.  I mean, the wind sort of died down for a little while, so I think we had a good side of the draw.  So it made things a bit easier for a lot of it.  It's not an easy course, and like I said, I just couldn't put the ball in play today.  So need to work on that for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Just how tough are those closing holes here compared to what you play week in, week out?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, I mean end up in the weeds, being in on 15, 16, 18, and then 17 is downwind.  So yeah, it's probably certainly the toughest that we play as a stretch that we play probably on tour.  Certainly gets your attention when you're standing in the middle of a fairway with a 4-iron and know that it's not much of a miss.   
 Q.  But if you start looking at the two days, it must be nice now going into the weekend seeing you're right up on the leaderboard?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah.  Point out the negatives to my game, but my approach play is really good, and I'm putting really well.  So I just need to get a little bit better off the tee, and you never know.   
 Q.  Have a great weekend.
