Q. Three birdies in a row.  Off to a nice start?
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, off to a bit of run there, holed a few good putts in a row.  A bit of a struggle at the end of the day today, so 2-under was a good score.
Q. Yesterday was a case of having to stay patient.  It really came into play around the turn for you.  Was today more of the same, having to be patient out there?
BRADLEY DREDGE: I started on the back nine yesterday, so I got off to a bit of fly yesterday, birdied the first three.  The rest of the day I was playing really well.  I got two on my back nine, the front nine.  Putter went a bit cold yesterday.  Could have been quite low.
Today, I was just hanging from there, not feeling great, struggling with the game today.  Holed some really good putts coming in to get the score as it was.
Q. You've had some fairly good results of late, so you must feel that you are playing as well as you can this season?
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, playing nicely.  Hopefully a bit of form for the weekend and see what we can do.
