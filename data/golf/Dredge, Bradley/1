 Q.  Talk about the hole-in-one on 17?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: It's been quite a few years coming.  I've had ten holes in one, but never in tournament play.  Nice to do it here.  I got a very nice car by BMW, so pleased with that.   
 Q.  You were lucky to get that prize because we already had two hole-in-ones yesterday?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: That was on a easy hole, 15.  That was a proper hole.   
 Q.  Tell us about this proper hole.  How did you approach it?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Actually, today, at least the pin position was in there in quite a friendly position.  The wind is off the right slightly in.  It was a comfortable 5-iron.  Managed to hit a good shot.  I couldn't actually see it going in but I could tell from the crowd's reaction that it's gone in.  Delighted.   
 Q.  How crazy is it after all these years of playing golf, that today is the day that it happens?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Unfortunately it just goes to show perhaps my iron play is.  Yeah, nice to get one.  It's great, and nice to win a nice car at the end of it.  Fantastic.
