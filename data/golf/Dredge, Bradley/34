  Q.  Ernie Els last year in the first round, Sabbatini this year.  What's the secret?   
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  I don't really know.  I wish I knew what it was because I keep doing that.  I played solid again today, and I holed a good putt to finish the match up.  I just did the right things.   
  
  Q.  Is head-to-head match play something you enjoy?   
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Yeah I mean, as an amateur I played an awful lot of it, and as a professional you don't get to do it very often unless you play Ryder Cup or Seve Trophy for us.  So it's always nice to come play this event.  It was a great win, and it's always great to play some match play golf.   
  
  Q.  Do you think this Match Play Championship gives you the best chance to win a World Championship event?   
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  It's a good time, actually.  I suppose at the end of the day, it's six good rounds.  You could get lucky -- if you are off on one of the days and your opponent is a bit off, then you could just get through.   
  
  Q.  You're going to be playing Casey tomorrow, whom you know well.  Are you looking forward to that?   
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Yeah, it should be good.  Yeah, we're good mates with one another, so we'll have a good day tomorrow.
