 Q.  Start of the week here in Morocco, can't ask for much better than that?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, a good day obviously.  Very pleased to be leading the tournament after round one.  Played nicely all day.  So delighted.   
 Q.  What pleased you most about your game out there today?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Driving I think.  I've been lacking a bit of consistency and today I really drove it in play every hole and a lot of fairways.  From there, gave myself a lot of chances.   
 Q.  Great conditions out there to play golf.  Obviously that must help when you go around?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, I mean, it's perfect.  The temperature's perfect.  There's very little wind and the course is in immaculate condition.  It's a matter of getting the ball in play and trying to be careful into the greens and understanding where the pin is and understanding where you can putt from and not putt from.   
 Q.  Where would you assess your game is at the moment?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: Yeah, I haven't played a great deal this year.  I feel as though it's progressing quite well at the moment, so I'm quite pleased the way it's trending, as a lot of guys say.   
 Q.  Obviously tomorrow is a brand new day.  Any specific game plan in mind?  
BRADLEY DREDGE: No, I mean, around this place, it's a very strong course tee-to-green, and like I said, the greens are difficult now.  So it's just a matter of keeping the ball in play and shot-to-shot, as in looking where the pin positions are and then taking into consideration whether or not you can go for the pin or play away from it.
