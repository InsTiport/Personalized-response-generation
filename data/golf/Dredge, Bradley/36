   BRADLEY DREDGE: It was a tough day today. We both played 36 holes but nice to get a full point this afternoon after we lost the last two holes in the morning for a half. When Miguel holed a long one on the 16th this afternoon we were started to sweat a little bit, to be honest. That point helps greatly. Only one point gap now and I feel we will be up and ready to go for it. I think Nick couldn't find anyone to go with the Welshman so they put Phil with me.
