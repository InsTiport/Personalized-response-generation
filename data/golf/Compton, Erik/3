Q.   Erik, a round that started extremely quickly, 4‑under after five yesterday, finished with 68.   How do you feel about that one?
    ERIK COMPTON:   Yeah, it was kind of sour, you know.   Putter went cold.   
    I had four lip‑outs in a row, so that kind of stunning a little bit, but you know, if I shoot 10 or 11 under par on this last round, maybe I have a chance.   Jason is playing so well, and you know, it's just‑‑ the conditions, you can birdie every hole out there.

Q.   What's the biggest challenge that someone with your medical history faces playing 30 holes in a day, which is what you're going to be doing?
    ERIK COMPTON:   None.

Q.   Really? 
    ERIK COMPTON:   None. 

Q.   No issues with stamina or anything?
    ERIK COMPTON:   I'm good to go. 

Q.   Good man.   Well played.
