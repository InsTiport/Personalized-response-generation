Q. Great round, 6-under in these conditions.  What does it feel like to get off to a great start, especially playing in an afternoon where it was tougher?ERIK COMPTON: Yeah, I mean, the scores were very low today.  I just talked to a few guys.  I had lunch and they said they shot 4- or 5-under.  I thought, wow, I didn't want to talk to anybody else because I thought the scores were so low.  But when we got to the tee, it was a bit windy and the round kind of developed, obviously having the hole in one on 7.  I hit a nice pitching wedge in there, and made some great putts in the back.  Yeah, just got to keep plugging every day.Q. Real quick, can we talk about that hole in one?  I understand it's your first of your career.  Excitement or what was the yardage?ERIK COMPTON: Yeah, obviously a very exciting day.  I always wondered if I'd ever get one because I'm 35, and I've been playing professional golf for 15 years and never had a hole in one in competition.  So, yeah, my friend Carlos was on the bag today, so I told him we'll probably remember that forever.  I just had 135 yards and hit it about 130 and it bounced once and went in the hole.Q. Lastly, what's it mean to you to have this good round and be able to get out in the morning when the conditions are more favorable?ERIK COMPTON: Well, you've got to wake up and hopefully you bring your game.  Good rounds can come at any time, so you just have to make sure that you get a good night's rest.  And it's a long tournament, so this is just one round under my belt.
