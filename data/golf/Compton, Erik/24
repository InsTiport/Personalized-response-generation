 Q. We're here with Erik Compton, who is tied for second place with 4‑under.   Just finished his first rounds after a long rain delay.   How do you feel after that putt?  
ERIK COMPTON:   It was kind of weird just hitting one putt, and now we have the rest of the day off, I think.   It was a good day yesterday.   Different course today, so I would imagine there will be a lot of low scores if it stays like this.  
Just got to keep putting your foot down and try to shoot as low as you can when you get a chance to play.  
   
 Q.   How was that night thinking about that one putt?   
ERIK COMPTON:   I mean, it was a 20‑footer straight up the hill.   It was pretty easy.   So it wasn't like I had‑‑ it wasn't a really legit birdie putt, but it wasn't a tough two‑putt.   
I had in my mind of I got lucky it would be 5‑under, and if not I would just two‑putt.   No, that's it.   
Just the golf course was playing really windy yesterday.   You had to hit a lot of low, low shots.   The conditions are going to change dramatically with all the different rain delays we have.  
Actually be nice to be playing golf right now.   It's calm.   It's still a good round, so you got to take a little piece of the pie every day.   
   
 Q.   Any plans for the rest of the day before you tee off again?  
ERIK COMPTON:   Probably just hang out, relax, maybe do a little light workout and maybe get a massage or something here.
