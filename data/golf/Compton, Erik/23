Q.   Today you looked very comfortable out there.   You got a bad lie on 18 in the bunker.   But all in all I thought today was a really good day for you. 
ERIK COMPTON:   Yeah, all week was a great week.
It's funny, I switched balls on the last hole.   I played 17 holes with one ball and then switched and made a bogey.
18 is such a tough hole.   I played aggressive to that pin.   I hit a good shot and just had the wrong club.

Q.   We talked a lot over the last few years about everything but golf.   And now I think we can start talking about your game, because it's running in shape, don't you think?
ERIK COMPTON:   Yeah, if I can get the ball in play, I feel like I have a good chance to finish in the top‑10 during the week.   And the driver has been a problem for me for most of my career.   But I just swung within myself and geared back a lot on my driving distance.   The putter is coming around.   The game is sharpening up a little.

Q.   Are you doing some scoreboard watching today?
ERIK COMPTON:   I didn't look at anything.   The only time I looked was‑‑ well, Arnold Palmer was on 16, and he gave me the thumbs up.   It's kind of hard to hit a shot when you're in contention and he's looking at you.
It was disappointing not to birdie that hole during the weekend on 16.   But the greens were getting really tight and the hole locations were so tucked today, they didn't give you a lot of options, which I like, because it kind of suits my game.   I don't really go at pins.   Guys are going to have a hard time coming down the stretch. 

Q.   Congratulations on a top‑10 finish.   We're going to see you win next week? 
ERIK COMPTON:   Yes, next two weeks.
