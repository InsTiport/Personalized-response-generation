 Q.   What did you have in on 18 there?   
    ERIK COMPTON:   240 hole.  
   
 Q.   What did you hit?  
    ERIK COMPTON:   A cut 2‑iron.   
   
 Q.   Talk about that finish.   Obviously, you gave a couple back early, and how does that enlighten you for this week?   
    ERIK COMPTON:   It's a great atmosphere out here.   Obviously, it's playing very difficult.   There are some shady spots that, if you hit it, you can make some bogeys.   And I didn't feel like I was playing that bad.   Bogeyed 11 and 12, and then had a rough stretch there and then kind of seemed to get it back.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts on chasing Tiger down the stretch here?   
    ERIK COMPTON:   I'm trying to chase myself down here.   So just trying to play one shot at a time, hit the ball on the fairway and feel good with the putter.   
   
 Q.   On 17 it looked like you knew that was going to drop.   Was that hoping or did you see it leaning?  
    ERIK COMPTON:   I don't know.   It was a great moment, obviously.   It was one of the coolest moments I've ever seen for me as a professional.   That was kind of neat.   So just got to hopefully get some rest and have a strong round.   
    Tiger's behind me, I'm trying to fight back, and it was on the lip.   Stayed there for a minute and ten just the crowd's reaction, my reaction, I don't even know what I did.   But it was great.  
   
 Q.   You were pointing to it before it went down.   It was like you knew it was going to.   
    ERIK COMPTON:   I don't know.   It was great.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
    ERIK COMPTON:   I think anybody would take birdie‑eagle, right?   
   
 Q.   How much fun is it to be in contention?   
    ERIK COMPTON:   It's the ultimate for me.   This is what I've been trying to do for years, so it's great.
