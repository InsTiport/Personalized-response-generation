  Q. Just comments on your day out there.   
 ERIK COMPTON: You know, I didn't get much preparation for the tournament. I kind of knew that. Unfortunately I just didn't have much focus today, and it was just kind of mixed emotions when you come off a win. I can't beat myself up too bad. I feel like I struck the ball okay, just the grind is out of me. It's hard to grind.  
  
  Q. What about fatigue factor?  
 ERIK COMPTON: No, I'm not so much tired, just mentally being on the road for five weeks, just -- you know, I always said when I won I would take a week off and celebrate. This is a great tournament on an awesome golf course, and tomorrow I can -- I almost feel like today was my practice round, so maybe tomorrow I'll come out and shoot 4- or 5-under.
