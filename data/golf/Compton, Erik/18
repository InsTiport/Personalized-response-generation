STEVE SANDS: Erik, you can see right there a couple of 67s on that board, Rickie Fowler, now Erik Compton.  Best round of the day on a very difficult golf course.  Erik, how would you express the difficulty for the people watching at home of what the challenge is in front of you here at Pinehurst No. 2 today.ERIK COMPTON: It's a very difficult golf course.  I thought the weather was a little bit cooler today.  Yesterday it was extremely hot and for me it can be difficult when it gets hot. But I felt really comfortable out there and I picked good targets and made aggressive swings.  I pulled off a lot of great shots on the front nine. I'm just really happy to be here.  When I was walking down 18, it's like you try to keep your self focused, but you're emotional and you're in the competition and, look, it's just really great to be here and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.STEVE SANDS: This is just your second ever Major Championship in your career.  The other came in 2010 at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.  You missed the cut that year.  Here you are on the first page of the leaderboard going to the final round.  How would you compare your comfort level that week to this week?ERIK COMPTON: You got to give me a break, I just had a new heart when I was at Pebble Beach.  But I think I've had an excellent year this year and I feel really comfortable out on the golf course.  My swing has come around, I'm putting really well, so, you know, we're playing against the same guys.  I think the conditions are extremely difficult, and when it gets really hard, I seem to really focus.  I'm very hard on myself, but I'm also easy to get over it.  So I think a U.S. Open style kind of fits my game and seems like the harder golf courses, I've had good finishes this year. It's a great tournament and hopefully I have a great day tomorrow and you never know what can happen.
