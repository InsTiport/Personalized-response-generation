XANDER SCHAUFFELE: All you can do in a major is try to get off to a good start, so that's what we did so pretty pleased with the day.
Q. Lucky finish on 18?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, lucky finish.  I hit a toe ball there.  The line I thought wasn't too aggressive.  If I hit it solid I do have 290 in the air.  But when you hit it off the toe and it's diving against a cut wind it usually doesn't work out.  Luckily I hit the correct shot of a rock and it sort of careened down the fairway, 168 out.  Very fortunate and happy we capitalized on a really lucky break.
Q. (No microphone.)
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I hit a good putt.  I wouldn't really take a whole lot of confidence from the drive or the 8-iron.  I pulled it.  I wasn't trying to line it within a foot of that pin.  I was trying to leave it below the hole about 15 feet and I hit it about nine feet past it.  I'm going to head to the range and try to clean up some of the iron play and maybe a couple of the drives.
Q. (No microphone.)
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Just the mentality changes, a little more focused coming into the week, extra preparation.  You just kind of dive a little bit deeper into the properties.  And I feel like the team and I have done a decent job of doing that.
Q. (No microphone.)
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Sorry, can you say that again?
Q. (No microphone.)
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it is, you prepare for wind and fog and all kinds of stuff.  And today the weather was really benign.  It was nice.  I'll take it.  But preparation definitely came in a different way.  And fortunately we were able to adjust with the game plan with a little bit less wind.
