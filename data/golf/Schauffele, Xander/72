 Q.  Valient effort.  Your thoughts, Xander.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Kind of refreshing to be in the hunt and play well, I guess.  You know, I shot 3-under today which was probably one of my better final rounds.   
 Q.  You were tied for 3rd, moves you into 18th.  You get a ticket to get all the way back the Atlanta to defend your title.  How sweet is that?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It's awesome.  Been a long week.  So, it will settle in on flight home.   
 Q.  Good luck in Atlanta.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Thank you very much.   
 Q.  As you look back on this week, what do you take away from it?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Success.  I had a chance to get in the playoff -- I didn't know, one more shot I would have been in the playoffs.  Played well and put myself in position is all I can ask.   
 Q.  What did you do well this week?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Mental mistakes, kept them to a minimum.  I was a little more focused than I was previously and it sort of paid off.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you have momentum now going to Atlanta?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Definitely feel like I need some rest like everyone else out here.  Looking forward to going to Atlanta.
