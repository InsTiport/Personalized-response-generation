XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Good vibes, I guess, really relaxing playing with Leish, and I guess you could say we fed off each other on the back nine birdieing all the same holes.   
 Q.  Wind's supposed to be a different direction tomorrow, down a little bit as well.  Do you feel like you're going to need to be a little more aggressive to possibly put a low number together to hold the trophy?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, Gary's probably going to have an eagle look or a good birdie look on 18, so it looks like we'll be five, six behind going into tomorrow, so it's going to take something special.   
 Q.  Do you feel your game is where it needs to be to possibly put that low number together and come out on top?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I feel like I'm playing well.  It's nice to be playing well this early in the year.  Usually I'm sort of a midyear kind of guy, so we're trying to learn how to peak at the right moments.
