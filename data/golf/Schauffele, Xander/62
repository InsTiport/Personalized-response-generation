Q. What a day.  First off, this win means so much.  Jump start on the FedExCup standings, a third of the way already to THE TOUR Championship and all the only things it brings with it.  What does it mean to you?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It means a lot.  Last season, I really wanted to win in my rookie year and wasn't able to do that.  I guess it wasn't the same season.
Q. Some ups and downs today, what were you telling yourself on 17 before that spectacular birdie?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I felt like I was playing great all day.  Besides that first tee shot on 1, where I pulled it right of the tree, I felt like I was in control of my ball.  We kept our heads down.  I didn't even -- when I was signing my card, I was like, Oh, wow, I actually went birdie, birdie to get in the playoff.  I was just in my own world out there.
Q. Who do you have with you this week?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: My whole family.
Q. What does that mean to you, to have them with you?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It means a lot.  You know, it was my birthday this week.  A lot of guys talk about the Asian stretch, and to have my family out here, especially with the win, it's really special.
