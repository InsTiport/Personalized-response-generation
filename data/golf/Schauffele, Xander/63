Q. WGC - HSBC Champion.  How does that sound?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Has a nice ring to it.
Q. Nice battle with Justin and Tony?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I said earlier, it was as nice of a final group as I've ever played in, not that I've played in a whole lot but Rosey and Tony are great guys and you know, I think we were genuinely pulling for each other, even though we were playing against each other.  My hat's off to both of them.
Q. Was there a particular moment in the round you thought --
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Honestly, no, up until late, when I made that birdie on 17, I felt like we had a good chance, and just happy to pull it off.
Q. Must be nicer with your parents here?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, the Asian Swing, it's a long one, and having my family here is definitely a contributing factor just to make me feel a little more at home.
