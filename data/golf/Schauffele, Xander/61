 Q.  You bogey the first hole.  The last 17 you're 12-under.  That kind of spur things, didn't it?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I guess you can call it that.  Some great rounds have been started by a bogey so I figured why not do it.   
 Q.  How good does this one feel because coming from behind five behind to start the day, you bogey No. 1.  This is an incredible day for you.  It has to be one of the best rounds you've ever played?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it's better far, I mean it's by far the best final round I ever played, I can tell you that much.  We just have this, I played with Leish yesterday.  We got in a good rhythm.  Unfortunately he didn't have the putts going.  I think I stole all the birdies away from him today.  But he's an awesome guy to play with and him and Matty were super relaxed and kind of kept me cool the whole time.   
 Q.  The eagle at 12.  When you clipped that wedge, did you know it was going to be that good?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I mean you just hope as golfers.  The hole's not very big, so we're hitting a similar number on the range, funny enough this morning, and figured might as well do it again.   
 Q.  17, nobody birdied it before you threw it in there seven feet and rolled it in.  That was a heck of an iron shot.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it's, I knew Gary, I knew I was behind.  Gary had like a 60-yard shot on 16, so I was looking at the pin even though it was tucked way over there and we just knew it was going to be a birdiefest coming in.   
 Q.  And 18, that second shot.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I obviously was a little upset with the putt.  I was very nervous, strangely, we're in Hawaii here, I figured I would have the aloha vibes and be chill but my hands were quite shaky and probably had the worst stroke of the day unfortunately.  But Gary was kind enough to let me off easy.
