  XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, just need a goodââ weather should be nice. Of course the greens are finally in good condition, and it's good to be able to play the weekend. 

Q. The feelings you have before coming out on the weekend, do you thing something is going to happen Saturdayââ 
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I need to play a good round this afternoon. I think that's first things first, and if I'm able to do that, then I think Sunday will be a little bit more fun. 

Q. Talking about the greens, does them being somewhat faster make it easier for you? 
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It's always easier to go from fast to slow than slow to fast. Unfortunately the weather wasn't kind to Augusta here, and the greens showed it. Teeing off in the afternoon yesterday was a different story than this morning.
