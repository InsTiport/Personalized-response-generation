Q. Xander, it's hard to win out here. How would you describe what it's like coming down the stretch in one of these?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It's special. I felt like I was in control from the beginning. This guy gave me a few gifts early which I was happy to take advantage of, and he made that long putt on 10. I kept telling Austin, get ready for every sporting event, game, there's always a turning moment where the opposition tries to push. Just make sure we're ready for it.
Q. You used the word "stressful." You seem calm on the outside. What's going on inside?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Panic. At certain points, it wasn't the picturesque finish I wanted. This guy had an amazing eagle on 15, and 16, I think I hit a camera guy and lost 40 yards off my tee ball. It was kind of a stressful finish for a rookie, but glad I could 2-putt a 10-footer.
