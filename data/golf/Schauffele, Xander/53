 Q.  You and I were just joking 67 (indiscernible) tomorrow, but we've got a long way to go to try and catch Brooks.  But talk a little bit about the course today versus the first two days, what to expect as these leaders come in.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Expect the same from the top, I'd say.  I think I'll have a chance to come in second place, but Brooks, yeah, he's taking the tournament by the neck.  I don't see him giving up either.   
 Q.  At all.  Were you shocked when he came in with that 63?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: No.  I think it seems like the course has got easier ever since he shot 63.  People are talking about how it made others believe that it's doable.  I guess doable isn't the right word, it hasn't really been done yet again.  So he's just doing his thing, and everyone else is chasing.   
 Q.  What are you going to work on today on the range.  Driving accuracy obviously is a premium, but so is distance.  Are you just going to take a break or go out there and practice?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I'm done.   
 Q.  I get it.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: This is the walk in the park here, Bethpage.  I doubt there's too many guys beating balls after a round or putting too much.  It's a hike out there and we just try and recover and do our thing tomorrow.   
 Q.  You've improved that each of the two days since Thursday.  Are you feeling more comfortable here, or is that not possible here?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I don't know.  I feel like I'm playing okay.  I don't know if the tournament is just less fun because I'm 15 shots back or what it is.  But it's very melancholic after today I'd say, just because every time I look up, I'm 10 to 12 back.  So no one likes to play for second, but that's sort of what he's doing to us.   
 Q.  Is that an odd sensation, maybe top 5 by the end of the day?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Not very excited?  I mean, yes.  It is a weird thing.  This is a major championship, and everyone is here to win, but there's only one guy who's absolutely just destroying this place.  So I'm sure he's having a blast.  But for the rest of us, he's making it awfully boring.   
 Q.  What have you done extra to (indiscernible)?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Just stay patient.  I've been sort of fighting my swing a little bit, hitting -- I'm making random putts but missing every putt that I should make.  So it's been a bit frustrating.  But I just sort of have a bit of a care-free attitude and sort of plunking along.
