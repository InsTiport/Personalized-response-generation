Q. Clean card today for you, Xander.  Must be pleased.
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, absolutely.  Go bogey-free on this property is always a nice thing.  Happy to be playing pretty good golf at the right time.
Q. What is it about this golf course that brings out your strengths?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It's hard.  Got to do everything pretty well.  Got to be decent at every aspect and not have too many holes in your game.  Right now it's been playing a little easier with the softer conditions but, you know, if you're not square off the tee, you will be struggling.
Q. How much do the softer conditions help you?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It helps everyone.  Even if you're in trouble, if you short-side yourself, kind of get away with it a little bit.  Right now I think it's starting to firm up with the breeze but just helps the whole field.  You know, you can miss it in a few more spot versus if it was firm.  That's sort of what makes it a little bit easier.
Q. What kind of things do you need to get better at for the weekend?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Nothing.  I think I'm doing all the right things.  I've missed two short putts.  That's all I can really think of the last two days, 3 and a 4-footer, something like that.
If you do that, I'm right there and I think if I just kind of stayfresh mentally and keep doing what I'm doing, I'll be in a good spot.
