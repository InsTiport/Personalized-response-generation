 Q.  Let's first talk about today; three times you had it to 15-under and I thought you had some momentum. Analyze today.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I hit it horrible. I scrambled. I hung in there, and I played with Rory earlier, and he was actually -- besides the hole-in-one, I hit it pretty bad this morning, as well. It's one of those things, my game just wasn't sharp enough at the right time, and I don't really have too many complaints. Made some good saves and just fought all day.   
 Q.  Talk about the season; I was with you in Maui when you won the Sentry Tournament of Champions. You played consistently well all season. Are you pleased?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, having a chance to win with all of this, I would chalk that up as a success, so no complaints.   
 Q.  How would you assess the week as a whole?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It was fun. There was plenty of excitement today. The heart rate was up for most of the round. I thought the course was set up really fair, and if you were in the fairway, it was gettable; and if you weren't, it was exactly what you thought it was. It was just a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Driving, missing some fairways there?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I think Paul and I collectively hit -- we hit the last two, which was a blessing, but I think I hit five or something like that today. That putt on the last would have been nice. I would be a little happier talking to you now, but if somebody told me I was going to shoot even par, hitting five fairways around this property on a Sunday, I'd probably take it.
