Q. Xander, how about that birdie on the 18th?  On the tee shot didn't look all that pleased; after the putt it was a different story.
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, like I said earlier, it's one of those embarrassing moments where you kind of scrape one.  I didn't even see where it landed.  Embarrassing, but I got away with it and made the putt.
Q. How were you able to get seven birdies in this, your first competitive appearance at this championship?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: The greens are awesome.  I mean, they were concrete and we got a ton the rain.  Expect them to be much, but I guess they needed some rain because they're absolutely perfect right now.
Q. How thrilled are you to be a part of this event considering what happened to this area?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I'm happy to be part of everything out here on the PGA TOUR.  Rookie, feel very pleased and fortunate to be playing.
