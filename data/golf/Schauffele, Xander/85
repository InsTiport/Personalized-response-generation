 Q.  Congratulations.  These are always tough.  You had an early lead.  You guys battled back and forth and you finished it off here at 17.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it was a pretty exhausting day with the wind up.   
It's cool.  Usually there are waves, either the morning or the afternoon wave.  In match play it's cool, because it doesn't matter when you tee off or what time of day with the wind because everyone has to deal with it.   
 Q.  Sergio is at least going to get a point.  You play him tomorrow.  That's pretty much going to be the match.  This is a big second win for you to come up with two points the first two days.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it's my first time here.  And all the veterans I've talked to told me to sort of hang in there.  Out here it's such a weird course.  Great for match play.  You can win a match at 3-over or lose a match at 5-under.  I've sort of kept that close in my mind and just tried to battle through every match.   
 Q.  How difficult were the conditions with the winds compared to yesterday?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: This hole right here, for example, it's not an easy one.  It's tricky, but the fact that it's match play makes it a little more fun.
