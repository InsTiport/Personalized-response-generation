 Q.  Not sure there's more you could have done today, is there?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: No. Unfortunately a good attitude doesn't make you hit it 350. But I tried, I tried my best. Played great. I did. I beat him on the day just to get in a playoff, and a little bit of déjà vu unfortunately and I couldn't pull it off.   
 Q.  What's it like out there, going head-to-head like that?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, he's great. I would have much rather played a par 3 for a playoff or something. He's the best driver in our game. So if I was a betting man, I probably would have bet on him if we had to play the hole over and over again.   
He's a great guy. Couldn't be happier for him. Like I said, I played great all week; fought. It was nice to have a chance on the back nine.   
 Q.  This is an amazing defence, because you haven't felt well, and when you look at it, there has to be some positives to take out of this.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, Rory, he's an elite player. When he's on, I'd say he's arguably the best player in the world. He made me play better. I played with him in Japan, as well. I think I played six out of eight rounds. So he's made me better during my Asian Swing and I know what I need to do to become a better player.   
 Q.  This bookends a fantastic year and you're up where you belong.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, my time will come. Looking forward to getting healthy. Not coughing. Sleeping. More important things than trying to win a golf tournament.   
But no, it was a lot of fun and I'm glad I tried to put on a show for everyone out here.
