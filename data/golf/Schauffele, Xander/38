Q. You're not the fittest human being at the moment but you got it around really well, didn't you?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I take that personally. Yeah, you hear from the voice, a little out of it, but Rosey and Rory are great guys. Lordy and Harry are great guys. My guy is all right. You know, Austin helped me a lot today, kept me cool and made a few putts which I had to do, someone tells me to shoot 66 for the first round of the week, I think I'd take it.
Q. Some nice putts when you got it going?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it was nice, a few 35-footers, 40-footers. I felt like I was going to make anything. The greens are perfect. My whole goal was to keep it out of the rough and hit it anywhere on the green and kind of get into my round. I didn't have any practice. I didn't play the Pro-Am. I didn't play any practice round. I was just trying to ease my way into the round and luckily I did.
Q. It's quite special being here. The crowds are quite vocal and get excited. Playing on a beautiful golf course in beautiful weather. If you do get fitter, it could be special again.
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Maybe I should just keep my flu going and if I can rattle off a 66 every day, I think that would be enough.
I think a couple more nights of sleep, I'll be in better shape. But it was a dream start with what things were looking like.
