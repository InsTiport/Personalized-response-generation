Q. Nice round today. 
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Thank you. 

Q. What was the feeling like out there?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It was awesome. I think on the 7th hole I told my caddie how cool, one of my favorite things about being on a property the size of Augusta is just the roar through the trees.
I made some birdies coming in, which was nice.

Q. What were the key shots?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I don't know, I mean collectively I felt like I did well all around. It was a bit soft so you could be a bit more aggressive on your landing areas and zones. I felt like yesterday I missed the putts I was supposed to make. And today I made most of the putts I was supposed to make. So much cleaner round.

Q. What's been the experience around here for you last year? How quickly did you feel like you picked things up?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it's a slow learning curve, honestly. Every day you come out here you learn more about the slopes and sort of where you can hit it when it's soft. Where you can hit it when it's firm. And fortunately last year was a bit firmer, and this year it's a bit softer.

Q. More comfortable here, being here?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, being on property and just even being more familiar with the guys out here and not being too star struck by the property. Really my first year out here, Augusta National, first Masters, there's so much noise around just trying to play golf. And this year I felt I did a better job sort of hushing it down and sticking to ready golf. 

Q. What was it like playing with Tiger in the field?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It was awesome. It was his fault for all the roars, he was the guy causing us all the problems. It was cool. It's awesome to see him playing well. And everyone out here is a huge Tiger fan. They changed the number up on the board two holes ahead when we're trying to putt. So I thought it was quite comical. And it was cool to see the environment with him in it.

Q. The roars for your birdies were a little different than his?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I just thought since I was tapping in for birdies, two putt birdies aren't that exciting, but I'll take it all day. 

Q. Did the feel more comfortable today?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, of course, you know, a little bit, yeah. I think whenever you do sort of fire off a bunch of birdies like I did today you sort of lose track with where you're at.

Q. How much does the experience help?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: A lot. It's great‑‑ it's hard to get in the zone. Once you start firing off birdies and not looking back, it's great.
