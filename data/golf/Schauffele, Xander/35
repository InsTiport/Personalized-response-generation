 Q.  You closed it out on 17. How important was every match in the afternoon, but especially your match today?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, you can tell the mood out here and the points swinging on the board, this way or that way. We were just trying to keep our heads down all day and do our job.   
 Q.  The momentum seemed to shift yesterday afternoon heading into this morning. Do you feel the same thing happening in the afternoon session today?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: A little bit. We'll seal how cane cane a little bit. We'll see how these matches end up. I think our backs are still going to be against the wall and we're going to have that mind-set going out tomorrow, but I think it's another day for us to see the golf course, adjust to the time zone and we're going to come out tomorrow and we're going to be rested and we're going to know exactly what we're doing.   
 Q.  You'll be playing on your own tomorrow after playing with a partner all week. What kind of mentality do you bring to the singles competition?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I'm going to miss my boy over here. We've spent a lot of time together and it's been very enjoyable. Solo golf is what we're used to doing and we're looking forward to it.
