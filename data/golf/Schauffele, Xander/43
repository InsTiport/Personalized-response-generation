 Q.  A wonderful round of 67 for 14-under. Give us your thoughts on your play today.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It was okay. You know, I played with Rory. I felt like he hit it much better than I did, and he had a lot more opportunities than I did. Fortunately, I sort of capitalized when I needed to. Obviously, the one sticks out there, and sometimes it's just your day.   
 Q.  How would you describe that from your point of view?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Obviously I turned away. I pulled it. We were trying to go just left of that tower right there, and I probably tugged it a couple yards in there. Just a dream shot, I guess. The one here on No. 9 is no gimme.   
 Q.  It's your first in your career?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: First ever, yeah, so happy it's in competition.   
 Q.  Obviously Rory looks as pleased as you do with the hole-in-one. You were actually saying, sit a little bit in the air, so --  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, because I pulled it, so I figured it might go a little long, but it turned out all right.   
 Q.  Let's have a look at 17. Obviously every shot crucial at this stage.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, absolutely, just a good number is what it was. Had about 144, just a stock wedge, pretty simple putt. I felt like it was -- out here when you have a downhill putt, you don't have to do much to it. Just read it right and it'll go in.   
 Q.  You started the week saying you were keen to take one shot at a time and stay in the present. What about now; how much do you look at leaderboards this afternoon?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Front nine probably not so much. It's pretty bunched up at the top. I'll probably keep my head down until I sort of need to know what's going on. Just try and keep doing what we're doing. I think this afternoon will be the challenge, keep the mind fresh. I have a bit of time before we tee off here in the afternoon, so just try and distract myself to the best of my ability.   
 Q.  How much can you feed off the success that you've had on this golf course before?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it feels good to know that I can get it done. Hopefully the sun comes out so we have sort of the same feeling as two years ago on Sunday, but obviously good memories.   
 Q.  This time the FedExCup is on the line, as well. Last time it was just the TOUR Championship. $15 million and all the things that go with it. How nervous would you be standing over a putt for $15 million.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, if it's on the final hole -- personally I've never gambled for that much in my life, so it would be a first for me. At the end of the day, it's just golf. We're all here to win a tournament and try and do our best. I don't think the money is there as much as just the pure competition.   
 Q.  Let's talk about the 9th, the hole-in-one. Take us through the shot and what you saw from the tee box.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it was a 5-iron, about 240. We wanted to play it probably 222, and I pulled it slightly right at the pin and got a good bounce. I've never had a hole-in-one, so I guess this is how it happens. You've got to get lucky.   
 Q.  So Reavie has got 21, you've got your first.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it's funny enough, it's on the hardest hole out here, arguably.   
 Q.  Thoughts on how you're playing right now and as you head to this final round with a chance to win?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, a little scrappy. I don't know if it was just watching Rory hit and how he flushes it, but I was kind of searching a little bit on the back nine. It was a clean back nine thanks to scrambling and a few putts here and there, but definitely looking forward to doing a bit of range work before I go for the final round.   
 Q.  To confirm, your first-ever hole-in-one, ever?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Ever, yeah.   
 Q.  How does it feel?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Good. It's a great time, as well. In practice rounds I aim away from pins, so that never happens. So it's nice to snatch one out here.   
 Q.  Is that what you said to Rory on the tee right after you made it? You kind of laughed?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: No, he was laughing because I was yelling "softly," and so people always have a little play on with words with my last name, so he thought that was pretty funny.   
 Q.  Marathon day here with so much at stake, so much on the line, what do you prioritize now in between rounds?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Just fortunately got most of my team here, so I can just distract myself for the next couple of hours, but try and refresh. I'm going to probably shower, change my clothes, just act like I didn't wake up at 4:30 this morning, and probably won't take a nap because I haven't taken one since I was six years old. Probably just do anything but golf and just reboot for the afternoon.   
 Q.  Rory says he might do some reading. What might you be doing?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I probably won't be doing reading. Maybe a couple articles on my phone, but yeah, I don't know. Eat, go back to the hotel, I have no idea. We'll figure it out in a little bit.
