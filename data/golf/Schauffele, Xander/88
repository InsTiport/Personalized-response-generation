 Q.  Xander, helluva finish, man.  I guess stuck in neutral, is that fair, for the front side, and then, bang, man, something heated up on the back side.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I think it's just kind of the course.  I was looking at scores earlier, and guys were kind of running off birdies, but our group was kind of, like you said, neutral.  We all stayed patient and hung in there.   
 Q.  You get to 15, and that's where it really fires up.  Four in a row to call it a day.  Was that just a perfect number?  From my vantage point beside the green, I thought you made it for two.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it looked pretty good in the air, but yeah, it was just kind of a stock half wedge, which kind of just was lucky.  With the fairways running out, it's hard to kind of pick your numbers.   
 Q.  How much easier was 17 playing today?  We had a lot of players suggesting that was one of the hardest holes on the golf course yesterday.  Is that just the hole location, or is that a change in wind that made 17 play so much easier?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Probably a change in wind.  Everything kind of runs off from you and the fact that we had more club coming in today, but you can kind of blow up in the wind and stop much faster.   
 Q.  You played your way right into a good position for the weekend.  Is it more of the same or something you'll work on between now and your tee time tomorrow?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Probably more of the same.  Take what the course gives you.  It's just one of those places.  And it's definitely a fun challenge.   
 Q.  Fun to watch.  Exciting finish.  Good luck the rest of the way.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Thank you very much.
