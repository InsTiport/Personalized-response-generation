Q. Tell me about the setup today versus the first couple of days?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Just a progression of the course getting firmer.  The first bounces on the green is a little bit firmer and the rough is the same.  And the wind is about the same, maybe a little bit cooler.  Set up-wise I thought it was really fair.  If you were in the fairway you had a fighting chance, and if you weren't you were playing U.S. Open golf.
Q. How do you feel that your game was today compared to the last couple of days, personally?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Good.  I got in some trouble early and brought it back, which is nice.  Hopefully we can do something mid to low tomorrow, and start to swing back up in there.
