  XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   It was a good day to learn from some mistakes.  Felt like I stayed pretty patient all day, which was good.  Have to continue to stay patient until I can win again.
 Overall I'm playing really well, and I don't see why I can't knock obvious a win soon.
 Q. I firmly believe that every time you put yourself in position the odds say you are going to win if you can just remain patient enough.  You're in the lead.  You're No. 1 in the FedExCup.
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   Yeah.  Sure doesn't feel that way.  You know, it is what it is.  Just going to try and lick my wounds.  I think Brooks is a great example for me.  He hasn't been in great form, missed few cuts, and comes out and wins.
 So there is something to that, something to his recipe, and he's definitely figured it out.
 Q. Today was a little bit more of a grind, especially through the opening six, seven holes.  What was the difficulties out there for you?
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   Yeah, just sort of a slow day.  It was kind of a similar -- I stayed pretty calm.  Similar day to my last two.  Obviously the finish wasn't as sparkling as before.
 Just my group was just kind of slow and stale air.  No one could make any putts, no one was hitting it very close.  Something for me to learn moving forward.  Final group is always tricky and everyone is nervous, and kind of showed in our play.
 Definitely I think wore on all of us unfortunately.
 Q. Seemed like that to me.  You know, you always want to win.  I think everybody out here wants the opportunity.  You had it; didn't get it.  How frustrated are you right now that you're not winning, but how excited are you that you're playing well?
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   Yeah, talked to my caddie, and I think, for one, congrats to Brooks.  He's a great example.  Won four majors, true champion and it shows.  Hasn't been in great form, comes out here, and wins a tournament.
 There is a lot to be said for him and his recipe for winning.  Me and my team are trying to figure it out ourself.  Another example is Dustin Johnson where he said he hit some of the worst shots he's hit in his career and walks out of there with a two-shot win.
 So, you know, I'm excited I'm playing well.  I think the game is getting to a better level.  Today just a few short game shots that kind of cost me, and I think that's the big hole in my game.  It has been my whole career, and I think it still is a little bit of a hole.
 Q. (In progress.)
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   Yeah, frustration.  Congrats to Brooks.  Like I said over there, he's a good example for me.  He hasn't been in great form, comes out here, is feeling better, wins a golf tournament.
 I think there is a lot to be said by his actions and how he played.  There is a reason he's knocked off a bunch of majors.  That's something I'm trying to do.  I need to learn from a recipe like his.
 Overall, I'm playing good golf.  I'm disappointed.  I heard Jordan say that me and him could have made it a two-man race.  If you told me I would shoot 2-under par out here to win the golf tournament, you know, it's very doable after the first three rounds that I played.
 Winning is tough.  I'll lick my wounds and come back.
 Q. Was part of it that nobody in your group had anything going from the start?
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   For sure.  On the last hole I joked with Jordan, We did it again.  Wasn't quite the 42 -- pair of 42s on the front nine like the British, but we sort of just -- you know final groups, I've been in a couple, not many, not enough, they get a little nervous.  People kind of play a little safe.  Not hitting their putts hard enough.
 It wore on our whole group.  Putts were lipping out, miss-clubbing, kind of weird shots, and it just wasn't the same feel the first couple days.  I tried to stay patient and do my own thing, but definitely helps when someone is playing well.
 Q. Was there a shot on the back nine where you felt you kind of really didn't have a chance anymore?
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   Yeah, I hooked a 3-wood on 17 in the water.  Kind of -- yeah, that was sort of it.  I really needed to hit that one on the green and two-putt to give myself a chance at least.  That's where my head was.  Got quick and forced it.
 I can deal with that.  I think it started on 6 when I had a lob wedge from 94 yards and I made a bogey.  Stuff like that, I got to stay calm, patient.  I tried to lick my wounds and I miss-clubbed on the next hole.  So bogey, bogey there was sort of the stupid and immature, but I'll just learn from it.
 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   7 was 6.  Scottie and Jordan hit 6-iron.  I hit a 6-iron that looked pretty good.  Came up short.  Kind of had a down cut, but hit the right club it would've been fine.
