 Q.  You seem to have the game for the U.S. Open.  You've done well the last couple years.  What motivates you when you come into this event?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I feel like, you know, a lot of guys have a game.  It's just sort of being able to turn off your brain at certain times is sort of the trick, I think, for U.S. Opens.  It's super easy to get pissed off and hit good shots that end up horribly and make a double for no reason.  I feel like I've learned to accept certain things and sort of keep my head down the whole day.   
 Q.  After your success at the U.S. Open last year, did it give you more confidence, and did you have any expectations about Shinnecock Hills coming in here?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, last year was a springboard into my career, last year's U.S. Open.  This year, you always tee it up to win, and I got off to a decent start in Round 1, sort of fell apart in Round 2, and I'm happy with how I finished on the weekend, to be honest.   
It was a completely different U.S. Open if you compare the last two years.  I shot 10 under last year and 6 over this year, and I'm not going to finish too far apart in positioning in the field.  So yeah, you hope for the best.   
 Q.  How much better (no microphone)?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Man, it's hard to say.  I missed a couple of short putts early, but I made a couple U.S. Open nine, ten-foot par putts.  So I would have liked to have one more.  That would have been nice.  I missed like a five-footer on 15 that was pretty easy.  Besides that, you know, I'll take the day.   
 Q.  Did your approach change any, given that the leaders by the end of yesterday, had come back?  Did you change your attitude and approach anything --  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Absolutely.  I never thought I had a chance to win today, you know.  Tommy's a great example of doing what we all, you know, slept on and dreamed of, you know, posting that score and having these guys fight to come in.   
So obviously, I was watching coverage earlier, and, you know, a lot of players were complaining.  The course did get a little tricky yesterday with some pin locations.  When I looked at the sheet this morning and sort of some conditions earlier on TV, it did seem a little bit easier, you know.  Irons were stopping on greens.  It wasn't the same day as yesterday.   
So I knew that -- I didn't see a 7 under, to be honest, but I knew, you know, it was going to be hard to catch the leaders for sure.   
 Q.  Did the winds pick up as you were finishing up, or did they remain pretty much the same?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It remained pretty constant throughout the whole day.  The 12:45 tee time is sort of breezy throughout your entire round.  So we were expecting it.   
 Q.  Thank you.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Thank you.
