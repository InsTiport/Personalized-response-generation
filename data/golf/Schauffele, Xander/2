  Q. Thoughts on the opening match?
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   Yeah, it was a bit scrappy.  He played pretty clean.  I think he parred every hole.  I think he did.  So I was a bit all over the place.
 So at one point I was 3-down and if someone told me I was going to tie the match I would probably take it.  So it is what it is, and we'll try and clean it up coming in.
 Q. How are you feeling about your game coming into the week?  Pretty good?
 XANDER SCHAUFFELE:   It's okay.  Yeah, I've been working pretty hard at it.  Just I think I hit a few nice shots on the back nine which is a little promising, so we'll get to it right now and clean everything up for the next two days.
