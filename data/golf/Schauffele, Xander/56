Q. How would you assess your round out there today?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Similar to yesterday, but you know how golf goes. A bit sloppy yesterday and much cleaner today. 

Q. Conditions when you came back out, how did you find the conditions when you came back out?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Right when they called us off it was very calm and there was about zero wind. So we were all sort of excited to start attacking just after Amen Corner, but they pulled us off and it was a little breezy right when we got back out, a little tricky winds just from the storm, but you look around right now there's not a breath of wind, so it was definitely scoring conditions.

Q. You're one back heading into the weekend. What can you draw on from the past Sundays or experiences you had at major championships recently? Can you draw on those as you go into this weekend?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, you know, a few here and there. This is only my second Masters, definitely a new experience for me here and I'm looking forward to playing the weekend. 
But I think I'll just have to draw on all the memories from other tournaments. I've been in the mix a few times Thursday and Friday, but tomorrow's moving day and there's going to be some low numbers out there.

Q. What's your mentality as you play tomorrow? Do you be a little bit more aggressive or do you kind of see where things are going and know where to pick your spots, when to be aggressive?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, unfortunately there's a leaderboard on almost every hole so you can always know where you're standing amongst the leaders.
And I think we'll just have to first stick to our own‑‑ old cliche‑‑ stick to your own game plan and keep your head down. It's only Saturday tomorrow, so we'll keep‑‑ Austin and I, my caddie, we'll stick to our game plan and kind of see where we can get.
