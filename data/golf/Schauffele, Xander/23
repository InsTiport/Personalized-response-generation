Q. Talk about going bogey free today.
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It's about controlling it off the tee. The rough is kind of wispy. It was hard to judge this morning, it was wet. And then afternoon, drying off nicely. It was hard to -- just got to keep it in the fairway. J.T. is throwing tees at me, so that's probably the biggest challenge of the day so far.
Q. How do you assess your round today?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Bogey-free. Bogey-free was great. I thought really with the wet rough, it was important to keep it out of it, and then once it dried up, you've got to guess if it's going to fly or come out as a dud. I was in the fairway for the most part, and when I was in the rough it was with a wedge, so not too much stress coming into greens, which was probably the key to the bogey-free round.
Q. How would you assess the interruption to your season with these last 90 days, coming in without much rust?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I felt like I was playing really good right at THE PLAYERS when the season stopped, and it was sort of one of those things, I think everyone dealt with it in their own way, and I wasn't upset that I was stuck at home. We don't really get three months off just randomly, so I sort of tried to turn it into a positive and stay productive at home, and I was able to play a lot of golf through that last month of the quarantine. I felt like I was really productive and feel pretty good about it now.
Q. How happy are you to be back out here today and atop the leaderboard?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, really happy. It's nice to see the guys. J.T. was throwing tees at me earlier while trying to do this interview, but this is sort of what you miss. Golf is an individual sport or game, and we don't really have the locker room interaction that other teams have, but sort of just seeing your buddies out here and doing what we love to do is always a nice thing.
Q. Preparing for tomorrow, is there anything that you'll be fine tuning in your practice?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: No, I think bogey-free is good. It's definitely something to try and repeat. It's obviously a hard thing to repeat, but just keeping it in front of me. It's been a while since we've had to play under any sort of pressure besides what we try and emulate at home. But just kind of deal with that and kind of do what we've been doing.
