 Q.  Other than one wayward swing out there on the 5th, other than that, I saw a really good golf game.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it was, overall, it was pretty much that one swing that kind of got me in trouble and then after that I had a lot of birdie looks and didn't make any, but no complaints, really.   
 Q.  I'm always interested as to how players bounce back after a double bogey.  Tend to carry a lot of mental baggage with that.  You kept firing at flags, had a lot of opportunities.  I saw a lot of pull of the valley out here, a putt losing on the low side.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it was my first time out here and the greens are perfect, so you definitely get a little more anxious when you hit it to 10, 12 feet and feel like you should make everything, but still got a couple more days.   
 Q.  First time playing this event, what kind of energy is out there with these crowds?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It's awesome.  Playing with Jon Rahm, No. 2 ranked player in the world, and Phil Mickelson both local guys -- I guess Jon's not local, but he went to school out here at ASU -- so they're screaming their names a lot and I definitely tried to -- I'm not from here, but I definitely tried to feed off the vibe they were giving those guys.   
 Q.  What is that vibe like when you have the support for them but also maybe a little bit of competition amongst the group itself?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: It's cool.  I think all of us, every player, no one would come play here if we didn't think the fans and everyone else was awesome, so it's just a special week.   
 Q.  How satisfied are you with your opening round?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I never played here and had a little hiccup there mid round and fought back, didn't make any birdies, but had some looks, so 3-under, I don't know what place I'm in, but I'll take it.
