 Q.  Can you just talk about your round today?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it was an interesting one. Probably the first time I can say that I'm very stoked to have a delay. I came back out swinging it much better than I did on the front nine. So it was a nice reset. I felt like I could have -- for how hard East Lake is, I gave myself a lot of good looks, uphill looks, and I didn't make too many putts. It was nice to finish birdie, eagle.   
 Q.  What are you thinking about going into this weekend?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I'll keep my same mentality. I'll keep my head down. I saw a few more leaderboards today than I did yesterday. I'll keep my head down and try to have a look maybe back nine tomorrow and starting off on Sunday. Maybe we can try to get ourselves in good position for that.
