 Q.  Xander, 63, 64 and now 67 today.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah.  It was a gloomy day, very wet.  But, you know, still have a good chance tomorrow and it was good.  Rosie and Keegan and I sort of got it going early and sort of -- I guess Rosie got it going early.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: We played relatively clean golf for the most part so he definitely got off early and to a hot start.  One to chase.   
 Q.  This is not Southern California.  What was the outlook as we look into tomorrow, potentially?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I have no idea.  I have to look at the Weather Channel and see what's going on.  Kind of the same thing.  Everyone is dealing with the weather in their ways and we'll do the same.   
 Q.  I'm sure you're feeling good about your game.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Not too bad.  Wouldn't mind hitting some balls right now.  That won't happen.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: You know, I guess I hung in there.  I haven't played the cleanest of weekends, I was very aware of that going into the weekend.  I'm happy to have a chance tomorrow.   
 Q.  What would you say was not clean about your weekend?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I was kind of hitting it here and there.  Fairways are big enough to hit it well and find some spots here.  Irons are good.   
 Q.  Give me one thing you're committed to in the final round.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: About my game?   
 Q.  Anything.  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Anything?  Sort of committed to -- I think the biggest thing I took from the beginning of this week was trying to make as many -- the least amount of mistakes.  I'm tired right now.  I feel like I've been grinding more this year.  Try to play well tomorrow and I'll really be happy.   
 Q.  Is it going to be difficult to prepare for a final round when you're not entirely sure when you might play that final round?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah.  I haven't dealt with that too often.  Usually Tour stops are relatively nice but everyone is dealing with the same thing.  We'll wake up and see what the Tour texts us.
