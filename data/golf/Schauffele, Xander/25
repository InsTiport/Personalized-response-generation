Q. What's the mentality going into tomorrow on a course that's going to give up a lot of birdies?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, stay patient early. I'm chasing, so it's kind of a comfortable spot I would say. Probably keep my head down the first, I don't know, seven or eight holes, there's a nice big board on 9 so I'll probably peak then. But if I can get off to a good start, 2, 5, those are pretty hard holes coming in, 6 can be tricky if you're out of position off the tee. So 7 being a long par-3, I'm not sure about the tee box. So those are probably hard holes to birdie, but not too hard to par, I would say, so it all depends on what the leaders are doing.
Q. Tony and Jon both thought 20 might be the number tomorrow. Do you have any idea in your head?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: You know, I'm sure Tony's just being nice. If he puts together a nice mid 60s round I think it will be a little bit lower than 20. He's more than capable of doing it. I'll just have to sort of, like I said, kind of keep my head down early, if I can shoot 3- or 4- on the front, kind of scare someone a little bit and see what we can do on the back.
Q. Between you, Tony and Webb there's been a lot of great golf in the last few months, but a lot of near misses. Do you make anything of that as you go into Sunday or does that change the mentality at all?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: No, it's not really something we think about. I think we're just trying our best and trying to give yourselves a chance. So I'm sure there's a bunch more names sort of in between me and tony as of right now, I don't even know what position I'm in right now, I just need to have a look.
