 Q.  Pleased with that 69?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, it was good. I was 1-over on the front nine, and was not looking like a real golfer, or at least a professional golfer on that front stretch. Happy that my feet got under me on the back nine, and just sort of had a little bit of a better time.   
 Q.  Not the position you want to be in, feeling ill, but are you surprised at the energy you've got to keep going?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Yeah, I have a really good caddie and a good team. They have been pushing me to the start line and help me get to the finish line. I keep telling my caddie, keep telling me what to do and I'll do my best to do it.   
 Q.  How fantastic would it be to defend this title?  
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: : It would be very special. Screw the circumstances; I've been preparing all year, and I've looked forward to coming back here all year. I'm not going to let the flu get my hopes down.
