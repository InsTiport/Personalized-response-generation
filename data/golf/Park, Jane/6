Q. Awesome round.  It seems like you caught fire on the back nine.  What was working well for you out there?
JANE PARK: Yeah, I just stayed really patient because I've been hitting the ball really well all week, but not many putts were falling.  A few chips went in, and I just got lucky on a couple of those chips because some of those lies are brutal out there.
Q. What were the three birdies you had in a row there?  15, 16, 17?
JANE PARK: 15, the par-3, I hit a 7-wood to two feet, and then the next hole, I hit a 7-iron to about four feet and then chipped in again on number 17.
Q. So you got to 9-under par for the tournament.  That's going to set you up for probably your best finish in quite some time.  How does that feel?
JANE PARK: Yeah, it's been a struggle.  The game has lots of up-and-downs, but I guess just staying patient like I said earlier.  It's really rewarding when you finally get a few good rounds under your belt.
Q. Does this give you momentum for the rest of the season?
JANE PARK: Absolutely.  I'm very excited for the rest of the season.
