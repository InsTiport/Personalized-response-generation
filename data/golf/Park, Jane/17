  Q. Overall just your thoughts on the way you were able to open up going 2-under today?   
 JANE PARK: The course is very difficult. It's very hard.   
 The ball is running out a lot, and you really have to know where to hit it on these greens, and I think I did a pretty good job of that today.  
  
  Q. Overall pretty happy with the way you were able to open up day one?  
 JANE PARK: Yes. Very happy with the way I was able to play today, and hopefully I can just keep the trend going.  
  
  Q. What did you like about your game today?  
 JANE PARK: I was able to really focus on just my targets, and there were a couple distractions out there, a couple people watching and making some noise, but I was able to focus on the shot that was at hand.  
  
  Q. Was it what you expected it to be after seeing the last couple of days?  
 JANE PARK: Yeah, definitely. I know the golf course is going to harden up the more the wind picks up, so I'm looking for a harder course tomorrow.  
  
  Q. How tough is that to leave that out there, to end a round like that?  
 JANE PARK: Yeah. I had a lot of bad breaks today. I hit a ton of good drives that ended up in heavy cut of rough, but tomorrow I'll try to make up for that last putt right there.  
  
  Q. Is that the toughest part, the roll of the fairways, finding the rough?  
 JANE PARK: Yeah. You know, the fairways really fall to where the ball is landing, so you really have to -- sometimes you have to hit 3-wood. Sometimes you have to lay back, but I did a pretty good job of that.
