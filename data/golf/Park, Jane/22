  Q. What's been the difference for you?  
 JANE PARK: I've been struggling with my putting for a couple months but I was able to drop a couple early and that got my round going.   
  
  Q. Has there been a consistent aspect to your game?  
 JANE PARK: I would say my iron shots have been pretty good this week. You can't really score if your irons aren't very precise, should I say, but my irons are good, and off the tee I'm pretty consistent, too. It's just all the putting out here with all of these goods.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about what the difference has been in your game between this year and your rookie year last year?  
 JANE PARK: I think I definitely feel a little more comfortable out here. I'm kind of used to the people out here and the schedule that the LPGA runs on.   
 But now I'm a little more used to how things work out here, so I've become a little more myself now.   
  
  Q. Is there a certain confidence that comes from having been a medalist?   
 JANE PARK: Yeah, I proved to myself that I can play well straight off the bat early on, and I'm just trying to feed off of that right now, and you know, tomorrow and for the rest of the year, I just want to play consistent golf.   
  
  Q. How confident do you feel that you can be in the mix in the winner's circle tomorrow?  
 JANE PARK: If I put the way I did today, then I think I'll have a good shot.  
  
  Q. Do you think you're ready for that?  
 JANE PARK: Yes, I am.
