Q. Jane, great round; 7-under.  You had a chance get it to 8.  How did you feel out there?
JANE PARK: I felt really comfortable today.  Just started with a new caddie, his name is Rocky, and we make a really good team.  Really happy about that.
Q. What's Rocky's last name?
JANE PARK: Rocky Venn, yeah.
Q. Nice.  And you had an eagle on the 16th hole after a couple bogeys --
JANE PARK: Yeah, yeah.
Q. -- so that had to feel good.
JANE PARK: Yeah, definitely.  That was kind of a bummer that I bogeyed two in a row.  Great to get it back with a great hole on 16.
It was about 82 yards, I want to say.
Q. What was the club?
JANE PARK: It was like a 54 degree wedge.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
JANE PARK: Yeah, it was about ten feet and it had about three cups of break and it was straight up the hill.  I didn't want it get away from me so I didn't put that much of a confident stroke on it.
But, yeah, couple more days.
Q. When you have a round like that, are you having fun or wait until afterwards to have fun?
JANE PARK: You know, I'm having fun.  Obviously really good team with Rocky on the bag and we have some good chatter out there.  That always helps.
Yeah, that's my main goal:  to try to have fun.
Q. How did you end up together, you and Rocky?
JANE PARK: I actually talked to a couple other caddies and he was available, so it worked out in my favor.
Q. Cool.  Awesome.  Thank you.
JANE PARK: Thanks, guys.
