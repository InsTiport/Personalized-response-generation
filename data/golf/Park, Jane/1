Q. Alongside Jane Park, who just shot her career low at the Cambia Portland Classic in her 13th appearance, and Jane, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit off the coast of Portland, and you made an earthquake of your own, eagling your first hole this morning. What got you off to such a strong start?
JANE PARK: I actually had a perfect number on the first hole and it was a pitching wedge from about 112 yards, and I actually didn't know if it went in, but I heard it hit the flag, so my playing partners raised their hands and started clapping. I had no idea. But yeah, that was a really nice way to start the round, and the greens were honestly so pure today, so it was a good start.
Q. How does it help to have the greens rolling so purely?
JANE PARK: Well, the greens were pure, but also on my first nine, on the back nine, I had a few kick-in birdies, so that really helped, and obviously on the back nine I had a few birdies and they were a bit lengthy, but I was able to make a few there, too.
Q. You also made a few birdies in your first round in Scotland, where you shot a 63. First rounds have been treating you well recently. What is it about an opening round of a tournament that lets you play so well?
JANE PARK: I'm not sure. I really like the Scottish Open, and I obviously love the Canadian Open, and this is pretty much my favorite spot of the entire year because there's obviously so much great food and the golf course is just pristine. I'm super happy to get started off well here for a change.
Q. Of the great food in Portland, which one is your favorite?
JANE PARK: I went to Proud Mary twice yesterday. I'm not proud of that, but I might have to visit that place again today.
