Q. Seems like you got a good start out there, but a hard ending?
ALEX NORÃN: Yeah, I mean, I fought back from a bad 2-over early on, and then I fought back, and then didn't play that good on the back nine.  I had a lot of good chances, and then by 14 or 15, the par 3, I just hit over the green and made bogey.  After that, just they kept coming -- it's tricky around here.  You've got to play well.
Q. And how has this PGA Championship been like?
ALEX NORÃN: Yeah, it's nice.  I mean, the course plays good.  Weather is good.  I just wish I could play better.
Q. European guys tell me a lot about the unity after the Ryder Cup.  Are you still feeling that?
ALEX NORÃN: Yeah, I mean, we don't feel unity out here.  I mean, yeah, they're good friends, but out here you're on your own, and you've got to perform on your own.
Q. I know you had Thomas BjÃ¸rn as a captain at the Ryder Cup.  How was it?
ALEX NORÃN: Yeah, it was good.  I've known him for a long time.  He was a good captain.  He was smart.  He let us play our own game.  He was very good.
