   BIO KIM: I was just there with him last year playing with the Korean tour, and played with him in practice rounds. And obviously they're going to think, oh, if he could do it, why not me.

 Q. Right. 
 BIO KIM: So I'm pretty sure a lot of people are going to try out again this year, and hopefully I stay here.

 Q. Sure. 
 BIO KIM: And hopefully I see a lot of people coming up, too.

 Q. Well, if you have another good round, you'll be set; right?
 BIO KIM: All right. Hopefully.

 Q. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. 
 BIO KIM: You're welcome.

 Q. Kind of new territory for you being in the final group. How did you feel out there and what do you anticipate for tomorrow?
 BIO KIM: Well, the final group on the PGA TOUR, that's always special, and I'm not going to lie, I was nervous playing with Justin Leonard and Henrik Stenson, but I was trying to play my own game, and I think I did a great job today, so hopefully I can do that again tomorrow.

 Q. What do you think you're looking forward to scoring tomorrow to comma way with your first win?
 BIO KIM: First win I would say Justin is playing great, Henrik is playing great. Other people are playing great. So I have to shoot somewhere around 60s to have a chance. 
 But I don't know, winning's -- you don't -- I can't think of the word.

 Q. What would it mean to you to win tomorrow? How would it feel?
 BIO KIM: A lot. I mean a lot of things, but especially in the rookie year winning the PGA TOUR, that would be a special one for me, and I don't know. I haven't thought about it. So just got another 18 holes to go, so just gotta work hard right now.
