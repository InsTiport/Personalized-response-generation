  TRAVIS HILL:   Hello, and welcome to our second press conference of the day at the World Golf Hall of Fame.   We have Colin Montgomerie with us along with Ken Schofield, and I will open the floor for questions. 

Q.   Colin, what's your proudest moment in golf?   Keep it short. 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I'll just pass on to Ken if I need to keep it short.   Most proud of?   That's a good question.   Most proud of, when I think about proud of things, you're proud of records that you reach in one's career, and I suppose seven Money Lists, as you say over here in the States, Order of Merit we call them, but Money Lists here in the States, but seven in a row, that was something that I look back on and realize how special it was now that the guys winning it now seem to be winning it one year and not the next or whatever.
So seven in a row seems to be quite special for some reason.   So I'm probably most proud of that. 
But I look back at my career, I suppose raising the Ryder Cup as captain in 2010, to regain the Ryder Cup from the victory that the States had in 2008, to raise the Ryder Cup was a very proud moment.   It's funny because I never hit a golf shot, and you've asked me what the proudest moment of my career is.   I suppose hitting golf shots got me to that stage, but without hitting a golf shot, raising the Ryder Cup I suppose has to be. 

Q.   Were the seven Order of Merits something that you appreciated year to year or not until after you did it?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I started to appreciate it when I didn't win it.   Lee Westwood won it in the year 2000 at Valderrama there when we had our Volvo Masters event.   I only started appreciating it from then on, from the year 2000 onward, did I appreciate what had happened during that time, yeah.

Q.   Did that make the eighth more special?
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Yeah, definitely, to win it again six years later was definitely the most special.   But the seven in a row was like a conveyor belt in many ways.   I couldn't get off it.   I was going to say a treadmill, but I've never been on that. 
Just sort of keep going, and eventually you have four and five and six, and then if I had had to finish second, what would have been a failure, the second best player in Europe over a year isn't all bad.   There's a lot of decent players over there.   So yeah, it was just a conveyor belt really that I couldn't get off. 

Q.   You have an incredible singles record in Ryder Cup.   Why do you think you're such a good, or in the past you have been such a good singles player? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Okay.   One, I hate to lose, and I think that's number one.   I think to win you have to have this fear of losing, and I had a dramatic fear of losing, so that kept me going through the years that Ken here was our boss of the Tour.   It was a good time that we had during that time and continued through George O'Grady's reign.   But at the same time it was a time where Europe started to, I hate to say dominate the Ryder Cup, but certainly win it more than the Americans did, and it was a time where you felt that you were letting down your teammates if you did happen to lose, so therefore you won, really.   I mean, it was as simple as that. 
And I was determined.   I've always been a great competitor, and I was determined to do as much for the team as possible, and it was my job in these Ryder Cups to gain as many points as possible for the team.   As long as we got to 14 and a half points, I was happy, either way it went. 

Q.   This question is for both of you.   First of all, Colin, I'd like to buy you a cocktail tonight.   I've won mucho quid betting on the Europeans in the Ryder Cup over the years, so thank you very much. 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Well, thank you.   I'll take a double of whatever you're having.

Q.   I'll see you tonight, and I definitely will.   And part of it, European Ryder Cup and also the growth of the European Tour relates to my favorite golfer of all time.   Sadly tomorrow is the two‑year anniversary of his death, the great Seve Ballesteros.   Can you tell me how he inspired you as a player, as a representative of Scotland and Europe, and Ken, especially as it relates to the growth of the European Tour, back in the day when maybe Mr.Palmer and some others would play Trophee Lancome and so forth, but all the events in Europe to what has happened over the course of the last 30 years and how tremendous the growth has been and how Seve was such an inspirational part of that for both of you. 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   Well, you mentioned a name there that Seve became, because he quite quickly became Europe's Arnold.   And I think we all feel that.   Colin can speak for those that played with him and against him.   I think many would share that view.   Those of us who had the privilege of working with the fellows knew when he first appeared, from the moment he ran that chip shot through the bunker at Birkdale in '76 running second to Johnny Miller, he very quickly started winning and really never stopped for quite a long period of time. 
And I think it was the way that he did it.   Wherever he played, he became Europe's Arnold.   And I think to say that here, you cannot give a European a higher accolade.   He was a mighty force for golf, and I think that playing with him at that time, that famous five all fed off each other, and my joy this week is to see the gentleman on my left, whom I've always felt and have stated that with JosÃ© MarÃ­a, Colin and JosÃ© MarÃ­a from the bridge from that five to today's Europeans led by Rory. 
And I think all of them have done so much for European and international golf that we're due them all. 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I was just talking about your question regarding Seve, and the honor it was to play alongside him and to play him.   We have a tournament on the Tour, the Seve Trophy, it's now the Vivendi Trophy, but Seve Trophy, which was a match play event between the continent of Europe and Great Britain and Ireland.   I represented Great Britain and Ireland, and I was the captain of that team against Seve's European team, continental Europe team. 
And unfortunately what happened in those days was that the captains played each other, so therefore I had to play Seve.   And out of the three matches, we played together over the six‑year period, he was 2‑1 ahead of me, and he never saw the golf course.   I don't know where he was.   He needed a passport most of the time to find out where he was, and yet he beat me, and it was incredible to witness the passion.   You think that's the word that describes Seve Ballesteros, the passion that he portrayed on the golf course was second to none, and it was an honest play against him, especially now that we can't reenact those particular games. 
And an honor also to play under him when he was captain of the Ryder Cup team in '97 against Tom Kite's American team that was brought over.   A very, very strong American team it was, too, and we managed to win that one under his guidance, and it was an honor to just know him and to be around him. 
So as you say, nearing the second anniversary of his death, he's very sadly missed.

Q.   Ken, could you talk about the importance of not just Seve but Sandy Lyle and Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam? 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   Well, the five of course were those guys, and they all started playing from that mid‑'70s, really, and it was at a time we were trying to grow the Tour and trying really to get a full schedule, which was the role that I had the privilege of filling with an equally talented team outside the ropes.
And not until Seve won at Lytham, a 10‑year gap from Tony Jacklin winning at Lytham, did we begin to really see just how good they were.   And of course they were joined for quite a period by Greg, and for a slightly lesser period by Nick Price, and we know also how long those two gentlemen led the World Rankings, particularly had wonderful success in the game in the United States.
Seve unquestionably, I think Colin would agree, he gave the belief to the others when he won there at Augusta, the first European, quickly followed by Bernhard, and then the Brits had a four‑year run, which if you had said to many people prior to Sandy winning followed by Nick, Nick and Woosie, you'd have been led away in a yellow van.   Now no one is that surprised when you have a Graeme McDowell and a Rory McIlroy winning back‑to‑back U.S. Opens.   And I think that's what that generation and what Colin and Ollie have done for today's players. 

Q.   Would the European Tour look like it does today had it not been for them? 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   Well, you can't really answer that.   You can only say what you know to have had them.   And to have had the calling cards, particularly when they did regain the Ryder Cup in '85, I can remember vividly Lee Trevino saying at the closing press conference that the biggest beneficiary of this week will be the European Tour because unquestionably with added media coverage on all fronts, the corporate sponsors started to come with us, the opportunities for our Tour to travel outside the geographic boundaries of Europe, which was so vital for us then, and even more so today with southern Europe in a real sticky time in terms of the economies, all those things were aided by the success of those players, no question. 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I think you're right, Ken, saying the Arnold Palmer relation to Seve.   Two golfers in the world really have been loved:   Arnold Palmer and Seve Ballesteros.   Other golfers have been respected and fully justifiably so, but two players have really been loved, and Seve is one of them, and you have your own Arnold Palmer here. 

Q.   Would you each take a moment and talk about either the historical or personal significance of one of the items that you've donated to the Hall of Fame for your inductee exhibit? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   My treadmill couldn't fit in there.   I'm still doing widths really.   I haven't started lengths yet.   Historical significance?   Well, I mean, I don't think you've seen an Olympic torch in an exhibition before, and that's something unique, historical, when we had the London Olympics in 2012 and what a success it was and I was asked to carry the torch, and I carried it for 300 meters, which was plenty for me, through the streets of Aberdeen in Scotland there, down Union Street in Aberdeen, and it was a great honor to do that on behalf of golf, which as we know is starting the next Olympic Games, the next one in 2016 in Brazil.
My Walker Cup I suppose has significance going way back.   The Blazer in there is from Sunningdale in 1987, but I played twice in the Walker Cup, 1985 at Pine Valley and 1987 at Sunningdale, and they were great matches, and I'm so glad that that game continues and goes from strength to strength, very much so.   It's a great sounding board to what you might expect to happen in other team events in professional golf. 
They're the two items that really have historical note for me in there.   Of course there's the Ryder Cup captain's bag and all the Ryder Cup stuff.   But historically they're the two things that mean the most to me. 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   I wasn't really too certain, but I think Colin would agree we were enormously helped by the whole‑‑ we sent a wonderful gentleman to homes in England in Colin's case and in Scotland to sit with us to take a rake through our respective dens, and of course in mine you wouldn't find any sensible golf clubs, although in fairness perhaps one club, a Jerry Barber Golden Touch sand iron may one day find its way here, and that will then tell everyone who has always wondered and said, why is there no film of Ken's swing.   Jerry Barber was a great champion.   I had the privilege of meeting him before he passed one year at the Masters because George O'Grady and Richard Hill said Ken is here and Ken is the only one in Europe that plays your club because he has the worst shank in European golf.   So maybe that club should come over and find its way in the hall one day. 
But I think maybe two things:   Trophy given to me by the players and the committee and the board of the European Tour when I finished is in there, and the citations, you might need a magnifying glass to really read all of them, particularly through the glass, but the citations that I have both digitally and in print back home which are on that trophy from many of the guys, Colin included, who won Orders of Merit, who played in Ryder Cups and who won major championships is very special to me, together with a general book that includes letters from all, including Arnold and Gary and many on the European Tour, Adam Scott, who's just become golf's latest major champion, and many guys that would have caddied or volunteered on our Tour during my 30 years.   All of them are very special to me. 

Q.   Ken, your tenure from 1975 to 2004 leading the European Tour, I wonder if you could share with us what you feel was the recipe for success for the Tour to become what it is today, and then a second question tethered to that if I may, talk to us as well about the growth of the Ryder Cup from 1979 to today. 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   I think if there's one answer to your first question, it's the fact that the European and international players were very‑‑ they were very prepared to travel.   Now, we could say that was out of necessity, something that the United States‑based players really have never needed to do and today still don't because of the magnitude of golf in the United States and the strength of the PGA TOUR, and with three of golf's four majors being played here. 
But from the moment that we went outside Europe and new generations of players came, our Tour became very international, and I think Colin would agree; if you are a young Swede, Spaniard, Irishman, Scotsman or Englishman or any of the other European countries, and you travel to play with South Africans in their own backyard and the Aussies and many of the others, then you'd better be ready to go and play, and I think that has helped our guys become very, very competitive. 
We've seen twice in the last, what, six or seven months a young‑‑ a mid‑aged English golfer called David Lynn that I would think in this room other than Colin and I very few of you never would have heard of because he never played in the United States.   He came in, as we know, around second in Kiawah, and he's tied and lost a playoff just over 24 hours ago.   Colin maybe would be a better judge than me, but there's probably 100 David Lynns playing on the European Tour today. 
And I think the other question was of the Ryder Cup.   I hope we've already given a feel for how we would both answer this, Colin from in the crucible.   The lady asked a beautiful question about Colin's success in the singles.   I think he was pretty modest with his answer as to why he remained unbeaten.   I think firstly if you look at his foursome and four‑ball record, that's pretty darned good, as well.   I think that gives you a good clue as to why he maybe played in eight singles and didn't lose.   He didn't lose too many of the others. 
The Ryder Cup is really European golf's second major.   When I started at the Tour and the American golfers‑‑ the great American golfers at that time led by Arnold, Jack, Lee Trevino, Tom Watson was arriving, Johnny Miller, we can go on, Billy Casper, Gene Littler, all of them, the only time we would see them in Europe was at the Open Golf Championship, from 1960 when Arnold came, very quickly brought Jack, and for the 53 years since, all of the best American and international golfers have followed.   We owe that to Arnold Palmer.   He rejuvenated the third century of The Open, the third 50 if you like. 
At that time you would only then see them once every other four years in the Ryder Cup, and until '85 we'd had such a barren run that we were not competitive until we expanded the team.   We could say from then on the rest is history.   The Ryder Cup has been a magnificent competition since Jack kissed Lanny Wadkins divot at Palm Beach in '1983, and I think that's how we see it. 

Q.   With respect to your record missing a major, there are a number of players who have won a major, who have won two majors that people would consider haven't had a great career.   How do you strike a balance of that over the course of a career? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It's a four‑day tournament, a major championship, and I've enjoyed thoroughly my exploits in major championships.   I just haven't been fortunate or whatever it takes, I've never, ever stood up and made a winner's speech and said I was unlucky.   Never.   I never will.   There's always a time where a bit of fortune comes your way, whether it be for you or against your opponent at the time, and it just so happens with five runner‑ups and two thirds that I just haven't been so‑called fortunate to walk through the door.   The door has been ajar many a time, I just haven't been able to walk through it. 
So at the same time, if you're talking about regrets of any part of my golfing career, I have none.   Absolutely none.   I've done exactly what I've tried to do.   I've tried 100 percent on every shot, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.   We all know ourselves as golfers, my word, sometimes it's not the easiest game, and we all understand that.   So it's just so happens that I haven't managed to win one.   I look forward to the Seniors Tour and trying to win them there.   Gary Player counts them as majors, doesn't he? 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   Gary also counts ties, Colin, so Gary's answer to Doug would be I already have a couple. 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I've got a couple at least, yeah.   I've got a couple. 
I noticed in Freddie Couples' exhibit, for example, that he proudly displays the replica of the British Senior Open that he won last year at Turnberry, and it's interesting how that was included because that's Freddie's success outside America and into the European, the British Senior, and he's very proud of that R&A award that he has, and it's amazing that it's put there in a very prominent position in his exhibit, and I noticed that with interest. 
I'm looking forward to the rest of one's career.   It's great this has happened, this Hall of Fame induction, when one is still in his 40s, just.   I've got a month to go.   And I look forward to trying to capture a major, whether it be senior one or otherwise, in the future. 

Q.   Of the close calls you've had, which was at least two playoffs, was it not? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It was two playoffs.

Q.   Which one took the longest to get over or hurt the most or however you want to look at it?   And secondly, do you have any fun recollections of when Jack awarded you the '92 Open? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   That means I've got three because he gave me that, as well.   I finished my round in 1992 at Pebble Beach and it was blowing a gale, and to be honest, whether it was fortunate or not, I played a round of my life and managed to get in in 70, and of course everyone was coming in 78, 79.   I and a lot of others felt I was going to win.   It wasn't just Jack and I, it was everyone else who thought the same. 
And knowing the course as Jack did, of course a past winner at Pebble Beach in U.S. Opens that I truly did believe it, and he congratulated me on being our national champion, being in America, and I said that's very kind of you, thank you very much.   I said, well, that's very kind of you; where's the trophy?   I haven't seen it yet.
It's amazing in golf that it's not over until it's over, and it's the classic case, and Tom Kite and Jeff Sluman, not forgetting Jeff Sluman, played extremely well coming in and managed to come in one and two shots ahead of me.
But the one that does get away, forget the playoffs, is the 2006 Winged Foot.   I know Phil Mickelson, a fellow inductee now, can say the same.   He double bogeyed the last hole, and so did I just minutes before him, and we threw that one away.   That's the one that hurts.   The four others or five others really, somebody happened to beat me.   The 2006 Winged Foot I beat myself, and that's where it hurts most.   So that has taken the most to recover from. 
I'm so glad I managed to win on Tour after that in Ireland, and that took the pressure away from that because I would have hated to have that as my legacy, having a 4 to win from the middle of the fairway.   That was poor for me or any golfer. 
That would be the one shot‑‑ if I had one shot again, that would be it.   But that's the one that's taken the longest to get over, if there has been.   But I've managed to put them behind, and with good performances, you shake Steve Elkington's hand for birdieing the first extra hole; you shake Els and Loren Roberts; you shake Els again‑‑ I'm fed up with shaking Els's hand, and you just get on with it and you move on.   You've got to.   What else can you do? 
You look forward.   You never look back.   You always have to look forward, and that's what I'm doing from now on.

Q.   I would think you didn't beat yourself very often. 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I didn't.   That's why it hurt.   I didn't beat myself very often at all.   I finished off‑‑ I could finish, yeah.   I just didn't on that occasion.   Hey, you know, we're still here.   Come on. 

Q.   Now that you're both in, is there somebody that you feel also is deserving of the honor and may champion in the future and vote for? 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   Well, if I could go from outside the ropes, it would be a Spanish lady called Emma Ballesteros, who may be unknown to most of us here today, but we call her Europe's First Lady of Golf.   Unquestionably in Europe, I would surmise most of the world, she'd be the one single person to who has done more to see golf readmitted to the Olympic Games.   She was also with Seve and the late Jimmy PatiÃ±o around Valderrama Golf Club.   She did a tremendous amount to get Ryder Cup '97 to Spain. 
She was also a very fine lady amateur golfer in Spain, captained the Spanish national team, and it's a lifelong devotee of John Jacobs, who happens to be my mentor. 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I would think about‑‑ Ken is obviously more outside the ropes as I am more inside them, and three names ring to mind, I suppose.   Ian Woosnam, you talk about five golfers in Europe that we talk about, Ian Woosnam could be nominated and hopefully will shortly be inducted into the Hall of Fame, and also you've got two here that I've got great respect for, and that's Davis Love and Mark O'Meara that have been great ambassadors for the game here in the States and worldwide and are very well thought of and have traveled, as you say, Ken, over to the Open Championship on many, many occasions and played the game the right way, both of them. 
So yes, in the near future I would expect those three names to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. 

Q.   You may talk about this tonight, but tell me a little bit about your start in golf and at that moment you realized this is what you wanted to do for your career. 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I'll tell you when it was when I realized, when I got my degree from university in Houston.   I was at Houston Baptist University for four years, '84 to '87, and May '87 I graduated and then I had the insurance policy to play golf, therefore it didn't really matter if the putts weren't in because I had something else to fall back on, and therefore they did. 
So that's the time that I realized I could do this was when I got my degree from university, yeah, and not before. 

Q.   And that degree was in? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   It was in business management and law degree.   You had to have a major and a minor in those days.   I don't know if it's still done, but more business management than law because law was difficult. 

Q.   When you're on the conveyor belt of the seven Order of Merits, was there ever a time you were tempted to come over and spend one full season on the U.S. Tour, and if you were tempted, what kept you? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   I was tempted very often.   I was asked numerous occasions by Deane Beman to start with and also by Tim Finchem to come over here and play full‑time in the States, whether it be one season or more, and family commitments kept me in Europe.   I was very happy and comfortable at home, and my wife and children were now in school, and I was very comfortable and happy at home. 
So there was no‑‑ I felt there was no need at that stage to come over here.   I was No.1 in Europe.   I was very happy in Europe and I was comfortable in that position, and therefore I stayed there.   If it's not bust, you don't fix it, and that was why I really didn't come over here, yeah. 
But I look forward now in many ways to starting a new life, a new chapter of my life to come over here now, where the children have grown up and there's no‑‑ my wife and I are looking so much forward to coming over here and playing the Champions Tour.   I turn 50 next month, and I so much look forward to it. 

Q.   Fred Couples is among the people you'll share a stage with tonight.   Can you just talk about memorable times that you've crossed paths with Fred? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Yeah, I've crossed paths with Fred many times.   I must have played golf in major championships and major events 50‑odd times in my career, and we kept on getting partnered together, and even the Ryder Cups together with his good friend and partner Davis Love.   I remember one particular game at Valderrama where I fathered around Darren Clarke.   It was his very first Ryder Cup experience, his very first game, and I was partnering him against Davis Love and Freddie Couples, and it was, wow, hang on, they've just won the World Cup for the fourth time in a row, an unprecedented fourth time in a row, and how are we going to beat this pair, and we managed it just one hole, and great matches. 
Freddie was always somebody that pulled something special out of the hat.   You could never think that you were safe playing against someone with the talent of Freddie Couples.   Freddie Couples has never really been taught how to play golf; Freddie Couples played golf falling out of the cradle, and it's obvious the way Freddie plays and the relaxed way that he is.   But believe me, under that relaxed image is a very tough competitor and a very, very good one. 
Again, a great ambassador here in the States for your game. 

Q.   Why does everybody like Fred so much? 
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Yeah, I don't know.   You know, every woman wants to be with Fred and every man wants to be Fred, and it's like, God, this is fantastic, he's covered both sexes.   I don't understand why everybody loves Fred, don't they?   He's the young Arnold Palmer here, and he's loved.   Phil Mickelson is loved, as well, and so is Fred Couples, and it's super to be on the stage with him this evening. 

Q.   Ken, outside the ropes which Hall of Fame member inspires you the most and why? 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   Outside?   Well, there are many.   If I, for example, could‑‑ there are a number of guys who you could now say are in the hall on both fronts, one is being inducted tonight in his sad absence because of illness, and Ken Venturi is not well as we speak, and I know that he can be in the hall with Freddie and with Colin and many others for his championship and his Tour career inside the ropes, but I think if you've done 35 years in the booth at CBS Sports, and coming as I've been privileged to do with my wife who's here and our daughters to the United States since 1975 and very quickly at or just after that time, the voice of golf here was for many, many, many years Ken Venturi. 
I've been very influenced, and I hope along with Colin and Freddie, by the way, who as you would have seen earlier is as nervous tonight as he's ever been, and we suddenly discovered this last night when we finished the forum, and I saw the look on Fred's face as we were being kind of told by the guys what was expected as today we get ever closer to 6:00.   Freddie looked at Colin and said, "geez, I haven't even got a word thought.   I've got to ring Jimmy, who must help me and quick." 
Well, about two hours ago Jimmy did not help Fred, and he killed off myself and Colin because he spoke at the family luncheon in the hall as only a man of that quality and that status could do, and you talk about Seve being passionate as we both did about the Ryder Cup and about golf, the little pep talk that Jimmy gave us left several lateral and yellow line water hazards in that room.   You might note we have not quite recovered.
So he spoke seriously about the hall and he spoke not only about Freddie but about Ken Venturi, and as someone who started as a volunteer in one of the Shell Wonderful World of Golf matches between the 1961 United States Open champion Gene Littler and Scotland's then own Eric Brown, I've been influenced by American golf and golf in America ever since. 
Ken Venturi would be up there, and of course I would put John Jacobs, who again is in the hall but could have been in as a champion golfer as a British and Irish Ryder Cup player in his own right, but I think John would say he's in the hall because of his teaching and because he founded the modern European Tour, and to have visited with him two weeks ago along with George O'Grady, John is now 88 years young in mind, not in body.   He's been very special for not just myself but for all of European golf. 

Q.   Colin, for you, maybe not one of your contemporaries‑‑
COLIN MONTGOMERIE:   Yeah, it was interesting, there's a wall of brass of one's head shots, and it's in alphabetical order, so I'm on the same wall right now.   It changes every year because it's alphabetical.   They do a great job to have to move us all around, but at least I'm being moved around; at least I'm on there.   I'm below Johnny Miller and above Mark McCormick. 
Now, Mark McCormick to me, being under his wing and having started with him 23 years ago and still to this day I'm a client and I feel of his still, and I think what he did in the world of golf, to see the possibility of being an agent for someone to sell Arnold Palmer, and I think that was the start of the modern game of golf was Mark McCormick and Arnold Palmer, and of course they were great friends and remained so through life. 
And I think that the one person that means a lot to me on that wall personally and professionally is Mark McCormick, and one that is as deserving as anyone to be there. 
KEN SCHOFIELD:   If I could support that, also, by saying that sadly, for myself, the last time I saw Mark alive was here, in November 2002, when he came to do the citation for Bernhard Langer's induction on the evening I was carded to speak on behalf of Tony Jacklin.
The sadness felt all around the world of golf when Mark fell fatally ill within a couple of short months is something that we've got on from because as Colin says you go on, but he was a huge figure.   John Jacobs gave me a number of thoughts for my first day in office, and one of them was to meet early with Mark, and he said that Mark will be very demanding and domineering, he'll want to strike the best deal for his clients, but he also said, if you shake Mark's hand and he shakes yours, he'll never break a deal.   He never did. 
TRAVIS HILL:   Everyone, thank you so much for attending today's press conferences.   We'll see you tonight.
