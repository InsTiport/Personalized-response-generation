 Q.  So it was a difficult match there.  How are you feeling after that match?  
ALICE HEWSON: We played really well out there.  Like both myself and Lily, we played really, really well.  They just holed the absolute world, so I think we've got to take some confidence in how we were actually playing, not worry about the score too much, and just go out there and keep playing our good golf this afternoon.   
 Q.  The conditions are a lot harder today.  Does that make a difference, or are you just focused on the match ahead?  
ALICE HEWSON: It wasn't too much of a difference.  You've just got to spend the extra little bit of time kind of hydrating, keeping yourself cool, making a bit of an effort to stand in the shade rather than the sun because these are long days out there.   
 Q.  When the opponents hole putts like that, you just have to stand back and watch it, and there's not much you can do?  
ALICE HEWSON: No, there is not much you can do.  You've just got to stand there, clap, and accept that they've hit a really good putt.
