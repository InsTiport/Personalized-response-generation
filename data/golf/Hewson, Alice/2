 Q.  Alice, this is a little bit of a familiar area for you?  
ALICE HEWSON: Yeah, I actually drove down yesterday morning.  It wasn't too bad of a drive.  I seemed to have come through every farm in South Carolina to get here.  Yeah, it was nice and easy to get here, which was good.   
 Q.  As I'm talking to a lot of players and coaches leading up to this week, everybody is talking about the Clemson tournament, and I heard this thing last night that it got moved maybe because of you.  Tell me about this.  
ALICE HEWSON: Well, it wasn't just because of me but because of the tournament in general.  We have a really good field at the Clemson Invitational, so the coaches knew that more than just me would be making the tournament, and you know, we might not get as good of a field if people were going to be leaving their best players at home.   
So yeah, I'll be driving back Saturday night, ready to tee off for the first round Sunday morning.
