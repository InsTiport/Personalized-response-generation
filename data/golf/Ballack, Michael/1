 Q.  You've won many trophies as a footballer and now you've won playing golf.  Try to sort out your emotions.  
MICHAEL BALLACK: Tremendous.  I was a little bit emotional yesterday, because you know what it means, to tee off in the last group here at St. Andrews.  I really like golf, but today I knew what it means and to win it, unbelievable.  I have to say thanks to Florian, he helped me a lot and especially when I had to pick up the ball a few times.  He saved me.  So we worked well as a team and that's how it should be.   
 Q.  It's your first experience of a championship like this, you said you've never played this format before.  Tell us how you've enjoyed it.  
FLORIAN FRITSCH: It's been fantastic.  I've never played anything like this, especially on The European Tour.  I get to play somebody I've been walking pretty much all my life on telly and I get to play with him on my turf in golf.  So we almost have -- I don't know if it really was that way, but I'm going to imagine that it was that way; that he might have maybe looked up to me on the golf course.   
So now that we are done with this tournament and we have both within together, as soon as you play football again, I can look up to you again.   
 Q.  What about the last couple holes, you needed to finish birdie, birdie to get this thing done?  
MICHAEL BALLACK: It looked a long time, it looked really good.  I thought we were leading comfortable but suddenly another team was leading and we had a bogey and double-bogey.  So we had to do two in the last three, but it worked.  Somehow it worked and it was a great experience.  As an amateur, you just enjoy the moment here.  It's not about winning at all, but it's just to be part of such a great tournament.  It was really special.
