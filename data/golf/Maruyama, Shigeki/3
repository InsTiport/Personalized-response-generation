  Q. You seem very comfortable on this golf course, and it's reflected in your play: One shot out of the lead heading into the final round.   
 SHIGEKI MARUYAMA: How about that, one stroke back, and you can make that up in one hole, two holes, easily. But I'm not thinking about a real low score tomorrow. I'm just going to do my best, play one hole at a time.   
  
  Q. The gallery certainly seems on your side. You had so many fans following you around the golf course again today.   
 SHIGEKI MARUYAMA: There are a lot of Japanese tourists here. Boy, you walk downtown, it's like Japan. So it's like my second home here.  
  
  Q. I admire your demeanor; you're always smiling out there.   
 SHIGEKI MARUYAMA: I'm going to do my best to show an even bigger smile tomorrow.
