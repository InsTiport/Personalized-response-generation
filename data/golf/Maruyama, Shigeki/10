JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  We thank Shigeaki for joining us for a few minutes here in the media center.

15 under par.  Finished up with a good birdie on 18.  Talk about the day and your position going into the final day.
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  I'm hitting the ball very solid today, this week, especially from the tee box.  I try to put the ball in a safe place for the second shot.  If I can hit with the short irons, I was aggressive to the pins.

I had two eagles today, both 3 woods.  Both perfect.  I made very good putts.  That brought me the great score today.

JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Questions.
Q.  Anything about this course that you seem to warm up to, any particular characteristic of it?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  The golf course is very good conditions.  The greens are very slow first two days compared to the last years, few years ago when I won the tournament.  I thought it was going to be very low scores to win the tournament.

Of course, it's getting better.  Making good putts.  It's very good.
Q.  How aggressive do you have to be tomorrow to win?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  Every day, someone making a very big score.  I made two eagles today.  Played great golf.  You don't know who it's going to happen tomorrow, someone making very big score.  I still have to make a lot of birdies and try to make over 20s for tomorrow to win the tournament.
