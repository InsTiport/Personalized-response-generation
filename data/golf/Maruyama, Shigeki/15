CHRIS REIMER:  Good to welcome our defending champion back to the Chrysler Classic of Greensboro.  Shigeki, would you like to talk a little bit about what it's like to be back here as the champion?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  I'm really proud to come back here as a defending champion.  And everybody is expecting, everybody is saying, everybody says to me like defend the title, repeat, and so hopefully, of course I want to and hopefully I can show my best game this week.
CHRIS REIMER:  Questions?
Q.  Is the course a lot more difficult?  Some guys are talking about the rough being a little thicker this year.  Is the course more difficult than it was last year?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  The course is definitely getting difficult, more difficult than last year.  The rough is longer and it's just sits just one more ball down in the rough and it's really hard to hit the ball properly.  But the greens they're softer than last year.

Everybody can stop the balls on the greens.  It depends on the situation.  If you hit it in the rough the ball sits on the grass better.  If you don't have a good, if you don't have the lie, the ball will sit inside that rough.  So it all depend on the lie, the luck.  The course is getting more difficult.
Q.  You were talking about defending here, what would it mean to defend, given Sam Snead's the only guy who ever defended here and it's been 50 some odd years since anyone did it?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  It's going to be a really good thing, it gives you more confidence, but it's really hard to defend a title in this field.

Of course I want to do that.  But the last couple weeks I've been having a really busy schedule.  I went to Ireland, back to L.A., went to Hawaii, last week I came over here.  So I still don't know which time I'm living on.  I'm just trying to hit the ball as good as I can and show my best golf.
Q.  What were you doing in Hawaii?  Vacation, I guess?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  Vacation.
Q.  How many days did you spend over there?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  Five days.
Q.  So you went Ireland?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  Ireland.
Q.  You stopped in L.A.?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  Yes, stopped in L.A.
Q.  Five days in L.A.?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  Ireland, L.A., Hawaii, L.A., North Carolina
Q.  I assume you're flying in your own jet so you're not getting the frequent flier miles out of that?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  We charter a jet.
Q.  Any idea how many miles you flew, though?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  Maybe just around the world.  The earth.  Probably.
Q.  Do you know that Sam Snead's kind of synonymous with this place?

He won it eight times and he was the last guy to defend and so what would that mean to join Sam as the only guy whose ever repeated?
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  It's very really -- I'm going to be really happy if my name is going to be next to Sam Snead's name.

I'm always happy when my name is on the board somewhere on the golf course.
CHRIS REIMER:  Okay, thank you Shigeki.
SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  Thank you.
