SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:  I only missed the fairway once, at the 18th.  Except for that I had perfect golf  -- I had a couple more birdie chances, but unfortunately I couldn't get one.  I hit -- I had really good shots and really good putting.  I'm very happy with my game today. 

Q.  I notice last week you withdrew from Westchester.  Were you hurt or some reason you didn't finish there? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   I had  -- a problem with the neck and shoulder.  Last week after I finished the first round, the day before it suspended  -- finished rest of the holes of the first round on Friday, went back to the hotel for a little bit of sleep and injured my neck when I woke up.  It wasn't a big problem, but I just  -- it was just very hard to swing. 

Q.  Did you take a few days off and not swing? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   I didn't grab any golf clubs.  I had the weekend off.  Went to New York, sight-seeing. 

Q.  Until Monday? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   Tuesday.  A little bit of practice. 

Q.  What was the best part of your game today? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   The first hole, the beginning hole when I had a birdie.  Hit the ball to 30 feet and that helped me get on a wave today.  That was a big putt. 

Q.  When was the last time you had a 63 in the first round?  Can you remember?  Has it been a while? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   The first time, I think, in the first round.

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   Yeah!!!  (Smiling).

Q.  What were your expectations coming in after not playing?  Yesterday in the Pro-Am you were like 4-over or something.  What were your expectations today? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   I had 4-over on the front nine yesterday, couldn't hit it very well.  But I fixed my swing on the back nine and was very comfortable table.  I didn't have any pressure the last four days  -- for the next four days and I was very looking forward to playing here, because I had a good shot on the back nine getting better. 

Q.  Were there any holes out here where you had to save par? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   No. 7.  No. 11.  15, chipped in.  No.  18. 

Q.  Can you go over the birdie putts, what you hit into the greens and length of putts for the birdies? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   I'm not very confident putting at the moment, but I just saw the line, first impression, hit the ball where I aimed and had success, very well.   No.  1, tee shot, driver fairway.  Second shot 52-degree wedge, about 30 feet.  No. 3, tee shot, driver fairway.  Second shot 52-degree wedge.  Little over the back fringe.  Chip-in, using a putter, about 18 feet.  No.  6, tee shot, driver, fairway.  Second, shot 3-wood.  Side fringe, putted to about a foot.  No. 8, 5-iron about six feet.  No. 12, tee shot, driver.  Second shot, 52-degree wedge, about ten feet.  No. 13, tee shot, driver, fairway.  Second shot, 5-wood over the fringe to 2-putt.  No. 15, tee shot, 3-wood.  Second shot sand wedge a little over.  Sand wedge, chip-in, about 18 feet. 

Q.  Do you have as much fun playing this game as it looks? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   I may seem to be -- actually enjoying to play, but I'm actually nervous. 

Q.  When you're nervous, you smile? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   Oh, always smiling. 

Q.  For the first day of a PGA TOUR event, have you ever been this far up on the leaderboard before? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   This is the first time I ever have on the PGA Tour. 

Q.  How well up have you been on the first day before? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   Third before  -- several times finished in the Top-10 on the first day.  But this is the best. 

Q.  The best was third; where was that? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   I don't remember where it was. 

Q.  Have you ever played a round on the Tour without a bogey? 

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   Yes.
