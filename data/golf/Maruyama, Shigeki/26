CHRIS REIMER:  Shigeki Maruyama, posting a 7-under 65.  How good is it to get off to a good start today?

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   At the beginning of the day everybody knows Davis hits very fast and I was trying to catch up.  After a couple of holes, I started relaxing and started making good putts and a couple of birdies.


Q.   Two of the last three events you finished in the Top-10.  Do you feel you're playing really hot right now?

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   I injured my neck this year and was struggling with my golf, the putting, and just getting it better.  My neck was just getting better the last three or four weeks and then I was having good golf and my putting was becoming stable.


Q.   What was wrong with your neck?

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   Between the fifth or sixth in the bones it was really dry and some nerves, pinched nerves.  I went to see lots of doctors.


Q.   What did you think about the greens overall?

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   The greens have undulations.  It's very hard to aim for the pins.  You can aim at the pins with short irons.  When I hit long irons, I try to put the ball in a safe place.  If you miss the safe place, it can be very dangerous.  Today they were very good.


Q.   It has been a couple of years since your last victory, 2001.  Why haven't you been able to break through since?

SHIGEKI MARUYAMA:   My neck.

CHRIS REIMER:  Let's go through your birdies and bogeys.

No. 6, driver, 6-iron to about 15 feet.

No. 7, 5-iron left side rough, pitching wedge, six feet.

No. 9, driver, 3-iron lay-up, sand wedge, 24 feet.
