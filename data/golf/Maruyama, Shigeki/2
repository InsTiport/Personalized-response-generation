 Q. Great round today, 5-under 65, right out of the gate. Just a few comments on the key to the round. 
 SHIGEKI MARUYAMA: The key to my round today, I really hit my driver well, really put it in the fairway all day long, and I was hitting really good putts. What helped me with my driver is once I got it in the fairway, we were playing lift, clean and place and I was able to really get a good lie and go after the pins, so that was really the key.

 Q. What is it you like about Waialae so much that suits your game so well? 
 SHIGEKI MARUYAMA: I love playing here. I love Waialae. It's not a long course like we find out on the TOUR most weeks. The rough isn't real deep, and there's not a lot of lakes and hazards, and so I can really enjoy playing here. It really suits my game.

 Q. And last question, you're obviously a fan favorite here this week. Are you aware of the larger than normal gallery that follows you? 
 SHIGEKI MARUYAMA: Sure I notice, and I'm grateful for the fans that come out and cheer for me. This is the No. 1 TOUR spot for Japanese to come here in Hawai'i, and it helps me to have a lot of gallery fans pulling for me.
