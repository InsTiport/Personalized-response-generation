  Q.  You didn't come close to making a bogey today until the 18th hole.   
 MATHEW GOGGIN:  Yeah, reminded me yeah, my chance for a bogey was on 9 off the front edge, when I hit a pretty suspect chip about 10 feet and made the putt.   
 But apart from that, I was putting for birdie pretty much every hole.  So I played really nicely today.   
  
  Q.  On the number 12 tee you had a three putt, I know it was from 80 feet, but you had it 7 feet for birdie?   
 MATHEW GOGGIN:  Less than 7, it was about two, two and a half.  So two par 5s on the back side didn't really do me any good.  So I played well.   
 That's only the first round, and I'm in good position.  So, you know, I can get back into it tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Take me through 18 one more time, being jammed up.   
 MATHEW GOGGIN:  Yeah, I just drove it.  I went for it too much off the tee.  Drove it, caught it in the left rough, ten yards short.  And drew a nice enough lie to sort of get forward, and just sort of drew a tough side of the lie.  You know, 40 yards from the front of the green.  Didn't come out so fast.  And had a pretty easy chip in.  I was only a yard off the front of the green, chipping straight off the green.  Wasn't a tough shot.  Just overhit it, and missed the six footer coming back.   
  
  Q.  Well, Matthew, good solid opening round.  Good luck the rest of the week.   
 MATHEW GOGGIN:  Thanks very much.
