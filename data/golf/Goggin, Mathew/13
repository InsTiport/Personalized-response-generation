 Q. Bogey-free for the entire weekend. 
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Yeah, I hit the ball really well, probably the best on Thursday and struggled a bit with the putter the first three days to be honest. Today I made a couple of par putts which I have not been making, a couple 5- to 10-footers. Pretty solid. Hit a lot of greens and hit a lot of fairways. I missed it in the right spot, so I was really happy. 

 Q. Do you like this new system with the volatility?
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Yeah, obviously it does reward guys that play well. 
 There might be a bit of a change after it's all said and done, because I guess there's a possibility you'll get guys finishing in the Top-70 of the FedExCup points and probably not finish in the Top-125 of the Money List so won't get into the Memorial and other tournaments next year, which is kind of bizarre. 
 If it it's going to be a Playoffs, I think it's a lot more fun to have the volatility, but maybe the big swings early on, maybe make it not quite so severe it might be more pleasing to everybody, but I'm pretty happy with it so far.

 Q. What do you do now? 
 MATHEW GOGGIN: I was going to go pick up my rental car actually, I don't know if I have enough time. See how the traffic goes. I don't know, we'll see what happens.
