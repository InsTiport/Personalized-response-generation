  Q. Start with a bogey, end with a bogey, but in between, hello there.   
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Yeah, you tend to concentrate on the bogeys when you're down, don't you? Yeah, I played really well. I played well yesterday, had 34 putts, shot 1-under, which is pretty ordinary really, but I kept playing well again today but made the putts I didn't make yesterday. Nine birdies is a lot.  
  
  Q. What was that difference? When that ball started going in the hole, did you think to yourself, okay, now I've got the feel?  
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Yeah, I did a little bit of technique work at the start of the week, which can always be a double-edged sword. You get out on the first green, you're more concentrating on whether the stroke looks pretty rather than when it rolls in the hole. So today I sort of said, oh, stuff it, I'm just going to keep my timing and get a good feel. I made a nice putt for bogey on the 1st. I was a bit sleepy out of the gate, but that gave me a bit of confidence with the putter, so that was good.  
  
  Q. Sometimes people say you need to make a bogey to get yourself kick-started a little bit.   
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Not really; I'd just as soon not have any. I'd feel more kick-started if I didn't make any and I started with a bunch of birdies, I think.  
  
  Q. I don't know whether to say sorry or you're welcome about 17, and I didn't think you could hear me. You backed off at 17. But then the putt went in the hole?  
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Yeah, it went in top side. It would have gone in the middle if you didn't stuff it up behind the green. You know a clipboard is not a cone of silence. You can actually hear around it.  
  
  Q. I was standing next to a generator. I couldn't believe you could hear me.   
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Apology accepted.
