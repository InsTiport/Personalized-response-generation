 Q. A 67 for you today, you post 6-under par, the big blow was on the 11th hole, I believe a 5-iron that helped you make eagle on that hole. Just talk about your round, first of all. 
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Yeah, played really well. I think I only missed two greens, one fairway, and one of the greens I missed was on 17 was from about 12, 13 feet. 
 I hit the ball really well and gave myself a lot of opportunities. I didn't really convert that many. It was a nice round in tough conditions, but it would have been nice to have a few more putts drop.

 Q. We picked you up on our coverage on the 17th, on 17 you had an opportunity to get to 7. 
 MATHEW GOGGIN: Yeah, we grinded it a little bit on the right and I hit it just on the right lip. Hit a good putt, and the wind was a little bit stronger on the last and came up a bit short. Disappointing not to have a putt to finish at 7. You don't know what is going to happen in the last few holes. There could be a few train wrecks, or the guys could cruise in. To get to go 7 would be nice.

 Q. What will you do now? 
 MATHEW GOGGIN: I'm pack up my gear, get my car ready, and unless someone finishes at 7, I'll be on my way down the I-4.
