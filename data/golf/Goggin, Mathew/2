 Q.   When you first saw this Merion course did you think, yeah, I like this?  
MATHEW GOGGIN:   Well, it was so soft when I came out here Monday and it was still wet last week.   It was just so long.   You knew the long holes were going to play tough.   And the USGA can put those pins in some terrific spots and defend the short holes and you also have to hit 3‑woods into par‑3s.   So that's a lot of golf course.   
   
 Q.   You're going to play 30 holes today.   What's the biggest challenge of that?  
MATHEW GOGGIN:   It's just, obviously, might get a little bit tired, make a few tired swings.   
But if you're playing well it's probably a bit of an advantage, because you get to keep rolling, get a bit of momentum going.   You don't have to go sleep on a good round or anything like that.   You get right back out on the course.
