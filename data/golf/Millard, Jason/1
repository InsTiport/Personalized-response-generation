Q. Good round today, if you could, just kind of talk about what was going right out there for you.
JASON MILLARD: Off the tee I was really not hitting it well, to be honest, I just kind of scored well.  Here lately it's been the opposite, I hit the bell well, but I haven't scored very good.  Now probably my fairway percentage is no more than 40 percent.  It hasn't been very good.  The fairway bunker shots and saving pars, my short game was pretty good.  I putted well.  I didn't make that many bogeys, which is the main thing for me.
Q. Is there any one part of your game in particular that was working the best for you out there these last couple days?
JASON MILLARD: Probably say my iron game and putting.  Definitely not the driving.  I'm going to have to throw that out if I want to keep going.
Q. What's your approach for the Finals at this point where you stand now and knowing what is at stake that you can get done this weekend?
JASON MILLARD: You try not to even think about that, but it's always in the back of your mind.  Just going to try to approach every shot the same, it's just golf at the end of the day.  Just try to stay in the process and shot by shot.
Q. What do you think about the course?
JASON MILLARD: It's a great golf course.  I played it in college at Ohio State's tournament, so I didn't, it was like seven years ago, so I didn't really remember it that well, but I remembered some holes.  It's a great golf course, it's tough, I don't see scores being that low, like last week at Boise, it won't be 20 something under.  I don't see that.  It's a great golf course.
Q. Being at Ohio State, Jack Nicklaus obviously is a legend here.  What's one thing you would like to ask Jack Nicklaus?
JASON MILLARD: What made him successful.  I'm sure there's a lot that goes into that, but that would be the first thing that I would ask him.
