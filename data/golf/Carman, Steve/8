  Q. Went out and looked at the golf course when the rain had stopped, and decided we could not play today. Have to come back out at 7:30 a.m. local time. What was a major part of that decision?  
 STEVE CARMAN: This golf course has got a lot of bunkers, a lot of long bunkers and a lot of the edges have fallen down, so maintenance crew is going to have to pull up all those edges. Wouldn't be fair for somebody's ball to get embedded or down into one of those eroded areas from all the rain. We had two and a half inches of rain in three hours. It came down very heavy for a short period of time.   
 So was it going to take them over an hour, hour and a half to get that ready. By the time the thunder and lightning storms left, there just wasn't enough daylight for playing golf.  
  
  Q. What does this mean for Saturday?   
 STEVE CARMAN: We're going to try to get them back in position for 7:30. The forecast for tomorrow isn't very good. We'll get them out here tomorrow morning and we can play, we'll do that. We've got about six hours of golf to finish the second round. The front's supposed to be here sometime midafternoon and after that it's supposed to clear up.   
 So we're thinking we're going to have a few hours late tomorrow afternoon. If we can get a couple of hours of golf in prior to that we'll finish the round by sunset tomorrow. We've still got a couple of options to get 72 holes in by the end of the day.
