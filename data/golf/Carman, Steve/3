Q. Obviously no play possible since the call off.  What can you tell us about the latest situation, is there any chance to play today?
STEVE CARMAN: There's a slight chance to play.  We got to get the thunder and lightning threat out of here.  We have gone through the last of the heavy rain.  So we got to take a look at the golf course to see how well it took the rain.  But there's a chance.
Q. Would you say then, is there any particular time that you're thinking about possibly getting them back out?
STEVE CARMAN: Yeah, I got basically two goals:  We need to play about two hours of golf today to be able to finish 72 holes by the end of the day Sunday.  So that means we would have to get started by 5:30 to finish with dark at 7:30.
The next goal would be to try to get everybody teed off.  Which is about an hour worth of tee times left.  So that means we would have to start by 6:30.  If we can't reach those two goals, then we'll probably send them home.
Q. What about the forecast for tomorrow?  How is that looking at the moment?
STEVE CARMAN: The front that's sitting on top of us is projected to stay on top of us most of the day tomorrow, so we're going to have periods of rain and then periods of non-rain.  So we're hoping that without thunder and lightning, we'll be able to play during the period of rain and be able to play all day.
Q. At what point would you call it a 54-hole tournament?  When is that decision made?
STEVE CARMAN: If we can't get 72 holes in by the end of the day Monday, then it would revert back to 54 holes.
Q. But you would consider starting the final round on Monday or just completing a round on Monday?
STEVE CARMAN: We would start the final round on Monday.  Last year at Sanderson Farms in Jackson, Mississippi we actually started the fourth round on Monday, finished about five o'clock in the evening.
