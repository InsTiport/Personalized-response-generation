 Q.  Well, good run at it.  
JEFF WILSON: Yeah. You know unfortunately I think Brady took it out of me earlier today and I really didn't play very well today.   
Like I said, I was just hanging in there with everything I had, but it wasn't very good.   
 Q.  Good par putt there on the previous hole after all that delay.  
JEFF WILSON: Yeah, no, I made about a 6- or 8-footer right there. Birdied 1.   
But my shot quality was not very good today. Like I said, I was doing whatever I could to hang in the match. I was actually pretty fortunate to extend it as long as I did.   
 Q.  And then what happened here on this approach?  
JEFF WILSON: Well, we talked about -- I don't know how much rain came down, inch in 20 minutes. I get very close to the green with my drive and we talked about laying it back because of how wet the ground was.   
Just said to heck with it. Let's just keep doing what we're doing. Then I got up there and I was on a downhill lie and the ground is wet, and it was just a hard shot.   
Really everything was fine except I just missed the putt. That's what it boiled down to.   
 Q.  About a 4-footer...  
JEFF WILSON: Yeah, it was probably four feet downhill and left to right. It's putt I probably should have made, but I didn't.   
 Q.  Overall this week. I mean, you didn't probably have your A Game...  
JEFF WILSON: No, I really didn't. I was struggling with my swing the whole week. Yesterday I kind of had -- I made some progress. I played pretty well this morning.   
This afternoon just didn't play very well.
