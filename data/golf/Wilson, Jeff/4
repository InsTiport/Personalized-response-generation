 Q.  Talk about the start of the match?  
JEFF WILSON: Yeah, I mean, I was fortunate today.  Josh didn't play his best and I was able to hang in there, and I played really well the last four holes.   
You know, I mean, I was lucky to be where I was, you know, even -- lucky I had the match even going into the last four.   
 Q.  And you had big birdies on 15 and 17 to kind of finish it off.  
JEFF WILSON: Yeah, I hit it in the hazard on --what hole was that?  I guess it's 14.  Just hit a terrible shot in the hazard.   
You know, I had kind of hit a hook wedge, and I kind of -- I felt a little something that kind of helped me with my swing, and the last coming in I hit really good shots.   
Felt good to be in the position where I could do it.  It wasn't very pretty out there.   
 Q.  And then coming into this week, do you feel more pressure now as a USGA champion or less?  
JEFF WILSON: I would say no different.  I always enjoy coming to these things and I try to play hard.  I don't think anything has changed.  I feel pretty good about it, but...   
 Q.  How do you feel your game is right now compared to a couple weeks ago at the Senior Am?  
JEFF WILSON: Not quite -- it's not quite there.  I've struggled a little bit, but I'm still hanging in there.   
 Q.  Any changes you'll make heading into the round of 32 tomorrow?  
JEFF WILSON: No.  I've been practicing pretty hard, and I think I'm going to not hit anymore balls today.  I'm going to hang them up and come out fresh tomorrow.   
 Q.  How did the course play today?  
JEFF WILSON: I think it's a hard golf course.  I really do.  A lot of guys are shooting really good scores out here, but I think it's a very difficult course.
