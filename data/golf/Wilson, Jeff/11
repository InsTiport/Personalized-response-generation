 Q.  Good job, sir.  JEFF WILSON: Thanks.   Q.  Maintained your lead in the low amateur sweepstakes.  JEFF WILSON: I played -- I started off, I had a rough start and then the last two holes today are playing really hard.  I made two bogies.  But, I did some good stuff in the middle so all in all, okay.   Q.  Does the big stage get to you at all?  JEFF WILSON: Well, if you would have watched me yesterday I think you would have said probably so.  But, I mean there's some times where I don't feel very comfortable, like the shot on 17 that kind of plays into it a little bit, an uncomfortable shot and you're unsure and maybe you make a quick decision that if you're out at your place with your buddies you probably wouldn't. But, I don't know.  I'm happy just playing along these guys.  It's a thrill.   Q.  Does that you've made the cut and it's just you and Mike, does it make for a little internal competition at all?  JEFF WILSON: We probably had that before the cut even started.  I think he's probably got the best of me more than I've got of him.  But, you know, he's a good player.   Q.  With things in the balance like a spot maybe in the U.S. Amateur on the line, does that change your schedule?  Are you planning on playing the U.S. Amateur anyway?  JEFF WILSON: I'm going to help my daughter move into school and so I think -- the Mid Am I think I'll try for but the U.S. Amateur, no.  I've had a great time playing in those but, you know, those days are probably gone by.   Q.  What's your goal for tomorrow?  JEFF WILSON: You know, I just want to go out and play -- just play well and whatever number that is, so be it, you know, and hopefully I get off to a little better start than I have the last couple days.
