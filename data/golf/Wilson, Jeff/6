Q. A long run to get a chance finally at being --
JEFF WILSON: Feels really good, you know.  I played great today, and Chip showed why he's a USGA champion.  He was a tough out.
Q. How many of these have you played in now?  What's the number of USGA championships for you?
JEFF WILSON: I think this is 33 or 34.  They had it at 63, but I'm not even that old.  I think it's low 30s.
Q. I would have thought somewhere in the mid to low 30s.
JEFF WILSON: I think that's correct.
Q. So you think 34?
JEFF WILSON: 33, 34, somewhere in there.
Q. You've done this for so long, and you've been medalist, you've been semifinalist, you get to a final.  What would it mean for you to finally do this?  A career achievement?
JEFF WILSON: Every time I'm listed, the only thing missing is a win.  You know, I've enjoyed playing these things and I've had some success, but bottom line is I don't have one.
Q. You're playing tomorrow's -- he was in the same boat you were last year.
JEFF WILSON: I've got a shot.
Q. It was his 44th USGA championship and he finally got it.  McCoy has been there, he finally got one in the Mid-Am.
JEFF WILSON: It was a heck of a match this afternoon.  I don't know what we shot to par, but there was no give-in at all.  All those holes were earned out there.
Q. You were 2-down early.  What did you tell yourself after that to get yourself going?
JEFF WILSON: I just tried to keep on playing.  No. 1, I got it four feet for birdie and he's off the green for par and he makes it and I miss.  I was hitting the shots, I just hadn't gotten the results.  You know, I mean, like I said, I just had to play.  You know, it was evident that somebody was going to have to win it and not back into it.
Q. Was the turning point maybe No. 8, he's got like that little three-and-a-half-, four-footer, lips out, you end up winning the hole, and you got it back to square --
JEFF WILSON: Honestly, I think the turning point was 14 when -- I think it was 14 when I was 1-up, he was in with 4, and I had about an eight-footer for par, and I made it.  You know, that kept me up in the match.  Not that 1-up is a cushion, but it kept me up.  You know, I mean, you're not going to make all your eight-footers.  I think that was probably the biggest point in the match.
Q. Not many people take medalist honors and then stick around for the final, much less win this thing.
JEFF WILSON: Well, like I said, if I would have played Chip in any other round, I probably would have gotten beat.
Q. You were the semifinalist for the 2001 Mid-Am?
JEFF WILSON: Let me see, 2000, 2001 and 2004 Mid-Am.
Q. So those have been your three USGA semifinals?  No, just semifinals in '01.  What was the other one?
JEFF WILSON: Washington.
Q. San Joaquin was 2001.
JEFF WILSON: Okay, then the next year after that.
Q. 2002 at Stanwich?
JEFF WILSON: Yeah, I lost to Zahringer in the semis.  And then I've been to the quarters four times.
Q. Since then?
JEFF WILSON: Around then, since then, whatever.
