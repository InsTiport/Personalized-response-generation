 Q.  This match today, what do you think the difference was?  
JEFF WILSON: It was the front nine.  You know, I shot 39 on it three days in a row and that's just not good enough.  When you play a player like Stew, you know, you can't give away holes.   
 Q.  And is there something about the front nine that doesn't fit your eye?  
JEFF WILSON: I think we have a personality conflict.  (Laughter.)  I'm really not sure.  I played poorly.  Each time I played it I didn't play it very well.   
 Q.  Is there a key hole you thought may have swayed the match one way or the other, or just a combination of things?  
JEFF WILSON: You know, the par-5, I think I was still two down on about 12, the par-5.  I hit it on the front edge, which for me that's two pretty good pokes.   
Stew, he was a few yards in front of me and he hit it 25 feet; I had probably 110 feet.  I don't know how far it was.   
But, you know, he hit that shot there and that was kind of -- you know, if he doesn't hit that shot very well maybe makes my putt a little easier.  That shot was probably the one that really put me in jeopardy.   
 Q.  I know it's early to reflect on the whole summer, but all the things that you've accomplished, and then obviously even to get this far in a Mid Amateur, how do you feel about the whole summer?  
JEFF WILSON: I feel pretty good.  I mean, obviously winning in a USGA event is a dream.  Had I not won I would still be out here competing.   
 Q.  Is there something that motivates you to do more as you go along?  You're at a certain age where maybe you don't have to play anymore.  
JEFF WILSON: At some point in time, I don't know when it was, I hadn't really played that much in the last four or five years, I just decided I really like to play and nothing was going to change that.  Not a bad round, not a bad shot.   
And so here I am.
