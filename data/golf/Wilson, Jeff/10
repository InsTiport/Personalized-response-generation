 Q.  So just tell us a little bit about your round today.  How did you feel out there?  JEFF WILSON: I hit the ball plenty well enough to shoot a good score.  I just putted horribly.  I just wasn't quite comfortable, and I got tentative.  Then all of a sudden, it kind of builds.  I think I had 36 putts today.   Q.  Did I hear a 34 on the back nine there?  JEFF WILSON: That was the first nine for me, but yeah.   Q.  What was working for you there?  JEFF WILSON: I hit a lot of good shots.  I don't know what my stats were today, but I mean, I had a lot of good birdie looks.  I had several putts inside 10 feet.  I just didn't make very many of them. I played a pretty good nine holes right there on the front nine.  I came around, and I had my chances.  I just four-putted the 6th hole, I think it was, and that hurt a little bit, but it is what it is.   Q.  Do you feel like this course suits you well?  Can you get after it out there?  JEFF WILSON: I think I can shoot a good score out there.  I had a chance to shoot a good score today, and I didn't do it.  Maybe tomorrow I will.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll putt a little bit better.
