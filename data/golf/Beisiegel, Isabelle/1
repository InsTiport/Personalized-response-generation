PAUL ROVNAK:  You never teed off today?
ISABELLE BEISIEGEL:  No, I didn't.
Q.  How nice is that?
ISABELLE BEISIEGEL:  
I am very lucky.  I think it evens out at the end of the year, you know, what kind of tee times you get.

But definitely it is nice to not have teed off, but at the same time I think the officials made a good call to cancel the round, so I think it is fair for everybody.  I am happy we all get to go again tomorrow.
Q.  
Talk about that, canceling the round.  Some people are playing well, some people weren't playing well.
ISABELLE BEISIEGEL:  
Well, It is hard    you know, I respect the decision the officials make.  They try their hardest to go by the book, and it is hard to make calls because some people are going to be unhappy and some of them are going to be happy.  So, you know, you have to make a decision and go with it and I respect it, and it has happened to me before really.  I think it was US Open qualifier that actually a whole round that I finished was canceled.  So it's happened before.  I think it is fair.
Q.  What do you do today though the rest of the day?
ISABELLE BEISIEGEL:  
I'll try to find a matinee.  My husband is not in town.  I am pretty much just counting sheep.  So, I will try to occupy myself.
Q.  
Work out or anything?
ISABELLE BEISIEGEL:  
No.  I have already done my work out.  I've done my warm up this morning, so I was ready to go.
