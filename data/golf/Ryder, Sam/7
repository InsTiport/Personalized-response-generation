 Q.  Nice playing today, particularly the birdie-birdie finish to post 9-under par. Was the golf course any different today than yesterday?  
SAM RYDER: It was pretty similar. I think just playing in the -- we tee'd off at 7:15, first off, so the ball wasn't going as far. Got off to a really good start. Birdied 1 again. It's always seems like when you birdie the 1st hole it gets things going.   
Yeah, just had a really clean front nine. Yeah, other than the ball just kind of not going quite as far because it was chillier early, the greens still had some firmness to them. The course is in really, really good shape.   
So just seeing balls release on the greens I think has helped keep the scores at bay a little bit, not getting away from it. It would be nice if it doesn't rain and continues to firm up for the weekend.   
 Q.  Open with 65 yesterday, 66 today. What's the key for you on this golf course?  
SAM RYDER: I think I have a little different strategy than I had last time I played as a rookie. I'm being a little bit more aggressive off the tee. The rough is not super penal, so I'm just trying to get it down there a little bit, and even if I'm in the rough, deal with it.   
But when I hit the fairway, just being able to control the spin into some of those pins. Nothing really much changes. I think I'm just a little bit sharper right now with my game. Had a good off week with my coach up in Michigan, and just came in with some confidence. A little bit disappointing to end my year a little early earlier than I wanted to last year only making it to Northern Trust, but ready to go for the fall.   
 Q.  Any tough hole locations or holes out there you think players could struggle with today?  
SAM RYDER: I think there are a couple sneaky tough ones. One of the tougher ones was the par-3. What is it, No. 15? 15, the long par-3. Kind of tucked right behind.   
Even some where you might have wedges in they're sneaky. I think they kind of put them right on some crests and edges of some slopes. So it's like 18. You know, you can get rewarded with a good shot, but if you're just off you kind of hit a little swale and it's easy to fall to 25, 30 feet.   
But the course is fair and rewarding good shots. It's out there. Guys are hitting fairways and hitting quality shots into greens.
