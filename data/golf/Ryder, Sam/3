 Q.  Are you happy with your round? You got it to 3-under par with birdies on three of four holes. Leaving the 10th green, and you just kind of make pars on the way in, except for a hiccup there at 16. Are you happy with what you got out of the day?  
SAM RYDER: Yeah. Well, if you told me to start the day that I would be in the position I'm in I would have taken it I'm sure, but I just played really solid. Kind of have a bad taste in my mouth right now actually because I played so well. The bogey, the three-putt, I mean, I caught a gust of wind and I had a two-footer. I mean, I took my time, marked it, but like I caught a gust of wind and it broke a cup. It was kind of a fluke thing horseshoe lipped out, so that was frustrating.   
Then 18 I had a 6-iron in and walked away with a par. I feel like I could have got it in at 7 pretty easily, but I'm still happy with it. I'm driving the ball great, playing solid. It was very stress-free. Stress-free in these conditions is always a good thing.   
 Q.  Three-putt happened back at the 16th hole. Talk about your ball striking, because I have you hitting 15 of 18 greens here.  
SAM RYDER: Yeah, it's been as good as it's been in a while, probably since the fall of the 2018 I would say when I went on a really good stretch.   
But, yeah, I got from some good work with my coach, Adam Schreiber, back home over the break, and I feel really good with my swing. I'm driving it great. That contributes to hitting so many greens.   
When you're putting it in the fairway, especially the way it is playing right now, lift, clean, and place, it makes it a lot easier.   
The goal has been to try and be as stress-free as possible and hit as many greens, not try and short-side myself or get too aggressive. Pars are good right now. Yeah, hitting 15 greens is going to help.
