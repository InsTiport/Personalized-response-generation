 Q.  Sam, 67. Just comment a little bit on a difficult day out there with those conditions. Great start.  
SAM RYDER: Yeah, I'm pleased with it. I think I'm a little tournament rusty. I haven't played since Sea Island. I think in a way the conditions kind of helped that because I wasn't really focused on being too perfect out there. Just the way, the nature of the conditions with a lot of wind, a little soft, a little different.   
So it was more just a trying day. You're just going to keep the ball in front of and you play as solid as you can and hit as many greens and fairways as possible.   
Yeah, so I think it helped in a way, and I was able to get off to a pretty good start and stay patient. Got on a nice little run there and made four straight between 7 and 10 and gave a couple back.   
Not really hitting really poor shots, but there is a very fine line out here right now with the conditions and the wind, so finishing with a birdie was nice to get one back at the last.   
Yeah, it was a good day.
