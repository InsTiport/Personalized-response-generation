Q. Really nice round. Really solid back nine for you and I thought you had a great look at 18. But still, 4-under 68, your thoughts on how you played today?
BRENDON TODD: Definitely take an opening 68 here at Bay Hill. I thought we, it's a favorable draw getting to play early without the wind and for the first six, seven holes. Jumped out with a couple birdies there on 2 and 3. And I was driving it really good, I bet I only missed one or two fairways today so it gave me a lot of opportunities to attack the flags and stuff. And it was nice to make a couple good par saves there on 14 and 17 after running my first putts by. And then getting a couple birdies there on 16 and 13.
Q. I looked at your record here, it hasn't been stellar. What changed today? What got you the confidence to shoot that round?
BRENDON TODD: I'm coming in here with confidence. Just I'm such a better player than I was in 2016, obviously, and feel like even 2012 when I played. So I just feel like my game's in a good spot and if I'm hitting the ball solid I can play anywhere, even at this place, and not just long and challenging for me.
