  Q. What a great putt.  I know you had a couple 10-footers slide by the hole on Wednesday against Harris English.  Those dropped for you today.  What a great 2 to close out the match.
 BRENDON TODD:   Yeah, thanks.  I made birdies from start to finish, and I think the lob wedge and the putter were the stars of the show today.  Hit four or five lob wedges in there close and made a couple clutch putts, so it was nice.
 Q. If you were hitting good lob wedges, that means you were hitting good drivers, too?
 BRENDON TODD:   Yeah, it sure does, but it was mostly on the par-5s and some of those shorter 4s where I got lob wedge in my hand, on 1 and 10 and and the par-5, 12, 13 again.  It was a good day all around.
 Q. Late on Tuesday afternoon, I was driving the golf course and drove by the practice putting green and pointed to you and said to my cart driver, "There's a guy that could win the whole thing that no one even is looking at right now."  I think you're built for match play; the way you putt, I think you're just made for this golf course.
 BRENDON TODD:   I do believe it's a great golf course for me.  Kevin Kisner and Matt Kuchar continue to prove that with their good play, and yeah, I appreciate the compliment.  When my putter is on, I'm hard to beat.
 Q. The group is certainly a mishmash with everyone winning and losing, so it's going to be an exciting Friday for you.
 BRENDON TODD:   It sure will, so it looks like we're probably headed to a playoff maybe tomorrow, so we'll see.  Hopefully I can get a W and get in that playoff.
