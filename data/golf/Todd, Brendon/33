 Q.   The 2014 Byron Nelson Champion, how does that sound?   
BRENDON TODD:   Sounds amazing.   I appreciate it.   It was a tough day, lots of emotions, but it's been great.   
   
 Q.   I have to say that the bunker shot on the second kick‑started things for you.   
BRENDON TODD:   That's a correct assumption there, that shot was amazing.   I've been working on my bunker game all week and it's been feeling really good and that happened to pop in there.  
   
 Q.   You looked so complete to me from tee through green, especially down the backside, tee shots off 14 and then on 18 it looked like you felt confident.   
BRENDON TODD:   My golf swing has been a work in progress, and it's been steady and I was able to rely on it today, but my short game was on fire.   That's what really got me through.   
   
 Q.   So did you look at any leaderboards coming down the final round?   
BRENDON TODD:   I never looked at the leaderboard.   I asked my caddy off 17 tee where I stood.   He told me 2 up.   If we just tried to confirm that walking up the 18th green before I putted.   
   
 Q.   A very happy Brendon Todd here, winner of the HP Byron Nelson Champion, Brendon you join a long list of first‑time winners this season on the PGA TOUR, what are your emotions like?   
BRENDON TODD:   I'm thrilled about this week.   Such an exciting time, winning my first PGA TOUR event and I wouldn't be happier.   
   
 Q.   Talking to you before the round you seemed a touch nervous yet you were able to put that into positive energy with a bogey‑free 66.   How did you do that?   
BRENDON TODD:   Incredible short game, saved me time and time again with the haul out on 2 and the up and down on 3 and the left hand shot on 13.   It was an amazing day.   
   
 Q.   This is a life‑changing win for you, TOUR exemption, you get into the masters, what's the biggest thrill out of getting this victory?   
BRENDON TODD:   Definitely the Masters, so I'm excited about going to Augusta.  
THE MODERATOR:   Congratulations.
