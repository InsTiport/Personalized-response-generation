 Q.   Pretty good playing.   You got hot on the back side?  
BRENDON TODD:   I did.   I hung in there.   Front nine I was doing everything well.   Nice speed on the greens.   It was nice to get some putts on the back.  
   
 Q.   You're a really good putter, and these fast greens really suit your game?  
BRENDON TODD:   They do.   Coming from wet Texas, I didn't putt very well down there.   And I think it's just that the greens were a little slower, more moisture, bumpier.   And I get used to fast greens and just hit them out a little quicker.  
   
 Q.   You got up and down in some good spots, too, to really keep the round going.   You've got to be pleased with some of that stuff, too?  
BRENDON TODD:   Definitely.   I did everything well.   I got up and down on 2 there.   Great up‑and‑downs on 15 for birdie, 16 for par, 17 for par.   That's what held the round together.   Now I'll try to do more this weekend.  
   
 Q.   Always good to birdie the last hole.   I saw a little fist pump there?  
BRENDON TODD:   Always when it's 485 and tough pin.   That's the best birdie of the day.   
   
 Q.   A great birdie on the difficult 18th hole to get you at 5‑under par after your opening day.   What were you doing so well out there today?  
BRENDON TODD:   I was hitting fairways.   I hit 13 fairways today.   I was hitting my putts on line, although a little too hard at first, and then holed a few on the back.   If you drive it on the fairway and make putts out here, you can do well.  
   
 Q.   I have to say that you've been playing poorly in 2015, but I know you want to get back to the way you were playing in 2014.   What does a round like this do for your confidence?  
BRENDON TODD:   It's big.   I made a‑‑ I had a couple good first rounds here in the last few months.   
The important thing is to go out tomorrow and play solid and get myself in position for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Did you guys feed off each other a little bit, perhaps?  
BRENDON TODD:   I would say so.   Ryan played an exceptional front nine there, playing 3 through 7, I think, in 5‑under.   And then I went the other way, I shot even on the front and 5‑under on the back.   I think we both kind of kept each other interested in the round.  
   
 Q.   Is it easy right now?   Is it soft?  
BRENDON TODD:   I would say the golf course played pretty easy for here.   The fairways were good, we were getting a little bit of roll.   And the greens were perfect, receptive.   
You felt like you could attack those holes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and even 8.   They had some front pins that were accessible if you hit good shots.  
   
 Q.   You can't win it on Thursday, but you can certainly play yourself out.   But just coming off a round like this, what does it do for your mojo?  
BRENDON TODD:   It's good.   I haven't played my best here over the last month, but all the areas have kind of been trending the right direction.   I've been swinging well the last couple of weeks.   I started putting better at Colonial.   Really trying to work on my speed.   
This is a tough place.   This is probably the fastest greens we've seen this year, maybe including Augusta.   For me I had bad speed a couple of times today, but I was able to hole a couple of putts on the back nine.  
   
 Q.   They're speedy, but true, right?  
BRENDON TODD:   They're really good.   They're rolling great.   And I felt like I was putting a lot of putts on line, but I was hitting just a little too hard.  
   
 Q.   Anything you did specifically coming into this week that has gotten you to where you were able to play today?  
BRENDON TODD:   Yeah, you know, I felt like I swung it really well last week in Dallas, although I missed the cut.   I didn't go home and try to rework anything, I just rested.   And then I just put a lot of work in there on my short game the last couple of days, and it seemed to pay off.   I got a bunch of balls up and down today and starting to get some putts on line.   I'm feeling better with those areas of my game.  
   
 Q.   Anything you're going to do specifically to try to keep up with today's pace?  
BRENDON TODD:   It's always a good habit, especially for here, I'm going to go out there and work on my wedges and chipping and putting a little this afternoon, just try and make sure I stay sharp in those areas.  
   
 Q.   What was the one shot today that maybe you're most proud of?  
BRENDON TODD:   I think it was probably the par save on 16, the putt I made there from 10 or 12 feet up the hill.   It really kept the round going.   It kept my positive.   
I think it's that part of the game that I struggle with, especially there at The PLAYERS, and then at Colonial.   I had some great rounds going there, and just finished poorly in a bunch of rounds there those two weeks.   So to finish this round well is huge.  
   
 Q.   Short game, putting is usually your strength?  
BRENDON TODD:   Yeah, it definitely is.   But unlike everybody else, if it's not sharp, it's not sharp.   And I need my short game to be exceptional out here.  
   
 Q.   This morning you had good weather?  
BRENDON TODD:   Right.   
   
 Q.   Some receptive greens?  
BRENDON TODD:   Right.   
   
 Q.   Fast, but soft.   Is this about as ideal as it's been for a round you played out here?  
BRENDON TODD:   Like I said, I felt like 2 through 7, I ended up playing 1‑under par, I was a little bummed I didn't play that stretch better.   But I was able to capitalize on the back nine and put up some birdies and put up a good round.   
I felt like both sides were playing about as easy as they could today.
