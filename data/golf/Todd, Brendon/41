 Q.   Brendon, 3‑under today.   Solid play, just one bogey there on the last probably leaves a little bit of a bad taste in your mouth, but overall in great shape?  
BRENDON TODD:   A little bit.   Only bad because I drove it so well all day, and just hit the little pool on 18 and to come off with a bogey is not what you want to do there.   
But that's a tough hole.   There were a lot of tough holes out there.   I was happy to shoot 3‑under out there.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the conditions.   You had nine or ten holes, I guess, of pretty nasty?   
BRENDON TODD:   Yeah, what's tough is the first ten holes out here are brick hard on the greens.   Then we turned to the back nine and it started raining.   We already had soft greens and rain to deal with, which actually maybe sort of negated each other because playing the soft greens is maybe a little bit easier.   
You know, me and my caddie just went through our process and grinded through it.  
   
 Q.   Just a few back heading into the weekend.   Talk about your mindset?   
BRENDON TODD:   I'm just going to keep playing my game.   I think what's interesting is everybody is playing a different golf course tomorrow, so you never know where everybody's at.   
Playing Peninsula Club third is going to be nice because there are probably more birdies out there than most of the other places.   So I'm excited to go out there and see how low I can go and get into contention for Sunday.
