Q.   Brendon, another really solid round of golf.   That's three pretty consistent rounds of golf this week.
BRENDON TODD:   Yeah.   I played solid today.   The conditions were tough with the wind, and you know, just sticking to my game, trying to hit fairways and greens and see if I can hole some putts.

Q.   A little bit back and forth last year from tour to tour, Web.com and the regular TOUR.   You got off to a great start this year with a 12th and a 26 so far.   What's the difference?
BRENDON TODD:   Consistent ball striking has been the key this year.   And I've gained a lot of confidence from playing both tours and playing well on both tours this year. 
So I've just rolled that into the fall.   I've learned a lot the last couple of years with my struggles and some of my successes, and I've just been able to sort of put it all together now.

Q.   You've put yourself in a great position.   Good luck tomorrow.
BRENDON TODD:   All right.   Thanks a lot.
