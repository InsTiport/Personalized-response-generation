 Q.   Great tournament overall.   How do you feel about the four days out here?  
BRENDON TODD:   It was a good week.   23 under par is pretty good shooting for four days.   A little disappointed coming in.   I missed the green with some wedges and really didn't capitalize on a couple of opportunities.   But, Patrick played great and it was fun to get some experience in the final group.   
   
 Q.   Do you think that after four days you played well enough to win the tournament, it just happened to be one guy going so low?  
BRENDON TODD:   I think on the PGA TOUR, first and second place, you generally played good enough to win a tournament anywhere in the world.   It's just the toughest TOUR to play competitively, I think.   And I think I played really well this week and it was good enough for fifth.   
   
 Q.   Going into the round do you feel like you had a legitimate shot at catching Patrick or was your outlook more playing for second place?  
BRENDON TODD:   No, I thought I had a legitimate chance and I got off to a good enough start with four birdies through 6 I think to make a run.   Just in the middle of the round I stalled out.   I lipped out on 9, 10, and 13 and really wasn't able to recover from those lipouts.   They really hurt.  
   
 Q.   What do you think was the difference between your front nine, like you said, you had four birdies in five holes, and the back nine, where it seemed like you were pretty steady with pars and couldn't get anything going?  
BRENDON TODD:   It was just the putts going into the hole.   I hit great putts on 9 and 10 and they didn't go in like they did on 4.   And I didn't hit those wedges close coming in.   I hit my wedges really bad today, so something to work on.   
   
 Q.   Overall, at this point in the early in the season, how would you rate your form, your game right now?  
BRENDON TODD:   It's been really good.   Really steady.   I'm way under par for the year, every round I feel like I've got a good chance to go out and shoot in the 60s.   So I'm in a good spot and I just need to regroup from the last few holes there and just move on and take some positives from today.  
   
 Q.   Are you playing San Diego next week?  
BRENDON TODD:   I am going to play Torrey Pines.   I feel like going into there with a good mindset, you know, it's a tough place, and I feel like I'm playing well to compete.   
   
 Q.   Where is your confidence right now?  
BRENDON TODD:   My confidence is pretty high.   I know that I just need to take a rest, tighten up on the wedges and I'll be ready to go again.
