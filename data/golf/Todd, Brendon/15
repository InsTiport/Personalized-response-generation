Q.   Quite a Sunday afternoon out there.   You gave it a shot, big battle, thoughts on how you played today?
BRENDON TODD:   I played solid.   Pretty happy with the start I had there, 3‑under through 5 and 4 on the front.   Just wasn't able to get anything around on the back nine. 

Q.   How much scoreboard watching did you do on the back nine?
BRENDON TODD:   Not at all.   I just tried to go out there and play and make some birdies.   I asked my caddie how Jim finished on the last.

Q.   Some thoughts on your game as you go into next week?
BRENDON TODD:   I feel great.   Got one week off before the Match Play and THE PLAYERS.   I feel like I'm making strides on the greens, which is key for me.   I hit it pretty solid the past couple of weeks. 

Q.   To start out with an over‑par round through this week and then end up where you ended up, how satisfied are you?
BRENDON TODD:   I feel great.   I think I went 17‑under the last three days, which is pretty good out here.   And throw out the two bogeys I made on 14 the first day, I think I'm right there in the playoffs.   It's one of those tough holes.

Q.   Playing in the final group and chasing the leader, how are the emotions?
BRENDON TODD:   The last group is always tough.   But I felt really good today, pretty calm.   It was nice to play with an old college roommate, Kevin Kisner.   We had a great rhythm all day.   I don't think either one of us felt too nervous until the end, probably.   I just had to play a good round and watch him play great.

Q.   I know every week is an education, what do you take out of this?
BRENDON TODD:   When I'm playing well, saving pars, making birdies I'm right there, just as good as anybody else.   I'm excited to get back (inaudible).
