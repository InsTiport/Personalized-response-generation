 Q.  Brendon Todd, 4-under, and I'm not sure what's more impressive, the fact that you put up that low number with really tough afternoon conditions or the fact that you did it as a first-timer.  You have to be proud of yourself.  BRENDON TODD: I am, yeah.  I played solid today.  I was fortunate last year to come here as an alternate, get some good practice rounds in, so I was a little bit more prepared for the first time than normal.   Q.  Had you ever seen this course before?  A lot of first-timers say they've been here for a Junior Players or they'd come here just to practice with buddies before.  Had you ever seen the course before in non-tournament shape?  BRENDON TODD: I've played it twice, once when I was 11 and then one pro-am a couple years ago, so not many times.   Q.  How different was the format and just the shape of the course compared to when you saw it before?  BRENDON TODD: The greens were a lot firmer and faster today than the last time I played here, and the winds were blowing a little harder.  But it was a good test, and happy to be out of there with 4-under.   Q.  Conditions definitely have gotten tougher as the day goes on, so are you happy with your position because teeing off in the morning tomorrow, hopefully the wind stays down and you'll be able to go even deeper.  BRENDON TODD: Definitely.  I do think there might have been a couple more low scores this afternoon than the morning for some reason, but I can't argue with second and third place for the first round, so look forward to the morning round.
