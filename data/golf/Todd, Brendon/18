  BRENDON TODD:   It was a lot of fun.   First Par 3 Contest.   I wanted to pick a couple of my buddies.   It's fun to go around there and kind of cut up and make some birdies.  
   
 Q.   Having family out here on the bag?  
BRENDON TODD:   Yeah, Even better.   Definitely the best part was carrying my son, six‑month‑old boy, all over, showing him off to the crowd.   
   
 Q.   Better than expected?   As expected?   
BRENDON TODD:   Probably a little better than expected.   I knew it was going to be a good time.  
   
 Q.   How did you shoot?  
BRENDON TODD:   I shot 3‑under.   Played good.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like it helped your game at all?  
BRENDON TODD:   No.   
   
 Q.   Just for fun?   
BRENDON TODD:   Just fun.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel heading into tomorrow?  
BRENDON TODD:   I feel good.   I feel like I'm doing everything pretty well.   Have had good practice.   I've done everything I can possibly do to get ready for my first Masters.   Whatever comes my way, I'm just going to have to deal with and shoot as low as I can.  
   
 Q.   You are hearing "Go Dawgs" around here a little bit?  
BRENDON TODD:   Yeah, I mean, one of the hometown guys.   Being a Georgia guy, feeling like the crowd is always with me.
