 Q.   Solid round of golf, 17 of 18, no bogeys, you've got to be happy about that.   The golf course, when you look at the scoring, seems like all the guys that have a high content of greens in regulation seems to help.   Everybody's making birdies but it's staying away from the mistakes?  
BRENDON TODD:   Yeah I would agree with that.   This golf course gives you a lot of chances to score.   There's some short par 4s, reachable par 5s.   I did a good job today to give myself a lot of looks and eliminating those moments where you might make a bogey.  
   
 Q.   Similarities to the Byron Nelson, bermudagrass and wind, the greens are a little different and a lot bigger and all that other stuff but there is some similarities there?  
BRENDON TODD:   I do like bermudagrass and usually putt pretty well on that surface.   The breeze does reward good ballâ€‘striking, so you do have to control your ball in the wind and hole a few different shots.   
   
 Q.   Is this your first time here?   
BRENDON TODD:   It is.  
   
 Q.   What was your impression, first time on the property?   
BRENDON TODD:   I think just the hilly terrain and the beautiful views.   Everybody says it's one of the prettiest golf courses you'll ever play, and it's definitely living up to that hype.   Almost every hole you're on, you have a view of the ocean, you might see a whale splash and easy to escape the reality of the golf.   
   
 Q.   What's the hardest part to learn about the golf course?   What are the keys you picked up quickly?   
BRENDON TODD:   Well, I think usually if the wind blows heavily like it can here, that can be pretty tough for a first timer because it's going to blow heavier than what we are used to.   It's going to maybe surprise you and cause you to make a big number every once in awhile.   
We're having pretty calm conditions.   So I think it allows the golf course to play just kind of the way it normally would, which is if you put the ball in the fairway, you're going to have some chances to make some birdies.
