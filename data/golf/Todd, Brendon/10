Q. 5-under 66 today; how were you able to get that score?
BRENDON TODD: Well, it took me a while.  I made a birdie on the first hole and slowed down.  I made bogey on 14 and then missed a short one on 15 for birdie, ended up only 1-under to make the turn.  But a couple great birdies there, a chip-in on 2 and a nice 20-footer on 3 got me going, and then finished strong, birdie on the last, 9.
Q. You only hit 10 greens in regulation, and it seemed like your short game really kept this round on course for you.
BRENDON TODD: It did, yeah.  I was chipping really well.  I got in some good work here the last couple days, and I know I need it this week.  I need to finish well to advance.
Q. How much is that part of your mindset for the entire week as far as the finish you need?
BRENDON TODD: Yeah, it's a big focus point.  This is the one week a year where you really know going in what the number is before you get out there, that I need to finish here.  I'm just going to go out there and see if I can get it done.
Q. I don't know the math; have you done much of the math, what you've got to do?
BRENDON TODD: I looked at it briefly.  I know top 5 probably guarantees getting to the TOUR Championship, and probably in the 6, 7, 8, 9 range I have an outside chance.
Q. You had a taste of it last year?
BRENDON TODD: Right.
Q. What was that taste like, and how badly do you want it this year?
BRENDON TODD: It was fantastic.  As great of an event as it is, it sets up the next year so you can play all four majors, a couple World Golf Championships, and you make a little extra cash, so it's a huge motivator for me.  We're all trying to make the TOUR Championship.
