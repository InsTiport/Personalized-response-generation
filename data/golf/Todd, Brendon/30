 Q.   Another solid round today.   Just talk about how you played out there?   
BRENDON TODD:   Yeah, I played pretty steady today.   I think more solid off the tee and into the greens than I had the first two days, but I didn't have as many close shots, I didn't feel like.   I was able to make a couple nice par saves on 14, 15, and getting birdies on 17 coming in.  
   
 Q.   David played a great round out there today.   How is that, in terms of playing, is that good for the fellow golfer to see good golf?   
BRENDON TODD:   Definitely.   I think David has been one of the best guys for me to play with in the last year.   In Greensboro in the fall, he shot 62, I shot 64 in the last round, and Hilton Head, I think he shot 70.   I might have shot 68 when we played together.   Obviously, today we both had it going.   He just does everything really well at a nice, even pace, which is really easy to play with.  
   
 Q.   You have 5‑under right in the hunt.   What's it going to take tomorrow to take home that plaid jacket?   
BRENDON TODD:   I'm not really sure.   I think somebody out of this group of 5, 6, 7‑under is probably going to put up a good round.   So I might need to shoot 5‑under to get to 10 to honestly have a good chance.   I think over the years you've seen somebody wins a tournament with a really low round at the end.
