  Q. Brendon, how good was that round out there today?
 BRENDON TODD:   It was pretty awesome.  It was assisted by some really good putting.  I made a couple bombs out there and saved a couple pars.  I've been able to put up some rounds like that this year and was pretty excited to do it today.
 Q. How difficult is the test out there?
 BRENDON TODD:   It's really hard I think for everybody because when you get it in the rough, it's just a huge question mark and you're just trying to get back in position, and the greens are borderline concrete by the end of the day.
 Q. Do you feel like it's a fair test?
 BRENDON TODD:   I do, yeah.  I think it's really good.
 Q. Do you like it when it gets kind of firm and fast and this hard?
 BRENDON TODD:   I do.  Any time you have to hit fairways and play smart and make some par saves usually fits into my game pretty well, and I think so far this week I've done that really, really good, and hopefully I'll do it on the weekend.
 Q. 2-under today is equal to how good last week?
 BRENDON TODD:   Probably 63 I would say.  I wouldn't put it in the 59 or 60 category, but it's a good round last week.
 Q. Kis just said he thinks even par wins the tournament.  Do you agree?
 BRENDON TODD:   I do.  I don't see how the greens are going to soften up that much.  I think even par is going to be a great score.
