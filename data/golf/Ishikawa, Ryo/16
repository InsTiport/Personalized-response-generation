Q.   How did it go out there? 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   It was really windy, and I think everybody had a hard time.   But I putted really well. 

Q.   You really got hot on the back nine.   What turned it around? 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   It was surprising.   I know it's way harder on the back nine, but it's surprising that I played really well on the back nine.

Q.   Were there any shots in particular that kept you going? 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   I know sometimes I have to cut the back, fade to ball, to the left, to the right, so I'm controlling all those shots. 

Q.   Talk about your mindset going into Sunday. 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   If I play good and I can finish in the top 10, that would be a great result for me.
