   RYO ISHIKAWA: On the 15th hole it was a situation where, if we halved the hole, we would win the match. And the American Team is a great team, so I wanted to focus and play well to the end.   
 Mr. Yang told me, you don't have to hurry, we can play at our pace, and that helped me out a lot.   
  
  Q. You said you wanted to give Mr. Norman a point. How does it feel?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: It was a very important point. I wanted to win, and to have one on the second day was great. But there are three more rounds, so I want to do my best and contribute to a victory.   
  
  Q. You seemed to play well today, especially your iron play.   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: My body felt better today, better than yesterday. My driver and iron shots were better, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   
  
  Q. How do you feel going into tomorrow?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Whoever we go up against, they are going to be really good. Kenny Perry and Sean O'Hair played hard till the end. I think it was a great match today. Whoever we go up against, I want to follow what Mr. Yang said and play my game.
