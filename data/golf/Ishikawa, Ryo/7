 Q.   What do you get out of the last two weeks?  
RYO ISHIKAWA:   I've played well these two months, like since Web.com finals, the second one.   I played well the last three events in the finals.   I had three top 10s and a week off and then starting a new season this 2013 and '14 was‑‑ I had a great start, definitely a great start.   
I'm very confident for my long game and getting better for my short game, so my game is good now.  
   
 Q.   When you looked at the leaderboard, did you have any thoughts you could win?  
RYO ISHIKAWA:   I wish I could made a couple putts, like three putts.   I missed a lot of putts this week, like 10 feet, 15 feet, 20 feet.   I missed a lot.   
But still, third.   I'm pretty happy with that result and I really didn't see that board because of Webb.   He runs so fast today.   I saw 20‑under after his front nine or first few holes.   But he recovered from this score.   
So I thought of trying to get second.   Almost I did it.   But still happy with that.   
   
 Q.   What's your schedule the rest of the year?  
RYO ISHIKAWA:   I don't play next week in Malaysia.   I mean China, HSBC.   I play that event.   And I'm thinking about playing Georgia.
