 Q. How difficult was it for to you play golf this afternoon in light of everything that's happened today?
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Without really knowing too much about the assessment or extent of damage, I cannot talk too much about the earthquake itself. 
 But I realize with the extent of coverage here, it must be a very grave situation in Japan. Many of the PGA players walked up to me such as Ernie Els and Vijay Singh, and asked how was my family and showed a lot of concern, and I appreciated that. 
 I tried my best to block everything out, but as you can imagine, it's a tough day.

 Q. Did it become more difficult in the afternoon, because in the morning, you birdied two of the six holes. 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: It wasn't so much that. It was simply that the Blue Monster decided to be what it's known to be.
 Yesterday was under softer conditions. I was able to do what I did. Today, I just had to deal with what the course faced me with. 

 Q. The players asked how your family is; how is your family? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I received communication from my father, and the message was, focus on your golf, we are fine, do what you need to do. 

 Q. Do you like your position? You're still tied for 17th. .
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Not a bad position I think, but the 4-over par golf today, I am not happy at all about. I wanted to be a little bit more tenacious and hang in there a little tougher. I do have 36 holes more of golf. I would like to show you what I can do.
