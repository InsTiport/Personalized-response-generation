Q.   3â€‘under par, 69; are you happy with that round? 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah, absolutely.   I'll take that result. Today with the windy conditions and unusual direction from the wind, so it was pretty tough conditions out there.

Q.   Was that about the best you could get out of that round? 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah.   I got three good shots in the last hole, the ninth, which is a great shot and a great putt on the third shot.   I'm enjoyed for that.

Q.   What part of your game helped you the most today? 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Short game, my short game is getting better.
