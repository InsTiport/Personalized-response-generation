  Q. How did it go today? How did you play?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Yesterday I was really nervous, and not so much today. If you had to put a number on it, I was 100 percent nervous yesterday, and 70 percent nervous today.   
 But I played well. I hit the driver really well, all day. I just wasn't able to follow up with some good iron shots and some good putts. I really need to work on my putting.   
 I was really happy to be able to play on the PGA TOUR. I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to play all four days, but I did learn a lot. Even though I only played two days and missed the cut, I don't look at it as a failure. It gives me more incentive to work harder on my game to be able to play at this level.   
 The reason why I missed the cut was I didn't hit the shots I should have. Of course, pressure and nerves had something to do with it.   
  
  Q. Were you thinking about the cut as you played today?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: After I 3-putted at No. 5, I knew I was outside the cut and didn't have much of a chance. And finally, I put some good swings on two irons at 6 and 7 and birdied both of those holes. I hit a 5-iron at No. 6 and at 7, I had 109 yards and hit an approach wedge to about four feet and made the putt.   
 I hit every drive almost perfect today. I was a lot more aggressive than I was yesterday. I went for every pin. Since I began golfing eight years ago, I've always dreamed to be able to perform on this stage at the PGA TOUR, and being able to play here the last two days has been a dream come true for me.
