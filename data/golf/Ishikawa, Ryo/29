 Q. What was the key today to your round?
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I thought I was going to go the wrong direction today, but I missed about a one meter putt there on 14 and I just had a bad feeling, but at the same time that I recovered from that and I did okay overall. 

 Q. This is your first cut that you made at the Masters. What does that mean to you?
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I think I'm just so happy. This is my dream. I'm looking forward to playing the next couple days, Saturday and Sunday, and I will look to move forward. 

 Q. What's going to be your game plan moving forward?
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I think I would like to be aggressive and I'm aiming towards the 60s the next two days and minus five for each day, so that's my goal. 

 Q. Now about Japan and the earthquake, have you spoken to your family and is everything okay?
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Again, my family and friends are fine and, but I just feel for those people there, but I would like to encourage them by my good play here at Augusta. 

 Q. How hard is it to concentrate on your golf when you were at Doral, the earthquake, now at the Masters. You must feel so good that you have accomplished something by making the cut at a Major here at the Masters. 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I've been here, I've been in the United States for two months and I never made a cut until this point, but finally I made a cut on a big stage here and so I'm very happy about that and it's just been great. 

 Q. So do you think this will lift the spirits of the people in Japan?
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I'm happy that I made a cut, but at the same time it's just that I made a cut, so the next two days as I play and if I do really well, then I think that there will be encouragement to the people in Japan.
