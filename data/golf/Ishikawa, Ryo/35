   SCOTT CROCKETT: I'll start you off, Ryo, just give us your thoughts on today, a very good performance. You must be very pleased. 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: As usual, when I play golf, the weather is really changeable. Sometimes it's a very nice day and sometimes a very rainy day. So with these conditions, it's really difficult to play. However, today I really think my putting was excellent and I really enjoyed it. 
 That's why I think I did a very good play, in fact.
 SCOTT CROCKETT: Did you enjoy the Scottish galleries? The Scottish fans enjoyed your tartan trousers, wearing a tartan; you are now an adopted Scot. 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: This week I have this opportunity to wear my tartan trousers, and I will wear my next tartan trousers for next week, and I would like to have that opportunity to wear my -- another pair for next week. 
 SCOTT CROCKETT: Is that the Ishikawa tartan? (Laughter) If not, perhaps you can market that as the Ishikawa tartan. 

 Q. Playing with Phil Mickelson and Villegas, a very big group with lots of fans; did you enjoy that aspect of today, too? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I played with great players like Phil Mickelson and Camilo Villegas. They are wonderful players, and then I enjoyed, as well, it was very much a great opportunity for me to challenge. However I thought that people that see me might be the lowest level, but today I had such a big Scottish gallery here, and now it's my pleasure to play with the Scottish gallery, as well. 
 SCOTT CROCKETT: Thank you very much and well played today and good luck for tomorrow.
