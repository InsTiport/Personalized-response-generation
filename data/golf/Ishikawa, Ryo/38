  Q. General thoughts on your round today?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Yeah, I was very happy to play with Tom Watson and Rory McIlroy.  
  
  Q. You have played with Rory a lot. Have you played with Tom much?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Yeah, close up very tough for me, and very hard green. So maybe tomorrow is more hard, difficult.  
  
  Q. Seemed like after every birdie you responded with a birdie, was there a reason for that?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Yeah, that was my goal.   
  
  Q. Your back nine you were almost out-of-bounds?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Yeah, but I got birdie opportunities every hole. So it's a great thing.  
  
  Q. Are you going to do anything differently tomorrow when you play in the morning?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I have just play my golf tomorrow, too.  
  
  Q. Did you learn anything playing with Tom Watson today?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Yes, his golf is very helpful. And talking about courses in Japan.   
  
  Q. Are you getting more comfortable playing in Majors now? You're starting playing in a bunch of them, are you feeling more comfortable playing in them?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Yes, tomorrow is going to be a big day and I'm excited, yeah.
