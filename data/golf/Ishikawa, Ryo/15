Q.   How was it today?
RYO ISHIKAWA:   It was pretty tough.   Tough round for me.   Maybe for everyone. 
I played with Ricky and Dustin, those guys are, I know these guys are playing good so far this year, but I'm feeling very good and I was able to focus on my golf today. 

Q.   How much tougher was the course today compared to even yesterday?
RYO ISHIKAWA:   The greens are getting firmer and the fairways also.   So it's very difficult off the tee with the landing the ball in the fairway. 
And the ninth hole I hit pitching wedge off the second shot, maybe 130 yards carry and then running maybe 30 yards.   So it's almost like a British Open. 

Q.   How difficult were holes 1‑6?
RYO ISHIKAWA:   I made bogey on 5 and 7, so ‑‑ I mean, number 7 is the most difficult green, but it's the shortest hole.   It's very tough, I think.

Q.   What's it like to see a guy like Michael Thompson go out there and put up a 4‑under?   Do you feel like you have that in you?
RYO ISHIKAWA:   No, I just tried to keep par today.   I tried to keep the par low today.   So I'm very tired right now, especially mentally.   So I'm going to rest tonight, so hopefully I'll play well tomorrow too.
