  Q. Thoughts on the day.   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Y.E. and I got together and we wanted to play hard today, and we were able to hang in there for a while. The 36 holes that I played today is going to be very special and will help me in my career.   
 We have been playing under tough rules with the formats, but when I play my singles match tomorrow, I might miss having a teammate with me. I want to do well and be able to get a point for our team.
