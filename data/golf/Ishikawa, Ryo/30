 Q. Did you hear about the latest earthquake, and how does that make you feel? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I got to know the news this morning when I saw it on the internet. I think I'm worried that it feels like we can't relax because of the situation. I am a bit worried.

 Q. Have you talked to anyone in your family? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I haven't talked to anyone.

 Q. How did you find out the news, because it happened about a half hour to an hour after you teed off? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I didn't know about it. That was news to me. I thought it was a different earthquake.

 Q. You didn't know about --
 RYO ISHIKAWA: No.

 Q. So you just found out now. 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I think it is very serious. I think it is. 

 Q. How difficult would it have been for you to play knowing that news like two of your competitors from Japan? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I think the best thing I can do is to play golf and play well. I would love to go back to Japan, but I think I would like to play my best this week.

 Q. What do you think it means to people at home if you play well here? What kind of lift does it give them? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I understand that people, especially in Sendai, they are living in hell, and I would love to show the energy and power of what golf can bring to those people. 

 Q. What's your first call going to be when you get in the clubhouse? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I have some friends in Tohoku area, so I hope I can contact them.

 Q. When are you going home? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: After this week, maybe Monday. 

 Q. Talk about the bracelet on your left hand and whether that has any significance with the earthquake or if it's something else. 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: No, it's not. This is a bracelet from the Japanese Cancer Society.

 Q. What has been the response from people to give -- a gesture to give your earnings this year? What have people said to you about that? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I think that many people were surprised, but I think they said, well, that's something that you can do. And I think that's probably the more likely style of supporting.

 Q. So you did find out about the earthquake today just now?
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Just now.
