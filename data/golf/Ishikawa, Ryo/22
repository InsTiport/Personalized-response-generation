   RYO ISHIKAWA: The International Team supports me a lot, so last night, Greg said to us, "We can do it tomorrow. So believe in yourself."   
 So I can do it tomorrow, I thought, so that's very great experience.   
  
  Q. Did you see any of the other leads that the international players had on the board as you were playing?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Not much. So on the 16th, I met Charl and Geoff, they also play good. So I greet them, yeah.   
  
  Q. To hear the roars around, is it a good feeling? Because you know it's the home crowd cheering, does that help you?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I'm just enjoying to be here and in front of the Australian people. So many nice guys. Very excited, yeah.   
  
  Q. Tell me what it felt like to get the first point for the team, you had to come out early and score a bunch of points to get back in and you were the first one to get a point.   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Yes, I just believe in myself. I want to say to the International Team members, just we can do it, so believe in yourself.   
  
  Q. The bunker shot you had, the first one, must have been a hard one?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: It was a very difficult shot. But I tried to make a bogey, so I made maybe five feet or six feet bogey putt. But I can do it, I thought, yeah.   
  
  Q. It looked like Bubba had the advantage there because he's left-handed; if he was right-handed, he would have had a tough shot, but being left-handed he hit a decent shot and had a good chance to make pay par.
