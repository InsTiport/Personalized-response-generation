 Q.   Just talk about your play this week, what you feel like you're doing well.   
RYOISHIKAWA:   I've played well these two months, like from‑‑ since Web.com finals.   I play three cut and make cut and three Top‑10s in a row.   
I feel more comfortable, much comfortable, more than like one year ago.   
   
 Q.   What changed?   You played well at the Web.com, played well last week.   
RYOISHIKAWA:   I don't know.   I just keep doing same thing on the range and the putting green.   I'm just working for my short game now and it's getting better.   So I'm very comfortable right now.  
   
 Q.   How much pressure did you feel in the Web.com playoffs?  
RYOISHIKAWA:   That was a pretty tough full tournament.   The players trying to get in the top 50, top 25.   That was tough, but I've played well.   
And then I got a little confidence for my game.   Especially one more Japanese guy, Hideki, he is not here now, but he gave me a lot of great energy.   He helps me a lot.   I'm very happy.  
   
 Q.   Just curious about your drive on 18.   
RYOISHIKAWA:   18?   Did you see that?   I had bad break through 17 today.   It's like a couple of eagle putts I missed.   I had played well, but it is just bad break.   But that end of today, it is like huge, huge break.   That was so lucky.   Yeah, I was very happy with the save, the save for par.  
   
 Q.   How do things feel different?   How do they change having another Japanese player on Tour with Hideki for the last two weeks?   
RYOISHIKAWA:   Yeah, I didn't surprise about Hideki's stats.   Last week, he's got great swing and great putter.   
   
 Q.   How does it change things for you?  
RYOISHIKAWA:   It's so much‑‑ he is a great player and at the same time is great guy.   We talk a lot for our golf and our game.   So it works pretty well.
