 Q. How was the match for you? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: We just couldn't get things going today. The American Team played really well. We just couldn't catch up. 

 Q. So the American Team was pretty tough? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: You have to accept the fact that they are good, but you still have to compete. 
 We have three more days, so I am going to do my best and hopefully on the final day be able to finish with a smile. 

 Q. What specifically were they good at? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: They hardly made any mistakes. They both played well. 

 Q. How did you feel on the first tee? Were you nervous? 
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I was really nervous, I felt like I was playing with Tiger at the British Open. But if you are in contention on the last hole, you will be more nervous so I would like to work hard and be in contention and be nervous on that last hole.
