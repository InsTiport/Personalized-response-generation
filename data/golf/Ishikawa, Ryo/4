Q.   Very nice start. 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Thank you. 

Q.   Tell me about your round. 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   First of all, I'm always honored to be playing this tournament.   I just got an invite, invitational, so that's always a lot of thanks to the Colonial people. 
And yeah, I'm just enjoying playing golf today, and that was a solid round, and I just played well around the greens.

Q.   And a bogey‑free around.
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah, that's why I talking about around the greens.   Yeah, I missed green maybe five or six, seven times.   A lot.   But I just, yeah, got up and down every time.   So that's why I should have no bogey today.

Q.   And finishing with two birdies in a row.   That's a great leap to go into tomorrow. 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah, that's was kind of lucky.

Q.   Lucky how?
RYO ISHIKAWA:   I mis‑hit on par‑3, 8, I hit a 6‑iron.   So I thought it wasn't going to go for the flat.   But it's like 10 feet, 10‑feet putt.   And I sunk that putt, and the final, the ninth, I just didn't expect it in the hole.   So...

Q.   How long was that putt?
RYO ISHIKAWA:   It was 35 feet, I think.

Q.   35 and breaking left?
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Breaking left, yeah.   Three feet.   Yeah.   So that was 2‑putt, 2‑putt par.   I'm happy.   I'm happy with that result, but I didn't expect that result.

Q.   Did the weather make the course more payable, do you think?
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah.   Obviously I got best tee time today, three hours almost (indiscernible).   We still got plenty of time to play 18 holes, and actually, we could have played 18 holes and finished.   I mean no rain, not too cold.   So that's the best time.

Q.   And nice not to have to wait till tomorrow to finish the round. 
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah.   Yes.   Hopefully, I don't think it's going to change tee time tomorrow.   Around 7 a.m., but I'm still happy to sleep and go to bed a little earlier. 

Q.   Good luck to you.   Thank you.
