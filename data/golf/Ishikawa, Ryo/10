 Q.   4‑under, 67 in Round 3, what happened out there?  
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah, I'm happy with that result.   Definitely different conditions with this wind, other direction.   And, yeah, since last Sunday at Augusta I've been playing well.   Hopefully, yeah, I get into the contention tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You had five 3's on the back nine, including a pretty spectacular birdie on 16.   Do you want to talk about that one?  
RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah, 130 yards to the flag with my 52 degree.   I was trying to right‑to‑left shot with about 30 yards and made it.   
   
 Q.   Your putting obviously is very good today.   What else is going really well?  
RYO ISHIKAWA:   I actually trying to do a change, something to putting.   About the setup.   I'm doing now (indiscernible) first and then take a backswing.   So it's more easier to get rhythm.
