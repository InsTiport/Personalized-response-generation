Q. Great round today.  If you could just some thoughts about how you played out there.RYO ISHIKAWA: When you look at the bunched up leaderboard, it's like 10 players within one stroke, so it's very tight scoring.  And obviously great course conditions and greens are so firm and fast, so that makes it a little more difficult, but I played solid today.Q. This being your first start, have you been close at all?  It's pretty amazing that it's the first time you've been here.  Have there been years where you've been right there on the edge?RYO ISHIKAWA: Nothing.  This is my first appearance in the tournament.  Yeah.  The first impression was everything is huge.  The driving range is huge and the chipping green are bigger than I thought, but 17th green was smaller than I thought, so that's a tough hole.  Yeah, I made three pars in a row these first three days, so hopefully I'm getting it down tomorrow as well.Q. Do you like having a bunched up leaderboard?  Can that make you focus a little bit more tomorrow?RYO ISHIKAWA: First 15 holes, it's going to be just do myself, do my best, hitting my shot, concentration for the shot.  So, you never know what's going to happen, so I just do my best the first 15 holes and then we'll see what's going on on the last three holes.Q. So you won't look at a leaderboard at all until 16?RYO ISHIKAWA: I have looked.  Yeah, I have looked at the leaderboards today.  And tomorrow, yeah, I'm looking, maybe, but I don't care about my position, maybe the first 10 or 12 holes, it doesn't matter, I think.  So maybe the last five or six holes it's a more important thing.
