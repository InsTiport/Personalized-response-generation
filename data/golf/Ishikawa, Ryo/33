  Q. Was it difficult today?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I'm sorry, I interpreted your question to mean about golf. Maybe you meant something else, but if you talk about golf --  
  
  Q. Both.   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: I started on 13. I had to hit with a long iron and it was a tough situation, but I was able to par save that hole and that got me going again.  
 If you can imagine, it's beyond being a distraction for me. I'm worried for the whole country of Japan. The fact that I was finally able to communicate with my parents did help me feel so much better. I just tried focus, but it is a battle out there for me.   
  
  Q. How far away do your parents live?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Well, as you can math, I object was out there on got could have source you probably have more information than I do. Sendai is quite far way from where my parents live; from the Tokyo area, it's some 250 miles away.   
 The magnitude of 5.0 felt where my family lives is still a very big earthquake. So I just hope that everybody else around will be safe, as well.   
  
  Q. How did you find out and when did you find out?  
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Very early this morning, because I have a habit of checking when I wake up in the morning, I get on my computer and check the Internet for news. And everywhere I saw was all about this, so I knew it early in the morning.  
  
  Q. How were you able to block that out and still play reasonably well today?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: It is not possible to block something of this magnitude out completely. But I understand that in the position that I am, together with the other star athletes from Japan and other sporting areas, we can provide encouragement and hope for the people of Japan by myself doing the job.
