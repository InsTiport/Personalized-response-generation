Q.   You've got to be happy with 4â€‘under?
    RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah.   The North Course is more easier than the other side.   So, yeah made four birdies.   So, yeah, I've done my goal today, so I'll focus on tomorrow.

Q.   You just bought a house in Carlsbad; is that correct? 
    RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah, we just bought.

Q.   Why this area? 
    RYO ISHIKAWA:   The Callaway Center and my house and maybe we can go there five minutes or ten minutes by car.   So it sounds good.   I play next week Phoenix, and then after that
    take off, and then back to home in Carlsbad and some practice on the Callaway Center.

Q.   I know you're trying to improve the way you play in America.   It hasn't gone quite the way you wanted so far. 
    RYO ISHIKAWA:   Yeah, I'd like to say the golf course is improved more than Japanese course.   So the golf course shape, and more longer distances are longer, and most players are driving longer than me, so it's more difficult place here.   But it's good for me.

Q.   I've talked to a lot of people that are following you today.   A lot of them are from Japan.   And they just said he's a rock star, and he's good looking.   He dresses well.   He's a big star.   What is life like when you go back there?   How are you treated? 
    RYO ISHIKAWA:   Oh, I don't think so.   But I can't separate (Indiscernible).   When I come to the golf course, it's nice.   I'm a professional, you know.   But if I am off the golf course, it's like normal people, so I don't separate.

Q.   But you're 21.   You come into this, and now you're a big celebrity back there.   What's a typical day like walking around out there? 
    RYO ISHIKAWA:   The more easier I can walk in town and we can go shopping.

Q.   You can't? 
    RYO ISHIKAWA:   Here, I can.   It's difficult in Japan.   So, it's more easier, yeah.
