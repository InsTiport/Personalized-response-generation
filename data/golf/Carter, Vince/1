  Q. So how did that course treat you today?
 VINCE CARTER:   It was okay.  Good shots, bad shots, inconsistent day.
 But it's fun regardless.  Being a Florida kid living here in Orlando for so long, wanting to have the opportunity to play here but obviously cannot because of my previous career for so long.
 So now that retirement is here I get the opportunity to be a part of it.  So regardless of the result, I'm glad to be here.  We'll worry about the results day two.  Day one I got like, Oh, finally I'm here, and we'll go from there.
 Q. How is retirement treating you?
 VINCE CARTER:   It's been great.  I can cut you off there.  Retirement has been great.  Fun.  More golf.  Some work.  A lot of golf.  And so I'm somewhat prepared, but nothing like playing tournament golf, getting the opportunity to be out here with a lot of my friends, peers, celebrities, professional golfers, and that's what it's all about.  And just to learn about yourself in a different sport.
 That's what it's all about.  It's fun.
 Q. Did you ever play in the Tahoe tournament?
 VINCE CARTER:   I did.  I played two years in that.  Yeah, I've been here before, but nothing -- like I said, nothing like playing at home here in Florida.  It's exciting.  Year one, day one, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
