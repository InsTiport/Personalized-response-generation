 Q.   (Inaudible)  
ANDREW MAGEE:   The Bob Gerbel family, that I met in 1982 when I came here for the Western Amateur, and I don't know how they dived up straws back then, but I was lucky enough to get those fine folks.   And when I got here on Monday, I met Bob, was out at the Point O Woods, I played in the pro‑am out there Monday morning and Bob was out there welcoming me back to town, 30 years later.   Amazing.   
And actually when I came up out here and checked in I had a note from his daughter, Nancy.   So Nancy asked me to stay with them too and they just so happened to live like right across the street, right here.   And mom wanted me to stay at their house and Nancy wanted me to stay at their house, because she's a better cook she thinks.   And they have more kids.   And I ended up with their family.   So that was fabulous.   
And I had a happy birthday right there.   David Frost put a nice bottle of wine in my locker.   And people have said how wonderful the golfers are out here on the Champions Tour and to a man, every single guy that I've known over all the years said, "Welcome to the Champions Tour" and it's really a nice feeling.   I'm probably the youngest guy in the entire field and probably every guy‑‑ I'd heard they're nice, I believe it.   
They're not so nice when they get out on the golf course and put the tee in the ground on the first tee box, but the guys have really been really polite and wonderful.
