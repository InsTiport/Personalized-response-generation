Q. Ten birdies on you today.  I don't know what else you could have done.
JOSH NICHOLS: That was a great tournament.  Yeah, not much I could have done.
Q. Talk about when you're in that type of situation where it's just this guy is making shot after shot.
JOSH NICHOLS: All I can play is my own game.  Just trying to make something happen.  I didn't have anything compared to what he did.
I didn't play that bad, but in his light, it was just -- looked like I played terrible.  He played amazing.
Q. He didn't give away too many holes.
JOSH NICHOLS: He won.  He made so any putts; he hit so many shots close.
Q. Did you try to change anything up from the morning round?
JOSH NICHOLS: Maybe tried to focus just a little bit more just to see if I could chop into the lead a little, and I wasn't even able to do that.  He just played phenomenally.
Q. What did you take from a week like this?  Missed the cut your first Mid-Am last year; get to final this year.
JOSH NICHOLS: Right.  I know.  I'll feel more comfortable next year.  Makes me want to get back even more.
It's more motivation.  It feels good.
Q. You'll have a few exemptions coming your way.  Obviously get into section qualifying for the Open; Amateur next year.  Don't know if you've ever played a U.S. Am.
JOSH NICHOLS: No, and it's at Pebble Beach.  I just learned that today during the match.  Yeah, that's awesome.
Q. Obviously next three Mid-Ams, too.
JOSH NICHOLS: Yeah.  Is that right?
Q. Yeah.
JOSH NICHOLS: Okay.  Sweet.  Next three?
Q. Yeah.  What do you learn from a week like this?  What do you think have to do to get where Matt is today?
JOSH NICHOLS: You know, that's a great question.  Just keep working on it when I can, when I've got time, and just keep enjoying the game.
The more I've enjoyed it the better I get.  The more I relaxed the better.
Q. Did you hear from somebody, from Scott Harvey overnight?
JOSH NICHOLS: Yeah, he texted me last night.  He said, If you need any advice reach out to me.  I said, Thank you, man.  I'm just going to go try to have fun.
But it was so nice to hear from someone that successful.
Q. Did you feel nerves today?
JOSH NICHOLS: Early on I did, but once he started mounting a lead I've got nothing to lose.
Q. You got back to all square early on.  Couple birdies on 3 and 4; holed out for a birdie on 9.
JOSH NICHOLS: Yeah.
Q. On the back nine just started...
JOSH NICHOLS: It's all I could do.  Even great golf couldn't keep up.  That's always tough.
