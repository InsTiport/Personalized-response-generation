Q. Just talk us through the match a little bit.
ROSE ZHANG:   Yeah, so overall I felt like I was playing the most solid I have in the previous two days.  My competitor, she was super -- she was actually hitting it really well.  On 1 she stuck it to like three feet and I had like a 30-footer that I drained just to tie the hole.  But that was kind of -- I just kept the momentum going in general, and it turned out to be a really smooth round for me.
Q. What do you like about match play?
ROSE ZHANG:   Yeah, I just like the fact that you can be aggressive and just -- since it's a one-on-one kind of thing, you don't really have to care about where your ball place is, you just go after it.  Just match play just makes me feel like -- it's really fun.  I just think it's really fun because you can be competitive, just trust yourself, go after your shots.  I think it's tough mentally, but at the same time I just love this kind of format.
Q. You've played this course a number of times now.  What have you learned that is going to help you the rest of the week?
ROSE ZHANG:   Yeah, I actually played -- the two practice rounds I only played nine because of my wrist.  But just overall like the greens are super tough.  You're going to have to place the ball extremely well.  The rough is quite thick, especially when it's raining, so you have to be careful on your drives.  Just in general, I think staying aggressive, but also having a strategy towards it, towards playing the course is super important.
But I love this course.  It's super nice, and I'm just looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. You're done a little early today.  What's kind of the plan the rest of the day?
ROSE ZHANG:   Just planning to go back to the hotel, rest a bit, eat some food.  Nothing really special.  Yeah, that's it.
