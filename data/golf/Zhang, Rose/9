Q. Obviously you knew it was going to be that type of -- you're playing the No. 1 seed and the way she's been playing.  Talk about the intensity of it and the fact that you went down two early and you got it back.
ROSE ZHANG: Overall she was just playing great golf.  I had to keep up with her in the beginning.  But overall, I tried out there.  I had a couple clutch putts that unfortunately I missed, but I think that's the game of golf.  I'm rooting for Yuka.  She's a great friend.
Q. You guys have obviously had little battles this summer, a couple weeks ago at the Girls' PGA.
ROSE ZHANG: Yeah, we played at Junior PGA and we also played at the ANA Junior Inspiration, so I know her quite well.
Q. Would you like to have the putt back on 17?
ROSE ZHANG: Yes, I would, because I made the second putt that I made.
Q. Was it just a little too bold on the --
ROSE ZHANG: No, it was just a little -- it was a slight misread on the first putt.  I didn't read enough.
Q. How about on 18?
ROSE ZHANG: Oh, on 18, well, I knew that I had to get it rolling, but she was in there closer than me, so you know, couldn't really do anything about that.
Q. Sum up your week.  You're obviously going to be headed to the Women's Am --
ROSE ZHANG: I'm not playing the Women's Am next week.  I'm playing the Pan-Am Games instead.  It's two girls, two guys.
Q. Where is that?
ROSE ZHANG: It's in Peru, so I'm looking forward to that.
Q. When do you leave for that?
ROSE ZHANG: I believe I'm leaving on the 5th.
Q. Of August?
ROSE ZHANG: Yes.  And then after that I have Swinging Skirts Invitational.
Q. Where is that?
ROSE ZHANG: That's up in Stanford, California.
Q. Who else is going with you to Pan-Am Games?
ROSE ZHANG: Emilia Migliaccio from Wake Forest.
Q. So she's not going to the Women's Am, either?
ROSE ZHANG: No, she's not.  And then Brandon Wu from Stanford and then Stewart Hagestad.
Q. So that probably had to be a tough decision?
ROSE ZHANG: Yes, it was.
