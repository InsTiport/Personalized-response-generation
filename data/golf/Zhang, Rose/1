THE MODERATOR:   How does it feel to be here at the U.S. Women's Open?  It's not your first time, but obviously still an amateur career that you're really proud of.
ROSE ZHANG:   Yeah, it's such a great memory to come here and play such a prestigious event, especially hosted by the USGA, but I'm just truly blessed to be able to play against the best in the world and just be able to compete with people that I watch on TV.
THE MODERATOR:   You've had an unbelievable year, Women's Am, low amateur at the ANA Inspiration.  How do you feel your game is right now and what are your expectations for the week?
ROSE ZHANG:   Yeah, I feel like golf is a very difficult sport and the USGA has really set up the course to make it extremely difficult this week, but I'm just really prepared to try to play the best that I can.
Obviously it's going to be a grind, but overall I'm just looking forward to a great week.
THE MODERATOR:   You've had a couple practice rounds out here.  What is your initial reaction to the courses?
ROSE ZHANG:   Yeah, my first initial reaction was it was a very long course.  Both courses are playing pretty long.  And you really have to know your way around the greens.  The greens are really wide and long, especially on Cypress Ridge.  But you just really have to ball strike really well on both courses.
THE MODERATOR:   Anything you're specifically looking forward to this week?  Have you played practice rounds with anyone or --
ROSE ZHANG:   Yes, I'm just really looking forward to playing in my group tomorrow with Nasa Hataoka and Celine Boutier.  I watch both of them on TV, and I'm just really excited.
