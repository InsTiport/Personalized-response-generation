  Q. When you came into this week, did you have any expectations, and what were they?
 ROSE ZHANG:   Yeah, I came in not having any expectations at all because after Rolex Girls I rested for two weeks because of my wrist, and coming into this week, I wasn't fully prepared as I usually would be.  Coming in, I didn't really have any expectations.
 Q. You got off to kind of a slow start but you kept your composure and rallied at the end.  What was the key to that rally?
 ROSE ZHANG:   Yeah, I finally found a little groove in my swing, and I was able to keep the momentum going.  When I was 4-over through 5, I didn't feel good with the ball.  My feel wasn't -- it was pretty tight because of nerves, I guess, and overall, I just tried to stay in the moment and hit shot after shot.
