Q. Talk a little bit about your play this week overall.
MIKE McCOY: Well, it was pretty good.  I putted pretty well all week.  Today I was a little -- this afternoon I was a little tentative with the putter, although I don't quite understand why.  You know, it was a good week.  I played well.  I made a lot of birdies and hit a lot of good shots when I needed to.  Sean played great, and that's the way the chips fall.
Q. Three of the four of you here in the semifinals are USGA champions.  Just talk a little bit about the strength of the field of this event.
MIKE McCOY: Pretty strong, yeah.  I mean, it was kind of a -- just all the same guys you've been battling your whole career.  Here they still are.  Everybody says, well, the senior golf is going to get easy.  Well, it doesn't get any easier.
Q. Obviously you'll be back next year.  Talk about kind of the future for you in this event.
MIKE McCOY: Yeah, I'm going to keep playing, trying to play all of them.  It's the best way to kind of end the season, too.  It comes late in the year, and it keeps you grinding through the summer.
