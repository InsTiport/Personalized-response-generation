Q. He got out of the gate pretty quickly and that must be tough to come back from?
MIKE McCOY: ?I hit a couple of loose tees shots and I was just a little out of rhythm. The greens look so flat but they do have movement in them and I just seemed to mis-read them. He played beautiful golf. He just didn?t give me any openings. When there was an opening I just didn?t make the putts. He made a short day of it.
