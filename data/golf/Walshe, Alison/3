Q.   Tough scoring day out there today? 
ALISON WALSHE:   Yeah, especially the front nine, just because it was kind of annoying with the weather.   But yeah, it was pretty tough to get close and make some birdies.

Q.   You hung in there, though, you're one of six players under par right now.   What was clicking? 
ALISON WALSHE:   I think just being patient.   I got a birdie‑‑ you know, I was 1‑under on the front nine, which I thought was real good, because the weather was bad on my front nine.   
             So it was just kind of maintaining patience because I knew it was going to get windy and stuff.   I didn't hit anything great but I didn't hit anything bad.

Q.   How nice is it to keep the good playing going?   You're been playing phenomenal lately. 
ALISON WALSHE:   No, it's good.   I think it's just a mind‑set.   You start playing well and you're just confident and stuff.   So it's been kind of nice to just keep it going and hopefully I can continue.

Q.   What's your plan the rest of the year? 
ALISON WALSHE:   I am going to head home after this and take a good three weeks before CME.   I'm taking off Japan and MÃ©xico, and I'm just going to get ready for CME and enjoy the off‑season.

Q.   Are you going to see your Red Sox play?
ALISON WALSHE:   I hope.   I'm itching to get inside and see what the score is.   Do you have any clue?   Did they win? 

Q.   I think they did, yeah. 
ALISON WALSHE:   Yeah, I'm hopefully going to try to score a game.

Q.   Have you been able to watch it at all since you've been over here?
ALISON WALSHE:   It's actually been nice, because like in the morning sometimes, down in Korea, I got to watch it in the morning kind of pre‑tournament and then they replay it every afternoon, so it's kind of nice, yeah.
