Q.   We're here with Alison Walshe.   Congratulations, a great round of 6â€‘under 66 today.   Can you take me through the day and what was working well for you out there? 
ALISON WALSHE:   Yeah, I was hitting the ball really well off the tee, which gave me a lot of opportunities to attack the pins.   My putter was really working well today.   I made a few long ones, which always helps, and then I converted on the short ones, so everything came together.

Q.   Everyone's been talking about this course, and how tight it plays and how accurate you have to be with your irons.   What are the keys to succeeding on this course? 
ALISON WALSHE:   Just good targets.   The greens are soft, so if you have a really good target, the greens are small and tight.   But I've really focused on targets, not necessarily attacking pins, and it's just kind of kept me out of trouble.

Q.   What was the biggest difference today for you compared to the round yesterday? 
ALISON WALSHE:   I'd say my irons.   Yesterday I struggled a bit and left myself with longer length putts.   But today I was closer and my putts became easier.

Q.   How have you been feeling about your game overall coming into this week?   Did you see a round like this coming up for you?
ALISON WALSHE:   Yeah, I've been playing well.   Last week I missed the cut but it's been a matter of putting.   I've been hitting it good, and it's just a matter of when, and hopefully it continues this weekend.

Q.   Everybody talks about gearing up in the season, and now a few events under your belt.   Feeling good about how the game's progressing and how you're heading into the rest of the season? 
ALISON WALSHE:   Yeah, totally.   This is my first year coming back to the same events, so I'm definitely more comfortable.   My game's more comfortable going back to the same track.   So I'm excited for the year.
