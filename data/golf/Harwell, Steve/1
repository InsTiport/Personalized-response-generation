Q. Your impressions of today's match.
STEVE HARWELL: I just putted awful. I mean, I hit it really good and I just missed some putts; didn't judge my long putts very good. You know, the type of player Rick is you can't give him holes.
Then I made a valiant effort trying to come back there at the end making birdie. I thought the one on 17 was in, too. Went right over the lip.
But you just can't give him that big of a lead. It was just all putting.
Q. You knew what you were in for. You've met each other on a regular basis in the past.
STEVE HARWELL: Oh, yeah, yeah. He used to live in North Carolina, South Carolina, so we've played a lot against each other. So he's just a good, solid player. Doesn't make too many mistakes.
I mean, he didn't play as well on the front and I had my chances. You know, with all the missed putts, just, you know, it was just very disappointing.
Q. What do you take away from the whole week here having made the quarterfinals? I know it's not the ultimate that you wanted, but getting this far...
STEVE HARWELL: Yeah, no, I mean, to make the quarterfinals, it's a great honor. I've had a great year. Wanted to go a little further, but it's definitely an honor just to play in the USGA championships.
