 Q. Overall you must be very happy?
 TANO GOYA: Yeah, I played great all day. So I mean, it was a bad shot with the driver. That wasn't playable. Bogey was not that bad. Still happy and I'm very happy because I'm playing with Manuel de los Santos, so I'm very happy playing with him. He's a great guy and we are having fun. So that's important. You know, it's not only playing good, but we are playing with amateurs and playing good in teams, as well.
 Tomorrow playing in Carnoustie, so everything can happen and still have two days more to work and see what happens.

 Q. Are you enjoying it? Nice weather in Scotland?
 TANO GOYA: The last few years I've played this tournament, it's ugly weather but this year it's unbelievable, so I'm enjoying it very much.
