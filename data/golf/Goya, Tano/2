  Q. Good score around here, isn't it?  
 TANO GOYA: It was perfect, we didn't have rain everything was perfect, and I had a good finish.   
  
  Q. You must have been looking at the clock and the skies over the last couple of holes?  
 TANO GOYA: Yeah, to be honest, I didn't think we were going to finish, because, you know, I thought we were going to finish maybe 16 holes or something like that. But at the end we finished and that's important because you know tomorrow I can rest a little bit more, and we are going to start more fresh you know. So now I'm going to have a good dinner.  
  
  Q. And this is good as well to continue the form from last week, because you're up there, competitive?  
 TANO GOYA: I feel good. Last week I played amazingly. I finished a couple of bogeys at the end but still a Top-10 and I feel confident and you know I can still play good. The week is long, so it's been a long rode to go.   
  
  Q. Is it fair to say you haven't done that much this season, you haven't put two good tournaments together.   
 TANO GOYA: I've been working a lot, and, you know, I think things are going -- it's starting to go together. So the year is long and I still have a lot of tournaments to play and hopefully I can get in The Race to Dubai. That's my goal this year.
