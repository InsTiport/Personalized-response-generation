   ANDREW McLARDY: My timing was good, and I got a new driver, and it's the first round of golf with my new irons.   
  
  Q. And they are doing their job.   
 ANDREW McLARDY: Yeah, they were good. They gave me good flight.  
  
  Q. What made you change, or when did you change? I know this is the first round.   
 ANDREW McLARDY: Just wanted a higher flight, which is good for this course.  
  
  Q. I take it you haven't been satisfied with the way the game has been in recent weeks and maybe months?   
 ANDREW McLARDY: No, it hasn't been great.   
 It's been cold and wet and I've been doing a lot of travelling, so maybe today will change with the good weather, and being on quick bentgrass, felt like home.   
  
  Q. New clubs in the bag, new confidence?  
 ANDREW McLARDY: Yeah, I needed a good round, and because I need a good finish at Valderrama so I'm in position for that.   
  
  Q. Do you use that as an inventive and as a target, a particular focus?   
 ANDREW McLARDY: You want to make the top 60, and it's the last Valderrama event and of the season. It's motivation, but I was quite carefree today and freed it up and tried to just have a good time.  
  
  Q. Is there any particular reason why things haven't worked out in recent months? Earlier on in the season, you had your opportunities.   
 ANDREW McLARDY: It was a good start. I'm not sure what it was, just little things happening with my swing and you find it again and you play something that looks like golf again.
