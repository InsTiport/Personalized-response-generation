Q. Just take us through 9 there, your last hole.
KELLY SHON: Well, I think just having a good round, hitting the ball fine, and we had to kind of -- the fairways are getting a little bit firmer later in the day, so we had to adjust our game plan, and I hit my 3-wood off the tee, got lucky and got out to the fairway and then I hit a nice 8-iron.  All of my practice round here I haven't been able to hit the green, so I was just trying to get it on the green, and I did, and I hit a nice 20-something-footer down the hill, and good thing the hole got in the way.  It was going at a pretty good speed.
Q. Got to feel good to be towards the top in contention going into round 2.  How are you feeling after this first round?
KELLY SHON: Well, I'm happy because I hit the ball well, and mentally I was in a good place and I putted the ball well.  I think if I do the same thing the next three days -- you know, it's still early.  To say that you're in contention after the first round is not much, but I am happy about my round and how I played today.
