Q.   How do you feel about your position going into tomorrow? 
KELLY SHON:   I don't know my position.

Q.   I think you're two off. 
KELLY SHON:   I'm minus 9.

Q.   Well, you're one off the lead.   Gerina is at minus 10, and then there's four or five at minus 9 and a bunch at minus 8.   How do you like that spot?
KELLY SHON:   It's cool.   I don't know, I haven't really thought about it, just trying to play golf and have fun out there.   I'm learning a lot.   I think that's the most important thing right now for me. 

Q.   How will you approach tomorrow? 
KELLY SHON:   Well, I have 26 holes left, so it's going to be another long day, so just try to stay patient and do exactly what I've been doing. 

Q.   What kind of feedback are you getting?   Are there a lot of people rooting you on?
KELLY SHON:   You mean from here or from outside the bubble? 

Q.   Both, I guess. 
KELLY SHON:   Yeah, I'm a little bit even, I think, separated, distanced from it because I'm not having my cell phone connections.   I'm sure it would be blowing up a little bit more so.   I'm not even active on Twitter yet.   I think a lot of people have been telling me that I'm coming out as an amateur, and also from South Korea, but I'm of U.S. citizenship and also a pro.   I think it's just coming up on TV that way.
