  Q. Can you take away a positive today?
 SEBASTIAN MUNOZ:   Totally, I played really good, every day I'm feeling better.  Since like, not a rough start, but not great start of the season, you know, 2021, but every day feeling a little bit better.  And it's a tough course, it penalizes when you make mistakes on everyone.
 Q. Do you find it a course that penalizes you at any moment but also gives you more chances for a course that's penalizing?
 SEBASTIAN MUNOZ:   Yeah, you do have a lot of wedges in your hand, your par-5s are reachable, so, yeah we do have a lot more chances than a usual course, but yeah I mean danger is around the corner on every hole.
