 Q. (Inaudible)?   
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, that's the idea. Just come out here and just trying to do my best on every hole, and that's it.  
   
 Q. As people start losing energy, because it's been long days here, how do you keep up your physical and mental energy?   
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: I really haven't done much. I haven't worked out this week. My trainer's not here with me this week, so I skipped a couple workouts. I'm not very proud of that, I guess, but not doing anything different. Just havingââ I'm staying with my caddie and my coach. We just talk at night, play video games, and just doing the same thing.  
   
 Q. And that will help you mentally?   
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: I think so. I'm still pretty young in my career, so I don't find it draining.
