Q. How did it go for you out there today?
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ: It was great. I mean, every drive was good. I hit a lot of good putts that went in. Saw my line pretty clearly today and just executed.
Q. 16 of greens. How huge was ball striking?
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ: Huge. You can get a pretty gnarly lie up here. Bermuda is not that friendly. So I just found myself a lot of looks, birdies chances, and it was good.
Q. Tomorrow in the final round what momentum are you carrying?
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ: You know, shooting 64 is pretty good. Hitting the ball great and the putting really good, so...
Q. What is your mindset going into the weekend with probably the lead?
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ: You know, just be in the moment, be present, you know, be thankful for what happened today and just that I'm going to have a great opportunity for tomorrow. You know, just one shot at a time.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ: Feels great. I mean, on No. 1 I had (indiscernible) and had a good bounce on the green. Hit my putt, made it, and then stick it on No. 2 and 3.
So, I mean, just great momentum. You realize all the good that has happened so you keep going.
Q. (Regarding the relationship with Carlos.)
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ: Yeah, I mean, really good friends. I mean, we don't talk to each other all day, but it's great.
