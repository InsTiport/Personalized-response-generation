 Q.  How does it feel to qualify to play in your first Open Championship?  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, I was just walking off finishing 18 and I was pretty let down, except my caddie told me, hey, man we're in the Open Championship.  And I said, all right, I completely forgot about it.  And I just -- I mean, I'm happy, I'm excited.  The first Major, I would never have thought it was going to be The Open Championship.  So it's awesome.   
 Q.  Have you ever played links golf before?  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Never.  I've only been in Italy in Europe.  So -- and I think I might have played one or two links courses ever, so it should be quite a different experience.   
 Q.  What is your sort of memories of the Open Championship?  Did you watch it on TV growing up?  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, of course I did.  I've been watching golf since I was a little kid.  I just hope it's not as breezy as it always is, because I'm more of a high ball player, but it will be a great experience, so we'll see.   
 Q.  I think you're the only Columbian in the field so far.  How good is that to represent your country?  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: It's awesome.  It gets Columbia closer to where it was and where it wants to be and it's an honor to represent my country abroad.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, that was totally the difference, I just, I never found a rhythm with it.  I was taking it back too quick and I realized that on the final few holes.  I wasn't swinging good enough to make a difference.   
 Q.  You've come so close now and you keep knocking on the door, you'll bang it down one time.  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, that's what it's all about, it's about getting better, about keeping building, getting experiences.  It is my first year, first time being in a tournament on the back nine, so just take it as an experience, positive, and move on for the next one.   
 Q.  I haven't seen your FedExCup standings, but this is going to help you make a run at the top 125.  How great is that?  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, it's great.  I needed to make a move, I was staying back and I was like 198, I think, so this is going to definitely help.  I just have to bring it home the last, in the last four or five events.   
 Q.  You obviously have next week and then The Open Championship, so you have two events to make that up.  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, you're right.   
 Q.  Was it a little bit of disbelief at the end of the front nine when you missed those short putts?  What were you thinking at that point?  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, I just think the putt on 4, that short one, I just stepped out of my routine and I missed it and it shook up things for me.  That was the one thing that, if I could have changed, I would have.  But, yeah, I was just trying to find it on the next five or six holes and, yeah, it just created that little lack of confidence or doubt, that created a little doubt and it didn't help.   
 Q.  Did you see Xander's shot?  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, we were right there.  I knew I needed to make my putt and it was just kind of like a triple breaker.  I mean, it sounds weird, because we don't have a lot of those, but that's what it was.  So I was just pleased to have a chance.   
 Q.  Coming back from the flood a year ago and putting on this tournament.  Talk about that.  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, it's fantastic.  The tournament has done a great job, the people in charge of the course, they did a fantastic job.  The course was pristine, the greens were awesome, they were really hard, but they did a heck of a job.  I just really want to congratulate them for putting all that effort and time into it.  It really paid off.   
 Q.  Are you going to beat yourself up over this or are you kind of looking at it as, oh, well?  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: No, there's no benefit.  I'm sure I'm going to go back and analyze what went wrong at what point.  It's just a positive experience, it's my best finish ever, so it's not like I can be mad about it.   
 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: It's going to be like five minutes.  It's going to be fun.   
 Q.  The flag in your hand is important, too.  
SEBASTIAN MUNOZ: Yeah, sure.  I wasn't expecting it.  I would never have suspected The Open Championship was going to be the first one, so there you go.
