Q. You start off the round with seven birdies in a row.  First off what got you going so quickly, and what's your mind-set as you're just making birdie after birdie?
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ:   Something clicked yesterday during my practice round with my putting and just kind of freed my mind.  I don't have to think so much about technique anymore about speed.  So on the first hole I made a good like 15-footer left-to-right.  Hideki and Kevin stuffed it pretty close from farther from me, so it was nice to get it.
And then, you know, 2-putted 2.  On 3, hit a nice shot and made a good putt.  It just kind of kept going and when I made five in a row, I'm like, well, we're here now, so we just keep pressing.  We made birdie, hit it really close on 6.  And 7, the par 5, I hit driver, driver and had the putter in my hand.  It just happened.  I hit in the right spots and I got the good breaks.
Q. After you make seven birdies in a row, does it change your thought process at all, and after that, you only make one more birdie coming in.  Is there a little bit of a disappointment in that?
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ:   No, not really a disappointment.  You know, it's golf.  Sometimes you misread the putt, you miss the putt and it goes in; and sometimes you actually read the putt correctly, hit the putt perfect and it just skips to the right; and it's just golf you have to understand that.  I felt like I got the good breaks the start and played pretty solid on the back nine and made one birdie and lipped-out a couple and misread a couple.  I felt pretty good with my game and I'm just happy.
Q. What's the most birdies you've made in a row?
SEBASTIÁN MUÑOZ:   Eight in the PGA TOUR Latin America in the final round somewhere in Ecuador.
