 Q. Can you walk us through your unusual first round in Augusta?   
SEBASTIAN MUÃOZ: It was pretty good. I had a good start, birdieing 12, 13 and 14, made a couple dumb mistakes, hit it in the water on 15, threeâputted on 8. But overall it was pretty good. You definitely learned a couple things here and there, but I feel happy.   
   
 Q. Do you think the different conditions helped you, not having a lot of patrons?   
SEBASTIAN MUÃOZ: I don't know. I think what did help me was that the greens are soft and they spin, so I got into a lot of spots that I could spin the ball pretty good and get upâandâdown easy, so I think that definitely helped.
