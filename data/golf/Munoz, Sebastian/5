 Q. How would you sum up your round?   
SEBASTIAN MUÃOZ: Yeah, I finished round 1 this morning not feeling very good with my iron play, driver play, so I went to the range, and I kind of got a feel that really helped me out there. I started pretty good with birdieing the first two, then I gave them back, then I got them again at the end of 8 and 9. It was good. I felt like I hit the ball pretty good. I stroked it nice, and I took advantage of the parâ5s.   
   
 Q. I assume you got some advice for your first time at the Masters.   
SEBASTIAN MUÃOZ: I mean, I did play with OlazÃ¡bal and Vijay, and they kind of gave me pointers here and there, but overall, they just said, man, it's completely different from what we're used to. So I think that kind of helped me because I didn't try to play it the way it usually plays and just the way I perceive it right now, so I think that's the biggest thing I've taken away so far.   
   
 Q. Is there something or some person that motivates you in situations like this, in majors?   
SEBASTIAN MUÃOZ: No, I'm just trying to do my best. Like me and my team just are trying to get the experience and trying to do every time a little bit better.
