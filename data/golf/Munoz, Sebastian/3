  Q. Really nice round of golf today, including that 28-footer you just made at 9 to close out at 4-under par.  Your thoughts on how well you played today?
 SEBASTIAN MUNOZ:   I played great golf.  Yesterday I wasn't hitting the ball that good and my coach was over here, we didn't really find anything, and just the change of day, a change of rhythm a little bit and I stroked it very nice today.  Really pleased with the way I hit the ball and it was so nice to go away with that 3 at the end.
 Q. You played here last year for the first time in this event, what did you learn about that experience that's going to help you this week?
 SEBASTIAN MUNOZ:   Oh, man, that it plays really tough.  Last year it was carnage.  This year I just came here with, like expecting that.  But the greens are a little softer, the rough's a little shorter, so I just took advantage of it.
 Q. What did you think of the course conditions today, because Rory had the low number in the morning, Corey's come out here, played pretty well this afternoon, but there's not a lot of those scores out there.  It played pretty tough.
 SEBASTIAN MUNOZ:   Yeah, I feel like, I mean, the course is awesome.  The rough's penalizing, chipping is not easy and the greens, you got to start your putts on line.  So I just think that I rode the momentum all day, I hit the shots where I needed to be, take some good pars here and there and just finished strong.
