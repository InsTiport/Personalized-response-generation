 Q. How did it go out there today?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: It was a bit of a struggle today. I really needed to fight out there. I didn't really find my swing the whole round, and I struggled to hit the good shots. I had a few of them, and I made a few birdies, which was nice, but yeah, it was a tough day. But yeah, 3‑under is good. Yeah, I'm happy about it‑‑ I'm happy about the way I kept fighting and working on my things, yeah. It was just that double‑bogey on 17 was really frustrating. But yeah, that happens.  
   
 Q. How did you make that?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Didn't really commit to my tee shot and hit it like right short in the bunker, and then it plugged. Couldn't really do much. Tried to hit it on the green. Got a little bit long, and yeah, 3‑putted from there.  
   
 Q. But other than that, your putting must have been very good today?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Yeah, I was putting very well today. I only hit I think one bad putt. So yeah, that was really nice, and gave me a lot of confidence going into the next two days.  
   
 Q. What is your thoughts now, going for the medal?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Sure. I've always‑‑  
 Q.You've always felt confident about it?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Well, not confident. I know that I have to play well. But I mean, yeah, I'm definitely going for the medal, absolutely.  
   
 Q. And how are you enjoying the experience in the athlete's village?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: It's cool. It's nice to be surrounded by athletes. I think we have a good atmosphere in the Danish, yeah, all the Danish people together. Everybody is cheering for each other. It's really cool getting back there yesterday and a lot of people is like, good luck, and well played. It's just nice to get their support, as well.  
   
 Q. Have you met any of your heros?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Maybe not heros. But like the Danish handball team, the men, I think they are pretty cool. At the Danish reception, I think it was, what, Saturday, I sat next to two of them, which was pretty cool, yeah.   
So it's a good experience so far.
