 Q.  Hole-in-one on 8.  Talk me through it and how everything developed.  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Well, got to the tee.  It was 124 meters, which will be is 136 yards-ish.   
Yeah, it was good club.  It was my 9-iron.  I knew that, I mean, it would be probably a little bit long, but there is this backstop behind the pin, and I played it on the backstop had a good line in and it went in.   
 Q.  Just came right back to the hole?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Yeah, it did.  It looked like it was like stopping very close, and then it kind of falled in, so that was pretty cool.   
 Q.  Do you know how many hole-in-ones you've had?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: I had four.   
 Q.  In competition?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Three in competition and then one in practice.  I actually had one last year on the Symetra Tour, too.   
 Q.  So that was your last one since last year.  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Yeah, that was in April, too, so I guess April is just a good month.   
 Q.  Pretty good way to start your morning.  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Yeah, started out with a birdie, par on 7, then hole-in-one, and then a good par on 9.   
So, yeah, very good morning.
