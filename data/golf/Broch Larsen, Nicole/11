 Q.  5-under par today.  What was the key to your round?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: I mean, I didn't really hit the ball as well as like last week, as I wanted.   
Things just kind of went my way.  I had like three, four shots that were really close.  Had a few good par saves.   
So I just kind of stayed patient; things happened.  Yeah, and then I was 5-under.   
 Q.  Eagle on 5.  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Yeah.  Hit a good drive and 4-iron to about a meter in and made that one.   
Yeah, I mean, started out with birdie and got that eagle and had a few, what, three bogeys out there, few bad drives.   
Then, yeah, two fairway bunkers.  Yeah, overall pretty steady.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you're riding the momentum from last week a little bit?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: It's a new week so everything can happen.  Yeah, definitely gave me a big boost, that top 3 finish, especially birdie/birdie finish.   
I have my coach here in the practice days.  He's leaving tomorrow.  Been really nice having him here and kind of continue the work we started in my two off weeks.  Yeah, I'm just trying to do my things and try and, yeah, work hard.   
 Q.  It's your first time playing this course this week.  How does it set up for you?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: Quite good I think.  I think it's definitely a good thing to hit it long from the tee, even though there are some short holes, too.   
On the driving holes you can really get advantage; on the par-5s, too.  I was a meter short on, what is that, 12 or 13, but apart from that, I had irons into the par-5s.   
So, yeah, it's good for me.  Yeah, I like it.
