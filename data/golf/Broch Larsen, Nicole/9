 Q.  67, matching your low round of the year so far.  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: I mean, I was putting quite well.  I was just really good at sticking to my process.  Yeah, keep doing what I kind of planned with my coaches this morning.   
 Q.  Remarkably this is also just your first time playing here.  What was your plan when you came out to get familiar with the course?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: I mean, we had some good practice rounds.  We had our putting coach around.  We talked a lot about like the greens, because these greens are really tough like if you don't put yourself in the good spots.   
So we talked a lot about that.  Yeah, feel like I just stick to the plan today and it worked out well.   
 Q.  This is just your second season out here on the LPGA Tour.  What do you feel like you learned last year that's helping you this season?  
NICOLE BROCH LARSEN: That you definitely got to be patient.  Like it's four rounds and everything can happen.  Even though you only make the cut, still two rounds to go.   
Everybody out here is so good, so it's not far from just making the cut to the leaders in a normal week.  Just got to be patient.   
Yeah, I had one week I was playing in the last group in Canada, and definitely helped like gain a lot of experience.   
Yeah, just trying to enjoy it out here.
