Q.  You must be very happy with your first round.
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Yeah, very happy.  I played good and saved a couple of times and that's what you need to do.  I'm happy.
Q.  It's an extremely course.  What were the most difficult as expects of it?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Oh, definitely the tee shots because you have bunkers everywhere and the rough is very tough.

So you need to hit the fairways, or at least close to it, and miss the bunkers.
Q.  And what was it that you did that you felt got you through it, and at 3 under, as well?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Well, I missed the bunkers.  I had a couple of awkward lies in the rough, but still came out pretty good and saved it with some good chips.
Q.  Do you generally play well in these conditions?  Does this type of weather suit you or this course?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Yeah, pretty good, actually.  Yeah, I like it.
Q.  And with the weather getting worse this afternoon, you must be pleased your in the clubhouse with a 69 rather than starting the round now.
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Yeah, definitely.  I'm just waiting for the rain.  Haven't seen it yet but we'll see.
Q.  How does this rank, this season in terms of your round?  Would you say it's one of your better 18 holes?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Yeah, definitely the first round here, and on such a difficult course.  Yeah, I'm very pleased.
Q.  And plan for tomorrow, just kind of consolidate and build and get yourself in position for the weekend so that you can contend?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Yeah, definitely, something like that would be perfect.
Q.  You played here in Portmarnock a few years ago?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Exactly.
Q.  What year was that?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  I think it was '97.  I turned pro straight after that tournament.
Q.  Which event did you play?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  That was European Championship.
Q.  A few years ago the same name, Mathias Gronberg at The K Club won in similar conditions.  Do you remember that one?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Yeah, he won by ten shots or something.  Must have played pretty good.
Q.  Same sort of conditions.  So do you play in similar conditions at home in Sweden?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Sometimes, not as often as you guys get it here, but a few times, yeah.  But this course is much better than the courses, most of them, that we have at home in Sweden.
Q.  You're impressed by the layout?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Yeah, definitely.  And the greens were superb.
Q.  How about your own season and your own career, what do you see next for you?  How are your plans going?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  This year I was trying to get my card as soon as possible this year.  Started off pretty good but now the last five tournaments here I haven't played really good.  But hope this is the turning point.
Q.  You played very well in the northwest of Ireland as well, very difficult condition again.
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Yeah, that's right.  It might suit me then.
Q.  What do you do when you see bad weather?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Well, we expected it because it was even worse yesterday.  It was playing a little bit easier today though because they moved up a few tees, but still, it's a tough course.  You have to miss in the right places.
Q.  What would you be hoping for, your performance?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Well, in the Top 10 I would be very happy definitely.  It's a good field.
Q.  Are you playing the next few weeks?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  Well, I don't think I'm getting into next week because I'm like eighth or ninth reserve right now, and not many people are going to withdraw from that one.
Q.  What were birdies?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  On the first par 5, the fifth, drive, 3 wood, 2 putted.  And the next one, I eagled 13, the short par 4.  I hit a drive there and holed the putt from five meters.
Q.  Then from there it's a very tough run.
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  It is.  I birdied 15, the par 5, knocked it on in two and 2 putted there, too.  3 putted 17 for a bogey.
Q.  How far was the 2 putt?
MATTIAS ELIASSON:  It was from 16, 17 meters.
