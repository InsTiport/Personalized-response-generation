Q.   Good day for you?
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Outstanding, great day.

Q.   How has the tournament been? 
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Awesome.   Everything I've dreamed of, playing in these big events, in front of big crowds and contending.   I was just stoked.

Q.   And mentally, how did you handle all of that? 
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Not too bad, actually.   I think just the mind frame I came in with, like all day out there, no one expected anything of me.   Sort of just crept along, going all right on the back nine.   I had no pressure on me, there's no expectations and so I knew myself, I could probably get close and I was happy that I proved it to myself. 

Q.   Is that the attitude that young players have to take when they are playing in big events like this do you think? 
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Yeah, I think so.   Well, sort of worked for me today, but just got to try to not get too overwhelmed and realise, you're just there doing what you've always been wanting to do.   I've been running through these moments like all my life, every single day.   So today was just like, I was just living the dream pretty much. 

Q.   You played with Bo, how was that?
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   That was awesome.   He's a really nice guy.   Him and SÃ¸ren are obviously both awesome players.   Yeah, that was another reason why I just still thought, you know, there was nearly less pressure playing with those guys because really they are far better players than me.   So I just go out there and do my best and see what happens.

Q.   Small events, does that help your state of mind when you find yourself in this situation?
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Yeah, I know it's small pressure and all that, but I've put the same pressure on myself every week trying to win whenever I'm playing any tournament, so I think this week, you know, just going to be a lot of bigger awards and bigger crowds and all that.   The pressure, it's just the same I think, just a normal tournament when you go out and try to win it.

Q.   So when do you do for the rest of the summer and what do you have in mind for next year?
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Well, I'm a bit better than what I thought I was.   So be able to just try to, got a couple big events coming to finish off the year, Aussie Open and all that.   So I'm just looking forward to that and trying to play well and hope I can keep up the good form.

Q.   Where do you plan to play next year?
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Next year, I was planning on just going to Asian Q‑School at the start of next year.   Just try and start off there and work my way through try and get through to Europe, just one step at a time sort of thing.

Q.   You have a bit of spending money for that, investment money. 
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Yeah, got to pay off a lot of things.   My parents and I, especially my parents, put a lot of time and effort into it.   Like my dad will say, probably not even square yet.

Q.   How did you find the course? 
DIMITRIOS PAPADATOS:   Awesome.   The course is unreal, great condition.   It was really good.   Held the crowds nicely.   So, yeah, I enjoyed it.   The greens are pure.
