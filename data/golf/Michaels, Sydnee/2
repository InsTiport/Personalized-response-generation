SYDNEE MICHAELS: The greens got a little more firm, some of them were a little more shaggy as the day went on.  Yeah, I'm really pleased with 3-under today in the afternoon.   
 Q.  Did you have to put more grind in the gear to get it done today?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: Me and my caddie really just stuck to our game plan and really didn't falter from that.  And a couple of times when I needed to get up and down, if I hit it on the green and it went far, I made the up and down.  So it was a grind.  It was a grind today.   
 Q.  And in a nutshell the game plan, is that just to hit fairways and take advantage of when you're in the fairway and go for it?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: Definitely.  There's some holes out here that are a par hole, don't do anything silly and just play smart.  There's a lot of birdies out here, as well.  So it's just kind of picking and choosing how aggressive you want to play, depending on the hole, where the pin is, et cetera.   
 Q.  You've had some success in certain rounds at the Women's Open?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: Yeah, I think I finished top-20 last year.  So, yeah, I love this tournament.  This is the best.   
 Q.  What did you take from last year with a good finish?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: It's confidence.  I think anytime you play well in a major, it's just experience every time.  So I definitely took from that and we'll hopefully continue with good vibes for the rest of the week.
