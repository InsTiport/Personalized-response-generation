Q.   Awesome round out there.   You're actually co‑leading with Juli Inkster and Cristie Kerr.   What was working for you out there?
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   I just hit a lot of good shots, and I made a few good putts in the beginning.   I just felt really confident today.

Q.   Now, I notice that you only had 24 putts for your round.   Was your putter on fire or was it just getting to the green that was really working?
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   My goal today was just to hit greens, and then I made some good putts.   I missed a couple short birdie opportunities, but I also made‑‑ I putted solid today, yeah.

Q.   I know it was wet earlier in the week, the course, but is it starting to dry out in the afternoon wave?
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   Definitely, yeah, it's definitely starting to dry out, so I think for sure by tomorrow and this weekend, it's going to be in good shape.

Q.   Did you have to alter your game and your strategy on the greens towards the end of your round?
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   Yeah, I think I saw like some of the‑‑ it was releasing a little more, so yeah, we had to add a few more yards for roll, so definitely.   We kind of had to change strategy, yes.

Q.   It's a pretty crowded leaderboard between 5 under and 4 under.   What's the strategy tomorrow and then obviously throughout the weekend?
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   I'm just going to do the same thing I did today, just hit greens.   That's going to be my goal for the week.   Hopefully the putts go in. 

Q.   How does it feel to kind of be up there with Hall of Famer Juli Inkster and Cristie Kerr who just won Kia this year, as well?
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   No, it's great.   Juli, it's so awesome that she's still competitive, and it's very cool.
