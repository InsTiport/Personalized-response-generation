  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Sydnee Michaels into the interview room.   Awesome round, 6‑under today.   Talk about your round.   Five birdies on the back nine.   
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   Yeah, I mean, I definitely got on a roll.   I gave myself good birdie chances every time.   I made the putts.   So I was rolling the ball really well today.   
So, yeah, it was overall a solid round.   
THE MODERATOR:   You're fourth in Rookie of the Year, first year.   Talk about your year overall coming up to this final stretch.   
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   Yeah, I think the beginning of my year was a little bit of a hit‑or‑miss.   I'd either be way up there in contention or I would miss the cut.   
Then I would say the last like six, seven weeks or so, more than that, I've really kind of calmed down a little bit, and it's been much more consistent.   So it's been fun.   
THE MODERATOR:   What has been the buzz about coming to this stop?   How have you been adjusting to the conditions?   
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   I've been adjusting pretty well.   The hospitality here is so fantastic.   Our hotel is gorgeous.   I mean, the course is beautiful.   The clubhouse.   Everyone is just so nice.   It's been a really fun experience so far.   
It is really, really hot.   But, I mean, I have my little sun umbrella, my compression sleeve, so I'm trying to manage.   
THE MODERATOR:   Like you said, in contention.   Any thoughts going into the weekend?   
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   Just do what I do, have been doing the last two days.   You know, I've had some good practice this year being in contention going into the weekend, so I'm hoping I can learn from those experiences I have.   Hopefully it will be my week.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Sydnee.   
   
 Q.   What has been good for you in terms of this week?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   My putter.   I've been hitting the ball well, too.   I've been working on my putting the last month and it's paying off, so...   
   
 Q.   Great round.   Will there be playing catch‑up this weekend?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   No.   Golf is a crazy sport where the tournament can change in one hole.   There's two days left, so that's a lot of golf to be played.   
I'm just hoping to go out and play well again the next two days, and hopefully my name will be at the top.   
   
 Q.   This is your rookie year on tour.   This is your first visit to Asia?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   I've been to Japan twice.   This is my first time to Southeast Asia.   
   
 Q.   Are you enjoying the experience?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   Yeah, no, everyone is so nice.   I'm having fun so far.   I went shopping yesterday.   Everyone is so nice.   I'm really enjoying my time.   
THE MODERATOR:   Where did you go and what did you buy?   
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   I bought like so many clothes (laughter).   I found this one store in the mall that's attached to our hotel.   I think they were looking at me like, Are you crazy?   
THE MODERATOR:   Just a local store?   
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   Yeah, it was a local store.   I just bought like, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   Probably love when the golfers come into town.   
   
 Q.   Can you take us through your birdies today?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   I have a terrible memory with my round, so I'll try to remember.   
But I had one birdie on 2.   
Then I think I made another birdie on 8 possibly.   
I made a bogey on 9.   
Then my back nine, I kind of had a hot stretch and made five birdies in a row.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the club, yardage.   
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   Oh, God, I don't know if I can remember that.   I don't know how many under I am, I don't even know.   
THE MODERATOR:   Any crazy long putts?   
SYDNEE MICHAELS:   I mean, I had a couple like 25‑footers that were good, solid putts.   
Yeah, those five holes, I gave myself a birdie chance, and I took advantage of it, so...   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
