 Q.  Top-10 finish in the Women's Open and the eagle late was probably a real big help?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: Definitely.  I played solid all day and just the putts just weren't dropping.  I had a lot of close ones.  But I needed that.  Yeah, I had just made a bogey on the hole prior.  And I hit a great shot in there, rolled it in.  That was awesome.   
 Q.  Were you kind of surprised when you got to the tee and saw where it was?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: When I saw what?   
 Q.  Where it was on the par 5?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: Yeah, well, I eagled the one on the back nine.  Yeah, so, No. 3 was moved up, which makes it fun.  We like it when they move the tees around and they make reachable par-5s.   
 Q.  How about the conditions out there this afternoon?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: You know, I thought yesterday was a little windier, but today was really gusty.  So it almost made it harder, because you weren't sure -- like yesterday was just a steady wind, and today was just a little more gusty.  And the pins were, a couple of them were tucked.  So it was really hard to get close to a couple of them.  It's just a great golf course, it's awesome.   
 Q.  Are you a scoreboard watcher?  Have you seen what's going on?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: Yeah, I like to see what's going on, just to see what I need to do.  So, yeah, I was keeping an eye on it.  I don't focus on it, but I just like to see what's going on.   
 Q.  The way it's stacked up, are you going to stay around and watch a little bit?  
SYDNEE MICHAELS: Maybe, yeah, I'll hang out a little bit.
