  SYDNEE MICHAELS: I made a lot of good, solid putts and I hit a lot of good shots.  I think I hit every fairway.  I think I missed maybe one fairway.Q. Was there one critical up-and-down that was key to keeping your rhythm?SYDNEE MICHAELS: Yeah, I don't remember what hole it is.  I think it must be -- I made a really good up-and-down on hole No. 4.  I was 1-over par.  I hit a really great chip shot and I think that helped, as well. 11, I made probably a 10-footer to save par.  Those are always nice to make to keep the round going.Q. How many birdies did you make?SYDNEE MICHAELS: I think -- I honestly don't really remember.  I think they were about 10, 11, 12 feet, around there.  I didn't stuff any and have a tap-in.  So they were solid shots and I hit a good putt.Q. U.S. Open, 2-under par, it has to be a good feeling?SYDNEE MICHAELS: Oh, yeah, for sure.  Anything under par in a major at the U.S. Open, you're doing pretty good.  So I'm pleased with how I played today.Q. Are you happy you played in the morning?SYDNEE MICHAELS: I don't know, I mean some people think it's easier in the morning.  Some people think it's easier in the afternoon because it dries out a little bit so it plays shorter.  I try not to really think about that.Q. It probably didn't take you long to figure out you weren't going to get --SYDNEE MICHAELS: Yeah, I mean, obviously it was drizzling when I got here, so I knew it was going to play long.  But it's okay.  I hit the ball well.Q. It stopped?SYDNEE MICHAELS: Yeah, it stopped.  It was nice weather.Q. If you reach a point when there's a mistake, what do you do to get yourself right?SYDNEE MICHAELS: You know, I just tried really hard to focus over my putts.  And I thought even if I make a bogey or even if I miss it, I know I'm hitting it well enough where I'm going to hit other good shots and have a chance to get it back.  That kind of took the pressure off it, for sure, knowing I was going to hit more good shots and have a chance to make the putt.Q. What about the crowds?SYDNEE MICHAELS: It's awesome.  I can't believe it.  I was out here Sunday and there were people watching.  It's amazing.  It's so much fun.  We love it.  We love having people come out, and it's so fun to play in front of.  Everyone has been so supportive.Q. Have you been to town?SYDNEE MICHAELS: I haven't been to Lancaster.  I've been to Harrisburg and I think other places.  The town is great.Q. Will this carry you over to tomorrow and maybe putting yourself further up the leaderboard?SYDNEE MICHAELS: I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.  Just fairways and greens.
