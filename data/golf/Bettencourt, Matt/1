Q.   Wanted to ask you‑‑ so from the PGA TOUR the media center, they wanted to ask a little bit about the situation with your caddie there on 18. 
MATT BETTENCOURT:   Yeah, my brother‑in‑law was caddieing for me and I hit a tee shot that bounced into the hazard and there was three or four balls down on the tide.   The tide was out on the beach, so we just‑‑ we made our way down the hill there and his left heel caught a piece of moss on the rock.   And I tried to grab him, was a couple inches away and the next thing I know‑‑ I mean, he hit his head twice on the rock.   He just bounced. 
And so now I know from talking to my wife, that he broke his shoulder and his forearm and so I think they're doing surgery right now as we speak.   So I'm headed over to the hospital to go see how he is.

Q.   They took him directly to the hospital?
MATT BETTENCOURT:   Yeah, took them 25 minutes.   We had to let a group play through us because they couldn't figure out how to get him back up the hill.   They had to put him on a board to get him up the hill. 

Q.   So you had a replacement caddie that stepped in?
MATT BETTENCOURT:   I grew up in this area so I had a bunch of friends watching.   So one of them came over and caddied for me the last nine holes, which was nice. 
So, but interesting week.   We were ‑‑ spent Wednesday night in the hospital.   My wife's pregnant.   She had an issue.   Thank goodness everything's okay there, so getting to know this little hospital here ‑‑ quite too well. 

Q.   How did today's round go for you?
MATT BETTENCOURT:   It wasn't really good.   I shot a few over.   Just was kind of scared for him.   When his bone went through his arm, it was compound, so that was bad.
