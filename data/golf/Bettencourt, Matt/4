Q.   Just talk about the round today and what was going well for you. 
MATT BETTENCOURT:   I putted really well today, made probably five putts over ten feet.   So it's always nice to see putts go in.
I hit a couple of errant tee balls, but I got away with them.   The putter saves everything.   I feel really good with my putting.   I like the greens.   As long as you're putting well, you're always going to be right there.

Q.   How have things been going for you this year?   Obviously you never know.   It's hard to get in ‑‑
MATT BETTENCOURT:   Yeah, yeah.   It's been tough.   I'm patient, play when I get in, and when I don't, that's okay.   This is kind of what I expected, another tough year, being a shortened season.   So I'm just happy to play.

Q.   What's your schedule look like?   Are you going to be going back and forth?
MATT BETTENCOURT:   Yeah.   I'll probably play here and the Web.com Tour.   So I'll be going back between the two tours, and I'll make the best of it.   It'll be fun.

Q.   Looking to tomorrow, and even later today, I don't know if the winds are going to come up.   Conditions were pretty good this morning. 
MATT BETTENCOURT:   They were perfect.   Yeah, they were great.   They were great the last four holes for us yesterday, and they were pretty much perfect for the first 16 holes today. 
It's really scorable.   Everything's soft.   I think you would see some really low scores.   If the wind picks up, I think it's a heck of a golf course.

Q.   What have you got planned the rest of the day?
MATT BETTENCOURT:   Heat, shower and pool time, for sure.
