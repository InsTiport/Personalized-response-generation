   MATT BETTENCOURT: I struggled today. I hit some really loose wedge shots. I drove the ball terrible. And I putted terrible; I had four three-putts. It's tough to score when you have four three-putts. But I brought it back and shot even par. I was four over with six to go and brought it back to even, which was great. So, if I can go out tomorrow and shoot three of four under we'll see where that leaves me.  
 There's a lot of golf left. I've run off stretches where I've birdied four, five or six in a row so you just have to think back and stay focused and positive.  
 About his eagle ...   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: I hit a great driver to about 12 to 14 feet and rolled the putt in dead center. That was fantastic."  
 Playing close to his hometown of Greenville...   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: I'm about an hour and a half away. I have a lot of family and friends here.
