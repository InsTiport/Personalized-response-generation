  Q. Did you play the pro-am?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: No, I was going to play Gleneagles. I'm playing the British Open qualifier on Monday. I had my clubs in the car at the hotel. I brought them downstairs, put them out in the car, went back into the hotel for about 20 minutes, and somebody had smashed the window in and stole everything out of it, including the clubs.  
  
  Q. What else was in there?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: A portable GPS.  
  
  Q. Your GPS?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: It was mine, yeah. My wedding ring, my watch was in my bag. So yeah, it sucks. But what are you going to do? It's just disappointing.  
  
  Q. How long had you played with your putter?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: About 15 months.   
  
  Q. So what are you playing with this week?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: I don't know, an Odyssey or something.   
  
  Q. Did you just go to the trailer and they put something together?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, they built me a set of clubs that's very similar to mine, but you never know. Everything is different, shafts are different, clubs are different. You've got the distances for distance control --  
  
  Q. Did you get a chance to play with them at all yesterday?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: No. I just got them all yesterday.   
  
  Q. On the greens is that putter just a lot different?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: I mean, you have certain things you're comfortable with, so you can figure it out.   
  
  Q. And this is just some kind of Odyssey?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, it's an Odyssey XG. How does that sound? I don't know the name of it. That's what it's called. I didn't know what it was called.   
 I was right there across the street from No. 14 at the Holiday Inn Express.   
  
  Q. That's just a shock to the system.   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: It's pretty bad when they said their cameras didn't work when I went back in there. It happens every year at this tournament apparently. I won't comment anymore, but yeah.   
  
  Q. At that hotel?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: I don't know. I really don't know.  
  
  Q. Have you heard of other players --  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, I have heard of other players that I've actually spoken to. It happens every week.
