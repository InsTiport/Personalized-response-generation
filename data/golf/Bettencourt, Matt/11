  Q. An opening 5-under, 65. Got to be feeling good. Just a few comments about the round.  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, you know, I hit it pretty good today. Made a few putts; left a few putts out there.  
 All in all, it was a great day other than the par-5s, you got to attack these par-5s. They're both reachable. I played them pretty pathetic, a bogey and a par.   
 So I'll go out there tomorrow, and hopefully I can maintain my same swing. I'm enjoy thinking place. It's a great place. If I can take advantage of the par-5s, that's what I need to do.  
  
  Q. How about just the history of the place, the course. Obviously a lot of history here. Is that pretty neat to be a part of?   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Oh, it's awesome. There's so much tradition here. It's pretty cool to think of all the great names that have played and won here.   
 To have a PGA Tour event back here, it's just phenomenal. We owe a lot to Mr. Justice. It's a really great thing that he's done.
