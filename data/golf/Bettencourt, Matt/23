   On competing at THE PLAYERS Championship for the first time.  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: It's an honor. It's the strongest field all year that we play. The golf course is the greatest fan stadium course on earth. It's going to be a great week and I'm excited to see where my game stands against the world's best.  
 On watching this tournament over the years and what sticks with him.  

 MATT BETTENCOURT: Obviously the finish, holes 16-18 stick with you. Seventeen is probably the most exciting hole in golf. Anything can happen there and a lot can change. If you look at it though, 17 is the largest green on the golf course, so if you put it in that perspective it shouldn't be that big of a deal with a wedge or a nine-iron.   
 On playing 17 this week in practice rounds.   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: I've played this golf course about five times before this week. I played 17 yesterday, I actually played with Rocco and he lived out here for about 16 years so he gave me a lot of insight which was good. I'll go out and play the back-nine this afternoon so hopefully I'll be set.  
 On his mindset standing on 17 tee changing once competition starts.  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Sure. There will probably be some adrenaline flowing, but you're hitting to a small portion of the green so hopefully that will keep it in perspective. We've all hit a million wedges so at this level you just try and block out the water. There will definitely be a lot of excitement though.
