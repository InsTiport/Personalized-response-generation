  Q. Just some general thoughts. I know the ending wasn't good, but overall you're still co-lead.   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, I'm playing good. I'm hitting it really well, I'm just not getting -- I'm getting some misfortune. Drove it in three divots today, and unfortunately I didn't have a shot.   
 Hit it in the bunker on 8. I guess the group in front of us, their caddies, they didn't rake the bunker. There was a footprint there. Had no shot.   
 I'm just frustrated right now.  
  
  Q. Sure. I mean, you're still tied for the lead.   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, I'm fine.   
  
  Q. Are there things tomorrow you're gonna try to work on?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: No, I don't need to work on anything. I just need to keep playing the way I'm playing and everything will be fine.
