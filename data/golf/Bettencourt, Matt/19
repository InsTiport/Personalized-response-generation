 Q. Just for someone who's working here, how exciting is it to be in the final round here? How exciting is that? 
 MATT BETTENCOURT: It's awesome. It's a dream come true. Best golf course I've ever played. I mean, the conditions, everything about it was just perfect this week, the weather. 
 The crowds were the best. So, yeah, it's like living a dream. It was great. Really enjoyed the moment. 

 Q. Today was great too? 
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Absolutely. It's great. Are you kidding me? 

 Q. Did you catch yourself looking at the leaderboard and see Tiger playing? 
 MATT BETTENCOURT: I actually didn't look at the leaderboard. I can't control what anybody does. I can only do what I can do and play the best I can play. Unfortunately, I hit three or four bad shots, and it really cost me. 

 Q. Certainly seemed like you and Mark Wilson got along well? 
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Mark and I got along great. He's a great guy. It's a joy to play with Mark. Great time. 

 Q. So what happened today was a golf thing, not an attitude? 
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Absolutely. It's a tough golf course. You hit a few bad shots, and you're going to get penalized out here. 

 Q. You hear the roars and wonder what was going on? 
 MATT BETTENCOURT: You know. Absolutely. He's the king. He's the best. 

 Q. What do you take away from this tournament as a whole? What it does for you. 
 MATT BETTENCOURT: That I know that I can play with the world's best at any time. I don't know if I would change anything about my game. 

 Q. How validated do you feel? 
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Very much so. Very validated. Thank you guys.
