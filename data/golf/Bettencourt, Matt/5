 Q. Five birdies, an eagle, 12 points, overall 20 through two rounds.   Talk a little bit about the day and how things went.   
               
MATT BETTENCOURT:   Yeah, went out there and hit it very well for the most part.   Hit a couple poor tee shots, but other than that I hit it really well, really solid.  
You know, I got to start making a few more short putts.   I had another couple three‑putts from three feet, so that's five in two rounds.   
Other than that, kind of throwing some points away with short birdie putts and turn them into bogeys.  
I'm very happy with 20 points.   Just enjoying this place.   I love it so much up here.   
   
 Q.   Excited to be back after last year?   
MATT BETTENCOURT:   Yeah, so disappointing last year.   I so looking forward to coming out and defending my title, and it was just the biggest disappointment of the year.   
So, yeah, really excited to be back and feeling well and just enjoying the course and the town.   I just love it here.  
   
 Q.   After a tough start today, are your finding any momentum?  
MATT BETTENCOURT:   Yeah, that's golf.   It's just up and down, up and down.   You've got to have a short‑term memory.   I'm not worried about anything that's happened in the past.   I'm just looking forward to having a great week.
