  Q. First of all, great round today.   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Thank you.  
  
  Q. If I could get some comments, are there any highlights from the round that kept it going?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: The only highlight I guess would be on No. 7. I chipped in from about 30 yards short of the green. Kind of pitched a shot in the hole, so that was exciting to see to fall in. It was a good shot, too, so that was exciting.  
 Other than that, just a steady day; hit 16 greens in regulation and made a couple putts here and there.  
  
  Q. Any thoughts on moving up the leaderboard? Does it change your strategy for the weekend?   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Oh, I haven't even looked at it. I have no idea. I assume I made the cut.  
  
  Q. Yeah. Yeah, I would say so.   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: No, I've played here enough to know that I have to go out and play solid on the weekend. Yeah, I won't look at the leaderboard really until I'm finished playing tomorrow, and hopefully I'm up there.  
  
  Q. Yeah. And lastly, just comments about how your year went, any highlights.   
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, you know, it started out strong this year. Battled some injuries and was out for a couple months with a rib injury. I'm just glad to be back playing and looking forward to next year.
