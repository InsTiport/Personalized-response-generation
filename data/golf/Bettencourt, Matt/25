   NATIONWIDE TOUR MEDIA OFFICIAL: This is a Cinderella story to you. Talk us through the last move and a half potentially.  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Well, it's really hard to put into words and emotion. It started in Boise, I finished fifth place and moved up the money list, and put myself in position just to retain status, at 53rd on the money list. Then getting the victory in Oregon and playing as well as I did there. It was a dream come true.   
 Put me into 22nd, which moved me into great contention to get my PGA TOUR card. Gave me a job for a while.   
 You know, it's just surreal at that point. And to go into Miami and play my heart out as good as I can, to hole that shot for eagle one of the great finishes in golf, it was awesome to be part of that. I'm proud of him. It's great stuff.   
 To come back and bounce back after an event like that and come out ask here and win, it shows my heart. I've never given up on anything, and I don't ever plan to.  
  
  Q. Not just winning the Nationwide Tour Championship, but the money title?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, that's the whole thing. Winning the money title, wow. It's just a dream come true.   
 When the schedule is released, I can look at it and make my own schedule. Every event that I want to be in. It's just, it makes it so much easier and stressless. It's just it's a dream. It's an absolute dream.  
  
  Q. And the bonus of the Players' Championship?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yes, oh, my gosh. Play against the best field in the world, wow. Could you can for anything more. It's going to be great.  
  
  Q. Doing it in front of your parents is pretty cool?  
 MATT BETTENCOURT: Yeah, it's so special to do it in front of my family. My parents and my fiancee, and her family. Wow. It's just it couldn't have been any better.   
  
  Q. That's fantastic, Matt. Appreciate your time?
