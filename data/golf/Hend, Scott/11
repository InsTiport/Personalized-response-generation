Q. Quite a different performance today from the last two days.
SCOTT HEND: Yeah, finally feel like I'm getting over the food poisoning from last week.  Body is starting to feel good, starting to feel strong in my swing again and could actually swing the golf club like I know I can, which is quite nice.
Q. Was there any point in the round you could break the course record today?
SCOTT HEND: No, because we've got lift, clean and place anyway, so it wouldn't be a course record.  I was just trying to catch up and go off the first tee tomorrow.  That was my goal, instead of teeing off on 10.  Like I said, I felt a lot stronger today and I felt a lot better.  So it's just a shame it's come a little late in the week.
Q. And how much was the Order of Merit in the back of your mind today?
SCOTT HEND: Look, if Anirban wins, there's no chance.  I've just got to try to secure second spot.  I need to try and get as many World Ranking points here for my World Ranking and just play as good as I can.  I can't control what Anirban is doing.  He's playing great golf this week, and if he wins, it's a fantastic effort.
Q. Now that you are so well placed going into the final day, what's your strategy?
SCOTT HEND: Same as today.  Hopefully make some birdies.  Don't make any bogeys and climb up the board.
