SCOTT HEND: Yeah, it was nice.  Playing alongside Marc, we had a good time there on the back nine.  We struggled a little bit on the front, but we managed to string together some good swings on the back nine and made some nice birdies.   
 Q.  How do you regroup after that start?  
SCOTT HEND: It's golf, mate.  The positive is I didn't make a double bogey today.  I made a double every other day.  If you make two bogeys, it's like making a double and I bounced back from that and just trying to play.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: Yeah, yeah, we thought we missed because I bogeyed both the par-5s coming in yesterday and we thought we were at least one shot short and it was a pleasure to sit back and watch the cut mark come back to us and have an opportunity to play today, which we thought we weren't going to have.  So it's great to actually be out here on Saturday at The Open.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: Well, it's pretty stressful sitting there watching it going back and forward, because at one stage I was in and I was out and I was in and I was out.  I was going to have the attitude anyway of you come out on a Saturday and try to enjoy it and do what you can.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: You said that?  Did you?  I wouldn't have believed you.  I knew that I'd messed up.  It's pretty hard when it's in your control and then all of a sudden it's out of your control.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: Yeah, I think the cutoff for the PGA may be after this weekend.  So I'm like 106 in the world right now and I'm pretty sure that -- nobody knows the exact number that's going to get in, but I'd rather be sitting well inside that, and getting an opportunity to play in Quail Hollow, which is one of my favourite courses in the U.S.  So I really want to go play there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: I think it's more today I was able to match the speed with my lines.  The last couple of days I was either getting the right line and leaving it short or getting the wrong line and hitting -- I just couldn't get the right speed to where I wanted to putt it to, and today we just managed to all of a sudden on the back nine there and in the front nine rolled a couple of putts in and it went well.  I haven't done that the last four days around here and I actually holed a couple of putts.  Once you start seeing your line, you can pretty much figure it out a little bit better.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: Sure, it does.  It's always great playing with another Aussie.  And especially Marc hits it pretty pure, so it's nice to watch another guy that can actually shape the ball around and hit some good shots.  It could have been negative if we both started hitting it really bad, it's just the way it goes.  But we can have a nice chat about stuff and see what's going on.  It's always nice to play beside and against a guy that you know.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: It was brutal yesterday.  It was really brutal.  If you let your guard down, like I did on the back nine, you can drop shots really easily.  And today it's chalk and cheese really.  Someone can shoot a 63 or 64.  If the wind stays down, it's right there from for them to get it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: You never know.  63 is a great score in an Open Championship.  But you never know.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: Yeah, it's been in the back of my mind, yeah.  The last Presidents Cup I thought I was one win away from possibly getting a position in the team.  But I think I need to do something drastically outrageous, like shoot 61 tomorrow and win this tournament or play great in the Bridgestone coming up.  It's going to have to be something ridiculous for me to get a pick in the team.  But I know it's a possibility.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SCOTT HEND: Correct, yeah.  Yeah, it can be the ongoing effect of -- that would be awesome.  Ryder Cups for Europe and Presidents Cup, to be an Aussie and play in The Presidents Cup against the U.S., that would be fantastic.
