Q.   An opening 69, apart from that bogey on 17, you're pretty right up there. 
SCOTT HEND:   Yeah, well, you know, first round here, a long way to go obviously.   Played just really nice golf today and yeah, I just had a bad swing on 17, got it riding in the breeze and made a bogey.   I mean, that was pretty much my only full shot of the day and I played quite nicely.

Q.   Your partnership with Tony still working out?
SCOTT HEND:   Of course, always will be.   It's going to be a sad day for me when he goes back to playing himself.

Q.   You mentioned you like to play on this golf course because it favours your became because of the distance, as well?
SCOTT HEND:   I think so, and the greens are fantastic.   This year obviously it's a little different because they renovated the course and the fairways are quite soft at the moment and so the ball not going very far at all.   If you can hit your driver pretty far, obviously got to be in the fairway but makes it a lot easier to try and make birdies.
