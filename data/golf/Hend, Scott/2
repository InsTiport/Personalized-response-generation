Q. A 63 has elevated you considerably up the leaderboard?
SCOTT HEND: Yeah, I think by the end of the day should be somewhere around just inside the Top-10, so good opportunity to get to The Open next week.
Q. How have conditions changed this week?  Seems the better scoring has been on the front nine.  The wind seems to have switched and now there are more birdie opportunities on the back nine.
SCOTT HEND: To be honest I find both nines just as difficult as each other, so doesn't matter which way the wind is going.  Just a matter of keeping out of the bunkers and try to hole some putts.  Whichever way the wind blows, it doesn't really bother me.
Q. What's been the main difference this week seeing you score consistently better over three days?
SCOTT HEND: I didn't have a 5-putt this week, so it's been pretty good so far.
Q. Excited now to be in contention going into Sunday?
SCOTT HEND: Yeah, it's always great, especially in these event and links golf courses, to be there or thereabouts, it's always great to play courses like this and produce a score which you think is better than average.
Q. You mention it's difficult.  Is it enjoyable to play?
SCOTT HEND: It's awesome.  It's awesome.  It does your head in.  That's the best thing about it, it's so good.  Not just boring, down the middle, do whatever.  Bit off this, bit off that, try not to hit yourself out of the bunker.  It's all good fun.
