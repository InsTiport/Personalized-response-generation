Q.   I have to ask what it means to you.
SCOTT HEND:   Everything.   I've won five times out here on the Asian Tour, and I've come very close on the PGA TOUR and European Tour and finally, finally at the age of 41 I've finally won a European Tour event and Asian Tour event coâ€‘sanctioned.   It's very special. 
This one is for my kids.   This one is for Aston and McLaren back in Florida.   They have been sending me music messages the last three mornings.   Yeah, it's very much to be treasured.

Q.   Think every victory is special, but this one as a European Tour, at a course like this and field like this, is it all the more so?
SCOTT HEND:   For sure.   This golf course doesn't really play into my wheelhouse.   Doesn't play to my strengths.   I have to be very mentally tough and play the course mentally right and Tony and I, we managed to do it this week and sort of unlocked the puzzle.
Now I can celebrate and now I'm happy.   Now, it's awesome.   I live to play golf and this is what it's all about.   This is what makes it worthwhile.

Q.   And when you and Angelo are walking down the fairway together, good mates. 
SCOTT HEND:   I'm good mates with Angelo, good mates with Marcus, all of the guys, most of the guys as you can be. 
Like I said, I feel bad for Angelo for making the bogey the way he did.   I would have liked to make a birdie to win or him make a birdie to win.   Of course we want to win but you don't want to see your competitor make a mistake for you to win.   But like I said, I'll take the win and I'll treasure it.

Q.   We've seen you for years, but now you can start planning.   You've opened a few doors. 
SCOTT HEND:   It's great, isn't it.   It's awesome.   Love it.   Europe, here I come.
