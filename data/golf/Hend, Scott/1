Q. I know you would have liked to have made another birdie on the last, but 5-under for the back nine, you must be thrilled with that.
SCOTT HEND: Yeah, it was a nice finish to the round to finish with a couple birdies anyway.  18 is playing different from years gone past where they've grown the rough out a bit.  We're just trying to get used to where to hit a driver down there.  But par on that hole never really hurts you, and it was a good day.
Q. How did you find the course conditions today?  I know it looks beautiful, some of the guys are talking about how the ball wasn't flying early in the morning when it was colder.  A few players having difficulty reading the greens.  How did you find it?
SCOTT HEND: The course is fine.  I was very fortunate that I was second to last group out so I got to go when it was a bit warmer, so the ball flew a bit more than sort of normal length.  I'm quite fortunate where I was in the draw.  We'll see tomorrow whether I can finish in the sunshine or the dark.  There's nothing around the golf course.  The course is fine.  I'm from Queensland, I'm used to reading grain, so it's okay with me.
Q. I know not that long ago you said your putter wasn't performing, so you caffeinated it one night.  Obviously it's working for you.  Where did you get that idea from?
SCOTT HEND: Oh, just -- being a golf professional for 20-odd years, in apprenticeship, so in the pro shop fooling around when you're a young trainee in Australia in the Australian PGA, and it's just the things you do when you're bored.
