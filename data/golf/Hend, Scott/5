Q. 8-under par, Saturday very much been moving day?
SCOTT HEND: Yeah, I think by the end of the day I'll be inside the Top-10.  Obviously guys still to go out.  The course is out there to be had.  You know, it's good for tomorrow.
Q. You played 13, 14 and 15 at 8-under par this week.  Is it nice to know those holes are coming up, when you can hit the ball as far as you can?
SCOTT HEND: Still got it get it in play.  I don't really think about those things at the time.  Just trying to get the ball in play to start off with, and if you can make a birdie or an eagle, so be it.
Q. One round in France last week that cost you a better finish there.  Generally how do you feel the game is shaping up at the moment?
SCOTT HEND: It's getting better and better.  I've got an immediate goal to get back to the Top-100 in the world for the PGA Championship coming up.  Not sure when the cutoff exactly is, but just working towards that.
