  THE MODERATOR:     Congratulations.   How does it feel to be the champion of the Hong Kong Open?   
SCOTT HEND:   Fantastic.   Sitting here amongst obviously Mr. JimÃ©nez who has won many times and all the Australians that have won this golf tournament, a very prestigious tournament.   
THE MODERATOR:   Talk us through the playoff with Angelo.   
SCOTT HEND:   It was a bit surreal because obviously I walked straight off the golf course after making a fantastic up‑and‑down for par to get to the playoff.   And then sort of‑‑ it's great to win but I feel a little bit of sadness for Angelo making a bogey the way he did to lose the hole.   
Obviously we all want to win the playoff but it would have been nice to make a birdie and beat your opponent instead of your opponent making an uncalculated mistake.   But I'll take the trophy.   I'll take the title.   
   
 Q.   Another big week coming up for you next week, defending your title.   Is it going to be hard to win two in a row?   
SCOTT HEND:   If I don't get too hungover tonight, I might have a chance.   
I love Mac could you.   Love the golf course.   Obviously I'm swinging the golf club pretty good right now, so anything can happen.   
   
 Q.   Will this mean you'll spend most of your time playing on The European Tour next season?   
SCOTT HEND:   You know, I'll play a lot in Europe but I'll also try to fulfill my minimum tournaments here in Asia and support the Asian Tour as much as I can.   I feel that's a very important thing to do.   So I'll have a pretty busy schedule but it's one to look forward to try and play in.   
   
 Q.   Your approach on the last hole, what was your plan?   Were you trying to make a birdie or were you just trying to play safe and go for a playoff?  
SCOTT HEND:   I saw the board when I was on 16, and I saw that Angelo had finished on 13‑under.   But in this game, in this day and age, you don't believe the score boards all the time.   Mistakes do happen.   
So our plan was to play 17 and 18 the way we played it every single day, and you know, would have been nice to roll a birdie in on 17 and not have to worry about trying to make birdie up 18.   But to be honest with you, when I was playing 18 the first time around, I was just trying to hit it 20 feet left of the pin and if I hold the putt in for birdie to win, I rolled the putt in.   Otherwise just go to the playoff and see what happens, because it's a dangerous golf hole.   
Anything can happen on that hole.   We've seen it happen over the gears with the great playoffs when Wen Liang hit it out of the trees to a foot.   It's a dangerous hole and you don't want to play yourself out of it.   
   
 Q.   You made a special regard on 18 green to your caddie.   So is it your own caddie and in which part of the game does he give you a lot of assistance?   
SCOTT HEND:   Tony Carolan has been a member of the Asian Tour himself.   He's played this tournament here I think seven or eight times.   He's a golf professional and we've known each other for over 20 years.   When he had an injury and could no longer play on the Tour, he said he would come out and help me by caddying for me.   
Since he's been on the bag, we've had four wins in two years.   So he's a great mate, and sacrificing his own career to come out and help me and help me get over the line for a week.   
   
 Q.   I believe you're the first Australian to win this tournament since the great Greg Norman in '83, and I'm guessing he was a hero of yours growing up.   Talk about what that means to you?  
SCOTT HEND:   I wasn't aware of that, but you know, obviously the Shark is the man from Australia.   If my career could be a quarter as good as Greg's I'd be pretty happy.   
Like I said, there's a lot of great Australians, Kel Nagle, Peter Thomson, Greg Norman, the list goes on.   It's a great trophy as an Australian to get your name on, and like I said, this golf course has got a lot of history on it.   The members are great members and everything is fantastic around here.   You never have a problem here.   It's a pleasure to come and play here.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel nervous in the playoff?   You're walking with Angelo on the fairways, but on the other hand on the first putt, you drank some water.   So do you feel nervous or relaxed in the playoff?   
SCOTT HEND:   There's things you go to try to slow yourself down a little bit.   To be honest I was more nervous at the start of the day than I was in the playoff hole.   Once you get into the round, start of the day‑‑ if you're not nervous, you don't want to be here.   If you're not nervous, you shouldn't be here.   We all want to win.   
So it's a feeling that you get and it's the reason why I come and play golf and I want to be in contention.   I really thrive for the feeling of feeling nervous and I was less nervous on the playoff than I was before I teed off.   
   
 Q.   You dedicated the win to your kids.   How old are they?   Will you get them a nice present from Hong Kong?  
SCOTT HEND:   They had better not get any more presents.   I want to throw half the toys out already, there's too many (laughter).  
They have been watching the replays back in Florida.   My wife has been taping it and they have been watching me.   My wife's been having to pause the TV to see Tony on TV.   We just played the Web.com playoffs a couple weeks ago in America and I've had a dreadful time of it.   
They will see it, and like I say, this one is dedicated to them.   They spend a lot of time without me, they are twins, Aston and McLaren, a boy and a girl.   They are eight years old, so they have had to do the hardship without me being there and me being away playing golf.   So it's for them.
