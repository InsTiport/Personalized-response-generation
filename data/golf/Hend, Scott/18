 Q.  Just your thoughts for the day.  67 in the final round.  
SCOTT HEND: Pretty lackluster finish.  Shot 5-under on the back nine to start and then just shot even par coming in.  Couldn't really get anything going coming in today.  It is what it is.  Good finish.   
 Q.  How would you sum up your week so far for the CIMB?  
SCOTT HEND: Average.  Average.  Average to better than average.  I mean, obviously, finishing somewhere in the middle of the field is not what you want, but then again you don't want to finish last.   
 Q.  Anything that was holding you back this week?  
SCOTT HEND: Didn't hole enough putts.  You got to hole a lot of putts against these guys.  You got to hole a lot of putts or you're going to be behind the 8-ball.   
 Q.  I have to ask you about the Order of Merit.  
SCOTT HEND: It's over.  Finished.  Pretty much had to win this week, otherwise Anirban is going to have it wrapped up.  He's played fantastic golf, obviously, at the start of the year and deserves it.
