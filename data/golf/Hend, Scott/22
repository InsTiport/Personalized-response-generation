 Q.   What's your verdict on 7â€‘under over two days?  
SCOTT HEND:   Thereabouts, it's a good start to the week.   Try to chase down Ernie over the weekend and hopefully hole a few more putts, and who knows.   I haven't been playing very well of late so trying to change that around.   Been working hard on it and some promising signs.  
   
 Q.   Decent stuff over the two days?  
SCOTT HEND:   Yeah, it's one of those golf courses where you can't overpower the golf course.   You just have to take your ticket and wait for your number to come around before you make a birdie and that's how you have to look at it.   
You have to really position the ball and hope you can sort of read the grain on the green.   That's the key to the golf course.   If you fall behind your game plan and you try and change mid round on the game plan, it just destroys you.   So got to be patient.  
   
 Q.   You say you haven't been playing particularly well.   Any particular reason for it?   
SCOTT HEND:   Didn't get to play enough through the middle of the year.   I'm the sort of player who likes to get a run, six out of seven weeks, have a week off and play six in a row again.   That's the way I've always been.   I like to play a lot of golf.   And when I play very sporadically, I fall over the edge of the cliff and struggle to get out of the canyon.   
I had a very good year last year.   Tried to get invites on the Web.com and get invites here and there and couldn't secure any invites.   That's the way it goes.   When they get older, they want the college guys.   They don't want the old boys.   I understand they want to give the young guys a run.   That's the way it goes.
