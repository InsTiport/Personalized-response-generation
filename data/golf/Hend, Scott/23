 Q.   Scott, a 74 yesterday, but a flawless 66 today.   
SCOTT HEND:   I played the same as I did today.   I'm playing great.   Just a matter of getting the ball in position to hole a few putts.   Yesterday I hit some great shots but the ball was just on the wrong side of the hole.   So just keep going, do what I'm doing.  
   
 Q.   Was it a matter of going back to the practice range yesterday and finding your game?   
SCOTT HEND:   No, I didn't go back to the practice range at all.   Like I said I'm playing great, I'm thinking good, I'm doing everything good.   It's just a matter of waiting till the score comes; let it come to you.   
   
 Q.   What's your plan for the last 18, play aggressively?  
SCOTT HEND:   Just do what I'm doing for the whole week.   Just play solid and hopefully I can build on a score and that's all I can do.
