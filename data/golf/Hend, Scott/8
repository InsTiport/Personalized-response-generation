 Q.  Scott, your assessment for the day?  
SCOTT HEND: Bit of a struggle out there today.  Swing wasn't really in the slot.  But we know this golf course well enough that we just tried to manage what was going on.  We'll see if we can improve tomorrow in the morning when we should get pure putting surfaces and hopefully no wind and go forward tomorrow.   
 Q.  Long season, trying to find the groove?  
SCOTT HEND: I'm really tired.  I need the time off.  I need to get back in the gym and I need to get ready for next season.  It's been a really long year but it's been a great year.  I can't complain about it.  It's been fantastic.  It's just been long.   
 Q.  Anything good, positive for this round, maybe coming back from those three bogeys?  
SCOTT HEND: I was playing a tricky part of the golf course.  I just got tricked up out there.  Made a few bogeys.  It's a tough, tough part of the golf course.  I didn't hit the appropriate shots and I got punished for it.  That's pretty much all there is to it.  I played quite solid but just didn't get the ball in the hole enough.   
The course is in fantastic condition, and I think the greens are good enough that if you hit quality shots, and obviously the way they are rolling, you've got a good opportunity to shoot some good scores out here.
