 Q.   Maybe just sum up the week.   
SCOTT HEND:   It was a bit of a tough week for me.   I didn't really play as good as I would have wished.   It's always a bit hard after winning the week before, and I just didn't hole as many putts this week as what I did last week.   I hit it pretty good.   Looking forward to playing the HSBC next week and hopefully producing a better result.  
   
 Q.   At the start of the week you were slightly less than $200,000.   
SCOTT HEND:   Yeah, like I said, all I can do is play as well as I can and if he didn't produce the goods then I could catch him.   It's great to see him playing as good as he is at the moment.   Hopefully he can come through and win this week.   It would be great for him to win, and I'd love to see him win, as well, because I think he's got the game.   He plays great shots.   He's a flamboyant player and he putts well.   I personally hope he plays well enough to win, and if he does, all credit goes to him, fantastic.  
   
 Q.   How big will it be for Asia if he does win?  
SCOTT HEND:   Oh, it would be great.   He's obviously won‑‑ be exempt in Europe as a winner, be exempt on the PGA TOUR as a winner, also be the Asian Tour Order of Merit winner.   It would be a fantastic season for him, and I'm sure it would be one that he'd remember for the rest of his life.   Like I said, he's playing great golf.   You can't fault the guy.   All I can do is try and play good, and I haven't played good enough.   He's played better, and he deserves it.
