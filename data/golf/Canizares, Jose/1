JOSÃ CANIZARES: Came here, obviously after a month off, always you don't know how your game is going to react to the competition.  I was hitting it quite well but then I felt on the golf course that that really didn't matter, because I started missing a lot of fairways the first day.  But my putting was really good this week.  Can't complain because my putting was really good pace and short putts, that's what I think kept me going.   
Today, a pity in the end I couldn't make a couple more but it was a lot of if un.   
 Q.  There was a moment when it looked very close to the top.  
JOSÃ CANIZARES: Yeah, but I wasn't feeling very confident with my driver and I was missing a lot of fairways.  I wasn't playing the golf that I should have been playing to contend I think, but in the end, it's a great finish for me to start the year with.   
 Q.  Is it important to start a year like this; does it give you the confidence, the momentum, the impetus to carry on?  
JOSÃ CANIZARES: Yeah, it's great to start obviously.  The better it start, the better it feels.  It's a pleasure to come over here in the winter and the weather is perfect.  The golf courses are as good as they can be, and it's a great three weeks for us and this tournament to start with is one of the best of the year I would say.
