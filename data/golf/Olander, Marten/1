MARTEN OLANDER:  I think this is the best day in England that I have ever experienced. It was crisp and cold in the morning, front inlayed a little longer but as the day warmed up it started to get shorter. The course is in great shape.

I couldn't remember when we were last here so I had to ask Stenson when he won and knew we came back twice after that. It's a fun course. There are a lot of good courses in Birmingham.

I just tried to play a simple game today, play for the middle of the greens. The greens are quite soft so you could be aggressive with a short iron in your hands, 8-irons, 9-irons. And I took advantage of the par 5s. That is the key, get in a good position. And the putter was acting nicely today.
