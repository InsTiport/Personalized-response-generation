MARTEN OLANDER:  It was a little bit of a tough start.  Took a little while to get into the rhythm of things but stayed committed.  Me and my caddie said one shot at a time today, especially on a windy day like this.
Q.  Was the wind a big factor at start of the day for you?
MARTEN OLANDER:  Maybe a little bit in my rhythm.  The thing that is tricky around here is the wind at Wentworth.  We just kept plugging away and yeah, we played good.  We played good.
Q.  Did you notice all of the guys coming back on the leaderboard?
MARTEN OLANDER:  No.  I actually noticed it on 12, or on 11, that a few of the leaders had dropped a few shots, but that's still early and I had to take care of my own game first.  So whatever happens, happens.  But I'm pleased with my finish.  I played solidly from 8 and on so that was fine.
Q.  And right in contention now.
MARTEN OLANDER:  Absolutely.
Q.  Your thoughts on tomorrow?
MARTEN OLANDER:  Just go out and play as good as I can and see where it leads to.
Q.  The one shot at a time mantra?
MARTEN OLANDER:  Yeah, that's my mantra for the week.  If I can keep that tomorrow, maybe I can give myself a good chance.
