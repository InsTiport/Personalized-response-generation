Q: Can you tell us about this round?
HA NA JANG: I think I had an all-around solid round from my tee shots to putting. There was a mistake on 16, but I'm thinking that will help my game tomorrow. So I'm satisfied with today.
Q: This is the first LPGA tour event in Busan? Any thoughts?
HA NA JANG: I have only good memories when it comes to Busan and I've always played quite well too. And as you know there are a lot of good eats here too. So this is a place where you can really get an energy boost especially with all the good food.
Q: What do you find most memorable about this event?
HA NA JANG: When you think of the people of Busan, they are known to be bold and really supportive. And so the gallery here and I are a good fit. So much so I think that is the reason I play so well in Busan. So I would say the gallery is the most memorable.
Q: You are known for your showmanship and for the different ways you celebrate a win. Do you know how you will celebrate this time if you win?
HA NA JANG: That's true but it has always been a surprise. So I hope you look forward to what you might see tomorrow.
