Q. It's been a while since we've seen you.  How does it feel to be back and playing in the States?
HA NA JANG: It's feels really comfortable because it's like almost six month ago my last tournament in U.S.
So it's comfortable, but sometimes too much thinking my score, something other player.
But I'm so happy, yep.
Q. What was working so well?  You were 6-under.
HA NA JANG: Yeah, 6-under.  It's like free bogey round today.  So happy.
Yeah, just be patient every hole.  Was really good shot on the second shot or something, like on the green, on the fairway.
Yeah, was really happy day.
Q. Have you been able to catch up with some friends out here that maybe you hadn't seen?
HA NA JANG: Danielle Kang, she's really close my friend.  She said, Welcome back Ha Na.  It's like Danielle, Michelle, or the Korean players say, Welcome back.
I'm some happy.  Yeah, uh-huh.
Q. What are your goals for the weekend?  You're going to be right up near the top of the leaderboard.
HA NA JANG: Oh, yeah.  Really good round in the second round, so I'm just be patient every day.  It's like I hope so 60 like something the score, 69 every day, some free bogey play.
My target is 15 under par for the four round, so just think about my target.
