Q.   So congratulations on your round today.   Just take me through it, if you will.
MARGHERITA RIGON:   I played very, very good.   I struggled a bit with my driver today, didn't hit many fairways, but thanks to my putts, it was quite easy to manage a good score.

Q.   Heading into the tournament what were your expectations when you arrived?
MARGHERITA RIGON:   I was struggling a bit this year, so I'm like on the 83rd position on the exemption ranking to keep my card on tour.   But I didn't want to put much pressure on me, so I didn't want to play to make the cut.   I just wanted to play to enjoy and stay in the present, and I think it's the best tournament of the year, with the weather hot, so just have fun on the course.

Q.   So you think the key was entering the tournament more relaxed?
MARGHERITA RIGON:   Yeah.   Not worry about the result, but just enjoying every shot and stay in the present.   That's the only difference.

Q.   And you're currently two off the lead.
MARGHERITA RIGON:   Yes.

Q.   Where do you think you can go from here?   Tomorrow what's the plan?
MARGHERITA RIGON:   I don't want to make any plan, because I just want to go out and have fun, so as long as I have fun, I don't care if I shoot 3â€‘under or three over.   I just want to feel good on the course.   That's the key point for me.

Q.   To stay relaxed and hopefully today will be repeated.
MARGHERITA RIGON:   Yes.   Of course. 

Q.   About the putts, do you know how many putts you had?
MARGHERITA RIGON:   26.

Q.   And yesterday?
MARGHERITA RIGON:   31.

Q.   So that was the difference, just the putting?
MARGHERITA RIGON:   Yeah.   I didn't hit as many greens as yesterday, so of course, they were shorter than yesterday, the putts I hit. 
But since last week I was playing very good, too.   I played in India, but my putt wasn't that good.   And just relaxing a bit more just to feel the pressure of my hands is really good.   So hopefully it's going to stay with me for two more days.
