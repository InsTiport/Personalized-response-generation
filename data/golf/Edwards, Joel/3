 Q.   It LOOKS like one guy is playing a different golf course than everybody else is.   
JOEL EDWARDS:   Pretty much, yeah, it really does.   But you get to making some putts out here and hitting it on the right side of the hole, it's there.   But if you don't hit it on the right side of the hole, you're going to struggle.   You're working overtime just to make par.   
   
 Q.   And you shoot what, 2‑under and the gap between you and him is wider?  
JOEL EDWARDS:   That's okay.   I mean that's wait it works.   I wish it was me, but it's not.   So you try your best and you never know.   
   
 Q.   He's avoiding those sharks.   
JOEL EDWARDS:   He must be, man.   He is.   Every one of them.   Because they're out there.   They're out there.   I just hope I don't see any of them.   
   
 Q.   Did the course, you had a different wind today, right?  
JOEL EDWARDS:   The third different wind.   It's unbelievable.   
   
 Q.   South, north, and now east?  
JOEL EDWARDS:   And early this morning it was really blowing and then it calmed down and then backed off for a while and then at the end it blew again.   
So you really don't know.   This is Lake Michigan, right?   We don't have a lake like this back home.   You never know what's going to come off that thing.   So it could be anything.   So hopefully it will be ‑‑ you just got to play your game, see what happens.   It's going to be tough.   I know that.
