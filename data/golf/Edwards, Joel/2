Q.   Talk about how the course is playing out there today. 
JOEL EDWARDS:   Well, in my opinion it's playing really hard.   I think it's playing, just playing so hard.   Not a whole lot of margin for error because kind of the slopes where they had the pins today, kind of behind some slopes and stuff like that.   And you really got to be ‑‑ it's a ball striking day, if you can get one. 

Q.   What's the difference between today and yesterday out there?
JOEL EDWARDS:   Well, for me rain.   I would say rain and, not really rain, but a little windier yesterday.   But it was a kind of downwind on the holes that it needed to be and, but it's just a hard course.   It doesn't take a lot to make a mistake out there.

Q.   So you happy through 36 where you're sitting?
JOEL EDWARDS:   I am.   As of yesterday I was a little disappointed the way I finished, but I'm really happy today getting something in the 60s is pretty good.
