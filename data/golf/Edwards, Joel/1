Q.   Talk about your round a little bit.   I know you had birdies on 7, 11, 13. 
JOEL EDWARDS:   Yeah.   It was a weird day.   I just I think I 3‑putted on No. 6, but I hit it from 90 feet, so it's not really the putter's fault.   But I also 2‑putted from 90 feet twice. 
So it was a good day.   It could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse.

Q.   The course change after the rain or how much did it?   Did you get any mud balls or anything?
JOEL EDWARDS:   No.   No.   There was a little bit, but nothing ‑‑ it wasn't bad at all.   It's there, it's just a hard course.   It's just hard. 

Q.   Looks like you're going to be right around the Top‑10.   What are your thoughts going into tomorrow now?
JOEL EDWARDS:   It's exciting.   So have a good round tomorrow and that would be a lot of fun.   So that's what you're looking for is to play as solid as you can.

Q.   Do you have a number in mind?
JOEL EDWARDS:   No.   No.   You just got to play good.   If you play good, it will pay for itself.
