 Q.  How do you assess your week here?  How did you feel throughout the tournament?  Were you nervous or were you able to concentrate on the play?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: Well, I was quite nervous, actually, because I feel like I still don't realize that I won a tournament, so I have all this attention before before I had none.  I was able to still manage -- but I will be able to manage, to do it later on.  Yeah, I was quite nervous at the beginning, but now, I just enjoy the tournament, because it's a really fun one.   
 Q.  First time here in Dubai?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: First time in Dubai, it's really fun.   
 Q.  What does it mean to you to win Rookie of the Year?  Pretty big accolade.  A lot of very top, good players have won that over the years.  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: Well, I'm very excited.  It means that I reached some of my goals, and I'm very happy with how I improved this year, and I'm very excited to see what 2018 has for me.   
 Q.  What are you going to do for Christmas?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: I'm going to ski, after Christmas, but before, we're going to Miami with my family because my brother is playing in this tournament in Miami, so I'm going there.  But I think I'm going to chill.  I don't know if I'm going to play.   
 Q.  What's the name of the tournament?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: I can't remember what it's called, this tournament in Miami.  I think it was called the Orange Bowl but now it's called something else, but I really cannot remember.   
 Q.  About the year as a whole, can you believe that you had such a good rookie year?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: Yes, I had a great rookie year.  It was really awesome.  I played really good golf.  At the end of the year, I played good golf.  At the beginning of the year, it was quite hard, but that's okay.  It was a great year and I learned so many, and I'm so excited for next year.   
 Q.  A bit more information about you as a person.  You told me if you weren't going to become a professional golfer, you will start your own business in energy.  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: Yes.   
 Q.  So why did you want to do that?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: Because I have a few ideas, but I'm not going to tell you the ideas.   
 Q.  So maybe in the future you will continue with that idea?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: Yes, for sure.  I think it's going to be actually pretty good.  I mean, everybody says that.  Everybody has ideas.  But I think my ideas, I think they could be good, if I just get some fund-raising and stuff.  I think it will work, I'm pretty sure.   
 Q.  So you're going to be a businesswoman, as well and play golf?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: Yes, after.  After I will have some money with golf, after that I will have enough money to raise my business, so I will raise my business.  That's the plan.   
 Q.  How much do you need?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: I don't know.  Probably a few thousand.  But it's okay.  I'm on a good track.   
 Q.  Did you enjoy the year, the first year on Tour?  
CAMILLE CHEVALIER: I did.  I think the Tour is real fun.  People here are really nice, and it just feels like a big family, and the atmosphere is really fun.  I didn't expect that.  I expect that people are going to be just like LPGA has.  I heard kind of like, not very nice to each other.  But here, people are super nice to each other.   
So it's really cool.  I'm very happy to be here and I'm very honoured to be part of this tour.
