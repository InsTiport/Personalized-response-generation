WHEE KIM: I shot 3-under, not 4-under?
Q. You shot 3-under.  This is the first time you've broken 70 around here.  What did you learn?
WHEE KIM: Hit 3-wood off the tee.  Try to focus on hitting the fairway.  Wind blew hard this morning and cold, was like 50 degrees and blew 20 miles, sometimes gust 25 miles.  Feels like 40 degrees in the morning.
It's cold and then it was also hard to control the distance because it was cold and windy.  But I thought I have more chance to hit more greens and have more short putts to make the birdie or par if I can hit more fairways.  Just focus on hit the fairway.
I think I did pretty good.
Q. Looked like your short game was working pretty well, got it up and down --
WHEE KIM: Yeah.
Q. Good number of total putts, too by the looks of it.
WHEE KIM: I think I did pretty good around the green, too.  Just one miss on No. 13, par 3.  Left side of the green, little over, little short, and made a two-putt.  Was still good putt but just missed it.  So, without that it was good.
