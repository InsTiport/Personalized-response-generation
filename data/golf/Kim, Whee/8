 Q.  17-under, with the way you finished last night and today, you have to be feeling good about the week?  
WHEE KIM: It was a really nice finish this week, and then I expect a better week next week.  I think I had a really good start to get into next week.  I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  What do you feel most comfortable this week in terms of your game?  Has anything been coming around for you?  
WHEE KIM: Actually I changed my putting style.  I used to play the right-hand-low but this week I played left-hand-low, so it was the first week to play the left-hand-low.  It was a little strange, but I got used to it right after two days, earlier this week, after Tuesday.   
So I felt really comfortable with the left-hand-low.  Felt a little more stable.  So I think the putting was really good this week.   
 Q.  And how big is it for you, the finish here, to get in next week, to keep building on your momentum?  
WHEE KIM: Actually I really need to play one more top three or top five to get into the 150.  I don't know, just trying to do my best, that's it.
