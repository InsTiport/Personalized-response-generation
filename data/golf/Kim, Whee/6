Q. Great effort today to get into this playoff.  Obviously, it didn't turn out the way you wanted.  Give me a couple thoughts on how you played today?
WHEE KIM: Well, I was struggling for putting this morning for the first time.  Made a birdie on the 1st, and I thought it was a really good start, and it was all par through the No. 9.  Had a good turning point on No. 10, and made a birdie.  Then made another birdie on No. 12.
So I thought it's going to be a really good turning point.  So I made a couple more birdies there.  I thought really -- I thought I had a really good chance.  But, it's okay.  I finished second.  Still second or third start of the season, it's okay.  I'm happy.  Congrats to Patrick.
Q. Absolutely.  How hard did this 18th hole play, both in regulation and in the playoff?
WHEE KIM: Oh, it was brutally tough.  Yesterday I thought I hit a pretty solid drive and it goes a little bit to the right.  It flew only like 250 to the pin, but I think it was like 230.  I had 4-iron into the rough, so it flew up in the air and went in the water.  So today was like the same.  Hit a little better shot, but it was really tough to hit more left.  The pin was left to right, so I had to hit really aggressively to the pin.  But if you push a little bit, it's going to turn over to the right.
But I thought I had a really good flop shot on the 1st, the regular 18 hole.  I thought I had a chance to make a par, hit it a little short.  But for the first playoff hole, I had a similar situation, tried to hit the same shot, it goes a little short.  So made a good two-putt, but it's tough.  It's tough out there.  The wind is blowing, and it's really tough.  But I did really good all week.
