ROBERT GAMEZ:  No, I'm disappointed about that bogey on the last hole.  I drove it in the fairway and it was kind of a little funky lie in the fairway or something and it squirted right on me and went in that bunker.  I just wasn't expecting that bunker shot to come out that hot.  I made bogey, but that's better than double.
Q.  All told, how do you feel about the round and how do you feel it was compared to the other guys?
ROBERT GAMEZ:  You know, I played really solidly today.  I only missed two greens.  I don't think that I missed very many fairways if I missed any.  I rolled it well.  I didn't make a whole lot.  I missed a really short one on 7, hit a good 4-iron about six feet and missed it.

I made a couple but I left a bunch out there.
Q.  All told, this is a pretty good tournament if Jose Coceres wasn't out there blowing away the field.  How do you approach it on Sunday?
ROBERT GAMEZ:  Hopefully he can't keep that pace up and I can shoot a low one tomorrow and catch him.  The golf course is playing really easy I thought, over the week, because it's so soft.  The fairways are wide out here, which is all right because it's a fairly long golf course.  The rough is up but it's kind of hard to get into it unless you really hit a bad shot.

All in all, the greens are perfect.  They're rolling pretty smooth overall.  The ball is stopping right next to the hole.
Q.  Given the fact that course record scores are close to that being shot this week, what kind of confidence do you have that this will be an absolute shootout?
ROBERT GAMEZ:  It's going to be fun tomorrow.  I know I'm going to go out tomorrow firing and see what happens.

I'm due to get a real low one going.  I've had three pretty steady rounds.  I'm due for a low one.
