 Q.  Fantastic win, great to get some points on the board, can you give me your thoughts?  
JACK MCDONALD: It was just an unbelievable experience.   Me and Cormac played awesome we didn?t really miss a shot and we holed great putts at the right time to keep the momentum going.     
We were just right up for it.   The way we were striking the ball it would have been difficult for anyone to beat us out there.     
Heading into the back nine we had a healthy lead and we just kept putting pressure on them and just didn?t let up we kept putting it on the fairway then on the green and that?s all you can really do.     
 Q.  Do you think the conditions helped this morning?  
JACK MCDONALD: With the overnight rain the course is a lot different to what it has been in practice which has softened it up a bit.   We are more used to the conditions compared the American guys.   
 Q.  What will you do this afternoon?  
JACK MCDONALD: It will be great to go out and be inside the ropes and support the guys out there.   It?s a big day tomorrow so will rest up this afternoon.
