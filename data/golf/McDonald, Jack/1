Q. What kind of fight did these American boys put up today?
JACK McDONALD: They put up a great fight. They came straight back with it. We got four up through six and then they birdied seven, eight and nine to get it back to 1, so it was really, really good golf right through the game.
CORMAC SHARVIN: When the guys got it back to all square obviously we were going to be up against it on the way in. We just stuck to our game plan and played conservatively and kept making pars and not dropping shots and that?s the key to our game the last few days.
Q. How positive is this looking for the home side now?
JACK McDONALD: It?s looking good, we just need to go out and control every shot and see how it pans out at the end of the day.
Q. Huge crowds today, what?s it doing for you out there?
CORMAC SHARVIN: My hands feel like lead. It?s a great buzz, when you hit a good shot you get a big roar, so when you?re standing in front of a shot you hope you get a good one. It?s nice.
