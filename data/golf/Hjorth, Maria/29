  Q.  Talk about your round today and the last few days.   
 MARIA HJORTH:  Well, I was hitting well off the tee.  I just had a few iron shots that wasn't as good as I've been hitting them the other few days.  You know, then you miss the green and don't get up-and-down.  That's pretty much what the difference was really.   
  
  Q.  Was there a turning point or was there a shot that you hit that you would like to have back?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  No, I don't think so.  I mean, it was still pretty tight out there.  It was, you know, a couple of holes towards the end but it wasn't really a shot that I would like to have back or anything like that.  It was pretty close, though.   
  
  Q.  Interesting seeing your game against Ai's game, where she just pecks and away and pecks away.   
 MARIA HJORTH:  You know that about Ai's game.  She's always going to be very solid.  She's very straight off the tee and hits a lot of greens and, you know, that's going to be her game, so you just have to make birdies to win some holes and I didn't make enough of them today.   
  
  Q.  Did you miss a lot of greens today with your irons?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  I missed a few more than I did the last few days.  But you know, not that big of a deal really.   
  
  Q.  Still a good run for you here heading back to Europe for the next few tournaments?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  Yeah, I'm still happy with the way I'm playing.  I just have to keep on grinding and hopefully I can take on the third place in the afternoon.
