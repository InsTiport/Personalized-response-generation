  Q.  Talk about playing this afternoon.   
 MARIA HJORTH:  What can you do, I shot 3- or 4-under this afternoon.  That's match play for you.   
  
  Q.  Took you a while to get going early on?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  No, I feel pretty good already from the start.  It wasn't too bad at all.  She is a very solid player and she doesn't make many mistakes, so you just have to keep on grinding and I did, but it wasn't enough.   
  
  Q.  This isn't a situation where you see too much, playing without a chance to hold up a trophy; is it hard to get yourself back in there after the morning round?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  No, I don't think so.  You're still playing for third or fourth.  Of course, it's always nice to walk away with a win rather than a loss, but you're still out there fighting.   
  
  Q.  Is that what you rely on, your competitive spirit just to push you through the round?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  Absolutely.   
  
  Q.  Did your caddie give you a pep talk going out there?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  Of course.  We're both going out there to win it and, you know, you just have to kick it into gear.  I tried, but she had a lot of birdies.   
  
  Q.  On 17, to short-side yourself like that, and to almost hole it out, is that indicative of the way you're playing, the save and recovery shots?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  I think a bit.  But I actually have been very unlucky with a lot of lies this week.  Even here on 18, instead of being flat in the bunker, you're up against the back with a downhill lie when you have to hit a high bunker shot and it's almost impossible.  I've had a lot of those lies this week, which has been one of them weeks.  I guess you get some bad breaks every now and then, and that's what happens.    
 Overall, I'm very happy with the way I've been playing.
