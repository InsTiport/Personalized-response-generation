 Q. Great round out there, you put yourself in contention, what was going right for you today in putting two rounds like this? What does that mean going into the weekend? 
 MARIA HJORTH: Well, scrambling a little bit. I'm not hitting my driver as well as I would like to actually. Going to go work on that a little bit. 
 When the driver is in the fairway, I'm hitting my irons really well and I have a lot of birdie chances. So taking advantage of that a little bit, and not made too many mistakes. And that's where you kind of need to try to stay away from on this course and try to, you know, stay with your pars, that's pretty important.

 Q. You seemed pretty relaxed, but everyone talks about the added pressure; do you put added pressure on yourself at a major, or do you come into it like any golf tournament you're trying to win?
 MARIA HJORTH: I really try to come into it like any other tournament. I know I've done that in the past, put too much effort, trying to work too hard Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, but I took Monday off and just kind of had a light workout and played Pro-Ams Tuesday, Wednesday. And so I feel fresh and ready when I come into the event rather than stress myself out.


 Q. Does your strategy change for the weekend when the course starts to get tougher and play a little differently?
 MARIA HJORTH: We'll have to see. It seems like the greens are firming up a little bit, and maybe you have to play a little bit more safe on the greens and more for the middle of the greens, rather than go for the pins. We'll just have to see what the weather does and if the greens dry out a little bit.
