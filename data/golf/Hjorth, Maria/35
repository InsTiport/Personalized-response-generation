Q.  Talk about the round.  The back nine at 4 under today, just playing as well as you could back there?
MARIA HJORTH:  I did.  I was hitting it really good.  And I hit a lot of greens too, even on the front.  But they didn't really drop.  On the back nine I got a few to drop.  So it's really good, it's a really solid round, probably one of the best rounds I've had this year.
Q.  You're one of the first ones in with a good score, so just tell us how the course is playing.
MARIA HJORTH:  It's playing fairly soft.  I guess they had a little bit of rain last night.  So the greens are pretty receptive.  You can pretty much shoot at the pin and it sits there.

But, yeah, everything is playing good.  You still have to definitely keep it on the fairway.  The rough is a bit thick today just because of the rain and the wet conditions.

So it's still playing really good.
Q.  Three birdies in a row to start the back.  Kind of walk us through that stretch.
MARIA HJORTH:  Yeah.  I hit a very good drive on the 10th, so I had about 87 yards to the pin.  So I hit it, I hit it up to maybe six feet and made the putt.

Then on the 11th, I hit a good 3 wood off the tee and a 4 iron layup and then I hit a very good third shot to just a few inches.

And then on the 12th I hit an 8 iron to about 12 feet and made the putt.
Q.  How much confidence does it give you overnight knowing that whatever happens this afternoon you'll be one of the lower rounds of the day?
MARIA HJORTH:  Yeah, just the confidence of playing well and really trusting myself out there, that's really what I'm going to try to take and keep for tomorrow, whether I'm lying 10th or lying first or whatever it is.  I just feel very confident with my round today and that's what I need to bring to the course tomorrow.
