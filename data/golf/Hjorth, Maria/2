 Q. Hard luck on the defeat. What are your initial thoughts?
 MARIA HJORTH: I made a few little mistakes on a few holes, and she played well. She played solid. She made more birdies than I did, and that's really the difference.

 Q. How much did the weather interruptions affect your game? 
 MARIA HJORTH: I don't think it affected it too much. I came out playing better after the break so, to me it didn't really make that much of a difference.

 Q. Did the weather have a big effect on the course today? Was it a harder course to play with all the wind and the rain? 
 MARIA HJORTH: The wind is definitely hard. The rain I don't think made too big a difference. Everything is wet anyway, the greens and the fairways from before. So I don't think that made a difference. But the wind was really strong.

 Q. Looking at the scoreboard now, what are your thoughts for the rest of the afternoon? 
 MARIA HJORTH: Well, it's going to be very tight. It's going to come down to the last few matches there. 
 So, you know, we have to go out there and pump our girls up.

 Q. Do you have any thoughts on the Cristie Kerr situation and her injured wrist? 
 MARIA HJORTH: Well, what can you say? If she's injured, she's injured. There is not much to do about it. You know, obviously, she hurt it really bad otherwise she would have played. Not much you can say about it.

 Q. Your thoughts on your overall Solheim? How do you think you played? 
 MARIA HJORTH: I've been playing solid, I think. I had a few maybe little mistakes that cost a hole here and there. But, overall, I've been playing well, so I can't be too disappointed.
