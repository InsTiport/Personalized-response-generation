  Q.  How is the course?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  I was driving well today, keeping it on the fairway, used a lot of 3-woods, but no worries.  I like being on this course, and I hit a lot of irons, three birdies.   
  
  Q.  Could you talk more about the course today as opposed to earlier in the week?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  I think it's toughening up, because the greens are better today.  I played Tuesday in the Pro-Am, and they were softer then than they are now, and that makes a difference because you have to carry the ball a lot different than you had to the other day.   
 I think it makes it hard, and of course if you have a few shots that you carry a little too far, you go over the back and you have a trickey shot coming down.  So if you play it safe then you're working toward par.   
  
  Q.  What do you think it's going to play like for the next three days?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  I hope they keep the greens firm like they are now.  I like it when the greens are firm, and it is a Major, so it will be tough.  I hope it stays like this.  If you make par, you'll have a good score.
