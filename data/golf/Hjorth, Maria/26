 Q.  Maria, Annika, that was a great escape, wasn't it? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It was.  We were down most of the way.  I had a great partner today.  She played very, very well.  I had a few good moments out there.  I thought it was tough -- rain, wind, cold.  It doesn't get much harder than this, I don't think. 

 Q.  Give the people at home a sense of how tough it was, because I thought it was brutal. 
 MARIA HJORTH:  It was.  It's difficult on this course because if you keep the ball a little bit lower, the wind doesn't affect the ball that much.  You get the ball maybe five yards further up in the trees, it's going off. 
 Really, really difficult.  Especially makes it hard with the cold weather, too, and it's almost like we had four seasons in one day here. 

 Q.  Are you looking forward to foursomes in the morning, either of you? 
 MARIA HJORTH:  Absolutely, yeah, yeah.  We're ready to go again today and get some points. 

 Q.  It's a great escape.  Another half point.  It looked very grim at one stage.  Do you think that's important for morale? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's been a long day for everybody.  We've been fighting really well.  It seems like we haven't gotten off to the greatest start in the matches, but we were trying to start and hanging on.  Just a few matches we turned around.  Hopefully we can get another one or at least half. 

 Q.  Congratulations.  Been a long day.  I wish you a nice rest this evening.  You came down the stretch from behind and finished up even.  That's really an important half point right there? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  You're right.  We were down most of the match, I would say all of it maybe, and we just fought really, really hard.  We never gave up.  I mean, we tried.  In the end, we had some good golf despite the conditions.  Maria and I complimented each other well.  She played better than I did.
