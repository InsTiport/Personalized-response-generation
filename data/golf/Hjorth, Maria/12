  Q. Sorry to see your ball in the water on 18. Can you talk us through what happened there?   
 MARIA HJORTH: I hit a really good drive, and second shot was a perfect 4-iron. Hit it maybe a little bit heavy. But I think wind was maybe a little bit stronger as well, and you kind of expect it but obviously went in the water, but I took a drop. But a perfect yardage and hit a shot, for some reason, the wind is just so much stronger obviously than I thought and it came up short and spun back again.   
 So that's how it is. Of course, it's disappointing to finish off like that, because I played pretty solid again all day today. Just didn't make as many putts as I did yesterday. So we'll see. There's still two rounds to go.  
  
  Q. Do you feel that you can recover and get back out there?  
 MARIA HJORTH: Yeah, definitely. I'm playing well enough. It's just one of them little mishaps that happened and you know, it's just unfortunate that it does. You know, just have to go on and move forward.  
  
  Q. What was the strongest part of the game today? You seemed to be pretty consistent, except for the last hole. You would have been once again on top of the leaderboard?  
 MARIA HJORTH: Yeah, my tee shots were really good, and I think my irons have been pretty solid, as well. Today I didn't putt as good as I did yesterday.   
 So the putting is still -- a little bit so-so today. But I think overall, place the ball in some good places on the fairways.  
  
  Q. Anything you plan to change for tomorrow?  
 MARIA HJORTH: No. I'm playing well and I just have to go out there and just be aggressive and make a lot of birdies.   
  
  Q. Is it going to be on your mind tomorrow, the 18th?  
 MARIA HJORTH: No, you have to leave it and that's how it is. I can't change it. You have to just go on tomorrow.
