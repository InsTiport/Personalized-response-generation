  Q. Was it tougher than you thought? You got off to a blistering start.   
 MARIA HJORTH: We got off to a very, very good start but then just didn't make any putts after that. All of a sudden they make three birdies in a row and we lose three in a row.   
  
  Q. How difficult is it to get back into the game when they start making birdies?   
 GWLADYS NOCERA: You just have to focus on your own game. The Americans, there is nothing you can do about how they are playing, so all you have to do is take care of your own game.  
  
  Q. How do you stay focused? This crowd is so supportive of the Americans.   
 MARIA HJORTH: Well, you really just have to start making putts. If you make putts they get a little bit quieter, so that's how you've got to pump yourself up to make sure they stay as quiet as you can. That's all you can do really, and just try not to listen to them too much.  
  
  Q. You're both playing this afternoon. You're playing with Anna Nordqvist. Are you looking forward to that?  
 MARIA HJORTH: I am actually. She played really well yesterday, and there's no question she was playing well this morning, so hopefully we can go out there and kick off the game.
