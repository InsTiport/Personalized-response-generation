 Q. Tell us about the day?
 MARIA HJORTH: Obviously it was a very good day. Played solid. Played solid yesterday as well, but it was so windy and cold yesterday morning, so it was tough scoring. 
 Today I mean, it's still tough out there. The greens are fairly firm and you have to hit good tee shots to have a chance to make birdie. So I made a few today, so that was good. 

 Q. Is the wind maybe the difference between yesterday and today being that you played well both days? 
 MARIA HJORTH: Definitely, definitely. It was a little bit easier to place the ball today. 
 Yesterday, you're just trying to get it as good as you could. So it was definitely a difference, yeah.

 Q. Glad to be in before sundown? 
 MARIA HJORTH: Yeah, very Happy. I thought we were on the bubble actually. But we actually managed it with probably 15 minutes to go. Yeah, happy to be done.

 Q. Need to double-check but I think your 68 is the best round of the day, and yesterday's best was 67. So surprised at that? 
 MARIA HJORTH: Well, a bit of both. The greens are really, really tricky, especially on the back nine. It's not easy to score around here. I mean, I was hoping for shooting under par today, and I knew that was going to put me up there anyway and going in for a good round tomorrow. 
 Obviously shooting 4-under makes it even better. You really have to be patient out here, because you're going to have some bad breaks and you're going to get some good breaks, too. 

 Q. There's a three-shot gap between Amy and the rest of the field right now. On a course like this, is three shots all that much? 
 MARIA HJORTH: No, we have 36 holes to go, and I don't think it's much at all. It's so easy to all of a sudden make a couple of bogeys or even a double-bogey. I'll go out there and see what I can do tomorrow.
