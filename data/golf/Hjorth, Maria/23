 Q.  Your first Solheim Cup match.  1-down with two to play.  You get a half. 
 LINDA WESSBERG:  It's great.  Maria played really good on the last hole.  I saved a par on 17, so great. 

 Q.  Captain's pick, unbeaten in four matches.  Can't be better than that, can it? 
 MARIA HJORTH:  No, can't really.  I'm still happy with the way the team has been going and the way I've been playing, and Linda and I get to out there, again, really fight to go win.  That's really all it is. 

 Q.  Looking forward to this afternoon, Cristie Kerr in Match 11, how do you feel about that? 
 MARIA HJORTH:  Feels great.  I'm very excited. 

 Q.  Match 10, where it comes down to, did you put your hand up for that one? 
 LINDA WESSBERG:  No, I didn't.  They picked me, or I don't know, but, you know, we'll just have to go out, and I'm playing Paula and she's playing great.  It's good to be a very good match. 

 Q. Fabulous play today.  Well done.
