Q.  Seeing all the red on the leaderboard definitely had to be a little discouraging for you guys?
MARIA HJORTH:  It wasn't too bad actually.  You have to go out there and do your own thing and play your own match.
Q.  How was it playing with Natalie and the crowds out here today?
MARIA HJORTH:  It was good.  It's so much fun with all the spectators.  I mean, you can't complain.
