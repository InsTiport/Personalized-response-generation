  Q.  What about your game today?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  I had a good game today.   
  
  Q.  The weather?  Is it disrupting you, the wind?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  It's hard, but it's hard for everybody.  So you just have to say hang in there and work hard and, you know, try to make as few mistakes as you can.  It's hard.   
  
  Q.  You're leading right now.  What do you think about tomorrow?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  Well, we have to go and see.  We have to keep up -- keep it going, and, you know, hopefully we can get all the points going out there on the board.  It will be great.   
  
  Q.  What about the audience?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  The spectators are great.  It's really, really good.  I mean, it's amazing how many people stayed out this late.  It's great.
