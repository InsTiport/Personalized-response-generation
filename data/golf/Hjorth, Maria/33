 Q.  Just talk about that marathon match.  How was that for you, five extra holes? 
 MARIA HJORTH:  Yeah, it was pretty long.  I mean, we both played pretty solid.  I thought I played really well all day, but none of us made anything.  That's really what it came down to.  You know, on the last, I got a pretty good break and for the ball to stay up and not go in the bunker, Catriona got in the bunker. 
 Overall it was a tough match.  I was 3-up, pretty quick, and then just made a few 3-putts and she got a few back.  It was a long day. 

 Q.  Talk about you were behind a tree and she was dead center in the fairway and you scrambled and got a par on the board.  Did that give you a bit of momentum? 
 MARIA HJORTH:  Absolutely.  Just getting the second shot through the trees, and I thought, well, if I can get it -- I was trying to get it in the bunker, and if I can get in the bunker and around that green, I probably can get up-and-down and hopefully make a par to go through. 
 So of course, that was an important thing.  And the hole after, I pulled my tee shot a little bit and hit a tree and got a good break.  But you've got to have good breaks every now and then. 

 Q.  I know you might not want to think ahead, but to win this thing there's probably 90 more holes to play and you just played 22; does that tax on your mental side of the game a little bit? 
 MARIA HJORTH:  No, it doesn't feel that way.  As long as you keep on playing well, you know, keep yourself in it and keep your focus; you know, now I'm going to go back and rest and get some energy for tomorrow. 
 But, you know, I'll come out ready tomorrow again.
