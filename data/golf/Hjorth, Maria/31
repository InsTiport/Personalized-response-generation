  Q.  Talk about that match and the final putt?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  The match, it was a really good match.  We both played solid.  Not many mistakes made out there and it was a really, really good match.   
 You know, it was one of those putts.  I had a good feeling about it and all of a sudden, it's in the hole.   
  
  Q.  About 45 feet?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  Yeah, probably about that.   
  
  Q.  Your game is really rounding into shape this week, you're grinding away and getting the key shots.  Talk about that and where does come from?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  Yeah, I've been playing really well the last two months actually, and I'm starting to get a little comfortable and seeing the low scores that I've been waiting for.  All of a sudden this week I'm grinding and trusting myself and it seems to go going well.   
  
  Q.  Ready for another 18?   
 MARIA HJORTH:  Yeah, absolutely.
