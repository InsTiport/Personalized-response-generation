Q. What was the difference today?
JON RAHM: The front nine, I felt good.  My putting wasn't just there.  A couple mistakes, again, following with yesterday, the mistakes were really costly my first 27 holes.  The back nine I just seemed to make every single putt I didn't make on the front nine.  I made a couple really good par putts on 11 and 13.  Played every par 5 basically really great.  I just took advantage of the opportunities.
Q. Two great scores this morning, and this afternoon seems your score of 68 will be one of the best scores of the afternoon.  You've played yourself nicely into contention.
JON RAHM: Yeah, the wind started picking up.  The front nine it was rather easy.  There was not much wind.  Obviously perfect conditions on the course.  Making birdies was almost a given.  Kind of flipped it.  Played a great back nine where the pins were a little more tucked in and the wind started being a big factor.
Again, I was probably one of the lucky few who was able to make a lot of putts on the back nine.
Q. How nice is it to be here, your first season sort of on The European Tour, coming here to Dubai, Top 60 in the world and playing in this great competition?
JON RAHM: I don't know how many times I've said it already this week, but again, turning what at the beginning of the year was a non-membership to an affiliate to becoming a Rolex Series Champion to getting here as fourth in The Race to Dubai after finishing great in the US, it's a huge honour to be honest.
Just to have the chance to maybe finish in the top three, my first year, when at first I really had no hopes of being here at this point.  So I'm just really glad to be here.  I'm really thankful.
Q. Another impressive round, 31 closing nine for you.  If you look back at your round, what would you say your strengths were today?
JON RAHM: Well, I did hit my driver really, really well.  But you know, each nine was different.  The front nine, I stroked the ball beautifully.  Couldn't make any putts.  On the back nine, I didn't strike it quite as good as I did on the front nine but I made the putts.  I made up making the putts.
To be honest I think it was my mental strength; to go from making a bogey on 8 with a 3-putt after hitting two great shots, missing a birdie putt on 9, yet another one on the front nine and kind of flipped the switch on the back nine and hit a perfect drive, perfect wedge and made a tap-in birdie.  I think that's the highlight and the strength today.
Q. You're playing the DP World Tour Championship for the very first time and seeing the golf course for the first time this week, as you have many times across the world, seen golf courses and played them after seeing them one time only.  Why are you such a quick learner, in your opinion, on golf courses?
JON RAHM: I don't know.  I can't tell you.  I really don't know.  Again, four years of college, when you only have one practice round and they try to make you play fast, only one shot into the green, one shot off the tee, a few putts; you really have to learn.  When you give me a full Pro-Am day, when you're going to see five people putt on the green and people hitting chips and how the ball reacts, you can end up learning a course pretty well.
To be honest, I don't know, I don't know what it is.  I guess I just got comfortable in playing places I don't know.  Been easily adaptable, I would call it, just try to be that way.
