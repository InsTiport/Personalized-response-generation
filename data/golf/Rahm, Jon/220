Q. Looks like you made the cut.  Did you come here expecting that?
JON RAHM: Yeah, yeah, I was in a good form.  After I was playing in the practice rounds, I was really confident about my chances.  Surely, my first round didn't reflect how good I felt.  But today was proof of it.
Q. It was basically two holes yesterday, right, that were the problem, more or less?
JON RAHM: Two shots, I would say.  Just the two bunker shots.  I really didn't hit many bad shots in the entire round.  It was just unfortunate to do what I did.
Q. When you were at 17 green, what's the mindset with that putt, knowing that you might be right on that cusp of making the cut?
JON RAHM: Honestly, my mind was so clear at that point.  I got into my own zone.  In my mind, there was no chance I was missing that putt.  I don't know what happened.  I can't explain it.  It just happened.  It's probably the best putt I've made in the last month.
Q. The only amateur to make the cut in the U.S. Open.  What does that mean to you?
JON RAHM: Am I the only one?
Q. Looks like it.
JON RAHM: I can say it's a huge, huge accomplishment.  Extremely honored to have done it, and it's kind of humbling to see how many great amateurs are playing here, almost national champion from Texas, Scottie Scheffler, played a great round; Charlie Danielson; Nick Hardy; U.S. amateur finalist, Derek Bard.  Just a lot of high quality golf, and to be the only one makes me realize how good of a day I had today.  I'm extremely proud of it.
Q. Nice way to cap your amateur career, I'm guessing?
JON RAHM: Still a day and a half of play, two more rounds.  Hopefully I can improve it a little bit.  It's a great way to do it, making the cut in the U.S. Open.
Q. The symbolism of what you're wearing today?
JON RAHM: Oh, yeah, big time.  Big time.  I put this on on purpose, knowing that if at any time I felt like anything was against me, I would look at my clothes and be like, What would Seve do?  That's what I did on 18, ended up with an up-and-down.  That's what I did on 9, when it was not the easiest lie on the bunker, and when I got the up-and-down.
It was mostly to help me keep my mind strong and hit it.  That's the whole purpose of putting it on today.
Q. Have you ever done that before?
JON RAHM: With the Spanish National Team, yeah, we used to have an outfit that was navy and a white shirt.
Q. How do you go from Spain to ASU?
JON RAHM: My dad literally dropped me off at the airport and said goodbye, son.  Let me know when you get there.  No, no, I was -- my dad always told me the future of golf, especially my future, would be coming to the States.  That's something really impressive to think, because not many Spanish players that were my age came or before that came.
He realized the future of the golf is in the States so you better go there.  If you don't like it, the worst that will happen is you can learn English.  Turned out great for me.  Had a great experience and became probably the best player I could be nowadays.
Q. That was your dad following you today, correct?  What does it mean to have his support going the entire way?  He dropped you off, but he's watching you side by side watching you make the cut today?
JON RAHM: Not only my dad.  I had my dad, my girlfriend, my brother, my mom, my teacher, my dad's best friend.  We have a group of 11 people, really good friends from my golf club.  Every time I hit a good shot they're yelling louder than anybody.  That makes me feel great.  Not only they came all the way here to see me.  But to make a cut for my parents, after graduating, is probably the most special thing I could do for them.  It's a really special moment, especially at Oakmont.
Q. Is that the first time your parents have seen you play in the States?
JON RAHM: No.  My dad watched me play in the U.S. Amateur at the Atlanta Athletic Club and Phoenix, Phoenix Open.  For my mom, the first time.
Q. What do you say to junior golfers watching the Open this weekend and knowing here's a college kid playing with the best pros in the world and basically, you made it.  What do you say to junior golfers to encourage them to follow your footsteps?
JON RAHM: The only thing I say to myself, pretty much every time I see something (indiscernible), nothing is impossible.  If you believe, you dream -- if you dream and believe you can do something, and you set your mind on it, you probably can accomplish it.
Q. How would you describe your recent stretch, the Hogan Award, the Nicklaus Award at Memorial, and now you make a U.S. Open cut after finishing off a career at the NCAA?
JON RAHM: I had almost forgotten about that.  Actually, all I can say is just how proud I am.  It's like a humbling process.  Even if I won all those things, I'm human and I shot 6 over yesterday.  So it helps that I have my esteem or my ego extremely high.  It makes me realize that I can have a future in this game.  It's nice to look back and see all what I've done.  It motivates me to keep working harder to keep on accomplishing things like that.
Q. You have a lot of people here, but not your coach.  Did you contact him yet?
JON RAHM: No.  My phone's in the bag still.  I'm sure he's watching.  I'm sure he already knows and he already texted me for sure.
Q. He went to a wedding?
JON RAHM: Yeah, he went to a wedding.  He was sad he couldn't be here.  Me too.  He told me if I was topping the leaderboard going into tomorrow, he might fly back.
Q. Are you going to be?
JON RAHM: Hopefully I am, yeah.
