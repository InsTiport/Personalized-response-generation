 Q.  Just how tough were those conditions out there today?  You look pretty exhausted.  
JON RAHM: Yeah, I mean, it's not easy, especially having to battle since the fifth hole.  4-under par on the five easiest holes on the course is losing too many shots.  At least I finished even par after that, which was a good day.   
But even though I had a good finish, it's more of the problem of starting poorly like I did.  Having to hold on for too long.   
 Q.  It looked like when things got difficult --  
JON RAHM: Even when I made that bogey on 5, it's just unlucky things that happened today to a lot of them.  You try to get one birdie in and hopefully get on a roll.  I knew -- I was thinking we need 5-under par total to finish in the top-10.  4-under made it, right?  So it wasn't too far out.   
If I had a decent finish, had not made that mistake on 17, maybe had a chance.   
But at the end of the day, finishing 9th, 11th, it doesn't matter.  It's not the greatest day.   
Too bad I had a rough start and never had a chance to get it going.  Still, at the same time I'm never going to give up no matter how bad it starts.   
 Q.  Can you summarize your tournament, the Championship.  
JON RAHM: I felt like I played three different tournaments at this point.  Started the front nine with a lead the first day, finished poorly.  The next day I start poorly, finished properly.  Yesterday good round overall.   
I will say this is proper Open Championship weather to become a champion.  You can say you truly became a champion on a perfect Open Championship Day.  Rain, wind, difficult.  Whoever gets to do it, they will be called a champion.   
It is what it is.  It's difficult to play like it was today.  But the first few days I played so good tee to green, I just couldn't take advantage of any putts I had.  That's why I was too far today without really a chance.
