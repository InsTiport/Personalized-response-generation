Q. 2-under 69; can we get some comments on your play?
JON RAHM:   Well, I played solid.  I didn't have the best start.  Was able to save that great par on 11.  Too bad that three-putt on 12, but after that, striped it.  I can't think of any tee shot really that was a bad miss.  Maybe the one at 6, but I was kind of aiming down the right half either way.  Great off the tee, great iron shots.  I just couldn't make them.  I could have hit a couple of them closer possibly.  I wish I would have.  But I just couldn't roll a couple of putts in.  I couldn't really get that going.  I was able to bring it back to 2-under par after 9 and kind of stalled a little bit on the way in.
Q. What's your mindset going in, 5-under par, a little ways back.  What will your mindset be?
JON RAHM:   Well, you've got to make the birdies.  Simple as that.  There's no room to be conservative in any way.  The greens are receptive and they're not as fast as they usually are, so if you're in the fairway and feeling good, take advantage of it and be aggressive.  Birdies are out there.  It's as simple as that.  There's no reason why I can't put two good scores on the weekend and give myself a chance.
