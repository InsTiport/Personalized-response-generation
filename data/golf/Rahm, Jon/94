  JON RAHM: Hitting it in the hosel is never fun, ended up in the trees, saved a great par. But that kind of shook me up a little bit.   
Even though I hit it to six feet on 9, I kind of shook on my whole body and I was never the same during the round.   
I was able to save, I mean the back nine was filled with par saves. Great putt on 11, 12, 14, 16, and 18, all of them 5 to 10 feet for par and then that's what happened today.   
Not that I'm feeling bad, I'm feeling really confident, a lot of good energy, it's just, you know, every miss out here is going to be costly most of the time today.  
   
 Q. How do you attack the weekend? You're right in position again just like you were last year.   
JON RAHM: I think I'm in better position than last year, I'm only two shots back. Hopefully, I hope the best off the tee and my irons the best is to come. Like I said, I'm feeling good, even that last shot on 18 it felt like a good swing, I might have been aiming wrong, it could be something as simple as that, who knows. But the whole body feels good and hopefully I can keep the Tournament the way it is and give myself a few better birdie looks.
