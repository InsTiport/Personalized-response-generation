Q. What's your overall assessment of the day and where you stand going into tomorrow?
JON RAHM: I can predict that question every time. I don't know, can't make a putt. If I could make a putt I would be happier, but six back, hitting it good, I just can't seem to roll it in and at this point it just seems like it's a little bit too far to be able to make it up. This course it isn't as easy to make up distance, this one is going to be hard, unless we get a really bad or windy day which I don't think is forecasted. So I'm going to need to do something very, very special for tomorrow otherwise my chances of winning are going to be low. But hopefully I can just focus and put in a good round, just play good golf and try to keep what I'm doing, get to the leader closer and make a couple putts. I'm close, every day has been the same story, the first few holes I haven't been giving myself the closest chances, I really didn't have that much of a chance, good putts that didn't go in and then when I hit it close I just simply couldn't make them. I just told Adam, the stretch of 11, 12, there's two short putts, making one would have made a huge difference -- and then obviously 17, right. So that would have made the two-shot swing that could have maybe changed things around or maybe kept me going in a better back nine. But that's what it is. So things are going good, definitely don't have my A game, but hopefully I can just keep working on it and just tinker with my game towards the rest of the season.
Q. Did we just see Tony Finau's A game out there?
JON RAHM: What kind of question is that? Yeah, he shot 9-under. What else do you expect? I mean, he shot almost a perfect 9-under. He missed two short putts that can be missed. I mean, he also made a lot of long ones, but -- and then the only tee shot that seems he missed was 18. He played amazing golf. I mean, it's one of those rounds where, yeah, you can think of those two short putts that he missed, but he made a couple other long ones on the way. And 9-under par, that's about as good as you can play out here.
Q. Do you feel like the being six back it would take something special to get back mostly because the guys in front of you, you don't expect any of them to not be a couple under themselves?
JON RAHM: Well, no, it's not only the guys leading it's the guys that are ahead of me themselves. It's going to be somebody that's going to come in and shoot 6-, 7-under tomorrow, it's just going to happen. If I do it I probably won't win. So if somebody is at 13 and shoots 16-, 17-, 18-, 19- under I'm going to have to get close to 20-under to win and it might not be enough.
