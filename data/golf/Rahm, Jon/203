Q. Keeping the body nice and relaxed and refreshed?
JON RAHM: I wouldn't say there was such thing as an easy way, when you have to make birdies to win holes.  I had a good day.  I hit the ball just as good as I did the other ways, but the difference was today I made the putts.
Q. The second hole.  You can find some tough putts on this course.  This was a tough putt?
JON RAHM: It was.  But I find those putts something I really like.
Q. So you win 9.  And then you get to 10.  You're on a good run through the turn and looking for something special with the wedge?
JON RAHM: I a the perfect distance, 117 meters.  52 degree wedge.  It was just the perfect distance.  I was able to execute the shot perfectly.
Q. The perfect number, the perfect shot.  And you found one more to close out the match?
JON RAHM: I got lucky.  It was again good distance.  Not the best angle but I had a 56 degree wedge.
Q. I saw you in the steak house last night.  What size steak did you have?  I will shock you.  You tell me yours first?
JON RAHM: I got the 16 ounce bone-in filet.
Q. So you had Paul McGinley's portion last night.  He's about half your size.  He went for the 22 ounce cowboy steak and all that was left was the bone.  Actually he was gnawing on it.
JON RAHM: I almost got the Tomahawk, but 40 ounces is too big.  I still have the steak in me today.  I would not have playing like that had I gotten that.
Q. Have you ever eaten the Tomahawk?
JON RAHM: Not that size.
