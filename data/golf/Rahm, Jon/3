  Q. Just assess the match if you could.
 JON RAHM:   Good day.  I just wish I got a little bit of a better start today as well as yesterday, making bogeys.  Playing good golf, just not really quite getting a handle on the wind on those second shots on 2 and 3.  But I stayed patient.  It wasn't easy.  Between the houses and trees, the gusts are hard to predict, and I kind of just was waiting for a couple mistakes from Shane and they happened on 5 and 7 and took advantage of my game after that.  Played really good golf.  I just wish I could have played 16 a little bit better, maybe put more pressure on him, but hey, he made a heck of a run at the end, man.  I hit the shots I needed, just was maybe a little bit too passive on 16 and 17.  But luckily I had a bit of a cushion.
 Q. Tomorrow winner take all between you and Ryan.  You guys are good friends.  What does he bring as a match play opponent for you?
 JON RAHM:   Well, not going to expect many mistakes from him.  He's an absolute ball striker, and he's a Texas man, which means in the wind and gusts and this kind of golf course, he's comfortable.  It's going to take everything I've got.
 How I've been playing has been good enough.  Hopefully, again, I can just maybe start a little bit better on the front nine and made a few birdies early and put the pressure on and just hit the pedal as far down as possible.
