Q. How would you describe the day, Jon? 
JON RAHM: Seriously? How would I describe? Pretty awful. I mean, playing good golf, got a great mud ball on 8, a great mud ball on 18, and I didn't make a single putt. No way I can be happy about it. The golf course was there for scoring, I was playing good, and couldn't take advantage of anything. 
That's all I can say. Fought my ass off at the end to try to salvage an under par round, and I couldn't. Hit some decent drives down the stretch andââ besides 17ââ and couldn't really get it done. Simple as that. Really far back to start tomorrow, that's all I can say. I've got to hope to shoot a miracle score to have a chance.
