 Q.  Jon, good round today.  6-under after ten holes.  Thought on how you played.  
JON RAHM: Man, probably the best ten holes I've played so far this year.  It was an amazing performance.   
Front nine I felt like I didn't miss a shot, and when I got out of position I was able to fix it and sometimes make the putts.   
Too bad on that second shot on 11.  You know, it's just a tough hole.  It's a tough second shot try to hit the green.  I didn't want to bail out left; I wanted to be aggressive.  I made the only poor swing of the day, to be honest.   
After that I kept hitting good shots.  Once the wind picks up a little the back nine gets a little tense, but overall it's an amazing score.  Hopefully the leaders don't make too many birdies today and I have a chance tomorrow.   
 Q.  At 12 and 13 I thought you had two birdie putts there, one I think lipped out, and the one at 13 had a lot of speed on it, the par-3, and that almost went in.  
JON RAHM: Yeah, 12 I thought I made it, to be honest many.  One of the best putts I hit today.  Just stopped breaking and it just grazed the edge.   
Then the on 13, it did have a little bit of speed but it was pretty close to the center.  At the end it just turned left and got the hard lip out.   
It is what it is.  I think the only complaints I could have today was the second shot on 14.  It's a pretty easy wedge shot.  I don't know what happened where I didn't foresee the wind or the lie or something, and ended up going 15 yards wrong on a 90-yard wedge shot.   
I mean, only poor shot on 11.  These things happen.  Sometimes you miss a 3-wood.  Any time you go around this place with one poor shot the whole day, I think it's a pretty, pretty success day.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on tomorrow.  You're at 8-under right now.  Don't know where Justin is going to be.  He's lighting it up early.  What do you have to do tomorrow?  
JON RAHM: He started with two birdies I know; I don't know what he made on 3.   
 Q.  Birdie.  
JON RAHM: He birdied 3?  Yeah, it's not over.  There are a lot of holes to be played.  Hopefully in my case I hope it happens like yesterday and the wind picks up a little bit in the afternoon.   
It's not like it's the easiest pins out there.  1, 2, and 3 are pretty gettable; starting on 4 it's not the easiest.  I mean, 5 is tucked in; 6 is tucked in; 7 is tucked in; 8 is tucked in; 9 is tucked in.  I mean, those pins are not easy.   
I was able to make some putts, so hopefully Justin stops making putts, stops making birdies, and gives the rest of us a chance tomorrow.
