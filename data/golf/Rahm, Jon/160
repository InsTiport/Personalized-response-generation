Q. Good start to the tournament, 67, as good as you could have done?
JON RAHM: A really good finish to the day.  To be honest, it's one of those rounds, I haven't said this in a while, where I've shot the lowest score I could possibly shoot today with the way I was hitting it.
That front nine, I think it was very visible; I wasn't very comfortable.  Some things were going my way but I told my caddie, I was extremely lucky to go 1-under par on the front nine the way things were going.  It got complicated, 10 through 13.
But 14, one good drive, one good swing got me in the rhythm.  And ended up the way it did.
Q. What is the goal this week?
JON RAHM: What is the goal?
Q. Yeah.
JON RAHM: To win.
Q. FedEx or just this tournament?
JON RAHM: Well, I can't win -- I can't the FedExCup here yet.  So step by step would be to win the tournament.
Q. How did you play the 12th?  What did you think of the hole?
JON RAHM: Well, I didn't play it correctly; let's say it that way.
I thought the wind was hurting more than it did.  I hit driver, and even if I missed, I ended up in those bunkers in the middle of the fairway and no shot having to lay up.  Luckily I ended up making par.
Q. From those bunkers?
JON RAHM: Yeah, I laid up and had about 60, 70 yards and hit it to ten feet and made it.  It's a tough hole.  I didn't know the hole before, but they certainly made it really tough.  It's a really narrow fairway on the left side.
Even on the left side of the fairway, you might have the trees in the way and you have a long iron into a brand new green which is pretty firm.  It truly is a test.  You need to hit two really good shots to keep it on the green.
Q. Would you have done anything differently today if you could?  Were you okay with driver off the tee, was it the right --
JON RAHM: No, it was definitely not.  Even if I hit it good, it's almost gone through.  It's definitely at most a 3-wood, which I've been hitting it pretty good.  It would have been going just as far.  Even my caddie, Adam, told me it was a 3-wood.  I thought a driver, hitting it high, the wind was going to stop it enough.  It was definitely a 3-wood.
Q. In your first full year on the U.S. tour, have you found courses or holes that you really don't like, and did you say anything publically about how much you dislike it?
JON RAHM: The thing is, there's always holes that catch your eye more than others.  But if you start getting in the game of saying:  I don't like this hole, this is bad, this is bad, this is this, you're never going to play that hole properly.  You're going to have a very bad attitude going there.
So I always try to -- whenever I don't see a hole that goes through my eyes properly, I always say, "I love this hole."  I try to just do the complete opposite.
Last week was an example.  You know, No. 18 at Glen Oaks.  I ended up loving it.  That birdie on the last day did help a lot.  But you know, it wasn't the greatest because you hit a good driver and you have a downhill lie to a green raised 30, 40 feet that was rock-solid and the green being downhill on that final pin.
It definitely is not like, I would say, the greatest hole or my least favorite, but it's an example of one of those holes where I thought, I love it, I love it.  It's a great golf hole.  Thanks to that I made birdie the last day.
Q. Do you like the whole Playoff idea?  It's not anything that you would have seen before.
JON RAHM: I do like it, because towards the end of the season, you know, it doesn't happen where, like Bernhard Langer on the Champions Tour, he doesn't even have to show up to the last event to win it.
It gives that excitement and the fans, and even the people who are not into golf, the excitement of seeing one guy win it all and like the last few years has gone down at East Lake, right; the way Rory won last year, all the excitement that goes on.  I think it's a great idea.  I'm all for making it more exciting, and hopefully being in the position to be able to win it.
Q. How much do you know about the Senior Tour?  Do you watch it?
JON RAHM: Well, I'm never home so I don't watch much anymore.  I love watching golf.  I'll watch anything.  I know some but I feel like any time I was watching, you have Bernhard Langer on top, Fred Couples, Colin up there, and Tom Lehman messing around.  And then Miguel Ãngel JimÃ©nez, whenever he went out there, it started going up to him; I felt like the top 5 was always the same.
