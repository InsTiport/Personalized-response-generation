Q. Just one of those days, but still only four back.  Small consolation --
JON RAHM:   You know, I think it's one of those days I can't escape here.  That's been my downfall pretty much every time I come.  I can't escape the one day where just nothing goes right, and I can't really post a score.
Unlike yesterday I hit it really good off the tee, and a few that I missed really penalized me.  Yesterday was the opposite.  The few that I hit in the fairway I capitalized.  Today I couldn't get the ball close enough or make any putts at all.
The closest I came from the 5th hole on to make a birdie was that bunker shot on 18.  That's the best look I had all day.  It's just one of those days.
But like you said, the mentality is right now we've played two days of the tournament; I'm four back going into the weekend.  Anything can happen.  I've made up larger distances, and certainly not going to give up on this one.
So hopefully I can play solid golf from now on.
