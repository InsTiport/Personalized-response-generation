Q. You're in a position to win here in Dubai.  How would you describe your round today?
JON RAHM: Man, what words, I mean, I'm kind of a perfectionist.  I always find flaws.  But to be honest, it was as close to a flawless round I'm going to play.  You know, you're always going to miss shots, so we take that into account.  I played really, really solid golf today.
Besides -- well, I mean, I can't say.  No. 1, I had it a perfect driver; it just went in the bunker.  Went a little too far.  But besides that, my lag putting wasn't there but the rest was absolutely flawless.  My iron shots were great.  I was precise.  Short game was good.  Overall, you know, really, really solid round.
Q. Is this the kind of day that you feel like you can build momentum to carry into the final round?
JON RAHM: If this doesn't build momentum, I don't know what's going to.  My last 27 holes, I'm 13-under par.  Take into account the back nine yesterday and the round today.  I'm feeling good.  The game is feeling good.  Hopefully I can keep doing the same thing tomorrow.
Q. It's a congested leaderboard.  How do you mentally prepare for what could be a flat-out shootout tomorrow?
JON RAHM: You know, I feel like if I was on top, it would be a little harder because you only have one-shot leading and you have a bunch of people behind you.  The first few holes on this course are very scorable.  You can be on the first tee and be behind the leader.
I like being just a little ahead, and just feel like I'm one more, one more than these people who are chasing the leaders.  We know it's going to take a low round.  It's been happening in the morning that someone comes and shoots a 63.  Apparently it's easy to do.  You know, you never know, someone who is 5-, 6-, 7-under, shoots a 63, posts 16-, 17-under and we have to catch that.
Hopefully, again, trying to keep doing what I've done till now.  I'm comfortable with the driver and it all starts there.
Q. Round of 65, what pleased you most about your play today?
JON RAHM: I would say my iron game today.  My mid-iron game was really strong.  All of them were on line.  That's what gave me a lot of birdie opportunities on the par 4s today.
Q. Were you feeding off each other much because it seemed like you were birdieing every hole between the two of you.
JON RAHM: He had a great start birdieing the first hole, the third hole and you obviously feed from that.  It helps.  When you see someone playing good, I feel like that positive energy can translate to you if you want it to.  I kind of let it happen and got on a little bit of a roll myself.  Seemed like we were trading birdies.  It was just back and forth.  It was a really fun round.
Q. First time you saw this golf course earlier in the week, and you said it really suited your game.  Do you feel like there's a really low one out there for you tomorrow, because you'll be in full-bore attack mode, I'm sure.
JON RAHM: There could be.  Today I had about as perfect a day as I could have.  I just didn't take advantage of the par 5s.  I had a 3-putt on 2, didn't get up-and-down on 7; the one bad drive on 14.
You know, if I can keep doing what I've been doing all week, which is hit it really well off the tee, I think the rest will take care of itself.
Q. The week started with you being presented the Rookie of the Year award.  How special would it be to finish winning the DP World Tour Championship?
JON RAHM: For many reasons it would be absolutely amazing just because the fact that being Rookie of the Year, winning twice on The European Tour; once was already a dream but twice I've won and both of them being Rolex Series and one being DP World Tour Championship, it would be something really, really special.  It would be the cherry on top of the icing of a great, great year.
