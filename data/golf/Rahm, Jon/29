  Q. Tell me about the eagle.
 JON RAHM:   We had balls coming into me off the tee, yeah.
 It was good.  Obviously a great way to start the round.  Set a good tone.  Great drive on the fairway.  Thought I missed it right on the bunker but great iron shot to about ten, 12 feet and made the putt.  Just a really solid way to start.  Gave me a lot confidence.  After that I hit a lot of good 6-irons off the fairway, as well.
 Q. What was that about the calls coming in?
 JON RAHM:   It's just a joke.  We were waiting on our second shot because somebody in front of us had a problem.  So we were waiting there, the guys behind us being twosomes were playing fast and they were hitting tee shots right over the bunker, and thank God we heard the tee shot.  We tried to hide and try to stop them.  I was just over the bunker, and you couldn't see me.  It's not like it was their fault.  Even though I'm tall, they couldn't see over the bunker.
 Q. Big picture, Playoffs-wise.  Today you made a decent enough move that you keep yourself in a decent spot.  How do you feel about just sort of making a dent right now?
 JON RAHM:   Still one more day.  Yeah, it's as simple as that.  I always try to improve every day on the golf course, right, and so far I've been playing a little bit better.  Today I couldn't finish it off, but it was a heck of a round I had going on.
 So hopefully tomorrow is just a little bit better day and I can get close to that Top-10, have a good round, and if I don't move up, well, at least, like you said, try to stay where I'm at.  We have one more week to hopefully have a strong performance and be in a good spot going to East Lake.  That's the goal right now, right.  It's as simple as that.  Try to hopefully get into the top five going into that last event.
