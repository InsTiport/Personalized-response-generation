 Q.  Great playing and you just said "great saving."  Is that what it felt like?  
JON RAHM: The first six, seven holes, it was extremely windy.  The storm came by.  Gave us a few chances and couldn't get it done.  I just felt like the last five holes, I made a great save on 15 for bogey, great up-and-down on 16, 17 and 18 to go birdie, par, par.  So I was able to round out the round nicely.  Wasn't my best ball-striking day, but at least I was rolling it good and made a few good putts to save it.   
 Q.  Playing with Webb and DJ, playing phenomenal today.  Does it help when you're playing in a group like that that's also playing well?  
JON RAHM: They are two great guys.  It's just a good atmosphere in the group.  Webb had a little rougher day today with that driver issue, hitting 3-wood, so the golf course ended up a little long.   
Like I said yesterday, we feed off each other.  DJ very rarely ever misses shots, and we are all competitive.  It's such a good atmosphere.  It's fun.  So I do believe it helps, yeah.   
 Q.  Some thoughts on your day?  You're in contention again at THE NORTHERN TRUST?  
JON RAHM: Yeah, saved the round.  Swing did not feel good at all, but somehow I just managed to keep the ball in play.  That's all I can say.  There was a couple moments early on, like the shot on 2 where I thought I missed and ended up ten feet from the hole.  A couple holes out there, I was able to manage it and keep the ball on the correct side of the pin and never really short-side myself.   
Everything would have been in vain if I didn't save the last four holes.  The up-and-down for bogey on 15, and the three up-and-downs after that to finish with birdie, par, par, and stay close to the lead were key.   
Hopefully tomorrow I can keep hitting it okay off the tee and maybe polish my iron game a little bit.  I'm rolling it good and the rest of the game feels good, so hopefully it gets a little better.
