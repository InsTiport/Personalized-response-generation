Q. Give you are your thoughts on the last two days.
JON RAHM: Well, I think I gave my thoughts about yesterday pretty clearly.  Solid round of golf today.
Just a bad shot and didn't happen to get any really good breaks.  I hit it into three bunkers on 6, 8, and 9, and all of them were as bad a lie as they could have been.
I mean, it is what it is.  I tried my hardest into the 18th hole.  At least I can say I made birdie to that pin on the 18 at Carnoustie.  Besides that, things didn't happen.  I can't give an explanation really.  I don't know.
Q. You were going along well after six holes.  Were you happy with the way you were playing?
JON RAHM: Absolutely.  I did miss a couple of short putts, but I played great.  I had 10 feet for birdie on 1.  Less than 10 feet for birdie on 3.  I had a birdie putt on 4 and 5, and on 6 I hit two good shots.  It was just an unfortunate lie.  7, I hadn't miss a driver left all week, and with the wind left to right, I never expect for the ball to go that straight.  Just things that happen.
I wasn't feeling 100 percent confident with my swing starting the week.  I knew I was going to have to kind of fight my way around, but today just whenever I start missing shots to the left is really hard for me to play.
Q. A lot of things have sort of gone right this season, obviously, in Madrid.  How sort of emotional do you feel at letting this championship slip away?
JON RAHM: Slip away.  I don't think I ever had a grasp on it.  It's just sad.  You never know in a major.  Once you make the cut, you can have a good weekend.  You get the right side of the draw, and you're playing some good weather, and you might be able to make some shots back and make it happen.  You never know.
Brooks was able to shoot crazy under par at Shinnecock in the last 3 1/2 rounds or 2 1/2 rounds.  You just never know what can be done.  What stings more is missing the cut the last two majors knowing how good I played at Augusta.
It is what it is.  At the end of the day, it is one more tournament.  So I'm still pretty young.  Hopefully, I'm going to be playing this for a long time, and I'm going to play a lot of major championships.
Right now we have a wonderful part of the schedule coming up, a lot of good events, and hopefully I can finish strong.
Q. (Inaudible).
JON RAHM: Yeah, just reflect on what happened.  Right now I'm not in any mental state to think about what happens, to be honest.  But honestly, I mean, at least I have a couple more days to rest before Akron.  Again, we have six really important events coming up.  Hopefully, I can get my game straight again.  It's not really far off.  And hopefully, you know, get myself in contention again soon enough.
Q. Any regrets about going with driver both days?
JON RAHM: No.  Just bad swings, bad irons.  I was going to make bad swings whether I had an iron or I had a driver in my hands.  It's just -- it is what it is.  It happen.  I have no regrets on the strategy.  I don't think it was any strategic problem, say it like that.
