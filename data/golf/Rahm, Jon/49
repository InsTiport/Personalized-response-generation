Q. Here with Jon Rahm. How would you assess your play today?
JON RAHM: It's tough to do right now because thinking about it just missing the last three putts on the last few holes, I played really good other than that. But besides that, played good. The same thing keeps happening with me and this golf course. I can't figure out how to play the first six, seven, eight holes under par. Besides that, it's been good golf. It's windy early on. It's hard to hit it close, and it's hard to be aggressive when there's 20, 30 miles an hour of wind. So I feel like maybe tomorrow, just come out with maybe a little bit more intent or a little bit more aggressive, a little bit more confident shots, hope I can hit a couple close and maybe go to the ninth tee under par.
Q. Is your game where you think it should be right now? If not, how close?
JON RAHM: I mean, it's hard to tell what it should be right now just because I haven't really played that much besides the Bahamas, but even before. Then taking time off, thinking about the wedding and things like that, so I really haven't done much. But I'm playing good. There's a difference between hitting the ball and competing and actually scoring.
