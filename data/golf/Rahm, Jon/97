Q. 4-under 68.  How would you grade your third round on the Stadium Course?
JON RAHM: It was good.  I would say it was a B, B plus.  If I had to grade it that way.  I played solid, I think the one thing missing today was the driver, it was a little couple misses off the tee and then I think it went good towards the end.  But it was more 1 through 5, honestly.  The first five holes is what cost me, going 1-over par on those holes, hitting it pretty good.  So after that I got six birdies.  It was the one part of the course that if I had shot 1- or 2-under like you can, it would have been a great round.
Q. They say B's get degrees but right now it doesn't have you in the top 3.  Are you kind of surprised that at 16-under par, that you're five back of Phil and four back of Adam Hadwin?
JON RAHM: Not surprised, it just makes me remember a couple of the shots I missed today and what I could have done better.  But conditions are perfect, the courses are perfect, the greens are perfect, there's no wind whatsoever, and the courses are soft because of the rain early in the week.  So there's really scorable conditions and you got to take advantage of it.  I've definitely missed a few putts every single day that I can remember and close ones to the hole that you can't miss on a week like this because you have to go low.
Q. It's a tough golf course, 4-under par 68, I consider that a good round, were you happy with it?  I know there was some putts that I thought you had made that didn't go in.
JON RAHM: Yeah, there was a couple, but definitely it's a good round, especially from 6 on, the last 13 holes, to get, I got a good six birdies in there and unfortunately a bogey that I thought was a good shot on 15.  But, yeah, 1 through 5 is where I think I missed the mark.  Those are holes that, with where I hit the tee shot on 5, I hit it in the fairway, you can go under par, 1- or 2-under par and that would have been the difference between an amazing round and a good round.  But still I'm four or five shots back so far, I hope Phil doesn't get too hot towards the end, but if you hit good shots you can.  But it's going to take a low one tomorrow.
Q. I know the bogey at the par-5 5th early in the day was a disappointment, but I was so impressed that you would bounce back with a 2 on one of harder par-3s out there and then use putter from the edge of the green to put back-to-back birdies up at 6 and 7.
JON RAHM: Yeah, I wasn't too happy to go 1-over on the par-5s on the front nine.  Especially on 5, I hit a great driver and the second shot was completely flushed, it's just it went about 10 feet right of where I wanted to go and ended up in the water.  The air's a little heavy in the morning, the ball doesn't go far.  But, yeah, the 5-iron on 6 was pretty good and the putt on 7, getting 2-under par so quickly after making that bogey it definitely got my confidence up and I started playing a lot better after that.
Q. I imagine your goal when you teed off on Thursday was to have a chance on Sunday.  You're going to have that opportunity.  You're going to have to play well, but you're going to have the opportunity.
JON RAHM: I'm going to need to play really well and I'm going to need the leaders to have a slow start, but anything can happen.
