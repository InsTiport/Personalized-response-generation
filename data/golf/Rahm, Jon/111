 Q.  Birdied 18 every day.  How good did it nearly look for eagle there?  
JON RAHM: The only thing I could tell, it was based on the reaction of the crowd.  From my point of view it was about a foot left of the pin.  I don't know if it spun to the right and got close, but it was definitely close when I got there.  Making it is always a bonus.  I would have taken a birdie any day, so I'm very happy finishing in style.   
 Q.  Defence has gone very well to this point.  Thoughts now looking at the leaderboard, your position, scoring conditions as we look ahead to the final day?  
JON RAHM: Well, today was definitely as tough a is the up, the toughest day based on wind and the toughest day for me because it was my worst ball-striking day.  I saved a couple extremely good pars out there on the front nine.   
It's just too bad I couldn't make the birdie putts.  I gave myself plenty of options.  I just couldn't make them to post a really good round but I'll take a 69 and I'll take the spot I'm in.  Hopefully tomorrow I have a good ball-striking day and make a few putts early on, and give the guys on top a little bit of a scare.
