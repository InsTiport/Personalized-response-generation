 Q.  Obviously a really tough finish today.  Disappointed?  
JON RAHM: Yes, very.  I played great tee to green, made two putts all day.  I know it was a good round, I had it going.  It's just the finish.  More than missing the putt, it was a bad lack of commitment on the tee shot on 18.  Trying to do too much of the shot instead of just trying to hit it in the fairway, that's it.   
I knew 8 could hold, birdie would put me in a great position, with 7 and 5 back right now, I need a lot of people to fail to have not too much to make up tomorrow.   
It's just a little disappointing, that's it.   
 Q.  You said the rest of your round was great.  There are a lot of positives to take into tomorrow.  
JON RAHM: Yeah.  Again, up until 14, I played good, I just couldn't make a single putt, it was as simple as that.  There was a lot of them that were close, they just were not going in.  I made a few on 14, 16, and 17, which got me to 4-under.  But besides that, it just really -- I haven't been able to make them all week.   
That's the difference between the guys who are at 12-under right now and me being at 7.  I hardly doubt they're playing much better than me tee to green.  It's just they're making more putts than I am.   
 Q.  Is it pace?  
JON RAHM: No, no.  I think yesterday was more lack of commitment on my part, and not great strokes today.  A couple of them were misreads.  There were a lot of them that were really good, really close starting from the start.  The one on 1 was dead center.  3 was burning the edge.  5 was close.  7 was close.  9 I made par.  10 was very close.  11 was on line.   
There were good putts today.  I can't complain about anything else.  It was just if they go in early on you get that confidence and maybe finish the round a little better.   
But still, even though it was a good round, it's just the finish.  Again, more than the putt or the other shots, it was the tee shot that I'm just a little disappointed at myself.   
 Q.  What do you feel like you need to do tomorrow?  
JON RAHM: Same thing.  Luckily tomorrow I'm going to be 4, 5, 6 shots behind, and I'm going to have to be aggressive.  It all depends on the weather, who knows.  It looks like it's going to be pretty bad.   
It's lack of playing good, and hoping the leaders don't play good, right?  But still, I'm going to have to be pretty aggressive to make up a lot of shots.
