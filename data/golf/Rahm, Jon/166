Q. Just a couple of comments about your round today?
JON RAHM: Well, to be honest, really pleased with the score.  You know, driving was good today I would say.  I did take last week off, so a little bit of rustiness.  It wasn't my best ball-striking day when it comes to the irons.
I didn't hit my best quality shot with the irons.  I felt like I didn't really take advantage of all the opportunities I had over there but a couple of good breaks, a couple of bad ones like always.  Overall I'm really pleased with a 2-under par round given how I hit the irons today.
Q. A lot of guys have been saying there's quite a difference in scoring on front and back nine.
JON RAHM: Well, I shot the same score on both nines.  You know, you can tell just because 1, 2, 3 and 4 is an extremely hard start.  I had 6-iron into the first hole, a 6-iron on the second, hard reachable par 5 and then another 6-iron into the fourth -- and that's me.  Dustin had 6-, 7-irons, as well.
So when you have the longest hitters in the world hitting those kind of shots, the rest of the field are going to be hitting something longer; it just makes it tough.  It's not the easiest start.
Once you get to No. 8, is when it gets a little bit easier.  It gets a little shorter and that's where you can be more aggressive.  I think that's where the difference is.  You can have a really hard start on those holes.
