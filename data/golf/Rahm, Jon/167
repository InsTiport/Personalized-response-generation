 Q.  I was impressed how you kept it together in a round which was pretty frustrating because you hit the ball great.  Just things weren't going your way.  
JON RAHM: I don't know, the back nine, certainly I ended up putting it all back together.  All those par putts on 11, 12, 13, certainly kept me going.  You know, that bonus on 14 actually got things going to finish the way it did.   
I don't know, that front nine was a little bit strange.  I did hit a lot of good shots and then there was a lot of bad ones.  I felt like being 1-under par through nine was actually a really good score.  And then the finish, I would have taken anything under par.   
 Q.  Talk about 12 and 13.  12 is just a tough break.  Tee shot looked pretty good.  You end up in the bunker and hit a nice wedge shot and made the putt.  
JON RAHM: I thought the wind was gusting hard enough so it wouldn't get there.  I actually missed it and got there, so that was the wrong club.  Adam did tell me it was a 3-wood.  I didn't listen.  I should from now on.   
But yeah, I mean, once that happened, you're in kind of safe mode.  So laid up with pitching wedge and ended up with a pretty good yardage, 70 yards, and I made the 10-footer.   
Then 13, 13 was just a good tee shot.  Barely missed the fairway, got a flyer out of there and went long.  Horrible chip.  There's no other way to describe that one.  Terrible chip, and got lucky with a 15-footer.   
Those 3-putts, and 11, as well.  Making those three pars was a huge difference today.
