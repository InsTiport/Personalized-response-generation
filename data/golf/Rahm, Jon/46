Q. I know you're frustrated by the bogey on 18. You only had one par on the back nine. How would you describe that roller coaster of a final nine holes?
JON RAHM: Frustrated is a very light way of putting it right now. I don't know. I mean, front nine, things weren't going. Finished with a good birdie. I hit an okay driver on 10, and then I was absolutely dead from there. I put a great swing on five birdies, playing great golf, and then just an absolutely terrible finish on the second nine. Could have easily taken two shots out of those three at the end. Obviously, it was just a horrible finish. I don't know what to say. It's just a bad way to finish. If I finish with three birdies after making that whole mistake on the back nine, you end up with a different outlook, kind of like how Justin finished. It's just rough. It's an easy shot on 16, I mean, how short it's playing, 3-wood to the front edge of the green on 17, and just driver, wedge on 18. So could not be an easier finish, but to finish 2-over par on those three holes, yeah, that pisses me off.
Q. Big picture, you're just outside the top-10, you've never finished outside the top-16 in this event. As a former Arizona State standout, what's the support been like this week with everything at stake?
JON RAHM: Honestly, finishing 16th or 34th makes no difference to me. We are here to win and as I see it right now, I'm seven shots behind, that's a lot to make up. It's great to have the fan support. There's a lot of people out here. They're out here to watch golf. And it's fun, honestly, it's a lot of fun to play out there. But at the same time it's frustrating when you can't get things going. Like I said, finishing 16th, 17th, 34th or 90th, I don't know about that. I want to play my best and try to win. And what I have in mind is if J.B. doesn't make any more birdies, there's a lot of room to make it up.
Q. (No Microphone.)
JON RAHM: I'm very frustrated right now. I'm not going to lie. Those last three holes were playing extremely easy. 16 was playing really short straight down wind.
17 I hit an okay 3-wood to the front of the green.
18 is a driver/wedge.
Couldn't picture a much easier finish than that. So to drop two on those last three holes, yeah, it's rather disappointing, but there's a lot of great things to look at out there, the five straight birdies was unbelievable, making really good putts, but I got to tidy up the game. There was a lot of those birdies that I could have made it a little bit easier on myself, I got lucky to make the putts, like the one on 15 and 13, right. So, hopefully, I can just get a little bit more precise the next few days and I need to, to make up the difference.
