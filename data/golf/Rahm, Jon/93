  JON RAHM: It wasn't great. I got off to a pretty good start on the first four holes. And then kind of slowed down a little bit. But it took a very long time to make a birdie until the eagle on 13, which was great. But a big GAP in between.   
   
 Q. Do you feel like the eagle on 13 and the birdie on 15 gave you momentum going into tomorrow?  
JON RAHM: No. Tomorrow is a whole new day. The first two holes turned me around and gave me a remote chance, depending on how everyone finishes. The other thing, the momentum, I hit a lot more solid coming in, starting on 8. Actually starting on 7. Besides the second shot, all the tee shots were good, and the iron shots were solid. And it was a little better than the last few days. It was hard.  
   
 Q. What are your thoughts on the group pairings for tomorrow?  
JON RAHM: Well, whatever they need to do to get it done tomorrow. It's unusual to see a Masters do that, especially split tees. I can't remember the last time it was split tees. But it is what it is. It's a thunderstorm, it's heavy, and if it's potentially not being able to finish until Monday I think it's worth it. Hopefully having everybody tee off at the same time can maybe give us an advantage for some of us.
