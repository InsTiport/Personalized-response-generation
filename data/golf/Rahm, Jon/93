Q. Very adventurous outward nine for you today and then you settled down there on the front and made some birdies.
JON RAHM: To say the least.  A lot going on, definitely.  I made some bogeys -- I wasn't really making that bad of swings, but it still kept being adventurous on 1 and 2 and then everything seemed to settle down a little bit.  Rocky start, rocky through, and I was just really glad I pulled it through after No. 2, I had two great pars on 1 and 2, and I thought that would start something and definitely I had a pretty good round.
Q. Tough lie there in the bunker for your third at 6, but you recovered from that bogey.  Talk about how important it is to birdie 8 and 9 coming in for the weekend?
JON RAHM: We didn't get the best lie in the fairway, to that pin I was dead.  I was trying to get it to the up slope of the bunker and get it up-and-down.  And I hit a really bad 8-iron and 7 got a 2-putt.  And to bounce back making birdie on 8 and 9, 8 is not an easy hole.  Having three feet straight down the hill couldn't be any happier.  That driver on 9 set it all up.  I had 130 yards left, a little right to the wind, it was just an easy wedge to that pin.  Definitely a lot of good things to take from the last few holes.  Hopefully I can figure it out from the beginning tomorrow starting there.
