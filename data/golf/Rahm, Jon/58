 Q.  That was a very solid opening round for you, five birdies, just a single bogey. How did you see the day?  
JON RAHM: Yeah, it was very solid. I played really good golf. There was a little bit of a stumble, obviously, at 11 and 12. Those two holes, I probably had one of the worst professional shots I've hit in my life on 11, followed by a pretty bad drive on 12, but luckily that fairway is pretty wide. It was just a couple of bad -- couple of shots. It's pure rust, a couple of those were. The mind wasn't in the right place; I didn't really just focus on one shot.   
Besides that, it was a great day. I played really solid all throughout. It's great to be back here in Maui and to see the greens being as good as they are. I feel like this place has been good to me in the past, and right now the greens are firming up beautifully, so it's a lot of fun.   
 Q.  I thought we had some cross-wind out here today. Usually it's either straight into us or straight down.  
JON RAHM: Yeah, so it was a little bit more -- you play a lot of cross-wind, but 18 usually plays down, and today it was into off the right. And it's been kind of moving a little bit. It made some of the holes on the back nine play a little bit shorter. 13 and 14 played significantly shorter than they do usually, same with 15. But again, I think more than the direction, it's just it didn't blow as hard as it usually blows. We're used to 20-mile-an-hour winds out here, and we hardly had anything. It was a delight. It was one of the most enjoyable walks we're going to have this year.   
 Q.  I think you're in for the good stuff tomorrow, maybe 35-mile-per-hour winds, 40 percent chance of rain. Get some rest. You may need it. You're on your way.  
JON RAHM: I'm going to maybe have nightmares. Thank you.
