Q. If we could just get you to assess the week.
JON RAHM: I'm going to say the same thing I've said until now: Great, tee to green. Can't make a putt to save my life. Simple as that, honestly. It's just hard to see. I don't know if it was misreads or mishits with the putter, but the frustrations kind of ended up feeding into the rest of the game and not allowing me to maybe hit the ball as good as I could have the last few days. But still was able to reel it back today on the back nine, gave myself chances. But it's just sad, well not sad, it's just, not it hurts, it's just frustrating when you see a lot of them that you think might go in, they don't go in and that's golf, it is what it is. Hopefully, I might sneak in another top-10, which is obviously not my priority, but it's nice to keep the streak going.
Q. What can you tell me about the crowds this week, not just on 16 but throughout the tournament?
JON RAHM: Well they're quiet today. They're either hung over or pre-partying for the Super Bowl. So it's always great. Besides, as always, you have a lot of people here, there's a small percentage of people that may have some extra drinks and may try to have fun the wrong way and maybe those people aren't golf fans, they really don't know how to behave or what you need to do at a golf tournament. But besides the few, the small percentage, the everybody else is great. The atmosphere overall is so good, it's so much fun and it's really rewarding to hit good shots or make birdie putts or even just making putts, whatever it is, they're so energetic and so nice and it just makes you want to do it just because of how much fun it is to get cheered every time you hit a good shot or make a good putt or a birdie. So it kind of feeds into it, that's why when I got on a streak of five birdies in a row I just kept, I wanted to keep hearing those cheers. And you can feed off of that, I did it on the back nine after going really bad on the front nine, fed off the crowd a little bit and that got me going. So you can use it for your advantage.
