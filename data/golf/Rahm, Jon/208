Q. 4-under today, and that's going to give you another Top-5 finish.  Just tell me how you felt about the round today.
JON RAHM: I felt overall very good.  I feel like I played very, very well.  Just a few mistakes.  I 3-putted two of the par-5s when I was on the green.  And skulled it from 80 yards out of bounds which I was not expecting.  So that was costly.  But still I'm proud of myself.  After that double early on, feeling good, that 3-putt double stretch was not good enough.  So I was able to pull myself up, I hit really good shots into the green on 4 and 5 and 6.  And I was not able to make birdies and I just kept going and made a good putt on 7 and that's what got the round going again.
Q. It's a unique event on the PGA TOUR.  What did you think of it?
JON RAHM: It's amazing.  Until about two weeks ago I had another course in my mind which was the most beautiful.  Then I got to Torrey Pines and I said it can't get much better than that.  Then I showed up here to the 4 tee box, even 3, but just on the 4 tee box, that stretch of holes, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.  And you say Pebble, Monterey is up there, too.  It's a beautiful setting and so is Spyglass.  So it's really unique.
Q. Your mindset changed going into tournaments now being a winner on TOUR even going to the final round where you're trying to chase somebody down, has your mindset changed and the confidence that you're able to do it?
JON RAHM: It hasn't changed.  I've always had that confidence in myself.  The only difference is that I just I think I proved to other people that I could do it.  I always had that confidence in myself, that's why I did it.  I was able to do it at Torrey and I'll always carry that into the last few rounds.  That's what I had today.  That's what kept me going after that double bogey.  I knew they were far, but if you don't compete to win you feel, at least I feel like I'm not going to change my best.
