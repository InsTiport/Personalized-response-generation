 Q.  Nice round today, 5-under.  Just give us some thoughts on the day today?  
JON RAHM: Well, a long day.  Obviously when we started, it got really windy, so I knew the front nine was going to be hard.  Luckily for me, I started with three straight birdies and that gave me a lot of confidence, a little cushion.  I knew there were going to be a couple bogeys coming up because the putts are hard.  I just stayed patient and I got lucky and I made the birdie on 8.   
On the back nine, I just played really good golf.  I did have some misunderstandings with the wind where we didn't judge it properly.  Hit good shots that didn't end up the way we thought they were going to be.   
But overall, I got lucky in other places.  I played a great round.  Putting felt great.  And I've got to say, I had a couple of really good up-and-downs over there.  My wedge game, for sure, saved me a little bit.   
 Q.  From your perspective on this golf course, what is the key to scoring well?  Is it driving from the tee or around the greens, what's more important?  
JON RAHM: Well, certainly you need both.  For how firm the greens are, you need to be in the fairway.  You need to see the pin sheet obviously before you tee off to know what side of the fairway -- if you miss fairway, what side of the rough you want to be on to at least have a chance.   
But being able to hit the fairway is really important.  If you can hit it long and have shorter irons in, you can spin it more, it's a huge advantage.   
 Q.  This is your fourth tournament as a professional.  You've been in different countries already.  How has the adjustment been and what's the biggest difference for you?  
JON RAHM: The adjustment, I'm getting there.  Obviously I had a great first week, kind of seemed like a dream, and then reality hit.  I'm not used to playing so much golf in a row, three straight weeks.  I'm used to playing tournaments in a row but college is three days, not six days, the entire week playing golf.   
So I kind of got tired and I learned that I need to pace myself even more.  Maybe less practice rounds.  Practice a little bit less after.  Be able to rest as much as I can, and in my case, being more consistent with the diet, that's probably the key for myself.   
 Q.  And just finally, having talked about that adjustment, playing late and then having to come back early and play again, is there anything different that you do compared to playing early and then late and having a short turnaround?  
JON RAHM: Well, if I play early and then late in the afternoon, then maybe I just practice a little bit and try to get my mind off golf.  Watch a movie, do whatever, you have time for a long dinner.  Today I might go back and just do room service and go to sleep.  If I can keep the feeling that I have right now and the momentum going until tomorrow morning, it will be great.
