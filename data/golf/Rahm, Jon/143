 Q.  Your overall reaction to what seemed like a frustrating day out there for you?  
JON RAHM: Seemed like it?  It was very frustrating.  I think it's just overall feeling of the week.  It's just I've been feeling good, hitting good shots.  I just wouldn't say it was my most fortunate week and we all know you need some fortune to win a tournament.  It all started on No. 2 where I hit it, I mean, arguably the narrowest fairway to hit.  I hit it dead center, flat lie, in a divot.  That's just a sign that things are not going to go good.  And even though I turned it around and I hit a good shot, once I made the second par putt on 11, another 20-footer in a row for par, I thought things, I was putting good, I was feeling good, I was just waiting for that moment and it just never happened.  Once I had that shot on 15 go in the water I just thought that unless I finished hole-in-one, eagle, birdie or something like that, there was no chance.  So I fought to the end, tried to make a birdie on 18, tried to get into the top-10.  It's just things that happen, it's golf, it just happens.   
 Q.  Is it still comforting that even with some bad shots down the stretch you were still able to finish top-10, Top-5 every week?  
JON RAHM: That's exactly what I was telling Adam.  It's not my best week.  I've done a lot of things good, but definitely not my A game.  A couple of bad bounces here and there.  We still had a chance to compete for the win on the back nine.  It's something to look at the positives when my worst is still that good.  It wasn't my worst round, I played good.  It's just, it would be a lot harder to just to fight to make cuts or just not to make cuts, and try to fight for 30th place.  I should be happy and humble, but fact that my bad days I'm still competing to be top-10, if not win.  But at some point it's going to happen and hopefully I will win again.
