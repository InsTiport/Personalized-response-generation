 Q.  You said after yesterday's round that you would have to have a great round in order to win.  I thought you did have a great round, those guys in front of you played really well too.  
JON RAHM: Yeah, definitely.  I started thinking about it last night, I thought I was going to need somewhere around 8-, 9-, 10-under.  I definitely played really good tee to green to make a lot of birdies, but it's just I didn't make a few of the short ones and I didn't get the run that I needed.  Still a great heck of a round, final round under par, 21-under total, I mean 41-under in two years here, so I'll definitely take it -- actually, no, 42.   
 Q.  And I thought you putted well.  I thought that a twist of the ball here or there on and those putts drop.  
JON RAHM: Oh, yeah, there was a lot of them close, it wasn't like it was bad putts, it was just a couple of them that -- I missed a lip out on 11, just short putts you don't want to see missed, but still that's how good I hit it tee to green, right?  When you got a lot of looks and you start missing sometimes it's easy to get a little bit anxious but still I wouldn't say my putting was bad.   
 Q.  And now you get to go to Torrey Pines and carry a lot of momentum down there.  Maybe another win there.  
JON RAHM: Hopefully.  What's working is tee to green which is something that you really need at Torrey Pines, so hopefully I got another good week coming up.
