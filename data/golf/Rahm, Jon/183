Q. Jon, could you just talk a little bit about your third round here.
JON RAHM: Well, you know, I would say a lot of up and downs.  I wasn't really accurate with the driver on the front nine.  The only fairway I hit was No. 9.  That didn't help.
I ended up making an amazing birdie on 1, very unexpected.  Obviously, you know, Colonial is going to get you if you don't put it in position.
I struggled up until 9.  After that I hit a lot of fairways.  I think the next one I missed was 14.  From then on, I just put myself in position, hit some greens, and actually made some putts.
But still, you know, I keep going back to 17 tee shot.  I absolutely stroked it beautifully.  I thought 100% the ball would be in the fairway.  It just kept turning left and catching the wind, and then from the bunker it's a tough lie.
But like I been saying, if on 18 someone told me I was going to finish even par I would be really happy with it.  Great round.  Still in position.  Just positive thoughts for tomorrow.
Q. (Regarding the heat and the wind.)
JON RAHM: Well, the wind actually helps because it cools you down.  The heat, couple courses -- couple spots on the course makes it tough.  Especially me.  I'm a person that's warm and usually hot.  A place like this -- look at all of you right in the shade right now.  Nobody is in the sun.
It really is tough.  There's been some putts where you're like standing on it and couple sweat drops came down.  I'm like, Oh, boy.  That's why I had to move back.
Your hands get sweaty.  Just be patient and take a couple extra seconds to hit the ball and make sure you stay hydrated.
