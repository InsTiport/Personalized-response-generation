Q. Strong finish.  Obviously birdie at the last, that helps a tie for third.  How did you find it?
JON RAHM: Well, you guys keep saying it's the FedExCup Playoff event, but I don't think of it this way.  It's been quite a long time since I had such a good tournament on the PGA TOUR and it's good to be back on track.
Q. You had a run going and got it to one shot back after the par 5 13th.  Take us through the finish.  Was it just trying to press, trying to get the win?
JHONATTAN VEGAS: No, I mean, what would happen, happened.  I missed both par 3s in a spot where you can't miss.  You can go 20 yards left and be okay and have a chance for par, maybe a highly unlikely birdie.  11, 12, 13, all birdie holes, which I proved, so I expected them to at least get to 13-under.  That's where my mind was.  I tried another birdie on 14.  It was a good putt.  It's just a tough pin location.  15, left myself in an impossible spot.
And 17, the bunker shot was about as good as I can do it.  My caddie told me it landed on the edge of the green on the fringe is why it rolled so far.  Ended up, par, par or bogey, birdie is the same finish.  I just wish I would have been able to make more birdies and have a solid finish.  But hopefully we'll save it for East Lake.
