Q. Jon, what is the key to you getting off to this crazy fast start?
JON RAHM: I think the key today was the putting.  Great putts, hit them perfectly.  Those putts saved me a lot.  Those two putts and the par putt I made, a lot of emphasis making that up-and-down because that was key to not miss the shot there, especially mentally after the spot where I was in that bunker.  It just gave me a lot of confidence.  I had good tee shots and I had perfect numbers into the pins and executed the shots the way I did.  I really -- I mean, I really was comfortable on the golf course after hole No. 6.
Q. Feels familiar.  We were here yesterday when you closed out.  This is maybe your lucky spot.
JON RAHM: Maybe.  Who knows?  I feel fortunate to finish both rounds.  I played amazing golf today.  Made some key putts that I needed.  Too bad Charles missed a couple over there.  That's what the difference was, I made the putts and he didn't today.
Q. The hole you lost on 6, I thought it was a tough break.  The stripe of sand around the golf ball affected the shot?
JON RAHM: No, not in the bunker.  I just got it too clean.  I used the 52 degree wedge.  The ball was below my feet.
Hopefully I can keep playing smart.
Q. Do you feel like you are getting better as the week goes by?
JON RAHM: This morning was definitely the best I played as a whole.  The first few days I hit the driver really well the whole round and that's probably why I won.  Today started a little shaky.  I got birdies out of bad drives.  The difference today is that I was making the putts.  I was hitting everything good, not making really big mistakes but I made the putts.  That's what the difference was.
Q. How much match play have you played the last couple of years?
JON RAHM: Since I came to the States to start at Arizona State, actually maybe one tournament a year.  Really back in Europe, I represented Team Spain.  Whenever we played a match in school, when you're one-on-one, it felt like match play.  Even if it was stroke play, it felt like match play.
Q. Phil was taking you on as a partner in the practice rounds.  Has that helped at all?
JON RAHM: We have been both, let's say, competitors and partners.  And he does help.  Because practice rounds sometimes can be long.  You don't want to -- at least in my case I don't want to overthink too much.  A couple of rounds is good enough to see the course.  One of them if you have extra time having a match is good to get mentally ready for what the course is going to be like.
Q. He said he played against you early, but he won't anymore.  He said you'll be his partner.
JON RAHM: We've played four times and he beat me the last time.  So I don't know if it's going to happen or not.  He probably got some confidence out of that one.
