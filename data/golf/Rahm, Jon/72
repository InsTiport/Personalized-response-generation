Q. What does it mean to win your second Irish Open in three years?
JON RAHM: I keep saying, I love is this tournament.  I love this country.  I love the people and feel like I'm at home every time I come.  My game was in great form.  Just didn't show the first two days.  I couldn't hole the putts, and the weekend was the complete opposite.  Putts started rolling in from everywhere.  I felt really confident and I knew I could do something.
I knew I had to do it today to have a chance, and man, I kept looking at the leaderboard and looking up, and after 10, I'm like, okay, let's get a good run and that eagle on 12 just completely got me going.  Even though I had the little mistake on 13, I just knew that my target number was 15-under.  I knew 15-under was going to have a strong chance.
Never thought I was going to shoot 16-under birdieing 18.  Definitely thrilled with the back nine I had.  Me and Adam did a lot of work over the weekend to polish the mistakes over the first few days.  Excited to repeat.  I think Seve was the only Spanish player to win more than one and to join my name to that Cup again, it's special.  It's probably one of my favorite trophies that I have at home, and to have another one, it's definitely special, a special moment.  I don't know how to explain it.
Q. Starting the day five behind, going out in 31, and the eagle at 12 you said was the turning point.  What was through your mind making birdie after birdie in front of that crowd so vocal and supportive of you?
JON RAHM: It feeds into it.  It helps.  I was just with my sight forward.  I always like to feel like I'm one shot back, and when I made that eagle on 12, I was one shot back.  Little different that the leader were making bogeys and maybe I made a small mistake on 13, a little bit too aggressive.
But when I got to 14 green, I was tied for the lead.  I didn't expect that.  And the crowd was just being tremendous, even on the walk from 13 and 14 tee, they were being tremendous.  When I got to the tee, I was right back in it.  That did help a lot, and making that birdie on 14, thanks to staying a little more patient and focused on the shot, and believing that I'm more than one back, right, and I got the little surprise that I was tied for the lead.  I was part of the leaders and I thought, well, let's separate ourselves.
Q. How excited about the possibilities going into Portrush?
JON RAHM: I'm excited because it's going to be Northern Ireland, a lot of Irish crowd out there.  Good memories.  Portstewart wasn't too far away.  I'm going to go to Portrush with a lot of good memories and good vibes.  I'm going to have huge support from the crowd and hopefully I can keep my good golf going into Ireland.  I can't wait to go to Portrush and visit the Harbour Bistro like I did every single night like I was there, I'm sure I'll see a lot of people again and hopefully enjoy the week and play the best Open I've played so far.
