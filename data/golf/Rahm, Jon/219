Q. What was the feeling for you, walking off the course after the week that you had?
JON RAHM: It was a great feeling to just make the cut and top it off with shooing just 2 over for the weekend.  Great feeling on 18, having a chance to make birdie to finish my amateur career.
It's a special moment being where I am and being this course and today the last day of my amateur career.
Q. How did you feel about your last round?
JON RAHM: Felt great.  After six holes, I was really feeling it.  I was hitting the ball great but in Oakmont, you can't get too cocky, because it's going to get you.  I made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch.  I was able to get back the good birdies at 12 and 14, back to 1 under.  Finished even par.  Really happy about it for sure.
Q. What are the expectations with you arriving at the U.S. Open as an amateur?  Are you thinking win?  Are you thinking do well?  Just what's the thought when you get here?
JON RAHM: I really didn't have many expectations until I played the practice rounds.  I had played the course a month before, but I really didn't know what I was going to find this week.
After Monday and Tuesday, I was like, let's go make the cut first because the course is extremely tough.  It's something like I've never played before, not even close.
Then the rain comes so there was a different game plan.  Maybe that's why I had a bad first round.  But my plan was the same.  First, make the cut.  After that, shoot as low as possible during the weekend.
Q. Was there anything about the course that played to your strengths or took away something you're used to doing?
JON RAHM: I would say the length played to my advantage because I was hitting the driver pretty good this week.
Against me, I would just say the amount of rough close to the green.  I'm not used to playing those greens with this speed and this kind of undulation and this high of a rough next to the green.  Most of the amateur events we have are a little down so we play a little faster.
That would be my -- the thing against me on this course.
Q. What lies ahead now that you've completed this?
JON RAHM: I'm turning pro next week, playing the Quicken Loans and Barracuda, Barbasol, and John Deere right now.  I'm feeling positive about two other extensions, but I need to wait until they make it official first.  So far, four events and try to take advantage of those four events.
