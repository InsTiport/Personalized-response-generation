 Q.  I know you got a little frustrated on the greens but you seemed to be doing exactly what you thought you would and playing solidly.  
JON RAHM: Yeah, it's been kind of taking me back to the early days in the year at Torrey Pines where I was striking the ball beautifully and my iron game felt so good.  It's too bad, just like you said, a couple holes -- a lot of putts, a long one on 2.  I can name 5, 7, 8 and 9 that I thought I had made all of them.  All of them touched the holes.   
It's just one of those days.  It could have been a really, really, really good round.  Luckily I put myself in position.  But those putts I missed -- paid off with those two up-and-downs on 17 and 18.  It could have been a really bad ending for the round, so overall, pretty happy.   
 Q.  Given what Jordan's done today and that DJ is in front of you, does it just change the way you go about tomorrow?  Do you have to go lights-out to get things done?  
JON RAHM: You know none of those two guys is going to give it to you.  Last time we all thought Jordan was going to give it to someone and ended up with a stellar finish for the ages.  We know worst case, he's going to shoot a couple under par and we're going to have to have a very low round, so hopefully we get it done.   
 Q.  And this occasion, this is your first FedExCup Playoffs, first full season on TOUR.  To win your first FedExCup Playoff event or to go and win it all, are these things you put in the back of your mind?  Would be a huge way to end this breakthrough year.  
JON RAHM: I try not to think about it too much.  I just try to focus on my game like I've been doing till now.  Certainly the closer we get to East Lake, I know the pressure is going to pile up and the more important it's going to be.  Hopefully I can get in that top five spot going into East Lake and be a little less stressed.
