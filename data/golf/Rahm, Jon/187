JON RAHM: It was great, the French crowd was great.  The first hole felt like a really warm welcome.  It was nice.  I am from Spain so I've always had a great relationship with France.  I love the condition try.  I spend a lot of time here.  I was very excited to get my start.  Luckily I shot under par, which is always a good thing.   
 Q.  How do you feel about the course?  The Ryder Cup is coming next year.  The course is very tough, isn't it?  
JON RAHM: It's very tough.  Especially if you play like me today; if you don't put it in the fairway, it's going to be so hard to play the golf course.  That's what makes it great.  It's not the longest course but it's really, really tough.  You need to keep it play and if you don't you're going to suffer a lot.  I think it's one of the most fun courses we play all year.
