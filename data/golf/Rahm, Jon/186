 Q.  We spoke to you a couple days ago and you said how good of condition this course was in and how you were looking forward to playing it.  Now you've played two rounds.  What are your thoughts and feelings over how you've played in two days?  
JON RAHM: Well, it's probably still in great condition.  I haven't seen the fairway too much; I haven't been able to evaluate.  It's still in pristine condition.  It's great.  Even with the rain delay and with the weather we've had, the course is still holding up, which shows the effort that the crew makes here and the volunteers and everything.   
My game off the tee, I wish it could be better.  I mean, I've been trying to fix it.  I don't know what's going on.  At least now I'm missing right instead of left which is something I can play with.  But I've been lucky to manage myself around and shoot under par twice, with only five fairways today and five yesterday, which is something that's pretty unusual here.   
 Q.  Only two dropped shots on the card and that shows how well you've played from those situations.  Just had that fantastic up-and-down from the front of the green on 18 to save a par.  
JON RAHM: Only one dropped shot today, which makes it more impressive.  On 18, even Adam told me, let's go make this one and end with a happy note.  I'm like, if I hit anything inside ten feet, it's a great shot.  I even had the water behind the hole in play.   
First of all, I still don't know how the ball ended up there.  But to hit it to tap-in distance was amazing.  I did not expect that at all.  It's one of those shots where you hit-and-hope a little bit and hope it stays in a reasonable distance.   
 Q.  Over the weekend, is this the kind of course you can chase on if you need to?  
JON RAHM: I think so.  You know, my ball-striking after the tee shot feels great.  My irons look good.  My short game feels great.  My putting feels great.  I've been making a lot of long putts.  Short game being the special one feeling, right.  So I feel like I can be aggressive.  I just need to give myself a chance to be on the fairway and maybe make some birdies.
