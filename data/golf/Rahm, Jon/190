Q. Great round today and you finished with a birdie.  How key was that you coming in with a little bit of momentum heading into tomorrow?
JON RAHM: Well it feels surreal to get my -- I don't know when the last time I made a bogey-free round --  but at this course, first ever, it's really something that I'm really amazed at.  Anything under par would have been amazing today, but birdieing 18, wow, I mean it's something I really can't believe.  Thanks to Rosey for giving me the read, it helped out a lot, but tomorrow will be a different day, but I got a lot of positives.  It's a scorable course, hopefully I'll get some confidence and I'll try to be careful again like I did today.
Q. You've been in the mix so much this year as a rookie in big situations, so is this something that is kind of ordinary to you now?
JON RAHM: Well I wouldn't say ordinary, but that's what I strive for, that's what I have in mind, trying to play my best golf.  Luckily I've been doing it very constantly, which is something that shows me I can do what I have to do properly in the practice and I'm able to apply it on the golf course.  I feel very fortunate this year to have played golf the way I have.  I wouldn't say it's routine or ordinary because it's like living the dream, but I don't want to get used to it, it's fun.
Q. Finally, I know you're close to Sergio, he got an ace at 17.  Did you hear that?
JON RAHM: We heard it.  Rosey was about to tee off and he had to back off.  I thought it was Adam Scott, I'm like, great, he's 8-under par or something like that.  And when I saw it was Sergio, I thought it was great, because I knew he was not having the best round he's ever had here and I'm like, hey, he had to do something special, it's a special place, it's a special year for him, so I'm pretty sure everywhere he goes now something special is going to happen.
