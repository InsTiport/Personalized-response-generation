 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: No, not at all.  No, not really.  I mean they made the decision.  I was very comfortable with it, very honestly.  It gets to a point where it's not up to me.  So again it was something unintended.  Something that was an automatic reflex, and I knew I was not improving my lie.  So it was something the rules officials -- no, it didn't affect me today.  I didn't play bad because of yesterday.  I played bad, like everybody else, because of the wind.  And that's how it is.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: Not that I know of.  I haven't been looking for them.  It would be foolish of me to go online and see what people are going to say about me, because it's going to be good and bad.  I haven't heard anything negative about it yet.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: No, not at all.  I mean spectators are wonderful with me.  No, nothing to complain about them so far.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: I don't think there's any other way to say it.  If it happens in the span of ten years, nobody will remember.  If it happens two tournaments in a row, yeah, it seems like a bigger deal than it really is.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: Yeah, exactly.  I wouldn't have won by the way I did if I wasn't comfortable with what happened, and if I was not on the same side as what happened.  If I felt that I deserve a penalty stroke, I would say it.  I'm an honest player.  This is one of the things that golf teaches you and we are role models.  None of us are trying to cheat, to gain strokes like that is not something -- at least it's not me, it's not the way I was raised, it's not the way any Spanish player really plays.  I don't think we're gaining anything from that besides a bad image.  And that's something nobody wants.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: Well, I mean, sometimes you get mad because you miss a shot and you're in a bad shot but it's funny -- there was a shot today on 8 and I was aiming 45 yards right off the pin, out of the rough, which the ball is going to examine out straight and it had no chance of hitting the green.  Almost missed it ten yards left.  I was mad at the shot.  But there's nothing you can do but laugh because sometimes it's funny.  It's so uncontrollable that -- and Adam does a good job with that.  He tries to keep on smiling and give me some hope.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: Well, I mean if you're not smart enough to make a 40-footer off the green, there's something wrong with you, obviously.  I'm not happy about the bunker shot because it's not what I had in mind.  I thought I got it better.  It landed about six feet too far because it had spin.  But once that happens, two putts from here, and it's amazing, and the ball goes in.  Nothing I can do but smile.  It's more than welcome.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: No, we moved on.  I told him yesterday, "Hey, you did what you had to do."  Obviously no hard feelings.  I'm not going to be mad at you, if you think -- he was actually trying to help me out.  He was trying to avoid me getting in trouble, if somebody saw it on TV or someone had it on his camera phone.  So I think he did it with the best intentions as possible.  And I told him I believe he felt bad I had to go through it.  But, hey, we're in here together.  I was not mad at him.   
We didn't talk about it today at all, it didn't come up.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: Well, there were two rules officials there.  There's nothing that I can say that will change what the rules officials think.  If they think -- I don't know what was going on.  I think I got a free relief from the path.  If it's deemed to be a path where you can get a drop, and it's in your stance, go ahead.  Whatever the rules are, they're out here to help us.  I was kind of curious, because I saw him drop four or five times, because I was guessing he couldn't drop behind the tees.  Besides that I was just looking, hoping to keep going.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
JON RAHM: We just didn't know what was going on.  We didn't know if he was taking an unplayable.  If he was taking free relief.  We didn't know what was going on, that's all.
