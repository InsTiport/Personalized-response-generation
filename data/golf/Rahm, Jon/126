 Q.  How happy with the bounce back today?  
JON RAHM: Happy to make the cut and be under par today.  This scores aren't as low as I think a lot of people would have predicted.  I never thought they were going to be too low because the course is extremely firm and it's difficult to make putts.  Once we make the cut, seven back, a lot bigger margins have been made come backs from, Alex Noren being one of them last week.  You never know, hopefully make some putts.   
 Q.  Can you be aggressive out there?  
JON RAHM: I think I was about as aggressive as you can be today.  I hit driver on 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.  I didn't hit it on 9.  I hit it on 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18 -- I don't think you can be much more aggressive than I was today.  Besides the first three holes where I hit all fairway bunkers, kind of paid off.  I had short irons into the green, even sometimes I missed the fairway, I still had short irons into the green and a lot more control.  Hopefully keep going and get a few more shots close.   
 Q.  What do you think of this style of golf?  
JON RAHM: I love it.  Clearly when I deviate from that, I don't play as good, like yesterday.  6 is a perfect example, I get to that tee -- with the temperature not being, you know, that high, still warm for where we are but still high -- I'm thinking, do I hit an iron that's going to roll up close to the bunker, but I hit the driver -- if I carry it and get the right bounce, I'm going to have at least 30, 40 yards of roll.   
I hit the driver today and had just a wedge into that hole.  Like 15, I had a 56-degree wedge to the back pin.   
Tomorrow is a different day.  We'll see how it goes.   
 Q.  Definitely a challenge, the course?  
JON RAHM: It's very different.  The main reason why Portstewart worked for me -- most of the holes where I hit driver, there wasn't bunkers off the tee.  Realistically, the first few bunkers off the tee that came into play were 10 and 11 and they were quite off-line.  With that being said, I was free.  I was just being a little lucky and to be honest, last year, I made a lot of putts from 30 feet.  I made two or three each round.  That's always going to help a lot.   
 Q.  Fans supporting you?  
JON RAHM: They are always great.
