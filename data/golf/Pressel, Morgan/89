 Q. Two key things I saw: 13th hole and 16th hole where you guys made birdie on both those holes. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, 13, we were on the tee, and she goes, if you put it on the green, I'll make it, and she did. And 16, she hit it tight, so it was a good match out there. Helen hit some phenomenal shots and fought hard. Suzann made that great putt on 17 to keep them in there. But we just played steady. We had one bogey today. It was kind of a silly bogey.
