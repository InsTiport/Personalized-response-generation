 Q.  I've got to ask about that shot on 18?  MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, it was crazy.  I kind of said to Rock, I said let's just call this like Webby.  I played it with Webby the year she did hole the shot from the fairway, and I can't believe it basically hit the hole.  I didn't exactly see it, but it certainly looked like it did.  So close.  But I mean, I gave it four good days, and I can't be too disappointed.   Q.  You're standing here watching as Brit hit the shot and got to see it.  I know she's a really good friend of yours.  Does it make it a little less stinging when it's one of your friends?  MORGAN PRESSEL: We've battled for four days, so I mean, she hit such an incredible shot into 18.  I don't even know if that will hold up.  Stacy can get there in two.  It's just a tough, tough finish we had with that wind.  I felt like we battled hard.  I certainly didn't have my "A" game this whole weekend, but I kind of fouled it around, and ended up shooting, I think, 3-under on the weekend, so I'll take it.   Q.  From what you've been able to do, I know you've been working on swing changes and different things.  To be able to be in contention all week and put together the performance, how much does this help you going forward?  MORGAN PRESSEL: Definitely, especially considering I feel like I'm stuck in the middle.  I'm kind of halfway to a new swing and halfway to my old swing.  As pressure builds, it kind of regressed a little bit.  I'm just really determined.  I see that it helps that I'm working on the right things and really determined to get back and work hard on fixing it so that I can get there fully, and I can really commit to some of the shots that I hit and hit a lot more fairways.  That's been my biggest struggle all year, especially this weekend it showed.  I missed a lot of fairways.  It's tough to judge some of these shots coming out of the rough.  So that's where I pay the price, but it was okay.   Q.  Does it help when you get these experiences, these Sunday nerves and that?  You've looked like we've seen you of old, sinking putts and kind of having that fire.  MORGAN PRESSEL: It was, yeah, it was awesome.  I mean, it's nice to be in contention.  That's why I play out here and that's what I want.  So if you would have told me after Singapore I would have a chance to win ANA, I don't know if I would have believed you.  But that's golf, I guess.  I don't know what else to say.  It comes and it goes. Right now I feel certainly good about my game.  I know that I can improve.  So that's always a good thing.  I don't feel I got everything possible out of my game.  I feel like there is a lot of room for improvement, so it's looking up.
