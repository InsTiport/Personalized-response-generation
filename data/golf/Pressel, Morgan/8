 Q.  How excited are you about the form you've produced here?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Definitely happy with the week.  I played fairly well all week.  I scored really well today even without having my best stuff, and certainly made a lot of good putts coming down the stretch.  It was fun to be in competition at the end, second group from the end at a major.  It's been a while since we've been in contention in a major.  Great partner, he's been through a lot with me over the last 10 1/2 years.  It's nice to be trending in the right direction.   
 Q.  What's the key difference?  Something in your swing?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, you can talk to that guy right there.  He's been definitely instrumental in really helping me, Martin Hall.  Just been able to have a lot more confidence in my ball-striking, and certainly have putted well and Ron Stockton has helped me a little bit with that, as well.   
Just a lot goes back to confidence.  A couple years ago, I didn't know where the ball was going.  So it's a little bit easier to play when you can stand over it and have a general idea of where it's going to end up.   
 Q.  Solheim Cup announcements coming up soon.  There will be captain's picks.  How much has that been on your mind?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: The only time it's on my mind is I wonder how long it's going to take somebody to ask me about it.   
I was out here trying to win major championships.  Solheim Cup, it is what it is.  I haven't played particularly well over the last two years, but certain final now, and whatever happens, happens.
