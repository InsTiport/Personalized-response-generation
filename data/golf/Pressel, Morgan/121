  Q.  You had sort of an up-and-down day.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, definitely.   
  
  Q.  You gave a couple away and you got them back at the end.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I was struggling there a little bit at the beginning, even still I guess for some reason very tentative on my putting.  Which is totally opposite of me.   
 But when I'm leaving 15 footers short, that's kind of a little bit of a struggle of the day.   
 Hopefully, tomorrow I can come out, I'm right in there, so I certainly haven't shot myself out of anything, I haven't given too many away and hopefully I can play well.   
  
  Q.  It's a very short night.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Very short night.  I should be in bed already.  About 10 minutes ago.   
  
  Q.  The two you made at the end probably give you more confidence for tomorrow.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Definitely.  Of course I would enjoy making two birdies so that I put myself right back in there and so hopefully I can play well tomorrow.  It's going to be a long day tomorrow too.   
  
  Q.  Confidence level?  What are you thinking about?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I'm hitting the ball well, striking it well, and so as always, pars are good and you don't get too worried about a bogey here or there, because you can make it up with a couple birdies out on this golf course.
