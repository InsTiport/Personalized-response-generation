   PAM WARNER:  Morgan, thanks for coming and joining us today.  You've had a great season so far this year and had your first win on the LPGA Tour at the Kraft Nabisco Championship.  Talk about your year so far. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  So far it's been pretty exciting.  It's been a little up-and-down, and obviously the Kraft was exciting, but I've really been working hard on my game so hopefully I can continue to play pretty well. 

 Q.  You just got off the course playing the Pro-Am.  Talk about the course here in Upper Montclair. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, it's an old-style golf course.  I think it was built in 1901 so it's pretty tight, tree-lined and narrow, and you've got to hit it straight.  In terms of my game, I think it suits my game pretty well, so we'll see. 

 Q.  Why does it suit your game so well? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Because I'm not the longest hitter out here, but I tend to hit the ball pretty straight usually.  On a golf course like this where the fairways are pretty tight, it's an advantage.  You know, hopefully I can narrow in my approach shots so I can make birdies, as well.  I've been putting the greens pretty well, too. 
 Hopefully I can put it all together this week.  That's what it's all about. 

 Q.  How is this different from Wykagyl? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I've never played Wykagyl, so I can't tell you.  I'm not the person to ask. 

 Q.  Talk about, for the younger players who are coming up in the last few years, how much Annika has kind of dominated the publicity for the LPGA and then, of course, on the course.  Do you guys feel like this is an opportunity, her being out for a while, to start to emerge from that kind of a shadow? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, I think that every story line out here is what's going to push the LPGA forward, where Annika will be back in a couple weeks hopefully and a lot of the younger players that are playing well and the older veterans that are playing well, too.  There's a bunch of new winners, first-time winners out here this year, and every bit of that is what's moving the LPGA forward.  So we're all getting our share of publicity. 

 Q.  Just curious with Lorena taking over No. 1, pretty much since you've been out here Annika has been No. 1.  What's your impression of Lorena and her game and how she handles things, and does it kind of show you that's somebody who's having terrific tournaments and that it's there for you, No. 1 in the world? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Lorena is a tremendous competitor and obviously a great player, and she is very, very consistent.  She hits the ball a long way.  She's an excellent putter.  And she just manages to put it all together more often than the rest of us.  She's very calm out there, and she's very composed when she's out there playing.  She's definitely somebody who I look up to, and that's where I want to be. 

 Q.  When you come to a new golf course, how much do you have to learn, or do you simply not try to over-analyze or what? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, I like to play the golf course.  That's one of my biggest -- I'd rather -- rather than sit on the range, I'd rather go play and learn the golf course.  So I've played this golf course three times, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  I just like to spend a little bit of time around the greens mostly, especially first looks, learning where to hit the shots.  But after that just spend a lot of time around the greens and just getting familiar with the golf course.  I mean, we have to learn them quick. 
 PAM WARNER:  Thanks, Morgan.
