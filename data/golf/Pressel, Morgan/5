MORGAN PRESSEL: You can look at it both ways, right? We got off to a poor start. We were down early and really fought back. And then we're up, square, up, square. It was kind of all over the place. We had the opportunity maybe a couple times to make putts to go ahead with a more commanding lead. And then Carlota made an amazing putt there on 17 to square the match heading into 18.   
A little bit all over the place. I feel like Marina and I played well together, we played well. And a half point, half point is a half point. Sometimes come Sunday half points are really important.   
 Q.  (Question about Marina)?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: She did. Marina was great today. Just in general, there's so much more adrenaline and emotion in this type of an event holes. I think the first few holes she was just trying to figure out how much extra she should play for her amped-up ability.   
I think we all struggle with that sometimes in this format. But she settled down, made some really incredible putts. And super clutch.
