  Q.  Morgan, a hard-fought round, what were your thoughts on that?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I just really didn't play that well today.  I had plenty of opportunities and just couldn't convert anything.   
 She was just a steady player today, didn't give up too many shots.  I just played terrible.   
  
  Q.  You backed off a few shots; what happened?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  The first time somebody's walkie-talkie went off, and the second time just the wind came up.   
  
  Q.  Playing so well coming in --   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I just didn't make the putts that I needed to.  I mean, I made a couple but I missed a lot of opportunities.  It happens.   
 There's a lot of putts that I missed and you've always got to expect in match play your opponent to make everything, and she made it.
