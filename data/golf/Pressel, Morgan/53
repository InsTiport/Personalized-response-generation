Q.   Morgan, very solid 70 today.   Kind of talk us through your round. 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Yeah, thank you.   I hit a lot of greens today and gave myself a lot of chances.   I definitely left some out there, and I kind of got hosed on one hole out there and a little unlucky, but that's part of it.   I was kind of proud of the way that I bounced back and got it back to 2‑under on the day. 

Q.   4‑under for the tournament going into the weekend.   What kind of momentum do you have? 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Well, I feel like I'm playing well, so I need to do more of the same.   I'm hitting my new Callaway X2 Hot driver really well, and it's kind of a tight golf course, so it's putting me in position to hit a lot of greens, and I just need to roll a few more putts in.
