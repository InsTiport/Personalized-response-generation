  THE MODERATOR:   Morgan, only one bogey out there.   How do you take that heading into tomorrow?   
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Definitely.   It was a tough day to play.   I think that the wind tomorrow is going to be pretty similar, about 20 miles an hour or so, and I was able to keep the ball in front of me really today.   I only hit a couple of poor shots, one on 13 where I ended up having to pitch out after a poor drive, but the wind is tough to club, but it's also tough to commit, and I think that I did a pretty good job committing to all the shots today, committing to my target lines.   Sometimes when you have an 8‑iron or a 9‑iron in your hand it's hard to aim 40 yards right of the pin and trust that the wind is going to bring it all the way back, but I did a pretty good job of that today, and going to need more of the same tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Morgan, how were you able to stay patient on a day when the wind is blowing and I guess the greens were getting a little‑‑ were not as good in the afternoon as they were in the morning?   
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Yeah, I think my patience was kind of tested on the first few holes where I had a few good birdie opportunities and didn't even really sniff the hole.   I just‑‑ Rock said the same thing to me, he said, just keep putting yourself in position, keep giving yourself birdie opportunities, and I ended up making a few.   But when you're missing four and five putts on the front nine from 10 feet for birdie, it can wear on you, but you've just got to say, hey, I made a good stroke, the greens bounced this way, that way.   
Sometimes the greens out here I think are extremely tough to read because they don't have a tremendous amount of slope.   I had a lot of kind of straight putts today, and where I want it to break a little bit left or a little bit right and instead it bounced a little bit left or right, so that made it more challenging.   But tomorrow the greens should be, I think, a little bit better than they were this afternoon because less people will be walking on them tomorrow, and just got to keep giving myself opportunities.   I know that I can make them if I put a good stroke on them.   
   
 Q.   In that same vein, how hard was it to just stay patient and focus after that bogey at 13?   You came back and held it together the rest of the way.   
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Yeah, 13 was‑‑ it wasn't necessarily a poor commitment.   It was just I got a little stuck on the swing off the tee, and I actually made a good probably six‑ or seven‑footer to save bogey.   I think that once that went in, my patience was fine because I'm like, okay, I got out of there with a bogey and didn't make double, and I know that I've just got to keep plugging along with pars coming in and ended up making a good birdie on 16.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts, your emotions about being in the lead going into tomorrow, being in that position, being the player that everybody is going to be shooting at tomorrow?   
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Yeah, I definitely am the one out there with the target on my back, but that's the thing about golf.   I'm just going to go out there and‑‑ I mean, it's obviously easier said than done, but my game plan so far has been working, and I'm really, really focusing on my golf swing right now, trying to make the best swing that I can on every shot, and really focus on what I'm trying to do and not so much about the results and the outcome, and I think that that's probably been helpful this week, and going to keep trying to do that tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Like you said, that is easier said than done.   Will you get away from it all tonight, not think about it?   What's your plan to not let thoughts kind of overwhelm you?  
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I mean, I guess the more that I am in that position, the more comfortable I am with it.   I think at the end of the day, you have to be comfortable with the results, the outcome, no matter what it is.   I feel like I'm in a good place, and I'm there, and no matter what happens tomorrow, I'm happy with my game and the direction that I'm heading.   Tomorrow is not the end of the world one way or the other, but I'm going to go out there and give it my best shot.   
   
 Q.   On 16 could you give us your yardage into the green, your club, and the length of the putt you made?  
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Yeah, I had‑‑ I think I had about 170 to the pin.   I didn't hit the best drive, but kept it away from that bunker.   The wind was really coming in hard left to right there, and then hit a 7‑iron to about 20 feet short, and that was the longest putt I made today, so that was fun.   
   
 Q.   Morgan, what's next for the Morgan Pressel Foundation?  
MORGAN PRESSEL:   We're really right now working hard.   We're hopefully going to have a research lab at Sylvester Cancer Center named in the foundation.   That's kind of next on the agenda.   We're still really working hard with the genetic testing center.   That's our big forefront, education, making sure that everybody in the community and around the world knows that these services are available and should be taken advantage of.   
Research is very, very important for the next‑‑ for 20 years down the road, but right now early detection is kind of what we scream at the top of our lungs and try to get people, especially at a higher risk of breast cancer, to get in there and get screened, whether it's genetic testing or their mammograms.   That's really‑‑ education is our biggest focus right now.   
   
 Q.   You said something today about having those early opportunities and not cashing in on them.   What was the key to sort of remaining patient?   Watching you on TV you were smiling a lot.   Some of the other players were kind of grumbling looking at the greens.   
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I mean, when you hit a putt a couple feet off the putter face and it hops up in the air, what are you going to do other than laugh?   I mean, you do what you can.   You make the stroke that you want to make, and I didn't always make perfect strokes today.   I'm not saying that.   I misread a couple putts here and there.   But I mean, I did what I wanted to do on the putts, and they hit a bump or did this and that.   Certainly, I even saw it from all the players out there were just, like you said, kind of grumbling about when it hit bumps and didn't go in the hole the way they expected it to, and I just looked at Rock, like, well, there's another bump, hit another one.   What am I going to do?   You can't really control that.   
   
 Q.   Getting back to the work you're doing with your foundation, how important is it to keep getting the message out there for women to keep doing the preventative things, do self‑examinations, get mammograms?   I'm thinking more women younger than you are ‑‑ just hitting them over the head with that message.   
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I mean, for sure.   Breast cancer certainly has gotten a lot of publicity in the last couple of years with October Breast Cancer Awareness Month, everybody knows about it, wears pink and all that kind of stuff, but it's more than knowing about it, it's actually taking the initiative to go and get yourself checked.   I've seen women much younger‑‑ I know women much younger than I am who have been diagnosed with breast cancer when they never thought that it would have been possible.   
It's always something that I try and encourage young women to do, both young and old women.   It's a tough thing to worry about, especially if you have family history.   That's when you really have to be on top of it and be on top of your health because the best way, especially if you are diagnosed with breast cancer at an early age, it's probably a little bit more aggressive form of breast cancer, so that makes it even all that much more important.
