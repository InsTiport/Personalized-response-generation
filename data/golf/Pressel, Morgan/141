PAM WARNER:  Thanks for coming in and joining us today here in Orlando, pretty close to your hometown.  Just want to talk about being here?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, I'm really excited for me.  It looks like from the first two days, it looks like they have put a lot of effort into putting this event together.  It looks like it's going to be a great week.  It's a great golf course.  I know a bunch of friends there home are going to come out and watch.  It's going to be great.

The course is a fantastic course.  It's probably one of best courses that we'll play all year, and you know, it's a great setup, got some really great closing holes that anything can happen on.  And it's tough.  It's certainly not going to be a pushover.
Q.  Can you talk about coming into your rookie season so far and how things have gone?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I think that everything has gone pretty well so far.  I mean, obviously, you know, there are a few events where I wish I could have done better, and you know I know that like last week, I really hit the ball really solid tee to green and just couldn't put.  So I mean, I know that every week there's just that little bit that I need to work on and hopefully I can contend more often pretty soon.
Q.  Your stats look pretty good, putting kind of stands out, is that something that you've worked on a lot?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, you know, like I said last week, my putting was actually pretty atrocious.  And I tried out a new putter last week and that was snapped over my knee    not really, but I wanted to throw it in the garbage, and my grandpa said it have been okay, because I'm never using it again, so it wouldn't matter.

You know, I've got a different putter, I'm using still a two ball, but now with a new prototype, the same one that Phil Mickelson used to win The Masters.  And you know, I hope I'm stroking it well this week and fixing little things in my stroke and hopefully they will all go in this week.
Q.  What courses are you taking?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I'm taking basic English 12.  I haven't been in school in a while.  I have to go through my schedule.  (Laughing).  I'm making Marine Bio, which is pretty tough, I actually have to finish a test today.  I'm taking Digital Darkroom, 20th Century Ideologies and Conflicts, Economics and    I'm missing one, World Religion.
Q.  When do you graduate?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  May 20.
Q.  Inaudible?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  You have to take an athletic credit every year.  So my golf is in the fall, so I'm done with that.
Q.  What did you say about Mickelson, the putter?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  The insert is a prototype insert for a new Callaway Odyssey putters, the new insert.  I have it in a two ball.
Q.  You were born in Tampa not too far from here, how did you get started in golf?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, when I was 8, I moved to Boca Raton, where I live now and have been for a while.  My grandfather took me out, we were spending at his place for a couple of years, or we were settling in and trying to find a place to live and he took me out to play golf a couple of times and now he says that it was because I was too slow for tennis.  (Laughter).  So it just started there.  Just put the racquet down and now I'm playing golf.
Q.  What do you think of women's golf and the LPGA Tour, having young American players like and you Paula Creamer out here on Tour?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, I really hope it helps the Tour.  I think that everything, you know, storylines with Annika and trying to meet her goals and the young players that are coming out, all of the different players who have the capability to win every week, I hope that that really helps the Tour and makes it, you know, more of something that people want to watch, something that people can relate to.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens.  If something is going to happen, hopefully it will happen soon.
Q.  There are posters of you coming into the facility, Annika, Beth Daniel, great players, and you up there
MORGAN PRESSEL:  And me, it doesn't fit, is that what you're saying?  (Laughter).
Q.  What is that like for you?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  That was really cool.  When we were driving in, you know, there are all these great players, Annika, Cristie, Juli, Beth, Lorena, all of these great players and then there's a picture of me.  You know, it is quite an honor for them to put me up there, definitely.  That was very neat.
Q.  Inaudible?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I think it's really nice that she's here this week and I hope that she and her family have a great time.  I think that the course is going to play extremely difficult.  I hope she doesn't have    and I don't think she will have, you know, really high expectations but I hope she's just here to have fun, which I'm sure she will.
Q.  Inaudible?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, definitely, it's a subject that's close to my heart, so you know, I understand what she's going through and if this is a place where she can kind of get away from all that and have fun playing in a tournament like this, great.
Q.  Does it matter what she shoots?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  It doesn't matter what she shoots at all.  You know, she's here to have fun and that's all that it should be.
Q.  Have you seen her play?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I have not.  My sister knows her and has played with her.  I have not.
Q.  She gave you the scouting report?  (Laughter)?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  She told me to watch out.  She tells me to watch out for her, too.
Q.  You and Brittany Lang have been on the Money List, you guys are pretty close, are you looking at that at all, kind of keeping track at all?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, I mean, I want to see    the most important thing is how I'm doing with regard to everybody, because that's who is out here.  Everybody is out here.  It's not just rookies that are out here.  But, I mean, obviously I do look at that.  It would be    it's a nice short term goal to have, you know to, win Rookie of the Year, but it's not the most important thing, that's for sure.  And Seon Hwa Lee has definitely played really, really well and she's had some great finishes and played solid golf.
Q.  Do you have the time down for your graduation down to hours and minutes?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  No, I don't.  I know I have five days of classes that I have to go back for.  And then exams and graduation.  So I can't wait.  But I have plenty of work to do while I'm here and while I'm on the road, that's for sure.
Q.  How do you take a test when you're on the road?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  This one is a take home test.  But we also have a pretty strict honor code at the St. Andrews where I go to school.  A couple of teaches have, you know, said here is the test, study, and put it in an envelope or put it in the back of a binder and said, study when you're ready; it's an hour and a half, take it on your time and your honor.
Q.  Are you going to graduation?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yes, I'll be there, definitely.
Q.  Is there a prom?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  There is a prom, but I'm not going to that.  I'm going to be in Kingsmill for the Michelob Ultra Open.  I went to the prom last year.  It's overrated.  (Laughter).
Q.  Have you gone through any other equipment changes throughout this year?  I know you were starting the year with some new stuff.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well if you see, a couple new Callaway drivers back there    I've tweaked a few things, whether it's a shaft    mainly my driver.  I switched my 11 wood that I've used for two years.  The Callaway made a new 11 wood in the new X Series line which they were not originally to do.  I'm using that now and I like that.

But, you know, just switching different shafts.  These were a couple of drivers with a little less loft because I was hitting it a little high.  We'll see.  Just a little tweaking, nothing major, that's for sure.
Q.  What's the best advice you've received in terms of being a rookie out here?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I don't know if I've really talked to too many people about that.  I guess personally I don't really get too nervous, I don't really try to let the pressure affect me too much.  I put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed and to do well and that's really all that I'm worried about.
Q.  First time around, any rough idea what a good score would be?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  You can't    that's hard to predict.  Right now the greens are pretty soft but, you know, I'm assuming that they are going to get firmer and faster and I think it will be a tough test.  We'll see.  It's really hard to predict.  That's hard to tell.
Q.  Are you keeping up with your position in terms of qualifying?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I think I know where I am, 15th or something like that.  Yeah, I look at all that, I look at all the stats and position.  It's interesting to me.  I can't calculate it myself.  I have to wait to see them updating on Monday mornings.  I can't calculate that myself.  I don't even know the distribution of points or anything like that.  It's an interesting concept, so we'll see.
Q.  Inaudible?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I got them in Palm Springs.  So they are somewhat new.  They are recent.
Q.  Inaudible?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I think the idea of the Big Sister Program for rookies is just so that new players have an outlet where they can, you know, ask about anything they want.  And it's just    it's just a person that I know that I can go to because    and I have known her for a while.  So not just through the Big Sister Program, but there are any other people I could ask whatever I need.  They would be there to answer my questions.
Q.  Inaudible?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I believe so.  I believe I believe so.
PAM WARNER:  Thanks, Morgan.
