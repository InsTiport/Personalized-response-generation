   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Morgan, thank you for joining us today.  You've had a great 2007 season and this is your first tournament back since playing as a rookie in the Solheim Cup.  You want to talk about your year and being here in Alabama this week.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, the year so far has been pretty good.  I had my first win at the Kraft Nabisco Championship earlier this year, and that was definitely a thrill.  It was a great honor to play on the Solheim Cup team last week, or I guess two weeks ago.  That's definitely an experience I'll never forget.  We really had a great time there.   
 Looking forward to the rest of the season.  Hopefully I can continue to play well.   
  
  Q.  How is the course treating you so far?  You've had a couple practice rounds in the Pro-Am today.  What are your thoughts?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, had a couple practice rounds early in the week and the course played pretty long.  I was here for a pretty bad storm on Sunday night and got quite a bit of rain.  It's dried out a bit and it's playing a little bit shorter so I don't have to hit 3-wood on to almost every green anymore.   
 It's playing long.  It's a tough golf course.  The greens are huge, so I think that's going to be a big key:  Keeping it on the right level, things like that.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, I mean, I just know that I played well.  I know that I really -- I mean, nobody necessarily I guess expected me to win except for myself.  I kind of knew that I could play well.  And I go out against anybody hoping to win and playing well and knowing that I can win.   
 So to play their best player was great.  It was great for me.  I really wanted to play their best player and be put out late in the lineup or wherever.  Just against somebody I could really make an impact on with the team, and I think that the whole team played great.   
 So that was -- it was so much fun to walk down the fairways and see the sea of red that was on the leaderboard.  1-up, 2-up, 3-up, so it was exciting.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  It was pretty ugly.  But I will say that everybody who I've talked to has mentioned, Wow the weather was terrible.  It takes me a second to think about how bad the weather really was, because I've almost forgotten about the weather.  All I can remember is how much fun we had and winning and things like that.   
 It was pretty bad and ugly.  The worst was Sunday morning when we had to finish our Saturday foursomes match and -- our four-ball match, and I had to wear my rain gloves for nine holes.  It was pouring and freezing.  It was pretty miserable.  I had like four layers on, long sleeves.  It was cold.   
 And as a little girl from South Florida, we don't get to too often.  I had somebody there ask me when I practice in the weather and I said, Only when I come here.  I said, I don't really get to practice in this much.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I think it's great.  She's been playing some fantastic golf, and I think that she hasn't just won the tournaments she's almost ran away with all three of them.  She's really on top of her game and playing well, and I think it's just going to take somebody else who's on top of their game.   
 I mean, not everyone is going to play fantastic every week, but you can never count her out.  Hopefully I can play well, too.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's right.  I remember that.  I also remember that they cut that tournament short because I think it was Hurricane Ivan, right?  So we went home a day early so instead of having another say I ended up losing in a playoff, I think.   
 I remember that golf course, and I'm excited to go back there now that I've qualified for the Tournament of Champions so that will be fun.  This is a great golf course.  You can tell similarities between them, but the settings are totally different and it's a totally different golf course.  You can kind of see similarities.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I don't think that the lie -- I mean, I think that the fairways are fairly generous.  A lot them kind of bowl in.  There are some pot bunkers that you really don't want to get in.   
 If you miss the fairway there's not a ton of rough.  Just mostly a side-hill lie or an awkward stance, things like that.  I think you're hitting fairly long shots into really big greens, so it's keeping it on the proper area of the green.   
 I mean, there's not too much that have a real shelf, they've just got some mounds and some rolls and hills, and you got to pay attention to that.   
 I think that sometimes if the pin is over this big ridge you'd rather be maybe long chipping back up than putting over the ridge.  I think that's another thing.  Lag putting is going to be huge.  Minimize 3-putts this week for sure.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  That's kind of a tricky hole.  It's a little bit of an awkward hole just because there's not much of a landing area for the second shot and you got to kind of lay back and still have a pretty long shot in.   
 If they move the tee up, like they've kind of got two setups for the tee.  If they move the tee up there's a little bit more linear, but it's just still just kind of an awkward second shot there.   
 The green is tough.  You need to hit three good shots.  I hit driver, 5-wood and 8-iron in today, so it's not often that you hit an 8-iron into a Par 5.  But that's kind of the way the hole sets up.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Actually, interesting that you ask me that.  I just watched the final round -- when was it?  Saturday?  Last week?  We were kind of looking at some old TiVo footage that Papa has, that my Grandfather has on his TV and we saw that.  I was like shaking watching it because I knew it was going to happen.   
 It almost felt to me like watching my uncle play in his match against Jimmy Connors, Aaron Krickstein, one of the most famous matches and one of the most replayed matches during the US Open.  I kind of felt that way.   
 Like every time I watch that match I hope the outcome changes and it's the same thing.  Well, maybe this time the shot won't go in.  But, you know, I mean, I watched it and I just kind of watched the progression and how two years have changed things and I'm a different player and I approach the game differently.   
 I still got mad over a few of the shots I hit.  I'm like, I would never hit that shot now.  That was so bad.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, when I see her -- I don't see her that often, but when we do I say, Hi.  There's nothing.  I mean if you're looking for dirt there's nothing there.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Thank you.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  It's kind of pinkish.  It's not really -- I mean, everybody's been asking me is this Auburn or is it Gators.  I say it's UVA.  My best friend goes to UVA, so we'll make everybody in this area happy and say it's UVA.   
  
  Q.  (No microphone.)   
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, we got the Gator fans.  Thanks guys.
