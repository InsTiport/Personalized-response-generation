   PAM WARNER:  Morgan, thanks for coming in and joining us today.  Another great round out there.  You're currently three shots off the lead.  You have to feel like maybe it's kind of similar to a few months ago at Kraft? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, obviously it's a little different.  The golf course is giving up a few more birdies than the Kraft golf course did.  But in that sense, I can draw on experiences and just go out and play golf tomorrow and see where that puts me. 
 PAM WARNER:  What was working for you out there today? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, I hit the ball -- my iron play was really good today.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities from, you know, 15 -- 10, 15 feet for birdie.  I actually didn't convert very many of them.  Other than that, and my driver was just a little bit off today.  I was hitting them just a little bit left so I have to go work on that on the range.  And hopefully I can drop a few more putts tomorrow. 

 Q.  Do you know much about Min?  Did you play against her in junior golf at all? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  No. 

 Q.  Do you know anything about her? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  No. 

 Q.  Come on. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  No, I really don't. 

 Q.  Did you recognize the name when it was on the board? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I did not. 

 Q.  Does it change your approach at all, chasing a leader that you know nothing about? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I don't think so.  Because I think I'm still behind, and I've still got to play aggressively tomorrow, play for birdies, but not play stupid aggressive. 
 If I play well, whether -- no matter how she plays, I'll still say that I played well and whatever happens, happens.  I've just got to go out and play my game.  I know that sounds like a clich√©, but it's true.  I've got to try to, anyways. 

 Q.  Will you need some help? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Do I need some help?  Are you trying to ask me what you asked me -- (laughing). 
 I don't know.  Help?  A little bit of help never hurts. 

 Q.  Considering the situation do you need as much as you did last time?  Do you feel like you have a little bit better position -- 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I feel like I'm playing better.  Obviously I played very well Sunday at the Kraft, but this week, I feel like I've played better for three days.  You know, I know that -- I just know that every day I look back at the shots that I left out there, and obviously you don't like to think negatively on that; but more positively, like how many shots I can makeup tomorrow. 
 Think the golf course is a little bit different in that sense tomorrow because it is giving up more birdies. 

 Q.  Even though you didn't know the name, were you surprised to see 65 on a day like this? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Absolutely.  That's one heck of a goal.  She definitely golfed her ball pretty well today.  That's very impressive. 

 Q.  Can you talk about the conditions today, how difficult they were? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, it's more -- in that sense, when it's windy like that, you have to focus a lot more on alignments because you're not always aiming at the pin and you're not always playing for the yardage at the pin.  And so you've just got to really think a lot more about each shot. 
 A couple of times, like on 7 and 8, I took almost two or three clubs more than I would hit in the situation because it was that heavy into the wind.  But other than that, I don't think it affected as much on the back nine.  I think it calmed down a little bit. 

 Q.  Do you find yourself anticipating having any problem tomorrow keeping your focus on what to do and not let it wander to, hey, this is two legs to the Grand Slam? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I hope not.  I don't think so.  Every tournament is a different tournament.  I want to win this tournament just as -- just as much as whether I had won the Kraft or not.  Whatever happens, happens.  I can't think about it like that. 

 Q.  And also, of the top 5 or six on the board, there's you and Angela Park who is 18 and you're 19; what does that say about the State of women's golf? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I think we've seen it recently, it's definitely getting younger.  It's great, it's great for the Tour and it's not just us.  There are plenty of other good players out there, too. 

 Q.  Have you found a driver that works now for you? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I have.  I finally got exact replica of the driver that I used at the Kraft.  Last week I started playing it.  It's an FT-3, a Callaway FT-3.  Today I struggled a bit, but it wasn't the driver; it was just my swing. 

 Q.  So last week was the first week that you played with it? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  With this exact driver, yes.  But it was the kind of thing where I had been searching for the shaft and the head to make it exactly like it was before, because I wasn't really as happy with anything that I had been testing. 
 And I was on the range at Trump in Palm Beach and I hit like my first drive on the range, and I said, "This is it."  It was like right away I knew that it was just that much better than what I had been playing.  So it's a great club. 

 Q.  How many did you go through since the Kraft? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I don't even know.  Probably about ten.  I made different lofts, different shafts, different center-of-gravities on the club.  We tried everything.  Different heads even.  FT-3s, FT-5s.  This is just one that suits my swing the best. 
 PAM WARNER:  Can we go over your scorecard? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  2, I hit a lob-wedge to about eight feet. 
 Bogey on 3, I 3-putted from about 12 feet.  That was excellent.  I was quite happy about that. 
 Bogey on 4.  I missed the green right with a gap wedge, and then I short-sided myself, had about a 15-foot par putt that just slid by. 
 Birdie on 6.  I hit a pitching wedge to about six feet. 
 Birdie on 10.  Pitching wedge again to about 15 feet.  Maybe a little less than that. 
 Birdie on 17.  I hit a four hybrid to ten feet. 
 PAM WARNER:  Thanks, Morgan.
