   PAM WARNER:  Morgan, thanks for coming and joining us today.  You've had a great season so far.  You won your first tournament at the Kraft Nabisco championship, major championship, six other top-five finishes.  Just talk about how you've played this year. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  So far this year has been pretty good.  I've been pretty consistent, playing well.  Obviously everybody has their up's and down's, and I've had better tournaments than others, but it's been a lot better this year than it was last year, that's for sure. 
 PAM WARNER:  You played here last year.  Talk about that. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I love it.  It's really nice.  It's cooler than it was last year; last year I remember we were boiling, but it's a beautiful spot. 
 I enjoy being here a lot.  I don't speak French so it's a little difficult for me, but it's a beautiful golf course and great sponsor and great tournament. 

 Q.  Do you still work with Martin Hall? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yes. 

 Q.  Do you see him regularly?  What was the last time -- 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  He's here.  About five minutes ago; we were working on the range.  He's here because Lisa Hall qualified, so he's here.  That's nice. 

 Q.  The Evian Masters has a new format with an increased number of players and the cut on Friday.  How do you feel about this new format?  Do you like it, and do you think it contributes the Evian Masters as the fifth major championship? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I haven't really paid too much attention to -- obviously there is a format change, but it's just a slightly bigger field, and it's still a limited field, still tough to get in.  It's still a tournament that everybody wants to have on their schedule, so I don't think that changes from an increased field or a cut. 
 But everybody wants to play here, especially before the British.  It's a great tune-up and it's a great spot.  A lot of fun. 

 Q.  What were your goals for the season before the season started?  And how have you had to adjust them after your great win? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  My goals at the beginning of the season were to just to try to improve upon last year, just really work to learn from the mistakes that I made last year, and I didn't really set a goal where I was.  I didn't set goals, like I wanted to win by May.  I don't think you should set them too high or limit yourself, but throughout my whole career I wanted to continue to improve and use the experience that I have to try and not make the same mistakes again. 
 In that sense, I just need to keep improving every week.  I know what I have to do -- I look back on what I did and what I've done wrong and just try and not really tweak the way that I play but just every -- it's minor, it's a very minuscule difference between being top-twenty and top-five.  It's just a couple shots here and there, and you could be right in the tournament. 
 And I think that's a big thing that's a change from last year to this year.  Actually other than last week, where I didn't have my best tournament, every other event this year I have improved upon my performance from the year before, so that's been pretty cool.  So I've played a lot better this year. 

 Q.  Not to detract from this week, but have you played golf in Britain, and more specifically have you played it St. Andrews? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I have not played at St. Andrews; the only opportunity I had last year was at the British.  I had a great time.  I had too much trouble in the bunkers, so it wasn't my best week, but that was my first experience with a true links-style golf course, and I'm really looking forward to next week. 

 Q.  You say that you've managed to improve every week on last year's finishes.  Forgive me, where did you finish here last year, and what do you need to do this week to make similar improvement here? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I did not play well last year, I remember that.  I think somewhere in the 20s, I'm not sure. 
 PAM WARNER:  25th. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, I did not play well here last year.  It was a bit of a mess.  I had a tough time in the middle of the season last year where I struggled quite a bit, and this, unfortunately, fell in the middle of that. 

 Q.  What do you need to do to win here? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I'm not here to win this week; I don't look to -- I just look to improve on the 25th finish and just play well.  Working on my swing, solid contact.  I wasn't the best that I could have been today, but it is Wednesday, so hopefully by Sunday all the putts will fall, and I'll hit them, hopefully tomorrow, too. 
 PAM WARNER:  Thank you, Morgan.
