RHONDA GLENN:  Morgan, you are where you wanted to be, in the finals of the U.S. Women's Amateur Championship.  How does it feel?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Oh, it feels great.  Definitely I played really well this week and the only thing more that I could ask for is the trophy.
RHONDA GLENN:  Only 36 holes to go.  Everybody wants to know about the eagle on No. 10, what was your yardage and what club did you hit and what were your thoughts?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  It was  92 yards, and my caddie said just play 85, 87 in the air, it was a little down breeze and it would be perfect.  She skipped it, so just put it in there tight.  And when I hit it, some guy standing behind me was like, "Oh, go in, go in," and it was like just taking off.  I'm like, "What are you talking about?"  (Laughter).

I could see it, it was like bouncing around on the pin.  It was exciting.
RHONDA GLENN:  What did you think when it went in the hole?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  It was just an added bonus; it was great.
RHONDA GLENN:  Pretty good crowd following you around.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Great crowd out there and a lot of support.  It was nice.
RHONDA GLENN:  Do you thrive on spectators?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, I like it, it's fun.
Q.  Is it nice to hole something out on a hole like that, and maybe after what's happened in the last two USGA events for you?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, any time you can get the ball in the hole, it's a good thing I guess.  From the fairway it was definitely exciting.
Q.  Have you ever holed a shot like that before?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  In a major, I don't think so.  But I think I have before.  I mean, I know I have before.
Q.  You had like three lip outs before that, too, and you holed out a wedge from the fairway.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I was a little shaky on my 5 , 6 footers.  A couple of them I hit a little too hard and they just came right back at me, a few lip outs, but it happens and you move on.
RHONDA GLENN:  Can I ask you about footages on your birdie putts.  No. 5, it was about 12 feet on the par 3.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  It was, yeah.
RHONDA GLENN:  6?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  About 15 feet.
RHONDA GLENN:  16?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  That was about five feet.
RHONDA GLENN:  And 17?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  About 15 feet.
RHONDA GLENN:  Any idea how you're going to feel tomorrow going into the final?  I mean, you've won lots of stuff.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, I'm just going to have to play well, and I expect her to play well, too.  I'm just excited and we'll see what happens tomorrow.
RHONDA GLENN:  Have you played with Maru before?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  No.
Q.  Was there any concern going into 10 at the turn?  You had lipped out those putts, and she stuck that shot and you were standing over your ball.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I was just, you know, just hit it close because I've been hitting pretty good wedges all week, and it's like, just hit it inside of her.  That's just some part of the mind set when you play match play is when a player hits a good shot and you're hitting second, you want to try and get it even closer, as if their shot isn't as good anymore .

So I just wanted to put it inside of her and just of halve the hole with birdie but I got a little lucky.
Q.  Did you learn anything about playing 18 here?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  No.  I just had not played it in a couple of days.
Q.  Can you talk about the little pitch shot you had on 12?  You made a nice up and down.  You probably got one of those little 4 footers to kind of go in for you there.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, well, that was a straight putt luckily.  I didn't hit it quite as hard.
Q.  The lie was pretty bad?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  It wasn't a great lie, but I had plenty of green to work with.  I figured if it got up somewhere and landed on the green, it would run through to the pin.
Q.  Not a lot of gimmie putts?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Not much.  I don't give much.  They make me putt it, hopefully I'll make it.  I'm a pretty good short putters, so I don't have any problems not giving short putts.
Q.  What would it mean to win this tournament?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Oh, it would mean a lot obviously.  I mean, it's the most prestigious amateur event, and, you know, I've played really well this week.  So hopefully I can close the deal tomorrow.
Q.  Are you tired at all?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I'll tell you tomorrow afternoon.  I haven't thought about that yet.
RHONDA GLENN:  JoAnne Carner, who won five of these things, said that when she played she would go home and go to bed for two weeks because she was so exhausted.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  I've got another tournament next week, North and South.
RHONDA GLENN:  Defending, right?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yes.
Q.  Your caddie, I guess you picked her up at Kingsmill on the last day; your caddie had blisters or something?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, he wasn't going to be able to make it because we had a 36 hole last day because of bad weather.

She's been great.  She's been terrific.  She worked with me at Chick Fil A and the Open and the Toledo event, all of my LPGA events, and I just asked her to come and join me here.
Q.  What kind of chemistry have you developed?  She says she keeps you loose and you laugh all the time.
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, we laugh a lot and she keeps me loose.  She's very precise she works really hard.
Q.  What's her name?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Sam Hinshaw.
Q.  Are you going to keep her around for a while?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Looks like it, yeah.
Q.  The putt she missed on 16, that was big, too, the little slider she had?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, that was big.  She took a lot of time over that putt.  It almost looked like she was doubting herself and I almost had a feeling she might miss it.  Definitely wasn't expecting it.  She's a great putter.  She didn't putt spectacularly well today, which is unusual, but sometimes that happens.
Q.  Sam mentioned maybe a couple of putts you had early in the round, your tempo was off a little?
MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, I was hitting them too hard.  I mean, I guess it's a combination of everything, but I was just hitting them a little hard.
RHONDA GLENN:  Thank you so much, Morgan.  Congratulations and good luck tomorrow.
