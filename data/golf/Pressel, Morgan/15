 Q.  What was your first impression of the golf course?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Oh, I think it's a great track.  It's fun to be on a golf course that has so much history, a lot of -- you know, it's old school.  I've always loved old-school golf.  It's kind of on a tight property.  Tees and greens are close, small greens.  Puts a little bit more emphasis on precision both off the tee and into the greens, and you've got to have a good short game around here, which I've been practicing a lot.   
 Q.  So it's showing?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah.   
 Q.  Tell me about your year so far.  What's working now that's sort of rounding you into form?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: It's been a little bit all over the place.  I've tried to not focus too much on every day today and more as a long-term progression and not my goals that I'd like to accomplish.  I'm trying to get my game back in shape, my swing back on plane.  I went back to working with Martin Hall this year, so we've been working really hard, so it's been great working together again.  I really love the direction that we're heading.  It's not there yet, but every day I feel like I get closer.  It's heading in the right direction, so I definitely feel a lot more positive than I have, I would say over the last couple years.  I have certainly more confidence for sure, more confidence in what we're working on and more confidence in myself.   
 Q.  Is he saying things to you that were harkening back to your youth?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Oh, for sure, there are still some things.  Old habits are hard to break.  There are still some things that we're still working on that I remember working on when I was 10 or 11, so for sure.   
 Q.  If you could boil it down to like one thing, is there one thing --  
MORGAN PRESSEL: The biggest thing is my swing plane.  I knew that since I was a kid, swing plane was so important, and that's really something that I knew that he could help me and want to help me get back, with the club in front of me.  My clubs had really gotten way too far behind and underneath, so every day, trying to inch it more on plane.   
 Q.  When did you stop working with Martin Hall?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: That's a good question.  I don't exactly remember.   
 Q.  You were a pro, though, right?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, I was.  Maybe my third year on Tour.  I'm not positive.  It was a long time ago.  I don't exactly remember.   
 Q.  Three birdies in a row, nice little stretch there.  Give me the highlights.  
MORGAN PRESSEL: For sure.  Good putts.  Hit a good shot in on 15, good putt on 16, and good putt on 14.  Kind of three birdieable holes with some shorter irons in, but like this course is all about where you leave it, so if you leave it in the right place, you can get aggressive with the putt towards the hole, and if you're not in the right place, you almost have to putt with the head cover on to try and get it to stop.   
 Q.  When you talk about long-term, how long-term are we talking, what you guys are planning or thinking?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: As long as it takes.  Some days it's more frustrating than others, but I know where I want to go and what I need to do to get there.  Just takes a little bit of time and some reps, and then a whole 'nother step to take it to the golf course.   
 Q.  When did you start working with him last year?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: In the fall, August.
