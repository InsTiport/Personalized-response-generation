 Q.  Well, I guess first of all how would you describe the round? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I played a lot better today.  I hit some good shots and then -- I hit a lot more good shots, a lot more close, had some really close birdie putts.  I mean, I holed one out on 10.  I mean, I still even missed a couple.  But I made a few too many mistakes today. 

 Q.  What happened on 10?  It was an eagle, right? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, I holed out from 83, 85 yards, something like that. 

 Q.  One sort of thing that all the women are saying is they feel like they can get their rounds going but they just can't handle these greens. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  The greens are sometimes, yeah, difficult to read.  I missed two pretty short putts today, one here on the last hole.  But it happened. 

 Q.  Would you like to turn in at least just one more round? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Oh, no.  We need to erase the first round, that's really what we need to do. 

 Q.  You had a 66 almost, a bogey on 18.  Explain 18 for us. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Just three-putted.  There's not too much to explain.  I hit my first putt too hard. 

 Q.  Everybody seems to be playing 18 on the right side of the green.  Is there some reason why they're not going to the other side or short of the green? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, the left side is not very much fun, either.  It's a tough hole.  You'd be better off on the right side.  Maybe I'd have two-putted. 

 Q.  In all honesty, how would you describe this tournament in comparison to other Tour stops? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  It's a fantastic tournament.  CN does a great job.  They're a fantastic sponsor for this event.  It's their second year, and they've really brought it up in terms of one of the premier events on our schedule.  That's why they have such a great field here. 

 Q.  How about this golf course and Edmonton in general as a place to come for the CN Canadian Women's Open? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Well, I'm very impressed by the crowds out here, the golf course is great, and I think we've all had a great week here.
