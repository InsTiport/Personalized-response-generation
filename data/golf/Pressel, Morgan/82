   MORGAN PRESSEL: It was pretty poor out there. I had a lot of opportunities on the front nine and was hitting a lot of lips, and on the back nine just kind of -- everything disappeared. I couldn't make a 5-footer, so I'm going to go work on it and hopefully play better tomorrow.  
  
  Q. How difficult is it going into the final round tomorrow to not think about all the edges you're going to hit?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, I just gotta have some sort of thought for my putting to be a little bit more not aggressive shot, but more confident.  
  
  Q. Okay, Morgan. Thanks for your time. Good luck tomorrow.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: It's hard standing over a putt and they're in your ears and it's horrible.   
 I wanted to take off my rain pants, but I would have just gotten torn on part.  
  
  Q. Have you ever seen them like that in your life?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: No. That was definitely the worst I've ever experienced.  
  
  Q. Do you think it affected your play?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: No. I don't think it affected my play. I just had to back off a lot of shots.  
  
  Q. Do you think you had a lost opportunity out there today?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Oh, yeah. I mean I'm not happy with how I played.  
  
  Q. You got to 7-under at one point and looked like you were going to take a real run at the lead.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Yes.   
  
  Q. Was there something -- one part of the game today that just kind of left you?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Um, you know, I'm struggling with my timing on my full swing, and on the last few holes my putting was just atrocious.
