   MORGAN PRESSEL: I wasn't tremendously sharp today, but I gave myself good chances and made some good saving putts on holes where it got a little away from me on the back nine.   
 I started just to come out of my shots a little bit. Everything was right, but I mean a few good par saves.   
  
  Q. Did you get the sense that it was going to be tough and it was just a matter of taking your pars when you can and battling?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Oh, for sure. It's a major championship. It's not quite as difficult as the U.S. Open, but pars are still a good score and you take birdies when you can get them. I managed to birdie three of the par-5s today, and that helps.  
 I guess I just didn't give up. I started -- I started to swing poorly, but I at least still put the golf ball in the fairway and gave myself a good chance at every hole.  
  
  Q. Having won here, I'm sure is always a help, huh?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: For sure. I would have liked to jump in that pond walking by 18 today. It would have been a nice cool- off, but a couple days too early.  
  
  Q. How long were your putts on the last few holes that you made?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: The last hole was about 18 feet, 20 feet. The hole before was about five or six feet. 7 was about 10 feet. 6, I missed about a three-footer for birdie which was a bit of a bummer, but then I guess you make a 10-footer for par on the next hole, so it evens out.
