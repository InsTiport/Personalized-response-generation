Q. You've recorded top 10 finishes here in your two appearances.  What is it about Wilshire Country Club that brings out the best you?
MORGAN PRESSEL: I don't know.  That might be my only Top 10s in the last three years.  (Laughter.)  I was thinking about this on the last couple holes, how differently I played both years.
Last year I was really squirrely with my ball striking.  Wasn't really confident, but managed to kind of scrape it around.  Putted really, really well.  Got up and down from everywhere.
This year I hit a ton of fairways and a ton of greens and missed so many birdie opportunities, but still managed to make a few and just played really steady golf this week.
Q. What's it like when you're able to find your game like that and be able to play so steadily throughout the week?
MORGAN PRESSEL: It's refreshing considering I was really frustrated on Tuesday.  I played terribly in practice and just kind of had a bad attitude.
Just tried to not be quite as perfect this week and relax a little bit.  Was able to have better results.
Q. You talk about the differences in your game the last two years.  Were there any differences to you maybe of how the course was?
MORGAN PRESSEL: I think the course played fairly similarly to last year:  firm and fast off the fairways.  The greens are poana and you can get some interesting bumps.  They're tough to read.  Everything breaks away from the Hollywood side.  There is the affect of the general topography here.
It's a quirky golf course that you have to play smart.  I managed to do that.
Q. Do you like the toughness of it?
MORGAN PRESSEL: I definitely prefer a golf course like this where you don't have to make a million birdies throughout the week.  Par is a good score.  I've always preferred tougher setups, and that probably part of the reason why I played well.
Q. For you, when it's getting a little bit tough out there, what do you say to yourself focus in on what you need to do?
MORGAN PRESSEL: I just this week tried to stick to the game plan.  Good tempo.  I mean, it's easy -- especially I haven't been in contention much lately, so coming down the stretch you get a little nervous, heart starts going a little bit faster.  Remember to breathe and keep the tempo easy, because things start to get quicker when you get under the gun.
Q. First top 10 since 2016.  How do you react to that?
MORGAN PRESSEL: You know, I played well this week.  I feel like I played golf that can carry me further throughout the rest of the year.  It's been a struggle the last couple years for sure.  Not the golf I wanted to play.  Been going through some swing changes with Martin Hall, my coach.  Nice to see them finally take a little bit of a hold.
Q. What's been the biggest change you've worked on in your swing?
MORGAN PRESSEL: At the end of the day, the easiest way to explain it is I'm just trying to get the club in front of me.  I tend to get it a little bit behind me.  Coming down and just trying to keep the club in front of me, straighten out my swing plane a little bit.
