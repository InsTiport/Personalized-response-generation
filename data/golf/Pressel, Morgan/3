 Q.  Many highlights in your round but how about the start to the back nine?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: It was nice. A little sand wedge from about 111 yards. We couldn't see it. The crowd went crazy. Wasn't sure if it was really close or went in, but when we got on, there wasn't another ball on the green. Nice way to start, and I had already been playing well for the day. Just kept it rolling.   
 Q.  67 and four back going into the weekend. What is your mind-set knowing you're four behind and the players that are ahead of you?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, there's a whole other half of the tournament to go. More of the same. This golf course really demands a lot of ball control, especially with the wind. There's a lot of crosswinds, and just really controlling the distance that you carry the ball, and I just plan to kind of the same game plan and make a few more putts.   
It's awesome out here. The fans have been wonderful all week, and especially today, there were really a ton of fans out there and it's great to see the crowds come out and watch us play here in Taiwan.
