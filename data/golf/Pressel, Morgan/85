   MODERATOR: We're here with Morgan Pressel great round today, 67; you're the leader in the clubhouse at 11-under par. Can you walk us through your round.  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, I got off to a good start. Birdied the first hole. Made a little bit of a mess on 3. More of a mental error than anything. Just shouldn't have hit driver off the tee and made bogey.  
 I mean, I had chances. I had chances on 5, 6.  
 7 I made birdie.   
 Chances on 8 and 9.   
 10 was a short chance that I missed.   
 11, 11 I had a great up-and-down. That was probably the best hole of the day. That was only the second green that I missed, and got up-and-down from a short to a back left tough pin.   
 And then 12, I was I kicking myself because I missed another short birdie putt.   
 And 13 and 14, managed to roll a couple in. I mean, I hit it good. I was close and had a lot of chances.   
 18 was a nice cap there.  
 MODERATOR: What did you hit into 18?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I hit a 3-hybrid; it was about 204 yards.  
 MODERATOR: And the putt was ten feet?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Six feet.  
 MODERATOR: Can you talk a little bit about your round yesterday, because you started out well, hit a bogey stretch, and then brought it back. How important was that in yesterday's round to help you for today?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, I got a little quick with my golf swing yesterday in the middle of the back nine. Maybe even just got a little tired. We were out here forever, especially with the delay and com ing in and out and feeling like we might die out there.   
 But, um, it was a long day, but birdieing 17 and just to get it back at even par for the day was big yesterday evening. Got a good night's rest, and came out ready to play today.   
 MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. What would it mean to win here tomorrow?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I would think that's a bit of a silly question in the sense that it would be great. It would be wonderful. I'm trying not to get too far ahead of myself, although it's hard not to do as the leader.   
 I'm excited Rock will wear that yellow jersey, and hopefully it'll work better tomorrow than it did yesterday.  
  
  Q. I'll try a more sensible question. How does this week prepare - I mean, obviously this week is such a different course - you know, for next week?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: It doesn't really prepare you for next week.   
  
  Q. Is it almost a disadvantage playing this week?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: There's not a disadvantage. You've got to play. This is a big event. You've got to play here.   
 It doesn't necessarily -- I mean, I'm just confident in my golf swing more than anything, how it would prepare me for next week.   
 In terms of conditions, it doesn't do anything to help me for next week.  
  
  Q. Have you played Birkdale before?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: No, I have not.   
  
  Q. Extra length, we talked a little bit about that. Obviously the course has been playing very wet, and you've been attacking the flags today. That's probably helped you, the length you've added.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, it's a little bit of everything. It's a lot of working with Callaway and making sure that I have the best clubs to fit my golf swing.   
 And in changing my golf swing with Adam, it's been a lot of work. It's been two years now. It gets very frustrating at times. But I feel the most confident with my golf swing this week than I have in a very long time. So that's definitely a bonus.  
 You know, I went to a longer driver, a longer Diablo driver, and put new irons in my bag that are going further as well.   
 So it's a bit all around. You know, I'm hitting 15, 20 yards further off the tee and ten yards less into green, so it makes the hole play 20 to 25 yards shorter over the entire hole.   
  
  Q. With the rain, you'll be prepared for Birkdale next week.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, the conditions yesterday were kind of similar in that sense. I don't have if we'll have any thunder. I looked at the long-range forecast, and it actually looks not too bad. It actually almost looks worse here than it does there.   
 But certainly won't take the rain gear out next week.  
  
  Q. You will?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: No, I won't. I won't take it out next week.   
  
  Q. That's good luck?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: No, the rain gear will be in the bag. I won't take it out of the bag. I didn't have it in the bag today, and then there were some dark clouds and I was getting a bit nervous.   
  
  Q. You just said on hole No. 3 you were a little bit -- it was mentally. Can you get over it? Were you nervous?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: It a poor decision off the tee. It's only about 230 to the bunker, and I hit driver trying to keep it left of the bunker and I hit it in the bunker.   
 I never should have risked that. I should've hit 3-wood off the tee. It was playing a little bit more downwind today than it has.  
  
  Q. But you were able to reset and...   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, even from hit ting it in the bunker, I got a little bit unlucky. I had a terrible lie in the bunker and kind of a rake mark and, um, hit a tree. I left my par putt just barely short.  
 But after that, I mean, you know, I felt like I played well. I looked that hole and said, you know, Get over it. It was a poor decision off the tee. It was my own fault. Make birdie.   
 Because you can make birdies on this golf course. Not to say bogeys aren't that big of a deal, but certainly you can rebound from them.  
  
  Q. Comparing yesterday to today, the game was really fast. Do you think it was a big difference? You are fit, bit for those who aren't that fit, does it make a difference?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I mean, it's a tough golf course to walk. We certainly played a bit quicker today. A little bit less time to stop and catch your breath.   
 I can't speak for those who had trouble. I enjoy playing in the twosomes. I like the pace; I like moving; I like not being out on the golf course for five and a half hours.   
 I don't know how long it took us. What, right at about four hours? Not too bad. It just makes it easier. It's more enjoyable.   
 MODERATOR: Thanks, Morgan.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Thanks.
