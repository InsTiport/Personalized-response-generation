  Q. It was probably not the best golf you've all played this week, but after four hard rounds, it was a fantastic win.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: That's pretty much an understatement to say it wasn't very good golf, but neither of us necessarily deserved to win.   
 But we hung tough. We made putts when it counted. Cristie made a lot of good birdie putts kind of in the middle of the round, and I made that really good putt on 17, and we hung in there. We never gave up. Even getting back to all square, we managed to make it work.  
  
  Q. 17, I believe, the Americans have had seven birdies on that hole. They've won it 7 times. What have you done with that hole?   
 CRISTIE KERR: I don't know. Lucky 7, you know. Morgan was kind of mad at herself for missing some of those putts out there, but she made a big one at the right time and we hung tough. People don't realize, you know, we're playing 36 -- we've played 72 holes of golf in the last two days. You're going to see some different kind of golf. You're going to see some great golf, but some missed shots.  
  
  Q. Absolutely, the golf course is long and it's tough, and it's cold and wet, isn't it. Tomorrow's going to be a long day. Are you confident?   
 CRISTIE KERR: You know, we feel good. We've got to go out and take care of our job tomorrow, and let the chips fall where they may.  
  
  Q. On 16, Pettersen rolls in that bomb. What are you thinking going to 17?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Well, I mean, it was an amazing putt. We just tried to stay positive. We tried to stay positive and we felt like we gave a couple holes away on 14 and 15. We should have had them more down.   
 We let the momentum go back in their favor, and we got the momentum right back on 17, and that was a huge putt Morgan made.  
  
  Q. Go ahead.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Personally I could tell that I was getting a little bit angry to the negative effect. And walking down that fairway I took probably just ten really, really deep breaths and said get over it. Nothing matters other than this shot and this putt, and I managed to make birdie.  
  
  Q. Just give me the read on that putt on 17?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Oh, it was maybe two balls outside right. It was just a little bit of a break right to left, which is probably my favorite putt.  
 CRISTIE KERR: It was fast, too. It was fast.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: The same putt I made on the first hole today for par, so I was confident.   
 CRISTIE KERR: Noting that, I'm going to make a note that Morgan started us off in the right direction by making a 12-foot par putt on the first hole. That's huge.   
 You don't want to get down on the first hole, and that kept momentum going with us the whole way.  
  
  Q. A lot has been made about the U.S.'s ability to play strong in singles with potentially 8-8 heading into Sunday. How confident do you guys feel without getting ahead of yourselves?   
 CRISTIE KERR: Well, I think we've just got to be satisfied in the job that we did today in the afternoon coming back the way we did. It's been tough. We knew they were going to be tough. We have to go out there and play our best tomorrow, that's for sure.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, he knew that our point was very important. I knew that we needed to get that point. When I saw that Paula and Brittany had kind of come back and gotten up again, we knew we could come back, and I certainly knew that we could.
