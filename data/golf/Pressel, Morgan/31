 Q.  Red number.  You're in the chase.  MORGAN PRESSEL: Definitely.  I mean under par in an Open is usually going to put you in pretty good position.  Probably will be somewhere in the Top-10 come the end of the day.  But I'm quite a bit behind.  I didn't have my best stuff out there today.  But I'm definitely proud of the way I fought just to get it back into red numbers.   Q.  What gave you the problems today and any idea why that might have happened?  MORGAN PRESSEL: It was a little bit of putting, a little bit of my ball-striking.  I hit some poor shots when I couldn't hit a bad shot, I guess, when it wasn't a good time.  And certainly missed a few par putts, especially early in the round on 4 and 6 and 7.  I could have escaped and gotten away with bad shots if I had made a decent par-putt, so that got me off track early and tried my best to get it back down the back nine.   Q.  Tomorrow is another day.  A lot of things would have to come into play to get you to the top and in contention and maybe take the trophy home.  What's the best case scenario for you?  MORGAN PRESSEL: I'm just going to go out there, I'm 7, 8 behind, however many it will be at the end of the day, go out there and do the same thing that I've been doing.  It's hard to play too aggressive on this golf course because you can get in trouble quickly.  So still going to stick to my game plan and hope I can get a few more putts to fall.
