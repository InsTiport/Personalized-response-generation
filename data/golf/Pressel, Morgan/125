   MORGAN PRESSEL:  I got really unlucky on 16, I ended up in the exact same divot I was in yesterday, the exact same spot, which how often is that going to happen.  But I came back, played well, still had other opportunities and so hopefully I can continue to play well tomorrow. 

 Q.  And you holed out a couple of times coming in? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I had a couple opportunities where I hit the ball tight, and so we'll see. 

 Q.  Should be a good week. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I hope so. 

 Q.  You're still alive and the only one with a chance to win the Grand Slam this year. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  It's still alive. 

 Q.  Can you go over your round a little bit and what you thought was working? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Yeah, I played pretty well.  I didn't play very well on the front nine.  I was hitting this little pull that I haven't hit in a long time and that got me in trouble.  Other than that I hit the ball pretty solidly.  Missed a lot of opportunities and didn't putt as well as I would have liked to. 
 I hit a shot real close on 6 and 18.  They were close. 

 Q.  What are your thoughts going into the weekend? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I'm playing well, so hopefully I can -- I got rid or out of my system what happened on the back nine and play like I played on the front nine the rest of the week.
