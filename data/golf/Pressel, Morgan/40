 Q.   Juli Inkster co‑leading after the second round.   What was it like to play with her today?  
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Oh, it was great.   Juli is a great friend, so it's always fun to play with her, and then of course to watch her play so well.   She's very confident out there.   Definitely probably hit some shots that she wouldn't have liked but recovered nicely from a few of them and made a lot of good putts.  
   
 Q.   Being the Solheim Cup captain this year, I know you guys had a fun dinner on Monday night.   Can you talk about that and what it meant to you?  
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Yeah, it was awesome.   It was one of the coolest evenings really I've ever been a part of.   It was very special.   I mean, two and a half, three hours of listening to stories, first‑hand account stories from President Bush, it was pretty special.   Mrs.Bush is so classy, such a wonderful woman, and the two of them together, to host us in their library was really, really neat and probably something that none of us will ever experience again.  
   
 Q.   There's a lot of American flags on that leaderboard.   Do you think that created a little motivation for you guys?  
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I think it's nice to see, especially there's a lot of points left out there in the remainder of the stretch that we have coming up before Solheim, before the team is announced.   Players are playing well, and that's a good thing.   You want to see the team playing well going into Solheim Cup.   There's definitely a long summer left, but it's nice to see especially our captain up there on top.
