 Q.  Well, done today.  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Thank you.   
 Q.  Minus 1 in probably pretty tricky wind conditions.  Tell us about that?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: Definitely.  Especially -- I mean, there's a lot of conditions out there.  You've got the heat, you've got the wind, not to mention U.S. Open conditions as the course is set up.   
So it was -- the greens, I think, got a little bit crusty, just as expected, throughout the day.  Tough to judge how much the second shots, approach shots, would release.  And I think I did that fairly well most of the day.  I hit a good amount of greens, made a couple of poor swings on the back nine.  But for the most part, was definitely happy with the way that I played today.  Nice to cap it off with a birdie on the last.   
 Q.  And the fact that you played in probably a little bit tougher conditions, and tomorrow morning you're back out again, and get some more back probably, right?  
MORGAN PRESSEL: I haven't looked at the leaderboard, but it definitely looks like the scores this morning were a good bit lower than they were this afternoon as a whole.  I would expect the greens to have a little bit more water on them and maybe be a little bit more approachable.   
Still, I think it will be a challenge, and I'm not sure what the forecast is supposed to be for the wind, but that could play a factor as well.
