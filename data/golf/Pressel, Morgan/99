   MIKE SCANLAN: Birdie 1.  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I hit an 8-iron to about a foot.   
 4, pitching wedge to 15 feet.   
 6, 8-iron to about a foot.   
 9, I 3-putted from about 20 feet, a little over 20 feet, stupid second putt.   
 10, I missed the green right with my 7-wood and just had a horrible lie and 2-putted from like 50 feet.   
 11, I hit-hybrid to about eight feet maybe.   
 17, I hit a 7-wood about a foot.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Morgan, thanks for coming in. A great day, I know as just said on TV, you left a couple out there and I know you're a little frustrated but you have to be happy that you're back in contention and tied for the lead right now. If you would just talk about your day.  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: It's hard to walk off the last hole like that (chuckling).  
 I played the most solid round of golf I played all week in terms of ball-striking. I think I calculated, I missed two greens and I hit it much closer. Granted the wind was down a little bit early, but it was still windy. It's just was not quite as bad as it has been the last couple of days. I just made a couple more putts. I hit some close and I gave myself plenty of opportunities. When you give yourself extra opportunities, you hopefully make more putts.   
  
  Q. If the wind is up tomorrow, how interesting of a day is it going to be with this really crowded leaderboard?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Oh, it's going to be a grind. I think if the wind it up I think you'll see players going backwards. Just like at the U.S. Open on Sunday, those are kind of the tough conditions that the wind out here can bring out.   
 So like the first day, when I shot even par, I was pretty happy with that just because the wind was blowing so hard, so scores like that might not be too bad depending on the wind tomorrow. I'll be in there, I don't know whether I'll be at the end or close to the end.   
 I'll have an idea of what I need to do.   
  
  Q. On 18, how long --  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Do we have to bring that up? (Laughter).  
  
  Q. How long was that putt?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: About two feet.  
  
  Q. Did you just rush it? It looked like you were cruising along.   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: No, I just missed it. Nothing else to say about that.   
  
  Q. How good of a lead player are you?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: We'll see. I haven't had the lead all too often out here. I don't know, I probably won't have the lead by the end of the day with holes like 15 and 18 at the end. But I had the lead at the U.S. Open in 2005, tied on the last day, and I played pretty well.   
 So I mean, hopefully I can hang in there tomorrow. My goal is going to be to go out there and make birdies, as many birdies as I can, and post them early.   
  
  Q. How much does your familiarity with the course, how much is that going to help you tomorrow? Is it going to help you with your confidence, and how much overall do you think it's going to help?  
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I do feel comfortable with the golf course, especially with the way that I've played with week and I've felt comfortable with my swing. It's a good combining. Hopefully come out tomorrow and I can fire like I fired at them today. I felt like I was able to let go a little bit more today than I have in the past month. So hopefully I can continue that on tomorrow and you know, knowing the golf course, it's just an added bonus.   
  
  Q. And why were you able to let go today?   
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I've just been working on my swing quite a bit, working on some swing changes, and today, it just clicked a little better than it has been and sometimes that happens. I like it.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Morgan, thanks so much.
