 Q.  Talk about the last 24 hours and how much you think this might impact your week. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Oh, it's been a bit hectic.  I don't really know how it's going to impact my week.  I guess I kind of look at it as the reason we went, to represent the Tour, and we come here and hopefully get through the first two days and then of course we're rested enough for the weekend. 

 Q.  Do you think it helps the fact that you have played at this course a lot to kind of mitigate the fact that you won't get a practice round? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  Oh, absolutely.  I'm going to go out and try and play a few holes here now. 
 I mean, what can you do?  There's not much you can do.  Luckily I have played this course plenty of times. 

 Q.  Does it change your expectations at all this week? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  No, actually I played really well the last couple days, and I've played well in Vegas.  So I'm hoping to bring that here with me. 

 Q.  Knowing the course, what do you just really need to do here, the speed of the greens, the pins?  What is the most important thing? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL:  I'm just going to go out and try and catch the speed of the greens, see if they've gotten a lot faster in the last couple weeks since I've been here.  I think that's the biggest thing.  I know where to hit the ball off the tee, I know the way the greens roll and things like that, most of it.
