   THE MODERATOR: We're here with Morgan Pressel. Morgan, thanks for coming in. Good round today. You're in contention to win your second Kraft Nabisco Championship. Can you tell me about your round and how you feel going into tomorrow? 
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah. I feel good. I feel like I've played relatively solid the last couple days, but more than anything, I haven't gotten too upset over bad shots and have recovered very well. 
 In a major that's really what it comes down to. It comes down to making the five-footers, which I've done very well, and just realizing that other people are out there making bogeys, too. 
 THE MODERATOR: Questions? 

 Q. Morgan, I know it's been four years, but is there anything you can tap into from 2007, especially with the similarities? It was hot then. You start the final round four back, like you did then. Can you tap into the memories of how you played that final round and can that in any way help you tomorrow?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I just remember that I played very solid. I didn't have any bogeys. I think the course might have even played a little bit more difficult than it is right now. The scores were much higher that year. 
 And you know, a round with no bogeys and a few birdies tomorrow won't hurt me. I might need a few more than three, but you never know. And like what happened with Suzann, you never really know what happens, but I'm going to go out and try not to have that be an option, go out and take it myself. 

 Q. Yani is playing so well, she's No. 1 in the world. It seems like every shot is right on the hole. Do you feel like -- how do you go into tomorrow not thinking about making seven birdies to have a chance?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, I do think that I have to make seven birdies to have a chance, and if I go in, you know, thinking that way and I make five, well, you know, five's not too bad. 

 Q. How good is she playing? Have you watched her at all this week?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I have not watched her, but I mean judging by her scores, I think she's playing pretty well.

 Q. Are you glad you aren't playing with her maybe where you don't have to watch every shot go into the hole?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I don't think it matters one way or the other. 

 Q. You're going to be playing with Michelle tomorrow. How does that stack up for you, Morgan?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Oh, I didn't notice that. I realize. It'll be fun. We get along very well, and it's been a long time since we've played together. So we'll have a good gallery, for sure.

 Q. Yeah, for sure, between the two of you, you will pull them in. On your putting have you been doing a lot of work with Dustin. Has that sort of made some of the putts go better for you this week because a lot of people have had a lot of problems with the greens.
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, for sure. I putted very poorly last week, and we did a lot of work just so that I would feel more comfortable over the ball and get the golf ball started on the line that I want. 
 And it also goes hand in hand with the fact that I have good memories here. I feel like I know the greens fairly well, and there's a lot of putts that I stand over that I know exactly how they're going to break.

 Q. And lastly, have you planned your jump for tomorrow into Poppy's Pond?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: We can't plan that yet, but I won't be wearing white.

 Q. Have you got some ideas?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: No. It'll be spontaneous. 

 Q. Back to the pairing with Michelle, can you talk a little bit about how your games are different, different ways you play the course and how it sets up for you?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, I feel like I've spent, what, this is my sixth Kraft, maybe my seventh. I've spent a lot of time devising my own game plan, so I'm going to stick to that. 
 I don't obviously hit the ball as far as she does or as high and as soft, but I probably hit a few more fairways, so it's a toss-up.

 Q. Morgan, I know you practiced in a lot of heat in Florida, heat here. How has that helped you this week so far?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Usually when it's this hot at home, I practice for about an hour and I go in. It's too hot for me. When you're out here, you gotta actually tough it out and hang out there. 
 But I did grow up in Florida. I certainly have practiced in my fair share of heat. You know, I didn't realize that it was that bad yesterday. It gets much stickier in Florida. This dry heat isn't that terrible.

 Q. All right, Morgan. Have you done any change-up with your wedges for this week because the greens being so firm, et cetera, after last week?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: No. My wedges are the same as they've always been. 

 Q. You've been in the hunt in a number of major championships. What do you most take out of that that will help tomorrow?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, just that usually when it comes down to a Sunday of a major championship, it's the grinders that pull it out, and you know, the ones who really hit the most fairways and greens. 
 You obviously gotta make a lot of putts, but as long as you really don't get too upset with yourself and stay in there and keep grinding. 
 I mean every hole out here is a birdie hole. If you put it in the right spot, you can certainly make birdies, but if you're in the wrong spot, it can go downhill quickly. So I think if you approach every hole as let's birdie this hole and see what happens. 
 THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? Thank you, Morgan.
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Thanks.
