  MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, I played all right on the front nine and I didn't make the silly mistakes like I did yesterday. The back nine is a little bit more scorable and I made some birdies.  
 I've been working trying to figure something out in my golf swing this week. I think yesterday afternoon, I figured something out that at least helped me hit it a little better today. And I hit 14 greens today, so that was definitely an improvement.
