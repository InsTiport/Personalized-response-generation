Q. Happy to finish with the eagle?MORGAN PRESSEL: Definitely happy.  When I got to the 18th tee and I saw that the tee was moved up a little bit, plus it was downwind, I said to my caddie, I said definitely we can get there today if we hit a good drive and I did. I don't think that I hit the ball as well today.  I'm going to definitely go out and hit some golf balls.  I wasn't real happy, kind of limped in a little bit coming down the stretch -- actually the whole day. But again, I missed some putts where I had opportunities for birdies.  It was a little bit of hamming-and-egging it.  When I hit a poor drive I was able to get up-and-down.  And when I hit a good approach in, I didn't make as many birdie putts as could I have.  There's definitely some stuff to work on and I'm excited for Sunday of a major championship tomorrow.Q. Even though you stitched it together, you're still three or four strokes off the lead, how do you feel going into Sunday without being that close?MORGAN PRESSEL: Well, the back nine was huge.  I was not really in the tournament when I made the turn, and missed a short putt for birdie on 9.  So I was a little frustrated about that.  But then to shoot 32 coming in on the back put me right back in the tournament and I have a chance tomorrow, who knows where everybody will finish this afternoon, but I still have a chance.
