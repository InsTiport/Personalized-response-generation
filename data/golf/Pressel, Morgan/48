  MODERATOR:   Happy to be joined in the media center by Morgan Pressel who sits at 8‑under par after three rounds here.
Morgan, what's been working for you this week? 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   I think I've played pretty solidly.   Today was probably one of my sloppier rounds, but I made a couple really good par putts and that kept me in the tournament and in the round.
Finished strong with a birdie on 18 to keep myself in it going into tomorrow. 
MODERATOR:   How important was that birdie on 18 for you?
MORGAN PRESSEL:   It was definitely really important.   I had had a lot of pars in a row.   Was giving myself birdie opportunities but was burning edges.   I left one short in the heart from like eight feet that killed me. 
But then having not made birdie on 17 was hard, so then to come back, and on 18 it was such a tough pin.
I wasn't quite aiming at the pin, but gave myself a little bit of extra room and ended up with a pretty easy putt for birdie.
MODERATOR:   Questions.

Q.   What was the club and distance on 18?
MORGAN PRESSEL:   160 with a 7‑iron.   I think the wind today was a little bit more difficult and that's why I think everybody kind of backed off a lot more shots.
Instead of being into or down, it was cross.   It was is it cross hurting?   Is it cross helping?   It was going back and forth all day today. 
It was more out of east today than out of the northeast, and I think that made the course play a little bit more difficult especially because it was almost straight across on a lot of holes.
When you're in between holes, you know, do you take one more and hit a little control shot or do you go head and swing at it and let the wind take it? 
There was definitely a lot to think about on the golf course today.   I think even more so than the other days.

Q.   I was going to ask you about that.   Can you just tell us about being in this position, how much you're enjoying it, and do you allow yourself to think about what it would mean?
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Well, definitely.   I didn't hit a very good tee shot on the first hole today.   I think the‑‑ I don't want to say the old me, but maybe five years ago I would've gotten really annoyed with myself and not been able to rebound like I did.
I stayed patient and nearly made birdie on 2 and then got it back to even par on 3.   It's nice to be playing well.   I feel good about my game.   Feel good about the way that I'm controlling the golf ball. 
I have some things I need to work on this afternoon and get out there tomorrow.   I felt comfortable today in the final group, which I haven't‑‑ I mean, I was in the final group in Japan, but before then it had been quite a long time.
It was a different position for me, and I think I just enjoyed it and felt comfortable out there.   My playing partners were great today and we had a nice time.

Q.   Before Japan was it Rochester last year?
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Probably.   I'm not positive, but...

Q.   As much as you would badly love to win tomorrow and will be trying as hard as you can, is there any part of you that cares who wins the $1 million?   And when you look at the leaderboard‑‑ can you help me with this at all?
MORGAN PRESSEL:   No.   And to be honest, just because I‑‑ I mean, I'm not in it so I don't know.   I can't follow it.   Like I'm not watching on TV to see who has this many points.   I don't know. 
I'm not following it in my head on the golf course because I don't know how many points people win because I'm not involved, so I haven't looked.   (Laughter.)
Somebody is going to win $1 million tomorrow and it's not going to be me.   That's okay.   I have other things that I can win. 

Q.   You'll take 500,000. 
MORGAN PRESSEL:   Yeah, I'll take that.
