 Q. 32 holes today, I believe, for you. 
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Something like that.

 Q. Can you talk about the challenge of concentrating for that long on this hard of a golf course?
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, I mean, it's tough. You know, the weather, it's a little warm out there. It's a tough walk to begin with, so physically it's difficult. 
 To have to just focus on every single shot for -- I mean, I got here at 6:00 this morning. I've been here a long time, so it's not easy.

 Q. Everybody says, yeah, really tough course, but we're glad to be here and glad for the challenge.
 MORGAN PRESSEL: You know, I think it is, it's a really tough golf course. But if you hit the ball in the right place and, you know, you make a few putts, it's not -- it's not unplayable. 
 You know, I look back and I look at how I've played so far, and mistakes I've made have either been mental or poor decisions or just missed a few putts. 
 I mean, that's really -- but it's not like --

 Q. It's not like easy golf out there.
 MORGAN PRESSEL: Exactly. I mean, you could say the first hole out there is a little goofy, but I played that even par. So I don't know what to say. 
 Yeah, I mean, 1 and 10 are pretty silly, but other than that it's a fairly playable golf course. Not a lot of birdie opportunities, but, you know, it's an Open. You're always playing for par.

 Q. You can go home. Don't have to worry about coming back and playing a hole tomorrow.
 MORGAN PRESSEL: I'm very thankful that I'm finished and don't have to get up tomorrow morning.
