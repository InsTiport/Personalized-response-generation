Q. Pulse was racing with that front nine score.
MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, I got off to a good start. Birdied the first five holes. At some point you're like, Well, you can't birdie them all if you don't birdie the first five, right?
And then actually the putt I missed on 6 was about five feet. So could have birdied the whole front nine for sure. Got a little lucky on 2 and 3 because I chipped in, so it's a tossup I guess.
Q. The more you play the luckier you get.
MORGAN PRESSEL: Exactly. But I knew I had to go out and make some birdies today, and definitely got off to a hot start. Made a few poor swings on the back nine and kind of faltered a little bit, but made a good birdie on 17 and put up a good Sunday score.
Q. It's great you have to you on the Asian Swing. You played all the events. Proud of how you performed?
MORGAN PRESSEL: For the most part. Playing in Korea was a little rough for me personally. I really haven't had my A game for the whole trip, but proud of the way I've grinded it out the last two weeks. I don't know if it'll be a top 10 this week, close to top 10 last week, so definitely proud of the way that we fought out there.
Q. Yeah. And then the fantastic finish at the British Open finished where you finished in fourth place, and part of the Solheim Cup team. 2019 has been a good season. This week in Japan, it's very different out here. Talk me through the experience of the first tee.
MORGAN PRESSEL: Oh, it's unlike anything really that we have on tour. Maybe Solheim Cup, but that's totally a different animal.
It's been a few years since I've played here in Japan, and I forgot how much I missed it. I forgot how wonderful the fans are. I got off to a really slow start the first day and they cheered me on the whole way.
Walking on that first tee, there is nowhere we really get a standing ovation like that, so it's pretty neat. It's really special to play here. They love golf. They love women's golf, and I can't wait to come back next year.
Q. I bet, because you've won in Japan before. A few years ago now, but you are a winner on the Japan tour.
MORGAN PRESSEL: Yeah, and I thought about that out there. I was like, Ah, I would love to get a second win in Japan out there today, but, you know, not meant to be this week. I'll come back and give it my best shot again.
Q. Looking forward to seeing lots of you in a couple of weeks' time at the CME Group Tour Championship.
MORGAN PRESSEL: Yes, week off, head back to the States, and get ready for the season finale.
Q. Everybody loves you here.
MORGAN PRESSEL: I love being here, so it's mutual. I would say I felt it all week, definitely, the support. I know that especially early in my career I played a lot in Japan and I've missed coming. I haven't qualified for this event the last few years.
I mean, I remember when I won at Solanpas Cup. I don't even know what year that was, but the crowds have always been spectacular every time we've played here and supportive of everyone, but certainly especially supportive of me, and I appreciate that.
