JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  We would like to thank Jeff Julian and his wife Kimberly for spending a few minutes with us here in the interview room. 
Jeff is here on a sponsor's exemption and has played  -- this is your fourth, fifth event?  Fifth event this year.  I think probably the best way to start out is for you all just to ask a couple questions and then Kimberly and Jeff will help you out.  Shoot. 
Q.  Jeff, can you talk about your path to the Tour this year?  I know -- most of us know the story.  But what got you this far?
JEFF JULIAN:  Just being here is an accomplishment in itself.  And I think that Kimberly could say it better.  But I believe that when I got an exemption, that's all I hoped for.  And to be here is beyond my expectations.  It's so hard to believe. 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  Kind and generous people, basically is how we're doing it.
JEFF JULIAN:  That's really what's happened.  It started with one event, one cancelled.  And it's been a chain reaction.  And we received so much kindness and generosity.  It's really great.  It's been a great experience.  It's amazing. 

Q.  How is your game?
JEFF JULIAN:  Last week at the local qualifier for the 
US Open  -- I went through that in St. Louis.  I shot 70.  And I needed that for myself and my own game to build confidence, because I've only played Tour events and it's tough enough to play good out here anyway.  But then with the exemptions and going on like that, I was pushing myself as to whether, if my game is still there.  I feel it is.  But I haven't played any rounds in tournament play -- but it proved it to me.  And at the Open Qualifier I birdied 15, 16 and 17 when I needed it.  And I made it through.  So it was a huge boost to my confidence to actually have earned it.
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  And played well.  Plus I think it's hard to tell out here.  Is it the pressure, is it all the press and all the excitement that's creating a little more tension in him?  And that's creating his game to not be where he wants it to be.  And we haven't made a cut yet.  That kind of thing.  So I think the other day, it was good.  Is that what you were trying to say?  That it was nice to actually  --
JEFF JULIAN:  Yeah.  Yeah.
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  To make it through that first stage.

Q.  Where was that?
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  At St. Louis.

Q.   What course?  
JEFF JULIAN: Norwood Hills. 

Q.  Where are you going to play the sectional? 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  Boone Valley.

Q.  Where is that? 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  In St. Louis.

Q.  Boone Valley? 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  Um-hum. 

Q.  That's two weeks?
JEFF JULIAN: June 4th. 

Q.  What are your expectations coming into this tournament and how special is it to be Jack's tournament?
JEFF JULIAN: I have to pinch myself.  I can't believe I'm here.  And I feel good after the last two weeks after the Open Qualifier.  So I feel -- it's hard for me so far this year.  And I haven't played it yet.  We just got here.  But you could eat dinner off the fairways.  And I'm looking forward to just the whole experience.  And just to be here with Jack and Gary.  This morning I looked in my locker and I had a note in my locker from Gary to play a practice round.  But I didn't get here in time.  Hopefully we will have a chance to tee it up.  So it's really a dream come true, it's quite an honor to be here.  It's nice. 

Q.  Will you play a practice round with Jack?  Did he ask you to? 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  That's what he just said.  I think this morning we arrived to register, we got in late last night, we were planning on being here yesterday and couldn't make it.  So we got here at about 10:30 and there was a note in his locker from Gary saying that they were teeing off at I think 9:30 or something.  So missed out playing with him today, but hopefully he'll get to tomorrow or another day. 

Q.  At this point you're playing on sponsor's exemptions  pretty much?
JEFF JULIAN:  Yes.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  And you've used how many?
JEFF JULIAN:  Five.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  So you got --
JEFF JULIAN:  I have two more Kemper and Hartford.
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  Then we're done. 

Q.  I came in a little late.  You missed Gary and Jack, but did you get, did you play today?
JEFF JULIAN:  Not yet.

Q.  You did play?
JEFF JULIAN:  No.  Not yet.  I'm going to head out as soon as we're done and tee off. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Everybody all set? 
Q.  Kimberly, what is your role in traveling with Jeff and what's your role in helping him out and being by his side? 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  His right hand, I guess.  I don't know.  Really just to be there and be supportive of him.  If I weren't traveling with him, I couldn't not come. 
JEFF JULIAN:  We have a tough time being apart.
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  We're attached at the hip. 
JEFF JULIAN:  She keeps me on my regimen.  We have to do a lot of medications and this and that.  And then there's sleeping and eating and everything.  She's there and makes me keep up with everything that I'm supposed to.  It is difficult to travel and do all that.  So she's a mom, a wife and a nurse and everything else. 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  That's why I'm not caddieing this year, I can't do everything.

Q.  You did caddy before? 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  Last year, yes.  I enjoyed it too.  I had fun. 

Q.  Scratch player? 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  No. 
JEFF JULIAN:  She's good. 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  He thinks I'm good.  I don't. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  All right.  Thanks for joining us. 
KIMBERLY JULIAN:  Thank you.
JEFF JULIAN:  Thank you.
