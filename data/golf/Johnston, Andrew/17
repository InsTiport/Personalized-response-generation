Q. 67 today, to go through blemish-free on a cold, tough day, how does that feel?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Really good. I played lovely out there, so I was very happen.
Q. Two in particular highlights, if I can, because the birdie is impressive but for me watching that round today, some really impressive recovery shots.  This one at 7, how difficult was this?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, well, it was funny, because all Gordon said on the tee was, "You cannot go left, you cannot go left."  And I just went and hit it so far left off the tee.  So I kind of looked at it and had a good lie and I got comfortable and I thought, just hit it to ten foot if you can and try to make the putt and I did that, so I was very happy.
Q. And this one at 14, there was a bit of muscle, a bit of beef behind this, a little wasn't there.
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah -- cheesy.
It was a very strange lie.  I had a lot of grass behind it the ball from the edge of the bunker and I just tried to get a steep one and just literally tried to chop it out like I did and worked out pretty good there.
Q. Switching back to Tuesday night, you were part of the Hero Challenge under the floodlights, an event made for you, if you like, wasn't it.  How much did you enjoy it?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, you know, I thought it was a great idea.  I think it was great fun.  I want to do another one.  I want to have another go.  Yeah, that was good.
