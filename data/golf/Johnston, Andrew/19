Q. I tell you what, looking at the first few holes, you doubled 1, you bogeyed 2, you bogeyed 4, you were well back, you were way back, and you came back.  What changed there late in the round?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Nothing, just a good attitude.  I just tried to stay calm.  It's been a busy few weeks and I knew I was quite tired this morning, so I said just don't be hard on myself, just keep playing and just enjoy it, talk to the guys, and if I pick up any shots coming in, happy days and go again tomorrow.
Q. Tell us a little bit about, you said it's been busy, the fun you had recently, filming some of the commercials, some of those will air on NBC here during the TOUR Championship and I've seen them and they're pretty fun.
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, it's good.  I did a couple days filming back home with Arby's and then I had great fun doing it here.
Q. So what are your plans now?  It's been a long stretch for you, what happens after this week?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I head back for a week off and then play Dunhill, British Masters, week off, and then HSBC, then Turkey, and South Africa and then Dubai.  So, yeah, busy stretch.
Q. That is a busy stretch.  You are a professional golfer congratulations on your comeback today.  That was great.
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Cheers.
