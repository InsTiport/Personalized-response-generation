Q. A low 66 in windy conditions.
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Very happy with the score today.  Pleased the way I controlled the ball flight and putted well, so it was good.
Q. Obviously you play well in windy conditions; is it something you just relish, you're good at?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, exactly what I thought when I turned up.  Just turn up and play and control the ball flight and then putt well.
Q. You certainly know that you have to play well, the reputation for Qatar down the years is it's going to get windy, so how challenging was it out there?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: It's tricky.  You've got quite a few crosswinds, so you want to be starting the ball wide enough and not losing them on the wind and stuff like that and controlling the distance coming into some of the greens.
And then putting can be difficult.  They are more grainy than last week and especially with the winds, if you've got putts coming across, difficult into the grain and then back down with the wind, it can get tricky.
Q. And I guess that's almost a surprise, as well, isn't it, when you go from one desert course to another, you kind of expect a uniformity, but when you find the grain is different --
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, this one is completely different here.  I would say last week, next week are quite similar and this week is totally different.
Q. How's your winter?  Did you winter well?  Did you fully prepare for 2016?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Had a great break in December.  Down and watched Arsenal quite a lot.  I watched the darts, PDC, spent time with my mates and family.  Good rest.
Q. Were you watching the final, getting involved?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, I was just watching it on telly.  I never went down there.  Just watched it on telly.  Watched it with friends and I know all my mates now have bought dart boards, so I need to get one.  I haven't had time yet.
