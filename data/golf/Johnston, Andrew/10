ANDREW JOHNSTON: That was it, really.  Such fine margins, very close, yeah, just not quite there.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I got in after my round yesterday and then showed a poll saying, am I an inspiration or a clown?  And I kind of went off a little bit.  It annoyed me.  And I had a few people message me and said, "Maybe you should listen to the show."  And it was actually worse listening to it.  I don't mind being criticized.  I think it's good taking people's opinions, to see what I can do better, you know, and if they put a poll out saying, maybe I spend too much time with the fans or I don't concentrate, would he play better, this and that, I'd understand that, I'd totally get that.  But when he's taking piss out of my face, my teeth, and stuff like that, I think it's bang out of order.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, not really.  I had a really good warmup on the range.  And I felt really good going into it.  So I was disappointed the way I hit it for the first few holes, because I had a really good feeling on the range.  It had nothing to do with it.  It's like out my head.  I just find, yeah, I just find it bad.  Like you can criticize, but don't take the piss.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, that was a lovely comment, Thomas Bjorn made a lovely comment, Darren Barker did.  There were loads of people that did, and I can't thank them enough.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, hundred percent, the fans have been great.  Everywhere I go the fans have been brilliant and I absolutely love it.  I've never dreamt of being able to walk down 18 on a Sunday Open.  It means the world to me.  It's the best thing.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, you've got to stand up.  Would you take it if someone said, your beard looks ... and you've got  .... up teeth, would you take that?  Exactly.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah.  Capitalize on it, but I stand up for myself, what I said that's it.  It's done now.  They won't hear another word out of me from it.  That's it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I've got to wait to see if I get in first.  I think I will.  I was 112th coming into this week.  I don't know what I'll be after this week.  Hopefully I'll get in.  It's a great event.  I had a great time last year, you want to be playing against these guys, who are the best in the world.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: That's the exact word.  It's close, man.  I've grinded so hard these four weeks trying to find something, just find an edge, and I just haven't found it.  But I've been really proud the way I've battled the last four weeks and battled this week.  Yeah, it just hasn't been there.  But I know it's not far, and you've just got to stay positive.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, I mean it's amazing.  Coming in I was excited to see what kind of response.  But when I'm actually here it just amazes me every time.  The people are just great.
