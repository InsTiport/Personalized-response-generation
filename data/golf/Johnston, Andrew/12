Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, I've been looking forward to this week since Sunday at Troon, since I finished.  And it's such a great event.  But going in, I know it's a new year, it's a different golf course, and I didn't really want to read too much into last year coming into this week.  It's a different tournament.  And that's how I've kind of seen it.  But it's nice to get off to a good start.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: It's just because it's a different -- yeah, it's a different course.  Weather was pretty similar today.  It was a bit grim early on.  But I just wanted to go out there and not think about it.  Because I think you can go in and say, it's going to be exactly the same as last year, and that's the one thing I didn't want to fall into.  I wanted to say, it's another tournament, I'm going to prepare well and go and give it the best, and that's the kind of way I've taken to it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, it was tricky.  I just really didn't strike the ball that good early on.  And to sort of -- yeah, I knocked that in.  If you don't get up and down there, you go to 3-over.  If I go to 3-over instead of going back to 1-over, which is a big difference, you know.  And I knew we had the two par-5s coming in.  I was just sort of, come on, try and get something going.  Try and hit some greens.  I didn't hit many hit greens in the first sort of 11, 12 holes.  I only hit four or five greens.  And I knew I was putting well.  Come on, you've got to try to hit some fairways, give yourself chances and luckily I did that.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I would give it about a six or seven.  Yeah, I don't feel I've played great.  I played well in Switzerland, and then I struggled coming in the end of the season, then I didn't play well.  I haven't played well early on in the States this year.  And then the last month or so, six weeks I've started to play nice.  I played nice in Wentworth, nice in France, nice last week and that.  So hopefully I've been grinding away really hard, trying to get something going.
Yeah, so hopefully I can hopefully turn a corner this last month, and start to put some scores on the board.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, I think now I've learned a hell of a lot the last year and how to deal with it.  I think I'm getting better at that and managing my time better.  I'm still giving enough time to everybody, which I want to do.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I can't do it.  Honestly, if I stay that focused for five hours, I'll have a headache after nine holes, seriously.  And I just like to go out and hit my shot, you know.  Go out and switch on, hit my shot and once we have time, we have four or five minutes, and walk down to the ball and stuff like that.  So I just like to relax.  And if people shout, I'm going to wave at them and have a good time along the way.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, I didn't know it was coming until I got on the tee.  And I shook hands with everyone and said, "I am going to call you 'Beef' today."  Yeah, he said, "I am going to call you 'Beef'."  And that was pretty cool.  That was pretty cool.  I better hit a good tee shot now.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, that would be cool, yeah.  Because I'm known, all my friends call me that.  So I have no problem if they want to do it and get the crowd doing it, I'm not going to fuss one bit.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: There's eight people here for Arby's.  We did the thing called the Golden Ticket.  We handed out four tickets, and they could bring a friend as well or partner, whoever they wanted to bring.  And we went for dinner last night in Liverpool.  So, yeah, it's been good.  And hopefully they've had a good day, too.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: It was cool.  It was just nice meeting everyone.  We had a few people from Arby's that I know.  My manager there.  And it was good.  It was good to sort of chat with everyone, and it's kind of relaxing in a way.  You could be sitting in your hotel room going over the yardage book the day before, and looking at this and where the pin is going to be and stuff, but I was just nice and relaxed to come into it today, and that's what I like, to switch off completely.  Once I leave the golf course, I'm not going to think about it at all.  I'm just going to go and relax and come back tomorrow and have another go at it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I'm not sure yet.  I'll make a decision soon.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, it's not.  Check this out, look at that.  It's coming out the sides of my head.  No, they should have given me a haircut, that would have been nice.  I would probably have said, yeah, if they said, "Can we stream your hair and beard?"  I would have said, yeah.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, no, I don't want to get rid of it but I need a haircut really bad and I need to get my beard trimmed a little bit.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, no, I don't know what it is.  I don't know what happens.  Honestly I couldn't tell you.
