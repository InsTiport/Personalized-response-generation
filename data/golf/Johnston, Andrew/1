 Q.  How pleased are you with your week's work here in Italy?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, very happy. I thought I just stuck at it really well all week. Golf is a strange game. You can think, I'm playing so good and you end up 40th or missed the cut, something like that, and it felt quite scrappy at times all week. I just seemed to keep the ball in play, keep scoring, hitting a good shot at the right time, and just keep ticking along. So it's been a really good week.   
 Q.  Some of your best finishes have been in the Rolex Series Events. Why do you think that might be?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: It's just timing, isn't it, sometimes. I think the year before, I didn't do too good in them. It's just the timing when you're going to play well and when you're not. Fortunately I've just timed it well this year.   
 Q.  A lot of Race to Dubai ranking points, World Ranking points, Ryder Cup points this week; a lot to build on from here?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, definitely. I've just got to keep sticking to what I'm doing. I know I'm working on the right things. My game is trending in the right direction, so I've just got to keep doing it.   
 Q.  And finally, wherever you go, the shouts of Beef ring out, but they were especially loud on the 18th. How have you enjoyed your reception here in Italy?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, it's amazing. I mean, the love I get everywhere is just unbelievable, and here, too. It was great playing with Andrea, as well today, and the shot he holed on 4 was just incredible. As I look back, it's such a nice moment to be part of that as well with the home crowd, but yeah, the crowds have been fantastic here and look forward to coming back here.
