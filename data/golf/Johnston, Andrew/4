 Q.  How was it out there?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, it was all right.  I didn't quite strike the ball as well as I wanted to.  So, yeah, it was a bit tough.  Obviously starting off holing a stupid putt on the second hole.  It was a bit of a struggle all day.  And I just tried to keep ticking along.   
I don't think I've done too much damage today, really.   
 Q.  The first tee, did it give you an idea of how mega the tournament is from the crowds?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Walking on the first tee gave me an idea.  Yeah, all we saw was an amazing reception.  So, yeah, I'd say that was...   
 Q.  How did you find they responded to you?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: The crowd's been great.  Yeah, just amazing, as usual.  And it's always surreal.   
 Q.  It was quite emotional for you out there.  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, definitely.  It was good.  Sunday was one of those days where I feel I really worked hard and tried and worked everything; my mind, game, as well.  And I felt like I've been playing some good golf recently and the scores just didn't come.   
Scotland was a nice relief.  It was more a happy emotion, I guess.   
 Q.  Do you feel the crowds missed you?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I've missed the crowds, for sure.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts on Bob and the way he played?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: He played great.  Yeah, very impressed with his game.  And what a good lad, as well.  We had a nice chat.   
 Q.  What did you talk about?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Just general about back home, and where he's from and where I'm from.  A proper, good lad.   
 Q.  Did you know who he was before?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, not a clue.  I know now.   
 Q.  Did you see a lot of yourself in him?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, in a way.  Yeah, I love the way he just went on with it.  Had a good laugh out there.  Yeah, it was kind of similar.   
 Q.  You're fast walking, as well.  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, it's like he was playing with his mates around the local course and stuff.  Nothing bothered him.  I was very impressed.   
 Q.  Done for the rest of the day, then?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I'm not too sure.  I might go and hit a few because I think that last few holes something was missing in my swing.  I'm going to try to find that.   
I might take my fiancÃ©e to the Causeway, I think.  We'll see how it goes.  Or I could be on the sofa with a cup of tea and pack of biscuits.
