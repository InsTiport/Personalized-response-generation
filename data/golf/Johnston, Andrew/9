Q. Bogey-free today, what most pleased you about your game?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Just the consistency off the tee.  Drove the ball lovely.  Hit a lot of fairways and you can put yourself in good positions to hit a lot of wedges and 9-irons in on the par 4s and stuff, so you can give yourself some chances.  The putter went a bit cold on the back nine, but you just have to stay patient.
Q. We know last year was a bit of a battle for you, trying to balance both tours, as well.  Is there a sense coming in here this week, you're wiping the slate clean and you can go again?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: 100 per cent.  Like I sort of -- when I go home and I finish my season, I look back at it and I was just like, it was so crazy, so many distractions, and I probably drunk too much, as well.  You've gone to too many parties and you get invited here and there and stuff and you're burning the candle at both ends.
I was like, all right, that's it.  Once Christmas, New Year's is done, just get back to basics and take it nice and easy.  I feel great.
Q. What is it going into this year now that you most look forward to?  What's the part of your game you feel needs to elevate to get back to where you were and try to win again on The European Tour?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Just put the work in.  I didn't put enough work in last year, it's simple.  It showed.  So just get down, knuckle down and practise hard.
