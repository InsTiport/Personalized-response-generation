 Q.  If you can just go through your last two days, how has it been?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, it's been good fun, you know, two really good groups, two good fourballs.  It's different, you know, like we never get to play anything like this, so coming here, I always look forward to like meeting new people and meeting other like stars as what they do, so it's cool.   
 Q.  Just looking ahead, your PGA TOUR card now.  Are you looking forward to that challenge?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Pleased Todd I sort of went over and got a card and I think it's going to make for a good year next year.   
 Q.  They certainly enjoy you over there.  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I enjoy it.  They have got some great tournaments, as well, and some great tournaments here.  If I can play all the best tournaments, it's great, man.
