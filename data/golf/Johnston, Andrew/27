Q. Right up there at the halfway stage.
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, it's a good start, and pleased with the two days.
Q. What have you done so well?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Drove the ball well.  Kept it in play.  I've hit a lot of good sort of iron shots right side of the pin, and I've putted well.
Q. We saw you in what looked like an awkward position, right by the wall, deft little chip from there, another birdie on your card?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I was just trying to take a bit off a driver and just pulled it a bit and when I got up there, it was sitting quite nice, and I was chipping back into the wind so I could be aggressive.
Q. It looked like it might be tricky?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, no, it wasn't too bad.  Good stance and good lie.
Q. Are you seeing just plenty of opportunities and chances all around the course, despite the conditions?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I haven't really thought about it that much.  I've just sort of played and sort of taken every hole as it comes.  Holed some good putts at good times for birdies and hit some good shots at other good times.  It's sort of gelled well together.
Q. Is that just the way you play golf?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Pretty much.
Q. Kind of frees you up, really, rather than thinking too much?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Definitely, try not to think out there and just hit shot by shot.
Q. What's that down to?  Is that down to upbringing, because you have coaches telling you do this, do that; you can't have so much in your mind.
ANDREW JOHNSTON: It's kind of how I've always as a kid.  Always just try and keep it that way.
Q. What are your thoughts then into the weekend in this position?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Just keep doing what I'm doing.  Keep trying to keep the ball in play, hit some good shots and hole some putts and do exactly the same.
