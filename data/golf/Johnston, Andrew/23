 Q.  How was the experience?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I tell you today, it was probably slightly disappointing the way I played.  I started off pretty good, but I don't think my short game was good enough today.  I didn't putt that well.  There was a better score to be had, but I gave it my best and that's what I come off with, so no regrets.   
But I've had a fantastic week.  I'm sure I'll look back on this over the next few weeks and gain a lot of experience this week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I've just been told that we've gotten into the tournament in Canada next week, so we've got to make a decision about that first.  But I'll probably wait.  I think hopefully we get into U.S. PGA as well after we get into that.  So we'll wait to see.  Otherwise I'll have to keep my head down for a couple weeks and then do it after.   
 Q.  When you got to 7-under on your round, did you have the belief?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I think you always have to have the belief.  But the golf those two were playing was unreal.  They were playing a different golf course unless they've both moved up here.  It's amazing.  Hat's off to them.  Hat's off to Henrik as well.  Great performance.   
But I had belief, but I knew I was quite far behind.  Then when I looked at the scoreboard on, I don't know if it was 7 or 8, it was like a two-horse race.  No one's going to go really low on that back nine there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Just incredible, man.  Oh, speechless.  And down the 1st shocked me as well when I got to the green and I holed the putt, and it was just absolutely crazy in there.  And coming down to 18, I'll remember it forever.   
 Q.  The interactions with players, the galleries and golf, and now tramping on golf traditions (inaudible)?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, I think so, but everyone's different.  All the players are different.  Some of them like to be quiet on the course.  Some of them like to be a bit different, and that's the first thing I say.  So they've got to do what they're comfortable with first of all.  Then I don't want to break any traditions and stuff like that at all.  I just want to sort of be myself, go out and enjoy it and acknowledge the crowds.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Just crazy, man.  Just the noise, and I thought, oh, it stopped and it carried on.  I thought I better put my putter back in the air.  It was like that.  It was just amazing.   
 Q.  Was there ever a point in the last two days where maybe (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, no, I've been good.  I've been really good at switching on and off.  I have good fun out there.  But there was not one shot I don't think where I wasn't concentrating and it got to me.  I've loved every minute of it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, my mom, sister, my niece, my brother came up as well, so, yeah, it's been good.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, no, I'm going to have to get some good presents.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Oh, man, my shoulder injury, scramping on Challenge Tour to try to keep my card.  Having to play, I played something like 11 and 12 weeks to try and keep it, and I managed just to keep it and things like that.  You've always got to remember where you've come from and where you've been.  I always stay grounded.  I'll always be the same person.  That's the most important thing.   
 Q.  You were saying something before about your father.  How much have you thought about him in the past couple of days?  Would he be proud?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I hope so.  Yeah, I guess so, and that's what you want to do is just make him proud and keep working hard.  But I tried to block that out.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: You know, I never see it like that.  I just see it as we're going to go to the next tournament and prepare well and tee it up again.  I'm still going to be playing golf.  I'm still going to be the same person and that.  So I've never seen it as being life-changing.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: It stays for sure, but it needs a trim.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I watched some yesterday because I wasn't happy the way I hit it off the left-to-right wind coming in.  I chipped and putted well yesterday, but I just wanted to see if I could pick anything up for for today.  But, no, it's been a good achievement.  I want to come back and do better, and there's a few more places to move up, and I want to stay ambitious and keep working hard.   
 Q.  Has it changed your perspective at all?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yes, another really good confidence boost to finish top 10 in majors, it's a good confidence boost in that.  So I'm going to try to use it positively and not sit back on it.  Work hard.  That's what I said in Spain.  There's no point in sitting back and saying, oh, I've done this, I've done that.  Right.  We've got to try this and do this and try to get into this event and do this, you know.  So always looking forward.  Never looking back.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be a role model now, a very different role model (Inaudible)?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, I guess just like a different person, you know.  But there's a lot of good guys out there.  They're good role models and that.  As I said, everyone's different.  People pick up on it how they want to.  Some kids will go, "Oh, I really like him.  I really like him," and stuff like that.  As long as I can sort of affect people in a positive way, you know, "Oh I want to come out and play golf."  I've had so many nice messages on Twitter saying like, "Oh, we loved you."  "My wife's gotten into golf.  My boy's love it," and stuff like that.  I think that's the most important thing.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Just have fun, man.  Just play with your mates, do what you want to do.  You see it at my golf club.  People want to play and practise and get their handicaps down.  Obviously had a hard week at work and they want to go out and have a few beers and stuff on the course.  And I don't think that's a bad thing either.  As long as everyone's kind of playing and having fun in their own way, and I think that's what you've got to do.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: This beard scares them away, man (laughing).   
 Q.  Do you expect to have a celebration tonight and order some pizza or some sort?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I have no idea, man.  Again, it's a team decision, but I'll definitely be having a beer tonight.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, I'm going to get someone else to play.  I want a few beers (laughing).
