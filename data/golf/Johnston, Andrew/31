 Q.   What were your thoughts, emotions, once that ball dropped in the hole?   
ANDREW JOHNSTON:   I ran over to my mate and just pumping.   It was just madness.   Took one bounce and hit the flag and went straight in.   It just happened so quick, so I didn't really know what to do.  
   
 Q.   When you saw your friend, you obviously made quite a beeline for him.   
ANDREW JOHNSTON:   I just saw him.   He looked and I was like, all right, now is the time to go.   It was perfect timing.   
   
 Q.   Did you know at that time that you had got the car?   
ANDREW JOHNSTON:   No, I didn't know if it was all week or on Sunday, so I sort of kept it out of my head when I was playing, so I was waiting to find out when I got in.   
   
 Q.   When you found out, what were your emotions then?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON:   Yeah, I love them cars, and, yeah, I can't wait to give it a go.  
   
 Q.   You've got two holes‑in‑one on The European Tour and you know when to pick your times, a prize each for both times.   
ANDREW JOHNSTON:   I've been really lucky with that and hopefully that can continue.  
   
 Q.   Can you tell us about the first one and going into this one, the difference in the prizes obviously.   
ANDREW JOHNSTON:   The first one was 168 bottles of champagne at The Scottish Open last year and it was kind of freaky because I played with Phil Price and he won it the year before.   So, yeah, that was great fun and then obviously to come here and win a car, it's just nuts.   It's madness.  
   
 Q.   And the other player, Jason, got a hole‑in‑one at the BMW Championship before.   
ANDREW JOHNSTON:   So many freaky things happen.   
   
 Q.   And obviously to do it at a tournament this big, it must feel pretty special with the big crowds?   
ANDREW JOHNSTON:   Yeah, it was great to have a big crowd there and get everyone cheering and excited, that was really good and helped my score, most of it.
