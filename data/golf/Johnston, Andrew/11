ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, tough going.  That wind change definitely makes the course play harder.  We had the same wind in practice and it was tricky.
Yeah, again, just didn't hit the ball well enough.  Hit too many poor shots, and then I battled really well.  And then to make 7 on 17 was quite frustrating.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, I hit a good tee shot and I hit an awful second shot.  I didn't think it would be that bad but it was nestled down.  I tried to get it back out and it didn't come out.  Then another one, just about got over the hill.  And then I hit it in the middle of the green and two putts for 7.  So yeah, it was frustrating.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I'm going to go back and I'm going to rain dance all day now, about five hours straight, yeah (laughing).
No, obviously whatever happens, happens.  It is what it is.  But I don't make the cut, I didn't play well enough.  It's as simple as that.  If it turns a bit harder and I get a bit lucky, then great.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, I did, yeah.  Yeah, both days.  I liked it.  It's got a good ring to it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, first day he said, "I'm gonna manage you as Beef, do you mind?"  And I said, "No, not at all."
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: 13 I hit a decent drive.  It just caught the wind a bit and ended up on the left side in the rough.  And I hit 3-wood in and I had 230 to the pin.  225, 230 to the pin.  It was playing so long it was about 210 to the front.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: 12, the par-3, I hit 4-iron in there.  It was playing about 170 yards, 160 -- yeah, about 160 yards, and it was just pumping in there, absolutely.  It was tricky.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I hit 5-iron, because the wind was actually the same there.  And then yesterday I think I hit a 6-iron yesterday.  But it was just different.  They moved the tee up and they put the pin in the front, so it was playing shorter and I've hit a lot more club.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: The Americans (laughter).  They're not used to this kind of cold.  Where is he from, San Diego?  He's not used to this.
No, it's pretty cold out there.  It's a cold wind, especially if the rain comes in, you get a bit wet and a bit damp.  It makes that wind a lot colder.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: About 10:00.  And then I'll be going to bed now, what's the time now?  What have we got, half of 11.  I'll be going back to bed about 1:00, as well.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I think so, yeah.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Two or three.  I'm going to have a good nap, put the telly on, watch something.
Q. What will you watch?
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I have no idea, I've already caught up on Game of Thrones.  I caught up on that the other day.  I'm not sure what I'm going to catch up on next.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, I'm not.  I'm not too sure.  I'm down to play Canada next week.  And I'm not sure if I'm going to play yet.  I've got to make a decision this afternoon.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, they've been wicked.  Gone out to dinner with them the other night and getting to meet them properly.  They're proper nice people.  And hopefully they're having a really good time and enjoying The Open.  I know a few of them, I said, they had to get passports and stuff like that.  So they've never been outside of America and stuff.  And then we were chatting about the differences and things like that, and I think they were really enjoying it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Definitely at Troon last year.  That weekend, the Saturday, Sunday, and then it just kind of -- it kind of continued from there.  I mean, going and playing in Switzerland I thought that generally is quite -- the people are quite reserved.  And I got on the first tee there and they were all screaming "Beef!"  And I was like this is actually quite crazy over there, and I realized this is mad.  And then go to US-PGA last year after The Open was crazy.  I've never seen anything like it.  And it's just things like that.  And sometimes you look into it and realise someone is following you, like famous.  And I'm just, why are they following me?
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Man, I don't want to name drop.  One of the guys I've gotten really good with is Kunal Nayyar.  He plays Raj on Big Bang Theory.  He was playing at Pebble Beach, and he dropped a message and said, "Are you playing?  We should catch up and have dinner."  Stuff like that, it's just madness.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: No, not him.  I'd like to meet him.  He's amazing.
I've put myself on the spot.  You put me on the spot, but I put myself on the spot.  I mean, like just a few of the footballers.  I've been in touch with Adam Ramsay a bit.  I'm going to miss someone, my brain is frazzled.  I can't think of anyone, man.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, just stuff like that.  I met him at The Grove and had a chat and stuff like that.  And we've been trying to organize a game of golf, things like that, but his schedules clashed and stuff like that.
Yeah, it's just pretty mad.  And playing at Northmead -- well, I ended up going to dinner with him one evening, to dinner and playing in these events and stuff like that is mad, man.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ANDREW JOHNSTON: The craziest?  Oh, man, I think going to (indiscernible).  Then they're giving these wristbands and said "free drink", I think that was the craziest.  Exactly, you can tell why (laughter).
