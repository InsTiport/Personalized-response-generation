 Q.  How do you deal with all the celebrity in your life right now?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I just embrace it.  It means the world to me.  I've never dreamt of having that kind of support, and having that kind of following of fans, I think is so cool.   
 Q.  How about your golf today, what was working for you?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: I just played really solid today.  Didn't really make any mistakes.  Yeah, very happy with the way I've played.  After ten holes yesterday, I was four every after ten holes.  To come back and finish strong yesterday, I just tried to keep that momentum going into today.   
 Q.  You've won on a difficult golf course before at Valderrama and this is another difficult test.  How much does it seem to fit your game?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, it does.  You've got to drive it well.  I think if you put it in play, you can make some birdies out there.  There's some real tough holes.   
 Q.  What do you hope to accomplish in this game?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Win as much as possible and put your name on as many trophies as possible, but I'm going to have fun along the way doing it.   
 Q.  Is it true you went to a bar in New Orleans and had a putting contest with the Faithful?  
ANDREW JOHNSTON: Yeah, we put a pint glass down and I said, anyone hole it, I'll buy the whole bar a round of drinks and two kind of rolled in and back out and I said, that's good enough for me.
