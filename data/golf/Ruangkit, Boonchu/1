 Q.   Talk about your day.   
BOONCHU RUANGKIT:   I hit the ball well, the greens are tough and I had a hard time putting.  
   
 Q.   Talk to me about the greens.   Were there any straight putts?   How did they play?   A lot of tough putts today?  
BOONCHU RUANGKIT:   It was tough because there was a lot of lines and then once you got the line, then you had to fight with the wind.   
   
 Q.   What did you learn from playing in the wind today that will help you going into tomorrow?  
BOONCHU RUANGKIT:   It's all about the ball striking and tomorrow the wind will probably be stronger than today.
