 Q.  Can you talk about finish?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I played solid and gave myself lot of chances.  Started very good.  That driver, I mean, one meter more on the left, and I had a shot to the green.  So I just tried to hit it and then I dropped it and made a 6.  But I think there's lots more positives, I want to focus on that and play tomorrow.   
 Q.  Three rounds in the 60s going into a major Sunday.  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I've been playing good, so I have to keep doing the same.  I like the course.  If I make a few putts, I think I can have a chance tomorrow.   
 Q.  And is there anything you'll go and do now?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I don't think so.  Just rest.  It's pretty late, so just rest, have a good dinner and try to play good tomorrow.   
 Q.  Are you able to forget about it pretty easily?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I think that's what I have to do, because I've been playing very good and hit the ball very good in the last three days, so I don't think I want to focus on that shot that I hit on 18.  There are lots more positives, so try to focus on those ones and try my best tomorrow.   
 Q.  Are you looking at the leaderboard?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: I did at the end on the back nine.  Saw Morgan was playing pretty good.  Happy for her.  Hopefully can be up there and play well tomorrow.   
 Q.  What is it about the course that suits you, because you have played really well for three days.  Do you like the length?  
CARLOTA CIGANDA: Yeah, I like the length.  I like the trees.  I like the design.  I think you have to think.  It's important to have a good strategy, so I like that.  I have a great caddie, so yeah, we can play good here.
