  MARCUS ALLEN: I played my first‑‑ well, I say my first. I played at San Diego Stadium at the halftime of a Charger game. So for me, there's a lot of history. My dad took me to Balboa Stadium. You know, that was downtown San Diego at the time, early, early '60s.   
And then ended up going to a lot of games while the Chargers played in San Diego Stadium. I guess Jack Murphy at one time, and then it went to Qualcomm.  
   
 Q. You said you never thought it could happen. Would you acknowledge that was an emotional thought that you had?   
MARCUS ALLEN: Yeah, I guess. I just didn't think that San Diego would ever lose the Chargers. You know how teams posture and cities posture, but you figure everything will be worked out.   
I always thought it was more of a football town than it was a baseball town, but the fact that they built the stadium downtown, you'd think they would naturally take care of the Chargers after that. And it's not going to happen? That's pretty remarkable.
