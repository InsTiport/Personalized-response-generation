 Q. Did the lack of a sufficient plan, in the NFLs eyes, kill the Raiders chances of moving to Los Angeles?   
MARCUS ALLEN: I really don't know. I knew that it was an incredible fan base there. They certainly will be accepted here. They need a new stadium regardless.  
   
 Q. Should the Raiders stay in Oakland with a fan base that seems to fit that team?  
MARCUS ALLEN: Well, with the existing stadium, they deserve better. I mean, it was built in, what, 1964? And it's a relic compared to the other state of the art facilities.   
And if you want to impose certain standards in the National Football League, you have really 30 teams that have jewels of properties. The majority of the teams have incredible properties and stadiums, and then there's a few‑‑ I don't think the league wants that. I think they want every single team housed in an incredible place.
