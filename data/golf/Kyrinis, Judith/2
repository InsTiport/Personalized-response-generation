Q. (Indiscernible - wind.)
JUDITH KYRINIS: Yeah, you know, she's a very solid player.  She doesn't miss much.  Her putter was on today, which is great.
I had a lot of looks early and I just couldn't get -- see things for them to drop.  Then made a couple -- you know, a little sloppy play on 8 and 9.  The 3-putt on 8, and 9, you know, the chip comes out and then 11 the chip stops.
So it's just the nature of bermuda.  Still learning bermuda.  (Laughter.)
Q. What does it feel like to make the run to defend your title?
JUDITH KYRINIS: You know, I think I did myself proud.  You know, qualified well.  I played really solid.  Today a little bit disappointed, but I'm happy to see her go on.  She's a great player, yeah.
Q. Finally, can you just quickly tell me about your year, about how it felt to be the champion of this event.
JUDITH KYRINIS: Yeah, I've been so proud to call myself a USGA champion.  It's just been a dream come true.  I do still pinch myself, but actually I'm a USGA champion.
They can't take that away from you.  It's a thrill and very proud.  It's been a great year.  I didn't really feel pressure being a USGA champion; I just felt a lot of pride.
