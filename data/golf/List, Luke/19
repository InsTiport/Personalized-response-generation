 Q.  Luke, you put yourself in the perfect position there on the 18th green, a mere 50-foot tap-in.  Great birdie to win the week.  
LUKE LIST: It was hard.  I had kind of a hanging lie.  I couldn't get myself anywhere near the water for that shot to go at the pin.  I was happy with where I left it, and I was kind of telling my caddie the last nine holes I was due for one long putt.  I played really solidly all week.  It was fun to see it go in.   
 Q.  You missed only 7 greens the entire weekend.  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, there's a big improvement from where I started the first two days.  I was really happy with where my ball-striking got, driving in my iron shots.  I was really pleased.   
 Q.  Part of your success 18 of 21 scramble.  
LUKE LIST: I'll take that as well.   
 Q.  You cleaned things up in the final round.  
LUKE LIST: Little rowdy last night.  My wife agreed I needed to tighten it up.
