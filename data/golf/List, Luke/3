 Q.  Just talk about your day, amazing day, the eagle, how did it go out there?  
LUKE LIST: It was a grind, actually.  I didn't really feel great with the biking, so I had to fight that a little bit.  I didn't hit many fairways on the front, or my front, the back nine.  Just kind of pieced it together a little bit.  I was pretty happy with 2-under.  It was gettable today.  Obviously Brooks is up there tearing it up.  I was really hoping to make a few more birdies on the back nine there, and really played down and unfortunate not to.   
 Q.  Your first PGA Championship.  What's it like now going into the third rounds, you're really right in there?  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, you know, obviously we all need help from Brooks.  We have to go out and do some good work on the weekend.  It's going to take something special.   
 Q.  How is the atmosphere out there, all the New Yorkers?  
LUKE LIST: It's hilarious.  I've played some championships up there.  They are characters, for sure.   
 Q.  You had the bogey and the eagle and the birdie.  Did that kind of change momentum?  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, hit a really bad shot on the par 3 there and was one of those lies on the green that you think it's going to come out soft and if it doesn't, you're toast.  Hit a good put.  Just didn't go in.   
The greens got a little bumpy, but they are fantastic out there.  The poa annua greens got a little bumpy in the afternoon.  I was a little disappointed with the three-putt on 8, but it happens.
