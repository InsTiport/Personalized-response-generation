LUKE LIST: Personally, I figured out the driver because the last two days I was all over the place, and fortunately at Gullane you can miss a few fairways and be okay where I know next week I will not have that luxury.  So it was good to figure out the driver a little bit today and I'll carry that momentum into next week.
Q. It's been quite an emotional week as well coming back here.  Tell us a little bit about that.
LUKE LIST: Yeah, I was over here a dozen years ago and had a fantastic trip with my parents, and my dad passed away three years ago.  So it's definitely special memories with him over here and we were able to spread some of his ashes around different parts of the area, which really meant a lot to me and my mom and my wife now, and he was a fantastic guy.  He loved Scottish golf and I know he's looking down and smiling right now.
Q. You're the leader in the clubhouse.  You could be the winner in a few hours' time now.
LUKE LIST: Well, yeah.  Eddie is playing great, and it's hard to root against him.  My caddy is actually rooming with Mick Doran, his caddy, so it's going to be hard to root against him, and I know he's looking to qualify for the Open next week.  So I'm looking for him to post a number, but I'll wait around.
