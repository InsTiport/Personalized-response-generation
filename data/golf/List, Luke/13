 Q.  Finishing with a flurry there, the eagle at the 16th and bogey-free today.  Tell us about that eagle.  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, I pulled my drive a little bit and was lucky to stay out of the rough and had a really good number, 191, and just hit a nice 7-iron.  So I put a good swing on it and it was lucky to stop where it did and made a nice 4-footer there.   
 Q.  Was there a nice combination today of good play from you and absolutely perfect conditions out there of light breeze and sunshine?  
LUKE LIST: We have had really good conditions the last two days, which this golf course it definitely has some teeth if the wind picks up a little bit.  The greens are perfect, so just still have to put it in some good spots and you can get in trouble if you don't hit fairways.  So bogey-free I'm really happy with that and definitely want to roll some more putts in over the weekend.   
 Q.  I was going to ask you more about the weekend, with the 6-under par, five today.  Good momentum going into the final two days?  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, for sure.  Henrik had a real low one yesterday and there are some low ones out there if you hit fairways and greens, so I'll be looking to try to get, to keep taking advantage of the par-5s and maybe roll some more putts in.
