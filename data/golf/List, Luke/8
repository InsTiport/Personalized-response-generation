 Q.  Give us the key to that success.  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, I three putted No. 2, the par five.  Seemed like everybody -- to walk away with par that woke me up a little bit and I got off to a good run after that and holed a lot of mid-range putts, which I haven't been doing in the last month or two, so nice to see a few puts go in.   
The wind is a little tricky on the back, a bunch of crosswind and that left-to-right into on three or four holes so that's a bit tricky, out there and I just managed to make a few mid-range putts and that helps the score card.   
 Q.  How nice is it that you're going to be out early in the morning and you can build on the success and post a good score?  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, you know, the weather changes so much around here so hard to say if it will be a good draw or bad draw, but I think not too early is good.  I get to sleep in a little bit and hopefully get some fresh greens and get after that.   
 Q.  Coming over from the States, how important is this week with Carnoustie, playing on the links, and you've got experience this week of having shot that good score?  
LUKE LIST: It's been over a dozen years since I've been to the U.K. to play golf, and my first Open next week, so excited about that. Got some good memories here.  A dozen years ago, played Palmer Cup in southwest Scotland and come up here to Muirfield with my family here, so been a great start.   
 Q.  You've built up a great head of steam, how important to keep that momentum going tomorrow?  
LUKE LIST: I haven't gotten off to a lot of fast starts in first round of tournaments I've played, so it's nice to get near the lead or even if it in the lead, but just a good start would be really nice.
