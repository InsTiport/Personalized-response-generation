 Q.  Nice win.  Some comments on how the match progressed?  
LUKE LIST: I don't think either of us would be too pleased with how we played.  It was tricky out there.  The front nine was kind of bad, but actually played pretty solid on the back, so I was happy with that.   
 Q.  And a big win for you, you really needed it today.  
LUKE LIST: Yeah.  I mean, obviously I rooting for Matt tomorrow to knock off Rory, but that's going to be a tough feat.  And I've got my hands full with Justin.  All I can do is go get a win and hope for the best.   
 Q.  Compare the conditions you had out there today compared to yesterday?  
LUKE LIST: Pretty similar, maybe a little bit more wind.  But I played at 1 something yesterday.  The afternoon gets a little tricky.  The greens get a little quicker with the wind.  The holes on the water.  The wind is really whipping, so guys have their hands full.
