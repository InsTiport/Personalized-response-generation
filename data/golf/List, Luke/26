 Q.  Nicely done today, 5-under 66, different golf course than it was earlier in the week, wasn't it.  Talk about your round today?  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, Tuesday, Wednesday, this place was really firming up and then we got the rain yesterday which softened it up a little bit and made it easier to attack on some of the iron shots.  Such a great golf course and holds it's own no matter what the weather is.  To have no bogeys, I was really happy with it.   
 Q.  Nice up-and-downs at 7 and 8.  
LUKE LIST: 7, I just tucked my iron shot a little bit and that's not the easiest place, but hit a nice pitch and made a little 4-footer there.   
I like driver on 8.  I've always liked that play here.  Just pushed it a little bit and had a funky lie.  To get those two up-and-down kept me going for sure and definitely makes lunch taste better.   
 Q.  You had one really good tournament, and the last few weeks, it hasn't been going so good.  What's been the story?  
LUKE LIST: It's tough to see the MC next to your name, doesn't look that pretty.  I've had some nice rounds and I've missed a few cuts by one or two.  I feel like my game and my swing are good.  It's just kind of being a little more patient out there, the stuff we always hear.   
Seeing a guy like Vaughn do what he did last week, it shows that anybody out here can do it.  So looking forward to the next three days.
