 Q.  Very nice round today.  
LUKE LIST: Any time you go bogey-free out here it feels great.  To do it on Sunday it feels pretty good.   
 Q.  Was there a sense that this was coming?  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, I worked really hard this off season and the pieces started feeling like I was going to have some good results.  And it's always nice to see that coming together in the right direction.  I played nicely this week.  I knew that, if I played well, I like the golf courses out here, so it's fun to see some good numbers.   
 Q.  You hit the 16th green in two.  Tell us about that.  
LUKE LIST: Yeah, I had 216 front.  240 something to the hole and I hit a 4-iron that I really hit a nice little draw and it pitched perfect, probably 15 on, and then just kind of, I knew it was going to be toppling a little bit, I didn't expect it to get all the way there.  But I had a nice look at it there, it was a close look, but I kind of misread it a little bit and pulled it a little bit.  But I'll take the four there all day.   
 Q.  You were on TOUR in 2013.  Do you feel better prepared this time around?  
LUKE LIST: No question about it.  The WEB.COM is so solid now, the preparation for the big TOUR.  For me it was just, it took a little longer than a lot of guys to kind of feel comfortable, working on some stuff, health and mental preparation.  For me it's a few years longer than I would like, but it's good to be back and I'm looking forward to a good year.
