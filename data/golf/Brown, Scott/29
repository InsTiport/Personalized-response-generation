 Q.   1-under, 71 in the second round, Scott.   Are you happy with that?  
SCOTT BROWN:   I played okay today.   You know, I stayed patient and just didn't hit it as close as I did yesterday, and when I did, I just didn't make the putts that I made yesterday.   All in all, it was a good day.   Anytime you shoot under par on this golf course is a good round.  
   
 Q.   Those greens look really hard, physically hard out there.  
SCOTT BROWN:   Yeah.   They're baking out in the afternoon, obviously, and you get a little traffic on them.   You know, makes it tough in the afternoon.   That's why you see the scores are a little bit lower in the morning.   All in all, the course is holding up nice.   It's in fabulous shape.  
   
 Q.   Do you like the way the course is playing, firm and fast?  
SCOTT BROWN:   Just firm and fast enough.   It's not out of control and I'm sure it will firm up a little bit more over the weekend, but it's playing nicely.  
   
 Q.   Do you ever have any fun out there?   You hardly look like you smile at all.   You're smiling constantly.  
SCOTT BROWN:   I'm always having fun, man.   It's a great job we have, just living it up and blessed to be here, really.
