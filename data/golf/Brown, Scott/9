 Q.  Scott, 5-under today despite two bogies.  You had a lot of birdies out there today.  Getable scoring conditions?  
SCOTT BROWN: Yeah, very getable.  Obviously the wind died down today and little rain last night softened the greens up and kind of be a little more aggressive.  We had a great group.  We were kind of feeding off of each other.   
 Q.  You had an eagle for the second day in a row on 7.  What is it about that hole for you?  
SCOTT BROWN: I don't know.  It's been lucky so far this week.  I think I played it 5-under for the week.  Hopefully I got one more left if me tomorrow.   
 Q.  What about tomorrow, what are you going to do to prepare, what do you think you need to shoot tomorrow?  
SCOTT BROWN: Something low.  I think the weather is projected to be kind of the same as today.  I'm sure the scores will be low.  Something at least mid to low 60s.   
 Q.  Good luck tomorrow.  
SCOTT BROWN: Thanks.
