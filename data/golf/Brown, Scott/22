 Q.  Couple over par.  What made the big change, eight of your last 11, players shake their head all the time when you ask that one.  
SCOTT BROWN: I hit it really good coming in.  The last 11 holes, really.  I had a lot of good looks and made a couple lengthy putts and capitalized on the short ones.  But started off hitting it good, just couldn't get anything in.  And it just panned out.   
 Q.  This is a hard golf course to keep it going on.  You don't have birdie runs on this course and to do something like you did, it just doesn't happen on the South Course very often.  
SCOTT BROWN: For sure.  If you're out of position, you're immediately playing for par.  Fortunately, I drove it good and hit a lot of good iron shots today and a lot of really easy looks at birdie.   
 Q.  You've been out here for awhile.  The rough's not super long, but this is some of the thickest stuff that I've seen in a while.  You get in it, and I saw Baddeley from 120 yards only hit it 60 yards at 18?  
SCOTT BROWN: That was the game plan we were going with this week.  If we got it in there, hit a short enough club so you can get it somewhere around the green and try to play for par.  But you can't make any doubles around here.  You got to play for par or bogey when you get in that position.   
 Q.  What are you thinking about going there?  It's pretty easy to free wheel on that golf course when you know you don't have to shoot a low one?  
SCOTT BROWN: The rough's still thick over there.  You still got to drive it good to score over there.  I got to continue to drive it good and hopefully make some more birdies over there.
