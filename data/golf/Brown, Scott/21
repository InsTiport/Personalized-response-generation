Q. You missed the cut all three times, you've gotten off to a great start, that trend could easily change here this week.  An opening 9 -- started on the 10 -- and opening nine even par and then you go 6-under.  What changed for you as you made the turn?
SCOTT BROWN: Made a couple bogeys early in the round and I knew I was hitting it good.  I was hitting some good shots and just made a couple stupid bogeys.  Hit a ball in the hazard on the par-5 and made bogey on the par-5.
But I really hit some good shots.  I hit some close iron shots and fortunately made some putts.  It turned into birdieing my last eight out of my last 11.  So that was nice.
Q. To do it on the South Course, which traditionally is the more difficult of the two golf courses, now going to the North Course on Friday, what kind of mindset do you have after that good number on the more difficult golf course?
SCOTT BROWN: Yeah, obviously you try to go out and do the same thing.  The rough's still high over there and thick and you still got to drive it good to get your self in position.  But you can make a few more birdies out there, so I'll just try to keep the aggressive mindset over there and hopefully shoot another good number.
Q. If you had to describe the South Course, which if you do play on the weekend you play three times, how would you describe it to the average amateur out there?
SCOTT BROWN: Extremely hard.  It's a tough golf course.  But it's fair.  It's just tough.  If you're out of position, you just have to kind of play for par or bogey and you can't make any big numbers out here, because as soon as you get behind the eight ball, you can't press and try to make birdies, you got to kind of plot yourself around here and hopefully you get a few good looks like I did today.
