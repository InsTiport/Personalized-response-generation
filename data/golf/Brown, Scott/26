Q. Scott, tell us about this round. You made 6 birdies out there and played some excellent golf. Put yourself right in the mix.
SCOTT BROWN: Yeah. Putter got hot today more than anything. Actually hit it better yesterday. I made a few obviously but I left quite quit a few out there. The round yesterday was solid. The putter warmed up a little bit today, so I was able to make some birdies.

Q. What is it about this course that maybe you discovered the third time around that you hadn't in your two previous trips to this tournament?
SCOTT BROWN: You know, I don't know what it is. I love the golf course. Obviously I grew up on a golf course a lot like this, bermuda grass. So, I've always liked it. So hopefully the good vibes are kind of paying off.

Q. How are you feeling about the weekend now?
SCOTT BROWN: I feel good. If I can keep doing the same stuff, putter stays hot, I should be all right. I'm hitting it okay. Go work out a few little kinks on the range in a minute. I feel pretty good about the weekend.
