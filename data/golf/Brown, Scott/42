Q.   Great week for you.   Finished three rounds in the 60s.   Just some comments on the week. 
SCOTT BROWN:   You know, I think with the wife having a baby last week just kind of ‑‑ I didn't get here until Wednesday night late.   Not a whole lot expectations.
I think it just ‑‑ the result was a good week.   I think I just been putting too much pressure on myself. 

Q.   When was the baby born?
SCOTT BROWN:   Sunday morning 5:53.   I left the Greenbrier early.   Left at 2:00 in the morning.

Q.   Was there ever any consideration of not playing?
SCOTT BROWN:   When she had it, not really.   When she had the baby Sunday morning, we got out of the hospital Monday afternoon.   I spent two days with her before I left.
I planned on playing the whole time, especially when it came on Sunday morning. 

Q.   Playing next week as well?
SCOTT BROWN:   Playing next week.

Q.   Mom and baby good?
SCOTT BROWN:   Yeah, everybody is good.   She's probably going to make her first appearance at the Greensboro in a few weeks. 

Q.   It was a boy? 
SCOTT BROWN:   Girl, six pounds, five ounces. 

Q.   And the baby's name?
SCOTT BROWN:   Elizabeth Marie Brown.   We're calling her Elly, E‑l‑l‑y.
