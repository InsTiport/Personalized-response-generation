 Q.  Scott Brown, lovely round of golf today.  
 Talk a little bit about the conditions early on as compared to later on in your round.   
SCOTT BROWN: Yeah.  We started off the day, it was a little breezy but not bad.  Kind of picked up on about our 7th whole today which was 16.  We're trying to play fast enough to get in there before it picked up.  We didn't make it.   
But, you know, equal to yesterday, I would say.  It's blowing around pretty good and it will make scoring very tough.   
 Q.  You had 4 birdies but, unfortunately, that double bogey there on the 7th hole.  
 What happened to your second shot?   
SCOTT BROWN: I hit a bad shot and obviously the wind with the way it is magnified it.  You know, it's a right pin and trying to go just left and I pushed it a little bit and got going with the wind.   
Pushed it a little too far over there, misread the rye on the chip and, unfortunately, just, you know, a bad swing ended up being a double but lot of good stuff today for sure.   
 Q.  Yeah, I was just going to ask you, you generally very pleased with your day.  
SCOTT BROWN: Well, I mean it's funny.  My caddy and I were talking on the 8th tee.  We were like, you know, I told you you would be 2-under through 16 holes you'd take it out here with the way these conditions are.  So, it's the way you look at it.   
It's hard to go around here and not make a double or a bogey every now and then and just try to stay positive and keep doing what I'm doing and now it's kind of a blip and get over it quick.   
 Q.  Best of luck for the weekend and thanks for stopping by and talking to us.
