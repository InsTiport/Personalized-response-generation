Q.   They're asking just how overall play was for you today. 
SCOTT BROWN:   Good.   I kind of saw it coming really.   I've been playing really good.   I know my scores didn't show it.   But I felt like it was getting better each day.   Everything just kind of clicked today. 
I made some putts early, kind of got my confidence up. 
Then I just kind of took off from there.   Hit some good shots close.   Made some more putts throughout the day and just really a solid round overall.

Q.   How about going into tomorrow?
SCOTT BROWN:   The scores are low this year.   That's what's so weird about this tournament.   Hopefully I can shoot something low over there.   If the conditions stay like this, the scores are going to be low.   So, it's over there as well, so hopefully I'll get something going again tomorrow.

Q.   As far as birdies anything that you can comment on that.   Your strategies and how many. 
SCOTT BROWN:   I would love to shoot another 9‑.   9‑under will go a long way.   It may not win, but at least it will put me in a good place tomorrow.   So it will be a cool story to come back and play two good rounds, 62, 63 to finish, that would be nice.
