 Q.  Nice round.  5-under par.  A little bit up and down for you, too, wasn't it?  
SCOTT BROWN: You know, it actually was.  I started off kind of shaky with the ball striking early, but then I started hitting some really good shots kind of middle-ways through the round and all the way through the end.  It was actually really easy.   
I actually missed a few putts that were makable coming in to get to a better number.   
 Q.  I talked to some of the other players, and they thought some of the pin locations today were quite challenging.  
SCOTT BROWN: They were.  Seemed like I had good numbers all day where I could kind of land it towards the front half and get it to bounce back into the pin.   
Hopefully I will get good numbers throughout the rest of the week.   
 Q.  You mentioned about it being Day 1.  How do you carry this over to Day 2?  
SCOTT BROWN: Try to keep it the same thing.  I'm driving it pretty well and made some putts today, so I think keep shooting good scores.  You have to make some 15- to 20-footers.  It's hard to get it close with the greens this firm.  So just continue to do that.   
 Q.  How fun is this tournament?  It's unlike any other, isn't it?  
SCOTT BROWN: Yeah, it's really cool.  You know, obviously I grew up in Augusta, so it's a little bit different but the buzz is the same.  I was talking to my caddie yesterday, it's a lot louder but you get that vibe, that buzz, that excitement around the golf tournament, which is really cool.
