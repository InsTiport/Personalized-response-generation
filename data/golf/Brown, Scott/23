 Q.  So to start off, club and yardage?  
SCOTT BROWN: 6-iron, it was 186 to the hole, I believe.  It was kind of a weird number for me.  I was kind of right in between a 6-iron and 7-iron and chose to go 6-iron, took a little off of it and it never left the flag.  And then it hit probably 10 feet short and rolled right in.   
 Q.  What was your initial reaction?  
SCOTT BROWN: I walked up to that hole.  I made like three hole-in-ones in the last two years on TOUR and walking up looking at the card I thought, man, it would be nice to make a hole-in-one and win something.  Because the other three I made I got nothing.  So that was my thought walking um, I was trying to make a one.   
 Q.  Are you going to drive it home from here?  
SCOTT BROWN: Yeah, do you think they will let me do that?   
(Laughter.)  No.  BMW is a big part of South Carolina where I live as well, so it will be pretty cool.   
 Q.  And then how many hole-in-ones is that for your career?  
SCOTT BROWN: I think I'm up to eight now.  Eight, three on TOUR in the last, or four now on TOUR in the last two years.   
 Q.  Some guys don't even make one.  
SCOTT BROWN: I know.   
 Q.  What does that say?  
SCOTT BROWN: I got lucky.  I got lucky bounces.   
 Q.  This has to be the best one, isn't it?  
SCOTT BROWN: Oh, yeah, the prize makes it the best one.
