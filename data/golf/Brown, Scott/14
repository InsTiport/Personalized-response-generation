Q. So you're obviously familiar with facing this hole.  You want to talk a little about about today, how it was playing, club selection, your reaction?
SCOTT BROWN: Last year opposite wind, one club less.  Today it was 7-iron and it was pretty much identical.  It almost landed pretty much in the identical spot, like a foot short of the hole and I guess I can't see from it down there but I'm guessing it just hopped in.  I've only seen the other shot off of commercials now.  It's very similar to the way it landed.
Q. How often do you see those commercials?
SCOTT BROWN: All the time.  I watch Golf Channel all the time.
Q. Well, that's five holes in the last two years.
SCOTT BROWN: The last three, maybe.
Q. That's pretty good.
SCOTT BROWN: Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope I can keep that streak alive, really.  I like to keep making them.  But, yeah, I mean I'm on a good run right now for sure.
Q. They keep playing back to back.  Last year's reaction, you're obviously playing with Tiger, had a huge crowd there for that and again where it did look identical.
SCOTT BROWN: Yeah.  It was about 25,000 less people there this year but Boo, I was playing with Boo obviously, today and Boo said that's the first time he ever put a 1 on the card, too.  Same thing Tiger said to me last week.  I don't know.
Q. I know the people at Quicken Loans are happy to have you part of this program and you've got one lucky fan, another one year of free mortgage.
How does that make you feel?
SCOTT BROWN: That's so cool to be able to give somebody a mortgage for a year, really cool.
Q. Have you heard from those fans?
SCOTT BROWN: You know what, I really haven't, I don't think, but one guy may have tweeted me one time on one of my first ones, but not really, not really.
Q. Got like a thank you card?
SCOTT BROWN: I wish.  No, just kidding.  Pretty cool, though.
