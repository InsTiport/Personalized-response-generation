SCOTT BROWN: I hung tight all day and made a few birdies late to get it back under par.  So pretty proud of the way I finished.
Q. I was going to ask that.  How proud are you of the performance?  Because that gets you into the championship heading into the weekend.
SCOTT BROWN: Absolutely.  Anything under par around these two golf courses in general are usually pretty good.  So just kind of wanted to keep fighting and stay in the mix.
Q. You'll go a couple of shots back with the likes of Dustin Johnson, Gary Woodland.  Two bombers out there.  How much confidence will you take from your 66 on day one playing the South Course?
SCOTT BROWN: Obviously those guys have a huge advantage because of their length off the tee.  So I just need to go out and hit fairways.  I'm striking my irons really well, so if I can hit some fairways hopefully I'll have a lot of good looks at birdie.
Q. And because you have those good memories, particularly on that course, it bodes well?
SCOTT BROWN: Absolutely, I think it definitely helps.  Coming into yesterday I hadn't had much success on that golf course.  So I've always loved the golf course, just never played it that well.  So hopefully it will carry over to tomorrow.
