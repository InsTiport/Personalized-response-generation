 Q.   Just talk about the round.   
SCOTT BROWN:   It was a fun day.   You know, I got it going early on the front nine, kind of got myself in contention for the golf tournament and then Brian is just playing so good.   He got it going on the back nine, and he was just climbing the leaderboard and I kind of stayed stagnant and didn't make any birdies coming in.  
   
 Q.   Talk about being in it right there today and just couldn't quite get there.   
SCOTT BROWN:   Yeah, I mean, you know, I played great.   It's just hard to catch a guy who's playing that good.   I mean, I had to go out and shoot 7‑ or 8‑under just to win the golf tournament today.   All in all a good week.   I took a lot of positives from it.
