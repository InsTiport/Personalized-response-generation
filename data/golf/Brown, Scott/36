Q.   Well, Scott, let's talk about today first.   Right there on the Back 9, last few holes you were right there with a chance to win.   Were you watching the scoreboard, you knew where you stood?
SCOTT BROWN:   Yeah, I knew where I stood.   I was stand on 15.   I knew I probably needed to birdie out to have a chance and was able to get two of them but not four, so unfortunately just a little short.

Q.   Good week, though.   Man, I've enjoyed watching you this week because your game is in a really, really good place right now, isn't it?
SCOTT BROWN:   Yeah, it is. 
Everything seems to be clicking, you know.   All the hard work in the off season is kind of paying off.   So looking forward to kind of the rest of the '14 season.

Q.   And I watched you at the Frys and of course this week.   You gotta feel like, man, you're on the cusp of winning again?
SCOTT BROWN:   Yeah, I mean I feel good about it.   Just need to kind of work out just a few things to kind of get over the hump, make a few more putts along the way, I think I'll be right there.

Q.   Are you going to Mexico?
SCOTT BROWN:   Definitely, going to Mexico..
