 Q.   Can you put that round into terms for us?  
ROGER SLOAN:   I got off to a really good start, battling some nerves my first Canadian Open weekend.   It was a real treat to play with Vijay and see some really tremendous golf early on, but didn't quite finish the way I wanted to, but we've got another day tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What was it like playing alongside Vijay?  
ROGER SLOAN:   He was just a gentleman.   He was a real class act.   It was real nice to play with him, and he keeps the game real simple:   Fairways, greens and putts.   Pretty simple game.  
   
 Q.   Is there any intimidation when you're paired up with a guy like Vijay?  
ROGER SLOAN:   Not really.   I mean, this is where I want to be.   This is where my career is headed, and it's just nice to play with somebody with a tremendous amount of experience, and you can absorb of stuff from him, and today was a great learning experience.  
   
 Q.   How is the course playing?   Obviously a lot of low numbers out there.   
ROGER SLOAN:   Yeah, with no wind out here, soft conditions, I saw them watering the greens last night, so you could kind of fire at the pins out there today.   There were some good pin positions, and you could take advantage of the parâ€‘5s out here, which really helps.  
   
 Q.   Plan of attack for tomorrow?  
ROGER SLOAN:   Just keep sticking to what I'm doing and get some putts to go.   Play steady and continue to learn and develop my career.  
   
 Q.   What's it like to walk up 18?   
ROGER SLOAN:   It was a little tough today because I was way off course.   I didn't get to observe that too much.   But it means so much to me to play in my national open here on the weekend in front of the greatest golf fans in the world, and I'm having a lot of fun out here, and thanks to all the people that are out there supporting.
