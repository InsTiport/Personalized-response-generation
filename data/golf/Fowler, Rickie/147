Q. You triple bogeyed your second hole, but then after that really turned things around.  What were you able to shift mentally after that triple bogey to put the number up you did?
RICKIE FOWLER: I got some really good work in this morning.  Joe and I came up and really did some extra practice in this morning.
I got off to a nice start with the birdie on 1.  I felt like I was in good position, hitting shots that I wanted to.  I had to kind of settle down after that.  Three-putt bogey on the 4th, but kind of got going from there.  It was a bit hot and cold, the putter.  I think I had three three-putts out there, but was able to roll a few in and get the bonus at the last.
Q. Describe the shot on the hole-out.
RICKIE FOWLER: It's nearly impossible, kind of.  And when I saw this come out, I said there's no way it's staying short.  A little bit of a downslope.  It's somewhat firm bunker, which is nice, you're able to put spin on the ball.  You saw Eric had to kind of two checks on it.  It's not an easy one.
Joe actually brought up a past experience there when I was in that bunker to that pin, before Butch and I were able to get some good bunker work in.  Back then I told -- he brought it up again, he said I wasn't sure how to hit the shot or if I could keep it on the green, and then I go and do that.  My bunker game is in a little better position now.
Q. You really were able to grind it out?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, actually, I started off nice on 1.  2, a different story.  Started off with two good swings, birdie on 1, just a bad swing off the tee on 2.  And the triple bogey after the three-putt.
Joe and I came out early this morning, got some extra work on the game.  Just had to sit back and believe and trust that.
After I made another bogey at 4, 3-over, and still had to be patient.  Good thing everything -- all that happened early in the round.  I had plenty of time to go out and play and make something happen.  There's a lot of birdies on this golf course if you hit the fairways and greens.  It was nice to fight back, and capitalize with a little bonus on the last.
Q. How hard is it to give yourself that pep-talk?  I have a lot of holes left, I have the whole tournament in front of me.
RICKIE FOWLER: To look at it, knowing that I made a good swing on 1, and made a birdie there, I still had all the par-5s in front of me.  You have some par-4s with a wedge in your hand.
My goal was to just try and fight back to even at the turn.  I was able to one better that with a nice putt on 9.  So just kind of trying to pick things off one by one.  And it's nice that it did happen.
Q. Short field, just 120 here.  You don't have all that much foot traffic on the greens.  I thought the greens held up all day long and you had a smooth roll?
RICKIE FOWLER: It did.  I really only had a couple of putts from a little longer distance that I can see hop a little bit once they got going.  Other than that they did great.  I did make some good, long putts.  And a good roll and true for the most part.  Like you said, smaller field, not too much foot traffic, but when you are playing later in the afternoon it's nice to see them hold up.
