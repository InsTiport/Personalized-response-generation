 Q. Talk about the coliseum, the 16th. 
 RICKY FOWLER: It's been a few times I looked around and saw a bunch of people, but I like playing around big crowds, a bunch of people, and this is the best place to do it.

 Q. What did the guys say to you? What did the fans say to you as you were playing the 16th? 
 RICKY FOWLER: Well, I got a few boos. I hit it a little long, on the back of the green, and they were shouting out my high school mascot. Then I got a few more boos when I three-putted for bogey. 

 Q. First time going through 16 here. How would you describe it?
 RICKY FOWLER: Awesome. No, it's a great place. I love playing in front of big crowds, and people being loud doesn't really bother me. It kind of hypes me up a little bit and makes me play a little better. I had a rough finish there, three-putted for bogey on 16 and bogeyed 17. But I had a great time and am having fun out here this week.

 Q. Describe for me your emotions walking through that tunnel to get to the 16th tee. 
 RICKY FOWLER: I couldn't wait for it. It's what I've been waiting for all week, and that's one of the main reasons I wanted to get out here and make the cut.
