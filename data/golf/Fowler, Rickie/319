Q.   What is your verdict on this week overall? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   I'm pleased with the week.   Happy to be in contention, coming right back out, first event of the year.   Yeah, just a few mistakes kept me from getting the win.   But like I say, I'm happy with some good, solid play. 

Q.   Certainly you had your moments, even deep into the back nine there?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, it was nice to sneak back in there and be really in the hunt.   Coming down the last, I had a good opportunity there on 18 and hit the shot I wanted to.   Just got a little bit more hurt and played a little longer than I was expecting.

Q.   I suppose it sums up this game when you have your partner and see Bubba Watson chipping in at the last for eagle?
RICKIE FOWLER:   You never know what he's going to do.   Fun, obviously fun, being able to play alongside him, Tim Clark, as well.   We had a good time out there today.   Nice to see him rebound from a couple mistakes he made early before the last few holes there.   But yeah, couldn't really do anything more.   I hit the shot I wanted to and definitely made a good five at the last to finish posting a 10.

Q.   Overall enjoyed the experience? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, enjoyed the week.   Great time being here in Shanghai, definitely thanks to HSBC for putting on a great event.   They do an awesome job and I look forward to being back next year. 

Q.   Another good finish, must set you up pretty well for the season. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, to have that coming off some weeks off, just to put together some solid rounds of golf, a few mistakes out there but when you look at the scores, they were solid and consistent.   Yeah, I'm excited, get home, enjoy a little bit more time off and get the game ready.   Enjoy Thanksgiving before Tiger's and Christmas, really get things going in January. 

Q.   What was your number for that 5‑wood on the second shot?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I think I had 228 front.   It was a decent number.   Back home I fly 5‑wood about 245.   I knew I needed to get a good one but it was almost, looking at the numbers, it would have been kind of squeezing through it a little bit too much.
But obviously now looking back, it may have been the right club.   But like I said I hit the shot I was trying to hit and just unfortunately kind of misjudged how far it was going to play.

Q.   How would you describe the sequence of events of 16, 17 and then 18? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, 16, not sure.   The wedge shot on 16, it's not hard to do on these fairways.   They are tight.   He had an into‑the‑grain lie.   That's not hard to do, especially trying to hit to a tight pin.   So he makes a good five there after being in a tough position.
These bunkers do have a lot of sand in them so it wasn't an easy bunker shot where he was, upslope rebound downhill.   That can also happen easily, being under the gun with pressure everything and, those two things happened like that (snapping fingers).   It was unfortunate to see them, one after the other.   Obviously he figured something out in the sand and figured it out on 18.

Q.   Why did he back off? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Bunch of cameras all day, cell phone cameras.   It was all day. 

Q.   Did you have big crowds all week?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Decent.   Today was definitely the most people out for sure as a whole, seeing everyone around the course.   Last two groups had good followings.

Q.   Any change, knowledge, gallery‑wise?
RICKIE FOWLER:   A little bit.   The language barrier is tough, just because I mean they may kind of understand what we're saying, like no cell phones and stuff but, hey, if they were not taking pictures of us, there would be a problem.   They are out here watching us, supporting us.   It would be nice if the phones were on silent, it would make it a lot easier.   But they do enjoy watching golf.   They enjoy good golf and glad we were able to do that.   This is the first time I've played well here. 

Q.   3‑wood on the last? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   5‑wood, 228 and just misjudged how far it was going to play.

Q.   Did you give any thought to laying up? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   No. 

Q.   The lie was good enough. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   The lie was nice.   Part of it is, I thought it could have maybe come out a little hotter out of the first cut and it didn't.   But I hit it in the center of the face, so it was out of my hands once it did that.
