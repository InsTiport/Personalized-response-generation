 Q.  Talk about the thrill of getting the first point for the U.S.  
RICKIE FOWLER: That's great, to go out with DJ, I knew it was going to be a good time.  And we just played some sold golf.  When one of us was out of the hole, the other picked the guy up and played some solid golf.  We knew that was going to be needed against Rory and ThorbjÃ¸rn.  They're great ball-strikers, and knew it was going to be a tough match.   
 Q.  DJ, what makes Rickie the right partner for you, outside of the shots he hits?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, I think we get along very well.  Our demeanours are pretty similar, especially on the golf course.  We practise a lot together.  We spend a lot of time together, whether out here this week or even at home.  We felt we'd be really good partners, and so far so good.
