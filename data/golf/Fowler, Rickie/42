RICKIE FOWLER: (Indiscernible) other than that, scorable.  See some scores.  I feel like I left a few out there.  It's just a good test.
Q. (Indiscernible) you feel comfortable going into the weekend?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I do.  I feel good with where we're at.  Haven't had my best stuff.  Just managed my way of getting around and moving forward.  Looking forward to tightening a few things up, make some more putts.  That's always nice.  I've been hitting a lot of good putts.  I'm happy with where we're at.  I'll just clean a little bit up and see the green, and we'll be in a good spot.
