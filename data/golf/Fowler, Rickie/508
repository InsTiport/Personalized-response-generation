 Q. You put yourself right into contention for a huge weekend. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Right where I want to be. You know, I came into this week after a nice week off, feeling good, and rested and ready to go and playing for the W.

 Q. 11 of 14 fairways and you're averaging 309 off the tee. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: I'm hitting it well. Most of that is just hitting the ball solid. The fairways have firmed up a bit, so we're getting a little bit of roll, which is nice. The greens are starting to firm up. Definitely hitting fairways is a key out here.

 Q. You kind of introduced yourself to the PGA TOUR back in the fall a few miles from here at Grayhawk. Some unfinished business left here in the desert, maybe take care of that?
 RICKIE FOWLER: We were close back at the end of October there at Grayhawk at the Fry's. We had a good shot at it. Hopefully we'll give ourselves a better one this year.
