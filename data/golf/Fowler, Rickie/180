Q. Dan was just saying nobody had a lead in this match of more than 1-up.  What were the range of emotions for you out there today?
RICKIE FOWLER: I tried to stay pretty mellow and level throughout the day.  Like you said, it was back and forth right around 1-up.  I was 1-down for the most part and then got it back to square was able to get it 1-up with a few to play.
A bit of an uphill fight for the both of us.  I know Rosey and I didn't have our best.  We were evenly matched we kind of kept going back and forth.  Fun match.  Won't be the last between us.  Obviously pleased to come out on top.
Q. How do you balance the pressure of the moment with also understanding what's on the line?
RICKIE FOWLER: Just trying to focus on just the one single job and that was playing that match against Rosey.  Obviously a lot more going on outside of just our match, but really can't worry and think about that too much.  You hear the roars and see the scoreboards here and there, but try to just focus on playing my game and going head-to-head with Rosey.
