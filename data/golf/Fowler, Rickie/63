Q. Wondered what you felt about the match.
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, other than the first hole, we got off to a decent start and I was able to make birdie on 2 and 3.  It just seemed that a few of the times when we made birdie that they were able to top us, and they made some good par saves to kind of hold their lead and continue their momentum.
So it was tough to get that momentum to switch.  We finally got one back on 11.  DJ made a great putt.  You know, they topped our birdie on 13 and just tough to get things, like I said, heading our way.  I got a putt that I felt like would have given us a good chance with the four holes ahead that horseshoed on 14.
So yeah, it was just couldn't really get much to go our way.
Q. Do you get a feel for what it's going to take to crack into that lead and beat these guys in some way and catch them?
RICKIE FOWLER: Ball-striking, first.  This golf course, you've got to get the ball in the fairway, and at least give yourself opportunities.  Then once that happens, we need to start making some more putts as a team.  I think it was nice to see J.T. and Jordan at least get one point for us in this morning's session.
See if we can carry some of that momentum from those boys into this afternoon.  I'll be out there cheerleading.
