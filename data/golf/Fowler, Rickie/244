 Q.  65, how happy are you with that?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Definitely pleased, with it being the third round, part on Saturday, part on Sunday.  Nice to move up and get myself in a good position to win this afternoon.  Still got a lot of work to do, but the game feels good and excited for the challenge ahead.   
 Q.  Just looking at your putting, the statistics show that you are outside of the Top-100 on the first day but a big jump up since then.  What do you put that down to?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I've been putting well.  I just happened, maybe a little reading and speed the first day.  So took care of that.  Been hitting some good putts the past two rounds.  It's hard to say the last two days, because we've been up early trying to finish with the fog and everything.   
So yeah, the game feels good.  It's nice to feel comfortable on the greens and looking forward to have some opportunities this afternoon.   
 Q.  You have a handsome lead at the moment but quite a stellar field behind you.  What's the strategy going into this afternoon's final round?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I definitely feel a lot more comfortable this year on the golf course than last year.  Confident with where the game is at.  Stick to the game plan and play the course how we've been playing it.  Yeah, I'm going to have to earn this win, because there's a lot of guys at the top of the leaderboard right now and won't be easy.   
 Q.  Is there a target score in mind?  
RICKIE FOWLER: No, not really.  I would take another 65, that would be great.  But really just got to go out there, get situated, get comfortable and stick to the game plan, like I said, stay patient is a big thing and make sure we stay within the moment.
