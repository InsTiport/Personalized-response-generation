 Q. (No Microphone.)  
RICKIE FOWLER: I finally got one in there close in two on 15 and kind of got something going. No, we just did a good job, stayed patient all day, had a lot of good 2‑putts, par saves, just kind of kept the round going. Just managed to get a couple close coming back in.   
   
 Q. The conditions were easy but the pins were quite tricky today, were they not?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, they were tough, some pins that I feel like sometimes you typically see on the weekend. The greens were tough to control the ball on, just firm enough where still playing out of the fairway, if you didn't hit your spot perfectly, you end up a little too far from the hole and then you're just trying to get good speed and maybe it goes in, if you get lucky. But I felt like there was a lot of times out there you're just trying to make a par and move on. And unfortunately I couldn't get, take care of or take advantage of the par‑5s early, but nice to at least get one of them there on 15. But yeah, it didn't play easy out there. I saw Jordan got it to 6 or so, but anything under par was a good round of golf today.
