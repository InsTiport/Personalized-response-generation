 Q.  Is it tougher this year?  
RICKIE FOWLER: No, I just played pretty bad.   
 Q.  Can you talk about playing at Torrey Pines and what it's like to be here and in San Diego.  The weather is perfect.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it's always fun being here in San Diego.  It's a home tournament for me.  Having the association and partnership that I do with Farmers.  Yeah, we got great weather this week, so hopefully I can play a little better.   
 Q.  How would you describe a round like today?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Terrible.  I think that sums it up pretty easily.  It was just bad golf.  Couldn't get anything going.  Couldn't make a putt.  So, hopefully looking forward to getting on the South greens, that's for sure.   
 Q.  Is it just golf or can you determine why?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Just golf.  I made some good swings out there.  Made some bad ones.  But yeah, it was like my ball was scared of the hole or something.   
 Q.  It's not common to hear someone say I can't wait to get to the South Course.  But you still have to have some hopes that even though it's the harder course that it will be better for you?  
RICKIE FOWLER: It's one of the my favorite courses we get to play all year.  So I'm looking forward to getting out there tomorrow.  I've been playing well.  I know can I shoot a good score down there.  So, yeah, just unfortunate to get off to the start that I did today.   
 Q.  Was fatigue a factor at all today?  
RICKIE FOWLER: No.  I've been playing well, coming off a win last week, I felt good coming in here, got the rest that I needed, but I just got it going the wrong way today.   
 Q.  Any comments on the shoes, the high tops?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Got my high tops on, yeah.
