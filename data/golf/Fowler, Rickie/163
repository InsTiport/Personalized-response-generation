 Q.  In hindsight, is there anything you would have changed about the game plan or how things went the first few holes?  
RICKIE FOWLER: No.  Actually just an alignment problem that just caused me to make a couple bad swings.  Cost me a few shots.  Nice that I got it turned around and started to make some good swings and made some birdies and fought back, got a good finish out of it.  No, happy about it.  Obviously, yeah, I would have like to have gotten off to a better start.   
Russell played awesome today.  It was fun to watch.  Nice to at least kind of jump on the birdie train with him on the back-9.  Happy for him and see him here in a couple days at Augusta.   
No.  Very, very positive week with the work I got with Butch Monday, Tuesday, the way I was able to play.  Make a bunch of birdies.  We got to tighten a couple things up.  Probably not tomorrow.  I know the weather won't be very good in Augusta.  Tuesday, Wednesday, and I'm excited to tee it up Thursday.   
 Q.  Are you able to put this little bit disappointment today behind you and focus more on what you're able to get out through the week as a whole?  
RICKIE FOWLER: For sure.  I'm happy about it.  Come here -- for me I come here as a prep for next week and I did, you know, as much as I wanted to, if not more.  Winning would have been a bonus for sure and obviously that's what I would have liked to have done.  To come out of here in a better mindset than I was going in, feeling good about the work that we did, and being able to, like I said, kind of turn things around out there when I knew there was something off and was able to figure that out and get it going.
