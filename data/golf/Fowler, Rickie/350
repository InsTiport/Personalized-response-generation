Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: It was pretty good.  Definitely off to a good start.  I'm definitely happy with the round.  Made a lot of good swings out there.  Made a lot of good putts.  Just didn't finish as strong as I'd like to.  Good solid start at an Open, at a major.  I'm happy about it.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, yeah, Sergio and I have been paired together quite a bit in the past year, year and a half or so.  Definitely enjoy playing together.  Felt like we were going back and forth a little bit there.  It was fun to be able to feed off of each other.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: A little bit.  It's still a tough driving golf course, and you have to hit the ball in the fairways and avoid the bunkers. You're still trying to hit it in certain spots off the tee, but into the greens you're able to be a little bit more aggressive especially with mid-irons and down.  Especially if you're playing out of the fairway, have full control of your golf ball, didn't have to -- especially if you're playing out of the fairway.  You didn't have to worry too much about what the wind was doing.  And the course was accessible if you were playing from the fairway.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: Well, it was definitely -- some of the holes played shorter where a hole was into the wind.  I think one hole I was hitting driver, 5-iron, I hit 3-iron, 7-iron.  It wasn't downwind or anything.  But the golf course can change so much just based on wind and what the weather is doing. I thought the course played great today.  The pins were -- nothing was crazy.  It was all right there.  If you drove it in the fairway, you could take advantage of it.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: Maybe five or so.  Five or six.  I don't know.  Five sounds good.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: I kept it on through the day.  It's kind of fun to see which guys are playing well.  Some of my buddies up there, and Brooks is a neighbor down in Florida and a buddy, and finished well at the Open back home.  It's good to see him get off to a good start here. Obviously Rory is off to a good start.  The kids are hanging around.  Feel like we can get a young one to win this week, if we continue to play the way we have today.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, Augusta this year is definitely the most comfortable I've felt in a major, especially being at Augusta and felt very comfortable at the U.S. Open.  And to come here playing well last week, definitely get the heart pumping a little bit on the first tee shot here.  And walking up the 18th with the stands and everything.  But I was able to settle in nicely and felt very comfortable out there today.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: I definitely enjoy playing in the wind.  I like -- today it's almost like some of the holes were playing, if it's playing off to the right or the left, you can use the wind as some sort of a wall on certain sides of the hole, and today there wasn't really that.  You just had to step up and hit a good shot to hit the fairway. Sometimes you can use the wind to your advantage if you know how to play it properly.  So that's why I enjoy playing here.  I feel like I can control my ball out in the wind.  Whatever the weather does or decides to do, we'll be ready to play.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: Back when I grew up in Southern California it usually blew about 15 to 20 every afternoon.  I did play a lot in the wind when I was growing up.  And then at school in Oklahoma, there's a lot of days where it blew more than 20.  So I've seen a lot of different conditions where it's blowing and 30 and 40 degrees out.  I'm not a stranger to playing in cold, windy weather.  Whatever we get over here we're ready.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, played well at St. Georges on Saturday there.  We played well -- it's not easy to do it.  It's the same for everyone.  So it's kind of just go at it with a good mindset and try to keep moving forward out there.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: Well, I had three weeks off, so I was able to kind of relax and get ready for the two weeks over here.  The biggest thing was getting over and playing the Scottish, and kind of checking the game and seeing where it was at, and shaking off a few things the first couple days there.  And able to get into the weekend and build some confidence off of that event with a good solid finish.  With the round I had on Sunday there definitely gave me some confidence going into this week.Q. (Inaudible.)RICKIE FOWLER: I think the biggest thing for me is just going through the process on every shot and making sure that I'm fully prepared to hit the golf shot that's in front of me.  Sometimes I get a little quick or a little haze over some golf shots.  Bad golf swings will happen, you're going to miss shots, but trying to limit that as much as possible.  That's what I felt I've done the best this year in majors and leading up, as far as preparation goes.
