 Q.   Obviously the day didn't end how you'd like it to, but nice start to the day with the hole‑out on 1?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah.   Had a nice start.   A little hiccup on 2 in the water, but other than that, I played solid all day.   I hit a lot of good shots, made a few good putts.   
Yeah, then three‑putted on the last hole.   Not the best way to go out, but all in all it was a great week, nice to come back after a few months off.   The game feels good.   It was nice to get out and back in competition.   
Not exactly in contention where I want to be, but good week all in all and had a fun week.   
   
 Q.   Is your back holding up okay?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, the back feels good.   I've still got a little ways to go with it, but definitely a good week to test it out.   Playing the shark shoot‑out next week as well.   So looking forward to continuing to get better.   And like I said, the game feels like it's in a great spot right now, hitting it really well, and looking forward to the 2013 season.
