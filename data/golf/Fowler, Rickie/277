Q. Your first hole, the 10th for the day.  You came back with an ace on your final hole.  That, of course, is the highlight of your round. Walk us through the shot.  What did you use there off the tee?RICKIE FOWLER: Just choked down 7-iron.  Made a great swing.  Swinging well all day.  I really didn't get a whole lot out of it.  Bogey at the 1st.  Went back out after the start, made a poor chip and 3-putt for bogey.  So, good little rebound making a 1.  We had 176 was the adjusted number.  Spun to the right.  I was trying to cut it.  Rolled in with perfect speed.Q. How many competitive aces is this for you?RICKIE FOWLER: My second.  Last one was my first PGA TOUR start as a pro at the Frys.  It's been a little while.  They're worth waiting for.Q. Is this the kind of shot, since it was your final shot of the day, that you can build momentum for a second round tomorrow?RICKIE FOWLER: Well, I've been swinging really well; the win at the Scottish, I swung really well at The Open, especially the first three days.  Couldn't get anything out of it. Continuing to swing well here and as you see there I hit a great shot.  Get a little bit of a good kick.  Hey, we'll take it.  Looking forward to getting back out tomorrow and see if we can get some putts to go.Q. Talking about what you did on the final, how would you access the other 17?RICKIE FOWLER: Other than the two bogies, those were ones that shouldn't have happened.  Other than that I played okay and got it around, kept it good and had a lot of good looks at birdie.  Pretty stress-free day.Q. Not quite had the run that you had last year but you still have a Major left.  How much are you focusing now on the PGA championship?RICKIE FOWLER: It would be nice to get a win to make it three wins this year, obviously The Players being a huge win there and backing it up at the Scottish which was another great field before The Open. To be able to have a chance to win a Major this year would be really special.  Those are definitely the events I want to gear up for and make sure I have a chance to go and be in contention like I was last year. Haven't been on point those weeks yet.  As I said, at The Open I was really swinging well and didn't get anything out of it.  If I would have made some putts there I could have given myself an opportunity.  But cool to see Zach win there and see if I give myself a chance at the PGA.Q. Lots of Thursday folks in the clubhouse.  Enjoy the rest of your afternoon.RICKIE FOWLER: I will
