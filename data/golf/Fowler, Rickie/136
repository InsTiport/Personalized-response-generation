Q. Another good week in the Scottish.  What positives do you take into next week?
RICKIE FOWLER: Just getting used to playing back over here and playing in the wind.  The wind tends to be a bit heavier over here, so just getting used to that again, getting the shots in the conditions over here.  So I'm really looking forward to next week.  Feel like I've got a lot of good stuff done here.
Played some good golf.  Looking forward to getting on the greens down there.  Didn't make as many putts as I would like to have week but got everything done I would have liked to swing-wise.  Yeah, ready for next week.
Q. At the U.S. Open, Butch mentioned as well in our commentary, you're trying to take things a little more slowly, a little more gentle with the pace, if you like, a bit more in the moment.  How big a key, how big a focus will that be?
RICKIE FOWLER: The big thing is just going down and learning the golf course the first few days.  There's potential weather on Wednesday, so may only have two days to really do that.  Just really getting ready to focus on Thursday and getting off to a good start.
Really can't think of the week as a whole.  I have to start preparation first and go out and get off to a good start and go from there.  I've done a good job of that at the first two majors, getting off to great starts and putting myself in good position and I felt like we did a lot better job on Sunday at the U.S. Open than we did at the Masters.  It's always a learning process.  It's always about feeling better in the moment every time.  So if you can continue to do that and trend the right direction, then all good.
