Q. Did you see the morning scores, and did you think the course was gettable when you were going in the afternoon round?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, once we went to warm up on range, I could see a little bit on the board because it was a big board on the side of the range.  I saw the lead got to 10, and there were a few guys out there, and I had moved back a bit.  I obviously knew that the course was gettable if you hit fairways.  That's the biggest thing.  So that was kind of the main goal and focus coming off yesterday, keep it in the fairway.  So I feel like we're in a pretty good spot.
Q. I was going to say you rebounded from the bogey with three birdies.  Do you feel like you're positioned well with the rain delay and heading out tomorrow morning?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I feel like we're in a great spot.  Obviously, it would be nice to keep going after birdieing 8 and 10.  I feel like we're in a good spot.  But the nice thing about the delay and going back out tomorrow morning, we'll get fresh greens.  So that will be nice for the final eight holes of the second round.  So we'll see.  I don't necessarily -- we'll see how the waves play out and how the scoring is.  Obviously, great scoring in the late early wave, and we'll see if we can go take advantage of good conditions in the morning.
