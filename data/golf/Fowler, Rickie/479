 Q. Nice solid start for you. It should be as it's your home course. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, this is our first PGA TOUR start as a pro last year. I've got some time on this course now that I spent a year living here. 
 It was nice to get out and make some birdies early. Kind of slowed it up when I got to the front nine. 

 Q. One of the birdies you made was on our Kodak challenge hole. Had a nice look at eagle. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Had a very nice look at eagle. Had it right online. The putt was a little bit slower than I thought, came up about a foot short. Perfect line.

 Q. Are you cognizant when you tee off that is the Kodak challenge hole or is it just another hole during the course of the round?
 RICKIE FOWLER: It's just another hole. We definitely know it's the Kodak hole, trying to play it the best we can.
 Obviously, got the 4 today. We're going to try to go out and make a 3 the rest of the week.

 Q. You have a lot of travel coming up. Heading over to Malaysia. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Heading to Malaysia Sunday. I think we fly out Sunday night. We don't land till Tuesday afternoon or Tuesday night. Going to be a quick turnaround. Waiting to see if we get in HSBC. So it could be a busy couple weeks. 

 Q. A win here takes care of an awful lot of undone business for you for the rest of the year. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: The win is kind of the one part of my season that's been left out. Playing and getting my card back for 2011, making the Ryder Cup team, having a pretty solid year. 
 The only thing left out is that win. It would be nice to win here for my first time.
