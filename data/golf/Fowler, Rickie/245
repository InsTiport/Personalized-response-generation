 Q.  Couple of birdies, nice way to finish.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, last two holes, played 10 and 11, hit some good shots.  Made a good putt to finish the day on 11.  Yeah, game feels good.  Happy to make a couple there at the last.  Decided to hit the putt on 11 after the horn blew.  Just wanted to make it to kind of keep things going, and looking forward to getting back out tomorrow.   
 Q.  Put yourself in a good position but quite a packed leaderboard.  Are you looking forward to the challenge?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, like I said, the game feels really good and I'm swinging really well.  I've kind of rounded into form as the week has gone on.  Looking forward to getting back, get some food, rest.  It's going to be a long day tomorrow and hopefully a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  Difficult circumstances, but obviously doesn't affect you, you're used to this kind of thing?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  A lot of golf to be played.  More time to make birdies.
