 Q. That was just incredible, 3-down with three to play in an absolutely crucial match, describe how it feels to pull it off. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: It's awesome. It was a position where it was nothing to lose. Had to go for it. Edoardo played great all day. He hit a lot of great shots and you know forced me to make some putts at the end.

 Q. The whole team standing watching over that last putt, describe what you're thinking and feeling as you struck it?
 RICKIE FOWLER: I told myself, I picked out a spot, I told myself just hit a good putt, and what happens, is what happens, and I hit a good one and went right in the middle.
