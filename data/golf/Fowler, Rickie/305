 Q.   You went all the way to the 18th hole with Harris.   What was the difference today between the two of you?  
    RICKIE FOWLER:   Kind of went back and forth a bit.   I think he gave me one and I gave him one, too.   We played some good, solid golf.   I think I made three bogeys out there, but complemented that with six birdies.   
    Had a chance on 17 to make a par‑putt there, but it didn't go.   We had a good time going back and forth.   I went on a little bit of a run.   He gave me one of the holes with par, made two birdies, and I think I went four straight holes and it kind of gave me momentum.   Made it a little interesting coming in, got close.   
   
 Q.   That back nine, you were all square.   You got 3‑up, and he closed to within one to a couple of times.   
    RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I had a good stretch, 9, 10, 11 and 12, two birdies in there.   He gave me two with bogeys.   Made some good swings there, so it was nice to put things around.   I was 1‑down.   I was down a little bit early in the match, too.   But he got close coming in, he had some great shots.   It made it interesting, but nice to make birdie on the last to close it out.  
   
 Q.   Tell me about the decision on 16.   You drove the green.   He already hit first, he closed to within 1‑up.   That was really a crucial point in the match because you won the hole?  
    RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, it was.   He had already hung one out right.   It was going to be a tough shot, but still had plenty of green to work with, but depends on the lie.   I was debating between the driver lining up, playing up.   I figured one good swing would take care of it.
