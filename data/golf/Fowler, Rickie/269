Q. PLAYERS champion, Scottish Open champion and now the champion here.  How much energy is left in the tank?  Looking forward to that week off?
RICKIE FOWLER: Definitely looking forward to the week off.  A couple of days where I'll probably not touch a club.  Looking forward to some good times, good practice, and get ready to go to Chicago and get on with The TOUR Championship.
Q. I'm going to ask you a question, that drive down the last, did you mean to thread it right down there that deep down there?  Wow, that was way down there.  You couldn't have placed it better.
RICKIE FOWLER: No, you know, I had a similar situation yesterday.  I hit a good drive and didn't get all the way down to the end.  But didn't really feel like hitting 3-wood.  I felt like driver was going to get me down a ways, 3-wood would leave me back a bit.
Q. Fantastic win.  We'll see you in a couple of weeks' time.  Have a good break.
RICKIE FOWLER: Thank you.
Q. What an afternoon, you and Henrik just going toe-to-toe on those final nine holes until somebody blinked.
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, there wasn't a whole lot -- not many mistakes.  There were some good birdies out there.  Both made some good putts.  16 was tough for Hunter, and that's kind of where the door opened.  I thought I was going to make birdie on 17.  Had a great number coming in on 18.  Left the door open a little bit there.  Just we both happened to not make putts on the last couple of holes.  It was a lot of fun today going against each other.
Q. On 16, how did that look off the tee when it left the club?
RICKIE FOWLER: I knew it was going to be close to the edge, right where the cut is in the fairway, kind of cuts back left there.  I knew it was going to be close.  I knew the back pin wasn't terrible, because it has a good amount of run up there.  And it ended up working out good, and rolled in a good putt there.
