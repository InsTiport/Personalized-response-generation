  Q. Your irons were a little off on distance. Did you feel like you were playing better with them today?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I felt really good. Like I said when I was talking there, I hit some really good putts there at the end and it just didn't go in. Other than that I had a pretty good day. I struggled a little bit coming in and I thought I hit some good shots on 18, and like I said, I hit a good putt and it just didn't go in. I hit some more good shots and good putts on the playoff, but unfortunately made bogey here, and Derek took it.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: It plugged in the bunker, so that was a little unfortunate. I felt like I hit a good shot and then a good putt, and it just hit the lip and came straight out.   
  
  Q. You played phenomenal all day today. What was really working for you out there?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: My speed of putts was really good. I hit some good lag putts and never three-putted, and like I said earlier, I was hitting putts on line, so that's always good when you know where your ball is going to start. I made some good putts for par just to keep the rhythm going and unfortunately missed the last one. It was a fun week, played well, the course was awesome and I just want to thank Nationwide for giving me the opportunity to be out here and playing in the event and Children's Hospital for putting this event on. Awesome week. Definitely a fun week, special.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: No, it's the same. It doesn't matter what you're playing for. If you're playing and you're leading or coming in, I feel the same pressure if it's the U.S. Open or if it's the smallest event we play. You're playing to win. It doesn't matter how big the tournament is, it doesn't matter how much money it is. At the end of the day it's holding the trophy up. So it was a little bit of nerves, but that's why we play, and it felt good. I made some decent shots and made some good recoveries from some places I might have missed. All in all it was a good week.  
  
  Q. When you look at what the second-place finisher would have made, are you wishing you would have turned pro this week?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: No, I'm really looking forward to playing the amateur at Southern Hills which is back close to school, and I'm playing the Walker Cup a couple weeks afterwards playing for the U.S. and hopefully retaining the Cup. That's what I'm looking forward to right now.   
 I'm looking forward to starting off my pro career out here on the Nationwide Tour.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I guess you can look at me like a little bit of an underdog. Fans usually tend to pull for the underdogs, and I felt like I had a good chance, just unfortunately made bogey on the last. Like I said, I hit some good putts on the last few holes.   
 But the fans were awesome. I felt like they root for the amateurs really well and definitely feel welcome out here.   
  
  Q. With what Derek had today did you have a feeling that somebody (indiscernible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Well, the number was out there. He obviously played well. I knew he was going to play well after how well he played yesterday. I thought there was a chance he was going to put up a number. My goal the whole day was to get to 13. A little short, and if I would have gotten to 13 I would have been good.   
  
  Q. Did you ever do that before, and did you know what the ruling was on that?   
 RICKIE FOWLER: No, it happens often, not so much from the fairway on approach shots but for from chips around the green. Yeah, most of the guys should know the rule and I think most everyone does. Just put his ball back since it was already there and left mine and went from there.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Well, it was actually on a little bit different line. I knew it was going to go left. I thought I hit a good putt, I thought I hit it hard enough, and it dove left on me a little bit.   
  
  Q. Is there one area of your game that you feel like you can improve on heading into future tournaments?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I felt like my game was pretty good this week. No, I don't think -- everything can obviously get better. You can never be perfect. I'll keep working on everything and go from there. All in all I felt like I played well. Irons were overall good and putting was really good and I made some good up-and-downs coming in.  
  
  Q. On the 18th green it seemed like a lot of -- you missed left twice and he missed left. Talk about that a little bit.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: It was a little bit tough because you're coming up because the green slopes from back to front and you're coming from the left of the hole and there's a little mound that sneaks the putts left there. It's tough to see the putt going that hard left. I got to see mine from before sneak a little left on a different line, and I saw his which was almost on mine, and mine just broke a little bit more than I thought.
