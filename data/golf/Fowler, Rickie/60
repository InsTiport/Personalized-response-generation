Q. How would you describe that scorecard?
RICKIE FOWLER: Welcome back after a break.  I really haven't played a whole lot of golf.  Done a little bit of work here and there.  Spent a little bit of time in the gym.
For the most part it's been kind of rest up after last season, big finishing stretch, and especially with having the oblique injury; making sure the body was able to recoup after that little stretch after coming back.
So I feel good.  It was nice to get out there and kind of get some of the rust and cobwebs off.  Happy with how we hung in there and finished.  One thing with the altitude and the ball going a little further, kind of try and calculate the wind and everything.  A lot of things going on.  I'm happy with how we finished it up.  Looking forward to hopefully cleaning it up a little bit more tomorrow.
Q. With the wind, it's a half shot tougher with the afternoon tee times.  Does that sound about right?
RICKIE FOWLER: I probably would've said more, yeah.  I mean, I guess when you have roughly 65 guys, 66 on one side of the wave, you may not see a whole lot of movement.
Definitely played tougher in the afternoon, I think.  Seemed like it was fairly calm this morning.  We'll get some calm conditions tomorrow morning.
I don't know if it'll blow as hard as it did today this afternoon for them tomorrow afternoon, but, you know, you get the good side of the wave, the bad side of the wave.  It all even s out through the year, through your career.
Q. With the wind the greens get a little bumpy?
RICKIE FOWLER: That is standard.  When you have 132 players the greens are going to get bumpy back nine in the afternoon.  Those guys will deal with it that played in the morning today.  They'll have tomorrow afternoon.
That's just part of the it.  Like I said, it all evens out.
Q. Rickie, first time in your career with two eagles in a round on tour.  Comment on that and take us through those two holes.
RICKIE FOWLER: Well, two eagles definitely helped.  My goal was to get back to roughly 3-under.  Saw the board and kind of saw where 3-under was and I was like, All right.  At that point we were 1-over.  I was like if we could get four, back to 3-under, that would be a good day.  I really had a chance to do better than that, but definitely pleased with at least kind of reaching my goal of getting to 3-under.
The two eagles, kind of bonuses.  One of them was a long putt, 50-plus feet or so.  The one on 16 we had 7-iron, so kind of a -- I don't want to say it's like making a birdie, but I'll take it coming in as an eagle.
