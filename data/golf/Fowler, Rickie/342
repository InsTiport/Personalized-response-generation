 Q.   How unusual was this day with weather delays and it getting dark?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Kind of just play when you get to play.   It was a little different playing the last few holes in the dark.   I was getting fairly close to calling it obviously but nice to get it in.   I just wish I could have given myself a couple of better looks on the last couple holes.   
Obviously wanted to try and make three at the last.   Tough to see the read.   I thought the hill at first would kick it a bit more right, just didn't do that.   Once it got through that didn't really kill as much speed, ended up a little ways by.  
This is probably the one that hurts the most for me with the majors there year.   The first three were a lot of fun and obviously to be in great positions and to get great finishes.   This one I felt like I could go out today and win it.   I put myself in a good position.   
Like I said, the back nine wasn't what I was wanting.   But still, to look back on the year, it was pretty awesome through the majors and something I can look back on and be proud of.  
   
 Q.   Were you okay with (inaudible)?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   We were cool with hitting the tee shot.   We weren't expecting the approach shots.   Typically if it's getting dark and they are going to below the horn, you at least get the guys off the tee andit gives them the opportunity to play.   We weren't expecting the approach shots.   So however you look at it.   It is what it is.   
Obviously Rory played great this week, and he's been a deserving champion last three tournaments.   He's playing quite good right now.   Best player in the world, hands down.   We'll see if we can sneak one away from him at some point.  
   
 Q.   How does that change the competitive dynamic when you have to watch and wait?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   It changes a little bit.   Obviously there is no waiting, Phil and I waited on the tee for a good amount of time and had to hit tee shots.   In a way they never got out of rhythm as far as hitting the golf shots.   Like I said, I don't think it really changes it much.   
Just we were allowing them to hit the tee shots and then weren't expecting the approach shots to come.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Right now the sting.   Like I said, I really felt like I could win this one.   
Disappointed to come up short, but like I said to look back on the full year and all four majors, definitely something to be proud of.   
   
 Q.   How tough of a spot were you in on 14?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   14 or‑‑ the par‑3?   I got a decent drop and had a decent lie.   I was really trying to play fairly safe and just make I had a roll at 3.   Didn't want to get cute and throw two shots away there.   
I hit a very good putt there as well.   I actually hit good putts all week.   Not very many that I hit off line.   I hit a great putt on 18.   I saw a lot of the hole, and it came out the other side.   
You need those to go in.  
   
 Q.   What happened that tee shot?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   14, par‑3?   Just wasn't fully committed.   Just a little bit of mental error.   Usually I'm not going to make a bad swing if I'm committed and know exactly what I'm doing.   
Just probably a little bit of second guess, kind of thew out the process of setting up to the shot and doing the swing.  
   
 Q.   Does it feel stunning right now or does it feel emotional?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   It was definitely emotional as soon as I finished up as far as I really felt like I could win today and to come up a bit short and obviously not to make birdie on the last at least, obviously I wanted to make 3 there, but disappointed right now.   
But like I said, once I will be able to look back at all four majors and it's something I'll definitely to be proud of.  
   
 Q.   Is there one shot that you would like to have back?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Maybe the 9‑iron on 17 out of the fairway.   I had a good number and just didn't catch it clean and left it out to the right.   
I had a good number to the left pin and I'm able to be aggressive with it, I make birdie there and have a chance to make 3 or 4 at the last.   It's a different story.   That was kind of a knot the best swing at the wrong time.  
   
 Q.   I know your head is (inaudible)?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   We'll see.   We played in 2010 as teammates and we did okay.   Obviously as a team, we didn't go great that year.   We lost.   Phil and I have a good time together.   If Keegan ends up earning a pick, he's done well with Phil.   I'm pretty open to play with anyone.   I'm pretty easy going.   It's obviously an honor to be on the team, but it will be interesting to see.   
After this week I know Phil earns his way in and with the picks, like I said, I'm happy to play with anyone.   If it's Phil, we'll go out and do our best to get a point.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I mean, it was a little different than a normal finish.   Just being in the position and actually around the lead versus trying to come from behind at the past majors.   I felt really good.   I felt like I could really win today.   Obviously I was going to have to make three at the last to have any sort of chance.   I made some good swings and I'm pleased with the swings that I did make on 18 with the driver and the 4‑iron in.
