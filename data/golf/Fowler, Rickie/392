  RICKIE FOWLER:   My third year here, so first year I had my grandpa on the bag.   He's the one that got me into golf.   And then I had my dad last year.   Topped it off this year with my grandma, so knocking them off down the family.  
   
 Q.   How did she do?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   She did great.   I think she's actually supposed to have knee surgery at some point coming up, but all of a sudden her knee felt pretty good today.  
   
 Q.   She said you lined her up wrong on the last hole?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I gave her a bad read.   I was hoping she would make that.   It would have been fun to see.   
   
 Q.   Did she give you any tips out there?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   What's that?   
   
 Q.   Did she give you any tips out there?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   She kept me calm.   She was good.   She did a good job on the back.   We had fun.   The Parâ€‘3 Contest is a good time.   A Wednesday afternoon around Augusta is pretty special.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever played together before, you and your grandma?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, a little bit.   They live in Utah.   My grandpa got me into the game.   My grandma plays a little bit.   So I played with them quite a bit.  
   
 Q.   She doesn't outdrive you, right?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   No, no.   I still sneak it out there past her.
