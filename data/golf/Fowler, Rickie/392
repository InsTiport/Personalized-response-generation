Q.   Three birdies and one bogey, how do you feel about your start? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Pretty good.   Played pretty solid for the most part.   A couple bad swings coming in but nothing really to worry about.   I hit some good putts out there, good up‑and‑downs, drove the ball fairly well, so looking forward to getting after it tomorrow.

Q.   You've been playing some really good golf since we got back to the East Coast.   What's it going to take to get back into the winner's circle again?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Consistency.   Like I said I made a few bad swings coming in and hopefully that will be kind of the last of them for the week, get out to some good starts for the rest of the rounds, and definitely want to be back in contention; close last week, had a chance with it but looking forward to playing well here at Doral.

Q.   Changing gears a little bit, I saw the second video for the 'Golf Boys', how much fun do you have making those videos? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's a lot of fun.   Pretty busy couple days.   We try to get that filming into two days, it's pretty tough.   Busy, but walk away pretty exhausted, but having a great time with a good group of guys.

Q.   Got to be a lot of behind the scenes things that we'll never hear about. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Probably there's some.   I might have a couple pictures of some fun stuff.   But nothing too crazy.   Like I say, it's fun getting a group of guys like that together and ultimately being able to do something like that that's fun for charity.
