 Q.  What does a day like today do with your brain?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I mean, the hard part, it's tough to get into a rhythm, obviously.  Probably about as easy as the course was going to play this morning when we went out.  We didn't have a whole lot of wind, soft conditions.   
And then second time going out, we didn't get to hit any balls.  I know we had an hour 10, hour 15 minute delay.  So tough to come right back out there.  Wind started to pick up.   
I mean, No. 12, I hit 3 wood, 5 iron, 4 iron.  So that makes the par 5 fairly tough.  Yeah, just tough to get into a rhythm.  Still driving the fairway.  The course was playable with the softer greens, but I struggle with that.  So it was a bit of a long day.   
 Q.  Do you ever get used to popping out, coming back, warming up.  Are you used to it?  
RICKIE FOWLER: We're used to it in a way because it happens.  Especially during the summer months, it happens on tour.  You just basically play when you get to play.   
 Q.  Thoughts on your round?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Not the start I wanted, that's for sure.  But I'll go get a little bit of rest, come back out early, and see if we can get some back coming in.  I have a par putt on 13.  It would be nice to roll that in and kind of get a couple things going, make a couple birdies coming in.   
 Q.  It's supposed to clear up.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it's supposed to be clear the next three days.
