Q. Jason Dufner gave you one heck of a test, and actually won his match.  Talk about the ebb and flow in that match.  How would you describe it?
RICKIE FOWLER: We had a good time.  It's always fun playing with Duf.  And unfortunately we had to face each other so early.  It was a good match out there.  Duf played well.  I felt like he brought his game out today, gave me a couple of holes, nice of him letting me back in.  Made some birdies out there to kind of hang around and get myself back in the match.  But he made some good birdies on 16 and 17 to close out the match.  He made more putts than I did today and that was probably the little bit of difference.
Q. Now you're 0-1in match play.  Does that shift your mentality, your aggressiveness, your anything, heading into the second match tomorrow?
RICKIE FOWLER: Not really.  Going into each match, you obviously play to win.  Now a little behind, I've got to win the next two.  Just go one match at a time.  Did my best out there today, tried to fight through it.  At least I got myself back in the match, but couldn't finish it off.  So looking forward to tomorrow.  I feel like I've been swinging well, just need to make some more birdies.
