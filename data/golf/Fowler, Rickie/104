 Q.  You had all these responsibilities coming into this week, where was it, how high up on your responsibility list was getting your game back on track to where you wanted it to get to and are you happy through the first two rounds?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I'm very happy.  It was great having Claude here to help out the first couple days to continue what we have been working on to try and dial that in.  Yeah, as far as the responsibilities go, it's been fun being able to be here and represent Arnie and be one of the hosts.  I would say at the end of the day golf is kind of the main priority and obviously trying to get the game going and that's a big part of why we're all here.  I would say receiving the award on Wednesday, that's definitely the highlight of the week I think regardless of how we play.  I think that receiving that award from the family, being recognized as the family seeing me as someone they see a lot of Arnie in, it's hard to describe what that means.  So to get that and see the response from everyone, that's been pretty cool.   
 Q.  What was, what did you and Claude work on specifically?  Was there something specific?  
RICKIE FOWLER: There's a lot of things, I'm pretty messed up.  It's always, everything goes back to really the first half of the swing, the take away to the top of the swing, getting the club in the proper position at the top kind of allows me to have full control through the rest of the swing.  So if it doesn't start off right, then we're just trying to play catch up.  So big thing is getting the club in the right spot at the top and then really been working on releasing the club properly through impact.  So when I'm hitting a draw I have to feel like my glove is almost trying to face the ground through impact with my left hand.  So which feels really awkward when you got trouble both ways.  It's scary at times.   
 Q.  Rory said it cost Tiger half a shot every round, but Jason Day said this week that, no, it's the opposite, it costs the other guys playing with him, costs them the shots.  Where are you standing on that one?  
RICKIE FOWLER: As far as what?   
 Q.  When you play with Tiger, the craziness around Tiger, when you're with him, Rory was like, I need an Advil, I have a headache, and it cost him half a shot.  Jason was like, no, actually it benefits him.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Well he's used to it.  He's been around it.  I mean it's nothing new to him.  So the more and more you play in front of big crowds or loud crowds or cameras going off and whatnot, I mean to think how I feel say on 16 at Phoenix now versus the first year or two I played there, I used to have to play some the ball to go a little further, adrenaline's going, your senses are kind of heightened, now it's like a comfort zone in there because we have been there so much.  Yeah, I would agree.  I mean I'm sure there's times where it can work against Tiger, maybe earlier in the week, Thursday, Fridays, when the people are just there around him on the weekend it's probably more beneficial where he can, like I said, he's used to it.
