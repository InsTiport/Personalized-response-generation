 Q.  Today you went on a little birdie run, 13, 14, 15, 16, thought you eagled 18.  That was pretty good.  You got hot on the back nine, didn't you?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, made a couple good swings.  Yeah, finally got a couple putts to go in.  I thought I made the one on 17, same with 18.  So nice to kind of finish strong and finish off the week well.   
 Q.  We talked about it the other day, it really looks like your game is rounding into great form heading into the season.  You got to be excited.  
RICKIE FOWLER: I am.  I was a little disappointed, I actually got a bit of a fever yesterday, so I was huffing and puffing a little bit out there today.  So I fought through it and was proud of myself for getting the most out of the round today.   
The game has felt really, really good.  Looking forward to getting over to Abu Dhabi and a little bit of the West Coast Swing and ultimately getting ready for Augusta.   
 Q.  Yesterday you were joking around about Jordan.  The only way to stop him is for a thunderstorm or something to come through today.  How do you describe the way he's playing right now?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Well, obviously he went out and gave himself a good little cushion.  And then on top of that he just continued to play well.  He hasn't given anyone opportunities to really catch up.  So, it's just solid golf and I think you're going to see a lot of that like he did last year.  You're going to have to play a good solid golf tournament to have a chance to win.   
 Q.  Your galleries are growing.  You can see it every where you go.  When are the folks in the States going to see you again?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Next I'll be there is I'll be home, Torrey Pines for Farmers Insurance Open.  So really looking forward to being there, got a lot of friends and family that come out there, so that's obviously a fun week for me.   
 Q.  I thought that was fun walking down 18, they introduced you and you gave them a little hang ten sign.  That was a nice thing that got the crowd going.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, you got to give them the local shaka.  I learned from some of my boys that are locals over here.  So do it the right way.
