 Q. Well, it's a lock. Got a full-time job for next year just as you're heading into the off season. That's gotta make you feel good. What are you going to work on, what are you not going to work on, and kind of moving forward?
 RICKIE FOWLER: I gotta work on my putting, you know. Finished again top 10 in greens in regulation and yet another 40 played center, so it's been a long year, you know. Obviously fortunate enough to keep my card, but still got a lot of work to do. 
 I feel like I'm hitting the ball good, so I guess if you hit the ball -- or if you putt that bad during the year and you still keep your card, I guess we'll take it. 

 Q. Will you do a lot in the off season?
 RICKIE FOWLER: I'll keep fresh. I gotta get off. I'll probably take a couple weeks off. Lay my head down. This year's been pretty eventful and stressful. But let my hair down a little bit, have some fun with the boys, but still play some casual golf.
