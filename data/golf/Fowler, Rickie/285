  RICKIE FOWLER: Coming over here the week before The Open, coming here to try to prepare and get the game ready, and get in contention and get ready for next week; and ultimately, what I wanted to do was be here in contention and have a chance to win.  So we did just that. So a successful week.  Felt really good coming down the stretch.  It was nice to be back in contention after The Players win.  Excited where the game is at.  Have a few things we need to straighten out before Thursday but excited about next week.   Q.  Is it all the more special to win on a links course in the Home of Golf, as well?  RICKIE FOWLER: It is.  Really the only thing that can get a little more special than this would be winning next week at the Home of Golf.  But winning on a links golf course in the home of Scotland, the Home of Golf, it is a special week. Beat some pretty good players out there today.  The guys were on top of their games.  I didn't see many scores being under par with the way the wind was blowing and it because going to be a tough test of golf.  Definitely proud of how I finished.   Q.  Talk me through 18.  That's a finish deserving to be proud of.  RICKIE FOWLER: Joe, my caddie, was telling me I had options off the tee, whether it was driver, 3-wood.  I think he was feeling a little more comfortable with 3-wood.  I felt that I was going to make a better swing with driver.  Knew I had to just fit it between the two bunkers.  Hit a great drive, had a good number with sand wedge there and just had to take a little off it.  Nice to get it in there where it was close enough range where I didn't have to think too much about it.   Q.  I take it excitement was already high ahead of next week, but to know you're going in there as a champion?  RICKIE FOWLER: It is special, and going to St. Andrews where I've had some success, really looking forward to getting back over there and getting reacquainted with the golf course.  Like I said, just fine-tuning the game a little bit and getting ready to go for there.
