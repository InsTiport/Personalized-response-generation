 Q.   How would you assess the day for you today?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Scramble.   I didn't drive it particularly well.   And obviously made things a little bit tougher, score from there, and put a lot of stress on the rest of the game.   It was nice to hit some better drives coming in.   I managed myself to keep from having to hit some balls after the round.   
I'm excited to get back on the course tomorrow and see if we can get things going.  
   
 Q.   Guys talking about pin placements, they were hard, like Sunday pin placements.   Did you feel that way?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   They had a couple of pins that were pretty tucked.   There were a lot of hard pins out here.   The wind was up a little bit to the early part and middle of the round, so that made judging distances a little bit tougher.  
The greens are probably a little on the slower side than normal, so with some tougher pins you could still be above the hole and be okay.  
But it didn't play easy out there.   I made it a little tougher playing in the trees.   So we'll try and stay away from there tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   How much were you leaderboard watching to see what Jordan was doing?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I'm always interested to see what everyone was doing.   And obviously being the last group off, you see what guys are doing in the morning, a handful of guys that are finished before I'm even warming up.   So you kind of get a sense of how the course is playing.   And I was excited to get out there.   
I got off to a great start and unfortunately just‑‑ you can miss fairways, you just can't be behind or up against trees, and unfortunately that's where I was.  
   
 Q.   It's been a long day for you.   I saw you out here at 7:30 this morning, with the Big Three thing.   What made you come out so early when you were the last tee time out?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I've never done it before, I'd never seen the honorary group tee off.   And I thought it was the right time to do it.   I just wanted to see it.   I know Arnold, you never know how much longer he'll go, to step up and tee it up on the first hole.   I didn't want to miss that.   And it's good to know the three of them and really call them friends.   It was fun to be here this morning.   It was very special.   I went back, took a nap and went through the normal warm up.   
   
 Q.   What do you take away from today and would like to do tomorrow?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Stay out of the trees.   Got my driver straightened out there on the back nine.   So just drive it better tomorrow and free up the rest of my game.   I'm swinging well.   I'm hitting my irons well.   And hitting a lot of good putts.   So put the ball in the fairway would make things a lot easier.
