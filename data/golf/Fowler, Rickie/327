Q. Just first off, they just spread it out.  Was there any way you thought you would catch them before the turn?JIMMY WALKER: You've got think you could catch them.  We kept trying to hit good shots, just missed a couple of putts that we needed to make to give ourselves more of a chance.  They played solid.  They didn't make any bogeys and we made a few.Q. They executed it well all day?JIMMY WALKER: They hit the ball good, kept the ball in front of them, just didn't make any mistakes.  We made a few, and so it was tough to come back.Q. Tomorrow will be the big battle, but it's still there?JIMMY WALKER: Yes, it is.  I like our squad.  I like our guys.  I've got faith in all of us.Q. Hard to catch them when they spread it out so well?  Before the turn it was looking rough?RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, yeah, obviously we wanted to get off to a better start today, unfortunately weren't able to do that.  They got off to a good start.  Take the both sides of that and there is the gap. We tried to push them as far as we could, but they played great today and made it tough for us to make a comeback.Q. You have been a GOOD team by yourselves all week, but one or two things just tip it the other way?RICKIE FOWLER: Alternate shot is tough.  Like Jimmy said, we made a few mistakes, and they didn't really make any.  It's tough to beat guys when they play well.Q. With Captain Watson and all the guys together, you know it can be done tomorrow based on history.  Deficits don't mean much when you're playing well?JIMMY WALKER: We have got guys that are playing well individually, and just unfortunately that obviously the Europeans have played well in the afternoon session.  It's really just positioning the first two days for singles.  We're in a tough position, but I feel like we can dig ourselves out of the hole
