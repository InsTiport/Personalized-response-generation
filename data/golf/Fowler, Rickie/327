 Q.  You knew it was going to be tough playing against the No. 1 player in the world and probably going to be the Player of the Year.  When you started out 3-under, 3-2, tough hole to climb out of?  RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, like you said, 3-under through 2, but you can also add 5-under through 6. Obviously he came out swinging.  He played well early, then obviously I had some chances with some birdies to get back at him.  I had it back to 4 and then made a couple of birdies and he made some putts on top of me.  Not a whole lot I got back from him.   Q.  Do you try to do anything differently, you've got to climb out of that hole, do you take any chances or risks?  RICKIE FOWLER: Not too much, not until you are really pressing at the end.  When you are down that much early, try to stick to the game plan and keep executing and hitting good shots. I felt like I got some things going, like I said, it was just you never really opened any doors for me.  He took care of business today and he played really well.   Q.  Second Ryder Cup, what are you taking from the experience?  RICKIE FOWLER: They are weeks that I don't want to miss, win or lose.  The time that you get to spend with 11 other guys on the team and the captains, it's a special week.  It would be nice to get a win one day soon.  It's a special week
