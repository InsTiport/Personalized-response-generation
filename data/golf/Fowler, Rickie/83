 Q.  Share your thoughts from today with us, please.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Got off to a nice start, but I just didn't execute through the middle of the round.  Obviously disappointed.  Obviously wanted to take care of -- you know, head in the right direction today, but didn't do that.  Back to the drawing board.  We'll come out hot tomorrow and see what we can do.   
 Q.  Any positives for a new day tomorrow?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, made some good swings coming in, but like I said, just didn't execute through the middle of the front nine through the middle of the round and obviously cost me, falling back a bit.  We'll be in a good spot for tomorrow and ready to go.
