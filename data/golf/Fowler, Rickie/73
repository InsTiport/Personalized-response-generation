 Q.  No one likes to finish with a bogey.  Another 5-under par, 65.  Did the weather change when you guys made the turn from the front to the back?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Today was nice.  It would have been nice to get a couple more and not make bogey at the last.  Puts me into good spot for tomorrow.  At least took care of most of the stuff we wanted to or needed to today.   
Got a little tougher on the back-9, the wind definitely picked up.  Feels like it was pretty much out of the same direction most of the day but probably cooled off a little bit and few miles an hour quicker which made a few of the final holes playing back into the wind tough to hit your numbers and -- but we did a good job today and put ourself in good position for Sunday.   
 Q.  Even with the two and a half inches of rain we had last night and this morning, how different did the course play?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Quite a bit.  It's soft out there and we were ball in hand in the fairways so -- which was definitely needed.  It was pretty wet out there and the only problem is we're expected to get more rain tomorrow so it's very soft out there.   
Obviously you could see the greens were very receptive, hitting a lot of three-quarter shots into back pins to try and get keep the ball from coming back at all and looks like we might have an inch or two on the way tomorrow.   
 Q.  Great start.  Certainly an opportunity tomorrow.  Probably could be a long day.  Get some rest tonight.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Could be some delays but I know there's not any electricity, just water-dependent.  We'll get rest and come out ready to tee it up.
