 Q. Rickie, no one likes to end with a bogey, but a one-putt bogey on the 9th, not too bad. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: A good bogey. Yeah, I saved two shots there at the end. Made a good up-and-down on 8 and ended up making a really good putt for bogey there on 9. 
 Unfortunately, my elbow popped on my back swing on the first swing and the 6-iron stuck in the ground. Not much I can do about that. But still a finish with a nice putt.

 Q. No problem with the elbow for the future? 
 RICKIE FOWLER: No, no. Every once in a while it will tighten it up and I have to pop it. It's like popping a knuckle or something like that.

 Q. You tee off on the 10th, rip off three birdies and then you get to the 15th. How difficult is that hole playing these days? 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Well, yesterday I hit driver, 9-iron in the Pro-Am. But it was blowing about 25 downwind. Today it was blowing 15 into our face. So I actually hit driver, hybrid and came up a little bit short. 
 So actually I hit a really good putt for par there, but a tough hole for the day. I walked away with a bogey. But I felt like I was swinging really good today, especially after last week. I struggled a little bit.

 Q. You have a quick tempo on your swing. Does that help you or hurt you in New Orleans? 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Well, if I go ahead and hit full shots, it's tough for me to control the ball. With the quick tempo that I do have, I like to hit a lot of three-quarter shots which helps slow me down, slows the swing down a little bit and hit the ball better.
