 Q.  How excited are you?  
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I'm very excited.  We practised together the last three days.  We're good buddies and we always spend a lot of time at home or even on the road.  So we know each other pretty well.   
I think we're definitely excited about playing with each other.  I think our games match up very well.  We're both -- you know, I feel like we both do everything very well.  He's a great player, and I'm definitely excited to be his partner.   
RICKIE FOWLER: Looking forward to it.  I feel like getting matched up against Rory and a lot of the team matches, I've played against him plenty and played with ThorbjÃ¸rn quite a bit, just played with him at The Open not too long ago.  Two great ball-strikers.  Rory, obviously one of the best players in the game.   
So I'm confident in my partner going head-to-head with those guys.  We're going to have a good time out there, and I think there's going to be a lot of good golf.  It's going to be a hard-fought match.
