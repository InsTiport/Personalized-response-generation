 Q.   General comments about your round.   Good finish.   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, got off to a bit of a slow start, but made a nice eagle on 8.   That kind of got things jump started.   
I played a little bit better than yesterday.   Hit a lot more greens.   So a little less stressful.   But, no, go get a few things straightened out on the range and see if we can make a run tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   What did you have on 8?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I hit driver, 3‑wood.   I think it was 259, unadjusted, and then it plays a little uphill.   I hit it to about three feet.   Nice way to do it.   
   
 Q.   Three holes this week really kind of cost you, the double and the triple.   Obviously it's frustrating.   Can I get your thoughts about that.   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, first hole of the week, I was under a tree and had to hit a punch shot, ended up over the green to a back pin, which is a place you can't hit it.   So I was playing for five.   Ended up hitting a poor chip.   So I make six there.   
You can end up in some funky spots around here.   
10, I just made a bad swing, ended up making a good six after taking an unplayable.   
The only one I can really, that was maybe a little lack of commitment on a shot was 16.   It was just, I didn't hit it hard enough.   I was hitting, I was taking just a little bit off of a 6‑iron and I took a little too much off.   So I went swimming and I made six.  
   
 Q.   I don't know if it's aggressiveness or just golf or what, but you seem to have some of these doubles and things, it's obviously frustrating, anything you can pinpoint it to?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   No.   For the most part golf, it's just golf, a bad swing at the wrong time.   Put yourself in a tough position.   Penalty shots definitely don't help trying to make par.   It makes that a little bit tough.  
   
 Q.   How did you find the conditions out there today?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Played a little tougher today.   Greens are a bit firmer.   Speed‑wise they're fairly similar to where they have been, but definitely played a little bit tougher out there, so definitely happy with where I ended up and looking forward to tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   A couple years ago, the rulings, maybe sort of not disqualifying the player depending upon the situation, if there's a rule violation found out after the round.   That came into play today with Tiger.   Are you in favor of that rule of something you didn't know you did and it comes to light and you don't want to sign for a wrong scorecard and you are disqualified?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, yeah, if it's something that I didn't know that I had did wrong and maybe there's a viewer through a TV that calls in, it's kind of a tough position to be in.   I know that everyone looked at it prior to him moving on and everything was looked at and okay, so in a way the rules officials have that say.   So I think that it's just, there's a gray area there.   Hopefully I never have to deal with it.  
   
 Q.   You've had some success in your time coming out to the TOUR.   What do you make of Guan and him making the cut and his performance today?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's awesome.   I heard leading up to the week that he didn't hit it very far.   I mean, obviously at 14 you're not expected to hit it with Bubba or anything.   So I know he was kind of at a disadvantage on distance and stuff like that, so for him to go out and shoot the scores that he did is pretty impressive.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I'm close.   Excited with where I'm at.   Bay Hill was the first week I've played since last June off medication.   So, yeah, I'm excited with where my game's at and moving forward health‑wise, just kind of getting back into the swing of things with my swing and getting things straightened out, just because I've been swinging injured in a way, having to work around that and now I'm able to kind of do my own thing and not have to worry about that.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about this week that makes you feel you're closer to winning a Major?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Where my game was and playing good at Bay Hill and then just being comfortable coming back here, being my third year, I feel I've had enough rounds around here to know my way around a little bit and I keep getting more and more comfortable going into each Major.
