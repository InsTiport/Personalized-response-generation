  Q. Are you expecting anything different on the weekend?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Well, it's obviously a wide-open tournament. It's pretty tightly packed, and for the most part you make the cut and you're going to have a chance. Just go out and play well this weekend. So it's basically a new tournament starting tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Did you hear the forecast for tomorrow?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Last I checked I knew it was supposed to rain and not be very good. It's not going to be like it was today.  
  
  Q. Are you okay with that?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: It's obviously going to play tough, but everyone is going to have to play in it, so just kind of have to embrace it and try and go in with a good attitude and try to play as well as we can.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I made probably my worst swings I have all week the last five holes and I played them 1-under somehow. So getting those out felt good, but the game does feel really good. I love playing links golf because you can do so much with your golf game and hit so many different shots. It's fun playing over here.   
 Like I said, I got some bad swings out of the way, but other than that I've hit a lot of good shots this week, hit a lot of good putts. I got one to drop at 15 but hopefully we can get some more the next couple days.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Links golf definitely gives you room to recover. Obviously there's not really thick rough where you're chipping out. Obviously you hit in a bunker for the most part you're going to be chopping out. So it gives you some options where you can run it around, get it up close, have a chance to make par, and that's the fun of it. You can hit so many different shots. You can be in trouble and chase something up, have a 100-foot putt, get down in two and you walk away with a par. That's just how it is.  
  
  Q. Talk about the shot on 17.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I didn't have a great lie in the rough off the tee. I pulled my drive a little bit, wasn't too far off, and then for the most part you're just trying to chip something up there and chase it on the green and have a look for birdie. I hit a 6-iron.  
  
  Q. What did you have?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Around 170 or so. It only flew 125 or 130.  
  
  Q. Was it tougher today than yesterday?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I think it played fairly similar. It was tough seeing -- we got the harder side of the wave with the breeze, but it's fun playing links golf in wind because obviously it brings out the character in the course. But onto the weekend, and that's the first goal out of the way. But I think it played pretty similar both days.   
  
  Q. Talk about Peter's game.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Peter is good at controlling his ball flight and he's got a good short game. If you can control your golf ball and put yourself in position where you're going to be able to make a couple birdies -- Peter can hit it long, he can hit it high if he needs to, but he has control of his golf ball, so I think that's why he can play well and likes to play links golf.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I think at times you have to hit a certain shot or play something on the ground. You have to be able to control your golf ball. So it's not always calling for the stock driving-range shot. Being able to have an imagination or be able to kind of see different shots definitely helps with links golf.
