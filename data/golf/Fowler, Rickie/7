Q. Rickie, a surreal day gets even more so with the news that Masters postponed. What's your reaction to the last 18 hours?
RICKIE FOWLER: To me it almost seemed like it was just inevitable as far as where things were heading across our country in sports and through different organizations and things like that. You know, I stick by the TOUR and Jay and everyone's decision to obviously move forward with what everyone else is doing, as well. And the Masters being postponed, not, obviously, canceled or pushed back yet. But it's all about the safety and wellness of our country and all the people.
We'll go home and relax a little bit, take this as a little bit of a mini-off-season in a way. But yeah, the biggest thing is obviously we don't want this to turn into something bigger than what it is and what it can be.
Q. How do you come to grips with it as a golfer, as a husband, and as a human being in the world and this changing reality?
RICKIE FOWLER: Well, actually -- and I saw some stuff that J. T. said. I mean, it's just golf. It's just a game that we get to play, which is pretty special. But outside of golf and sports and stuff like that, life is a lot bigger than sports and golf. So to have some tournaments canceled or postponed, it is what it is. There's a lot bigger things than us and golf. It's about everyone being healthy and in a good place.
