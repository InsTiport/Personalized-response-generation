  RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I mean, there is obviously tradition and stuff that's always going to be in place as far as the two teams getting together and having the dinner and stuff like that.
But I know this year some of the obligations were limited because I know Captain Watson wanted it to be a little bit more, you know, not as much stuff at night and kind of go play.
Not that that worked or didn't work.   If we would've played better, would've been fine. 

Q.   Did it surprise you that they're going to form a Task Force? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yes and no.   It was cool to get the call to be on it, that's for sure. 

Q.   Yes. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   So I'm going to know a lot more after the first meeting as far as what's going on and being around all these guys.   I don't think I've ever been to a golf meeting before, so new to me. 

Q.   New to everybody, I suppose, on the Task Force. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah. 

Q.   Someone was saying the other day said, probably Tiger said it, that hopefully this is just one Task Force, just one meeting, and they'll have the metrics to go forward. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   It could be that way.   Could be two, three meetings.   Don't really know.   Kind of just looking forward to the first one and everyone getting together and kind of go from there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, Dimeglio had a survey going around.   One was about Bubba and Augusta and how many I thought he would win.
He's 36 now.   I felt like he could get two more.   The place is perfect for him as far as being able to shape shots and his imagination. 
JOHN BUSH:   Comment on your day.   Great start.
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, a little up and down early, and played a good, solid back nine.   Nice start to the event.
JOHN BUSH:   Tough golf course.
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah.   I mean, it is a tough golf course if you put yourself in the wrong position.   Today the wind kind of laid down a little bit towards the second half.
Jordan got off to a good start it looked like.   It wasn't playing easy early on.   Definitely some tough holes out here.   Looks like he took advantage of getting some on those holes and some of the easier ones.
I'm definitely happy with the start. 

Q.   Do you have much experience on this golf course?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I've probably played between 1520 rounds here many.   Played two college events and Tavistock here.

Q.   Best birdie today? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Best birdie?   No. 11 was kind of nice.   Got me going on the back nine.   Hit a 7â€‘iron in there to about three feet.

Q.   (No microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER:   I don't know.   I had a couple good rounds, but I don't think I had a great finish.
