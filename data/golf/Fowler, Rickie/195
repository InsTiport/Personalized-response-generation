RICKIE FOWLER: Made a couple good putts on top for par which is something I've struggled with the last few months.  Nice to see some progress there.  If I can make some putts over the weekends, continue to swing well, but off to a good start after the first two days.   
 Q.  What's the whole deal with you and Justin Thomas, seems to be working, the playoff mustache.  How did that get started?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Justin, he thought of it -- I said, yeah, sure, let's go.  Let's have some fun.  Something different.  Trying to get some MoJo going in the Playoffs.  Him and I been playing well but not as well as we would like to.  Just something to kind of goof around.  We enjoy having a good time off the golf course and on.  Kind of a way of just trying to lighten it up.   
 Q.  Who is winning?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I have to believe that -- I have confidence in myself and my mustache.
