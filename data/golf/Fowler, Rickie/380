 Q.   Tough finish to a pretty good day there for you?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, probably about as bad as I could score out there today.   Felt like I was swinging it well.   Hit some good putts that didn't go in and little bit of tough way to finish, but definitely draw on the positive.   
Swung really well today and was very consistent.   Just missed a few greens at the end, but all in all off to a decent start.   Could have been better, but the course looks like it's pretty good out there.   It's playable.   If the ball striking is good, you can score.  
   
 Q.   Did the rain this morning change the way the course played at all?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Not much.   I did soften it up a little bit, made some pins a little more assessable, some of the front pins.   The rough wasn't as bad as I was expecting     with it possibly being wet.   
There was some spots that I got a tough lie on the last hole and then compounded it, made a double there.   But definitely playable.  
It looks like a good setup and just unfortunately I couldn't get more out of it.
