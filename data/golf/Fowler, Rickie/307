 Q.   How would you sum up the golf course?   There seemed to be a lot of birdies out there today.   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, there are.   There's some hole locations that you're able to get the ball close.   
   
 Q.   Any in particular?   Like on the front side especially?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   2's always a hole that you look to birdie.   
3 is a good one to hit driver up there and get a short little pitch shot in.   
6.   
8, you always look at as a possible good birdie there.   
9's in a tough spot.   
But really just driving the ball in the fairway gives you the opportunity to be aggressive on a couple pins.   
Then taking advantage of the par‑5s when you can.  
   
 Q.   So when you woke up and heard rain, what was your ‑‑  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I don't think I was up that early.   
   
 Q.   You were up that early on Thursday and you didn't tee off until 2:00.   
RICKIE FOWLER:   No, I knew the rain was coming last night and I knew it would go through the night.   
I knew that the course wouldn't really soften up too much.   They do a good job of keeping this place pretty dry.  
   
 Q.   How far off the lead do you expect to be by day's end, given what you've seen out there?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Really don't know.   I can't really judge on how Jordan's feeling or what he's going to do today.   
There's a chance that I won't be as far back as I was starting the day, but there's also a chance that I could be a little ways, a little further back.   So, no telling.  
   
 Q.   Did you see Tiger's name climbing up the scoreboard and what was your reaction?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I saw he decided to pitch in a couple birdies there to start out.   So good it to see him get things going.   Obviously, he's got plenty of good memories around here, so there's ‑‑ he doesn't lack being able to pull on past experiences and good shots and making putts around here.   
So, it's good to see him back up there, see if we can ‑‑ might be kind of chasing him down‑‑ Jordan's so far out front, we might be chasing a couple of those guys down around 5‑ through 8‑under.  
   
 Q.   It looked like your round was a continuation of how you finished yesterday.   Is that accurate or fair?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I finished well yesterday and then got out there and kind of picked up where I left off.   Unfortunately, I didn't play the last six holes like I did yesterday.   So there was those good 18 holes in there somewhere.  
   
 Q.   What would you say went wrong the last six holes?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I didn't take advantage of the par‑5s.   Actually hit a good shot into 13, it just drifted a little further left.   It actually hung up on the fringe where it normally doesn't and had an awkward putt, down and up.   
Hit a good second putt on 15, just didn't break.   Kind of went through a flat spot or something.   
14, I caught a little bit of a flier out of the cut of rough.   
So those three holes I gave away three shots and really didn't hit a poor shot.   
   
 Q.   Going into the final round do you think you can realistically continue your streak of Top‑5's in the Majors?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, going into the last six today I felt like I was in a good position to get a good solid round, whether I got the par‑5s or not.   I wasn't really expecting to make any bogeys or anything coming in.   But I was hoping to get to at least 5‑ today, maybe 6‑, and post a score and be able to go out tomorrow and have a chance of getting a really good finish here.  
Now I'm going to need to put a good round together tomorrow to have a chance to finish in the top‑10 and it's going to have to be a really good one to get to the top‑5.   It's not out of the question, but we'll see what we can do.
