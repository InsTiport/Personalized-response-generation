RICKIE FOWLER: It's always right to get going in the right direction in the first round.  Happy with it.  I hit a lot of good putts, a lot of good shots out there.  One swing that cost me a couple of shots on 17.   
But other than that I felt like we did a good job of moving forward.  We can tighten up the scrambling short game a little bit.  Other than that I think we did a good job of getting out to a good start and taking care of the first day.   
 Q.  How much did the weather play into it today?  
RICKIE FOWLER: The weather was off and on.  Just really depended on where you were at, which hole you were on.  Guys were going to get it at different points on the golf course.  But it was nice that the rain didn't decide to stick around.  It would just be a few minutes, kind of run through and be gone.  There were a couple of points where it came down pretty good.  Other than that it was just kind of spotty throughout the day.  And I think we managed to get a decent day weather-wise of what it could have been.
