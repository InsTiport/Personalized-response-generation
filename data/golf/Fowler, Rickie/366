Q.   Could you believe he was offering you the half? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   No, I had to kind of find out what he was asking or offering there.   Took me a few to kind of realize.   And obviously I'd be stupid to not take a half.   I was outside of him.   He had a good look for par.   He had the advantage there.   Anything could have happened.   I was ready to make the putt, put the pressure on him. 
He made a good birdie on 8 to go 3â€‘up.   I knew I had my work cut out for me.   And I gave it the best fight I could.
