Q. How would you characterize your round?
RICKIE FOWLER: Got off to a nice start the first two holes.  Needed a couple more on the front-9 (inaudible).
Had a couple looks to start the back-9 and on 11 and didn't get that to go and then started to make a couple late.  Everything was a solid day.  Nice to give Marc a little bit of a push but he did a great job out there playing in control and he made that cushion where he allowed himself to make mistakes but when he did make a bad swing or mistake did a good job rebounding.
I think he made really just that one bogey on the front and come back a little but rebounded quickly and one bogey on the back.  Stepped up and made some birdies coming in.  Tough to catch him.
Q. Playing at such a high level since the U.S. Open, 6th Top-10 in 9 starts.  What did you learn from your game this week?
RICKIE FOWLER: It would have been nice not to have some 3-putts.  That was a bit of a downer.  Outside of that I think we hit a lot of good putts, made some good putts.
I chipped a lot better this week than the last couple, the ones where I didn't finish in the Top-10.
I feel like the rest of the game is right there.  The short game is not there.  It's a struggle sometimes to hang around the top.  So, no, it's been a fun year.  I'm looking forward to next week.  I think it will all come together at the right time.
Q. Marc doesn't get a ton of acclaim.  Obviously his game is pretty tight.
RICKIE FOWLER: Marc's a world class player now.  He's got the power, he hits it plenty far.  He made plenty of big putts today especially coming down the stretch, made some good swings.  He's definitely not someone that you look past.  I think maybe that's been the case in the past but I know us as players, it's never really been that way.
