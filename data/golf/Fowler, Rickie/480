 Q. Couple under today. Not a whole a lot going on. Rocco was coming back and giving a chance, and the weather got a little better and all of a sudden you got excited. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it was kind of about just holding your position on that front nine. Like you said, the weather was a little tough and the course started changing and didn't play easy.
 I held my ground really well, I think, and started to make some birdies. Had a lot of good opportunities down the stretch, and I felt like I hit a lot of good putts. The hole adjust shriveled up on me.

 Q. The birdie on 14 was huge right there with that stretch coming in, and you gave yourself your opportunities. What were you thinking? Did you hear the roar on 18 or did you see it?
 RICKIE FOWLER: I heard the roar. I was down already the steps and couldn't see the green. But I could tell what the roar was for. 
 Like I said, we had a lot of good opportunities and I hit a lot of good putts; just didn't go in today.

 Q. Another good week. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Thank you.

 Q. You realized right away what that roar was, Rocco versus Van Pelt? 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, well, when we were walking down the steps I knew Rocco was on the fairway and he was about to hit. You know, he didn't just knock it close. We knew it went in. It was pretty loud.

 Q. Could you believe that?
 RICKIE FOWLER: One each day. I told him on the range this morning that last year at Frys I made an eagle each day. 
 I guess when you hole-out four times in a week, I think that helps.

 Q. Just as far as the stretch run you made birdieing on 14 and gave yourself a lot of good chances coming in, you just said the hole shriveled up on you? 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. I hit a lot of good shots, especially when I needed to. Hit a lot of really good putts. Just like I said, didn't get the reads correct. I hit 'em right where I wanted to, they just didn't go in.

 Q. Talk about your round a little bit. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: I hung in there through the front nine. Played pretty good, especially with the rain coming up. 
 You know, wanted to put myself in position for the back nine, and felt like I had a good chance and right where I wanted to be the last few holes. 
 Hit a lot of really good putts and had a lot of really good opportunities. A lot of good putts; they just didn't go in.

 Q. You made another run on the back nine. Is there something about the back nine that you like a little more this week?
 RICKIE FOWLER: I figured it out on Friday. Thursday I didn't play it that well. Last few days played the back nine nicely.
 I felt good going into the last five, six holes. Had a lot of opportunities, but the ball just didn't want to go in the hole.

 Q. What, did you over read 'em or... 
 RICKIE FOWLER: I actually missed a lot of putts I think on the high side. 15, 16, 17, and 18, missed 'em all high side.

 Q. You've had a lot of real close calls this year. What will you learn from all the close calls that you can go forward with?
 RICKIE FOWLER: I mean, every time I get in contention I keep feeling a little more comfortable than the last time. If we keep putting ourselves in the same spot, hopefully it'll payoff in the long run.
