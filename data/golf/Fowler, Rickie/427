  RICKIE FOWLER:   It was all right.   I got some‑‑ not too many bad swings, but made a lot of good swings, got a couple bad ones out of the way.   A few mud balls here and there.   Missed a birdie putt, which led to a bogey, a little three‑putt on 15.   So that obviously was a little bit of a turnaround, going from birdie to making bogey there.   
You know, like I said, I made a lot of good swings, so going to go into tomorrow knowing that we're swinging well, just get some putts to drop and get a good round going.  
   
 Q.   Was there a certain number you thought might be at the top of the leaderboard with conditions being what they were?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   No, not really.   Obviously it's a tough start out here.   You can make a couple birdies, but there's also some holes where you can get going backwards.   I was just looking to get off to a good start, and I felt like I got off to a decent one.   Made a couple bogeys, but made a lot of good swings, like I said, and made a few bogeys coming in.  
   
 Q.   Last year was your first Masters.   Compare how you felt last year at this time to how you feel now.   Were there different emotions?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I'm definitely a lot more comfortable here this year after having my first one out of the way, not that the first one is a bad thing.   I had a great group last year obviously with Jason Day and Rory.   We had a lot of fun and pulled off each other.   This year I definitely felt a lot more comfortable and a lot more at home.   
   
 Q.   There are so many guys out here that look the same, clean cut.   Walking with your galleries people talk about your hair.   Do you hear from them?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, a little bit.   Obviously with the facial hair and the mustache and stuff, it's kind of all for fun and just showing off my personality.   There's a lot of people that don't like it, and that's one of the main reasons it's still around, just showing that I'm myself and I'm not trying to be like anyone else.   Maybe it's a good lesson to some kids out there, that don't worry about what others think of you, just be yourself.   
   
 Q.   How do you rank Johnson's and Geoff's look they have going?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Theirs are definitely stronger.   They're a lot more healthy than me.   I was surprised that I could actually create some sort of shadow around the mouth there.   No, it's fun for us because obviously we've got our little‑‑ I guess our own little clan.   But like I said, it's all for fun.   We're not too worried about how they look or anything, it's just us being us.  
   
 Q.   Do you get positive reviews from the woman?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   No, it doesn't bother her.   I don't think it bothers any of the other wives of Wagner and Ogilvy.   Like I said, it's all for fun, and we're having a good time with it.   
   
 Q.   How far can you go?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   This is cleaned up right now.  
   
 Q.   Lucas Glover‑‑  
RICKIE FOWLER:   He had a very healthy beard.   Mine is not going to reach that any time soon.
