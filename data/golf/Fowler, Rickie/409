  RICKIE FOWLER:   Birdied the first two holes.   It was nice to get out of the gate like that with windy conditions.   Played pretty well, a few hiccups in the middle, but even par not too bad.  
   
 Q.   How is the wind going out there?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I loved it.   Finally got to play in the wind this week.   No, I enjoyed it.   Definitely left some out there, but a solid round.   It will definitely be tough out there for the last few groups.   It's blowing.   It's definitely a factor.   But actually I enjoyed it.   So you can definitely‑‑ you can score out there, but definitely have to be in control of your golf ball.  
   
 Q.   Did it pick up towards the end?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   It blew a little bit.   17 played pretty long into the wind.   I hit driver, 4‑iron in and I think Gary, he hits it pretty long, he hit 3‑wood, 4‑iron.   So definitely a little wind out there.   
   
 Q.   What do you think later then, low score, or is it going to be‑‑  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I mean I would think if Adam shoots something around even par, he would be pretty happy.   I wouldn't think he would need a whole lot more.   It's not playing easily out there, but actually Colsaerts played well this morning.   If you're on top of your game you can score, but it's definitely not easy.  
   
 Q.   What will you take away from this experience?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   I just love playing over here.   I love links golf.   I love the way it sets up for my game.   I love playing in the wind, getting to hit different shots on the ground or in the air.   Just a lot of fun to me over here so I enjoy it.   Like last year I had a chance.   I was in the second‑to‑last group.   And just didn't get off to the start we wanted this week and just had a few too many mistakes.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Nothing, nope.   I'm brand new to the rotation.   So I'll probably do the same as I have the last couple of years, come over early next year.   I usually play Sunday and get on from the week from there.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever thought about playing the Scottish Open as a warmup event?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Possibly, with the tough thing being that you're playing the week before would be tough just because I wouldn't see the course until Monday, being that I make the cut.   So not sure.   Definitely something we've thought about.   But would also like to prepare for The Open by getting some rounds at the course, being that we hadn't seen it before.
