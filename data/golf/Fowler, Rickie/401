Q.   Rickie, nice playing out there today.   Justin said you guys all drove the ball well, which makes the golf course a lot easier.   What were your expectations this morning? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, knowing that we had ball in hand, golf course is playing soft, knew that it was going to be key to get the ball in the fairway because you were able to clean some mud and attack the golf course from there.   Drove it fairly well, had a couple that got a little away from me, but other than that, one bogey, six birdies, off to a good start.

Q.   That is a good start.   It's a nice, solid start.   You've had a few starts in there lately that weren't your best.   What's turning it around? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, obviously a little less pressure on me right now.   I can focus on the main thing right now and making it to the next week, the TOUR Championship.   I've actually been swinging really well, just been struggling getting out of the gate.   Last week I was never really even par or under par through three or so holes, and it's nice to get off to a better start, make some birdies and kind of get going the right direction. 

Q.   Is it possible at your age to look at this recent situation and say, I'm going to make enough teams going forward, I can use this as motivation, I'm very, very young, or is it just frustrating as you're ready to get going after it again?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, it's tough.   Obviously I would like to be at Medinah in a couple weeks, but at the same time the other guys that were picked are obviously playing well right now, some guys that have been there before and done pretty well there.   I knew I was kind of borderline, kind of outside looking in on picks, with the way I've been playing recently.   I can't really be upset about anything except for recent play.   I should have been playing a little better.   Definitely a little motivation going forward, and kind of a little kick in the butt to go out there and make it on points instead of waiting on a pick.

Q.   I don't think there's any question whether you make it to the TOUR Championship or not, it's been a heck of a good year. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, it's been a great year.   Obviously got the monkey off my back there at Quail Hollow, nice to get the first one, and been a little rough through the summer, not the playing we wanted, but at the same time we've got the FedExCup to worry about right now, and I'm off to a good start, and hopefully finish it off.
