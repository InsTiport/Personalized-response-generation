Q.   Talk us through your round. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, it was nice from the start.   Nice and, I guess, simple in a way.   Just kept moving forward.   Didn't miss many shots, made some putts to continue that on from yesterday.   Felt really good about the game.   It was nice to get a little bit of everything to click after the first two days where it was a little hit and miss at times.   Feeling good about the game right now going into the weekend.

Q.   Your thoughts on playing Watson or Oosthuizen tomorrow? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, I heard Louis has been playing well.   They are both some of the best players in the world.   Bubba being one of my bet friends, we'd have a great time. 
Louis and I both have played a bit of golf together and both live down in Jupiter, Florida.   I feel like it's going to be a hard match no matter who I'm playing, obviously once up you get to the top 16.   So we'll see.   We'll see who we get and go and give it our best tomorrow.
