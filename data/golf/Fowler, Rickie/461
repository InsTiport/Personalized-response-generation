  Q. Nice putt at the end there. Nice opening round.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. I'm glad we're finished after we made the turn. Got off to a very rough start. Didn't make any birdies until 14. So I made four in the last five holes there. So definitely a nice way to finish.   
 I'm looking forward to getting into tomorrow. And it was nice playing alongside Rory, looked like he was doing everything right. Saw a few balls go in the hole so that definitely helped me make some putts in the end.  
  
  Q. What was it at the start? Just feel for the greens or anything in particular?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I missed a couple shots. Rough drive on 1.   
 2, I had my foot slip actually and hit it in a spot where I was trying to hit it left of the pin at 2.   
 So a couple little things. I made a couple good up-and-downs on the first 14 holes there to keep me in it and just kind of battled back with some good birdies.   
  
  Q. Anything that was a key in those up-and-downs?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I hit them fairly close, good pitches or chips. I think I got up-and-down on 7 from 130 yards, so it was a good iron shot in there. But when they're five to 10 feet you usually, they're not easy to putt out here. So it was nice to make good putts with those and stuff that will help me -- I had some birdie chances in the end so that helped me.  
  
  Q. It seemed like you guys shared a light moment after you hit on number 7. What was that? You turned around and maybe somebody got hit there or something, what was story that you guys shared there?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: On 7? I can't remember that. I know he hit it left, I hit it right. But we had a lot of fun playing together. Obviously he played really well today. Nice to see him do that. He looked like he was swinging with a lot of confidence.   
 I thought he was going to get a couple more, close to 8 or 9. But it was nice to see someone play well like that. So we're going to give it a shot tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Is that Masters green? I was wondered if it had a title of Masters green?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: That was the only reason we made it. How is that?   
  
  Q. Is that really the Masters green?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I told Puma I wanted to get it as close as we can. It's a little lighter. No, I told Puma I wanted to do it and they were all for it, so we decided to do it Thursday in the opening round.  
  
  Q. If you won the jacket would you the hat backwards?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Out here? You know, I mean, I would take it off, but I think Puma would want to see it on at some point.   
  
  Q. Forward or backwards?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Well around here it's forwards. Once I get off -- if I had a chance, I might throw it on backwards.   
  
  Q. Any other colors coming? Obviously it's going to be OSU orange on Sunday?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I got to stick to my orange, stick to my roots on Sunday.   
  
  Q. Do you have some bright pink?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Everything looks good with a Green Jacket. Tomorrow -- I think that Puma has my scripts out, so tomorrow's kind of blue, it's got some stripes on the front, all kinds of colors. Green back on Saturday -- if we make it to the weekend that is. And then orange Sunday.  
  
  Q. A different color green?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: It's a little bit lighter, yeah.   
  
  Q. Do your friends this age get with this crowd? Or do they have no idea?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: A little bit. A lot of my friends back home, not being around golf, guys I went to high school with, they're starting to realize obviously that they're seeing stuff like the Masters and the Ryder Cup and they're realizing that it's a pretty cool thing and it's nice to have the support that I do from everyone back home.
