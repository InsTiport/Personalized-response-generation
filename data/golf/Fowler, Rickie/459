  Q. Along side Rickie Fowler, who says, I'm just trying to get in under the radar alongside the other two guys who are a collective 23 under I believe right now. How contagious is good play among a trio of players?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Well good play definitely helps out. Obviously seeing Jason make a lot of birdies today, Rory made a lot of birdies yesterday. I was hanging around, I shot 70, 69 and in a way snuck in under the radar with them putting up 65 and 64 the last two days. So it's fun playing here with guys that are playing well, guys I'm good friends with and it definitely helps being around good play.  
  
  Q. How close are you, for people who don't know, with those other guys and what sorts of things are you saying to one another even as you're trying to manage your own game?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: We're definitely chatting it up a bit down the fairways and when we have a little bit of off time. I spent some time with Jason off the course, a little bit with Rory, obviously played Walker Cup against Rory in 2007, stayed friends since then.   
 We're good buddies, but we're trying to beat up each other one the course as much as we can.
