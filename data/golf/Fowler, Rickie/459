 Q. How was it out there today?
 RICKIE FOWLER: It was pretty cool. I got a little practice round in last week, so I wasn't going into the par-3 contest blind. 
 So pretty cool, I got to play with my two good friends, Peter, one of my best friends and Nathan, my Walker Cup teammate.

 Q. How close were you to hitting Bubba Watson there?
 RICKIE FOWLER: First hole I got really close. Aiming right at him. And I was trying to make it. But Bubba gave me a bad read. 
 (Laughter.)

 Q. We got a local guy Russ Henley, from Macon, who is going to try to do what you did with the Walker Cup, try to qualify. Can you talk about how tough that is and if he's the type of player that you would expect to be out here soon?
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, he's definitely one of the top college players, when I was there and now he's still playing well. So it is tough to do, but if you go with some confidence with playing well, going into some PGA TOUR events and then the Q-School, going in with confidence it makes things a lot easier. So it's doable, but, yeah, it is tough.
