Q. Was patience the key word out there with the difficult conditions?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, definitely. I mean, patience and not trying to, I guess, get a whole lot out of it at times. Just get the ball in play and get the ball into the biggest part of the green and try and control speed whether you're into the wind or downwind. I had a couple good looks on the front nine. I wasn't able to take advantage of those. Yeah, at that point it is patience. You can't really press too much. I saw Patrick had a good round out there today. That's some solid golf. But glad I was able to get a couple coming in.
Q. I saw a couple times you were shaking your head on some putts. Is that because you're still getting used to the new greens and what you're not expecting the putt to do?
RICKIE FOWLER: I think the greens still need some time to settle. They've still got a little new-green wiggle to them, and there's some low areas. Like 9, there was a little trough left of the hole. My ball was breaking in, I thought it was going to go in the middle, and it caught the inside of the trough and kicked it left. No, I think obviously this place was due for a resurfacing, but as we all know, new surface only gets better with a few years under its belt. We're all here playing the same surfaces and stuff. Some putts are going to go in, some make you shake your head, and today's conditions sometimes make you shake your head at the same time, too.
