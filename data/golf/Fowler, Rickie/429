Q.   This is kind of your home.   You definitely have a lot of crowd no matter where you go, but you must enjoy this?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, it's always nice to play here in San Diego.   It is the closest tournament to where I grew up.   I have a lot of friends and family to come out.   It's definitely a lot of fun to play in front of them.

Q.   The North course, you know if you're going to be in contention on Sunday, you've got to do well on it. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, well, the North course, if you start on it, you've got to get off to a good start.   You play it Friday and you feel like you can make up ground. 
So it is a place where you can make birdies.   But the South, obviously, we play three rounds, so you have to hang in there through those three rounds.
