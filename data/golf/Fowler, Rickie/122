Q. Rickie, got off to the start you wanted with that eagle at 1.  After that you struggled.  What was the difference between the first two days and today?
RICKIE FOWLER: I didn't make anything.  I made the putt on 1 from off the green.  I made a good par save on 7.
Really, other than that, didn't see much go on.  The greens are getting pretty beat up with the greens firming up, the spikes marks.  Everyone is playing.
It's not an excuse, by any means.  We're playing on the same greens.  Started to have a lot more with the ball rolling.
Q. Is it the golf course is starting to change, a little tougher?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah.  It becomes a little bit firmer and becomes a little more finer line, you got to hit the numbers and have control of the golf ball.  Ultimately play out of the fairway.  Like I said, I think the biggest thing for me not seeing anything go in.
Q. Do you like the chase?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I'm fine with it.  I think ultimately you go in there and just wanting to have a chance come Sunday.  So we're taking care of that.  I would like today to be a little better but we got that round out of the way and be ready for tomorrow.
