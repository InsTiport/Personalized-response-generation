Q. So 67, 68 for Rickie Fowler, in the mix heading into the weekend.  Why do you continue to do so well here?
RICKIE FOWLER: I think out of any Tour events, I have played the most rounds here.  This is my ninth time.  It's fun playing in front of the loud crowds.
Q. How motivated are you for the weekend?
RICKIE FOWLER: (Indiscernible.)  I have played some good golf the last two days, but I'm going to have to play better over the next two days if I want a chance of winning.
