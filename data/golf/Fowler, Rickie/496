   DOUG MILNE: Okay. We'd like to welcome Rickie Fowler. Thanks for joining us for a few minutes here before the start the Travelers Championship. You played here last year on a sponsor's exemption. I know you played this morning. Just some thoughts on your game as you're heading into the week.
 RICKIE FOWLER: My game is a lot better than last year. I learned quite a bit. Hopefully we can do a little bit better than last year, we missed the cut. 
 Looking forward to this week, course looks great, a bit soft out there right now, but other than that, looks like it's in great condition. Looking forward to it drying out the next couple days and hopefully a good Sunday.
 DOUG MILNE: You're off to an incredible rookie season. You've had two second place finishes. A minute ago you were talking about comfort level. You're a lot more comfortable-feeling these days when you get into position. Can you just talk a little bit about -- follow up on that, being comfortable and the state of your game? 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. My early-on runner-up finish was at Waste Management in Phoenix in Arizona, and I guess I was a bit uptight in the final round, although I did play well and ended up losing by one. 
 And I went to Memorial and was tied for first after the first day and went and actually led the rest of the tournament up until the final nine holes, probably the most comfortable I've ever felt in any golf tournament being in contention. So just being in contention the more often that I can is only going to help in my eyes that I see for how well that I felt at Memorial compared to Waste Management was a huge difference.
 DOUG MILNE: And before we take questions real quick, just a little bit about the course specifically, how it kind of suits your eye. I mentioned you're leading the Kodak Challenge, which is the 14th hole this year. That's kind of a daunting, tempting hole. Just some comments on the course, and kind of being the leader of the Kodak Challenge. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: It's a pretty fun course. It's not very long. You need to definitely hit the fairways and the greens. If you're not on the fairway, it's going to be tough to hit a lot of the greens and have a good look at birdie. I'm not going to be trying to bomb it anywhere, just keep it in short grass and hopefully give ourselves some good looks at birdies. 
 Like you mentioned, Doug, is it 14? 
 DOUG MILNE: 15. Sorry. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: 15. You won't see me lay up. We'll get it up there somewhere around the green hopefully all four days and maybe give ourselves a look at eagle from the putting surface, but I think it's just a hole where you go for it and try and make a number.
 DOUG MILNE: Okay. With that we'll go ahead and open it up for questions. 

 Q. What did you do, you had a couple weeks off. What have you done over those couple weeks?
 RICKIE FOWLER: Just relaxed, hung out with friends and family. Played a bit, got some practice in, went to an on "Entourage" premier, hung out, watched a little bit of the Open, and that was about it.

 Q. Was it good to have a couple of weeks off to kind of analyze where you're going so far this year and going to be more refreshed going into this week?
 RICKIE FOWLER: I think it's more just kind of relax. You know, it's been a really fun year. I haven't really had to think back too much, but it is pretty fun to think back about the things we have done. 
 I was a bit worn out after Memorial and then having to do the qualifier the Monday after. So needed the time off, and it was fun to watch the Open, although it would have been a little bit better to be there, and just ready to get back going these next three weeks. 

 Q. Have you ever played Pebble? 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. I played in the Cal Invitational, played in AT & T there earlier this week, and I played the week before the Open and then caddied in the U.S. Open Challenge.

 Q. Talk about some of your favorite courses. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Pebble is up there. Torrey South is one of my favorites. Royal County Down is my all-time favorite. So a little bit of variety there.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Walker Cup, '07.

 Q. Do you look at the glass as more half full than half empty being so close a couple of times but not winning?
 RICKIE FOWLER: I'm not sure if I really look at it either way. I look at it, you know, we've had a pretty good year being where we are FedExCup points, leading the Kodak Challenge to a bunch of top 10s. It's been a lot of fun, so we're knocking on the door and ready to win as soon as possible.

 Q. Is Ryder Cup a goal? 
 RICKIE FOWLER: It's right at the top. 
 DOUG MILNE: Okay. Well, Rickie, we appreciate your time, as always. Best of luck this week. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Thank you.
