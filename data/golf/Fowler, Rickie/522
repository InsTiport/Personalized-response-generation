   JOHN BUSH: We've got Rickie Fowler with us here in the interview room at the Frys.com Open. A 6-under par, 64. I know you're probably a little bit disappointed not winning in the playoff, but overall a pretty phenomenal week for you. If we can just get your comments.  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I'm pretty excited about the week. You know, if you would have told me I was gonna be in a playoff with a chance to win Sunday afternoon, I would have jumped on that in a heartbeat. Went out and got out to a great start this morning. Topped that off with a hole-in-one at 5, so that was pretty special.  
 JOHN BUSH: All right. We'll go right into questions.   
  
  Q. Talk us through waiting for the playoff to begin. What kind of nerves were going through you after the way you finished? It was a bogey. Did you think there was a shot after you were already done and you had to go back out?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I knew there was a shot because 17 and 18 was both playing fairly tough, especially with the wind picking up. You know, Troy, I think he bogeyed 17 and 18. I bogeyed 18 as well, and then Jamie made a great birdie there to get in the playoff.   
 So I knew there was a shot, but Troy had a putt from about ten feet there to win it outright. You know, got a second chance, and Troy stepped up and hit a great shot there on 17.  
  
  Q. Did you feel like you did everything you could possibly could to win this thing, or do you have to kick yourself a little bit? Is there one shot you have to kick yourself for?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: You know, I hit some wayward shots in the playoff. I can't really pick out one particular shot or anything. I mean, you're gonna miss shots during a tournament. You can't expect to hit every shot perfect and have a perfect week.  
 So, no, I mean, I'm pretty stoked to have had a chance to win it. You know, I felt like I played four pretty good rounds, especially after slapping it around yesterday and still put up a decent score.   
 To go out today and get off to the start I did and put myself back in contention, it was a great week.  
  
  Q. Your second shot an 17, you just come off it a little bit or just push it?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I came out of it. I was trying go right at the pin. I was just trying to hit a straight ball right at it, and the wind took it to the right, you know, I would have a 10-, 15-footer.   
 And I kind of did the opposite on 18. I was trying to hit one straight at the hole. If the wind took it to the left, I would have a 10-, 15-footer. Like I said, I just made two kind of wayward swings.   
 I was just pretty excited to have that opportunity to be in the playoff.   
  
  Q. What do you think you'll learn from this playoff for the future?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: You know, this is my second playoff I've been in in a professional event. I lost in a playoff in a Nationwide event end of July down in Columbus, and then in this one as well.  
 The more playoffs you're in I think the more comfortable you feel. I'm always gonna feel nerves, but maybe next time I'll feel just a little bit more comfortable than I did today.  
  
  Q. What are your plans in terms of this coming week? What's your status right now in terms of Q-School?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Right now I'm gonna go to Viking next week. Gonna fly out in the morning. And then I'm not sure if I'm gonna get to second, possibly third stage. The plans are still to go to Q-School.   
 I'm gonna go into next week with the same game plan I did those last two. Seemed to work out pretty well these last two weeks, so we'll see what happens next week.   
  
  Q. Great tournament. As you progressed through the rounds, the crowds grew, the excitement. Kind of got on entourage, whether you wanted to or not. How does that make you feel? Does it push you a little bit harder, or is it easier for you when you got people like that really cheering for you?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: You know, easier if you're playing well; tough if you're playing bad. You definitely want to please the fans. You know, it's definitely fun having a lot of people out there. Definitely makes it a lot more exciting. There's more to play for.   
 Like I said, you want to please the fans. The more people you get out there, the better. I felt like we had a pretty good following for all the final groups. It was pretty cool in the playoff to be coming down 18 and coming back up 17 with the amount of people we had out there.  
  
  Q. Are you surprised it's come this fast?   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yes and no. I knew I was capable of coming out and competing. But to finish tied for seventh and then tied for first and then losing a playoff, pretty quick start.   
 So like I said, I'm just looking forward to next week and to hopefully put together four more good rounds and see where we're going from there.
