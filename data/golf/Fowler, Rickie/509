 Q. Rickie, great start. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it was nice. We were kind of out there cruising along, and I told my caddie, let's see if we can get through the turn going bogey-free. Started off well, six birdies on the front nine, which helped out, and a few good birdies in there toward the end.

 Q. Six birdies, no bogeys. When you hit 15 greens and average 296 off the tee, usually a good combination. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, driver I was pulling a little bit, but straightened it out and managed to hit some fairways. Hitting greens and hitting the ball almost 300 definitely helps put yourself in good position. 

 Q. Are the fairways a little soft out here? Is the entire golf course pretty receptive right now?
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it's a lot different than last year. Last year it played really firm, ball was going a lot longer, but it's getting close. The course has dried out quite a bit just today, this afternoon. Looking forward to playing tomorrow when the course is going to be a lot different than it was this morning.

 Q. Speaking of last year, you played here as an amateur. Does the last year seem like a blur? You've gone from amateur to part-time status out here to full-time status to in contention. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Not so much of a blur. I remember all the stuff. I've done a lot of fun things along the way, playing here, the Open at Bethpage, the Walker Cup, having a great Fall Series and making it through Q-school. Now we're out here, we've got status, and hopefully we can keep playing well. 

 Q. A lot of guys out here color coordinate, but you have the hat, the shirt, the pants and even the Puma shoes with the little blue in them to perfectly match your outfit. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, Puma is a great fit for me. I'm definitely a little bit different on the golf course than most of the traditional golfers. I like to stick out and do my own thing. I play golf a little different than most, and I thought it was a perfect fit for me.
