Q. What'd you think?
RICKIE FOWLER: It just played tough out there.  I love playing in the wind.  It's just unfortunate I wasn't swinging well this week and was trying to clean some stuff up, but had to kind of go the wrong way.  Had a lot of putts that coulda shoulda went in, but that's the way it is.
Just a tough day for golf.  And be a little bit off, it's going pick you apart pretty quickly.  So you can obviously see by scores this afternoon, not many under par.  I think D.J. may be one of the only ones, kind of the later tee times.
But everyone is playing the same golf course this afternoon, as far as the guys that started anywhere within a chance.  Be interesting to see how this finishes up.  At least D.J. is giving himself a shot.  Brooks is going to have to play well coming in to finish it off.
Q. The conditions today make it that much harder out here?
RICKIE FOWLER: It's hard to really explain to people at home or the people that maybe haven't played, here or in a major kind of on a golf course that's set up properly for a true test.  It's a lot different.  Yeah.
I mean, I think the scores speak for themselves.  It's -- this is links golf weather where you can play the ball on the ground and hit shots and stuff like that.  It's hard when you got to drive the ball well to hit the fairway and dodge the thick rough out here.
Like I said, everyone's playing the same place.  It's just a hard day to play this, which is already a hard golf course in perfect conditions.
Q. What takeaways do you have, especially with another major around the corner?
RICKIE FOWLER: I just got some work to do.  Other than today, scrambling and putting was great all week.  I felt good with how I kind of fought through.  Haven't had anywhere near my best stuff, just find a way to get around, and did a good job of that the first three days.
So minor things that just need to be tightened up a bit, and we'll be fine.
Q. Are you playing every week from now to Pebble?
RICKIE FOWLER: No, that would be way too much.  I never play other -- earlier this year I played four weeks in a row, but that was a one-off.  Probably won't happen again.  I never play more than two or three weeks in a row.  I play this week, next week and Memorial, have a week off for U.S. Open.
