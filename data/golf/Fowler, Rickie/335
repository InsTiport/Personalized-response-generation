Q. A really strong finish for you, you birdied the last two holes, you have one bogey in the last 36 holes.RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it's been a good short game show the last two days.  I've gotten up-and-down a couple tough spots and kept the momentum going.  Putting the ball very well.  Seeing my lines well.  So hitting a lot of good putts, it's a good thing.  I had a few go in today.Q. You came into the tournament 10th in FedExCup points.  Still very possibly a top-5 finish, a win in Atlanta, you're the FedExCup champion.  It all depends on Sunday?RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, let's see if we can go out and have a good solid round tomorrow.  It's still a long stretch.  A lot of golf left to play, but all in all it would be nice to have a chance next Sunday in Atlanta to hold up the FedExCup.Q. You were talking about your short game and your putting and chipping, any mechanical adjustment or just golf?RICKIE FOWLER: Maybe a couple slight tweaks here and there, just to help out with some fundamentals, but nothing crazy. Probably one of my easiest up-and-downs today from one of the green side bunkers on the uphill lie, was the one that I didn't get up-and-down. So, no, it was good.  Good confidence.  It definitely helps me rolling the ball well to know that I get it up there inside basically 10 feet and it's good.Q. What kind of changed your round around there on the turn, shot 4-under on the back?RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I was kind of just --  kind of scraped it around the front.  Made some really good up-and-downs, made some good pars to keep it going.  Made a nice putt on 9 to turn an even par. Back nine, I finally was able to piece together some shots, give myself some looks at birdies and just needed to putt well.Q. Do you still have a low one in you tomorrow?RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I haven't played a solid round yet.  Kind of just hung in there the last two days, just played some solid golf, nothing crazy. I made some good putts, so we'll see if we can get to swinging a little bit better tomorrow, a little more fairways and greens and continue to keep the putter hot and definitely, got a low one in us.Q. The way that the scores have been posted last couple days, is there a feeling someone can charge from the back and win this thing?RICKIE FOWLER: It's going to be tough.  You saw Morgan today shoot 62.  It's out there.  But, you have to have control of your golf ball, and you have to make putts, that's -- it's not easy to make putts on these greens from outside 10, 12 feet.  So, fairways and greens first and then hopefully, the putter stays hot, and we'll get a low one tomorrow.
