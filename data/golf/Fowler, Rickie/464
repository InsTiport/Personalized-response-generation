 Q. Obviously not the turnout you had hoped for, but you played really well. You've got to be feeling good about the way you're playing?
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I had a couple of stretches where I wasn't playing too good. It's a fluke thing. I think that only occurs in match play, where you try to do something crazy like that. 
 I'm disappointed about 11 and 12, missing some little up-and-downs and short putts that I thought definitely helped the match go the other way. I tried to fight at the end. 
 Kuch just made some putts today. And he made them when he needed to and obviously closed me out on 17, with a good little 5-footer.
