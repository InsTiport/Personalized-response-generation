 Q.   You ran a very solid race with 4‑under par today.   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Definitely happy with the round today.   Off to a solid start.   Hit a lot of good shots out there and a good, solid round.   To shoot 68 in some tough conditions on a tough golf course and be six back, wouldn't really expect that.   
   
 Q.   You hit 16 greens in regulation, did you feel this ball striking and play coming along?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I've been swinging well for quite some time and just not getting much out of it.   Got some good work in with Butch the week before the Honda last week and wasn't able to get anything going.   
Made a few mistakes last week, too many balls in the water, which can happen at Honda.   But it finally did what I was supposed to be doing, hit a lot of greens and made it fairly stress‑free.   
   
 Q.   Course conditions, how is it out there?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's tough.   I mean, 62 isn't exactly there.   But you've got to be on top of your game and hit a lot of great golf shots, make some putts.   
The greens are firm.   With them being fairly new, downwind, downgrain, tough to hold the greens, especially coming in with longer irons so you have to be on your numbers and have control of your golf ball.
