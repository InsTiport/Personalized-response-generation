Q. Thoughts on the round out there. Obviously fun to birdie 16, I'm sure.
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, a 2 on 16 is always a highlight. Got off to a little slow start bogeying 10 and 11, but happy with where the game's at, felt like I made a lot of good swings out there. I had a few holes slip away, not birdieing 13, making bogey on 17, but we needed a low one to get back into some sort of the mix today and just really didn't get anything going. Like I said, bogeying the first two holes out of the gate kind of puts a damper on things pretty quickly. But, yeah, happy with everything on how it's coming together, nice to see some putts go in this week. Obviously a good round yesterday and we'll come back out tomorrow and see if we can move ourself up the board a bit.
Q. How do you approach the final round when you know, barring shooting a 59, you're probably not really in the mix?
RICKIE FOWLER: I mean, even tomorrow if I shoot 59 I don't have a chance. So, yeah, I mean, go keep working on things that you're working on. I'm going into a little bit of a break after this, so it's always nice to end on a high note, like I said try and go move up the board tomorrow and get the most out of the week that we can. So looking forward to it, I know I got another low one in me, at least mid to low 60s. And it will be a little quieter out here tomorrow, there will be some people nursing a hangover and getting ready for the Super Bowl, so we'll go see if we can get a good one and then saddle up and watch the football.
Q. Last year I know you had D.J. Gregory walking the course with you when you were playing those winning rounds, if I'm correct. What was that like and how like inspiring was that as you were kind of playing those winning rounds?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I mean we have D.J., he walks with us quite a bit through the year, at least two events. Yeah, he's a good friend of ours, obviously we support his charity and everything that he does. So it's always fun to have him around, we take him any time he doesn't have someone to maybe walk with and, like I said, we at least do a couple weeks a year where he's walking with us. So, yeah, obviously a great friend and like I said, he's a big supporter of us as we are of him.
Q. What is your sense of how well known and respected he is around the TOUR?
RICKIE FOWLER: I mean as far as on TOUR and around the TOUR everyone knows D.J., loves what he does, loves what he stands for. And I think there's some people, fans and outside of players that do know about him. But it's a really cool story, if there's people ever kind of wondering of something kind of cool to catch up on -- I think the TOUR did a piece a few years or quite a few years back now on him and his dad and how they got started walking and following players and ultimately turning into a charitable thing. So, no, it's cool, we love having him around, everyone loves D.J.
