An interview with:
RICKIE FOWLER
THE MODERATOR: A number of clutch shots.  Do you feel the positives outweighed the negatives this week?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, definitely.  I wish I would have putted better the last three days, but I made a lot of good swings.  This one hurts.
THE MODERATOR: Quick few questions.
Q. How much will this sting?  Walk us through the thought process, 17.
RICKIE FOWLER: I mean, it's gonna hurt because I felt like I had it, especially with the way I was swinging.  17, it was 304 front and then we had an extra, it's like 26 or, I don't know, there's 30-some yards until the back bunker.  It's 330-plus.
Figured -- I'm hitting a chip-cut driver.  Usually don't expect it to hit on the downslope and then go 360.
So that was a bit unfortunate.  I hit it right online, hit it exactly where I was looking.  That's kind of the unfortunate part to hit the shots that I did and to pull them off and then it kind of backfired there.  Hit a perfect shot.
Q. What about the second time you played 17?  3-wood or 5-wood?
RICKIE FOWLER: I went the 3-wood.  It's a good number with 3-wood obviously with everything going on.  Hit it solid.  Just hit it a little high on the face and it just got up and left a little quicker than I was expecting and wanted to.  So that's all that happened there.
Q. You haven't usually been this down in a long time.  What will you do to get over it and how long will it take to get over it?
RICKIE FOWLER: I mean, the hard part is having, you know, all my friends and family and grandpa and my dad who haven't seen me win.  But I will be able to kinda hang with them tonight.
I'll be all right.  With how good I'm playing, I know I can win.  That's the hard part.
