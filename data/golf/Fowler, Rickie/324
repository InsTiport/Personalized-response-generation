  RICKIE FOWLER:   I got a lot out of it.   Managed to score pretty well today as far as only hitting six fairways, and the rough out here is pretty penal.   So I'm happy about that.   Tested the short game a bit, made a couple good putts today to keep the round going, bogey‑free, which is always nice.   
Yeah, see if we can clean things up for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Seemed like you had to be very patient out there at times?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I did.   Like I said I had to make some putts for pars today that kind of kept the round going, and patience was key.   Especially when you're not driving the ball in the fairway as much as I would like to, missing a few greens and luckily the short game and putter helped me out.   
I played solid the first two days, off to a great start.   But nothing two good rounds on the weekend‑‑ he's definitely in a position where we can catch him.   So see what we can do.  
   
 Q.   I know you're going to tell me it's hotel, golf course this week, but have you managed to see anything of China or do anything?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I was a part of the group of guys that did the ceremony on Tuesday down at the Bund.   It was the lantern ceremony to start the tournament, so I've been down there and downtown Shanghai for the one night and looking forward to going in there Sunday night.   Other than that during the tournament just been hanging out, golf course, hotel, hotel here we have some good food, good accommodations.   HSBC takes care of us this week.  
   
 Q.   Do you like the local fare?   Have you tried anything?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   I grew up having rice with pretty much every meal, so I'm good with rice, any noodle dishes.   Yeah, I can get by just fine here.
