Q. Rickie, usually stuck on 67 is not a bad gig, but Charley is going nuts right now.
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, Charley had a good day out there.  I think he likes this place.  Doesn't matter what kind of year he's having, how he's playing the week before, he always seems to find a way to play good here.
I'm looking forward to this weekend.  Game feels good.  I'm really looking forward to getting out here and putting some good scores up the next two days.
Q. Condition of the golf course and the forecast shows that the scores are probably going to get lower.  You're going to have to be aggressive out there, aren't you?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, and that's what's fun.  When you play well, you're able to go out and make birdies.  And I was able to make a lot of those today, just had a couple of mistakes that cost me a few shots.  But, yeah, I'm ready to play some offense, and go toe-to-toe with some of these guys and it will make it fun.
Q. Keep going and climb the ladder?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah.
Q. Difference between last week and this week?
RICKIE FOWLER: I didn't play all that much better here, just had some swings that cost me a bit last week to miss the weekend.  Game was good then.  Game is feeling good here this week.  So I'm excited to get some rest this afternoon, tomorrow morning, and come out firing tomorrow afternoon.
Q. Since PLAYERS you had the second at QuickLoans National, tied for 10th at Akron?
RICKIE FOWLER: I won Scottish.
Q. You won Scottish.  You've had a couple of missed cuts.  How would you characterize your play?
RICKIE FOWLER: It's been a little up and down, which isn't exactly what I want.  I want to be more consistent.  I wouldn't really trade anything for winning, getting the job done like that.  So when my game is on and good we're putting ourselves in the right position, just need to get rid of some of those weeks where it might be a little off.  Other than that I'm not going to complain about winning.
Q. The beginning of the year, you had a two win season, that's pretty good.
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, definitely happy.  The goal coming in was to win and win multiple times.  We've done that.  Obviously another goal was to win a major, but that is something I have to go back and get ready for next year, get ready to get after the majors.  All in all it's been a nice year.
Q. Would you rather have this year than last year when you were in all the majors but didn't win?
RICKIE FOWLER: I would rather win.  But, no, just put last year and this year together and I would be right there.  A couple of wins and top fives in the majors.  It's tough, you see guys go up and down, it's hard to be very consistent week in and week out, even just through a month to a whole year.
Yeah, looking forward to getting through the playoffs, a few more events in the fall and have a little bit of downtime, rethink things, work on the game, work in the gym and get ready to go.
Q. Last year you said there were going to be some people who think golf is a dorky sport forever, and there's nothing you can do about that.  Do you think with the way you and Jason and Jordan played and Rory this year there are people that think it's a dorky sport now, are you converting people?
RICKIE FOWLER: We may be converting people.  But there are always going to be haters.  But I guarantee they can't play worth a lick.  So they're not going to hate on the game if they're good at all.
Q. You had a very public relationship.  Would you do that again?  The next time will you play it out in public?
RICKIE FOWLER: I'm not sure.  We'll see how things roll.
Q. Can you look back, is there any downside to that in terms of repercussions for you or anybody?
RICKIE FOWLER: No, no regrets.
