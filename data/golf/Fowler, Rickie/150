Q. Good finish, talk me through the day there.  How big was that to keep you in the mix?
RICKIE FOWLER: It was good to get off to a good solid start, 4-under through 7 and made a lot of really good swings out there.  11 of 14 fairways, 15 of 18 greens.  Just had two holes get away from me.  Other than that it was 16 really good golf holes.  Definitely pleased with the way I got off to a good start, just on the day as a whole I made a lot of good swings.  2-under, good solid start, no one's going crazy low or anything like that, so a lot of golf to be played.
Q. How has your game been trending recently?
RICKIE FOWLER: It's been good.  Unfortunately, I was sick the week before Zurich, so no excuses there, it would have been nice if Jason and I could have played a little bit better as a team and I wish I could have helped him a little bit more and we could have played and done the weekend.  But nice to be back to being healthy and having my strength back.  So it makes a huge difference, especially when you start dealing with the heat this week.
Q. Being a past champion, does it free you up any when you come back here, knowing you had a bunch of success?
RICKIE FOWLER: It's great coming here where I know I played well.  It's relaxing.  And obviously having a win here, yeah, it makes it a lot more special when you show up for this week.  And once a PLAYERS champion, always a PLAYERS champion.
