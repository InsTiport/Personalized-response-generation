Q. (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER: It was wet and matted down, so, yeah. Tough. Golf's not an easy game. 

Q. (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER: No, I ‑‑ it was fine. I made some good swings. I made a good swing on 10, even the approach shot, just kind of a back to the right hop and hopped in the bunker. If it hops forward it's close. 
I played 11 and 12 nice. 
And then just had a couple get away from me on 13.
And 15 I hit a great shot, wind dies down, ball goes over the green. 
16, wind's supposed to be off to the left and I tugged it a little bit, but end up in the water. And they add up quick.

Q. What did you hit there?
RICKIE FOWLER: 7. 

Q. Anything during the practice days that may have suggested this was possible?
RICKIE FOWLER: No, obviously, golf's tough, it is a fine line, especially at this place. You see Jordan [Spieth] out there, I think he's at five or so right now. I mean, I go play a decent back nine and I'm 3‑under par. It can go either way and it can definitely go the other way, the high number way, a lot easier than it can the low. 

Q. The wind today, how much of a factor was that?
RICKIE FOWLER: Quite a bit. I mean, it would lay down at times and if you're playing poor it ends up a little long. A lot of the ones that it picked up on me, it kind of started gusting, it was on 4 early‑‑ I may have got up‑and‑down, there's nothing wrong, I'll take three there any day‑‑ but, I mean, the ball pitched to about 15, 20 yards short of where I was trying to hit it. I think I had 180 hole and the ball pitched to 160. And I hit a pretty good 6‑iron. So, it's just, it's coming up and laying down here and there, so you got to judge it and time it right. 

Q. How disappointed are you to be where you're sitting right now?
RICKIE FOWLER: Very.
