Q. What's the biggest boost of confidence you have after this round?
RICKIE FOWLER: I didn't exactly get what I wanted out of the round today.  Hung in there.  2-under is not great.  The course was fairly gettable today and had a couple holes that I probably threw away in between those two holes, four shots in total.  Should have been six pretty easily.
So we're fine.  Have a fun night and play a little bit better tomorrow, that's for sure.  See if we can at least post something low and see what happens.
No, happy to be back in Vegas being here to be a part of the tournament with Shriners Hospitals.  It's awesome what they do, and to be here and be a part of it.  Just need to play a little bit better.
Q. I think you mentioned you might go to the hockey game tonight.
RICKIE FOWLER: No, not going to go to the game.  Just go to dinner.  Hockey would be fun.  Obviously it's been a big attraction now that they have a team here in Vegas.  Get to a game at some point, but not tonight.
