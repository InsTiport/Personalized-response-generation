 Q. Just wanted to know, on 18 apparently you hit a fan by accident.   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I just found out about that, so we're finding out some information on it.  
   
 Q.   What shot was it?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   I was back in the fairway.   I had 5‑iron in.   I actually had a lot of mud on my ball, so I was aiming at the people on the left because the mud was on the left side of the ball, and you can't miss 18 right with that pin, so I was aiming as far left as I could, and if the mud took over, it ends up on the green.   If not, it ends up where it's aimed.   So kind of the shot I had to play.  
   
 Q.   And where did it end up?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   It hit up in the gallery on the left side.   It was just on the downslope left of the green.  
   
 Q.   And the downslope on the left is where it ended up?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   And you ended up making‑‑  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I made 4.  
   
 Q.   And did you see the fan at all?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I didn't.   Usually‑‑ I mean, the feelings I've gotten from out here, I think they kind of keep everything pretty hush‑hush as much as they can.   Some of the security guys told my caddie when we were walking off of 18.   I sent my agent back to find out some more information to see what we can do.
