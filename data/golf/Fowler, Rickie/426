  RICKIE FOWLER:   This is a tournament that I've played most.   Obviously I've got to thank the Thunderbirds a lot for having me here as an amateur and the continued support and them putting on a great tournament with Waste Management now.   It's one that I look forward to coming to every year, and it's a lot of fun playing it.

Q.   A couple under, solid opening round for you. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, not as much as I wanted but a start in the right direction, and going to be looking to get a little more out of it tomorrow and hopefully shave a few shots off.

Q.   You hole out a wedge from 68 yards out and you walk past me and say‑‑
RICKIE FOWLER:   That was a little makeup from another wedge shot a couple years ago, so it felt good to make it to that pin.   I mean, it was pretty similar in the final round a couple years ago.

Q.   It's good that you have a good memory about a tournament that may have slipped away.   Tell me about this outfit because Saturday is green.   Do you have anything else green, because you've got the lime green shirt, lime green shoes, kelly green pants, lime green hat.   Do you have any other green you're going to show us on Saturday?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I think being partnered up with Puma, I think I've got plenty of green waiting around, so I'll be all right.
