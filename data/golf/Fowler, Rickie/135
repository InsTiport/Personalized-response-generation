Q. Was today a better 71 than yesterday's?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it was.  I got it around and made a couple of good birdies early, a couple of dumb bogeys with some three-putts.  I could have turned it into a little better round than it was.  But it wasn't easy out there.
It was fun.  I love playing in the wind.  It creates a bit of a challenge, and I felt I did a good job of it.  A couple of bad swings, but really take those two three-putts and just two-putt and I shoot under-par, which is a great score out there.
Q. (Inaudible.)
RICKIE FOWLER: No, I never root against anyone or hope anything bad happens.  That's part of the draw, part of the Open, you never know what weather is going to happen or when it's going to happen.  So you kind of just play when you get to play.  And if stuff comes in or it's bad you just make the most of it.
So it will be interesting to see.  I might go hit a couple of balls.  I'm going to sign some autographs in the autograph zone, and after that I'm sure I'll be on the couch watching it happen, whether it's -- it will be interesting to see this afternoon, I know there's potential for bad weather.
