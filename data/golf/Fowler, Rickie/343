  RICKIE FOWLER:   Made a couple of good swings.   Drove a little bit better, drove it to the fairway.   I think I missed two that got away from me.   But kept the ball out in front of me and was able to get some good shots on some greens, actually make some putts. 
I feel like I had some better looks on my front nine that I missed and was able to take advantage of a couple other ones on the back.

Q.   How did the course play?   Did the course play differently today?   I know you played in the afternoon, different than the morning yesterday. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   The greens are a lot better today.   They were soft.   The course is in great shape, but with the greens being soft yesterday, the greens were pretty bumpy around the holes with the traffic being late in the tee times in the afternoon. 
Not that they're bad.   I felt like I hit a lot of good putts yesterday and was able to roll them in.   You could tell the difference on how the ball was hugging the ground this morning and tracking a bit better.

Q.   This is continued momentum and the confidence coming from after The Open Championship? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, definitely.   I haven't had my best these first two days, but to get something out of the rounds, and definitely something I did on Sunday in The Open Championship, I was able to get a lot out of that round, shooting 5 under on Sunday. 
It's just fun to kind of have a little bit of everything clicking.   It will be nice once it starts to really go.   I'll be able to kind of step on the gas and get after it a little bit more.

Q.   How does it feel to be in contention again even though you don't have your best the first couple of days? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Looking back at it yesterday and today to see what I can improve most and what I can tighten up a bit, then going into the weekend and see if I can keep getting a lot out of the rounds but also put myself in a position to not just shoot 3 under but have chances at shooting 5, 6, 7. 
It's out there as long as the wind doesn't pick up.   Drive the ball well around here, and you can definitely get some looks with the greens being soft.   You can get up some pins.   Looking forward to see if I can tighten the game up a little bit and have some fun this weekend.

Q.   I think you were 1 over through 10.   Did the 3 iron on 2 ignite something? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   I hit a good drive there.   A good swing there, good 3 iron in, and finally got one to go in the hole, finally made a putt, which was big. 
Started to string together some better swings, which made it a little easier.   I wasn't having to put any pressure on the putting as far as making par putts.   And then snuck a couple in on 7 and 8. 
So pretty stress free back nine.   Just probably nice to see some go in because I had probably‑‑ I had about four looks on my front nine go out inside 10 feet.   It's tough when those don't go in.

Q.   How do you attribute your ability to play a high level in the majors, rise to those occasions? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's been a big year as far as working on the preparation, working on the game the week leading up to the majors, going through kind of a checklist to make sure everything's where it's at, where I want it to be, or if there's something I need to work on, I can continue to work on in the tournament during the course of the play.
