 Q.  Rickie, you'll go into next week inside the top 5.  Obviously the biggest goal.  What does that mean to you?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I mean, I think that's the ultimate goal through the Playoffs is to be in the top 5 going into East Lake, to have a chance to win there and win it all.  With the way the game is right now, definitely a little bit of work that I need to put in, but really looking forward to having a good week next week.   
 Q.  What is the work you have to put in before Thursday?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Just need to tighten a few things up, make sure the driving is on point.  Been hitting my irons well, short game has been pretty good, and need to get the putter going again.  I've made some good putts, but I need to make more.
