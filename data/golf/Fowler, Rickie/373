  JOEL SCHUCHMANN:   We'd like to welcome Rickie Fowler to the interview room at the CIMB Classic.   Just some opening comments about coming to Malaysia and playing this golf course here. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's a long flight.   No, I'm happy to be here.   I've been here once to Malaysia, obviously a different course this year, but I really like the city and the surrounding area.   It's a fun place to come hang out, and it's a little warm and a long flight, but happy to be here and a nice way to start off the 2014 season.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:   With the new structure of the season, these are official events.   This is the first ever FedExCup event in Asia.   Maybe kind of talk about your season goals and obviously be nice to get off to a good start as you head into 2014. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, it's a little different starting the year now in October for 2014.   But I guess the way to look at it is just we're all out here trying to play well whenever we tee it up.   Not really looking at it as the start of the year or anything like that, just over here trying to play some good golf in Asia, on a threeâ€‘week trip playing here at CIMB, then HSBC and then going down to Australia for the Aussie PGA.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:   Any particular goals you have for the upcoming season? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, always the goal is to make it to the TOUR Championship through the FedExCup Playoffs.   I've only made it once, and I've played well, had one win two years ago now.   I would have said last year.   It wasn't, it was 2012.   And then Ryder Cup, as well.   There's a lot of things to set goals on, but I think those are probably two of my primary goals, and I would also like to get my second win out of the way. 

Q.   You've just played the course.   What would you say is the hardest hole do you reckon on the course, if you can remember?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I don't know if I can remember.   Let's see.   Yeah, I'm not sure.   It's a tough driving golf course because it's fairly narrow.   Putting the ball in the fairway is going to be key here this week.   It doesn't matter if it's an easy hole or a tough hole.   If you're in the rough it's going to make it a tough hole, even if you have a wedge in your hand.   You can get some pretty thick lies in the rough.   Yeah, any hole is going to be tough if you're not in the fairway. 

Q.   Just wondered if you'd been watching Rory McIlroy's season and his ups and downs, and do you think he's on the way back, and what do you think about his decision to change clubs? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   I think he'll be fine.   He's a great player and he's very talented.   I know he had a good finish last week.   Golf is a game of confidence.   When you get on a good roll and get things going, if he gets a few good finishes and gets momentum and confidence back on his side, he'll be fine.   I don't have any worries or doubts about him.   He had a tough year last year, and golf is a tough game.   There's a lot of unanswered questions.   You never know what's going to happen the next day, and it was unfortunate to see him struggle a bit, but probably I'm sure he learned quite a bit from the year, and he's going to be stronger moving forward. 
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:   Rickie Fowler, thank you.
