RICKIE FOWLER: Well, obviously you can't see the green there on 5, it's a blind shot.  From the right side of the tee box you can see the flag and where it's at.  I let it drift in with the wind.  Made a great swing and knew it had a chance to be good, because the numbers matched up.  Once you could see kind of where it landed, the crowd kind of started reacting and standing up.  I knew it was fairly close.  I'll have to check the highlights to see how close it was.
Q. (Inaudible.)
RICKIE FOWLER: Got a bad read.
Q. (Inaudible.)
RICKIE FOWLER: Not necessarily.  You kind of have to play your way around this being good.  And you have to stay out of trouble.  So it may be playing easier than normal.  But this golf course is still very tough.  You hit a shot off line, and you can make bogeys and others very quickly.  So definitely had a little more aggressive lines, but softer conditions, not much wind and just didn't really hit it close enough.  Hit some good putts, but just didn't make anything.
