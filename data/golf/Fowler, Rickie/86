 Q.  Ricky, a closing round of 68 for 14-under total.  Obviously not the victory you were hoping for, but sometimes you just have to tip your hat to Brandon Stone's 60 in the final round.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, like I said, going into the day someone else was going to have to go out and earn it and play a round of golf.  With how many guys we had kind of in the mix there.  Yeah, all you can do is tip your cap, congratulations, and he got it done.  That's the round of golf it took to get in, beat all these guys that were close to the top.   
 Q.  Off to Carnoustie now.  How well do you feel having played this week of links golf here?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I feel great.  Really looking forward to it.  We went over to Carnoustie on Tuesday to get a look at it.  I really like where the game's at.  We're over here, ready to go.  I feel like we've gotten some good, fair test, a little bit of wind, some days where it hasn't been too windy.  But I think it's been a successful week in getting ready for the Open.  Obviously it would have been nice to put up a little better round today and have a chance, but like you said, tip your cap to Brandon.   
 Q.  You mentioned Carnoustie.  What sort of setup have you seen over there?  What sort of challenges will you be facing next week?  
RICKIE FOWLER: It's very firm and fast.  The greens are probably going to dry out and be a little firmer and faster as the tournament week gets going.  But tee to green it's quick.  And it's going to be tough to stop the ball in the fairways.  So that's going to be a real challenge, especially when the winds start picking up and you have to really do a good job of holding shots with the wind when they do get across.  Or else the wind is just going to take it and the ball won't stop.   
 Q.  We look forward to seeing you there.
