 Q.   Who better than a man who has just walked off the course to tell us how difficult it is today?   Give us perspective how it's playing.   
RICKIE FOWLER:   The wind is a bit stronger than it has been but I wouldn't say any tougher than it has been throughout the week.   At least we are staying dry out there, not having to worry about showers coming through, big gusts of wind when they do come through.   It's a fair test.   It's tough.   You've got to hit some good golf shots and have control of your golf ball through the air.  
   
 Q.   What would you say is a realistic score for the leaders?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   I mean, it would be a very good round of golf if anyone got anywhere close to double digits.   Anything in red numbers is a great score out there.   I turned at 1‑over and made a couple mistakes but felt like I played fairly well.   
Made a few mistakes on the back nine.   But yeah, anything 70, 69, 68, and if SÃ¸ren were to do that out front, no one's going to get him I don't think.  
   
 Q.   Your first Irish Open, give us your perspective at the end of the week?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I had a great time.   Fans were awesome, at one of my favorite golf courses in the world.   
Really cool to be asked by a good friend, Rory, to come over and play and help support his foundation; with what he did and what his foundation did this week for the tournament and everything they are doing for children's cancer is pretty special.   So I'm happy to be a part of it and looking forward to doing more things together.
