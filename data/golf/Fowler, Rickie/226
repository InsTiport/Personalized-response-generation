RICKIE FOWLER: Had a couple bad breaks but that's going to happen.  I had some good breaks the first couple days.  Made a couple bad swings, but couldn't get the right reads.  Struggling on the greens.  Felt like I hit a lot of good putts.  Got the speed somewhat dialed in but yeah, just wasn't seeing them.  Obviously with nothing going in, it's hard to get any momentum or anything going from there.
Kind of fought through it.  Just hung in there.  Played well coming in to make some pars, especially in the Bear Trap.  It wasn't playing easy.  So all in all, with it being as bad as it was, I definitely didn't play as bad as I scored, and not out of it.
Q. Do you still feel like you're in it?  What do you have to do tomorrow?
RICKIE FOWLER: Oh, for sure.  Just a solid round of golf tomorrow and be in a good position.  Obviously I'm a little further than I would have liked to have been.  I would have liked to have been closer or possibly out front but both Adam and Sergio are playing really good out there.
Unfortunate for Adam to make the number he did on 15.  Just shows you how quickly it can kind of jump and get you.  I know he was playing really well, obviously hitting his numbers and hitting good shots.  And I felt like I was doing a lot of the same.  Like I said, nothing was going in.  I'm sure he was rolling some putts in.  But it's a fine line out here, especially at this course.  You can shoot 4-over a lot quicker than you can shoot 4-under.
Q. When you look at chasing, is this venue different in that it has such big swings coming down the stretch?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, you can go play the last four, five holes and you can play them 2-, 3-under and you can make up five, six shots.  But that's depending on what you do and what the other guy does.  And you're never wishing bad on anyone, but yeah, if you play some good golf you can make up some ground here.
Q. How tough was it putting today?  Didn't seem like you could get anything.
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, just feel and eyes, just seeing lines was off.  I feel like I've been seeing them well.  I made a few putts at the end of yesterday.  Just couldn't really get anything going today.
