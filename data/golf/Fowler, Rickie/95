 Q.  Rickie, six birdies today, I think.  Just comments on your round today.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it was nice.  Nice to -- like the boys said, for all of us to kind of make a few more putts and feed off each other.  Yesterday was a bit slow and we would have liked to have gotten off to a better start.  But nice to get inside that cut number and at least give yourselves some more sleep for the weekend.   
 Q.  Why did you slow down your two playing companions today?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Well, I'm a true competitor.  I didn't want JT or yourself to get a leg up on me, so didn't really work.  You beat me and I tied JT, so hopefully I get to play with JT tomorrow.  It's 50/50.   
 Q.  Sounds like you guys had lot of fun in here, but what was it like out on the golf course when you're all playing together?  
RICKIE FOWLER: It is fun.  We played quite a bit together.  Patrick and I played junior golf together and Amateur golf and college golf.  And JT and I probably spend too much time together.  He lives down the street and we travel and play and practice at home and we'll all share houses on the road.  So we had a good time out there.  It's always fun playing with your buds.   
 Q.  What happened on 11?  Did you get a mud ball, did the wind switch, or what happened?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I wish I could say any one of those.  It was just a really bad gap wedge, hit in the bunker and it was great to see Tiger a little closer, I was a little further back.  It was great to see him make it after I made it a debacle of the hole.  So good for him.
