  Q. What a bounceback for you; you bounced back in a big way with an eagle on your 54th hole. Tell me about it.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I got a couple rough lies on 7 and 8 with some chips and a couple rough bogeys. It was nice to come back. I had a good yardage and hit a great wedge shot.  
  
  Q. It put you right back in this tournament.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, today I thought we were going to get enough holes in, but at least we can get out, hopefully get off to a good start and put myself in position to come out tomorrow morning.  
  
  Q. You've got a quick turnaround. Do you have time for an Oklahoma State orange change?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I think that's going to be tomorrow. I think I'm just going to have time to throw some food down real quick, chug some water and go to the tee.
