 Q.  Lots of players were going down the leaderboard as opposed to going up the leaderboard.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it was tough to move up.  You saw some guys early post some numbers which is great playing in the conditions for the most part.   
Yeah, I wanted to continue to give myself a chance to be in this and have a chance to win tomorrow.  So it wasn't really a chance to make a lot of birdies out there.  You just had to kind of fight through.  Pars were good.   
It was tough to make some short putts out there just with the wind blowing and gusting.  When you start getting wind blowing with the break, they break quite a bit and when they go against it, it's tough to trust the reads and that the wind is going to affect it that much.   
 Q.  Is it tougher mentally when the conditions are like this out there?  
RICKIE FOWLER: It is.  You have to trust the wind and how it's going to affect it, how you're planning it and then actually execute the shot on top of that.  I felt like tee to green I played well.  I made a couple swings that put me in some tough spots.  But other than that, a few more putts go in, it's a solid round of golf.   
 Q.  A few shots back, nicely placed, how do you feel you can chase on this golf course?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I'm looking forward to it.  I'm driving well and getting the ball in position off the tee is key out here.  Get a couple of putts go in tomorrow and we'll have chance of moving up that board.
