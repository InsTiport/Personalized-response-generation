 Q.  After your round one performance, how much better was that in round two?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Felt a lot more comfortable out there second round.  Nice to drive it well.  Some better iron shots.  Made a few putts.  So see if we can continue to clean things up and make some more birdies over the weekend.   
 Q.  And obviously having to fight delays for these past couple of days, how much more difficult does it make it to keep momentum?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Well, yesterday was nice.  Got to kind of relax at the hotel and beach for a little bit in the morning.  Today, having the delay in the morning after a quick turnaround from last night, a bit tough, but yeah, it was unfortunate.  I felt like I had it kind of going a little bit yesterday, swinging well.   
Luckily was able to kind of pick back up after a little mistake at the first, making bogey.  But made a couple birdies coming in.  Get some food and get back at it this afternoon.   
 Q.  And just a few words on that excitement to play in a group like you have done the last couple of days?  
RICKIE FOWLER: It's been a lot of fun.  It's kind of a dream threesome to be playing along with two of my good friends out here and they happen to be the two best players in the world at the moment.  Had a lot of fun.   
Jordan didn't play as well as he would liked to.  Great to see him at least get in the weekend.  He won't stay there long.  He'll be moving up the board.  Rory hit some great shots coming in.  So it's motivating for all of us to kind of be with each other I think, kind of push each other along and get the best out of each other.
