  Q. Bogey-free, 7-under 64, in position to win your first PGA TOUR event heading into the weekend. All in all, a good day.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. You know, we're kind of right where we want to be.   
 Obviously making the cut is kind of the first step to winning a tournament. So we're in good position going into the weekend. It would have been nice to play the par-5s a little bit better today, but all in all a good run.  
  
  Q. Yeah, you made pars at the 9th and then at 13. But you scared eagle at the 16th, our Kodak Challenge hole.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I was trying to get a little run there, which we did. It would have been nice to send Troy a text after the round. I'm sure he would have found out before that. So we were definitely trying to make it there.  
  
  Q. The course, the greens are so receptive, they lend itself to aggressive play.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. There's obviously a few places that you can't hit it around some of the greens. Other than that, it doesn't matter what you have in your hand, you can really stay aggressive and give yourself a chance to make a lot of good birdies.  
  
  Q. Have a good weekend.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Thanks.
