Q. Not the result you all wanted, but you did keep clawing back.  Sum up what today was like.
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I mean, I was going out, trying to go win my point.  I didn't have kind of the game I've had the last few weeks, and the couple days leading in I felt like I was in a really good spot, and just struggled piecing things together.  Tried to dig deep as much as I could anytime I played, and especially today.  And knew it was going to be tough to get Sergio.
So, yeah, just tried to keep moving forward, fighting.  Gave him a couple holes, he gave me one there towards the end.  But just needed a few more putts to go in.
Q. Motivation going forward now for the team?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I mean, obviously we never want to put ourselves in that big of a hole or be that far back, but we felt good about our chances come in today.  Some of the guys out front went and did what they needed to do.  I needed to do a better job on the back end.
We gave ourselves a chance.  We knew it was going to be tough today, but we were up for the challenge.  So, yeah, a little bummed out I wasn't able to get my point; still, it's a great week.
