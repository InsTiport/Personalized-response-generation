RICKIE FOWLER: We had a lot of fun out there and it was pretty up and down all day. I thought I was in a good position on 16, but Scott pulled off a great up-and-down and then won 17. I thought I hit a good putt there on 18, but it was just a little too hard and didn't break.  Then Scott kindly slid his putt past and gave me a half.  Obviously you want to win, but a tie is probably a fair result today.
