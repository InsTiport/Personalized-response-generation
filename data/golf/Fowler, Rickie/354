STEVE SANDS: Ricky Fowler who shot a third round 67.  There are a couple players on the golf course under par as we speak, but you're the only one who has carded an under par score today.  How were you able to do it?RICKIE FOWLER: Well, first of all, I'm happy to be under par.  It was a grind out there today.  I didn't hit it as well as I would like to.  I drove it a little bit poorly and definitely need some work on that tomorrow with Butch before we go out.  But I hit a lot of great shots into the greens and I got the ball up-and-down when I needed to.STEVE SANDS: Speaking of Butch, we were talking earlier in the week, you and Butch, and you guys have been working together since December.  We were talking about it a little bit earlier on the show.  He said it's the best he's seen you hit it since the two of you have been working together.  Are you as comfortable as Butch is with the way you're hitting the ball right now.RICKIE FOWLER: I am.  I drove it really well on Thursday.  Unfortunately, the last two days kind of got away from me, but iron play has been spot on most of the time.  I hit a couple bad swings here and there, which is going to happen, but other than that I've been really hitting my lines and actually positioning the ball on the green where I've been trying to.  So it's always nice when you look up and see the ball going the right direction.STEVE SANDS: In round one you had a special look.  Take a look at the monitor right here in front of you.  You were wearing the knickers, the plus fours, paying homage to Payne Stewart.  What did it mean to you to look like that, to feel like that, and to pay homage to Payne.RICKIE FOWLER: It was awesome to be able to come out here and wear the knickers in honor of Payne.  It was very special.  I sent a message to Chelsea Stewart afterwards and said, I hope you guys liked it as much as I did, because it was a lot of fun walking around with her dad that day.  It was definitely special.STEVE SANDS: And you looked good in it.  Thanks.RICKIE FOWLER: Thanks.
