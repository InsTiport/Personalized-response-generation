 Q.  Rickie, happy, frustrated or satisfied with today?  RICKIE FOWLER: I think everything.  Little frustrated with a couple mistakes that I made out there today but excited about where I'm at.  Obviously great tournament here this week.  Quicken Loans has done a good job for us.  It's fun.  Having a good time out there.  In a position where I can go in tomorrow.  Yeah, put everything behind us and got 18 holes in front of us.   Q.  I got the impression you were frustrated with your putting.  You look at the numbers, you made 131 feet of putts, however 70 of that came on the 4th.  You could have made one of those putts at 12 and 13.  RICKIE FOWLER: I had some good looks.  The bonus, the 70 footer is a bonus.  That's one you're just hoping to two-putt and stay away from making bogey. And so little luck there and -- but, yeah, other than that, I had some good looks and, like I said, there were two swings, par 3 on the back started out, No. 11, and then on 17, just bad swing at the wrong time.  We'll get rid of those for tomorrow and have a clean round and see if we can get the job done.   Q.  You'll be in the penultimate group.  Your PGA TOUR wins have come from behind.  RICKIE FOWLER: I'm looking forward to being out in front and making some noise, see if we can chase the guys down early and get things going.   Q.  Were you satisfied with today?  RICKIE FOWLER: Not quite.  I was a little sloppy at times.  I made a couple mistakes I wish I didn't but, other than that, one shot back going into Sunday and have 18 holes in front of us.   Q.  What were you dissatisfied with?  RICKIE FOWLER: I missed a few putts that I thought I had good looks at and the swing on 11 and the shot on 17 definitely cost me two shots there, maybe three if I birdie one of them. The par 3 11th is tough.  Trying to make 3 and get out of there.  I had a good number on 17 and just made a bad swing.  Got those out of the way and there's tomorrow.   Q.  As for tomorrow, talk about Kevin Chappell.  Concentrated leaderboard.  Another shoot-out.  RICKIE FOWLER: Really go about it like the last three days.  Very similar conditions from the sounds of it.  Yeah, going to be a lot of birdies out there. Got to kind of keep pace and really got to be ready to go out and get off to a good, solid start.  Got off to a little bit better start today than I have the last couple days.  Do a little bit more
