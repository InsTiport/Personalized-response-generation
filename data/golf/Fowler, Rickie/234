A flash interview with:   
RICKIE FOWLER   
 Q.  Tell us about regulation and this one.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Actually coming into the last two, I had a two-shot lead and thought if I make 3 here I feel like I go to the last with a two-shot lead.  Great.   
Both my caddie and I thought that driver would be perfect, just hit a little cut driver.  I hit a perfect shot.  Kind of got a little bit of bad break, landed on the downslope and it goes I think an extra 60 yards from where it landed in the water.  We ended up making bogey.   
That was a little unfortunate.  Kind of ruined the game plan coming in.  I felt like I made a lot of good swings that back 9, so this one hurts a little.   
 Q.  What do you take from this?  It's got to hurt.  You played awfully, awfully well this week.  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I didn't putt as well as I'd like to the last three days, but I feel like I handled myself well out there and controlled things well today.  Made some really good swings.   
I take a lot of positives from this.  We'll be back soon.  Don't worry.
