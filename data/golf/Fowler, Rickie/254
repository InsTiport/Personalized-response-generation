Q. You started off pretty strong with a couple of birdies and then you ran into 17, which is giving a lot of guys trouble.  What happened there?
RICKIE FOWLER: I just made a bad swing.  I didn't hit my irons and wedges very well today, so yeah.  I mean, I made a couple birdies today, which was nice, but I wasn't able to hit my scoring clubs the way I wanted to.
Q. Is 17 a particularly tough holes or are guys just not putting good swings on that as a coincidence?
RICKIE FOWLER: A little bit of both.  It can be visually intimidated.  It's a tough hole out here.  It was playing shorter today.  It wasn't playing very tough by any means.  You just had to hit a 7-iron out right of the hole.  You can't hit it left.  I hit it left.  I saw two guys behind me, Hunter and Brooks, both hit it left of the pin.  Brooks's ball stayed up, Hunter's ball went in the water, and it was a little tough playing out of the water.
Q. What do you need to do tomorrow to sort of get yourself back into contention?
RICKIE FOWLER: Make sure I can get into the weekend.  I think as long as we do that, anything can happen over the weekend.  There's some low rounds out here.  Be nice to go get a good, solid round, anything 4, 5 or more under --
Q. Are you overall displeased or are you okay with your round today?
RICKIE FOWLER: Today?  I thought it was horrible.
