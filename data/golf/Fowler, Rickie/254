 Q.  How would you describe your overall experience in Vegas?  
RICKIE FOWLER: It's been a fun week.  It was nice being back, a lot of positives coming out of the golf side, and got some stuff to clean up, but yeah, definitely enjoyed it.  Had some good fans out this week.  Would have been nice to play a little bit better, but enjoyed the time.   
 Q.  You said there's a lot of fans, as you know, lots of little Rickie Fowlers out here, obviously a big community following you.  How does that make you feel?  
RICKIE FOWLER: It's awesome.  Anywhere I go, it feels like I have a great support group, great fans, young, middle aged, older.  It's awesome.  To be able to have that, feel that support out there when I'm playing, it's special to be in that position, but to always have that, it's something that kind of picks you up if you're having a down day and keeps you up when you are playing well.  Hopefully I'll be able to be back soon and see if we can play a little bit better.
