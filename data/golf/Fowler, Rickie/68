Q. Final round 65 for you today; how did that happen for you out there?  What were you seeing on the course?
RICKIE FOWLER: Great pairing with Jason Day.  What could go wrong?  We had a good time out there.  Nice way to finish off the week.  Haven't felt quite that well the last few days, so nice to kind of gut it out in the heat and finish off the tournament.  I'm pleased with how I've played Philly and bookend 65s here at TOUR Championship.  Looking forward to getting some rest tonight and tomorrow when we get to Paris and getting ready for Ryder Cup.
Q. What's on the itinerary there?
RICKIE FOWLER: I think we're supposed to take off around 10:00 tonight and scheduled to land kind of midday in Paris.  I doubt there will be a whole lot of golf tomorrow with some of the schedule, and I know we have, I think, a dinner maybe by 6:00 or so.  It'll be an off day, so rest up on the plane, and it'll be a busy week over there, but they're some of the best weeks of the year.
