 Q. All right, Rickie. Everybody has to know, I have to know, the tee shot at 17. A little bit left. Very aggressive. A little bit left. Where were you trying to hit that one?
 RICKIE FOWLER: Probably 20 yards right of that. I definitely pulled it. But from the tee on the left side there, it actually gives you some room left with the line I was taking, and just I got a bit lucky that it snuck through the trees there. 
 You know, worst case we probably would have had a low shot that we would have had to run up. But got through, got in the first cut and made birdie. 

 Q. How good does it feel? You got the birdie out of your way. Now a three-way tie for the lead with two rounds left. Your first attempt at it, too. You don't have to sweat it out the rest of the week. How good does that feel?
 RICKIE FOWLER: Well, I think we'll try and get some looks at two, but I know that's a big long shot.
 You know, I played well for 27 holes. The front nine today was a little rough, but I'm focusing on trying to go win a golf tournament now. You know, we'll see how the Kodak thing works out, and Troy can still have hopefully some looks at birdies this weekend. I know he's close to the cut line, but you know, comes down to a playoff, I think we'll have a lot of fun.

 Q. Way to battle back today, a round that could have gotten away from you. Good grinding, and good luck this weekend. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Thank you.
