Q.   What inspired you to throw the hat party there on 16?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Same thing we did last year.   16 is obviously a fun hole.   I love it.   The fans are great there, and it was cool to pump them up and nice to be able to get out some Puma gear.

Q.   So the numerous hats on your head didn't affect the game at all?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I hit a good shot and made a good putt, so it seemed to work out all right.

Q.   Are you going to do that moving forward?   That worked out all right for you. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, it was kind of‑‑ I thought of that about a hole or two before, just kind of figured out I needed to come out maybe with something.   I've got the hats, might as well throw them all on my head.

Q.   Talk about your thoughts. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Not exactly pleased.   Had a lot of fun.   16 was definitely the highlight of the day, and really looking forward to getting out tomorrow.   I've been hitting the ball well and made a couple putts today but just haven't really pieced it all together yet.

Q.   What do you need to do tomorrow? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   I mean, I guess Spence is going to have to come back a little bit.   He's a little bit out of reach right now with a really good round.   He's in control of the tournament.   He's obviously playing well.   We'll see what he does down the stretch today.   And going into tomorrow, there's a lot of birdies out here, so we'll see if we can make a run and try and get a good finish out of the week.

Q.   Can you get five hats on 16 tomorrow?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, I really just planned for today, so not sure if I'll be doing anything tomorrow at 16.
