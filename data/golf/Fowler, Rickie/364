Q.   Can we get some feedback on what's been a great week for you?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, like you said, great week.   I had obviously some great wins over a lot of great players, and lost to Jason, would have been nice to get that one.   He's playing well, as you can see on the 18th. 
Ernie was tough this afternoon.   I know he hadn't been putting up the scores this week.   Today he came out and played pretty solidly.
I made like five birdies and like four birdies and two eagles or something against him, something like that.   So I had to make some low numbers to beat him and good birdie on No.1, 19th hole to win the match.

Q.   This gets you into Doral in a couple of weeks time.   How nice is it to be going back there?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I was kind of planning on it in the beginning of the year, and three missed cuts, drops you in the world rankings pretty quickly.   I think I got back to 56 or so coming into this week.   I knew my game was in a good position, just hadn't been showing making cuts.   It probably looked a lot worse than it did.   Good to get on a roll and get some momentum being built up.

Q.   You have the new Blue Monster there?
RICKIE FOWLER:   The new Blue Monster, I've heard good things about it.   I'm excited to get down there.   It's always fun to play WGCs.
