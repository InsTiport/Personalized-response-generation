  Q. Rickie, you had played here last year, but this is still one of these courses that you really kind of have to learn your way around. You obviously are learning quick.  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. No, I mean we only got two rounds in last year because we missed the cut, but other than yesterday, I had two doubles, other than that, we played okay, I guess, and came out today.   
 And actually, swinging it quite bad with driver throughout the day, and you know, managed to get it around, and you know, squeeze it in some fairways and give myself some looks, so it was nice to be able to get some birdies going and get everything going in the right direction.  
  
  Q. You had a chance for 64 there until the bogey at 18. Still 65's great. How about tell me about the hole-out at 2.  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Hole-out at 2, I hit 81 yards. The pin was tucked behind the bunker, and the green kind of all slopes right to the pin there; and my caddie there told me right before I hit it, he said, give it a chance to go in. So listened pretty well, I guess.  
  
  Q. Yeah. You need to listen to him more often. That's pretty well done. Playing with Scotty and with Jay, Scotty called himself a veteran; Jay called himself an old man, but how much fun was that today? They had fun, I know that.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. I had a lot of fun with those guys and their caddies as well. Great guys, and I think we all kind of fed off each other today. They played a little bit better than I did yesterday, and it was nice to get the three of us playing decent today and make some birdies; and hopefully we can go on and play well this weekend.  
  
  Q. You know, I think folks don't know that about you. You have almost as much fun with the caddies as you do with the other players. Most of the pros, the guys who've been around a long time, they kind of go off by themselves or talk to each other when they're playing. You have as much fun with the other guys' caddies and with your caddie as you do with the other players.  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Oh, yeah. I'll pretty much hang out and talk to whoever.  
  
  Q. Talk to the wall if it takes it, huh?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: There you go. If it's there.   
  
  Q. Good luck to you this weekend. Anything you're going to try to straighten out, the driver between now and tomorrow?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: I think we'll leave it alone until tomorrow morning or whatever, but go get some food, get some rest, get a workout in, and you know, we'll sleep it off. It'll straighten itself out.  
  
  Q. 6:50 was early this morning, wasn't it?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah. I showed up here at 4:45. But it was an early wakeup call.  
  
  Q. Go get 'em, man.
