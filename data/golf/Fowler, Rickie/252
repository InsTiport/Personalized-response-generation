Q. That was as crazy a last four holes and I've seen from anybody.  What were you feeling as you were going through these ups and downs?
RICKIE FOWLER: It was a little irritating.  16 and 17 cost me a lot of shots this week.  It would be nice to possibly get some back there.  I haven't made particularly bad swings, just hit it kind of the wrong directions at the wrong time.
Q. Were you just taking a shot at that pin on 16 or just trying to get it on the green and it got away from you?
RICKIE FOWLER: 16 just started further right than I wanted it to, and really the most I've seen a ball move in the air this week.  Yeah, just bad mistake more than anything.  It's just a little irritating.
Q. Are you aware of what happened in Stillwater this morning?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I saw some of the news.  I don't have many of the details.  I haven't heard from many people back in Stillwater as of now.
Q. Any emotions about it, having gone to the homecoming parade a couple times?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it's very tragic.  Like I said, I haven't gotten the details on it, just the gist of it.
Q. Three dead, 22 wounded.
RICKIE FOWLER: Mm-hmm.  Those are some of the things that I've seen, but hoping to get filled in on it a little bit more.
Q. Were you aware of it when you teed off?
RICKIE FOWLER: I had heard that there was an accident.  I didn't have any details.
Q. Now you're hearing more about it?
RICKIE FOWLER: Getting more and more.  I just got off the course so I don't have much more than that.
Q. It didn't impact your play at all?
RICKIE FOWLER: I heard there was an accident but I didn't have details.
