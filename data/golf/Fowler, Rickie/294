  RICKIE FOWLER: I've been waiting a long time for this.  Back in the winner's circle.  Thank you, everyone, for being here.  Happy Mother's Day.  Happy Mother's Day to my mom -- my mom and sister were actually at the airport, checked in, and made their way back, so I made it worth their while. And to my girlfriend Alexis, thank you for all your support and for being here. Thank you to all the volunteers, everyone at the PGA TOUR.  This is now my favorite event of the year.  (Laughter.) It hasn't sunk in yet, and I'm sure it won't sink in for a while. That finish was pretty fun.  Went up against two great guys in a playoff, obviously two great players.  Kis has been playing very well, Sergio, he's no stranger, and I look forward to being back here and having another chance at winning.  Thank you.Q. What was it like coming down the stretch in regulation and also in the aggregate playoff and then the extra playoff hole?RICKIE FOWLER: Well, I mean, I was quite a ways out of it going into No. 12, really.  That was really probably the biggest turning point for me.  I had an awkward lie in the fairway bunker and just tried to hit a shot and it worked out, made par, and really got moving from there, birdieing 13.  I knew after, let's see, 14, I made a great shot to make 4 there.  That was well from the right rough. The last four holes, I said, let's try and birdie the last four, so I one-upped myself.Q. You came so close at the major championships last year.  You've been so close here at THE PLAYERS.  How much does it help getting over the hump at a championship of this stature?RICKIE FOWLER: Well, this was a little different as far as, like I said, I was a little ways out of it, and the other ones I was kind of hanging around and wasn't able to get the job done. The one I look back to was the PGA Championship, and being in those positions definitely helped me, with where I was the last few holes actually back after the eagle at 16 and getting myself into the playoff, it was a lot of fun.  I felt very comfortable, made some -- obviously I didn't drive it well off 16, the first playoff hole, but from there on in, I played 17 and 18 amazing this week.  Those are not two easy holes, and I made a bunch of birdies on 17 and I hit some stellar drives on 18, which doesn't happen often.
