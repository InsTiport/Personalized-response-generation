 Q.  Rickie, shall we start at 16, because that was very nice to put you right into the mix.  RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, 16 was great.  Hit a drive where I wanted to up the left side, staying away from the bunkers, and hit a nice little 3-wood in there.  Put myself in a good position really just trying to make four and move on.  Tough to make a putt on that green, really from close range, too.  There's a lot of movement there.  Perfect speed, perfect line, and went right in the middle.   Q.  On what has been a tricky day with the winds up.  RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, the winds were a bit gusty today and even the constant wind was still pretty good.  Had to be aware of that.  There was some big crosswind holes into the wind downwind, so didn't play easy out there.  Especially the first hole starting out in off the left up the hill, not the easiest starting hole.  It was a good test out there.  Enjoyed it, pleased with the round and looking forward to tomorrow.   Q.  I know we touched on this prior to the championship where the balance lies with this tournament and then preparations for The Open.  I take it now that you're in this position, it's purely focused on this?  RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I think one of the goals coming in was to get ready for next week, but to put myself in contention, so the juices are ready for next week, as well.  We are right there, exactly where we want to be.  So go out tomorrow, get off to a good, solid start, stick to the same game plan and keep playing well and see if we can bring it home.   Q.  How instrumental was it seeing Mickelson win The Scottish Open and winning at Muirfield; how instrumental was that in your decision to come over and do the two?  RICKIE FOWLER: Seeing what he did a couple years ago and my decision to come over last year and this year, as well, it definitely makes sense to possibly play over here the week before and get acclimated and also play on a links golf course to get used to getting possibly the game ready and just getting a few things straightened out the week prior. So definitely had an influence last year on the way I played.  Had a good finish at The Scottish Open and went on to finish runner-up with Sergio at The Open and we are off to a good start this week, as well.   Q.  Any sense of what's needed for a good finish?  RICKIE FOWLER: Weather depending.  Depends what we get tomorrow.  Another good round like I had today, and I think we'll have a fun afternoon tomorrow.  But a lot of guys in the middle of it, so going to have to play well.
