 Q.  How do you feel like you played the first two days?  RICKIE FOWLER: First two days I got absolutely nothing out of it.  Couldn't hit the ball any better tee to green.  I would have put myself up against pretty much anyone here, and just couldn't get the ball in the hole.  Kind of frustrating when you go out and hit the ball that well and just, like I said, got absolutely nothing out of it, so it was nice to make some putts today, continue to swing it well.  One bogey.  It would have been nice to go with a clean card, but good, solid day, and put myself back in a good position.   Q.  Did you identify anything in your putting?  RICKIE FOWLER: No.  It seemed like my speed wasn't dialed in, which today was a lot better, other than 17.  I ran one by from long distance, but I just trusted it a little bit more today, made one putt and kind of went from there.  The first two rounds, Thursday and Friday, it seemed like I'd get the read right and speed was off, or I'd get the read wrong and speed was good.  So just a bad combination, and then you get it going the wrong way in the wind, and it's tough to really build confidence.  Actually it was nice to get a couple today early and then get going.   Q.  Does 17 feel like a par-5 to you?  RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, for the most part.  Just because how tough the second shot is, and the drive, as well.  I made 4 there probably when it played its hardest, and then I've bogeyed it my last two rounds when I had probably the easier shots in, into the easier pins.  Today I had -- I tried to just carry one on top, just not bring in long or right into play, and just didn't get as much help as I wanted to, pitched into the slope and just came back, so I had a tough two-putt, but made two perfect swings.  I hit a great drive and a great 7-iron and ended up walking away with a bogey, so that was kind of a little bit of a bummer.  Like I said, I wanted to go clean, and nice to finish it off with a birdie at least.   Q.  How low do you think guys can go this afternoon if conditions stay the same?  RICKIE FOWLER: If they stay the same -- we really only had a few holes where it picked up and there was some rain.  Other than that, there was some good scoring conditions out there.  Leish got 8.  I mean, it's out there right now, 5 to 8, and there's possibilities of going lower if someone really gets it going.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  RICKIE FOWLER: When I made -- I started off slow.  I made pars at the first two, which are fairly easy holes, but I finally made a putt on 3 and made a good putt on 4 and then got it going from there.  Yeah, started to feel a little bit more confidence with the putter after 4.   Q.  Do you feel with golfing so many years now, is there a feeling you can get some confidence going now if you get some good breaks?  RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, really it can be one swing or one putt, and it can turn a lot of things around.  It took me two because I had missed a lot the first two rounds, so once I got two to go in, then it kind of went from there.   Q.  What did you do yesterday?  RICKIE FOWLER: Slept in a little bit, ate over here at the club, and then kind of relaxed for the day, got a workout in, went into town, had dinner, and nothing crazy.   Q.  Did you have to change your travel plans?  RICKIE FOWLER: No, I was actually scheduled to fly out Tuesday morning anyways, so really everything was already in place, so it worked out to be a blessing in disguise.   Q.  There's still a lot of golfers to go out.  Talk about your situation going into the final round?  RICKIE FOWLER: I feel really good.  I've really just got to hope that no one really runs away for me to have a chance.  If conditions stay the same, then I hope that, like I said, no one really takes off, and tomorrow I'll have to put up a really good round to have a chance.   Q.  Clearly Rory not being here, you, Rory and Sergio were kind of the big three last year in the championship.  Your final round, you played pretty well in terms of your putting.  You didn't miss many inside of five feet.  How important is that, short putting at The Open Championship this time around?  RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, making putts is huge.  Luckily I've made a lot of my short putts.  It's really just been making the ones that kind of change momentum and get stuff going.  I putted well today, but yeah, at a major, if you want to be in contention, you need to be making almost everything inside 10 feet.  When you aren't, it puts a lot of stress on the ball-striking.  It can be done not making putts, but you'd better be hitting it well.   Q.  Is it unique that you and Sergio are still very much part of this narrative this Open?  RICKIE FOWLER: I don't think it's a surprise by any means.  I'm coming off of a great week last week and I love playing over here.  I've had success here at St. Andrews, and Sergio is one of the best players in the world.  He's got a great game for links golf, and he's played a few Opens here.  I know he feels comfortable around here, and I know we're both trying to do the same thing.
