Q.   You've given everything there is to be in that semifinal.   Give us your thoughts on that one. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   You know, I knew Jason was going to be tough.   We had a good time out there today.   We're good buddies.   He was tough to beat.   He made quite a few good putts.   He didn't give me a whole lot as far as giving holes.   He gave me putts.   He's a good guy. 
9, he gave me one there and missed a par putt on 12, but other than that he played solid all day. 
15, I was in a tough position.   I couldn't really make anything of it.
16, just a complete misread.   Hit a good putt but when you misread, it's not going to have a chance. 
Like I said, Jason played well, he played solid.   He's going to be tough to beat this afternoon for whoever has him in the finals. 
Take a lot out of this week.   Got a lot of confidence, got some good wins.   Go out this afternoon and see if we can get a little practice in and see if we can get one more match win and move on to next week.

Q.   How big a step in the right direction has this week before for you?
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's been huge.   I've been swinging really well.   I've been telling people tee to green I've been awesome.   The things with Butch that we've been working on have been paying off.   Just haven't really been making any putts and getting the balls up and down when we need to.   Just continue to have momentum and the rhythm throughout a round.   This week I was able to accomplish a few things with the putter and the short game.   Yeah, just kind of finally the things are starting to click, and I think the miscuts that I had were not because of ball striking.   It was just a little bit of tough go as far as continuing to have momentum through the round.   Like said, we had it this week.
