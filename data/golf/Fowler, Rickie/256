Q. Just your thoughts about the match.  Adam seemed to play a little bit better than you to run away with it?
RICKIE FOWLER: Probably more than a little better.  I didn't play very well today.  I wasn't able to make any putts.  Didn't get off to a great start, so Adam is playing well, he made some putts.  I can't go out and expect to win a match over par.
Q. Conditions were quite tough out there?
RICKIE FOWLER: Condition were still scorable.  Just needed to be in the fairway.  I hit a couple drives that weren't my best, but yeah, it was tough but still needed to make birdies to win holes.
Q. Was there a key moment there where you felt you should have stuck with him before he sort of got a way a little bit?
RICKIE FOWLER: I knew the putt I had on 8, the par 3, I felt like it was one that I needed to make.  I felt like I hit a good putt and it just missed.  I felt like it was one if I made, he may miss.  It is very makeable.  It was kind of down in the trough, that back pin there; I missed and he made and things went his way.  He continued to make some birdies from there.  It was kind of, I would say the turning point right in there.
