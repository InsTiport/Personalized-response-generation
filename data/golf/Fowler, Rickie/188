Q. Thoughts on how things played out today?
RICKIE FOWLER: Disappointing back nine.  I didn't drive it the way I needed to.  It was just a little off here and there.  You had to be playing out of the fairway.  So yeah, very disappointing.  Not the way I've been playing the back nine all week.  Coming to the last eight holes, I made one bogey through the week.  I don't know, like I said, just made a couple bad swings at the wrong time.
Q. What happened at 15 and 16?
RICKIE FOWLER: 15, I felt really good with the drive.  I just caught it off the heel and the ball started left and wasn't coming back.  I was trying to start it up the left and just have it fall right.  Once it starts off left, it's in a bad spot.
16, I was trying to hit one up the left side of the green and the ball just squirted right out of the rough.  Not a very tough bunker shot but just a little bit more sand than I was expecting and ended up walking away with double.
Yeah, I mean, a missed putt on 15 -- something I've been getting up-and-down all week on 16.  So 15, 16, yeah, go par, par, there, it's a little different story.
Q. Were you aware of the Ryder Cups implications as far as where you are on the leaderboard coming in the last two, three holes?
RICKIE FOWLER: I mean, I'm just trying to win the tournament really.  If I win, then it takes care of both things.  Obviously once Patrick got a little bit of a cushion, I still wanted to get the best finish I can.  Nice to make the swing I did on 17 after making double on 16.
So to make two there was nice.  And then it was a little loud up there on 18 tee.  Didn't make the swing that I should have off the tee, but disappointing finish.  I mean, it will hurt, but it's only going to make it better for next week.  I'll be in a good spot.
