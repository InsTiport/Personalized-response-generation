Q.   (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER:   Biggest thing for me today was finally taking advantage of the par‑5s.   I really hadn't done that the first couple days.   Yesterday I made two bogeys on the par‑5s, which I was green side on one of them and 3‑putted another. 
Today I was able to make four birdies there.   I had two, 2‑putt birdies.   Just makes the round a lot easier when you're able to take advantage of the par‑5s.

Q.   (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER:   It feels good to get a solid round in.   The greens were a little bit softer today.   Compared to yesterday afternoon.   So it gave us the opportunity to get close to a few pins and hold some greens on the par‑5s. 
I played solidly today.   I made a great par on 11, which kind of kept my round going.   I was able to take advantage of the par‑5s from there, 13 and 15. 
So it would have been nice to get the putt to go on 18, but definitely solid round today.

Q.   (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER:   It is.   Depends on what the guys do coming in.   Depending upon where I'm at and how much ground I do have to make up.   But good position and feeling good about tomorrow. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER:   Thursday it was just a little off.   I didn't drive it great.   I drove it really well yesterday and drove it okay today.   Definitely better than I did on Thursday. 
So the biggest thing was actually taking advantage of some of those and taking advantage of the par‑5s.   So if I can piece together the driving a little bit better tomorrow, it will make things a lot easier.   Because playing from the trees is not easy out here.   The short grass definitely gives you the ability to control your golf ball. 

Q.   Are these perfect conditions for low scores?
RICKIE FOWLER:   The golf course isn't playing easy, so there were scores out there today, but you had to be in control of your golf ball.   The greens are still firm and fast and it's tough to go around without making very many mistakes. 
So I'm definitely pleased with the round I put together.   The wind has died down and definitely playing easier today than it has the first two.

Q.   (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER:   Oh, yeah, orange and green look great together.   I think green would look great with anything, to be honest.
