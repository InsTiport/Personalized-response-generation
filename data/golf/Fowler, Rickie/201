RICKIE FOWLER: I hit two shots.
Q. Is that a bad thing, a good thing to have gotten started and then have the long day?
RICKIE FOWLER: Unfortunately I feel like I've been swinging really well the last couple days and had a really good warm-up this afternoon, so I was looking forward to getting out there and getting after it.
Obviously weather through the summer we always deal with and you play when you get to play.  So go back, rest up, get some food in and be back out early tomorrow morning.
Q. What's the plan for tomorrow and how does your mind-set change at all?
RICKIE FOWLER: Same thing.  Like I said, I've been swinging well this week.  I was looking forward to getting out there today.  We're probably only going to get a limited amount of holes, as well.  I know there's some storms, as well, expected tomorrow afternoon.  Like I said, play when we get to play and go from there.
