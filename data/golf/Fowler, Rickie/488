 Q. Rickie, another ruling this year that came to the forefront at the fourth holing, how hard was it to continue on and how satisfying was it to putt to get a halve at the last?
 RICKIE FOWLER: It was awesome to get a look at a putt to halve the match on the last hole. On hole 4, I mean, basically dropped the wrong ball. It was the same of ball that I had in my pocket and was laying in the mud. It was nice to have that putt for a halve.

 Q. You did not hit a golf shot yesterday. How hard was it to have that happen and then be thrown right in the middle of all of this today in what could be a crucial match for the Americans in this session?
 JIM FURYK: Well, it was tough, but four guys on each side had to do it, both Rickie and I did it, but I was a little anxious early on. Got settled in with the format, and the way these holes worked, I didn't have to hit a lot of iron shots today I think 18 -- he hit it seems like an iron on every hole. It's sometimes hard to get in your rhythm but I think we settled down and did quite well.

 Q. How satisfying was that half point? 
 JIM FURYK: It was good. We were down the entire match. The best we ever was was even, maybe after the first hole, so we were down most of the day to come back and get a halve was big for our team. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: It was awesome, being able to play with a guy like Jim, it's pretty cool. Obviously we were down all day like you said and to have a chance at halving the match at the end was pretty awesome.
