 Q.  Phil, you talked about it, how much heart did this team show on this golf course this morning?  
PHIL MICKELSON: It was a lot of heart, a heart that went out with 2-down and four to go -- it was a match where I didn't drive the ball well.  It was a match where I felt more pressure in any Ryder Cup than I felt heading into this one because of the last two years and the build up.   
I played a little bit tight and my man here got me to hit some shots in the end and hit some iron shots and got me to, he got the best out of me.  I really cherish the opportunity to play with him.  I knew when I first met him many years ago, he was something special.  I never knew that we would play together in The Ryder Cup.  But this is really a special moment.   
 Q.  So much was made of the fact that you had not won a full point yet in your Ryder Cup career, here you are getting your first full one with Phil Mickelson.  How would you describe how hard it is to get a victor?  
RICKIE FOWLER: There's no real way to describe it.  But you look two years back and Jimmy Walker and I had some control in some matches down the stretch in the last few holes, and Europe did some pretty crazy stuff on us and ended up halving some.   
To be with someone I've looked up to growing up as a kid and to finally get my first full point with someone like him, pretty special.
