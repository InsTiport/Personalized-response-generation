Q. (On FedExCup Playoff scoring system.)
RICKIE FOWLER: 15 to 30, you have a good week and you have a chance to get into the top 10, if not even further up; whereas in the old system, I think you needed a lot of things to go right, if not just go win, and even then it was -- obviously you weren't guaranteed to win overall. It's a lot more straightforward. It's right there in front of you. You can see what's going on, what you need to do. So I think for the first year, success.
I'm not sure if there will be any tweaks for next year or anything like that, but it's turning out to be an exciting Sunday. I know it's turned out to be kind of a three-man race. J.T. has got an outside chance to make a little run on the boys, but that's what you want. You want it to come down to the final few holes here on Sunday.
Q. How did you like your week here in Atlanta?
RICKIE FOWLER: Definitely enjoyed it. Always enjoy being here. It's nice to finish off the year at the TOUR Championship. It always means that you've done some things right throughout the year to make it here. I wish I could have had a better week. I kind of struggled off the tee, which then made it hard to score from there, but I was happy to at least salvage decent rounds and then started to play and swing it a little bit better today. Finished off my third round nicely, actually hit some fairways, and same thing in the final round, which made it a little bit more stress-free.
But yeah, this golf course is just a good, hard, tough test. Yeah, it would have been nice to start at a lower number to be closer up there to the guys and not trying to claw your way back because this golf course isn't one that is easy to make ground up on.
