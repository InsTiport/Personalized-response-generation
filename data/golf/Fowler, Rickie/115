 Q.  You had a slow start out of the gates.  What happened there?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I finally made a putt for birdie, which was nice, but I felt like I hit some decent shots to get off to the start.  And I had a couple bad breaks on the greens, a couple missed putts, a couple short ones.  I just kind of settled in finally and really not a whole lot different from the front to the back, just a couple more looks and I had a couple putts that went in.   
 Q.  Is it tough when you get off to a slow start saying, if you're feeling good it's coming, it's coming, even though maybe you're not making those putts?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it's tough, with the wind and with some of the greens the way they are, you can hit a good shot in there and you can still hit a good putt and it may not go in.  So, yeah, it's tough.  You got to kind of keep pushing yourself forward and wait for something good to happen.  I've been swinging well all fall and winter, so just got to stay patient.  So sometimes it is tough, but especially when you see guys go out and get off to a good start where they're 2-under, 3-under on the first few and you feel like you've fallen back.  So it was nice to get a couple on the back nine to at least keep ourselves in a good spot for the weekend.   
 Q.  What is your mentality heading into the weekend?  
RICKIE FOWLER: Get off to a better start than today.  I'll definitely play better this weekend.  The greens seem to be getting a little bit better as each day goes on, they're just getting kind of spiked up.  I feel like there's a kind of a thick layer of grass on top and you can end up in a bad spot where you get some bumps in your way.  But they have been getting better every day and I'll keep the putter going and just keep giving ourself some looks and we'll see if we can chase the boys down.
