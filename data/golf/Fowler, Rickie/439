   RICKIE FOWLER: There's some places there that it doesn't really come into play too much. But there's some -- I think it's very difficult, a lot of places where it definitely comes in here.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 RICKIE FOWLER: 15 from the back tee, the par 3, it's a tough shot. The tee shot on 8 is pretty good.   
 18 is probably one of the tougher shots -- I hit hybrid on Tuesday right to the middle of the green and today, hung it out right a little bit but made a good up-and-down.  
  
  Q. Is it easier with the wait on the green?  
 RICKIE FOWLER: No, I would rather just keep going. We had to wait a little bit there. But yeah, it's unfortunate when you do have to wait on something like, that especially when it's a tough shot. But that's going to happen and just happened to be water over there.   
 It's not an easy shot, and you know, especially if you're waiting a little bit, or wind becomes involved. The last couple of holes, it was kind of up-and-down. 18 was playing back into the wind.   
 So I think Sergio hit 5-wood and I want to say 4-iron, and I hit driver in the bunker and had to chop out and hit 9-iron in. Not an easy hole.
