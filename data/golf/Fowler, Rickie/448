 Q. 3-under through 36, that's a good score out here at Aronimink. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: It is a tough course. I do have a little bit of room out there where I can improve, so that's good. Playing well, and like you said, 3-under through two rounds, off to a good start and looking forward to the weekend.

 Q. The course kind of jumped up and got you at 13 and 14. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I hit a couple rough tee shots. Hit some good putts for par and just caught the lip. It's not playing easy out there. There's some tough pins. If you don't drive it in the fairway, it can be tough.

 Q. Is that what you'll work on, your driving, now?
 RICKIE FOWLER: Driving has actually been really good with the driver. I think I missed the fairway with 3-wood on 12, I ended up making par, and I missed with a hybrid and made bogey on the par-3 with an iron. Actually driver has been really good these first two days, and that's positive, because it hasn't been my best so far this year.

 Q. We talked briefly during the pro-am on Wednesday. I really think this is a good golf course for you because you hit so many little nibble shots, so many little feel shots, and I think you need that to get the ball close on these greens. 
 RICKIE FOWLER: You do. You're not always going to get a perfect number, and some of these pins are tucked in some corners where they're tough to get at. You've got to shape the ball a little bit and be able to control the spin. First of all, you've got to get it in the fairway, but once you do that, yeah, you have to hit some little shots into these greens to be able to get close and make birdies.
