  RICKIE FOWLER:   I had some time off after Ryder Cup and coming here, kind of I guess just looking forward to getting the season started, seeing where the game is at and obviously still some places to improve on but happy to get off to a nice, solid start and actually be in contention.  
   
 Q.   Did you spend time working with Butch over this time?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   I haven't.   Last time I saw him was at Ryder Cup.  
   
 Q.   And you really didn't work there, did you?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   I mean, not necessarily.   Obviously you're just going and playing.   You're not working on stuff there.   And for the most part from when I got stuff going, I would say May, June, it's really been just repetitive, work on the same stuff, keeping everything in check and really a lot of it is just believing in it, course management and staying away from making mistakes, which a lot of that just comes from mental errors.   
So far, I feel like I've done a good job of that here this week.   I made a pretty bad swing on 9 today where I made double and that was more mental than it was physical.   I know how to swing a golf club.   But it's actually getting up there and doing it.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised about the fallout from The Ryder Cup?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   As far as?   
   
 Q.   Well, I mean, all the things that happened afterwards, all the stuff‑‑  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Hey, I'm part of the task force.   You know, the part that is unfortunate, I feel like, is stuff that I feel like happens in the team room, that's said to the team behind closed doors, should stay there.   
I thought Tom did a great job as far as talking to the guys.   He's been there plenty of times.   I enjoyed the time I got to spend with him.   I respect him.   He's a legend in the game.   And I think some of the stuff may have gotten blown a little bit out of proportion.   But we obviously didn't play as well as we needed to play to win.   
If we can figure some things out moving forward that can help us do that, I'm obviously part of the task force and looking forward to getting together with the guys and everyone that's involved and see what everyone has to say.   Obviously we want to win the Cup.   It has not been that there's been lack of motivation or anything like that.   It sucks losing.   Everyone's aware of that and everyone wants to win.
