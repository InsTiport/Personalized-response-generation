 Q.   It's always satisfying to win a match, but when it's Mr. Match Play from Europe, is that extra special?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I knew it was going to be a stuff match today, no matter if Poulter is not on his game.   He wasn't playing great today, but I knew he was going to find a way to hang around and give me something at the end.   
Obviously feels good to get a win against him, against anyone.   Excited for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   I know that you've been working hard on your game with Butch Harmon.   You've missed three cuts in a row coming in here with this transition between techniques.   Was there a feeling this week would be different?   What was the difference today?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I think there is a little bit less to focus on.   I just focus on beating one guy at a time versus 156.   But I've actually been swinging really well.   I feel comfortable with a lot of the changes in the swing that we're working on right now.   I'm excited about working with Butch.   Just need to make a few more putts to make things a little easier.   
   
 Q.   These matches don't get any easier.   Jimmy Walker tomorrow, the hottest player on the planet right now.   Your thoughts on that one?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   I heard he was a six seed, but he's really a No. 1 seed.   It's like him getting a bad seed in any tournament.   I mean, he's best play in the world right now, coming off three wins.   He's going to be tough to beat.   I'll have to be on top of my game and make some putts.   
   
 Q.   Your first first‑round win here since 2011.   How good does its feel at least to advance today?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Kind of like a mini victory, coming off of three missed cuts.   I've been swinging really well, just not been getting the results.   I'm struggling to make putts, which obviously you need to make putts if you want to make cuts and be in contention.  
I was able to hang around today, rolled a good one in for eagle on 13.   Obviously it's nice to get a win against anyone, but Poulter is probably one of the most well‑known match play players.   It feels good to be able to move on.   
   
 Q.   What does it do for your confidence?   A little bit of a struggle, as you just alluded to, working on some things to be able to take down Poulter, and help build confidence not only for this week but moving for washed?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's big.   Like I said, it's like winning a golf tournament.   You go out there put yourself ‑‑ it's almost like being in the final group.   It's just the two of you.   You've got one guy to beat.   It's a big win today.   
Obviously have a very tough match tomorrow against Jimmy Walker, probably the best player in the world right now, coming off three wins.   It's going to be another tough match.   Go out and have some fun.
