Q.   (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER:   I drove it a lot better today so it made it easier.   But the greens are tough right now.   I had a couple putts, one on 15 where I gave it a little too much credit on how fast it was and came up short. 
But other than a couple little mistakes, played pretty solidly.   It just played tough out there today. 

Q.   Bubba has had a great year, he's putted extremely well.   What other things did you see in him coming into this week?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I haven't played with him a whole lot, other than the first round at Bay Hill.   He always had great control of the golf ball.   That's a big thing around here.   You get the ball in play and have control going into the greens it makes it a lot easier.   So his length can help him around here a little bit at times. 
You're able to use a lot of creativity and imagination around here and he has that. 

Q.   Last year he didn't seem to enjoy the year as much, this year he seems to be enjoying it more.   Obviously he's playing better.   Have you seen any change in him from when he started to carry the burden of that Green Jacket?
RICKIE FOWLER:   He's definitely more relaxed.   He's enjoying life a little bit more.   Having Caleb around and having a family, golf is not his, obviously, I guess, main priority in a way, it's a bonus.   Being able to go out and play and look at it as a bonus and have fun on the golf course versus putting a lot of stress on himself.

Q.   Was there any time where you saw him starting to change this year?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Not a whole lot this year.   I would say it's progressively.   He was always a little intense on the golf course and he still is, he is hard on himself at times on the course.   He was tough on himself the first round at Bay Hill when he didn't play so well and ended up withdrawing there. 
I think that over the past couple years, with winning here and having Caleb, adopting him, it's definitely kind of been a progression for changing into something good for him.

Q.   Can you talk about what he's like with Caleb, because you've helped babyâ€‘sit with Caleb at times.   How is he around Caleb?
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's awesome.   We'll stay with them during Bay Hill and hang out there.   We usually finish up and go straight back and mess around at the house and play with Caleb.   He's the show for the night. 

Q.   What kinds of things does he do?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I mean, from playing like with the water sprinkler, seeing me jump off the dock, Caleb loved that.   Throwing balls around in the house.   Kind of his show.   He does whatever he wants, to a certain extent.

Q.   When you talk about him, creativity is always mentioned.   Is that just natural, it's something that you have or you don't have?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I think it's something you have or you don't have.   It's not something you can exactly teach.   There's certain shots that I feel like that I can see or see lines on greens and I know Bubba can see similar things, if not more shape, just because he's able to shape it more, like he did on 10 there in the playoff.   So you have to be able to see the shots to hit them.
