Q. (No Microphone.)
RICKIE FOWLER: I would like to have been in a position to win today, but obviously Dustin played great all week and took care of his 54-hole lead.  So I knew he was going to be tough to catch today and just like I said, just need to be in a better position to go out there and have a chance today.  But all in all solid week, but could have been a lot better.  We definitely need to get some iron shots closer to the hole and had a few putts just miss.  A couple go in here and there, and they add up along the way.  But a nice solid week.  Obviously enjoyed being over here, we spent some time over at Makena prior to the week.  So I think we're going to be on the island for a total of two weeks, so not a bad way to start the calendar year.
Q. When Dustin does plays like this, and he has his game on like he did this weekend, especially today, how difficult is he to kind of keep pace with, or do you need like your A game to keep up with him?
RICKIE FOWLER: I wouldn't necessarily say A game.  I know I can go and play with anyone in the world.  You see guys win usually when they're just playing better than other guys.  Obviously Dustin's very talented, he's No. 1 player in the world, but I wouldn't say that I doubt myself against him.  I know we can go play and have a good time.  We play a bit at home, we have some good matches.  But, no, just obviously just didn't play as well as he did this week, and he took care of business being out front.
