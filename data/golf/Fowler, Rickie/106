Q. Thoughts on the day?
RICKIE FOWLER: Obviously I was in a decent position with a few to play and just had a couple -- really didn't make bad swings -- the drive on 15 I caught a little high on the face and it just kind of stayed straight to the left and typically I play a cut there on that hole.  A little heavy on 16.  17 was -- just got moving a little bit left and once the wind kind of, I mean there was a light breeze, once it got riding left it kind of just kept turning.  Other than that, just couldn't buy a putt.  That's one of the best clubs in my bag.  I felt like I hit a lot of good putts, so it was a little disappointing to not see really anything go in on the back nine.  I think that was kind of the biggest letdown.  That's typically a club I can lean on.  I know I'm a good putter, I putted well all week.  And, yeah, we just -- kept hitting good putts and either they were misreads or they were doing something funky, but maybe the hole was moving, they just didn't want to go in.
Q. Still feel like it's a matter of time before your name is on this trophy?
RICKIE FOWLER: For sure.  I love this place.  The course and I most of the time we get along well.  Yesterday I stepped up and played well coming in.  And today it wasn't really anything much different, just didn't make anything, had a couple bad breaks in a way.  I don't feel like I made necessarily bad swings, more like bad contact on the face that caused the ball to kind of do what it did.  So, no, keep pushing.  But, yeah a little bummed that I didn't really make anything on the back nine to at least move up and have a chance.
Q. Thoughts on the way Chez was able to claw back there at the end.
RICKIE FOWLER: It was cool to see.  Not birdieing 15 and making bogey on 16, kind of putting himself in a hole there with two to play.  17's a very birdie-able hole, 18's a great birdie whenever you can do it.  So he stepped up big time, hit a great putt on the last.  I was just hoping it was going to get there for him, but he obviously had it perfectly read and it was on line.
