RICKIE FOWLER: A little bit of confidence on the shot and the two of us working together, feeling good about going in the back nine.  That was huge.
Phil mentioned the shot on 17.  We knew if I hit a good one in there, it would give us the upperhand coming into 18, regardless of what they did there.
For me, stepping up and hitting the shot on 17 was big.  I think that middle of the match where we worked together and were able to claw back and get ourselves back was big.
Q. Is there any measure of relief for the two of you that this is done and out of the way?
RICKIE FOWLER: A big relief.  Obviously we couldn't ask for a better morning for our team.  For the both of us, obviously with me not having a full point yet and him having a big influence on what we've been doing the last couple of years.  And how this week has shaped up.
So, yeah, it wasn't easy.  I know Phil mentioned that he was a bit tight out there.  It was fun to help him along.  He had asked for me to keep pumping him up as we went.  That was big when we got 7, 8 and 9.  It was fun.  That was a big match for us.
Q. What is the key to winning the foursomes?
RICKIE FOWLER: Well, there's no real key.  I mean, if you hit every fairway and green, you are going to have a good chance.  Obviously working together well as a team, understanding that the both of us aren't going to play perfect golf.  I'm not going to be upset if he hits a bad shot and I know he's not going to be upset with me if I hit a bad shot.
Like I said, if you hit every fairway and green, you will have a pretty good chance.  Maybe we'll have the opportunity to try that tomorrow.
Q. Given the history of the Ryder Cup, what did this morning mean?
RICKIE FOWLER: With everything going on, me not having a point and Phil being a big part of getting this task force and getting the players a lot more involved and getting everyone on the same page, to Arnie passing and him being a huge part of this week, this is big for us this morning.  Obviously to get off to a great start, there's a lot of golf left.
It's not going to be easy this afternoon.  They are going to come back and we're going to have to keep fighting.
