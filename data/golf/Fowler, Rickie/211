Q. I know it was a long day, but you still pulled a 4-under 68 out of it.  Just a few comments on the starting and stopping and finishing up with 4-under.
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, it was nice to get out there, got off to a nice solid start.  We had a little short delay, quite a few hours in there, so it was kind of -- it was fun to kind of hang out, relax.  Came out, made some good swings, got a birdie out of it, and like I said, finished up -- I made a really good swing on 9, so nice to finish that way, no bogeys today.  But definitely a long day of golf.
Q. How did you kill the five hours?
RICKIE FOWLER: A lot of just sitting around, hanging out.  Boo was in there sleeping at one point.  There was people spread out all over, from player family dining to the locker room.  There might have been some pictures posted on Snapchat.  But no, it's always fun to hang with the fellow players and families and just kind of relax.
Q. Course not too bad when you came back out?
RICKIE FOWLER: It was pretty wet.  It's a little dicey hitting wet shots off of wet lies.  I was fortunate, I hit a really good one on 7, ended up making birdie, but you look down at it, and it's a little scary thinking that you're trying to hit a clean wedge off of a wet lie.
