  Q. Thoughts going in?   
 RICKIE FOWLER: If we are down in all of the matches now, getting a little break, cutting it off, stops them from running with the momentum they have. So come back in the morning.   
  
  Q. Not like you haven't done it before.   
 RICKIE FOWLER: No. We've come back, you saw from this morning, or I guess earlier this afternoon, we came back on a few matches, turned them around and halved it.   
  
  Q. Any thoughts about what was going on out there with you and your partner in this late night?   
 RICKIE FOWLER: Phil and I got off to a slow start, best-ball, you need to go make birdies and we just didn't do that. Bogeyed the first hole and I think we made some pars.   
 Just it was tough to get -- we just had a tough time getting things going. We've got a lot of holes to go.   
  
  Q. Just the way that momentum in this crazy game goes?   
 BUBBA WATSON: Oh, man, it's funny, we have been down I think in both matches, or both sessions. The first session the other day, we got rained out for a little bit. But we come back and win, we're one point up on each session. So we are obviously not where we want to be but we still have a long way to go in this session and we can always come back and dominate this session. Right now, we are just -- nobody is really doing much.   
 Me and Overton are 2-under and the other team is 4-under, so we made some birdies. We played well, but made not enough birdies.   
  
  Q. Maybe the break will help everybody, do you think?   
 BUBBA WATSON: I hope so. Seems like we always come out strong in the mornings.
