  RICKIE FOWLER:   Felt nice coming in.   Nice to get a few birdies coming in.

Q.   Talk about the shot on 18 there.   That's a delicate one, obviously. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, 18 is kind of a delicate hole.   I only hit hybrid off the tee, so not exactly the hardest tee shot, but the way you play in from there gets tougher around the green.   You don't want to miss anywhere around the green.   I ended up being in one of the best spots you could be, so got a little lucky, snuck into the first cut there, hit a good pitch, I thought it might have a chance to sneak in, but I'll take 4.

Q.   What's your comfort level around here?   I'm assuming it must be pretty good. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I've hit a lot of good shots around here, so I've probably at least birdied every hole or had good shots on all holes out here.   So definitely able to go into every hole out here comfortable and knowing that we've played it well and hit some good shots there.   Looking forward to tomorrow, and we'll see where the guys end up today coming in.   Anywhere being around the lead on Sunday is good around here. 

Q.   What do you think is a reasonable deficit to still have a shot at coming back? 
RICKIE FOWLER:   I mean, there's definitely‑‑ if you went out and played really well, there's still a low number out there.   Like you said, it's not easy to go low.   Someone that's in the lead is going to have a tough time pulling away.   I wouldn't say five or six is too far back, but obviously three or four is kind of a good place to be. 

Q.   Certain players have reputations, and with you being from California, do you like wind?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, I love playing in the wind.   I wouldn't mind it being like this tomorrow.   No, I enjoy it.   You've got to hit good golf shots and got to hit the ball solidly.   I played well today, hit a few squirrelly shots, but other than that we kept it in play and made a few good swings coming in, made a couple birdies, so put ourselves in a good spot for tomorrow.

Q.   In the last two months I don't think you've been out of the top 10.   What's that about?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Just being patient and kind of staying in the moment and not getting ahead of ourselves and just kind of focusing on each swing and staying really calm and patient out there.   I've been swinging really well, so that's obviously helped me stay very calm and collected out there.   Very confident with my game and where I'm at mentally, so get ourselves in a good position for tomorrow being a few back, go out and have some fun and see what we can do.

Q.   Talk about Spencer Levine's game.   I imagine you must have played with him somewhere along the line. 
RICKIE FOWLER:   It's very simple.   He makes it about as simple as possible.   He drives it well, which around here you've got to play from the fairway, especially when it's windy.   And he's fiery.   I like it.   He's a lot of fun to be around, a lot of fun to play with.   He gets himself in a position tomorrow that if he goes out and plays his game, he's going to be tough to catch.   We're going to have to post a number.   Like I said, he has a very simple game. 

Q.   He had a lead in Phoenix and didn't hold onto it.   You've been in that position before.   What's the X factor to get in that winner's circle?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Well, definitely being there helps, and I definitely believe that he'll be pulling off of Phoenix and the emotions he had there.   What I talked about a little bit with the patience and feeling comfortable out there, that kind of comes from times being in contention and being patient, not thinking too far ahead, and for him staying focused and staying in the moment and focusing on his game plan, because there's going to be times where he's going to hit squirrelly shots.   We're all going to do that, and you kind of stay within yourself, keep moving forward.

Q.   First time you were in this town obviously you got into a playoff in the Nationwide Series down at Scarlet.   What do you like something about courses up in this area?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I've just played well in Columbus.   I'm not sure what it is, but I've got through into the U.S. Open through here.   I lost in a playoff in the Nationwide event in Scarlet, and I've had some good finishes here.

Q.   Seems like guys playing later today have had lower scores.   Did you notice a drastic change in the course conditions from the start of the round until later in the round?
RICKIE FOWLER:   It dried out a little bit later in the day from the amount of wind.   Obviously we got quite a bit of rain yesterday and the course got pretty soft.   But it firmed up a little bit as the day went on, so I'm getting the sense that tomorrow is going to be closer to where‑‑ the conditions we had the first day, which I wouldn't mind. 
Definitely, like I said, it kind of firmed up a little bit as the day went on, but the wind was still there, so not much changed.
