RICKIE FOWLER: Working on the swing to get it back to where we were through the first part of the year.  A little off the last couple of weeks, but heading the right direction.  Just more of a trust issue trying to -- when you're working on some stuff and it feels a little awkward, just because little changes, whether it's grip or setup, can feel astronomical.   
So I thought I did a good job with it today of just committing and trusting the swing and going forward with it, and I think you could see, like I played well on the back nine.  Once I settled in and got some things going, I did a good job.  It was nice to have a little bit of everything click.  Some good up-and-downs.  Made some good putts and drove the ball well in certain areas.  So happy with it and looking forward to tomorrow morning.   
 Q.  You mentioned up-and-down, including 14, I thought that ball looked like it was deep down it that rough behind the green.  How good a save was that?  
RICKIE FOWLER: That's some of the deepest rough there is.  But the lie actually wasn't too bad, and we had enough green there.  I think one of the better ones earlier in the round that I was most pleased with was on 6.  I had a bad lie off the tee in the left rough and took a chance with getting it over and dry and in play over the water.  And had a great shot there to three or four feet.   
It's definitely some thick rough out here, from tee to green.  There's definitely some areas around the greens where you're kind of just hacking it.  Another good one I guess I took a little bit of a hack at was on 15, as well.  It's always nice when you can trust that if you miss a green, you're going to have a chance to get the ball up and down.
