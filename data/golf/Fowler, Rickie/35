CLARE BODEL: Thank you for joining us here at the Renaissance Club.  You know this part of the world quite well.  You won in Gullane a few years ago, but probably first time playing here at the Renaissance Club.  How is it looking for you here.   
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, my first time at the Renaissance Club.  Everything's been great.  We're staying on sight just toward back of the golf course in one of the villas, so we've enjoyed the stay.  Played the front nine on Monday afternoon and I went over and played North Berwick yesterday and had some fun in the rest and we'll get to the rest of the golf course today.   
I always enjoying being over here.  I love playing links golf, and especially on days like yesterday when it's a little bit of weather and you can just go out and push the bag around, have a little fun.   
CLARE BODEL: Justin Thomas told us yesterday that you had recommended North Berwick to him.  Is that someplace that you like to play when you come over here.   
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, second time I've played.  It's a place around this area that we love to go and try and play when there's time.  I told him, you know, originally I was going to try to play Monday afternoon, but I had some stuff I needed to take care of here at the golf course.   
Thought the weather was going to be better, so I thought it would be more beneficial to say the golf course we're going to be playing this week on Monday and went for a fun hit in the rain yesterday.   
CLARE BODEL: You're obviously pretty popular in these parts after your win in Gullane.  Tomorrow you're going to be paired with a bit of a local hero, Robert McIntyre, I think you met on Monday.  Does that give a different vibe when you have the local fans cheering on the local player?   
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, looking forward to it.  I got to see Bob on Monday and we had a little challenge together, 14-club challenge.  We had some fun doing that together.  Obviously a great player and looking forward to playing alongside him.  I'm sure we're going to have some good crowds.   
Like you said, I get a lot of local support, which I definitely appreciate.  I think they can see how much I love not just the game of golf, but links golf and being over here, choosing to play here the week before The Open.  This is always a fun week for us.   
 Q.  Who won the 14-club challenge?  
RICKIE FOWLER: We had a draw and then we had a bunch of different playoff options.  Bob ended up winning.  It was a pretty, you know -- came down, it was 1-1, a heated battle.  It was not playing easy.  We both hit shots we thought would be playing to the front of the green.  It's a false front and a bunch of balls were rolling off the back, as well.  I think we both did a lot better than just hitting one on the green.   
 Q.  Did he tell you about shinty?  
RICKIE FOWLER: I hit a couple with it.  There's a little bit more drag compared to a golf club, but felt like I put a decent strike on it.  It was fun to just go out there and have a hit and mess around, and we had a good time with it.
