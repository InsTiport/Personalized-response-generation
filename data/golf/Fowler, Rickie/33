RICKIE FOWLER: Didn't take advantage of some opportunities that I had.  Didn't make any putts, didn't play the par 5s well.  Had a couple unforced errors and got out of position.  So really wasn't hitting it all that bad.  You know, with being out of position on 14 with the layup there and then 18, kind of unforced error, missing the green left going for it in 2.
So two bogeys on par 5s definitely don't help out here when those are holes that you need to score on.  And then just kind of got a little sloppy on some missed greens coming in, 7, 8.
So I have a tee time tomorrow, so things could be worse.  I know I like where the game is.  I know what I'm capable of, and I think we can go get ourselves a good one tomorrow and get right back in this thing.
Q. Is this the kind of golf, you know, one day good, one day -- it's just that fine line?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, I think it -- I mean, it shows you how fine of a line it is between scoring well out here.  It's there.  I think they've done a good job.  The USGA has done a good job with the setup.  It's scorable.  But you've got to be on and you've got to be playing from the fairway and you've got to be controlling your ball and hitting your numbers.
And in certain situations, I was just a little off.  And those typically turn into bogey unless you hit -- make a really good kind of rescue shot or others if you're not careful.
Q. What mentality will you bring to the course tomorrow?  What are you going to focus on?
RICKIE FOWLER: Fairways and greens.  I mean, first and foremost, get the ball on the short grass, and then from there, these greens are so small that most of the time, if you're in the middle of the green, you're not too far from where that hole location is.
But that's the big thing, just go back and get back to where we were yesterday and make it as stress free as possible.  But like I mentioned earlier, that's the fine line between it being stress free and going out and shooting a smooth 77.
