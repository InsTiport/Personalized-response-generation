Q.   It was forecast to blow a little bit more in the afternoon?
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, you never know what you're going to get.   Definitely the course is still a little soft out there from what we're used to seeing for The Open Championship.   But you play with what you get.   The course is still really tough.   A lot of rough and the bunkers are still‑‑ you don't want to go in them.

Q.   How were the bunkers?
RICKIE FOWLER:   You'd better not find out.   They're very tough.   Around the greens you're able to get some decent lies and possibly get it up and down.   But you hit it in the fairway bunker you're rarely going to advance if more than 20, 30 yards.

Q.   It seems packed in all the stands, how is the crowd?
RICKIE FOWLER:   The crowd's been great.   The last two days the weather has been great.   Obviously the weather is really good right now.   A lot of fans out.   I've had supporters out in orange today, quite a few, actually.   No, coming in all the stands around the greens were pretty much full.   18 was almost full and we're only a few groups into the morning tee times.
So with the weather being as good as it is I think you're going to see a pretty packed group of fans out there.   Seeing some of the coverage with certain groups it's already five, six deep and probably more people piling in.

Q.   What about the scores today?   There's going to be low scoring later on you think?
RICKIE FOWLER:   There's definitely low scores out there.   There are some pins accessible.   A few tough pins.   But with the weather the way it is, the course is still soft.   If you go out there and drive it well and put yourself in the fairway you'll be able to attack the course a bit.
I was 3‑under early but had a few struggles.   Shooting anything under par today is good.
