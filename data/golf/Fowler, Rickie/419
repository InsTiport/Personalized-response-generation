 Q.   What do you attribute the play today to?   How did you get around so well?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   Drove it well.   Put myself in position off the tee, which is key here, no matter what, especially with the wind blowing today, I was able to play out of the short grass as much as possible.   
I had very good speed with my putter today, so I was able to‑‑ if not roll in a couple long putts, I had very easy 2‑putts, and I think between the driving and the putting, that was key today.   
   
 Q.   You get your first win Sunday and here you are right back on Saturday in contention again?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, it's trying to make the most of playing well.   Played well the last two weeks and last week got the win.   Coming into this week, kind of the goal was to get into the weekend since I had not been here before.   Nice to finally get to play on the weekend and making the most of it today, even more fun, and nice to be in the mix for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You got to the weekend by playing so well yesterday on the back.   Did you feel that same feeling when you walked to the practice tee this morning, when you're walking to the first tee?  
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, well, yesterday I tried to get the most out of the round that I could.   It was nice to get things going from 9 on, and finally made some birdies.   In a way, similar to last week, Quail Hollow, where I wasn't playing so well, and made a few birdies coming in to salvage a good round versus shooting 76 to 78.   
Yesterday I was able to get a few under par, instead of shooting around even and kind of gives me the momentum going into today and to be able to go out and shoot 66 and put myself right back into the mix is right where we want to be.   
   
 Q.   When you hit your first drive, did you say, oh, I got it again today?   
RICKIE FOWLER:   I mean, I did hit a very good drive off the first tee, but it was‑‑ you never know what you're going to get.   The wind was blowing pretty good early.   Still blowing a little bit right now.   
My main focus was to drive the ball well today, and I did that.   I didn't miss a whole lot of fairways.   That gave me the opportunity to play out of the short grass and have control of my golf ball.
