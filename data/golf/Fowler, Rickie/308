Q.   Rickie, just comment on another 3-under par 69 today.   Just get some comments on your rounds.
RICKIE FOWLER:   Yeah, the game feels pretty good right now.   Starting to putt better and tee to green doing all right.   Still can clean up a few things.   Played fairly solid the last two days.   Nice to kind continue to move forward.   Excited for the weekend.   I feel like I can get some good rounds and see if we can get ourselves into contention, see what some of the guys that got off the a good start yesterday, what they do, and kind of dictates what we're going to have to do over the weekend.
Like I said, see if we get ourself in contention to get the feelings back and ultimately be ready for the same feeling next week.

Q.   Any birdies stand out this morning?
RICKIE FOWLER:   I'm trying to think of the birdies.   I made a nice putt on 13, par 5 kind of got my round going.   Started the round with 3 pars and then made a good birdie there and kind of just cruised on.   I made probably my best birdie of the day, I would say, was 16.   Hit a -- hit the perfect shot that I wanted to in there and made a good putt.
