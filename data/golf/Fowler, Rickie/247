Q. Different conditions you found when you got out there today.  Talk about the round a little bit.
RICKIE FOWLER: It was definitely still scorable.  The wind was up from a different direction, but as you can see from some of the scores, the guys were still making birdies.  Some of the holes played a little tougher and then we got some downwind that you could take advantage of.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to.
Q. Knowing you'll be about maybe 8 or so behind going into tomorrow, what's your focus?  Your mentality heading in, knowing you're going to need a low one?
RICKIE FOWLER: I've been swinging well all week.  I haven't putted quite as well as I wanted to, so just need to get some putts to go in.  That's been kind of the biggest thing of the I made a lot of really good swings, really enjoy playing with Danny Lee today, we had a good time.  No, getting the ball to go in the hole.  If I can make some putts tomorrow, get some stuff going early it will be nice.
