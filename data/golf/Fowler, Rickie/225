Q. Tough day out there.  Just talk about your round a little bit?
RICKIE FOWLER: Yeah, unfortunate the last two days.  Didn't swing as well as I did the first two days.  Couple tough breaks, and it wasn't playing easy out there for sure.  It's a fine line between playing well on this golf course and it eating you alive.
I feel like we did a good job kind of hanging in there.  Made some good up-and-downs to kind of keep the round alive.  Yeah, not a terrible tournament.  Still a decent finish.  But yeah, not bad to not play well two of the four days and still get a good finish.
Q. Is there anything with your swing that you're worried about after the last two days or is it just golf?
RICKIE FOWLER: No, just golf.  Swing still feels really good.  Made a great swing on the 18th there.  I made some good swings coming in, a couple poor ones, but more of it's just kind of commitment and feeling comfortable over the shot.
I've been swinging really well.  Obviously did the first two days.  Not far off when I have missed them.
Q. You expressed so much confidence yesterday that you could get back in this.  Was there a point early on where you just said, it's not going to work out?
RICKIE FOWLER: I got off to a great start.  Made a bad swing on 8 that put me back.  I was trying to get to where I could possibly turn at three, which would have put me at 7 and obviously in a great position with where things are turning out now.
After I hit it in the water on 11, that was probably when I knew that it was going to be tough to get back up there.  Like I said, I did a good job of hanging in there.  Made a really good bogey there.  Made a good up-and-down on the hole after that and the hole after that and the hole after that, and made a good putt for birdie on the hole after that.
Like I said, scrambled well.  Kind of kept moving forward and happy about that.
