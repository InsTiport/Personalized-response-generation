 Q.  This is the 19th time played your national championship and this is the lowest round you've shot on this golf course.  You must be very pleased.  
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, I'm very pleased.  Obviously tough this morning, breezy, and the rain was there, too.  It was cold.  Finishing 67, I would have dreamed about a clean card, five birdies and 13 pars.  It was a very good day at the office and I'm happy here.   
 Q.  Is there a feeling this may be a turning point in the season for you?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET: I hope so.  It's a big period for us, last week, this week, the next two and The Open hopefully, and then you have the US PGA if you play well.  This stretch is quite important for us obviously and you need to play well in those weeks for sure.  You could play well before or after, but you will never go as quick as if you play well now.   
So hopefully yeah, those four cuts will be behind me.  It's just a good day.  Yesterday was not as good and a good cut last week, so hopefully, yeah, it will keep going this way.   
 Q.  Obviously you've played this golf course a lot of times, seen a lot of changes.  You must be very pleased to see it in the condition it's in this week?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, it's a great course.  Everybody agrees on that.  If you ask 95 per cent of the players, will say this is a top three, if not the No. 1.   
It's a great course.  It's hard, but it's fair.  You could be, I mean, really badly punished, but if you play well, you could shoot some low scores like I did today, like Graeme Storm, and Ryan Fox, played with him, played 4-under.  So there's room for a good score.  But that's the beauty of it.  It's hard but it's fair.
