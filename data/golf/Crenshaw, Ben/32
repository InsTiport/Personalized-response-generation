 Q.  Regarding the conditions. 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  Hard to find your feel today all the way around.  It is just hard work, really hard work. 

 You're in trouble when you start guessing at it.  And then you try something different. 

 It is glassy, it's fast, there's a lot of breeze and it's cool.  And then you add the length and breadth of the course it's really difficult.... 

 There are tough conditions when it's stingy and fast, it's really difficult.  You just react to the conditions.  Players have to change their target score a bit.  You have to take what you get.  Even par is a superb round of golf.  Retief's round had to be real solid. 

 Q.  Regarding Appleby's early strong play. 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  Aussies know how to play in the breeze.
