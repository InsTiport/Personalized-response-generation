 Q.  Ben Crenshaw you are the leader in the clubhouse, a round of 70, 2-under; 3-under for the Championship.  Are you thinking there is a chance? 
 BEN CRENSHAW:  No.  I think if Brad hits -- he's hit a good shot at 17, but 18 -- if he gets two good shots there, he's looking very good; but it's a tough finish. 
 17 is a hole that if you just hit it on the green, it will feed right down to that hole, and I was not proud of that shot, but this was a fabulous course to play this week. 
 You had to have your thinking cap on every second.  I think it's a fabulous creation, and it sure has shown some people excitement this week.  It's very elusive. 

 Q.  26 putts in the round and your best finish.  Congratulations. 
 BEN CRENSHAW:  Thank you.
