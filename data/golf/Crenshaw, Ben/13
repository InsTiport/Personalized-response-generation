Q.   What did you hit?
BEN CRENSHAW:   I hit a pitching wedge.   It was the second one I've made on that hole.

Q.   Oh, okay. 
BEN CRENSHAW:   You try to throw it up on the right‑‑ to the right of the hole and it just came down in.

Q.   How many is that in your career?
BEN CRENSHAW:   That's 21.

Q.   21?
BEN CRENSHAW:   Yeah.

Q.   Wow.   Do you remember when the last one was on that hole? 
BEN CRENSHAW:   Yeah, it was a pitching wedge.

Q.   Do you remember what year that was, though? 
BEN CRENSHAW:   It was eightyears ago or so, something like that.   This Club has it.   I'm losing years.

Q.   Was it a thrill over there? 
BEN CRENSHAW:   It's fun, it's fun.   We had a good day, beautiful day.

Q.   Do you remember your first Masters shot at your first Masters? 
BEN CRENSHAW:   Oh, yeah.   We were speaking about‑‑ we did a club interview yesterday with Raymond Floyd and Tom Watson, and we all recounted what we did.   We were all extremely nervous on the first hole. 
You get so juiced up and you can't wait to hit it and then you‑‑ if you catch it right, you hit the longest shot you've ever hit because you are just so keyed up.

Q.   What happened on yours?
BEN CRENSHAW:   It a good one.

Q.   Okay. 
BEN CRENSHAW:   I was happy to do it.

Q.   Who was caddying for you today? 
BEN CRENSHAW:   Well, my friend from Austin.   I gave Carl Jackson a rest.
