 Q.   I know that this is the second to last round and you had to do it without Carl on the bag today.   Could you talk about that?  
BEN CRENSHAW:   Yeah, he was tender coming in and I knew it.   I wanted him to just feel comfortable.   He's had some health issues.   I'm sorry, but the last thing we're going to do is push anything.   So, no, he was there.   I saw him this morning.   He looked pretty good.   So his brother's taking good care of me.   
   
 Q.   Now that there's probably one last day for you going around, will he be able to go tomorrow and just your thoughts going into it?   This is now the end.   
BEN CRENSHAW:   Yeah, I don't know.   I'll talk to him again tomorrow.   But I'm ready to close it out.   I'm tuckered out.   I didn't have much energy today.   I just played awful.   
The people were so nice today.   I couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to, I played so poorly.   But they were great, the people were great.   I'm ready to get it over with tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Having said that, how important to you, how much does it mean to you to have Carl with you tomorrow just for that one last goâ€‘round?  
BEN CRENSHAW:   He'll be with me.   I don't know if he's going to caddie, but we'll see.   But he'll close it out with me on number 18.   He may come out on the green or something like that.   We don't know just yet, but he'll be with me.   I'll see him tomorrow.
