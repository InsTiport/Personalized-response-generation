 Q.  On his round today. 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  I'm sick to my stomach.  I hate finishing with three bogeys.  If you're a little off it's really difficult. 

 Q.  Talking about the atmosphere. 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  The course is really difficult.  A day like today, it got glassy.  You can't take liberties.  Holes with short irons in, you must execute. 

 Q.  In reference to the second year making the cut. 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  I have fun playing.  It's a very imaginative place.  You have to play with instinct.  There weren't many club selections I suffered with.  I enjoy it. 

 I've had so many nice things here.  I enjoy the way it's portrayed here.  You have to rely on touch and imagination.  Short irons for me?  Par-5 holes, number 3. 

 I can't envision teeing it up here 50 times (referring to Gary Player's 50th time).  It's remarkable.  Fans are so kind.  I've had had some very nice times here. 

 Player/Nicklaus/Palmer, they were good for each other.  They were remarkable. 

 Q.  In reference to the nature of the course now. 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  You try not to get hurt. 

 Q.  In reference to the leader board. 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  One's that are up there, there's not a lot of up-and-downs. 

 Tim Clark is a very solid, solid player.  He's adequate. 

 Number 15, that was nice.  I wanted to hold steady.
