  Q. How did it go out there?  
 BEN CRENSHAW: I played okay. I made one birdie. 16. And I hit a couple of good putts, but just didn't quite drive it well. But I played all right for the most part.   
  
  Q. How were the greens today?  
 BEN CRENSHAW: They were quick. The pins -- I thought the course was set up today very tough. Flag sticks were tough, I thought.   
 I thought the first two days it was going to be set up a little easier. But it seems to be the pattern that they set it up tough.   
  
  Q. Today Gary broke Arnie's record, 51 in a row. You've got 37 now. Tell me your thoughts about him doing 51?  
 BEN CRENSHAW: I'm so happy for those two. God, to have them here this long, they're so much a part of this place. They made it what it is.   
 You can't mention one without the other two, really, they have meant so much to this place.   
  
  Q. But to have played 51, you played 37. Do you got another 14 in you somewhere?  
 BEN CRENSHAW: I don't know. I don't know. I hope so.
