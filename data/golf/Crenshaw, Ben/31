 Q.  Regarding the conditions. 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  You will see some good scores today.  Greens are receptive.  You may see some fireworks today. 

 Q.  Do they need to make some kind of change or are the conditions the factor? 

 BEN CRENSHAW:  Conditions make it so.  When you have this much golf course and it is open and vulnerable in the cool and the breeze, scores are going to go up. 

 You can play a little more aggressively to spots today.  There's not much wind, it's softer and they moved the tees up just slightly.
