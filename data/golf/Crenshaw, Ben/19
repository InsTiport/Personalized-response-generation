 Q. How do you feel the course played today?
 BEN CRENSHAW: It played pretty tough today, I thought, in the afternoon. The wind didn't let up much. It was a good hard test this afternoon, I thought. 

 Q. What adjustments are you going to make going into the weekend?
 BEN CRENSHAW: I just got to play better. I got to hit my irons a little bit better. I messed up the par-5, number 15. I made a 6 there. 
 But I only made one birdie. You can't do much, you got to make some birdies.

 Q. Did you hit every fairway today?
 BEN CRENSHAW: I probably did. But my greens in regulation are not too great. I'm missing a few too many greens.

 Q. Do you feel bad, though, just your knowledge of the course, as far as knowing where to put the ball?
 BEN CRENSHAW: It should help. But the rhythm was not quite as good as I would like today and my putter was not quite as good. I left a lot of them short. So I don't know, it's just adjustments and try to get a couple good rounds in for the weekend.
