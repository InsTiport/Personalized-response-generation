 Q. Do you feel that it's easier to play on your course after you played it a couple times?
 BEN CRENSHAW: Sure, any time you play a golf course, no matter whose it is, you learn some more about it. I think it's a fair test in the wind too, but the guys are starting to know it, and they've played golf for a living for their whole lives and they break a course down as to how they think they can play it. And they're getting a feel for it, which is nice. 

 Q. What are you going to try to do to step it up tomorrow?
 BEN CRENSHAW: I just got to do everything better. I am driving it okay, but I'm not hitting the ball close to the hole. And I haven't putted well. Last two -- I putted okay the first day, but I haven't put together line or speed the last couple days. A little balky, a little tentative with it.
