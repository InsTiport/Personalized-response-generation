  Q.  How was the course playing?   
 BEN CRENSHAW:  I think the conditions were nice.  It was cool starting out.  The wind didn't come up real hard, yet still it was a very tough test of golf.   
  
  Q.  Condition of the greens.   
 BEN CRENSHAW:  The firmness is what we look for.  There are some spots you can stop it with a lofted club, but I don't hit any lofted clubs.  So I don't know about that.   
 Some of the tees weren't all the way back, but some were.   
 You feel like the course is going to get you somewhere.  It doesn't matter who you are.   
 With the greens being firm, that is what starts spreading people out.  We had rounds as difficult last year.  It's a beautiful day, not quite as difficult.  But the wind starts blowing, it will be different.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the the strong European players.   
 BEN CRENSHAW:  They are wonderful players.  The breadth of them are very capable.  They like these conditions and have great imagination.  They have done well all over the world.   
  
  Q.  Regarding Amen Corner.   
 BEN CRENSHAW:  Herbert Warren Wind gave the name regarding Amen Corner.  It is one of the greatest names.  It is the corner of the course where anything can happen.  It is an emotional turn for anybody.
