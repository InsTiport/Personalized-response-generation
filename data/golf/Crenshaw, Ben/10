  BEN CRENSHAW:   I think that he's really helping Gary.   Gary is such a talent.   I think Tony knows in situations, it's just his experience, dealing with certain situations.   He won't let you get too far up or too far down and he's seen‑‑ he's been around.   He's seen so many courses and how they play.   
The main thing he knows how‑‑ and what he can do in certain situations, what we needs to work on.   He's an encourager, but ‑‑ he's really helpful.  
   
 Q.   And especially at a place like this where he's been here so many times?  
BEN CRENSHAW:   Oh, man.   They ought to do great here.  
   
 Q.   This sort of thing is unique to Majors.   What is the best part of this Par 3 Contest from a player's perspective?  
BEN CRENSHAW:   It's fun.   It's amazing, the conditions, the greens are just almost as fast as they are, maybe just a hair softer.   But it's made for a pleasurable day.   It's just entertainment for people and it's really fun.   
   
 Q.   Do you get as much funout of it?   
BEN CRENSHAW:   I do.   I tell people it's the only greens I can reach in regulations.  
   
 Q.   How did you enjoy the Australian barbecue last night?  
BEN CRENSHAW:   It was good.  
   
 Q.   Moreton bugs?   Did you figure out what is?  
BEN CRENSHAW:   Yeah, they were little lobster claws, very good.   He went to a lot of trouble.   That's a long way to get those in.   But they were very good.   
He is such a gentleman, I tell you what.   He's very polished gentleman, he really is.   Wonderful guy.
