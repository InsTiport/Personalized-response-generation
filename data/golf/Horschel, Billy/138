 Q.   Little bit of everything in your round today.  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah.   It was good.   Very solid day.   I knew I needed to come out.   The goal starting the day was 8-under.   Played really solid.   Obviously made the turn at 4-under.   You know, couple of putts on the backside slipped by just a little bit and then obviously the pins were a little bit tougher.   Hit a couple wayward drives that didn't give me full advantage of taking care of the par 5s on 15.   Was a solid round and I knew I needed to come out and play the best round I possibly could today, and I did about just that.   So, we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Was it nerve-wracking?  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   We dealt with it.   No matter how long you've played golf, you've dealt with rain delays.   Sure, it doesn't help for me.   I'm a guy who just wants to go, and, so, it wasn't -- I mean, it was okay.   It was nice that basketball was on.   It wasn't that my Florida Gators got their butts handed to them today, but nice just to watch basketball and take your mind off the golf, especially the 18th tee shot.   Just deal with it over time.  
   
 Q.   Happy with your putt on 18 to give you a chance?  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I've seen too many guys, you know, in that situation, you need to make a putt and leave it short.   I said, you know what, I need to be aggressive with it.   I hit a good putt.   I don't think I putted it, just break a little bit more than what I thought.   Not sure a little more grain took effect of it.   I hit a good putt.   
More disappointed with the second shot.   Not that I was trying to flag it, I was trying -- I was trying to get it to 15 feet, and we come back out, we have 204 to the flag and we're not sure how far the ball is flying.   I hit a 6-iron, the flight is 190.   I knew I was amped up.   If I hit a good, solid one and turned it over a little bit, it would be pretty good.   I didn't square the face up enough.   All in all, everything was a good day.
