 Q.  Nice birdie on your last.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Yeah, it was a great day today.  5-under, no bogeys.  It doesn't matter -- even though it's on the easier course, the North Course, it's still a good day.  My perfectionist self is going to say it should have been better because I didn't play the par-5s well.  I only put one of my tee shots in the fairway on the par-5s and that's the one I birdied.  So it could have been better.  But all in all it was a great day, happy with how it turned out.   
 Q.  I know you were frustrated with last season.  But in truth, no matter what you did last year was going to be hard to duplicate your FedExCup championship.  Have you put that all in perspective with the attitude you're taking out here this season?  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Last year is last year.  It was a solid year until the last four or five weeks of the year and then I played great.   
You know what?  Maybe it was because I was a little tired.  I didn't do a good job of resting myself right after the FedExCup, and so right after I knew I was going to take a long break after BMW Championship and TOUR Championship.  I did that.  I had 10 weeks off.  I feel fresh.  I've been working hard on the game.   
Obviously, everyone knows I switched equipment to Parsons PXG and these clubs and very excited about it there's some stuff that I'm doing with these clubs that I haven't been able to do in the last few years and it's going to be a great year, I know it is.   
 Q.  How good is it to get off to a great start?  
BILLY HORSCHEL: It's good.  You know you got to make your number at the North Course.  The guys that have always won here have always played well on the North Course.  I didn't go a good job of that last year, so I focused hard on just giving myself as many opportunities for birdies on the North Course.  5-under, no bogeys, clean card, can't complain about that.  Perfectionist side says I probably should have shot a couple better if I would have put some tee balls in the fairway on the par-5s but all in all a great day.   
 Q.  North Course a little tougher this year than it has been in the past?  
BILLY HORSCHEL: You know, I think it is.  I got on number 11 green, my 11th hole and there was a scoreboard there and I saw there wasn't that many low scores.  I think the greens are a little bit quicker, some of the pin locations are a little bit tougher this year, the rough's what it is, but the greens were fast, they got some tough pin locations, so when the wind's blowing a little bit, it makes it a little bit difficult.  So, yeah, I think it's just a little bit tougher than usual.
