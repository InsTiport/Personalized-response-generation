 Q.  Overall week you got to be feeling pretty good.  Trending in the right direction.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Yeah, really solid week.  I only made two bogeys all week, so that's a really good thing to do.   
Played really well all four days.  Last two days actually I just couldn't get a putt to fall really.  In a shootout like this you're going to have to have a little bit of luck, and I just didn't have any.   
Hit a couple shots today that -- you know, I look back at 15 and 17.  The one at 15 sort of just got a little bit of water between the ball and the club face and it just shot a little -- you know, jumped out of that lie or jumped on me.   
And then 17, I just needed to put that ball -- was being aggressive trying to be in the fairway.  And the rough wasn't too bad; I just had a lie that I thought was going to come out a little bit softer but lands two yards shorter; have no more than eight feet for birdie.   
So like I said, really good week.  Just sometimes you need a little bit of luck, and when you have that luck you know it's your day.  I just didn't have it.   
 Q.  Speaking of luck, unlucky on 18.  How does that not go in?  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Yeah, you know, there you go right there.  I hit a good putt; it was an inside right putt.  I wanted to make sure I got it to the hole, and obviously I hit a really good putt.  Didn't hit it too hard.   
Jus wiggled a little bit left on me at the end from going in dead center.  It went in left center.  I still thought I made it and, yeah, it lipped out.   
Like I said, I had a couple of those that could have easily gone in today.   
 Q.  Now it's just a waiting game.  What's this time like for you right now?  Do you have a routine?  Is there something you do?  
BILLY HORSCHEL: You know what?  Troy is only two groups behind me, so I'll know here within the next 10, 15 minutes.   
So literally just sit here and see what happens.  You know, whatever happens, we'll take it.   
 Q.  What about overall here in Lexington, first year for the Barbasol?  General impressions of the tournament, the course?  I know the weather was miserable.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: I think Barbasol did a great job putting on a great event.  I think the course is awesome.  It's unfortunate that we've had so much rain.  I think if this course is playing fast and firm, the greens are firm, scores would be ten shots higher.   
But I think it's a great, great tournament.  I have to tip the hat to the maintenance crew.  I mean, we have had a lot of water here the last seven days.  For them to have this course in somewhat playability is pretty special.   
A lot of hats go off to a lot of people that made this tournament special.  It's a great one.  I think it's going to have a long lasting life here.
