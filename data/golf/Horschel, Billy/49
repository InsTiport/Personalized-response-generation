 Q.  Maybe assess your play over the last couple days, some great improvements and 6-under going to the weekend?  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Yeah, I feel my game's been in a really good spot all year, unfortunately I've been a little mental issue type deal and decided to address it last week and start working with someone, Bhrett McCabe who works with a lot of guys out here, he's been real successful with them and he's given me just what I needed so far and it's been great.  So we're just tweaking the practice a little built, sort of listen a little better to TA and the way I need to do things and so the game's been good.  It hasn't been perfect, no, but I'm out of that trying to play perfect golf, which is what I needed to do.   
 Q.  You're seeing the results in the first two rounds.  Now I know most of your focus is certainly on golf, but I've been watching some college basketball over the last couple days, your Gators are moving on.  Taking on Texas Tech tomorrow.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Yeah, I've been watching a little bit.  I watched about 10 minutes of the game last night and obviously I had to go to bed early, early tee time, but, yeah, I've been watching the Gators and my older brother is director of sports medicine at College of Charleston.  I've been a fan of them for quite a long time, so those are my two teams and they play Auburn today at 7:30 so I'll be pulling for them as well, so I got two teams in this tournament and yeah, go back and watch some basketball now.
