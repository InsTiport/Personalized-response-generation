Q.   Here with Gator grad Billy Horschel and defending FedExCup champ.   Tell me about your round.   A 1‑under, a little bit bumpy in the back nine. 
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, very sloppy today.   I didn't hit it as good as I have the last couple days and the putts were burning some edge, sort of a little disappointed because I birdied 9 and 11 and I'm like 9‑under par, I'm like if I get two or three more coming in or at least just two, 5‑under on this course isn't too bad. 
And then you make three bogeys in a four hole stretch and sort of just derails the round a little bit.   It's a little disappointing.   But still two more days left, I feel good with the way I'm putting it, I know the swing's not that far off and who knows I shoot 10‑under the next two day, on each course, and we'll be right back in it.

Q.   We heard the eruption.   You were playing with Phil.   What was it like playing with him?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   He's always a pleasure to play with.   He's such a great guy.   He makes everyone in the group feel great and feel at ease.   Obviously he does draw a big crowd and he's a big time player. 
So, I've gotten to know Phil the last couple years and it was enjoyable out there today.   We both didn't play great, but I think the next two days we're going to play a little bit better.
