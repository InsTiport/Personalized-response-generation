 Q.  Bogey-free today, good, solid week, and a huge move in the FedExCup points.  Projected all the way to 14th?  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Yeah, it's a week I needed.  Only second time I've made the cut in the Northern Trust in the first event.  I knew if I could play well the first week, I could lock up my spot in THE TOUR Championship.  I've done that.  I've played a great week, and bogey-free for the weekend.  I played really good, really solid, so I'm happy with it.   
 Q.  Can I ask you how the putt doesn't go left on 17?  I'm calling 35 feet up the slope, he's looking for it to move left when it loses speed.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: You know, the ball was sitting in a little hole, so I judged it just right and came out, knew it had great speed.  It was just right of the hole.  Ten feet, I'm thinking, it's going to go in, it's going to go left -- and it didn't move left, and it moved left after the hole, and I said, shocking.
