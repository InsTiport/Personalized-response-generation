Q.   11 consecutive rounds in the 60s.   Talk about that. 
BILLY HORSCHEL:   You know, it was like two different nines.   I played really good on the front side, hit some really good shots, drove it really good actually, and then I went to 10 and made a bad iron swing on that hole and unfortunately made bogey.   Made a good swing on 11, I thought I made that putt and it lipped out.   12 hit a good iron shot in there, it spun, and it's the first ball I've seen spin all week. 
But after that I was holding on to the reins pretty tight.   I wasn't swinging‑‑ the driver was getting a little quick at the top and I wasn't putting the ball in the fairway, and when you can't put the ball in the fairway on the back side, it really challenges you, and unfortunately I made a couple bogeys from it. 
But I was able to keep it together, battle, and turn in a number that I can be somewhat happy with and put me in a great position going into Sunday.

Q.   You have an opportunity to put an exclamation point on your PGA TOUR season.   From a nerves perspective, how do you think you'll feel this evening going into the final round?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   You know what, I wish we'd just go tee it up right now and play tomorrow's round because that's what I really would like to have happen.   But obviously it doesn't happen that way.   I'm going to have to go back to the hotel and hang out.   At least it'll take a couple hours away from the tournament watching the Florida Gators play, but you know what, nerves are what‑‑ we like to feel nerves.   It makes us feel alive, at least it makes me feel alive.   It makes me feel I'm competitive.   I want to compete and I'm in the right position.   I've been in positions this year where I haven't felt that because I haven't had a chance.   I'm loving it, I really am loving it.   Hey, listen, it's going to happen, and you've just going to deal with it.   We've all dealt with it a whole lot.
