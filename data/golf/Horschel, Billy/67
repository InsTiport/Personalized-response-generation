 Q.  How odd of a position is it to be in in this sport where you're not supposed to root against anybody, but you need to win and also have someone else not win to advance.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: I'm used to rooting against the Seminoles, so it's not going to be unfamiliar territory:   
We'll see what.  Brooks was playing really well.  He played the last eight holes yesterday 6-under.  If he plays the way he has been, I think it's going to be tough for me to advance.  But all I can do is go out and try to win.   
 Q.  You always look at leaderboards because you need to know where you stand based on what you have in front of you, whatever hole you're playing.  Tomorrow will you be looking at the scoreboards a little bit at the other matches while you're playing or will you only be concentrating on the task at hand?  
BILLY HORSCHEL: I'll probably look at the leaderboard when I make the turn.  Hopefully I get off to a good, quick start and get up on Jaco a little bit.  I've just got to do what I've got to do and wherever the chips fall at days end.
