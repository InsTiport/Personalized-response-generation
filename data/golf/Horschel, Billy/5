Q. How would you assess your play today?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Another really solid round of golf.  I don't think I got everything out of it that I did yesterday, I think I may have probably played a little better than even yesterday.  But when I look back at it, holes 7 through 13 I had five or six putts inside 15 feet, 10, 15 feet and I didn't make any of those and I've been a really good putter for the last few years and I would expect to at least make two or three of those and my stats would say the same thing.
So I left some out there on the golf course, I don't think I've done anything special and I'm going to have to do something special probably tomorrow to have a chance to win.
Q. You say today might have been better than yesterday what was in your been, what you did better today than you did yesterday?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I think the reason why I was better is I got off to a fairly decent start and I just wasn't making anything until the middle part of the round and in the past I probably would get impatient and start trying to force some shots close to the hole.  I did a really good job of staying patient and trusting that I'm hitting good putts and it was just a matter of time until they started going in.
Q. What's your, what's the mentality you have going out tomorrow knowing you'll probably be a few shots back?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, I expect to be about four back, when I tee it up tomorrow, maybe five depending upon how a couple of guys finish.  You always have to go low here.  Very rarely is par a really good score around here.  So I know I'm going to have to go low and I'm just going to try and do the same thing I've done the last two days, just try and play really solid golf, give myself a lot of opportunities and hopefully have one of those really hot putting days that I'm accustomed to having on somewhat of a regular basis.
Q. Do you feel like the hard work you've been putting in on your swing you've obviously been working a lot, even on the range here, is really paying off now?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, I think it's getting there.  I'm a perfectionist at heart and so I don't think it's exactly where I want it, when I see it on video it doesn't look the same as it did in I would say early December when I was at the Shark Shoot-out and the way it looked and the way it felt better then, but I think I'm just not trying to search for new answers I'm just sticking to what Todd Anderson and I have been working on and just trust that, it may not look good, but I'm hitting the ball well -- and I haven't seen him honestly I haven't seen him in over a month, which is the longest time I haven't seen him.  He went to Michigan for Christmas.
So, yeah, so it's a little un-nerving for me sometimes to not see him before I come out to an event, but like I said we put a lot of hard work, he's done a lot of good stuff with me and I trust that what we're doing is paying off and I just got to stay out of my own way and if I do that I'll be, it will be a good thing.
Q. As a perfectionist is it tough not to search for things if everything's not clicking a hundred percent?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yes and no.  I mean I think more or less it's sort of an image thing in that it doesn't look exactly as perfect as other swings have looked in the past, but when you look at where the club is coming down, what the ball flight's doing, how well the contact is, then that is perfect.  But the image of it and the way it looks may not be perfect, but the spots it needs to be for me to be successful it is where it is and it's in those spots.  So I just got to know that and trust it.
