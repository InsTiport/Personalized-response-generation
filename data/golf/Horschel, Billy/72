Q.   Well done out there.   5 & 4.   Obviously golf was good?
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, I played really good.   I made no bogeys.   I hit every green except for one, and the one I missed I got away with chipping it in.   I played really good. 
    Sneds was just a little off his game today, and that's 5 & 4 right there.
    It was nice to see myself playing well.   I've been playing good the last couple of months and it just hasn't shown up and hopefully this is a format that can give me a kick start and get me going the right direction for the year.

Q.   I know how much you like match play.   Is it important, as you mentioned, to get the game kick started.   What went right for you out there today?
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   I hit the ball really well.   I feel like the last couple of months, the putting and the short game has been good, I just haven't made anything. 
    But I feel like I can always hit the ball better.   I haven't hit it as good as I would say this year as I have in the past.   Hit a couple of bad shots and haven't hit it close enough.   Been working hard the last couple of weeks, found something just sort of to key on at Hilton Head for the next month or two.   It's been working so well.   It's nice. 
    I only missed one green.   I'm not putting any pressure on myself to make up and down for pars, I give myself chances for birdie.   It puts pressure on your opponent to match you.

Q.   How did the golf course play out there today?
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   The golf course is good.   The greens are great.   They roll good.   They're just really slow.   And they look real fast, but they're really slow.   They're bent greens, they have a lot of grain in them.   The firmness, I love the way the firmness is.   But they're putting really slow.   I left a couple of putts short that I thought I made.   I would love to see them get another foot, foot and a half quicker, but I doubt that's going to happen this week. 

Q.   Day 1 of the WGC‑Cadillac Match Play.   We're here with Billy Horschel.   Brandt did not play his best.   You did play excellent golf.   6 birdies on the day.   You only missed one green.   You've been saying all year that you admittedly have not been playing great.   Do you get a sense it's turning around?
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, I feel it's real close.   I started feeling that in the Florida Swing.   But I was still hitting some bad shots that I'm not used to hitting.   I found something in San Antonio and played well there.   It's unfortunate for me to miss the cut.   I guess I should have made that.   I feel really good where my game has been the last month to five weeks.   And it was just not our time. 
    The results haven't shown how good I've been playing.   I feel really good about my game the last month and a half.   I've been working really hard.   Hopefully this format will give me a kick start for the rest of the year. 

Q.   5 & 4 victory over Brandt Snedeker.   Just how good does that feel?
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   It feels good.   Brandt is a good buddy of mine.   Especially, I know he's been playing some pretty good golf. 
    I came out here, and I played really good.   Unfortunately Sneds wasn't on top of his game.   But I played really well.   And 5 & 4, it's always nice to win, doesn't matter what the score is, just as long as you get the victory.

Q.   Six birdies on the card, what did you do particularly well for that?
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   Hit a lot of greens.   My ball‑striking hasn't been where I want it.   I've been working on it the last couple of weeks.   It's starting to finally show.   I missed one green and I chipped in from there.   I hit a lot of good iron shots, controlled my ball flight, gave myself a lot of chances to make birdie. 
    In match play, you want to give yourself as many birdies as you can to put the pressure on your opponent.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   You know, I hit a good wedge shot and I was shocked how far it flew.   And the lie wasn't very great.   And I was just trying to get it within six, seven feet of the hole, and it came out a lot better than it did.   It just hit the hole somehow and just went in.   I haven't holed out this year at all, that was my first hole out, so I was pretty happy about that.
