BILLY HORSCHEL:   Oh, man, I think if you put the ball in the fairway, you got a good chance of going for it, for most guys in the field. 
The second shot's the toughest.   The right bunker is really never a bad spot to be to any of those pins.   Over the green could be a little tougher, depending upon what pin you're hitting to. 
But I think if you can hit a good shot and put it on the green, the majority of the time it's an easy 2â€‘putt.   It's nothing too tricky about the green. 
So, you know what, I can't tell you, because I don't think it's that easy of a hole.   It is an easy hole, but I don't think it's an easy hole to birdie, especially if you're going for it.   Because if you hit a good shot, the wind can gust up and come up short; you carry a little too far and it releases and it bounds back too far past the green. 
So maybe just hitting good iron shots.
