  BILLY HORSCHEL:   I played pretty good today.   Missed some putts.   Need to work on the range, ball striking hasn't been as consistent this year as I would like.   It's not far off.   
Duf, he didn't give much away until the last hole, missed that little putt.   It wasn't easy one like it was yesterday.  
   
 Q.   You won two matches in this format so far.   What kind of confidence does that give you?   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I feel really confident.   I feel like my game has been coming around the last couple of months.   The results just haven't been there.   I haven't made enough putts.   This may be the format that I need to sort of jump start the rest of the season, where you are not worrying about score, you are worrying about playing your opponent.   It's been good so far.   
See what happens tomorrow.   Got a big test tomorrow against McIlroy.   It's going to be a fun match.   I feel confident with my game, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You have beaten Jason Dufner 3 & 2.   Tell us about that match from your point of view.   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Today didn't hit it as well as I would have liked, like I did yesterday.   Played steady golf, gave one hole away on No. 7 with a bad tee shot.   Just did some stupid things from there.   
Overall, it was a good day.   Put some pressure on him.   He made a couple of good par saves and holed out for birdie on 8.   Good day overall.   I need to hit the ball a little better to play McIlroy tomorrow.   I like where my game is.   I'm hitting really good putts.   I wish the greens were a little bit quicker, because I'm leaving them all on the front edge.   I'm happy where my game is, I can't complain at all.   
   
 Q.   How much does your opponent's play affect the way you are technically?  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Not so up much.   The way I strike it, I hit a lot of greens.   Hit a lot of fairways.   So I'm putting pressure on my opponent.   For the most part, I'm just trying to hit a lot of greens and put the pressure back on them.   If they are out of position, they are making a number then I'll be a little bit smarter.   I'll trying to play the best golf and the smartest golf, and not play too much situation golf.   I'll play situation golf at the end, depending on where the match stands.   I'm trying to play really good golf to start off.   
   
 Q.   Excited about the possibilities of tomorrow.   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Rory is best player in the world right now.   I know he's going to be amped up to play me.   I'm going to amped up to play him.   Obviously we've had a track record together.   I think when we play each other, the best golf has come out from both of us.   I wouldn't expect anything less tomorrow.
