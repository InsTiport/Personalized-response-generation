  BILLY HORSCHEL:   It was not a good score today, especially when there was no wind this morning.   My putting was pretty awful.   
So, yeah, not very happy right now.  
   
 Q.   Do you think the players are going to struggle this afternoon with the wind picking up?  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I think the wind is going to pick up and the greens are going to dry out, so I think you're not going to see too many low scores.   
Obviously Miguel was playing good in front of us and Jerry had it going.   I don't see many guys doing it this afternoon.
