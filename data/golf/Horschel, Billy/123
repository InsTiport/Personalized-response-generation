 Q.   We talked this morning.   You were excited about the prospects your first go around.   How would you assess how it all went?  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I played really well today.   I was really amped up this morning and sort of had to calm myself down on the range.   I was getting a little too quick.  
But played really well today.   Played solid.   Made no bogeys.   And it's match play, anything can happen.   Jamie hit a couple of wayward shots and I was able to take advantage of it.  
   
 Q.   It's been awhile since you last played match play.   Was it what you expected and remembered?   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   You know what, yeah.   I think the funniest thing is is being able to give putts and that aspect.   It's just try to go out there and play the best you can.   I think it's a little weird when your opponent hits a bad shot and you try to figure out ‑‑ try to be aggressive, but not too aggressive.   You don't want to leave yourself in a bad spot.   I try to just treat it like a regular round when he was out of position.   I just played well today.   Like I said, I think my game is coming into form and I think today showed it a little bit.   
   
 Q.   How do you continue to control the emotions and aggressiveness yet still try to put the foot on the gas?   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I don't know.   You know, it's just, for me I'm the same.   My emotions are going to be in there.   I've just got to be aware of that sometimes.   Maybe I'm moving a little quicker, maybe swinging a little quicker.   I just need to calm down and take a couple of deep breaths.   
I was in a good spot today.   I didn't hit any bad shots, didn't hit anything that would get me too upset.   I was able to stay pretty level out there.
