Q. Talk about your third round play.BILLY HORSCHEL: I knew today was going to be very similar to yesterday.  Except the wind was going to be a lot less, so there was going to be some very low scores out there.  You're going to have chances to make a lot of birdies. So, I just went out there.  My caddie and I have been doing a really good job thinking this week for a new golf course, trying to be aggressive when we can be and back off a little bit when we need to be. We have a great team around me with Todd Anderson.  He's not here this week, but he did some good work with me last week. And then the stats guy I've been working with this year, Mark Horton, has been a big help.  Not only for myself but for my caddie too, Micah.  Really just showing us the way holes should be played and just better course management. I feel like we have always done a good job beforehand, but I think we do a lot better job with him just having the stats to back up some stuff.Q. How did you process the finish last week to get yourself back in the hunt here this week?BILLY HORSCHEL: I didn't process anything.  It was a bad swing at the wrong time.  I'm a guy who doesn't dwell on a lot of stuff.  I sort of let things roll off my shoulders.  I got some really thick skin, so nothing really bothers me too much. And listen, I'm a better player than what I showed with that golf shot.  I wasn't nervous over it.  I was telling my caddie, you know, when I saw Kirk miss the putt, I said I'm going to hit this on the green, and I'm going to make eagle, and we're going to win this tournament.  And that's just the way I think. There's nothing that I should be down about -- about the way I played last week, and so it wasn't a big deal.  It was nothing to process, nothing to get over, it happens, that's the way golf is.
