Q. So how did you feel about the break from last night until this morning?  Did that have any effect on you?
BILLY HORSCHEL: No, not at all.  I know I was playing two tough holes.  If I could make two pars, I'd be in a decent spot going into the final round.  Luckily enough, I was able to get a birdie on No. 9.  I go out and play a good round, guys up top struggle a little bit, who knows what happens?
Q. Anything in particular you're proud of from that round?
BILLY HORSCHEL: Just hanging in there.
I played really good on the first ten holes and made absolutely nothing.  I just went to the back and then tried forcing things and kept still trying to hit good golf shots and giving myself chances and some putts fell.  When you hit it inside two feet on two holes and have a tap-in birdie on a par 5, you have to make the putts.
