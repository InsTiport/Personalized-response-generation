  BILLY HORSCHEL:   The east coast is a little hot.   Being in Florida at this time of year it's a little warm.   Come out here, put on some sweaters and feel some nice cool air the whole day, it's just a nice atmosphere and I like being out here a lot.  
THE MODERATOR:   Season opening event on TOUR after a phenomenal year last year, including the win in New Orleans.   Just recap the season.   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, obviously recapping the season usually happens in 2014.   You know, it's just been a great year.   Got off to a hot start.   Played really well for the first five, six months of the season, and I got a little burnt out in July and August.  
I just didn't take enough time off a way from the game when I was home.   I was practicing a little too much when I was home and I should have just been resting a little more.  
But started playing well, you know, the last couple events of the FedExCup playoffs, and I feel really good the last three months of season.   I've got five events on my schedule on the PGA TOUR, and looking forward to getting some momentum going into next year.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   You know, the day after TOUR Championship I did a charity event up in (indiscernible.)   Just north of East Lake, and then I went home and just relaxed.   We had some house renovations going on, so I just sort of just was on the coach overseeing stuff, taking naps, not doing much.  
So I took about, you know, five, six, seven days off, and then I started practicing last Monday a little bit.   Was over in Gainsville last weekend.   Haven't been back to Gainsville in a while.   Was able to watch a Gator football game.   Chris DiMarco was Honorary Mr. Two Bits, which is a big deal for Gators.  
I feel rested.   I feel good.   Game is in good shape.   Looking forward to a good week higher.  
   
 Q.   What do you have to do to be Honorary Mr. Two Bits?  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I don't know.   
   
 Q.   You personally.   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Me personally?   
   
 Q.   What else do you have to do in this career?   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   You know, (indiscernible)   (Laughter.)   You know, obviously (indiscernible) a little bit the last year and it's been nice, but (indiscernible)...   
There are a lot more other players, football players, basketball players, other guys in line that certainly deserve to be Mr. Two Bits before I do.   
That's down the road if they keep on having Honorary Mr. Two Bits.   It would be an honor, but I think there are some people ahead of me in line.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I never really looked at the President's Cup standings.   I think it's just understanding myself, understanding when I look at too many things that I can't control, you know, where people play and how they play and where the standings are, I start thinking about it too much.  
I think after I finished the U.S. Open someone told me I was 11th or 12th in the standings, which I knew was good.   I knew I needed one or two more really good wins or top five finishes.   You know, I just had to play well.   
You know, I got a little burnt out.   Got a little tired.   Got a little more emotional on the golf course than I wanted to be.  
Then I knew that I wasn't playing well.   I knew Presidents Cup and the first PGA Championship and the first (indiscernible) FedExCup events were really big.   I knew I needed to do (indiscernible) unless I played really well.   
So I didn't press very much or pay attention too much.   Just trying to play better golf.   Unfortunately wasn't able to do it at that time.   
   
 Q.   How do you avoid burnout?  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I think the reason I was so burnt out is last year I was in the Q School category and I had to play a lot to make sure I was high enough up in the shuffle.  
And then when I won in ZÃ¼rich, it gave me a little chance to take ‑‑ plan my schedule a little bit, so I knocked off one or two events.  
But it's a learning process, and what I learned the best was if I play four events out of six weeks or seven events out of nine or ten weeks, if I come home for two, three weeks, I need to literally get away from the game, not touch a club for five or six days‑ which is tough because I feel like I'm losing something.  
For me, I found out that's the best way for me to get away from the game, because it's a more mental thing than physical thing, take my mind off it, not worrying about the swing or trying to get better at this or that.   Just getting my mind a way from the game of golf.   
   
 Q.   (Question regarding fall schedule.)  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Obviously I'm playing this week, then in Malaysia/China.   I'll come home for two weeks and I'm going to play the Phoenix event.   Come home for two more weeks and play The Shark Shootout.  
Then go snowboarding week after.   I'll come home for four or five days for Christmas, and then off to Kapalua.   So it's not much‑‑ there are a lot of other guys taking more time off.   I played a lot already this year, so just decided it was sort of pointless to take the rest of the year off.  
There are some opportunities I'm going to take advantage of.   I'll take advantage of them this year, and then next year I'll plan my schedule accordingly to give myself some more time off.  
Like I said, there are more guys‑‑ you know, I may be the only one who made the TOUR Championship that is here this week.  
   
 Q.   Jerry is here.   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Okay, Jerry is here.   So, you know, not many guys that made the TOUR Championships are playing in the next few weeks.   I know some guys are going to Malaysia/China, and that's it.   I like playing.   I want to play.   I don't like sitting all home and not doing anything.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   You know, it factored a lot.   I played well here two years in a row.   Last year I think I was in a pretty good position going into the last 36 holes and had a bad Saturday or something.   But played well here.   
Like I say, just cool surroundings.   The Frys guys put on a heck of a tournament.   Everything they do here is first class.   Duke Butler, the president of the tournament, after I won Zurich, asked me if I was still going to come to Frys.   I said, I am, dude.   I'll commit to you right now.  
You know, some guys are asking why I'm even here this week.   I said, I committed to Mr.Butler, who's a family friend.   I know his son Duke really well.   I honor my word very well.   If I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do something.   
I felt like if I backed out on that I felt like it would be the wrong thing to do.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
BILLY HORSCHEL:   You know, I'm still learning.   The first couple years out here on tour I was in limbo with my status being in Q‑School and being conditional.   So I had to play as much as I can.  
This is the first year that I played this many tournaments.   So it's learning process.   Just like the next few years will be a learning process.   Understanding how many tournaments I can play and how many weeks I need off, it's all just a process of trying to learn and get better.  
Sometimes it's not getting better at golf, it's getting better on your off weeks at what you do at home and taking time off.   Like I said, I'm always trying to learn.   I haven't figured out that optimal time off or anything yet, but I think I have a good idea.   
I like to play two or three weeks in a row, and then I need to take two weeks off after that where the first week off I'm just home relaxing and not touching a club.   And then I'll rev it back up before I come back out.
