Q.   Three birdies today, does that give you a little momentum for heading into Sunday?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yes, it does.   I needed it because I actually played really well for most of the round.   I just didn't‑‑ fortunately I hit some good shots on the front side and got rewarded for it with the wind dying down and the ball landing real soft on the greens compared to the last couple of days.
I hung in there, I made some good par saves at 14 and 15.   I told my caddie, Micah, we need to make at least two birdies coming in.   It was nice to make three.   I'm right there where I need to be going into tomorrow.

Q.   A golf course this difficult, I mean 1‑ or 2‑under is great.   Are you getting some confidence in your game this week?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, I'm really confident right now.   I feel like it's been close for a while.   And I just needed to see some results and I've seen it this week.   And I'm hitting some really good shots.   I'm swinging well.   The misses I've had the last couple of months is gone now.   And I'm excited about tomorrow.   I needed some momentum going to Augusta and the rest of this year.   And it was nice to see it finally showing up. 

Q.   You struggled so hard for a 1‑under score?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I didn't really feel it was that much of a struggle.   Played better than I felt like, that's for sure. 

Q.   1‑under, 71.   Quite a struggle out there. 
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, it was.   You know, the wind blew about 10 to 20 today, so we had some gusts.   I actually played pretty well on the front side.   I hit some really good shots and got rewarded for it.   Some balls landed softly on the greens and spun, which was unusual, compared to the last two days.
You hit a shot going hard downwind, the wind would be following you right as you hit it, so the ball wouldn't go as far as you'd expect it.
A little struggle on the front side.   On the backside made some bad swings.   I made some good pars on 14 and 15 to at least limit some damage.   And I said let's make some birdies on the last couple of holes on the backside or the last few holes, to my caddie, Micah, and I was happy to make three.

Q.   How did you do that?   The whole day you're struggling making a birdie and you knock off three in a row?
BILLY HORSCHEL:   I felt like I had opportunities, the putts were just sliding by.   I went through a stretch there where I wasn't giving myself opportunities.
It was nice, I wanted to give myself opportunities coming in.   16 being the toughest one to make, because it was blowing so hard downwind and the greens were‑‑ that green has been pretty firm all week.   It was nice to get one there.   And they had the tees up on 17 and 18, just straight downwind today.   It was nice to make three birdies, and I feel like I'm right where I need to be going into tomorrow.
