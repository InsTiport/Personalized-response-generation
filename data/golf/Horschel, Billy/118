 Q.   Billy, an assessment of your day?   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, it was a struggle today.   Didn't warm up very well today and didn't hit it very good.   I scrapped it together on the front side, and probably should have shot two shots better.   I missed some short putts at 2 and 7 for birdie that I need to make.   Then to the back side I started hitting it all over the map.   Unfortunate because I was sort of holding it together.   
I knew anything under par was going to be okay, and bad bogey at 15, then just a bad tee shot and double bogey, unfortunately.   That's the way it goes.   We've been playing in a lot of wind last week.   I knew early in the week that my swing, just the sequencing was just a touch off.   You know, obviously, when you play in this wind and you miss just a little bit, your errors are a little bit further off.  
   
 Q.   When you saw some of the scores put up early today, were you thinking maybe I can get 6‑ or 7‑under like some of these guys?   
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Oh, no.   Every score that was good was in the morning or every score that was low came in the morning.   I know there were a couple guys playing this afternoon, but they played in completely different conditions than us.   Soft greens, good greens.   I know wind is a good factor for low rounds.   We come out here and it's blowing 15, 20, and greens get a little bumpy, but that's not an issue.   Just the wind makes it a little tougher to score.   
That's the way it goes sometimes.   You get on the wrong side of the draw, and it works out that way.   Maybe we can get no wind tomorrow early in the morning for us, and the wind can pick back up in the afternoon and make it fair for everybody.
