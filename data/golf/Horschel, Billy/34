 Q.  Billy, good tournament.  I know you want to win but considering what happened yesterday, to be able to play out there today, at least you had a chance.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Yeah.  Exactly.  That's all I could ask for.  It's a big ass miracle that we got this round in today.  The staff here at Aronimink and PGA TOUR staff did unbelievable job with the golf course and somewhat shape to play.  It was, it was fun to play and I had my opportunities there on the backside and, unfortunately, I knew when I bogeyed 15 I sort of put myself behind the 8 Ball, had to go birdie, birdie, birdie the last three and I had opportunities.  I didn't hit the green on 17, 18 but I hit two good chips I thought were in the hole.   
 Q.  You know what it's like to come from behind to get into the Tour Championship and have to win the FedExCup.  
 You're there, you know what it takes to win on that golf course.  How much has your play over the last couple months really helped?   
BILLY HORSCHEL: It's helped a lot.  You know, if I go back to 2017 and even a little bit the first few months of this year were sort of a struggle and it's unbelievable because I worked my ass off and not to get the results I've wanted, it's sort of frustrating.   
You know, we've done a lot of good work with Todd Anderson, Brett McKay, a sports psychologist, some really good work with me.  My team has done and unbelievable job to stick through some tough times that were bad, not that bad.  Not being able to play to my ability I get very frustrated, very easily.  The results that we've seen the last few months is due to that hard work but also due to hard work from the last year and a half.   
 Q.  Really good effort this week, good finish, good luck in a couple weeks in Atlanta.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Thank you very much.   
 Q.  How much of today and not being able to play yesterday just about embracing the challenge and having the right attitude to come out, even play your best and to get it going.  
BILLY HORSCHEL: Exactly.  There's a lot of guys that didn't want to play today.  Hopefully it will be a 54 hole event or something.  So, yeah, you know, I was just say hey, hey, I was ready to play when they told us to go to play.  That's what I did.  I sort of play well when we have delays and this and that.  Calms me down.  I don't know when we're going to go play so I can't get myself worked up.  When we do go play, okay, you got to go play now.   
It's unknown.  So, when you know -- when I know something, I can get myself worked up, get myself too anxious, too ready to go play and so this is just -- you know, so you just sort of sit around and just wait and that's it .
