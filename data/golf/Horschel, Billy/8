  Q. You close it out here on 16; you knew what you had to do today and you did it.
 BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, I did.  It was unfortunate I didn't play very good yesterday against J.T. and J.T. played a really solid round of golf.  I think over the first two days of match play I've given way too many holes away, just where guys didn't have to do much.  I was making bogeys, and so today my goal was not to give a hole away.  Did a really good job of that.  No bogeys on this card.  I think I made four birdies, and it was a really good match between me and Collin.
 It could have gone either way.  I made a few putts there, just past the turn, and he missed his.  It was a good match, and like I said, I knew what I needed to do today, and I've got the win now.  It's out of my hands.
 Q. Thoughts on the course setup today?  Obviously a little different than yesterday.
 BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, you know, this course I think compared to what we're normally used to seeing, the greens are a little softer and maybe a touch slower in the green speed.  We're not used to seeing the ball spin back so much, and even when we're playing for it, it's still spinning back a lot.  I think the course setup has been great this week.  We've had a couple different wind directions.
 It's a great match play course.  I think from the first time I stepped foot on it in 2016 was our first year here maybe, I thought it was a perfect match play course, and I love coming back here.
