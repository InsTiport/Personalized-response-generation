Q.   Tell me about 18? 
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   I hit a good drive.   I don't think it got as far out as it did in the practice round.   But I only had maybe 215 to the flag, 205 front.   So it's just a nice solid 4.   You can't really go out there 5, because if you land it online, if it's a yard short, it's bouncing over the green.   So you've got to play to the left. 
    I hit a good shot, wound up 25 feet to the left, and I had two bad lip outs on 15 and 17 for birdie.   So my caddy's like, if you make this one and make a good putt, we're in the hole.   And he said, told you you'd make that.   So, yeah, it was a good, solid day to day.

Q.   Did you feel like you were overdue on putts?
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   I actually hit a lot of good putts today.   That one makes up for those two.   But, I hit a lot of good putts today.   Some went in, some didn't.   Obviously, the Poa Annua greens you get some bounces once in a while, so it's a little weird.   But I don't think I was overdue on putts, no.

Q.   You know that you have to take advantage of this golf course, right? 
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah.   It's weird because I played it Monday, and it was playing really fast and firm.   Usually you have to go low on this side just to feel like you didn't lose any ground to the field. 
    Played Monday, and I'm thinking, man, it may not be that low because some of the greens are really firm, the ball is bouncing.   We're used to just hitting and stopping.   And I think a little bit of the moisture from last night and the overcast day sort of kept the greens a little‑‑ the moisture in the greens so it didn't really get firm, and the greens weren't as fast as when I played in the practice round on Monday. 
    So I think I sort of adjusted mindset a little bit, and adjusted to the way the greens were reacting a little bit compared to what I played on Monday.

Q.   Is that firing at the flags more or just being a little more aggressive? 
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   Being a little bit more aggressive than what I figured we may have to be on this course early in the week because it was so firm.   Usually you can land it by the hole and just stop.   On Monday, when I played here, you end up five, six yards short of the pin, and it bounced one time, maybe a second time it stopped or it had a little good bounce to it.   Then I realized, they weren't really bouncing that much, maybe a small bounce, but nothing crazy that we're not used to. 
    So I just started being a little more aggressive with some shots that you have.   When you get some nice shots, you have to take advantage of that, and did I a good job of that today.

Q.   Tell me about the South Course and how it sets up for you? 
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   I like it.   These two courses set up well.   I drive it pretty straight, and if I can just keep the ball on the fairway, I'm playing good right now.   I can't lie.   My game feels pretty good.   So if I can just keep putting the ball on the fairway and it's something I do very well, I think I can take advantage of the South Course when I have the opportunity to. 
    Obviously, you've got to be smart when you go at a flag and when you don't, so we'll see what the South Course has in store tomorrow.

Q.   Have you focused on the off‑season for the early start because of the golf courses or it's just important to the schedule? 
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   I didn't do anything last season.

Q.   Really? 
    BILLY HORSCHEL:   I had no time off last year.   Playing conditional status, I played 17 events out on TOUR, and I think I played maybe five or six on the Web.com, several Monday qualifiers.   So there was a lot of never knew when you were going to be playing, so you always had to be ready to go. 
    So after Q‑school, I had to do a couple functions, a couple charity events that I had already planned on doing.   Went snowboarding for a week, loved it, could have spent another two months out there.   Came back, took another week off, and then I started practicing just before New Year's.   There wasn't a lot of time preparing for the beginning of the season, but I didn't feel like I needed it because I was playing so well at the end of the year, and I could take a couple of weeks off and come back and feel pretty good with the game. 
    I've just been working hard.   I had my teacher out in Palm Springs last week.   Todd Anderson, he works with Brandt Snedeker and Ben Kohles out here, so we were able to do some good work and carried it over to this week, and we'll see what happens the rest of the week.
