  Q. Up early and able to hold off a feisty Kevin Streelman down the stretch.  Match play can be a funny thing.  You can being aggressive or you can be conservative.  What strategy did you have out there today?
 BILLY HORSCHEL:   Just played my game.  I mean, I've tried in the past to play super aggressive and comes to bite me in the butt.  I think for more or less I just play like it would be a stroke play.  What are we gone do with this shot?  How are we going to try and get it close?
 Maybe there are certain times where you try to get a little aggressive depending on what your playing partner does, but it's more or less how would I attack this golf course in a stroke play format.
 Q. You've never advanced out of the group stage here at Austin Country Club.  Not only did you advance, but you've gone on to the quarterfinals.  If you could pinpoint one or two things you're doing well this year compared to years past, what would it be?
 BILLY HORSCHEL:   I think I've played well here.  Just haven't finished off matches.  I think a couple years ago I had Jordan Spieth three or four down and we wind up tying the match.
 So I think this week my wedge play is pretty good.  You got a lot of shots inside 150, I've done a really good job controlling the distances for the most part.
 I'm a really good putter inside ten feet and I think in match play that's a big advantage.  I think you saw it today.  I was able to make the putts inside ten feet and Streels missed a few, which allowed me to be victorious.
 Q. In tight there for some fairly easy putts.  Your thoughts on the match?
 BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, it was a good match.  Streels never gave me any hole.  I don't think either of us made a bogey until right here.
 So it was a match where he wasn't giving me holes.  I had to hit good shots and make some putts.  He didn't make some of the putts, so that's the reason I won.  I was able to make the putts and he wasn't.
 Q. Maybe one of the key holes was 14.  He had won 13 and during the left fairway.  (Wind interference?)
 BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, you know, 13 was the drivable par-4 and I've always just laid up there.  I just don't think -- at worst you're going to have 15 feet for birdie.  (Wind interference) so worry about the spin on that hole.  I tried taking an extra club to keep it off.  Just hit it too hard.
 Yeah, fairway bunkers are something I think I do a very good job out of.  That's what my coach says.  I shoot better out of fairway bunkers than I do from the fairway.
 So it was perfect.  We had a good number with just a nice flighted draw 7-iron and hit a good shot in there and Kevin didn't hit a good shot, so gave my an open door to grab that hole back that I lost previous.
 I thought the match would be over on 15.  I knew he hit a good shot in there.  I thought my wedge was pretty good, but two yards too short.
 Q. Tommy Fleetwood  your next match.  Thoughts on that match?
 BILLY HORSCHEL:   Tommy is a great player.  We know what he does, what he's done over the last few years.  He's a great ball-striker and I expect him to hit some really good golf shots.
 I think it's going to be a fun match and see what happens.
