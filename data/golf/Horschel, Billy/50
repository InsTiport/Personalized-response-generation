BILLY HORSCHEL: Made the turn at 3-under, not birdieing No. 4 and 7, which are probably playing the easiest holes today, downwind par 5s.  Then I made a bad bogey on 10.  3-putted 16.
A little disappointed because what I threw away, five shots there, I'm at 3-under; 8-under, make a couple more birdies, who knows, I could have been in a better position to win this thing.
But you know, a lot of momentum this week.  Kept the positive vibe going.  We're going into next week where I've played well.
Q. Let's talk strategy a little bit, because you've been in a similar situation back in 2014, your rank is about the same in the FedExCup.  What do you have to do from here on out?
BILLY HORSCHEL: I need to get a victory.  I really need a win to at least give myself a chance to control my own destiny.  That's the big thing.  Getting to THE TOUR Championship is great and it gives you an opportunity to win the FedExCup, $10 million.  But you're in a better spot if you're in the top five or Top-10.  I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes.
Like I said, I feel really good with my game.  I'm going to Deutsche Bank where I've played well, and see what happens.
