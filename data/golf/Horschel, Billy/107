Q.   Nice week for you. 
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, it was.   Obviously getting off to the bad start on Thursday, 5‑over after five, and finishing the tournament at 4‑under, so yeah, it was good.   Could have been a little better day.   I had some putts on the back side that lipped out, but like I said, I've been saying for a while my game is starting to come around, and I like the ball going in the hole, which I've seen a lot this week. 

Q.   You hit really good putts on 16 and 17, a couple lip‑outs, or as mentioned, it could have been even better here in the final round. 
BILLY HORSCHEL:   Yeah, I did.   I had opportunities.   I birdied 9 and 10 and had opportunities at 11, 12 and 13 and just didn't get it in the hole.   I could have birdied 16 and 17 easily and just lipped out, and it would have been icing on the cake to make that one on 18 from 100 feet or something.   That would have been really nice.   Like I said, it was a good week all in all, saw a lot of good, positive signs, put three decent rounds together.   Unfortunately didn't play very good yesterday, didn't put the ball in the fairway, but it's good.   Got two weeks off now, going to work hard in the game, and like I said, there's still a lot of season left, just the round didn't form the way I wanted to.

Q.   Tell us some things we should be looking out for as this round progresses. 
BILLY HORSCHEL:   If the wind doesn't pick up, I think you're going to see a lot of birdies out here.   The greens are firming up a little bit, but you've got a lot of collection pins, you've got 4, 6 and 9, easy birdies there I feel like, and then you get over to‑‑ 12 is right there in front, 11 is an easy par‑5, there's no wind really, maybe a touch into us, and then 13 you've got an 8‑iron to that left pin, you've got that slope you can use, and then 16 and 17, I mean, I think‑‑ and even 18.   18's pin is birdieable.   I think you're going to see a lot of birdies out here, but the greens are finally picking up some pace and getting a little firmer, which we've been waiting for all week.
