 Q.   Just your thoughts?  
CAMERON WILSON:   Yeah, I can't say anything more than that.   It was a thrill.   I really would have liked to play better.   But I think when I look back on it it was a great experience.   It was great to beat a Stanford guy so close to home and hopefully for some money.  
   
 Q.   Do you guys play here at all?  
CAMERON WILSON:   Just once or twice a year.  
   
 Q.   Does that help at all?  
CAMERON WILSON:   I was more comfortable with the golf course, but it's such a different golf course than what it normally is.  
   
 Q.   Talk about getting here.   It was a bit of a challenge getting here and qualifying?  
CAMERON WILSON:   There was a bunch of weather.   There was I think one rain delay, and I went back to New Jersey from California, because I like the golf course.   But I played really well.   I qualified by two or three shots.  
   
 Q.   Does that affect your approach here?  
CAMERON WILSON:   No, I think once you get here you forget all about that.   
   
 Q.   Are you disappointed at all today?  
CAMERON WILSON:   Yeah, I would have liked to have played better.   
   
 Q.   What was it you needed to do?  
CAMERON WILSON:   I hit the ball pretty poorly all week, I would say.   I think being in school so late in the year hampered my preparation a little bit.  
   
 Q.   What was that thing, you had to move out of your dorm room this week?  
CAMERON WILSON:   My parents moved me out of my dorm room.   But I had some exams and a paper that I had to turn in Wednesday morning.  
   
 Q.   Did you get it done?  
CAMERON WILSON:   Well, I did, but I think that those demands on my time didn't let me prepare as well as I would have liked to.  
   
 Q.   What was the subject, what was the class?  
CAMERON WILSON:   You don't want to know.   It would take me too long to put in a story.
