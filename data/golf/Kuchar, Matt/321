   MATT KUCHAR: Looked like I might have saw a bogey on 10. Other than that, you know, looked like some real solid golf, from shearly scoreboard watching. He's playing some great golf right now.

 Q. After what happened to him at the Masters, is there a sense that you might cheer a little bit for him tomorrow?
 MATT KUCHAR: It certainly is a great story. It is something that you feel for a guy having what happened to him at the Masters, and you'd like to see a guy like that bounce back. It looked like the very next week, I can't remember where he played in Europe, but it seemed like he bounced back pretty well, had a solid week. What he did here at the U.S. Open is dominating, impressive work.

 Q. Did the course setup in any way surprise you, as far as the tees being moved up on a bunch of holes as much as they were?
 MATT KUCHAR: 18, I wasn't expecting 18 to be up. Other than that nothing surprised me. It was a pleasant surprise to walk up to 18 and not have to go another 50 yards back. That was awfully nice to see.
