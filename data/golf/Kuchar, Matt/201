  MATT KUCHAR:   I played steady golf for four days.   Pretty great playing I had today for four rounds.  
   
 Q.   What happened on the shot to 18 in regulation?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I knew I needed par to win.   I didn't want to bail out right and figured I'd try to hit a good shot and just a little too far left, unfortunately.   One of those things.   It's smarter to bail out and give yourself a chance, but I was looking to try to make 4 and win the tournament.  
   
 Q.   You go to Augusta with a 4th place finish and 2nd place finish and lots of momentum headed into the Masters.  
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah.   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Matt Kuchar falls just short on this 18th hole here at the Shell Houston Open and for you, Matt, tell me about the final shot in on the playoff here.   You hit a great drive.  
MATT KUCHAR:   I knew Matt had birdied 18 to get it to 16-under -- 15-under.   I figured it was to win.   I was looking to hit a good shot.   Didn't want to bail out in the right bunker.   Looking back you can make par from the right bunker and not from the water.   I tugged it a little too much.  
   
 Q.   Overall, Matt had to do quite a bit of things to beat you here today.   Do you feel at least a little bit better that the guy really had to step up to the 18th hole to beat you there?  
MATT KUCHAR:   You got to feel good about it.   Certainly fantastic stuff to birdie 18 twice.   That's probably the hardest hole on the golf course, and for him to put two 3s is pretty impressive stuff.  
   
 Q.   You said winning breeds confidence heading into the Masters.   You didn't win the last two times here.   What's your confidence level going into the first Major?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Hoping to keep improving.   I had a 4th and 2nd.   Hoping to keep the train going.
