Q.   Talk about your round. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Is it was a long days are starting this morning at 8:45, had three holes to play, finishing up 18 in the conditions we had this afternoon were really demanding.   Felt like a survival contest and 2â€‘over par, I'm actually pretty pleased.

Q.   How do you deal with the wind like this?
MATT KUCHAR:   I don't know that there's a whole lot of preparation.   I think everybody has a certain game they play with.   I mean, I feel like I managed pretty well in the way that I don't spin the ball a whole lot so to be in great control in the wind, kind of the less spin the easier it is. 
So that's the game I play and the game I brought out today.   I drove it for the most part pretty well and was able to hit a decent amount of greens.   You're never going to hit a huge number when the wind is blowing this hard.   Pars were a great score.   If you could just finish a hole with par, you're doing well.

Q.   A lot of guys talked about how fair the test is; did pin placements border on not being fair?
MATT KUCHAR:   I don't know if I would say pin placements.   There were a few times during the day where I think a lot of guys would have thought we teetered on the greens with the balls possibly moving.   It felt like you would stand over a putt and the ball would oscillate and just be ready to roll away.   So that was the one bit that seemed close but I never had a ball actually move position due to the wind.
