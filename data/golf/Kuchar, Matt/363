 Q. Can you talk about that round? You nearly made it up to the lead again. 
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, played great golf. It was difficult again. The wind was blowing maybe a steady 20 miles an hour all day. Seemed like a lot of difficult shots, a lot of side winds out there that were hard to figure out if it was straight from the side or hurting or helping. It was tough, and I knew there would be some separation today, guys would separate themselves with some good scores, and I was happy to post one of those good scores today.

 Q. Did you have those conditions all day?
 MATT KUCHAR: All day, all day long.

 Q. What started to turn things around like around 14? 
 MATT KUCHAR: I felt like it was solid golf all day. I felt like there was no real thing to turn around. I've been playing good for a couple weeks now. I felt like from the first tee I played some good golf.

 Q. Are you starting to get more comfortable being a marked man, for lack of a better term, playing in the varsity match-ups at the back of the day, Sunday and Monday this week?
 MATT KUCHAR: I was talking to Stricker a little bit about the Ryder Cup and asking him if it's as nervous as people make it out to be, if there's that much pressure and if the nerves are as strong as what people say, and he said, you know, there are some times where the nerves get you, but people make it out to be maybe a little more jittery and nerve-wracking, and I told him out here I feel like the longer I've been out here, the more years I've played, the easier hitting that opening tee shot becomes, the easier that getting in contention becomes, that the nerves maybe aren't as intense. I think they'll always be there. 
 I played a practice round with Tom Watson at the British Open, and he mentioned for all of his wins he continued to get nervous, that you never stop getting nervous. But I think it becomes a little easier with the routine. If you do it over and over again, I think it does get a little easier. 

 Q. When you're on a roll like that, is it as easy as it looks? 
 MATT KUCHAR: Golf is a hard game. Golf is a hard game, there's no doubt about it. That's why I love it is because it's so hard. I've been going well, but there's no doubt that I'm working hard to make it that way at the same time. 

 Q. You're playing like you're trying to get promoted up to the next league, Nationwide to here, here to whatever the next one would be. 
 MATT KUCHAR: There do seem to be those steps, even amongst your -- you're on the PGA TOUR, but there's the top 125 guys, there's the top 70 guys, there's the top 30 guys, and there's that upper echelon, and it's fun to be kind of getting up to that level.
