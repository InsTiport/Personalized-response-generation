Q.   Not a bad end to the day.
MATT KUCHAR:   No, I got going a little slow at first, even par on the front nine and then bogey on 11.   Fortunately things picked up pretty quickly with I think four birdies in a row, 12, 13, 14, 15 was a helpful stretch and then made a bomb on 18, so it was a great finish.

Q.   Can you talk about 18 and the putt?
MATT KUCHAR:   It was tough.   The green is completely in the shade, so I haven't had a look at the break is difficult.   Shade comes over.   All the kind of breaks go away and I had my caddie actually take a look at it, and I never call him in.   He took a look.   We got a similar read, and fortunately I had a good feel for what I thought was going to do and got it on a good lie and just kept trickling, went all the way in.

Q.   You've talked about how familiar this course is to you.   How comfortable did you feel when you started going on this streak again?
MATT KUCHAR:   I think this is just a great course.   I think if you're playing well, you can make birdies, and I think if you're not playing well, the course is going to penalize you.   I think we saw that with some good scores out there as well as some really bad scores.
I think it's just a sign of a very good course, so I was doing some good things out there and feel very comfortable out here.

Q.   Obviously tomorrow the score can go low again.   The winner can go low.   How do you feel coming into Sunday?
MATT KUCHAR:   Glad I made that last putt.   I'm happy to be a little closer, within range to have a chance.   I think it's definitely going to take a low round tomorrow.   I think everybody up there is playing well and I think going to continue to play well, so somebody's going to have to go low to win tomorrow.

Q.   Your family here, your grandparents specifically?   Did they come today?
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, yeah, they sure did.   They sure did.

Q.   Were those cheers for your grandfather or for you today?   What did he say?
MATT KUCHAR:   I heard some of both.   I heard some cheers for little Kuch.   They know big Kuch is around.

Q.   Does it mean a lot for you to be in contention here with your grandfather ‑‑
MATT KUCHAR:   It's exciting.   It's a little extra special.   I think it would be a lot of fun to make a good run tomorrow, particularly with him living just down the road.

Q.   Do you think you got kind of lucky there with that grouping, some pretty exciting guys.   Did that give you a lot of energy throughout the round today?
MATT KUCHAR:   Fun to play with Webb?   Webb just exciting to play with.   He's the Open champion.   A fun guy.   Even before he won the Open, always a fun paring, and same with Baddeley.   It was exciting.   We had a good gallery following us, and that's fun to have.   It's fun to have that excitement around a round of golf.

Q.   Thanks, Matt.
