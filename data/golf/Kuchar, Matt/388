   JOHN BUSH: Welcome Matt Kuchar into the interview room. Matt, a second consecutive 9-under par, 63. Great playing the first two days. If we could just get some comments on your round today.
 MATT KUCHAR: Thank you. It's not often that you can follow up a 63 with another 63. My caddie was talking midway through the round, and he says, Man, you gotta keep making birdies so we can sleep in after the Timberlake concert tonight. Was fun out there today. I think no bogeys today, that's always a nice thing to not have on your card. The game is good. The last few weeks I've missed a couple cuts, but really been making some adjustments and working with my instructor, Chris O'Connell and things have been going well. Things are starting to pay off.
 JOHN BUSH: Talk a little bit about that the finish. Five birdies on the last seven holes. That's not a bad way to finish the round. 
 MATT KUCHAR: No, you've got a stretch there of definitely some birdie opportunities, a drivable par-4 and a reachable par-5. I strung together a couple other nice ones. The last one at 18 I hit a 7-iron from about 180 to, gosh, a foot and a half. 
 So there are a few in there that I wasn't counting on making birdies, but definitely some opportunities out there. 
 JOHN BUSH: Talk a little bit about your season so far this year and your goals for the last few weeks of the season.
 MATT KUCHAR: I've been pretty happy overall with the season. I went probably a little more than the first half of the year playing some awfully good golf and very few missed cuts. I went through a stretch of I think five missed cuts in a row, but was really -- knew I had my card up working towards getting better for '09. 
 Just putting some work in, and right now it's looking like I'm ready to go and excited for '09, but hoping to finish '08 on a strong note.
 JOHN BUSH: All right. Questions. 

 Q. Just wondered, you had an identical score from yesterday. Did you feel the conditions were about identical from yesterday as well?
 MATT KUCHAR: Conditions were just about identical. I mean, just perfect weather, very slight hint of a wind. I think the greens this morning were a little easier to putt than yesterday afternoon. You play late in the afternoon and they start getting bumpy and spiked out. 
 Aside from that, the greens overall are very good. I think you can take advantage a little more in the morning rounds than you can in the afternoon when they start getting a little bit more bumpy.

 Q. What does this time of year mean to you? As far as trying to get another win and things like that, what does this time of year mean?
 MATT KUCHAR: Certainly for guys that have their card wrapped up, it's trying to end the year on a high note, trying to get a win, trying to get another win for some people. 
 For me, that's exactly what it is. Got the card wrapped up for next year, so really trying to go after winning golf tournaments, and then put some work in on making some swing changes. 
 You really don't like to take those out to a new year without being battle tested. So, you know, trying to test them at the end the year and then figure out what else we need to work on the on the off-season to get ready for '09. 
 Bit really it helps to finish on a high note. Any time I can finish the year feeling like you played well, I think you go into the next year all that more excited and better ready.

 Q. Can you talk specifically about the changes, when you started making them and why and what you've been working on?
 MATT KUCHAR: I've been working with a guy, Chris O'Connell, a Jim Hardy disciple, the one-plane technique. Just really trying to get that down more and more. 
 It's kind of a fine tuning. My swing has a lot of the one-plane properties, but we're tweaking on more right now trying to -- I don't know how it describe it. Instead of having my hips go more towards the ball, having my hips go more down the target line. So it's more moving my right hip up the target line and not towards the golf ball is kind of one principle. It helps me do a few other things, helps me get the club more on plane.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MATT KUCHAR: Always try to get better. I think that's the nature of this game, is we're always trying to get better. I think we get together kind of every month or two months, and always are trying to just make simple little changes and trying to always get better. 
 This game seems to be a never-ending process of trying to get better.
 JOHN BUSH: Talk about what your mindset has to be on the weekend. 18-under par through two rounds, and you just can't let up this weekend, can you? 
 MATT KUCHAR: No, you can't let up. That's the mindset, is you're just gonna have to keep the accelerator down. You have to make a lot more birdies. Who knows what the magical number will be. Just kind of got to keep the gas pedal down and try not to get passed. There's certainly going to be some more low numbers shot.
 JOHN BUSH: Any of the birdies stand out today?
 MATT KUCHAR: I think just the last one was the most fun, putting to a foot and a half. I made my only bogey yesterday on 18. It was good to get back with a birdie today was the best. 
 No, I didn't have any long putts today, just some solid golf.
