 Q. Great playing today. You got yourself right in the mix as you're heading into the weekend, just one off the lead. Just kind of tell us when you're in that position, what's your thought process tonight as you head in?
 MATT KUCHAR: I'm awfully glad to have finished tonight. It would have been an early morning and then a big delay, I think, had we not finished, so it was nice. No real thought process. The game is the same, it doesn't change, and I'll go out the same as I did the crack of drawn on Thursday and the same as I did on Friday. So hopefully good things continue and the putts continue to fall.

 Q. What is it about this course that suits your game?
 MATT KUCHAR: It's funny, I was planning on not playing here. I was hitting the ball very well at Sony, very well last week at the Hope, and it kind of was a last-minute commitment. I was supposed to be skiing this week. I said, I'm going to postpone the ski trip, play here, and I'm awfully glad I made that decision. I was planning on skipping it, so I don't know that I'd say this course is tailor-made for me, but hoping to have a good weekend.
