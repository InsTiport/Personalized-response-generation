   MATT KUCHAR: A little disheartening. I was playing some great golf and finally got a chance to look at the leaderboard. Stricker was matching me shot for shot out there. I felt like I really had it going and a little disappointing to drop a couple coming in, but it's a tough golf course. Right now it's playing firm and fast, and just keeping the ball on the greens is a challenge.

 Q. What's your mindset? Obviously he's the guy you probably will be chasing tomorrow. Just your mindset, anything can happen, I guess?
 MATT KUCHAR: This course is tough enough that if you've got it going a little bit off it can hurt you. But looks like Strick has got it all, and it's going to take a low number for anybody to knock Steve Stricker tomorrow to have a chance. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 MATT KUCHAR: I still hit a lot of drivers. I probably hit more drivers than most guys.
