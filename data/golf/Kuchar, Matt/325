  Q. Had a good round out there today. Tell us about it.   
 MATT KUCHAR: It was good, very good. I was 4-under through 13 and then 15 and 16 got me, but those are hard holes. I thought I hit a really good drive on 18, and to par that hole was a nice feeling. It would have been nice if I kept it at 4-under, but I'm pretty happy with 2-under. I got back to even par. Not really sure how it's going to shake out, but should at least have a distant shot at it tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What is the mindset going into tomorrow?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Hopefully make a lot of birdies. To have a chance in a major championship is an exciting thing, and I think the position I'll be in will be pretty far back. But nice to at least have an opportunity and hopefully will go out and -- the front side provides a few more birdie opportunities, and you want to get those definitely before you get to the 15th hole.  
  
  Q. The first three days it looked like the same areas kind of got you a little bit. Have you learned anything you think you can apply to tomorrow to kind of get that back?  
 MATT KUCHAR: I don't know. I finally played the 12th hole well. This is the first day I made birdie there. I felt like I was giving away a lot of shots there on Thursday by making a double bogey on 12. I actually made a birdie there. I feel like the game is getting better with each day.  
  
  Q. You seem to have a good comfort level on these Georgia courses. What's it like playing here in your hometown?  
 MATT KUCHAR: It's nice, all the sport. They're excited to see Georgia Tech here, the kid with Georgia ties doing really well.
