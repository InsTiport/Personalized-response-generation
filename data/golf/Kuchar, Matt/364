 Q. Nice round today, 5-under par. 
 MATT KUCHAR: It was great to birdie the last, particularly after that hour rain delay. You never know how you're going to come out, and just to make a 3 on No. 9 is a good score. So 5-under was good. Considering all the congratulatory stuff, all the stuff that goes on after winning a tournament, the next week it's hard to continue good play. But I was happy to have an opening round of 5-under par.

 Q. Tell me about the rest of your day out there. How did it start? How did it go?
 MATT KUCHAR: It started off slow and then started making a few putts. I made a good up-and-down on No. 14, which was our fifth hole, and then after that got it going pretty good and made some putts and played some steady golf except for the double bogey on the 14th hole. 

 Q. Everything from last week has kind of carried over?
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it's been steady. Had a steady year, had a consistent year. I feel like if I'm not playing that well, I'm still keeping it in play and doing some good things, so it's been a steady year. I feel like the play has just continued on to be pretty good.

 Q. I know you're real humble and a gracious winner, but you can go ahead and be greedy in the FedExCup. 
 MATT KUCHAR: I'll tell you what, it would be one heck of a celebration, but until that point I'm going to stay humble and try not to think about it.
