Q.   What an impressive day today.   The wind and conditions on the golf course made it very difficult.   A 69 today.   The up‑and‑down you had on 18, quite impressive, you've got to be proud of that. 
MATT KUCHAR:   It was nice to play a bogey‑free round today and finish with an up‑and‑down like that. 
I missed the fairway in the right rough and was counting on a little bit of a flier, I got just one of the biggest fliers I've had, in the back bunker, which I actually figured was an okay place to be.   But pinned up against the back wall was not great. 
Came through with a fantastic shot to four feet.   To make that putt and seal a round off with a 69 was a great way to finish the round.

Q.   You're six back of the leaders, you're 5‑under par, what kind of strategy do you have, what kind of expectation do you have heading into tomorrow?
MATT KUCHAR:   It's a long way back.   I think the guys will go out and continue playing some good golf.   There's a handful of holes where you can take advantage of them. 
These guys are playing great golf, Jordan and Martin, they're just on great form, so I expect them to increase their lead a little bit.   But I would like to still be within shouting distance, if I do something crazy tomorrow, it would be a lot of fun.

Q.   I want to go back to your last win, your last start, actually, at the RBC heritage, just spoke with your dad, that bunker shot that you made on the 72nd hole he said, in his life, he's never seen you show more emotion than you did after that shot.   Was it the highlight emotionally of your career?
MATT KUCHAR:   I think there's a lot of things that came out.   I had such close calls for three straight weeks, I had at least a share of the lead on Sunday for four straight weeks, and then to do what I did on 17, to 3‑putt from four feet and to come out and have a chance on 18 to do something with that bunker shot.   When I saw it go in, it was just a whole lot of relief, excitement, joy, just an overcome with a lot of things. 
I was pretty pumped up.   That was fun to see that go in.
