 Q.  Just spot on.  On a course like East Lake.  Happy with that, or do you feel like you could have gone lower?  
MATT KUCHAR: I mean, I could have.  I definitely missed a couple of opportunities out there, but shooting 66 around this golf course, as difficult as it is, it's never something I'm going to complain about.  But, yeah, that was the difference.  I actually hit my wedges around the hole today.   
A day like the first day, I hit a lot of fairways, but when I had wedges and irons in my hand, I was hitting it to 20 feet and not making those putts.  Today I hit a couple close ones and just gave myself a couple of great opportunities that I was able to convert.  That was the difference.   
 Q.  Talk about tomorrow.  A lot on the table for you personally.  Obviously, you can win here.  You're right there.  Ryder Cup still in the picture.  Talk about tomorrow.  I think it's a big day for you and you're playing great.  
MATT KUCHAR: My focus is 100 percent on this golf tournament and really trying to replicate what I did today.  Go out and play a really solid round of golf and keep myself into the mix in these last few holes.  A lot can happen on this golf course.  It can go both directions, and obviously got some great guys around me and ahead of me that have been playing some phenomenal golf, not just this year, but very recently.   
There's a lot out of my control.  I'm going to go try and do what I can tomorrow to shoot the best score I can and see where that lands me in the end.
