MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Oh, God, just had a great time out there.  It was so much fun, you know, to be playing golf, having a great time, playing a great guy.  Just had a great match today.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  He had beat my teammate to be, Bryce Molder, in the first round.  We talked a bit about that.  You know, it was just the regular chitchat going on:  Where you from?  How you doing?  Good shots.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  I'm way surprised.  Not in my dreams could I do this.


Q.  Why not? 

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  This is beyond my belief.  I met Johnny Miller this morning.  We had a good chat, and who else did I meet?  Dick Enberg and Roger Maltbie is out there.  It was almost like Tin Cup.  I felt I was out there.  So Roger Maltbie is talking about the lie and whatnot.  It was just pretty cool.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  I watched, you know, but when it's time to get focused, you know, I'm playing golf.


Q.  You're the only non-Walker Cupper in the semis.  Does that make things easier for you because no one expects you to be here?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  I just hope this adds brownie points to next year's Walker Cup.


Q.  But, I mean, do you feel like everybody is overlooking you?  Do you feel like anything you do now is gravy?  What do you feel?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Through the first year at Georgia Tech, I, you know, made a name for myself.  You know, I was freshman of the year for the ACC and made 13 All-American.  I won two tournaments, and people started to recognize me around.  So, you know, the other guys know me.  You know, we're all good friends.  I know all the four competitors, and so, you know, not being on the Walker Cup, the Walker Cup is just an extremely prestigious event.  Not to make it is not a huge downfall.  These other guys, they're great players, and they're great guys, too.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Not that well.  We played at the NCAA in the first round or two, and so I've gotten to know him through that.  He played great.  He was a good guy, too.


Q.  What was the key to coming back today?  I gather it took a while.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  You know, I remember, you know, I was two down after two holes.  That was kind of tough.  But with 16 holes, I really didn't think it was very much, you know.  And then all of a sudden on 3, I hit a great shot from the rough on 3, and I won with par.  But I never got too down, you know.  I never even got down at all.  Two down, I didn't think it was a big thing.  Just kept on playing.  I made a lot of  pars out there.  Pars are good out here.  Try to be on the fairway and the greens.  These greens got slick overnight.  It seems like they are extremely fast.  My lag putting was incredible today, I have to say.  Every hole I had a long putt, it was within 6 inches, I left it.


Q.  How have you done in match play before?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  I've played the U.S. Junior where I won one and then lost my second match.  And I was medalist at Rolex Junior Classic, and I lost first round.  And then I played in Cannon Cup and did well on Cannon Cup.  That's it.


Q.  What years were those, the U.S. Junior --

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Was Cannon Cup '94?  And I think it was the same year for U.S. Junior.  It was in Fargo, whatever year that was.


Q.  And the Rolex was when?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Rolex had to be '94.


Q.  So this is all pretty new to you as far as match play goes?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Yeah.  But we do it every Saturday morning at the club.  We go out and you play. That's how you play at the club.  You don't write down the strokes.  It's just hole by hole, so I've gotten used to it just banging around back home.  But this is so much more intense, you know. 18 holes is just, you know, still right now, I'm nervous.


Q.  Will you be nervous tomorrow when it's Saturday morning at the club again?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  No, not at the club, not at the club.  We've got some good guys back there.  A lot of good guys back home.  They're all rooting me on.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  You know, it's just a great experience to be here.  The expectations, you know, I was just so pleased to make it to match play.  And now, you know, to win four matches already is phenomenal to go on hopefully Sunday.  I'll be on ABC for the next -- for tomorrow, at least for tomorrow, and that's pretty --


Q.  NBC.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  That's what I said, NBC. And it will just be a lot of fun.  You know, I'm just out here just for experience.  I'm having a ball.


Q.  What's it like when you have a match where each hole seemed to be won by someone?  There wasn't a  lot of halved holes in your match.  Does that kind of keep you in the game a little bit more?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  They just told me about this when I came in.  They said I played 16 holes, and 14 were, you know, won or lost.  That's just an incredible stat, but I remember my coach telling me just to forget about match play and just go out there, keep your head down, play on, and they'll tell you when to stop.


Q.  You remembered that all the way through?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Yeah, it stuck in my head. So I wasn't paying too much attention to the holes that were won or lost.  I didn't know it was this back and forth all day.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Definitely.  Yeah, it's pretty hard not to keep track of that.  I remember the first couple matches, I was really trying to play like stroke play and couldn't do it.  I just was so into what the other guy was doing and trying to play it, you know, a match-play game, and, you know, I played some great matches against -- who did I play first round? Alan Zimmerman.  I was 4-under and won two and one. That was just a battle.  I got lucky.  The guy I played next.  Who did I play next?  James Young.  We each played poor.  Since I played poor, I was really lucky to come across a guy that was also struggling that day.  And John Rollins and I had a phenomenal match, and had a good match with Gerwin today.  It's been just a great experience.  Match play is -- it's unenjoyable to a point where you're so nervous, you're almost sick out there.  And, you know, you don't want to lose, and you're playing with good guys, and you hate to think that you're sending them home, but you don't want to go home either.


Q.  Was the third hole really critical today?  I mean, you hit a great second shot there, and you know, you lost the first two holes.  You lost to a birdie on one, which is all right, but you 3-putt two.  Now the nerves could kick in.  But come back with a great shot on 3.  Was that key?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  You know, I really think that was very key.  That shot, I mean, it looked like I was dead.  I was in the trees, in the rough, and, you know, just pulled that out of nowhere, and to win that hole after he got a good break off the tee, you know, hit it in the woods and kicked back in the fairway, and then I hit it deep left rough, and to win that hole was I thought, you know, a pretty big turning point because  I figured that he thought he was going three up after three, and that would be a pretty deep hole.


Q.  Where did you feel the match turned in the back 9?  The name of your coach?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Bruce Hepler from Georgia Tech.


Q.  Where do you feel the match turned on the back 9?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  It was tough to see that putt on -- what was it? -- 14 where Gerwin left, you know, like a 3- or 4-footer short.  I don't know what happened there.  It was like a decel or just a missed hit.  You know, I almost conceded the putt, but I just kept trickling backwards to a point where I felt might as well make it.  I think that hole was especially the turning point because I made a real good up-and-down, a great putt there, and then he missed a shorter one.


Q.  How long was your putt?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  My putt was about 5 feet. All right.  We'll go 7.


Q.  You're going to have to give more strokes next Saturday.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  They won't bet me.  They won't play with me anymore.  They'll just come and  watch, I guess.


Q.  Now, have you always lived in Florida?

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  Yeah, I'm from Orlando originally.  I guess I shouldn't have said they'll bet me.  That's pretty bad in the USGA.

MATTHEW KUCHAR:  She can delete it, can't she?
