Q.   How would you rate your performance today?
MATT KUCHAR:   Steady golf.   4‑under is a nice score.   Amazing what Tiger did out there.   It's just some incredible golf.   The rest of us‑‑ that 4‑under score is kind of a good barometer.   That's some good quality playing.   10‑under is an amazing round of golf.   I'd certainly take two more rounds of 4‑under par.

Q.   I'm sure you may have heard the roars or you may have been keeping up with what Tiger was doing, but when you see somebody going low on the golf course and in this case Tiger Woods, what does that do to your mindset as you continue on with your round or do you pay attention to it?
MATT KUCHAR:   You know, impressed by it.   It's only Friday.   There's not a whole lot of changes you're going to make on Friday.   I kind of felt sorry for Graeme McDowell.   I saw he posted a 5‑under par round, and it must have felt like it was 2‑ or 3‑over.   It's tough when you're paired with a guy like that.   It makes you feel like you're not doing much.   But the rest of us just go about our business.

Q.   This has been a firm and fast golf course the opening two rounds.   Good chance we're going to have some moisture tomorrow.   What is it going to do to Sherwood on Saturday if that rain happens? 
MATT KUCHAR:   I think it could change dramatically.   I think a place like this, some rain, I think significant rain could really soften things up and change this place.   The greens have been pretty firm, and I think a lot of rain will make the course play longer.   It may even be‑‑ it's not kind of cold, windy rain, if it's just a little bit of rain and softens things up, you may see some more low scores.
