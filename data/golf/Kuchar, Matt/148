 Q.  How did you find the golf course this afternoon compared to yesterday morning?  MATT KUCHAR: The golf course firmed up a lot, particularly late in the afternoon, handful of holes, hit a handful of short irons and couldn't keep them on the greens.  Kind of what you expect out of most U.S. Opens.  These afternoon rounds, they get firm and fast and tough to keep balls on the green.   Q.  I know it's impossible to predict, but it seems like we have a lot of people under par.  That's generally not what happens in a U.S. Open.  Is hanging around just the key for the next couple of days?  MATT KUCHAR: You're right.  I said even par after two rounds would be incredibly good, still awfully good.  Still a U.S. Open, still even par, in the Top 20, looking forward to a good weekend.  The course is playable.  I think they've done a good job.  It's getting firmer.  Afternoon rounds are much more difficult.  I think the USGA is doing an awfully nice job with the setup with the golf course.   Q.  Do you get more comfortable the more familiar you get or is it still the same?  MATT KUCHAR: It's still fun.  It's still unique.  Hideki and I missed the green just right.  We had great approach shots that looked like they were going to be close to the hole and trickled down the right.  He played first.  We were just a couple feet apart.  He played up a slope that was more pin high.  Got it back to about eight feet.  Played up a slope that was probably 40 feet away and came down to seven feet.  It was unique, all the different ways to play this golf course and play chip shots around the greens.
