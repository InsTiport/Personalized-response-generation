Q.   After a couple bogies earlier in your round, you're able to right the ship, Matt.   How did you bounce back from that slow start?
MATT KUCHAR:   I birdied the first.   I was off to it okay, and then fifth and sixth got me.   They were not very good bogeys, and to bounce back, played some nice golf coming in.   Drove the the ball well.   Made a few putts.   The greens were beautiful.   But scary as well.   They could get fast and get away from me.   I think if the wind picks up at all, these greens will really be tough.

Q.   We talked earlier in the week about this is your home course but you don't necessarily have the home‑course advantage because the conditions are a bit different from day‑to‑day play.   Is that the case?
MATT KUCHAR:   They keep the course in really good shape year around.   It's just when it firms up just a little bit and speeds up just a little bit, there are a couple of collection areas where I've learned now in some of the years past, 18's got middle of the green towards the right side there's a little collection area where I've found I've hit some good shots and the ball's just rolled down the hill and been a really tough up‑and‑down where I thought I had a good shot. 
And there are a couple other holes similar where if you just firm things up and speed things up, it's amazing how different a course can play.

Q.   And I know you have a lot of family and friends in town.   What's on tap for your early tee time on Friday?
MATT KUCHAR:   We've been pretty busy this week.   I'm looking forward to an easy night tonight.

Q.   Thanks, Matt.   We'll see you out there tomorrow. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Thanks.
