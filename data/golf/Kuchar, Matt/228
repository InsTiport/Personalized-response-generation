Q.   Obviously a long day, so you must be happy to, a, be finished and b, post 5‑under and have a great round?
MATT KUCHAR:   I played some great golf.   We get pretty used to delays like this.   Hanging out at Liberty National is not such a bad place to hang out.   It has got to be some of the best food of any clubhouse we go to all year, so it's pretty easy duty to hang out in this clubhouse and have some fun and socialize. 
You can get out of your rhythm but I think the guys out here pretty used to the delays and restarting.   It was nice for me to come out and shoot 5‑under, play some good, steady golf.   I felt like at PGA a couple weeks ago, I was on some pretty good form and glad to see it continue and hope it continues the rest of the week.

Q.   How did you manage your time when we were in both of those delays? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Oh, just socializing with people, hanging out.   There was a couple lunches eaten and a lot of socialization. 

Q.   How did you feel the course was playing today with the rain and after all the changes that have been made since the last time you guys were here?
MATT KUCHAR:   The course was great.   We had really good conditions.   Wind was pretty still most of the day.   And after the rain, it kind of softened things up.   Any time you get soft conditions, I think guys are going to go pretty low.   I think you'll see some good scores this afternoon.
