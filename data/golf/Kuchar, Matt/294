  MATT KUCHAR:   Thank you.   Really excited to have shot 4‑under today.   Breeze picked up on my final probably seven holes out there, and the course became difficult.   It was nice that I ended up birdieing No.6, 7 and 8 to make those three birdies.   7 played into the wind, 8 played into the wind.   Those were some tough holes, and to walk away 3‑under through that stretch was a great stretch.   I started off to a suspect start, drove it in the right woods on 10, made bogey; drove it in the right rough on 11, and from there played some really steady golf.  
   
 Q.   Going to be interesting with the wind picking up this afternoon?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I think if these conditions keep up, the course is difficult.   It was a challenge coming in today, and I think the guys are in for a tough course if this wind keeps up.  
   
 Q.   You've played 17 as your eighth hole.   Do you prefer it at that point in the round?   
MATT KUCHAR:   No, it would be a tough opening hole, but an eighth hole is well into the round.   You kind of know how you're playing.   17, again, you're well into your round.   Either way, it's okay.   
   
 Q.   Do you like it?   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I do.  
   
 Q.   Why?   
MATT KUCHAR:   I think it's a short, hard par‑3.   I think those are fun.   I think everybody enjoys playing those type of holes.
