 Q. 8-under par 63, just a tremendous start to the tournament?
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it's great being defending champion and coming out with a nice start, 8-under with some good playing. Played really well today and the conditions were there. I think there are going to be a lot of low scores over the next couple of days.

 Q. Talk about coming back this morning and what you did to finish up there?
 MATT KUCHAR: 17, made a par on 17. Just hit the fairway and hit the green, two putts. 
 18 is kind of a fun finishing hole, trying to drive the green on the last. I hit it right up on the green-side bunker and blasted out to 2 1/2 feet and tapped in for 8-under was a fun way to finish.
