MATT KUCHAR: From the conditions I felt like the first nine holes I took on and put off my rain gear probably at least nine times in nine holes.  It was interesting conditions.   
Just to kind of maintain, not have too many bad holes, to have a handful of good holes, 1-under par, I'm pleased with the start.   
 Q.  Four seasons in one day.  
MATT KUCHAR: That was it.  I went from hot and cold and wet and dry.  I had it all out there today.   
 Q.  Is it tough finishing late in the evening?  
MATT KUCHAR: It's a pleasant evening right now.  Got some friends at home meeting up for dinner, it will be an easy night.
