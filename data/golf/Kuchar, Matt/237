  MATT KUCHAR:   It was an amazing reception on the first tee, walking from the putting green to the first tee, there's a big gallery surrounding the first tee box and they give me a great reception and made me feel very welcome.   I was excited to get the round going.

Q.   Bubba Watson a few years ago had a hard time with the French fans, how different are they from those in the States?
MATT KUCHAR:   Not different, I think they very much appreciate the golf and they certainly treated me well.

Q.   How do you rate your chances here?
MATT KUCHAR:   The golf course suits me really well.   I really enjoy it.   It's a difficult‑driving golf course and I feel that I'm a good driver of the golf ball.   Played from the fairway a lot today, which you've got to if you're trying to make birdies and trying to score well. 
Fortunately drove it well.   Didn't have the greatest distance control with irons and with the putter, as well, but still managed around a 1‑under par.   I think it's a good start.

Q.   Looks pretty much like a links golf course.   Do you think it's a good prep for the British Open?
MATT KUCHAR:   I do.   It's firm and fast.   You don't really run many balls up on the greens.   A lot of the greens are perched up high so you have to fly them on the green.   Other than that, it has a very good links feel.
