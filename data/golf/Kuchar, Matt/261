Q.   Nice way to close out there, two birdies the last three holes on another good week in Hawai'i. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, it was another good week.   I was so excited after Friday's round to be in contention and really bummed to not do any better Saturday.   I felt like this course sets up well for me.   I felt like I was playing some good golf, and shooting even par yesterday was frustrating, but nice to come back with 5‑under today, close with two birdies on the last three.   Still a good week.   Really enjoyed my time here in Hawai'i.

Q.   You've really embraced these two tournaments.   Talk about a little bit from the players' standpoint what it means to play over here for a couple weeks. 
MATT KUCHAR:   It's such a treat to qualify for Hyundai and for the Tournament of Champions.   It's a small, elite field, great guys, and they take such good care of you.   Getting to start your year off in Maui is just a real treat, and then coming here to one of my favorite courses of the year, it's just a fantastic couple weeks.   You enjoy some sunshine, some good weather, and it's a great way to start the year.

Q.   Only player with top 10s both weeks.   Talk a little bit about how that sets you up for the early part of the year. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, the game is good.   I like to try to come out ready to go.   It's kind of a hard juggling act to get yourself a proper off‑season and still be ready to go come first week of January.   But put some good work in in Palm Springs, hoping to play well again next week.   I'm playing the Humana Challenge, so hoping to keep it going.   But certainly a nice way to start.

Q.   Only negative for you this week is there's a bulldog up at the top of the leaderboard. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, he's playing good.   I'm pretty excited for him.   First pro PGA event, it's pretty cool to see him doing so well.
