Q.   Can you just comment on the round for us today? 
MATT KUCHAR:   I got off to a great start, was really playing good.   Looking back I hit two amazing shots into number 9.   Ball was up on the green and rolled back down.   Making a bogey, it turned a birdie into a bogey.   Man, looking back, that was a real bummer. 
But steady golf, not really in trouble.   Was able to convert on a lot of my opportunities, so it was a good day.   Nice to bounce back from yesterday.   Yesterday was a frustrating day for me on the golf course.   Today to come back and kind of see my name come up on the leaderboard was nice to see.

Q.   That's what I was going to ask about bouncing back.   It felt good to do that? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, two rounds of 5‑under par, and then I felt like I played decent golf yesterday on this course.   You get on the wrong side of things and missed a couple putts which happened, and all of a sudden I was 2‑over par.   It was nice to bounce back.

Q.   And nice for going into next week too?
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I got good momentum going next week.   I really enjoy Waialae.   I think it's a great golf course and one of my favorites all year on TOUR.   It's one I look forward to going into and looking forward to going into next week.
