 Q.   World Golf Championship, tongue and cheek, the 12‑year‑old made nine birdies on you.   How do you react to someone just playing that well?   
MATT KUCHAR:   He played great.   I knew I was in for a tough match.   Jordan has been playing some great golf.   He plays well every week.   I knew he was just demolishing guys.   I guess I'm pretty glad to take him to 17.   
It's a bummer always looking back on things.   I missed a 3‑footer on 10, pretty uncharacteristic.   Then chances there at the end.   It was a fun match.   Not a whole lot of fun sitting there on 17 when a guy has got a chance to knock you out.   
But to lose to a guy that's playing that good, I can only sit back and cheer him on to go win the whole thing.
