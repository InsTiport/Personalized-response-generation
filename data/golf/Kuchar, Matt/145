 Q.  Talk a little about last week?  MATT KUCHAR: It was a fun week last week.  St. Andrews is cool.   Q.  Long week?  MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, that's for sure.   Q.  How was your round there today?  MATT KUCHAR: Today's round was good.  I drove it really well.  This course is in fantastic shape.  Best shape I've seen.  Always good with the firm conditions being in the fairway.  If you're in the rough, you're going to have trouble getting the ball to stay on the green.  So I found myself with a lot of fairways and a lot of chances of trying to make some birdies. Did well on the front.  Couple stumbles on the back which was a bit disappointing.  But all in all, 3-under is a good way to start the week.   Q.  Lot of players seem to be giving themselves a lot of chances.  Are the greens tough out there to play?  MATT KUCHAR: Not tough.  They're in great shape, fun to play.  Really, real good golf.   Q.  Is this the firmest you've seen this course play?  MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, and the few times I've been here, definitely the firmest I've seen it play.  The greens staff should be pretty pleased with what they've done with this place.
