Q.   That was the essence of match play, wasn't it?   You fall behind, you battle back and you get an unexpected win, here.   You just battled all the way, didn't you, Matt?
MATT KUCHAR:   That's exactly how I felt.   I played good, steady golf the front nine.   Played 1‑under.   And I was 2 down going into ten.   And then Lance got the jockey whip out and started riding.   And I started playing some really good golf.   And I played some really solid golf.   I think I had a stretch of three holes, 4‑under par, birdies at 10 and 11 and chip in for eagle on 12.   And then Stephen gave me 14 and 16, a couple of mistakes.
So kind of got lucky to get by, because we were both playing really good golf through 13 holes. 

Q.   Of course, if you go down 0 and 2 in this competition, there would be no way you could reach Saturday.   As it is, you need to win on Friday and see what happens. 
MATT KUCHAR:   That's right.   That's right.   I haven't seen what Hunter and‑‑

Q.   Hunter won. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Hunter won? 

Q.   Yes. 
MATT KUCHAR:   So I've got a chance tomorrow.   If I play Hunter and I can beat Hunter, then there could be a playoff or I could just win, if Stephen wins.

Q.   That's right. 
MATT KUCHAR:   It is crazy.   Crazy what this format is. 
If I could have asked for things to work out after I lost the first round, this would be the way I'd hope the draw would have fallen.
