Q. Just talk about your game a little bit.
MATT KUCHAR: It was challenging.  It was funny, there was some clown last night asking me what -- what the score should be to win, and I said, your guess is as good as mine.  Yeah, I think trying to put a number on something today, I go out and I shoot 2 under par, I win.  You're thinking yesterday I need to shoot 6 under maybe to win.
I came out on the front nine, I played great, great golf.  I mean, really, really was in full control.  And then a couple less than great shots.  I had a great chance on 11, I think, to go to 17 under.  Not an easy putt, but certainly a great chance.
12 was really hard today, walked away with bogey today.  I hit a lousy approach.
It wasn't the worst thing, but then to come out and double, I hit a tee shot in the bunker, which was a tough place to be.  To come out after the break and turn that into a double was really disheartening.  Kind of tough to come back.  Conditions played really hard when I came back out.
The other real mistake, I hit two really quality shots on 15, and then guessing on the wind was so strong.  Hit a gap wedge through -- we were thinking between gap wedge and pitching wedge, and I completely misjudged the wind, hit it over.  It was just a place you can't go.
It was a little bit tough seeing Will hit in front of me, having the ball back up and nearly go off the green and thinking I need to be a little more aggressive.  It was clearly the wrong play, and I was lucky to have a bogey there.
Last three holes, I played beautifully.  I had kind of -- I hit great shots on the last three holes.  It was fun to think for a second maybe I still have a chance.
Q. The delay came with you in the bunker on 13.  Is that tough timing?
MATT KUCHAR: Well, it's certainly not a prime spot to be with or without a delay.  I was in a tough situation, and I turned it into a really bad situation there with what I did after the delay.  Certainly, I don't blame that on the delay.  It was tough before or after the delay.
Q. You've had such success here.  Were you feeling it when you got to 16 under?
MATT KUCHAR: On the front nine, I was just in such control.  I thought it was really my day.  I think on the 5th hole I hit one of my best 5 irons of the week just right over the pin, had a good look at eagle and thought that was a perfect shot.  I was in great control.
I actually made bogey on the next and kind of misjudged the wind.  I thought it was switching to be into us, and it was still pretty hard left to right and made bogey.
But I still felt like I was going to make a lot more birdies and really put my name on the trophy again this year.
Q. So what's your takeaway from the week?  Right there, disappointed finish, to come away feeling all right about the weekend?
MATT KUCHAR: Certainly pleased in the way I played the final three holes.  Very disappointed too.  I can't remember what I shot on the back nine, maybe 3 over on the back nine.  Very disappointed.  But that was a matter of two bad shots really, and those things happen in the game.  I mean, it could have been two bad shots on Thursday.
When I look back at certainly another nice finish, at some point, the nice finishes don't mean too much.  You really look to put your name inside the clubhouse on the winners trophy.  And that's where I feel like I stand right now with my game, it's nice to finish fourth place, but that's not what I showed up here to do.
Q. What happened on the bunker shot at 13?
MATT KUCHAR: It's a big lip.  I caught it thin.  I was trying to really hoist it high, then tried to help it up, and never a smart thing to do.  I hit it thin and hit it into the wall of the bunker.
Q. When you have such conditions, how difficult is it to gauge shot selection with the wind?
MATT KUCHAR: Certainly very hard.  I got lucky on 16 that Gary was kind of the guinea pig.  He hit 8 iron over the green, and I thought it was a perfect 7 iron for me from there.  It was an easy decision to pull 8.
I made a mess of the hole before, 15, having just a wedge in my hand.  It was blowing so hard that 96 yards, I thought was playing close to 115.  I thought there was enough wind, and I completely kind of miscalculated it from the low spot, hitting a low wedge, was just a bad calculation.
