  Q. The morning match didn't go your way, but what does it feel to come back out here and win the consolation match in the afternoon?
 MATT KUCHAR:   So what time's my next match?  When do I get Billy Horschel.  I got six points, how many has he got?  Come on, Billy, any time, any place, I'm ready, you know it.
 This is, this is as good as I felt about my game I had a blast out here.  Austin Country Club was just magnificent, the setup was fun, they did a great job, every year we come here I really enjoy myself, I enjoy the format.  Certainly it was anti-climatic playing in the afternoon match, but once you get out, once you get going, the juices get going and you don't want to lose.  So it was a good battle with Victor in the end, but it's a tough match to be a part of.
 Q. As you said, maybe a little anti-climatic, but a lot of momentum can be taken, not just from this week but from this match.  What does this do for you as you move forward?
 MATT KUCHAR:   I'm so much more excited about my game that be than I've within earlier this year.  This year's been a struggle, but thankfully things have turned a corner, put in some good work with Chris O'Connell, really starting to feel good about my game.  There's never a bad time to kind of be off, you would like to be on all the time, and I've been fortunate over the past several years to have a lot of on times, but certainly with the upcoming events it's a good time to kind of have the game clicking a little bit better again.
 Q. Do you feel like that on time is coming back to your game now?
 MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, yeah, certainly I'm as pleased as I've been in a long time.  I feel like I kind of can step up and know where the ball's going again.  My misses aren't near as bad as they were the last few months and when your misses are in play, you got a chance to shoot some decent scores.
