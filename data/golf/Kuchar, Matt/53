 Q.  Well Kuch, talk about today.  What a good day.  Only missed two fairways, and that was just barely missing it.  Only three greens.  
MATT KUCHAR: Certainly that's the key around here.  If you drive it well you can play well.  This course is tricky, it's tight, there are a lot of doglegs.  Finding fairways are a tough thing to do and I drove it really well.   
Take that me to score a good number today.   
 Q.  Stress-free.  13 you hit in that bunker.  I know you were disappointed with your approach, but you got up and down.  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, that was probably my one stressful hole.  It's a very tough hole.  Good drive and 5-iron in; just pulled it a bit.  Got an easy up and down and was glad to make a six-footer for par and keep the scorecard clean after that.   
 Q.  Your first six or seven years here you didn't play this course particularly well.  The last few years you've been great.  What is it?  Just learning the golf course?  Getting more comfortable?  
MATT KUCHAR: I think my game has improved as well.  I definitely think I understand my game better.  I financial like I've just evolved into a better player.  Certainly this course is unique.  We don't play many like it.  Reminds me a little bit of Hilton Head, a little bit of Colonial.  It's tight, it's narrow, it's flat, but, man, it's tricky.   
 Q.  Excited about tomorrow?  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, yeah.  I feel good about my game.  I love coming here many.  I love the state of Hawaii.  I love playing golf here.  It's a treat, and this is certainly a fun place to be.
