Q. How pleasing was it to see that eagle on 18 and card a 68?
MATT KUCHAR: Nice to see that ball trickle off that back slope on 18, right about six feet, and I knew I stood a pretty good chance of making that one.  To end your day on an eagle, doesn't happen often, and it's always a joyous occasion when it does.
Q. Your round started a little bit up-and-down, didn't it, but you steadied things down and it was a fantastic back nine.
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, pretty strange for me, a birdie, bogey, bogey, birdie start was not all that I expected.
Right now, you can take advantage, particularly with the wind blowing the way it was today, the direction.  The par 5s were reachable, and a couple short-ish par 4s.  It was nice to come home on a good number.
Q. How nice is it for you to be back here playing links golf in Scotland?
MATT KUCHAR: I always enjoy it.  I have a lot of fun playing golf here.  It's different than what we play back home, but I find it fun, and you have to be so creative here.  It makes the game of golf very enjoyable.
Q. Does this week before The Open take more significance in coming back and playing a links golf course knowing you've got Birkdale to come next week?
MATT KUCHAR: I think it's great what they are doing, taking The Scottish Open to links golf.  To me it's like Wimbledon, guys go play Queens before Wimbledon; they want to play a similar surface.
I think this has been great to come and get a links tune-up.
