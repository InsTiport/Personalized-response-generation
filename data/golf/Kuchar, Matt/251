 Q.   If you could just talk a little about your round today?   
MATT KUCHAR:   Nice to get off to a good start with a birdie on 10 and then again a birdie on 12, so really I had some good things going.   I was thinking after parring 11, it felt similar to yesterday.   I hit a couple of good shots and yesterday I was on the green in two, and I had no chance of two‑putting from the place I was today.   Good position in two and failed the up‑and‑down, so kind of a bummer.   
But I felt like the game is in good shape.   Yesterday I felt like I played good golf, and wasn't able to take advantage of some good shots I had.   Today those opportunities came back, and I was able to take advantage and really feel good about my game, my position and looking forward to the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Can you be aggressive on all the par‑5s in these kind of conditions?   It seems just watching you today on 2 just firing it up there and got the birdie.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I feel like I pull driver on more holes than most guys out here.   I feel like my driver is a strength of mine, and a couple of these shorter holes where guys are laying back with irons or hybrids, I pull driver a lot.   I feel if the short iron is in my hand, I can take advantage.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever played here before with Tiger?   
MATT KUCHAR:   Before what?   
   
 Q.   With Tiger.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I played, but he withdrew one of the days.   I can't remember.  
   
 Q.   '10 or '11?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I remember, and after I guess it was 27, he withdrew.  
   
 Q.   He seems to have taken a different approach this year, talking about drivers, he hit three today.   Do you notice that at all about laying back and not being as aggressive?   
MATT KUCHAR:   His 5‑wood and 3‑wood are probably as long as my driver, so it doesn't seem to be a big need for him.   If I was in that good of control of a driver and 3‑wood, like he is, I don't think it's necessary at all.  
   
 Q.   Past champions really seem to be having a great start, yourself, Tiger, Sergio, Adam certainly other guys could get going today.   In your opinion, is it because of the conditions why do you think guys that have won this event seem to really be playing well these first two days?   
MATT KUCHAR:   This is the thing where you've just got to be playing good golf, whether it's past champions or not.   Course knowledge only helps when you're playing good golf.   Take Rory McIlroy who has played terrible golf around here or not made a cut, but he's not playing good golf when he's shown up here.   You've got to be playing good golf.   He's playing good golf right now, and I expect good things.   
I think past champions always have a good feeling around a course they've won on, and that certainly helps out.  
   
 Q.   There was a run of guys winning multiple championships here, and then there's been a big streak where it's all been first‑time guys for the last nine years.   Do you get a sense that it's due for somebody to win a multiple players here?   
MATT KUCHAR:   You think so.   Guys that win here are great players, so you kind of expect those guys to win again.   But the PGA TOUR is deep.   There are a lot of good players.  
   
 Q.   Can you compare the conditions from yesterday afternoon?   It seemed like the wind came up a little bit as opposed to this morning.   Was there any difference?   
MATT KUCHAR:   Not much.   I always make notes.   I try to make a note of the strength and the direction that it's coming on approach shots.   I didn't notice a big difference from yesterday to today.  
   
 Q.   From a scorable standpoint, it's been about even?   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I would say the only differences are the conditions of the greens in the morning are a lot nicer than they are in the afternoons.   So that would be the advantage.
