Q.   Talk about going into the final round of THE PLAYERS. 
MATT KUCHAR:   It was exciting, a lot of birdies and a lot more bogeys than I normally make.   But I knew today was going to be a tricky day.   I knew there were going to be a lot of bogeys.   I knew there were dangers around every corner. 
It was nice, I felt like every time I made a bogey, I bounced back with a birdie.   It seemed to be a great day as far as not letting the bad holes bother me.   I think that's one of my strong suits; today it came in really helpful.

Q.   After conditions changed during the round, did you have to adjust?   Wind looked like it kicked up in the middle. 
MATT KUCHAR:   It kicked up in the middle but died down a little late there.   I was pretty excited to see the wind die down.   Unfortunately didn't help me much; on 17 I found the water and played the last three 1‑under.   Those are three holes you never know but hope to make a birdie on 16, and then survive 17 and 18.

Q.   You made the turn, hit the longest drive of the day, maybe longest drive ever on 10.   
MATT KUCHAR:   That's not like me.   I cut the corner and just rolled‑‑ it was a hot ball.   It rolled through the fairway and into the rough.   Rough is not fun to be in.   Hit a great shot short of the green and hit it to 20 feet and to make that, was an excellent birdie. 

Q.   Mentally, you were kind of grinding away. 
MATT KUCHAR:   At that point it was three in a row on 10.   I had some good things going and bogeyed 11, the par5.   I didn't play that well on the back side.   I bogeyed 11 and parred 16.   But after the bogey on 11 bounced back with a birdie on 12 and 13 and bogeyed 14 and birdied 15.   It seemed like it was a lot of back and forth.   It's one of those things, you're going to have those holes, and I was real glad that I was hanging tough and able to bounce back with some good holes.
