 Q.   Talk about your round today, how you felt like you did.   
MATT KUCHAR:   I felt like I played great golf, felt like I really drove it well.   That's key around here.   
I was in a lot of fairways, but even from the fairways if you're not hitting good shots you're struggling.   You got to be really precise with the irons with as firm as these greens are and I felt like I had a lot of birdie opportunities and wasn't scrambling too much, which is strange around here.   
I felt like I was really playing some good golf and even par's a nice score.   
   
 Q.   So there's obviously a difference in the morning and afternoon round or whatever, do you think that score for an afternoon round like this is particularly better?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I don't know, the conditions, the wind didn't pick up like it can in the afternoon, it seemed to stay pretty steady.   
So I don't know if it would have been any better in the morning.   It was just a nice solid round of golf.   Around here morning it can be so cold that I think it can be even just as hard.
