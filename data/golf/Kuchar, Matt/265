 Q.   A great 64 today, you play a lot of events, is that an advantage when you come into a day like this, not really panicking, knowing a little bit better where your game is at?  
MATT KUCHAR:   42 more to go, right?  
(Laughter.)  
It certainly helps.   Playing the last couple weeks, I know my first week out at the Tournament of Champions there was definitely some rust and lack of scoring.   And coming out that first week, even if you have been practicing, which I was, tournament play is just a little bit different.  
So I've had two weeks of tournament play right off the bat and that's great.  
   
 Q.   How much more do you get out of your round when you aren't playing in 42 mile an hour winds?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I always try to come out to Palm Springs before the year starts.   You can count on the weather and it's a good way to really test your game.  
In the wind that you get, at Kapalua, you hit a lot of punch shots and a lot of three quarter shots and you're not making full, proper golf shots.   So you come out here, you got perfect conditions, you can just really try and attack some pins, and this is a real good judge of how your game is stacking up.  
   
 Q.   Last year was a great step in your progression as a player, do you have a Major circled on your calendar this year?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Definitely trying for a Major.   Hoping for a multiple win season.   I've not had one.   Those are a couple goals out there that I've set.  
East Lake in Atlanta is one of my home courses, so I'm hoping to have a really good year.
