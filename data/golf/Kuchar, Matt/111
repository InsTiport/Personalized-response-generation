 Q. It's kind of been hypothetical, Gold Medal and all that, but tomorrow it's for real. Is there a little different feeling now that we're this deep in the tournament?   
MATT KUCHAR: The tournaments always get more exciting Sunday afternoon. I'm a bit out of it, but certainly not all the way out. So I've got a shot, and that makes golf on Sunday exciting. It's kind of having a chance to win a tournament, and here, win a medal. I'm sure excited to get tomorrow going.  
   
 Q. Third place is a big deal this week. Will you be looking differently at the back nine?  
MATT KUCHAR: Absolutely. There's no protecting Top‑10, no protecting a Top‑5. You've got to strive to be on the podium, strive to win the Gold Medal, and hope that if it's not gold, it's silver; and if it's not silver, it's bronze.   
   
 Q. What have you seen out there, when you look at the crowds? Is it more or less or anything different than what you would expect?  
MATT KUCHAR: Way more. I thought all of the events in the Olympics, particularly in Brazil, that it may not be much of a showing of interest‑‑ sorry, not interest, but just a whole lot of fans making their way out to golf. But I've been more than surprised, more than impressed by the showing here of support and fans coming out to watch golf.  
   
 Q. What's it feel like as an Olympic sport as a player? I don't know what I mean by it either. Golf is part of the broader Olympics, trying to distinguish between the two. You guys are one of 28 sports now instead of being the big dogs in town instead of when you go to Augusta or when you go to Seattle for the U.S. Open or something like that; and now you're just alongside swimmers that everyone is paying attention to and whatnot.   
MATT KUCHAR: I think and I hope there's a great deal of interest. I guess it's yet to be seen until this thing is wrapped up how it's looked at. But from fan support from other athletes that I've run across, everybody is kind of excited that we're here.   
I think it's awesome. I think the further golf goes in the Olympics, the more times it's played, I think the more support it will get and the more excitement guys will have. I think the opportunity to play for your country, whether it's a team of two, a team of four, whatever you can do, this has been just such a great experience and it's just going to continue to grow and grow and grow.  
   
 Q. Is the course firming up at all?   
MATT KUCHAR: I think it's all been firm. It's a new course, and so new courses typically tend to start out firm. I don't remember it being soft ever.   
   
 Q. There were some mud balls in the practice rounds.   
MATT KUCHAR: When we got some rain. We certainly had a bit a handful of nights. But the course is in great shape.   
   
 Q. Would you guess what a winning score would be tomorrow?  
MATT KUCHAR: Certainly the wind is going to make a huge factor. Rickie Fowler went out early and was 6‑under through the front nine, and then I think the wind started picking up and got a little more challenging. Low scores are doable. We saw the 8‑under the first day and Rickie 7‑under today. Wind will play a big part tomorrow.  
   
 Q. Are you guys allowed to flush paper down the toilets at the Olympic Village?   
MATT KUCHAR: I've not been there. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Are we allowed to? I don't know if we're allowed to or not. I'm not sure what the rules are.
