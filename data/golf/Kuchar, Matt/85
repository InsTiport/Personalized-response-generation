MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I was looking forward to tougher conditions knowing that I'd have a chance to make up a lot of ground.  I felt like I've been hitting the ball well, and when you're hitting it well, the wind doesn't affect it quite as much.  So I thought I stood a chance to gain some ground with a good round, and I think I did just that.   
 Q.  Front nine was pretty steady for you, then the back nine, picking up four birdies.  What changed between the front and back?  
MATT KUCHAR: I played good golf the entire day.  It was all pretty good.  I finally got ahold of No. 10.  No. 10 has been a nemesis for me, and to sneak away with birdie there was a huge relief to get through that hole.  And just kept plodding along with some good golf.  I had a good chip-in on 12 and nice birdie to close on 18.   
 Q.  Overall, how would you assess your championship play and your time here at Erin Hills this week?  
MATT KUCHAR: I really enjoyed my time here.  It was a fun week.  I thought the golf course was great.  I thought the people were great.  I think the tournament was really well run.  It was certainly -- we'll be leaving on a high note.   
 Q.  Was today more of a U.S. Open-quality test maybe with scoring conditions being a little easier the first three days?  
MATT KUCHAR: Certainly harder with the greens being so receptive after the rain we had, and not quite your typical U.S. Open Sunday test.  But with the winds the way they were, it was not an easy round of golf by any means.
