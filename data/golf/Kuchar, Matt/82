Q. Matt Kuchar, you played this event ten times and you've made the cut all ten times.  What is it about this tournament that you like?
MATT KUCHAR: I very much enjoy coming here.  Probably the No. 1 draw is my coach Chris O'Connell is in Plano, get some extra time with him.
The place, the whole environment.  I love staying at the Four Seasons, have the sports club, get some fitness in.  My kids are growing up.  We got in the fitness club, played some squash this morning, had just a good time.  I've enjoyed the course but I love the hospitality here.
Q. Speaking of the hospitality, what about the fans, you can hear the kids behind us saying, "Kuch".  I heard it on the course.  Is it fun to play in an environment like that?
MATT KUCHAR: It's an amazing environment here.  They get such good fan support here.  It's really fun.  Feels like a great backyard party.  Everybody is here having a good time, enjoying the golf and it's really a great environment.
Q. Your 6-under total right now so you're hovering around 215, 213 right now.  What do you think it's going to take for you tomorrow to stay in that spot?
MATT KUCHAR: Hopefully to do better than stay in that spot.  I'd like to move up.  I played nice golf today.  It's been a good week and I'm hoping to keep goods things going.  I've been work withing Chris this week and put some good work in and feel like the game is coming around and starting to play really well.
Q. Thank you for your time and good luck tomorrow.
MATT KUCHAR: Thank you.
