  Q. Well, I guess it's just the same old thing with you. You just get on the golf course and have a good round, another 65 out there.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Another year, keep on going. I had a nice off-season, took a lot of time off and wasn't really sure how things would come off, but last year was such an amazing year. Nice to see that 2011 is starting off pretty well again.  
  
  Q. Do you feel that way on the golf course again, 2011, you go, okay, it's the same old thing?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Same old thing. It's been going really well, and I'm real happy to see that things are continuing to go well. Golf is a fickle game, I know that, and I certainly appreciate being able to play some good golf, and I hope to continue it.  
  
  Q. And it's cool, your caddie walks off the golf course, turns on his cell phone and there's a video of his baby girl taking her first steps.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Life is good. We're here in Hawai'i, the sun is shining, a beautiful day, and my man has got his little girl taking some steps. It's a good day.  
  
  Q. Now, tell me about your game. What are you happiest with? Is there anything you feel like you need to work on?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Could be a little steadier I think on the greens. I feel like I'm putting well, but I'm used to putting really well, so I'd like to find that touch again. Some of my wedges are a little rusty. I haven't gotten the wedges dialed in just yet.
