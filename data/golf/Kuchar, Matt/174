Q.   Matt, nice finish for you with a chipâ€‘in birdie on the last? 
MATT KUCHAR:   It was an awesome way to finish.   I felt like I got robbed on 17.   I hit an incredible putt that I was sure was going to go in and it teased me as it rimmed around the role and just stopped outside. 
I hit I thought two really good shots into the hole, got a bit unlucky that the ball came up just short and trickled down the hill, and what a spectacular finish, to see it go in and see the crowd go crazy was fun and nice way to bump up that leaderboard a bit. 
18 has been awfully good to me.   I really enjoy Ridgewood.   I think it's one of the best courses we play any year and fun for me to come back, put on another good show.   This is a special place for me. 

Q.   New York is a fun place to be, isn't it? 
MATT KUCHAR:   It sure it.   The greater New York area, the crowds come out and they are exciting and they are into it, and they had great weather.   It was a fun atmosphere out there.
