 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
MATT KUCHAR: I think the PGA does a fantastic job of setting it up.  I think you can tell a lot by a golf course by its leaderboard come Sunday, and you've got one of the great leaderboards with Jason Day and Jordan Spieth.  Just guys that are playing the best golf in the world are on top of the leaderboard.   
It was playable.  If you were playing good, you could make birdies.  If you weren't, you were making bogeys.  So I've enjoyed it.  I had a couple good weeks here.  I think my two PGAs have been successful tournaments for me.   
 Q.  I notice you down there on 12 and 13, you were checking out the jet skis in the water of Lake Michigan, almost like you wanted to hop down there and jump on?  
MATT KUCHAR: I was happy being inside the ropes doing what I was doing, but a close second would have been down there on the jet skis, that looked like a good time.   
 Q.  Feel good heading into the playoffs?  
MATT KUCHAR: The game's really good, I feel like, all parts.  I'm doing a lot of good things.  I got a good session in this week, Chris O'Connell came into town and just made a slight tweak that really improved my ball striking and I had a nice week hitting the ball around this place.
