 Q. Talk about your round today in these conditions to be where you are, you have to feel pretty good. 
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I played really well for two days. This probably has to be one of the hardest courses on TOUR, and throw in a 20- to 30-mile-an-hour wind, it becomes really hard.

 Q. When you see Rory Sabbatini shoot 6-under in these conditions, what do you think when you see that?
 MATT KUCHAR: It's impressive. Somebody is always going to do it. I don't think there's a round of golf where somebody doesn't shoot a pretty good score, but he's probably going to be one of the few. I think if you keep it anywhere around par, you're doing well.

 Q. What's your game plan for the weekend? 
 MATT KUCHAR: I don't come out with a game plan. 

 Q. Guys were referring to the conditions and this course like U.S. Open conditions, how important is it for you guys to get to play courses like this leading up to the majors to get you ready for what you're going to see there?
 MATT KUCHAR: Guys prepare all sorts of different ways. You don't see Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson here, but I think any time you can play a difficult course, it helps.
