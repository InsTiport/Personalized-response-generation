  Q. What did you see playing with Colin Montgomerie?  
 MATT KUCHAR: His game is not the sharpest. He started out nicely. Seems like his game is not the sharpest. I'm sure that has to do with a lot being on his mind. I reckon it's hard to play golf and then do all of the other activities that they require.  
  
  Q. What did the extra time on the range allow you to do?   
 MATT KUCHAR: Just find my swing again. I'm not a big fan of less than eight hours' sleep; it was 5 1/2 hours' sleep last night. I never wake up in the best of spirits. So it was just some extra time to kind of get my body back in sync again.  
  
  Q. You're actually in a bad mood sometimes?  
 MATT KUCHAR: No, I just don't feel great when I wake up on five hours sleep. My body just feels funny.  
  
  Q. You played really well today and leading the tournament, when you saw --  
 MATT KUCHAR: Maybe if it was Corey Pavin, I would have wanted to pass in front of him. Not as many when it came to Colin. He was quite friendly and easy to talk to and easy to play with.  
  
  Q. Because you're playing so well, does it feel good to turn right around and go back out and play?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Absolutely.  
 I would like to end this shortly.
