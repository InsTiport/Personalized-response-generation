Q.   Whether you were standing over that putt, that's the first time you've played 18 all week, how tough was that match? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Really tough match.   This guy is a horse, Holy Cow.   He played some incredible golf today.   I was along for the ride for most of it.   Let him down a couple times, missed a few putts, but boy, that sure was a fun way to end it.

Q.   You told us Thursday you were ham‑and‑egging it, what did you do this time? 
TIGER WOODS:   Same thing.   It was one of those matches where we were down two early and could have got up on that front nine, could have gone 1‑up and all of a sudden we are down again.   Then we made a little bit of a run and then Hideki made a bomb on 16 and just made it a little bit more interesting coming down the last couple holes. 
But Kuch, man, what a birdie on 18.
