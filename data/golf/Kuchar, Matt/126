Q. Do you feel like you stole one? 
MATT KUCHAR: I played some amazing golf. I felt really, really good out there. I hit it beautifully. I even putted well. I tell you, I putted well and I had three three‑putts on the front nine, and still came off the golf course feeling like that. I putted very well. It is a challenge. The course is playing as hard as I remember it playing.

Q. How much was it affecting the greens with the wind?
MATT KUCHAR: These greens, as fast as they are, and some of the pin placements, every three footer is a real challenge. It can get away from you and you could end up with ten feet coming back. 
So it's a nerve‑wracking proposition, and I'm certainly glad to be done even par and now I can put my feet up and watch it.

Q. The last hole?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I drove it in the fairway, still had adjusted 200 yards to the hole. But it's not easy with the wind blowing hard left‑to‑right. You know you can't miss the green to the left. You've got no chance of getting up and down. And missed the bunker, had about a 10‑footer left for par. And to see that go in certainly has me finish on a good note and feeling good about the round and going into tomorrow, as well. 

Q. You're 4‑over, but you could still be in the ballgame by the end of the day. Is that kind of the mindset you take?
MATT KUCHAR: We'll see what happens this afternoon. But I certainly helped myself today by shooting even par. And I know that I'll be a ways back, but at least if there's some sort of spectacular round I may have a chance tomorrow.
