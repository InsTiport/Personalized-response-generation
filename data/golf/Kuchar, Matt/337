 Q. Convincing win today. Well done. Just a couple of highlights about the match. 
 MATT KUCHAR: Played a lot better today. Yesterday was an ugly match, but I squeaked through. Today was a lot cleaner golf. Things went my way and I was able to win. I feel like my game is getting better and better.

 Q. What do you think the difference is between yesterday? Good bounces? Bad bounces? Your game is getting better?
 MATT KUCHAR: I did not hit it very well yesterday, particularly with the driver. Drove it better. I was struggling, seemed like, every hole. My tee shots were in trouble and I was scrambling. Today was a lot cleaner.

 Q. Any stand-out shots or holes from today's match that you're particularly proud of?
 MATT KUCHAR: No, no, it was just -- nothing fancy, nothing crazy happened. There was no kind of reversal of fortune out there. It was just golf today.
