Q. A few comments on how that match went today?
MATT KUCHAR: I got off to a really bad start. Slow start, I guess I should say. I think it I was 3-down through three. Been in plenty of matches and played plenty of golf before and know the tides can turn. I had played some good golf this week and was sure I was going to keep it going. I was sure I could turn it around if I just kind of forgot about those first few holes, forgot about the score, just kept playing golf and was able to make some birdies in the middle of the round.
So nice to make some birdies, get it back into a match, and then to make that birdie on 17, knowing what it meant. Just couldn't be more excited. That was such an emotional moment for me, to make that putt and to see all the team there and to know exactly what that putt meant, it was just awesome.
Q. What does it say about the resolve of this team to come from 2-down going into today?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, yeah, it's a strong bunch of guys. This team on paper is great, but then in the team room, it's awesome, knowing that even in a deficit, these guys are going to come out and play and going to be really hard to beat. They sure were.
