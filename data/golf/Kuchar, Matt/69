Q. What happened?
MATT KUCHAR: Not sure.  I had a couple of spells where I got a little bit of dizzy and I feel weak.  I don't know where it came from.  I've had plenty of time to get over the travel.  Hopefully it's just something that passes real quick.
Q. Is it something you've experienced before?
MATT KUCHAR: No, no, it's not.
Q. Did it affect you in any way as far as your play on the golf course?
MATT KUCHAR: I shook it off the couple times it happened.  No, it didn't affect.
