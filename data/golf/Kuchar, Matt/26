Q. Some birdies flying and bogey-free for you and Webb today.
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it was awful nice any time you can play a round of golf bogey-free.  Out here there is enough penalties if you miss-hit shots; if you're offline the rough is nasty.  You get in the wrong position around these green and there is so much tilt to them, so much slope, that getting up and down is really challenging.
Obviously pleased to be able to play bogey-free.
Q. Yesterday in our preview show they asked me what kind of player does well around here.  I called it a Matt Kuchar golf course.  I said Matt Kuchar is going to have a good week.  Am I right?  Is this a Matt Kuch golf course?
MATT KUCHAR: Certainly off to a good start.  I am a big fan of this course.  We have a home course down in Sea Island is that done by Harry Colt as well.  Fan of his work.  They've done such a good job with the setup here at well.  It's a fun course to play, challenging course to play, and kind of ticks all the boxes as being a great venue.
Q. We are in Canada.  Raptors or Warriors?
MATT KUCHAR: Wow.  It's going to be a battle, I tell you.  It's going to be a real battle for sure.
Q. How did that round feel?
MATT KUCHAR: It was good.  It was very good.  Yeah.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
MATT KUCHAR: Should we wait for them or...
Q. What was working for you today?
MATT KUCHAR: It was awesome to be bogey-free today.  This course is such a fun course to play.  It's got a lot of birdie opportunities, but it's also got a lot of chances to get yourself in trouble with the rough being as penalizing as it is.  With the greens being as slopey as they are, if you're in the wrong spot around the greens you really don't have a chance.
So to plot my way around, to play bogey-free golf, and to throw in five birdies was definitely a good day.
Q. (Regarding par-5s on the TOUR.)  Is that kind of more a disadvantage because par-5s you can get an eagle, maybe birdie?
MATT KUCHAR: I think most of us do look forward to a par-5 being a scoring hole, an opportunity get one back.  But enough of our championships, they convert a par-5 or two into a par-4.
You look to go out and shoot the lowest score you can.  Regardless of where you try to make birdies or bogeys, sometimes par is irrelevant.  You just try to get the ball in the hole in as few shots as possible.
Does give you a little boost when you know you have a hole coming up to take advantage of and possibly get one back.
Q. This course being just less than 7,000 yards, that's kind of the exception to the rule for the PGA TOUR these days.  Is there an advantage to being that short?  Again, this course requires accuracy.
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I played with Webb Simpson.  He had a great day.  Played with Rory McIlroy; great day.  Webb and I play a very different game than Rory, but ended up with similar scores.
Just there were occasions where Rory would pull out the 3-wood; Webb and I would be on driver.  There were occasions where Rory would be 40 yards past us and we hit driver.  Course can be played many different ways.  It was interesting to see the three of us all playing good golf today.
Q. Do you feel it was an advantage to have an early tee time today?
MATT KUCHAR: I think you'll see good late sores as well.  Looks like a beautiful afternoon.
