 Q.  Take me through your round.  
MATT KUCHAR: Very steady.  Opened up with birdie on the first and birdie on the third.  So got off to a good start.  Then wasn't in much trouble today.  I made a mistake on a club selection on 9, hit it just over the green.  You miss these greens, the rough is challenging to chip out of.  And didn't get up-and-down.   
But other than that, I played some really good steady golf.  Not a whole lot of trouble and a lot of chances for birdies.   
 Q.  Did you feel like the course was gettable today?  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, certainly the scores showed it.  A couple guys went low.  Felt like I had a few more chances, but all in all 4-under par at the PGA Championship on this course is a pretty respectable round.   
 Q.  What is your mentality going into tomorrow being right in there in the top-10?  
MATT KUCHAR: I'll be a ways back with Jason Day playing so well right now, but with the chance and being that far back, certainly I'm going to see if I can't get some birdies, get some momentum going early and hopefully put up a low number.   
 Q.  What have your thoughts been overall on the course for the first three days?  
MATT KUCHAR: Love it.  I played it in 2010 and now begin in 2015 and both experiences have been great.
