 Q.  Not as explosive as yesterday but a really solid performance.  Sum up your day?  
MATT KUCHAR: Solid.  I started off with bogeys on 1 and 2.  First hole I bogeyed every day, it's a really hard hole.  Once I kind of got going after that, it was nice to post a decent round.  Got a stretch in there, had a couple loose wedges on the back nine.  Thought I should have some birdie opportunities and ended up with a par and a bogey, couple wedges in my hand, never happy.  But all in all, 2-under is a nice round of golf.   
 Q.  I want to say this respectfully, but what you've seen of Jordan Spieth, has he flipped a switch since The Open?  
MATT KUCHAR: Listen, he's a great player.  He's tough to beat any week.  When he's driving it well, he's tough to beat.  His irons are great and his putting is great.  At a place like this, it's going to penalize you if you're off, and he's clearly on.  He's going to be a tough man to catch for sure.
