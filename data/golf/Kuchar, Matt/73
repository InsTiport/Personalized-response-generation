 Q.  How solid was that round?  
MATT KUCHAR: It was great.  It's funny, got off to a start -- one point in the round, was 2-over par, was 3-over for the tournament and looking like I needed to do something to hang around for the weekend.   
My caddie, John Wood, came to me on the eighth hole and said:  Come on, let's make some birdies and at least get this thing to even par and won't be too far back from the lead.   
Got on amazing stretch and got to even par and kept going.   
 Q.  How easy did the game feel during that stretch?  
MATT KUCHAR: It was funny, at one point, I remember talking about it.  And kind of the idea of, you know, don't get in your way, don't get in your way of a hot streak, like a pitcher, not talking to the pitcher.   
I remember talking to the guys in my group, to Marc Leishman and Adam Hadwin, like:  Man, got it going, wish I had made that one putt on No. 12, I could have just had six birdies in a row and felt like I might have jinxed it.  But fortunately good things kept going.   
 Q.  You have to tell us, what happened walking off 7 green to 8 tee, because you've gone from a guy who was struggling to make the cut to lights-out golf.  
MATT KUCHAR: I was playing some nice golf.  First few holes are hard.  Certainly the first hole.  I made bogey there.  I actually drove in the fairway, had a good approach just left of the green and walked off with a bogey.  Played steady.  Bogeyed the seventh.   
My caddie says:  Come on, we're 3-over for the tournament, let's try to get this thing back to even.  At even par, you're not too far off the lead.   
So all of a sudden, I don't know if that was enough of the pep talk, but got it back to even and kept going from there.   
 Q.  Have you had a stretch of golf like that?  I know you've played a lot of great golf in your career, but that magnetic; you were 9-under at one stage for 11 holes.  
MATT KUCHAR: It was a good stretch for sure.  I remember, I think it was maybe the 14th hole, maybe the 15th hole, I walk off the green and talked to my playing -- it was 14.   
I walk off 14 talking to Leishman and Adam Hadwin I was playing with and went:  God, if I had just made that putt on No. 12, if I had made that putt, it would be six birdies in a row.   
Typically you don't want to jinx yourself and you don't want to talk about a streak while it's happening.  I parred the next but kept the birdies going on 16 and 17.  It was fun to have this cross my mind; like, Matt, you shouldn't be talking about a streak.   
 Q.  Since the Playoffs have begun, you've just now matched Tiger Woods with eight birdies or more in a round seven different times in the Playoffs.  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I wouldn't have guessed that.  Certainly I kind of think of myself as a steady player.  Maybe not one who is going to get things going.   
But it's a great stat thinking that I'm okay when it's going well to keep it going.  It's something that I think a lot of guys struggle with.  They find themselves 4- or 5- or 6-under par and get outside your comfort level.  It's nice to know you have that comfort level to keep going.
