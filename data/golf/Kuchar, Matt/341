  Q. Well, certainly not the outcome you wanted, but you have to feel good about the way you played all week. I've talked to you every day a couple of times and you felt really confident. Didn't come out with a victory, but you do have to feel good?  
 MATT KUCHAR: As an overall week, yeah, it's been a good week. Four wins and Luke just played great. I have no idea what he was in relation to par, but it was quite a bit under. It seemed like every hole he had a 5-footer for birdie and made it. Tough conditions.  
  
  Q. What will you take away from the week?  
 MATT KUCHAR: I enjoy match play. You just never know. Had I got somebody else on today's round, I may have still been able to come out with a win.   
 But you face Luke Donald on a day he's really hot, you pack your bags early.  
  
  Q. Where do you go from here? Do you play Honda next week?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah.   
  
  Q. We'll see you there.
