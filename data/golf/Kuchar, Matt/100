Q. Was the course any easier today compared to yesterday?
MATT KUCHAR: It feels the same.  Conditions have been really good.  Not much wind.  Ball has been going a long way.  It's hot and humid.  But even with the ball going far and not much wind, it's still a demanding, difficult golf course.  This rough is so penalizing.  Driving is such a critical key around here.
I've been pretty steady, hit a lot of fairways.  So had a fair number of chances.  Even hitting the fairways, the job's not done.
Q. You're a Georgia Tech guy.  I saw you at the College Football Hall of Fame earlier this week throwing up the Heisman.  What's it like to be back in Atlanta this week?
MATT KUCHAR: I really enjoy Atlanta.  Feels like a hometown to me.  It's so much fun to be back.  We go out to a bunch of great restaurants, meet up with a bunch of friends.  It's a busy week but a fun week for me.
