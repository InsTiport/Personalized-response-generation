  Q. Even par-70, but a tough finish for you. Just comment on the day as a whole.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it looked like it was going to be a nice day. I was 3-under with three to go and dropped three shots, but they're three tough holes.   
 16 is probably the hardest fairway on TOUR to hit.   
 17, with that back tee, was a difficult hole and a difficult pin. I felt pretty fortunate to walk away with a bogey there after the tee shot.   
 And 18, as you guys know, it's a 230-yard par-3. It's a mean hole.   
  
  Q. How cold is the water at 17?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Not cold. Not cold. I think my caddie had a pretty good idea to take my sock off and just let my foot and my shoe get wet and go ahead and dry off, put the sock back on. I'm feeling fairly dry right now.  
  
  Q. Which foot did you -- did you leave one shoe on?  
 MATT KUCHAR: I left both shoes on. I just took my right sock off.
