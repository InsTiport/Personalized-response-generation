 Q. Maybe you'll be 100 percent tomorrow or at least close?
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I'm hoping. By the way it's going, I'm hoping that it continues on this right track where I continue to feel better.

 Q. Did the weather today give you any fears coming into the round?
 MATT KUCHAR: I would have preferred a later starting time, a little more time to sleep in and hopefully get a little better just with time. We lucked out, though, with the weather. It turned out to be good. I was not real happy to have a 9:15 time, and when I thought it was going to be a rainy day with a couple delays -- but I think we got pretty lucky.

 Q. Has the medication helped at all? Are you making any progress with your health?
 MATT KUCHAR: I'm feeling better, yes. I'm nowhere near 100 percent, but the difference between yesterday and today was big. I felt much better today.

 Q. Talk about holding it together today, keeping yourself in contention. 
 MATT KUCHAR: I thought I played really steady today. I think I hit just about every fairway today. I think I missed No. 16, and that may be it. Hit a lot of greens, a lot of two-putts. It was a steady day, and I'm excited about the way I'm playing. I think the position I'm in, if I can get going and have a day like today and make a few putts, I'll find myself up there with a chance to win tomorrow. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I wanted so bad to just pull out of the tournament and go home. The last thing I wanted to do was be out here trying to play golf. But I'm very pleased with the way I'm feeling at the moment. 

 Q. Obviously a lot has changed in 13 years, but what would it mean to you to win out here at Cog Hill again, where you kind of launched your name in golf?
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it's a special place to me, and it would be a treat to not only capture an amateur title here but a professional title, as well.
