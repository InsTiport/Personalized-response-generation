 Q.   Matt, a great 36 holes.   Just one bogey over your first two days, so consistently solid play out of you.  
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, it's been good.   I really enjoy this course.   This is a course I think all the players enjoy playing.   It's a fun course, the last couple holes, 15, 16, 17 and 18 are just exciting holes to play, fun holes to play.  
So it's great to be here.   We're having perfect weather.   The course is in great shape, and my game's holding up pretty well.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday we saw a lot of low numbers because the course conditions were a little bit softer.   The rain was coming down.   How are we seeing a difference in the course since it's been a little bit dry?  
MATT KUCHAR:   It's fairly similar.   The greens are firm enough to be really good.   Speed is perfect puttâ€‘making speed, so I think you'll continue to see a lot of low numbers.   I think guys will go low.   There's enough birdie opportunities.  
But the fun thing about this course is it offers a few holes that you gotta step up and really hit good shots or you're going to make bogeys or worse.   So I think it's a great setup out here.  
   
 Q.   Matt, 14 greens...  
MATT KUCHAR:   This course is fun to play, particularly after Pinehurst last week, to come here, be able to hit 14 greens is fun to do.   Last week I think if you hit 10 you were really striking it well.   So this is a pleasant change.   I think it's a course all the players really enjoy, particularly the Back 9.   Those last 15, 16, 17 and 18 are just fun holes to play.   Anything can happen.   You can make eagles and bogeys and double bogeys.   So it's a great stretch and a great golf course.   
   
 Q.   Coming in here off the U.S. Open where you played well, are you fried mentally or are you refreshed to get here?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I would say you tend to be a little bit tired, but your game tends to be pretty sharp.   I think U.S. Open just demands kind of perfection with every club in the bag, and you feel like you get a little sharper, so shots around the green, all those chips that are so tough around Pinehurst, I get around here and feel like I can handle them pretty easily.   So I feel like I'm a little sharper, but it's just keeping the energy up for the next two days.  
   
 Q.   In order to win the tournament you're probably going to have to have one really good round, something 65.   Is that something that excites you or something that weighs on your mind?  
MATT KUCHAR:   No.   I understand that's part of the deal.   The conditions are perfect out here.   The course is in great shape.   You're going to have to shoot a low round.   I don't think four 68s are probably going to do it.   
I'm okay.   Hopefully get hot maybe for two rounds over the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Play well.  
MATT KUCHAR:   All right.   Thanks a lot.
