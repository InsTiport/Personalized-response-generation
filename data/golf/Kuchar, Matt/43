Q. You started with a 50-footer for birdie, pretty good round.  You had that bogey at 2.  But your thoughts on finishing 4-under the first 18?
MATT KUCHAR: Certainly a great start.  I birdied 10, 11, my first two holes, neither of which you think, of where those pins were located, weren't just birdie holes.  And to jump on that early was great, played a great first nine of golf, which is the nine you got to take advantage of.  Bogeyed the 2nd and got one back on the 8th, which is a tough hole.  So awfully pleased to be 4-under.  It was a good steady round of golf and certainly happy with where I stand.
Q. Thoughts on the course conditions you had out there?  How good were the greens?
MATT KUCHAR: The whole course is in great shape.  Greens are firm, they're fast.  You need to be in the fairway to try to get a ball close.  Just, the greens are that firm, you need to be in control to try to have a chance at birdie.
Q. Two wins already this season, you're second in the FedExCup points standings, your confidence level has to be at an all time high right now.
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, certainly, I feel good, I also know that golf is golf still.  You don't everyone it, you're not ever in total control.  Some weeks you get in better control than others.  And I had two awfully nice weeks in Hawaii after the win at the Sony to enjoy.  But then got back to playing a good bit of fun at a couple of the clubs there in Hawaii, had kind of family golf every afternoon and really some good times.  So I stayed -- I still played, still hoping to maintain that sharpness that I had and think it's continued, at least today.
