 Q.   Do you still want to punch me flat on the back of the neck?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I think I have a chilly sense of humor.   It was meant to be funny.   I think I would rather take it out on you, maybe, Steve, or on anybody else.   Nick s a big boy.   I don t want any piece of him.   I think I thought it might be funny.   It was funny in my mind.   I don t know if it was funny in anybody else s mind.  
   
 Q.   What happened out there today?  
MATT KUCHAR:   My putter let me down.   I felt like I got off playing some good golf.   I had a chance on 2 for a‑‑ with a 5‑footer for bogey that I missed.   And then I hit a bad shot on 3.   I hit a bad shot on 5.   I actually hit a good shot on 5 and just started to pull up.   It was in a place I knew I couldn't get up and down with.   
I had a three‑putt on 4, a three‑putt on 7.   It was just very uncharacteristic.   I think it really came down to putting.   I think if I had putted well I was in the match.   I just didn't putt very well.
