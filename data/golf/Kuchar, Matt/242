 Q.   Give us some thoughts on two days that haven't turned out as well as you hoped.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Had a good day yesterday and then today was a bit of a struggle.   Just not as sharp off the tee.   Played too many times out of the rough.   I tell you, this course is a fantastic golf course.   I wasn't on great form and it got the best of me.   I think this course, you'd better be playing well, or else you're going to make some bogeys.  
   
 Q.   You're not used to struggling to make the cut; the last one you missed was the PGA Championship back in August.   What are the emotions like coming down the stretch when you're trying to get it done?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Frustrated to be on the outside right now.   I don't miss many cuts.   It's not something I'm used to doing.   Not a fun position to be in.   It doesn't look very good for me right now to play the weekend, which is disappointing.   I came here looking to play some good golf and knew this golf course suited my eye well.   
I'm surprised I went the whole day without a birdie today.   That's definitely something I'm not accustomed to, either.   A course I enjoy, conditions are fantastic, not much wind, greens were great, and just not able to get a whole lot going today.  
   
 Q.   Whatever happens, have you enjoyed your first visit to France?   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, been a great day.   Really hope that things go my way and I make the cut, but if not, heck, I'm in France, not far away from Paris, get to have a fun weekend.
