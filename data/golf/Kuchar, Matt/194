Q.   You've already been through a grind and these are just the preliminaries. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Major Championship golf is tough.   You kind of know coming in greens are going to be tough, greens are going to be slick out here.   We have had some really good weather.   Even with the rain on Monday, I think what they can do with the SubAir is you get sunshine, you get water, you can control that with the SubAir and the greens are really slick. 
Now we have got some breeze picking up.   This morning conditions were quite nice when I teed off just before nine.   It wasn't until maybe the back nine, when the wind started picking up and really got pretty tough. 
I think most guys will tell you these pin positions are pretty sneaky out here.   There's some tough ones out here.   I imagine the guys who are playing right now are in for a real challenge.

Q.   You got to figure nobody's going to run away from it, right?
MATT KUCHAR:   Bubba Watson certainly has the potential around here.   He could start giving himself a little distance.   But for the most part I think you'll see guys around that even par number. 

Q.   You say Majors are tough, but this is a little bit different usually.   You see birdies and red numbers here.   So how different is the atmosphere here when you're grinding away and every 2‑footer is so difficult?
MATT KUCHAR:   It's a little more quiet.   It took me awhile before I kind of got my little muffled roar. 
On the 6th hole I made 15‑footer and got a good ovation for birdie there.   That was really about it for any sort of the normal birdie roars. 
I think a lot of the birdies I've had have been the par‑5s, where they have been 2‑ or 3‑footers, so not all that exciting for the crowd to really get into.

Q.   What was that putt like on 16?
MATT KUCHAR:   Impossible.   You're going to have anywhere from 10 to 15 feet.   I hit a really good shot and it stayed up high and you go, my only chance of making a par is making a 10‑ or 15‑footer.

Q.   What happened to Louis at 15, when you see that, does that happen here more than anywhere else, where a guy is next to a green and all of a sudden you're looking at a huge number up there?
MATT KUCHAR:   I don't know any other place where that happens.   I think this is it.   It's an amazing thing to be just over the green in two and walk away with a triple.   I don't see that anywhere else but here. 

Q.   Talk about looking ahead to the weekend here and the mentality the player has to have to really finish strong.   It seems this year a lot of guys third round leads done mean a whole lot. 
MATT KUCHAR:   It certainly helps.   The better you play, the better chances you have. 

Q.   What kind of mentality do you have to take to be ‑‑ how different I guess is golf on Sunday here than it is any or day?
MATT KUCHAR:   Just got to keep playing good golf.   I don't know, that's a pretty exciting Thursday morning.   I was pretty excited to come and tee it up Thursday morning.   I think guys certainly get awfully excited when they have a chance Sunday afternoon as well.

Q.   What do you have to do weekend?
MATT KUCHAR:   I just got to play good golf.   I'm playing pretty nice and I feel pretty pleased, not making a whole lot of mistakes.   15's got me for two straight days.   I've been either in the front water or back water, so maybe I can figure out laying up there better.   But all in all I'm really pleased with how things are going. 

Q.   17 without the Eisenhower Tree, what's that like?
MATT KUCHAR:   It's a great hole.   Yeah.   I think it's a nice improvement. 

Q.   The last two weeks you kept it from draining you, you took some energy out of it, thought you were playing well and coming in with momentum. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Coming into Augusta I don't think anybody's ever going to not be excited to come here.   You come here and, regardless of what you've done the past month, I think guys are pretty pumped up, regardless of what's happened. 
So I certainly was excited to be here, knowing that I was in pretty good form.   Any time you come get a chance to play here it's fun.
