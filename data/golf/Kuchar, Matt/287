 Q.   Matt, a tough run through your first nine holes, with a couple of bogeys and a double, then you bounced back with a birdie and you got it going again.   
MATT KUCHAR:   I was awfully excited to get going again.   I got going on the wrong side of things, bogey on 12, was a hard hole and 14 where the tee is up, shouldn't be that hard, made a double bogey there, and it was going the wrong way.   
Glad to bounce back, 16, par 5, took advantage of that, so pleased with the way I was able to hang in there and bounce back.   
   
 Q.   This is such a confidence game.   Have you ever played with as much confidence as you're playing now?   Hit it to 10 feet and making the putt seems to be your formula.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Things are going well, I feel well on the tee ball, and that's crucial thing around most of these courses that we play.   Having the ball in the fairway makes a big difference, particularly with the Bermuda rough.   Last week we had Bermuda rough, this is Bermuda rough, and not much fun to be driving out of that, so driving well and putting well.   
   
 Q.   Spending time with Chris O'Connell this week, you going to be even better?   
MATT KUCHAR:   That's the plan.   I love getting time with Chris.   I always seem to get better after spending time with him and feel like I'm hitting it well and in good form.   
   
 Q.   Your wife mentioned that there was no tennis yesterday, but there may be today.   It's probably your call, is there going to be tennis this afternoon?   
MATT KUCHAR:   Could be.   We got the babyâ€‘sitter lined up for tonight and we are going to enjoy a little adult time.   Could be some tennis this afternoon, we'll have to see.   
   
 Q.   Enjoy it!   
MATT KUCHAR:   Thanks.
