MATT KUCHAR: We've had some great success.  This guy is playing so good, anybody could partner with him and have great success.  For me, playing off where this guy drives it, it's a fun game for me.
Q. You were perfect at Medinah four years ago.  Here you are winning again.  What is about this atmosphere that brings out the best in your play?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: Well, especially here on your home turf, the fans they just they kind of bring it out in you.  You are not here playing for yourself, you are here playing for your team, the country and all the fans.
It's a lot of fun.  Me and Kuch have a lot of fun together out there.  We partner very well together and our games complement.
