Q. 2-under today.  How was that?
MATT KUCHAR: It was good.  It was definitely more challenging today.  The wind was up a little bit more.  Some challenging pin positions.  Certainly see some good scores.  You see Dustin Johnson making tons of birdies.  It's certainly doable.  But I feel like I played some good, steady golf.  I'm very happy with 2-under.
Q. Is there any part of the game you thought was the best today?
MATT KUCHAR: I continue to drive the ball well.  Again, putting it in the fairways, a must-do.  Out of the rough, it's so hard to control the rough.  Bermudarough, you're not sure if it's going to sit down; you're not sure if you're going to get a flyer.  Trying to getting one close is nearly impossible out of the rough, so driving it well was key and I continued to do a good job today.
Q. You've played two competitive rounds here; what's the tactics tomorrow?  Is there any change in your tactics?
MATT KUCHAR: No.  Keep trying to do the same thing.  It's a pretty boring way to play, but it's just the style I play.
Q. But you like your position going into the weekend?
MATT KUCHAR: Always like to be ten, 20, 30, 40 shots ahead.  Nothing you can do about what's happening.  Two rounds, I've played two steady rounds, and we'll continue to try to do the same.
