  Q. 29-10-4 overall in this championship.  Of course you're a past champion as well.  This is seen as an upset by some.  Would you consider it that?
 MATT KUCHAR:   Sure, I'm not sure that many people have been picking me this week and certainly after the last few weeks I mean there's no chance you would pick me, but big thanks to Chris O'Connell, we have been working hard the last kind of month or two and continue refining being continue tweaking and kind of stayed the course and thankfully things kind of came together the last few days with some good work here and feeling a whole lot more like my old self again and it's a lot more fun.
 Q. You were 5-up as you made the turn, what were you able to do so well to put Justin on the ropes early?
 MATT KUCHAR:   Well, I wedged it great, putted really well.  So I had a handful of short irons, wedge opportunities, put those close, made a few putts, Justin got a few bad break, that's kind of the way things go and I was fortunate to get that sort of lead against him.
