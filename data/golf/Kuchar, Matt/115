Q. How happy are you to have this round put away and not have to come early in the morning?
MATT KUCHAR: We got pretty lucky there with the weather clearing up, having a couple holes.  The warmup range session, it wasn't a whole lot of fun.  It was looking nasty with wind and rain.  It's always nice to finish the evening off so you don't have to start too early.  Get a couple hours of sleep.  I think we all relish those few hours of sleep.
Q. You go into the final round now tied for the lead.  You've won this tournament.  Is there any carryover?
MATT KUCHAR: I love this golf course.  This is the highlight for me of the year.  Certainly got great memories here.  My track record is very good.  I've had a lot of success here, having a win back in '13.  I'll certainly be looking forward to tomorrow's round of golf.
Q. What do you think it will take tomorrow, as far as the scoring?
MATT KUCHAR: I don't know.  What do you think?
Q. (No microphone)?
MATT KUCHAR: Your guess is as good as mine.
Q. You had it going before the horn.  How hard is that to kind of regroup?
MATT KUCHAR: Part of the deal.  We do it a lot during the year.  It's something that you kind of better get accustomed to.  I came out and hit a not very good shot on 16, made a nice up-and-down.
A couple of really good shots on 17.
It's never fun to bogey 18, but almost felt glad to bogey 18 at the same time.  I could have made a mess of it at 18.
Q. How was your lie in the bunker at 18?
MATT KUCHAR: It was very good, yeah.
Q. What happened to your tee shot on 4?  Epic bounce?
MATT KUCHAR: I hit a sprinkler.  Yeah, some of those things that just unlucky.  I got some good bounces.  I told my caddie after that, I said, these things tend to even out, but we're due for some good breaks.  That was clearly a very bad break.  I hit a beautiful shot in there that hit a sprinkler and just went way in the wrong direction.
But what was it, 11, I hit a ball just right of the green and it took a nice bounce left onto the green.  I don't know if that's exactly even.  Maybe due one or two good ones tomorrow.  But it's kind of part of the deal.
Q. You know Jack wants this golf course to play fast and firm, but most years the weather does not cooperate.  When you come here, do you plan on weather?  Is this a mudder's golf course?
MATT KUCHAR: Typically, I always have a base layer and a ski cap coming here and make sure my rain gear is packed and ready to arrive and play.
Q. Is this a mudder's golf course then?
MATT KUCHAR: That's not what I said.  I said I'm prepared for anything.
