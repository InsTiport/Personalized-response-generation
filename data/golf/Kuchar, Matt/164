 Q.   How do you feel about your play today?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Disappointing to go birdie free today.   I played nice golf.   I hit it I felt like very well.   I had a number of really good chances on the Back 9.   
Front nine not so many legitimate birdie opportunities, but a fair bit on the back and wasn't able to get one to go in.   
Impressive was Jimmy was doing.   I was hoping to get a little pressure on.   I had putts on 1, 2, 3, all decent looks for birdies and trying to get one to go and nothing did.   And Jimmy never really missed a shot.   Driving was just so impressive.   Just absolutely put on a driving clinic and made the game look pretty easy.  
   
 Q.   Like you're saying you're trying to get something going and you're kind of spinning your wheels a little bit, how do you snap out of something like that or what's going through your mind mentally I guess?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Keep plugging along.   I mean I watched his lead grow in the middle of the round by a long stretch that I bogeyed eight to his birdie and birdied 9 and 10, and I was going, oh, man.   It's not completely out of reach.   I still could make some birdies and see what I can do, and not able to get anything; and he kept making birdies and just played a great round of golf today.   
   
 Q.   How well did you know him before his kind of stretch the last couple of years?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Not that well.   
   
 Q.   No?   Do you know him any better now?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah.   We've become good friends.   I think he's a good guy, enjoys company.   Enjoyed the round today.   We always enjoy playing together.   I had even talked to him about being Ryder Cup partners.   We get along well.   
You know, I think highly of his game as well.  
   
 Q.   What's your schedule going forward the next couple of weeks?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Playing Bob Hope and Phoenix.   
   
 Q.   Solid week for you at Wailaie.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah.   Yeah.   It was a good week.   You know, tough day when you got a chance to win a golf tournament and don't make a birdie all day.   Frustrating, but Wailaie has been good to me.   I really do enjoy my time here.   I always look forward to coming this week.   Every year this is one I really get excited to come be a part of.   
   
 Q.   As well as Jimmy plays, were you thinking you could come in today, be aggressive‑‑  
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah.   I knew what he did yesterday and how well he plays this course and how well he's playing.   He looked good last week.   He should have won last week.   He's in great form, and I figured it would be ‑‑ I'd have to shoot a good number today to have a chance.
