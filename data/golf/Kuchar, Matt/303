 Q.   6‑under par, just comment on your round?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Another steady round of golf.   Feel good about the way I'm hitting it.   Getting some putts to drop in.   All in all really pleased.  
   
 Q.   11‑under par, a little bit back right now.   Just talk about what you'd have to do tomorrow?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I think this place is a tough golf course.   It was really windy Thursday and still enough wind to make it exciting Friday, Saturday.   Some of the scores going on are pretty crazy.   Bubba Watson has played a lot of great golf.   It will take a lot of things go my way to have a chance tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Any birdies stand out for you today?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Pretty steady.   It was nice to bounce back with a birdie on 17 after I bogeyed 16.   16 is one of those holes you look to take advantage of and made a bogey there.   So nice to bounce back with a birdie there on 17.
