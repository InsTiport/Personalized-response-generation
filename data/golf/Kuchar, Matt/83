Q. Matt Kuchar, you open up with a 66.  What were the keys today?
MATT KUCHAR: Control the ball.  I went ahead and pulled driver on a lot of holes.  Some of the holes where you see guys hit, gives you a lot of options.  You see guys lay back.  I went ahead and was aggressive.  I was driving it well.  Finding fairways and giving myself much shorter irons in.  Able to take advantage on some of those holes.
Q. At what point during the round did you feel like this was a day you could post a pretty solid number?
MATT KUCHAR: Awfully breezy out there, had some challenges for sure.  I think on a lot of these holes you got a lot of crosswinds with hazards on one side or the other and certainly places to make mistakes.
So, you never I got to go and see how deep I can go.  Just go along and take advantage of what you can.
