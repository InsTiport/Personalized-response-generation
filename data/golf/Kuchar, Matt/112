 Q. First of all, your round, a difficult day for part of it?  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I think I got the better bit of the wave this afternoon not having to deal with as much of the rain. Just playing some pretty nice golf, similar to yesterday. Was bummed to bogey 9 and 10.   
Certainly 9 is one of the easier holes out here, so to make bogey there was a bummer. And 10, the par5, a challenging drive. But after that, you're really looking on that hole to make birdie and I walked away with two bogeys there.   
Aside from that, I felt like I played some nice golf. There's a stretch of holes, I think that starts with 11, where I felt like I was hitting 5‑iron or hybrid for the next four holes into greens, played those even. And then had a nice stretch on the closing, which is kind of the holes that you can, 15, 16, 17, 18; you can take advantage of, and at least birdied 16 and 18.  
   
 Q. What happened on 9 and 10?   
MATT KUCHAR: Hit a nice drive on 9. Had kind of a three‑quarter wedge shot and I chunked it. There's some turf that gets grainy. I watched Danny Willett do the same thing yesterday. You feel like with a wedge in your hand, you're looking forward to hitting a good shot. But some of the lies here, you can hit some lousy ones, and I hit a bad one. That was it. I just chunked a wedge shot and had a difficult chip from there.   
   
 Q. And 10?  
MATT KUCHAR: 10, drove it in the right waste area there. Was lucky to be able to have a reasonable pitch out but still, had 230 or so to the hole and wasn't able to kind of save par there.   
   
 Q. We talked yesterday to some guys about it was a disappointing day for the Americans in general, if we look at it on Olympic standards. Today was a little better, but all four of you guys are far away from Fraser and Pieters and Stenson. How do you look at it?   
MATT KUCHAR: We are a long way off, but I haven't seen what the other guys' totals are. I feel like I've at least got still a fighting chance to get on the podium and still even win the tournament.   
We've seen a good score is possible. Fraser put that 8‑under out yesterday. With a good weekend, it's not impossible, but certainly not where any of us would like to be after two rounds.
