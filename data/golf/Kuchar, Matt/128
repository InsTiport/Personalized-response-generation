Q. You couldn't wait to get out of here.  You had to make a 28-footer on the last green?
MATT KUCHAR: That was an exciting finish for me, to chip in on the 12th down there and then make a 30-footer here to close the match out.  My short game was quite amazing.  I made some incredible up-and-downs.
If you start on the first hole, I hit a beautiful drive, beautiful iron shot that went over the green.  Hit an amazing shot to 15 feet and made the putt and ended up winning hole.  It just seemed like that was my day.  I hit a lot of good shots.  But if I was in trouble, I made some amazing recoveries.
Q. This is such a long week.  It's really important to conserve your energy, end matches early, both mentally and physically?
MATT KUCHAR: It is a nice bonus.  Certainly teeing off at 3:10, it felt like a British Open.  To be able to wrap it up early and have dinner at normal hours is a nice thing.
