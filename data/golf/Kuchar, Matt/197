 Q.   Was it too much to overcome what happened there today?  
MATT KUCHAR:   No, no, it was a setback, but it wasn't too much to overcome.   It put me back to even par after three or four holes.   It's not the worst thing to be even par through four.  
   
 Q.   Do you look up at the leaderboard at all after you made the turn and you got to Amen Corner?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I knew I was‑‑ at one point at three back through 11 holes.   I made birdie there.   I hit a great shot on the 12th, thinking it would be nice to start a run here.   Just missed the putt on 12.  
And then tried to be too aggressive on 13.   I ended up making a nice par there.  
But once I got through 15, I had a good second on the 15, played what I thought was a decent bunker shot, it just wouldn't stop.   Kind of just saw shots continue to just slip away.  
16, another feeling like I still had an outside chance.   Hit a great approach into 16, hit a great putt that just broke more than I thought it would.  
And then actually I played a great hole on 17.   Made bogey.   
And hit a great tee shot on 18 that caught the left limb.   It was one that was not in play for most people, but that hole sets up for a cut and it just nipped the limb and drove it‑‑ I don't know, 150 yards off the tee or something.  
   
 Q.   You said you had a lot of holes to recover after 4.   But you had the high at 3.   And then was a shock to the system, then, just walk into‑‑  
MATT KUCHAR:   No, no, I was still okay with it.   I knew golf you have ups and downs.   Those things happen.   I can't recall the last time I 4‑putted.   But if there was ever a place to do it‑‑ the first putt was a long, uphill putt.   I came up six feet short, seven feet short, hit a great second putt that caught the top side and kind of one of those power lips and goes seven feet by.   And all of a sudden walk off with a double bogey.   And I think I've hit some pretty good shots.  
But I swallowed that pretty quickly and said that's okay, I'm even par through four holes.  
   
 Q.   Was the driver giving you a little bit of trouble?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, the driver was not near as sharp.   I hit what I thought were a couple decent drives.   At 9 I thought was a decent drive, caught some trees.   18, same thing.   11, missed the fairway.   It seemed to miss the fairway just by little bits here and there.   It was not nearly as sharp as it was yesterday and hard to play really good golf out here if you're not playing from the fairway.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what you said to Jordan and Bubba when they came up?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Just congratulations, great playing.   
   
 Q.   Was the back nine a little harder than maybe it had been?   There weren't a lot of birdies out there on the back nine, did you notice that at all?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I look at 17 and playing uphill into the wind and I had 200 yards to the hole, pin tucked over the bunker.   I had a 5‑iron as high as I could, thinking that would be good, lands in the middle of the green and goes over the green.   17 was not very accessible.  
15, generally we get that back right pin that's more accessible than that middle pin.  
Other than that, those two seemed harder than normal.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us what you take from today, another Sunday on the leaderboard at the Masters?  
MATT KUCHAR:   It's an exciting place to be.   But it's a tough one.   I don't know how many opportunities you get at winning the Masters tournament.   And I've had two this far.   I don't know how many more I'll get.   It's one of those things you get in the situation and you hope to take advantage but it's a lot better in this position than playing early on Sunday, that's for sure.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you need to press, though?   You say you don't know how many more opportunities you'll get, does that make you press a little more each time you come back here?  
MATT KUCHAR:   No, no.   You do what you can when you get opportunities.   Certainly I know better than to press in the game of golf.
