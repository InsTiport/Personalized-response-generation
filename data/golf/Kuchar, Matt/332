   MATT KUCHAR: Getting started this morning, I think seven holes to play, and starting on the 12th hole, normally a fairly benign par 5 that maybe was reachable in two; and this morning it was a driver, 3-wood, 6-iron. So just completely different. 
 Played awfully tough this morning. I think the last six holes eased up a little bit and was more playable and chances for some birdies. But all in all I think the Blue Monster showed a little more teeth this afternoon. 

 Q. Plenty of birdies?
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, playing well. The bermudarough out here is so tricky and difficult that if you're just off the fairways it's hard to figure out and it's going to jump up, and it's just a guessing game of how far it's going to go. The greens are just firm enough where if you are not in the fairway, you're really struggling.
