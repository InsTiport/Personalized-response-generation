   MATT KUCHAR: Playing out of the fairways makes life a whole lot easier than playing out of the rough out here.  
  
  Q. There's only one guy between you and McIlroy, so how does that make you feel?   
 MATT KUCHAR: If McIlroy keeps playing the way he does, he's uncatchable, but I can't control what he does. I'm just going to play the best I can and add them up after 72 holes and see how I do.  
  
  Q. And how about being a former USGA champion playing well at another USGA event, that has to give you a lot of pride?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, yeah, it's fun to be here. I love U.S. Opens, I love the test of golf. I feel like my game is suited pretty well for these type of events where birdies are tough to come by. I feel like I'm a steady player where a hit of lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens and generally do pretty well at U.S. Opens.   
  
  Q. Do you look at the scoreboard? Do you try to ignore it?   
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, you can't control what Rory does. It's some awesome playing. I'm not a big scoreboard watcher, particularly at this moment. I'm playing some good golf and I hope to continue playing some good golf.   
  
  Q. What's the weekend strategy? Obviously try to catch Rory or hope he backs up. How do you approach it?   
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I've been playing well, and I'll continue with my strategy of hitting a lot of fairways. The more fairways you hit, just makes life a whole lot easier than playing out of this rough. I'm going to continue to try to play out of some fairways over the weekend.   
  
  Q. What did you find today that was to your liking?   
 MATT KUCHAR: I finished well today. I took advantage of the birdie holes. I birdied 6, 8 and 9, and those are holes you're looking to take advantage, and I did that today.
