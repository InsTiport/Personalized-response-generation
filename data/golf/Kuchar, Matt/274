Q.   Looked like the day‑‑
MATT KUCHAR:   Actually played I thought as good as I played this week.   I felt like I drove it better.   I felt like my irons were better today.   The pins were tough.   I putted really well the first two days, but today not as sharp.
I look back and the first two days I felt like most of my birdie putts were 15, 20 feet that were right edge or left edge, and today those same 15‑ or 20‑footers were two feet out.   They're a lot harder to make at that distance.

Q.   Paul Lawrie said the same thing, he said he thought he played tee‑to‑green the best he's played all week. 
MATT KUCHAR:   No, I think it was just a matter of the pin locations.   I think it was a matter of‑‑ like I said, it's easy to make relatively straight putts.   You just have to get the line right.   The speed is not as important.   But when you've got two feet of break, you've got to have speed and line, and it's harder to make those.
