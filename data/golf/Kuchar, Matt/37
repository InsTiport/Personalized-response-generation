Q. Overall thoughts on the match and the win?
MATT KUCHAR: It's a tough match and a great win.  I'm exciting to move on to the final eight.
Q. What is it about this format that's enabled you so much success?  You won here in 2013.  It seems like you make the quarters almost every year.
MATT KUCHAR: I wish I had an answer for you.  I don't have an answer.  There's no substitute for good play, though, and I try to just play steady golf.  And that was the formula today, just steady golf.
Q. What do you think it will be like this afternoon?  Obviously the conditions are getting a little tougher out there with the wind?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, final eight you're going to be playing somebody in really good form.  It's going to be a tough match, particularly in these conditions.  Pars will be good scores out there today.
Q. How was your play today? what was working for you out there?
MATT KUCHAR: It was just good.
