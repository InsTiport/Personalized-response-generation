Q. Gary was just mentioning how great your record is in match play.  What is it about this format that brings out the best in you?
MATT KUCHAR: I'm not sure.  We've had a couple of very different courses in Dove Mountain and now here at Austin Country Club.  I think just steady golf.  I don't really change strategy much.  I try to play the best shot for the moment.  I try not to give any holes away, no bogeys if possible.  It's kind of my standard game.  I think it just -- it certainly works for me.  And it's been a successful formula thus far.
Q. A lot of the guys tell us in this format versus stroke play there's a little more urgency.  It's not like a first round of a stroke play event.  How do you stay so steady in a format that has so many ebbs and flows to it?
MATT KUCHAR: There is a lot of ebbs and flows.  There is a lot of momentum that goes on.  I lost the first hole.  And anytime you're down, it stinks when you're down.  And then on the 12th hole John, my caddie, was trying to get me to lay up short to have a good angle at the green, but I had a number where I could get to it, and a played too aggressively and made a mess of it.  And all of a sudden I had just given a hole away.  It's so frustrating in match play giving holes away.  I think I do a pretty good job of avoiding that, but it stinks, and to have momentum and be 1-up and then to lose that hole and go even, all of a sudden you're starting to sweat it again.  There's a lot of momentum swings and it's tricky to deal with.
Q. Good win for you.  You dropped the first hole and I know you don't like that.  And 12 was not a good hole for you either, but you came back and really played solid?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I lost the first hole to birdie, and you kind of go 1-down.  You know after the first hole, there's 17 more holes to play.  You know you've got a chance.  And then it got late in the round.  I was 1-up and lost the 12th hole, made a mess of things.  My caddie, John Wood, tried to get me to play smart and I unfortunately did not and made a mess and gave the hole away.  And all of a sudden what a difference from 1-up to even.  And I felt like I was barely in control of the match.  And then dropping to even I'm sweating things.
Nice to get a birdie and then close out the hole.  To close the match on 17, it's a nice feeling.
Q. Our analysts have been talking about your success with the U.S. Amateur, the Presidents Cup, the Ryder Cup.  You really are a good match play player.
MATT KUCHAR: I don't know what there is to it.  I really don't change strategy at all.  I think I play a steady game of golf.  I don't make many bogeys.  And I give myself chances.  Stay in a lot of holes and a pretty good short game bails me out, if I do get in trouble.  I don't know if there's a rhyme or reason or formula or maybe just a mentality where I'm pretty easygoing and all the ebbs and flows, all the swings of momentum don't quite bother me too much.
I really do enjoy the match play format.  It's nerve-wracking, the up-and-downs.  I really do enjoy it.
