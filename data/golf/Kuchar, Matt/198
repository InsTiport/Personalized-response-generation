 Q.   Talk about the day.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Exciting to be in this position, to be close on Saturday, moving day, went ahead and made a move and played some really good golf.   
I feel like I've been playing good, certainly my third week in a row now with some really nice playing.   It's nice to continue it.   
I had the great weeks in San Antonio and then Houston, hoping the trend continued.   Felt pretty good that I would keep up the good play.   Nice to have it really come through and be teeing off late on Sunday at the Masters.   It's a fun place to be.   
   
 Q.   You've been playing so consistently lately.   What's changed?   
MATT KUCHAR:   No change.   Just kept it going.   It's been good.   I drove it really well today.   I don't know that I missed a fairway.   
Approaches have been really clean.   Around here I think that's a real key is being pretty precise with your approach shots.   Everything was pretty clean.   Had a lot birdie opportunities and saw a few putts go in today.   So it was fun.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
MATT KUCHAR:   I hope a lot.   One, there's a comfort level with routine and habit.   It was great to have a shot last Sunday to try to win a tournament.   That's an amazing position to be in.   I'm hoping to get another crack at it come tomorrow afternoon.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
MATT KUCHAR:   It's exciting.   It was a couple years ago, on the outskirts, and I eagled the 15th hole to momentarily tie for the lead.   Just a real thrill to be that close, that far along on a Sunday.   
I'm certainly excited about my chances for tomorrow.   It's going to be one of those unique and special days.
