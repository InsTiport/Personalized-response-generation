Q.   (No Microphone.)
MATT KUCHAR:   Probably the guys that didn't play well. 
(Laughter.)

Q.   How about the guys in the middle?
MATT KUCHAR:   I don't know.   Everybody's got to play the same course.   I don't know why ‑‑ as long as the ball won't stop, everybody's got to play it. 

Q.   Let's assume that Phil wins.   I know it's a big illusion.   But what do you think that means for the Tournament itself?
MATT KUCHAR:   I think it's going to be great regardless.   You got Stricker, Hunter, Justin Rose.   Everybody's a fantastic name up there.   It's an awesome leaderboard.

Q.   And Phil has come so close so many times.   What do you think that says about his resiliency? 
MATT KUCHAR:   He's a fantastic player.   It shows that just his career record on the PGA TOUR, I don't know how many, 40 something wins or something like that, it's just, he's a great player and you figure he's going to get one sooner or later.

Q.   Winning or not winning a U.S. Open doesn't define Phil Mickelson, is what you're saying? 
MATT KUCHAR:   You got to ask Phil. 

Q.   Would you welcome a championship coming back here at Merion?
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, it's awesome.   I hope sooner the better. 

Q.   It's been five years since Tiger won a Major.   Can you talk about that?
MATT KUCHAR:   It's a good question.   I don't know.   There's still a lot of time left.   I think what was ‑‑ Hogan won how many after 36?   How many did Hogan win after the age of 36?   So it's still doable.

Q.   Where would you rank this golf course as far as toughness is concerned?
MATT KUCHAR:   One of the Top‑10 for sure.   No question. 

Q.   What makes it so tough?
MATT KUCHAR:   Nobody can break par. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
MATT KUCHAR:   I don't think any worse.   I definitely don't work any worse. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
MATT KUCHAR:   At first I thought I might go see Philly, but there were a lot of late nights and unfortunately I wasn't able to make it down.
