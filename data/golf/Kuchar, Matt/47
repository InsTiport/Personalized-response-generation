 Q.  Obviously kind of a strange day for a lot of circumstances.  How would you describe what happened today?  
MATT KUCHAR: Crazy.  Crazy.  It looked like Justin and I were playing for second place and then all of a sudden the 11th hole happened.  It's a hard hole but Rickie looked like he played smart, laying up short right of the green.  And I got too aggressive with the chip.  I thought it went in the back bunker.  And then all of a sudden I heard the crowd really groan and we're like holy cow, that just went in the water.  And I don't think I've ever seen what happened with the placement happen -- I always thought it could -- and amazing to see that happen in this situation.  It would be weird to have it happen on a Thursday, but to have it happen to the leader on Sunday.   
 Q.  What about for you on the 15th there?  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I knew I didn't have my A game.  Conditions were hard.  I was kind of trying to steer it around and then hit a couple good shots.  Made the birdie on 13.  And then 15 you've got four exciting holes to play and I was right there.  Any time I struggle with missing left, I struggle.  I missed one left there, missed one left on 17.  Those are typically just not misses I have.  And when I'm doing that it, I know it's going to be a tough day for me and unfortunately it came out at a bad time.
