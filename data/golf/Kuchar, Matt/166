Q. Just your feelings about how tough a road this had to be for the team today to wake up and do this?MATT KUCHAR: It's a massive hurdle.  A lot of those guys are playing good.  I know a lot of our guys are playing good.  A 4-down deficit is a big one to overcome. For a while the board was looking really good with a lot of red.  I'm hoping to get back out as quick as I can to see if I can't cheer some guys on and put some more red up on the board.Q. Speak about your match and when you thought you had a chance to keep it in your control?MATT KUCHAR: I knew I was playing really good this week.  My match with Bubba against Rose and Stenson was awesome.  Everybody played great golf.  I knew I was on good form. I think yesterday afternoon, a little fatigued.  I didn't play my best with Zach.  Came out this morning and was hitting it right where I wanted to.  Really playing some good golf.  I told Thomas he saw me at my best today.  I really played some nice golf.Q. When in this match did you take control?MATT KUCHAR: You never take full control.  It was nice to get up.  I got 4-up at one point, and then Thomas on 11 hit an amazing shot out of the rough and got one back.  All of a sudden, I'm thinking let's not give any more back.Q. No reason to explain why our foursomes just couldn't get some points?MATT KUCHAR: No, no.  You just have no explanation.  That's just the way golf goes
