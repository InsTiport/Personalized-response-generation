Q.   How would you describe the last four holes? 
MATT KUCHAR:   No, no, I can't remember actually, yeah, the two par‑3, what is it?   16?   15.   15 is a tough little one with that back hole location.   That's a difficult hole with the water left and my shot shape.   I got to be really aggressive there and kind of take it down the water line.   And I took it down the middle of the green and it faded, it was just nearly an impossible up‑and‑down if you miss the green right there. 
So, understood that that was a tough place to miss it. 
Then 17, similar, however, only with a pitching wedge, you're looking to hit a good shot.   Unfortunately, I let it hang too much and it caught a rock and went in the water. 
Then you come to 18 and then figure you can get a birdie there.   I hit a great drive and was in between kind of a three and four hybrid four, I went with a three hybrid, trying to get it back to the hole and a solid shot that just didn't fade. 
So, no really bad shots, just made a couple lesser quality shots that I lost some shots. 
But the beauty about the game is we got four rounds and I got another chance tomorrow.

Q.   In such cruise control for the first 14 holes today and really for the entire tournament, how much of a shock was it to have a finish like that?
MATT KUCHAR:   You know, a day like today, trying to not make a bogey, and then on that ‑‑ I'm blanking on the holes, 15?   Is that the par‑3?   I bogeyed 15 and got right back with a great chance on 16.   I hit two nice shots in there to have a nice birdie putt and missed that. 
But still feeling good.   Then still feeling fine about bogeying 17 and coming to 18 with a good chance. 
It's too bad, but it's what happened and I know I still got one more day left to try to make some birdies and still pull this thing out.

Q.   That's the redeeming thing, now you have 18 holes left you know you have to make a lot of birdies, right there?
MATT KUCHAR:   Exactly.   Regardless if I birdied 18 or parred 18 or whatever happened, I still have to make a lot of birdies tomorrow and I may have to make a couple more now, but it will be fun to still have a chance tomorrow. 

Q.   Do you watch the leaderboard?   Do you know where everybody is at that point?
MATT KUCHAR:   No, Saturday is not important.   It's not important until Sunday on 16.
