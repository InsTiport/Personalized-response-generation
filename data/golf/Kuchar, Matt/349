 Q. Talk about how you felt when the putt went in on 17?
 STEWART CINK: You know, the look and the reactions on the green after we had made birdie there kind of says it all. But I was afraid the turning point was going to come on 15 when I zinged one into the bunker out of the rough and lost that hole. But I'm glad we turned that around, the 16th hole was big, and the putt on 17, in Ryder Cup those are like poison darts.

 Q. Matt, this guy asked to play with you; pleased he did?
 MATT KUCHAR: I called this guy a horse earlier; I think the right term would be a thoroughbred. This guy is one stud here. It's been a pleasure playing with him and looking forward to going out again with him.

 Q. How aware were you of what was going on elsewhere with other matches and your match was pretty crucial to get that lead?
 STEWART CINK: I had a sense our match was very important today. Not many matches were more than 1-up either way, and when you're in the last match, anyway, you always want to come through with the last point, so I could see that it was close and we are just tickled that we got the point. Those guys are tough to play against. 

 Q. Matt, obviously this is your first Ryder Cup, is it as you imagined it would be? 
 MATT KUCHAR: Bigger, way bigger, we get down on the low holes and look up to the 17th hole, the 16th hole where there is just a sea of people and the intensity that people bring, it's just outstanding. It's so much fun to be inside the ropes and to be hitting shots. Sometimes you pull off some miraculous shots it's such a great feeling.

 Q. Harder mentally or physically to go again? 
 STEWART CINK: Well, with the adrenaline pumping, I think it's mentally the most challenging, but me and Kuchar don't have to adjust too much, we are playing together once again, so that will be great. But we are pumped. This Ryder Cup brings out the most energy in golf, and we are all riding the wave and we won't be tired until we hit the dinner table tonight.
