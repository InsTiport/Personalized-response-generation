Q. There's ways of winning, aren't there?  You put a hole-in-one in there, it's extra special.  Tell us about that hole-in-one.
MATT KUCHAR: Any time you get a hole-in-one, it's awfully special, awfully fun.  In this format it's cool.  There's kind of two sides of it in this format.  It guarantees you a win most likely.  And on the other side, it may just win you a hole by one, 1-up.
I think in typical stroke play, getting a hole-in-one, you figure you gain two shots on the field and you are up a little more than normal.  Even my opponent in match play, I think they kind of shake their head a bit at the occasional loss of hole.  But for a hole-in-one, Ross Fisher was awfully -- if ever you lose a hole, you don't mind losing one to a hole-in-one.
Q. It kind of teased, didn't it, as it rolled down the hill?
MATT KUCHAR: It was straight downwind, so we had to land the ball short and play for some run out.  Then there's a bank that -- a slope that takes the ball from left to right.  When I hit the ball, I knew it was a good line and had potential to be close for a good-looking birdie.  As it kept rolling, it kept getting closer and closer and finally it disappeared.  And it was fun to be up at elevation and see the ball the entire way and see it disappear.  That's always a special thing in the game of golf.
