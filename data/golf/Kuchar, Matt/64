 Q.  What was the key to the game for you today?  
MATT KUCHAR: Drove it well.  Found a lot of fairways.  If you're not playing in fairways, you're just hoping for pars.   
If you drive it off line, the rough here is tricky.  The rough here, you don't want to be in the rough.  And missed greens, similar; you have bermuda that you don't want to play out of.   
 Q.  How are conditions?  Any mud balls affect you?  
MATT KUCHAR: No.  I don't know if too many people are going to be complaining about conditions.  This is as nice as I remember it being, blue skies, sunshine, very little wind, beautiful day.   
 Q.  Overall, happy with your opening round?  
MATT KUCHAR: Yes.
