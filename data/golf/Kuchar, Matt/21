Q. What's your assessment of where you stand and your prospects heading into tomorrow?
MATT KUCHAR: Wait and see how the day plays out until Gary and Justin finish.  I'm disappointed.  I got to 4-under kind of through 7 holes and felt really, really good about where I was climbing up the leaderboard and drop a few and end up 1-under par.  It's disappointing.
But you look at, it's a U.S. Open, I'm under par.  I shot another under par round.  It's hard to knock it.  But when I got to 4-under, I was sure excited about my position.  And I hate dropping shots and dropped a couple coming in.
Q. Did it feel like a U.S. Open?
MATT KUCHAR: When I was in the rough, yes.  I had a couple fortunate ones early on in the week.  And today, man, they up were grabbing and turning and twisting.  I don't recall getting a good one in the rough today.  So, yes, that part certainly felt a lot more U.S. Open-like.  Shoot, it's Pebble Beach, it's the U.S. Open setup.  The course is fantastic.  It's just been really fun to play.
Q. You're friends with Gary?
MATT KUCHAR: Gary, when he's on, makes golf look easy.  He's putting well.  If you're leading, you're doing everything well.  And he can make the game look awfully easy, and around this place to be at double digits under par, he's playing great.
Q. Is there any difficulty in drowning out the fan calls out at 18th green, is there any difficulty with focusing on the task at hand when you hear things like that?
MATT KUCHAR: I've been pretty good.  Fortunately as a whole everybody has been great.  Every now and then you get somebody that does that.  Nice to hear the guy get jeered afterwards.  So for the most part it's been awfully good things.  You get the occasional call-out.  But, no, I really haven't struggled too much on that.
Q. What is your take on having probably the best season of your career, mixed with a season where you've had controversy?
MATT KUCHAR: I've never had any controversy, so it's been an interesting year up to this point with the bits of controversy I've been through.  But listen, it's also been such a thrill playing good golf, having a couple of wins.  Winning is such a challenge, and to get two a season has been a thrill for me.
And being in contention.  Golf is fun when you're in contention.  I'm a long shot tomorrow, but in contention.  Certainly excited about the position.  And it's been a great year up to this point.
Q. Do you feel like you're playing your best golf ever, and why do you think that is?
MATT KUCHAR: I think when we all sit down at year's end, you look to get better.  It's hard to put your finger on goals and say I want to win multiple times, I want to win majors.  It's hard to kind of make those happen.  But you look to just constantly improve.
And in the off-season that's really what I worked towards.  It's the little things that add up to big differences.  I can't put my finger on one thing that I'm doing much better than last year, it's just the addition of getting a little bit better all around.
