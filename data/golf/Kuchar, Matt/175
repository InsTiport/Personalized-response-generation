 Q.  Seems like it was kind of an uphill battle the whole way, but you took it right to the end?  MATT KUCHAR: We played really good golf, both teams did.  Each team one won hole with a par, other than that a lot of good shots were hit.   Q.  Pace of play in terms of format?  Do you like this format?  MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, yeah, it's fun.  It's a fun format.  We don't play much of it, but when we do it's enjoyable, the speed of the pace.   Q.  What did you think was the difference in the match that enabled Europe to win?  MATT KUCHAR: They hit a couple of putts and always seems the difference in match play.  Their team made a couple, we fortunately had a couple just hang on the edge.   Q.  Talk about the conditions this afternoon as far as the wind?  MATT KUCHAR: Conditions are great.  It's a fun time to be playing
