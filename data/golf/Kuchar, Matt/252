Q.   The last two years you've made it to the quarterfinals, you've made it to the semifinals.   Tell us how it feels to be in the final. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Really exciting.   This has been a lot of golf, and it's fun to continue to survive.   I don't know if I'm going home, so excited to make the championship match, won five matches now, but it's a thrill.   To have a chance to win the title here at the Accenture Match Play is pretty exciting. 

Q.   Cold and blowing early, what's the most difficult thing about playing in those conditions?
MATT KUCHAR:   This course is a challenge without wind, and I think it's a challenging driving course, approaches with the greens, as much slope as they have, and then putting is difficult.   And pars are really good scores with the conditions the way they are right now.

Q.   You admitted to being a little bit tired yesterday, understandably.   79 holes you've played now.   Is adrenaline enough?
MATT KUCHAR:   Oh, yeah, I think there's plenty of adrenaline to get me through 18 more.

Q.   You're going to be playing Hunter Mahan in the final.   He beat you 6 & 5 last time you played in this championship.   Got it to take him down?
MATT KUCHAR:   Excited to have a chance back at Hunter.   He's a fantastic player, fantastic ball striker.   I know that's certainly going to be helpful in these conditions, being able to control the spin and trajectory of your ball in the wind is an important thing, so it'll be another tough match.   He's proved himself a great player in this format.
