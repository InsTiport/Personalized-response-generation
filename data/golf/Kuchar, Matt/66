 Q.  Your thoughts on the week?  
MATT KUCHAR: It's an amazing year.  Team USA's strongest team I've been a part of.   
 Q.  What does it mean for a guy like Daniel, first Presidents Cup, what do you think it means for him to be able to be the guy to clinch it?  
MATT KUCHAR: That's super cool.  We've got so many rookies that are so good.  A couple of us were talking earlier today that they have such a desire to make Ryder Cup Team; that a team like this, you want to be part of.  It's going to be tough to be part of because it's so deep and so strong.  That goal is going to be a big one for next year to be part of The Ryder Cup squad.
