 Q. Seven birdies, one bogey, 6-under par, great playing. 
 MATT KUCHAR: Thank you. It was a continuation of some good golf last week. I played well last week, had a little bit of a bummer on Sunday, shot +4 on Sunday, but we've been playing well the last week and a half now and hoping to keep going and hoping to keep moving up this FedExCup leaderboard.

 Q. Well, right now you're 60th so you're inside the cut line for next week. You've got to be really pleased with a great opening round here today. 
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, to be at 6-under par, it was a very good opening round. I'm quite happy. Really hoping to just keep moving up. Making the TOUR Championship is a big deal to me. East Lake is a course I play a lot. Atlanta is a hometown for me, so we'd really like to get back there.

 Q. You want a home game, don't you?
 MATT KUCHAR: That's right. It's been on the list of goals for a couple years now, so we're really hoping I'm keep moving forward and make it to Atlanta.
