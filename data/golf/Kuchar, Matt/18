Q. A clean card, what was your mind-set as you made the turn?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it was a great front nine.  It was too bad not to keep that going.  I had a couple chances there early on the back, but some tricky holes.  The wind is from a different angle and I would have liked to have kept the pedal down, but the nature of the game is, hey, sometimes they come early, sometimes they come late, and today they came early.
I'm still pleased.  4-under par is a good day.
Q. You hear players say, I want to be a world player.  What's the value of winning The Scottish Open?  What would it do?
MATT KUCHAR: The Scottish Open is such an historic event, such a great event, to be here on a links golf course.  It's fun to come and test yourself in different parts of the world that play different styles of golf.  Here we play links golf, and it's completely different from what we see in the States.  It's fun to test yourself.
Q. Obviously you're comfortable taking it deep.  Both your wins this season,22-under par.  What's it going to take tomorrow?
MATT KUCHAR: Looks like they are going pretty low.  I'm a ways away, but if I got off to the start I got to today and keep it going, there's still an outside chance.  So hoping to make a bunch of birdies tomorrow.
