  Q. It could have got away from you a little bit at the end, but it didn't. Talk about battling to keep it at 4-under.   
 MATT KUCHAR: I felt solid out there. I didn't feel like I was doing a whole lot of grinding. It felt like a lot of good opportunities. It felt like -- on the front side I happened to find myself with uphill putts for birdie from relatively reasonable lengths, which was fun. You usually hit a good approach shots that end up on the wrong side of the hole and not have much of a birdie attempt. But if you make birdie putts from below the hole, pretty easy putts -- on the back side I didn't feel like I was really ever in trouble of it sliding away. It just was a pretty solid round of golf.  
  
  Q. What happened on 16? Did it just flare out on you, the tee shot?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, between clubs. I went with the one more club, figuring wind was a bit of a guessing game. I tried to hit one with a little less club head speed, a little less spin, and just hit it out to the right. Didn't make my way all the way through it.   
  
  Q. The first putt on 9, a little bit long, the chip on 16 a little bit long, the putt on 17 a little bit long --  
 MATT KUCHAR: The first putt on 9 was short.  
  
  Q. That's right.   
 MATT KUCHAR: But the other ones --  
  
  Q. Is that a little bit of a good sign that nothing was tentative out there? You're aggressive and --  
 MATT KUCHAR: The chip was impossible on 16 to leave short. I felt like I was not at all tentative out there. I felt like the birdie putts I had that were uphill putts, and even a few of the downhill putts, I would go ahead and give some speed to. A few of the uphills were at the back of the hole and just were very, very good putts, and a few of the downhills got away from me, but had uphill five-footers coming back, which I felt very comfortable with.  
  
  Q. So you're in a good spot, first day, 4-under?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Really pleased with where I finished. It's a great spot. Played solid golf. Rory is 7-under; that's fantastic. The conditions were there. It was just still. If ever you could shoot a good score, it would be today. But 7-under is pretty amazing. He's a great player.  
  
  Q. What were the distances on 2? How long was that putt for birdie?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Five feet.  
  
  Q. 4?   
 MATT KUCHAR: 4, nine feet.  
  
  Q. What did you hit into 4?   
 MATT KUCHAR: Hybrid.  
  
  Q. 7?   
 MATT KUCHAR: Ten feet.  
  
  Q. And 8?   
 MATT KUCHAR: Six feet.  
  
  Q. 14?   
 MATT KUCHAR: Ten feet.   
  
  Q. And then you two-putted from about, what, 30 on 15?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, yeah, right around there.   
  
  Q. You were dialed in.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, ten feet and in, and mostly uphill. They were good places to be putting from.  
  
  Q. Well, you've been pretty dialed in pretty much the whole last year. How much is this round kind of feeding off of that and the momentum you've been building?  
 MATT KUCHAR: I think it's just I feel like that's the way my golf game has gone. I felt like I've put in great work with Chris O'Connell and he's made me a better, more consistent player. I feel like I don't have to go to the range and hope I can find it; I feel like I can most of the time know where it is and know where the ball is going. It's a great feeling.  
  
  Q. Are you going to work on anything this afternoon?  
 MATT KUCHAR: No, no, I think take it pretty easy. Yesterday was a full day. I'm looking forward to an easier day today.  
  
  Q. You've got a late tee-off time tomorrow. You've got to feel like a break today will kind of help you catch your breath.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, yesterday was more like what I typically like to do on a Wednesday. I played 18 holes yesterday, and it was a long 18, and then the par-3. I feel like I left the house around 8:00 in the morning and felt like I didn't get back until 6:30 at night. It was a full day on the golf course, which major prep I think most guys try to do a little bit less on Wednesday. But I'm 32 years old; I figured I could handle a couple of long days.
