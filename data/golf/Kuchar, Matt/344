  Q. Just a few comments about the match.   
 MATT KUCHAR: It was a quite a back and forth match. I did not have my game in order today. Fortunately, he gave me a life a number of times I felt like a cat. I had nine lives out there. He missed a lot of opportunities to put me away. I just hung around and made a couple of putts there at the end to kind of survive.   
 I was able to birdie the fourth playoff hole to go to tomorrow. Match play is one of those things where you have to hang in there and you got to hopefully get through your bad day. Hopefully this is my bad day and I can have some good golf from here.
