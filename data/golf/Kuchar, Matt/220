Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   I really like the Presidents Cup.   It's great fun and fun to be part of the team. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   Cool to be back where I won.   This is a special place to me.   I've had a great track record here, had some really good results. 
It's interesting playing these practice rounds where you feel like you know the course well, just kind of getting a feel.   I'm not having to learn.   A lot of these team events I've played have been fresh courses, I've not played.   So really doing a lot of homework.   Most of the homework is done, trying to get a feel out here.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   No, played the front nine and then went 10 through 14 and 18. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   I understand.   I think it's great to have a hole that is more of a driver hole off the tee.   I would like to see a little bit more of the hazards that exist out there.   I think the tee might sit too low or the hillside cut in more than they would like to, or at least what I would like to see.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   You know, it's interesting that we don't really have use of the locker room here.   So it's completely different.   I was looking forward to getting back in the old feel of where we always go for the week, the standard lockers.   So we're in two different places.   So still that locker room feel.   We're all together as a team.   It's fun. 
Last night we had a fun time at the first team dinner.   So it's really fun to be with the guys.   There's a lot of guys on this team that are fun to cut up with and fun to hang out with. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   I hope so.   I hope so.   Yeah, he was really struggling there for a few days.   I think most of us want to keep our safe distance for now.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, yeah, he was going to come up with Davis and I yesterday, but wasn't able to.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   No, I think Jason Dufner is the funniest guy.

Q.   Why? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Why?   I don't know.   How do you explain funny?   You are either funny or not.   It's a tough one to explain.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   I think it's maybe the unexpected.   I think you are so used to Dufner not really giving you much when he is out on the golf course.   You are used to just a straight face, not get excited, not getting down.   When he starts saying some things that are funny, it catches you off guard and strikes you as being, man, this guy as got a lot more than you think he does.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   Again, that's one of those things.   I don't know how to rate or how to be funny.   I certainly enjoy getting to be part of these team events.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   I've not played at all yet.   I've not played yet.   I'm trying to build up the confidence this year.   The last couple of years, I think I've really hurt the confidence of some guys.   I want to kind of steer clear.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   That's really a tough one.   I think some of the most fun is having the team bond.   You just don't get that but once a year.   I know the atmosphere of the crowds will be great.   The first tee will be awesome.   I look forward to that. 
We do get to play a handful of tournaments where you get great atmosphere.   You don't get the team bond or the U.S.A. bond.   Putting on these shirts with the U.S.A. logo is really a cool thing. 
But being around the guys, getting to hang out with wives as well and getting to know the second half or other half of players is fun.   It's not something that we get to do much of during the year.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   Surprisingly similar.   I had the understanding that things would get a lot dryer almost to the dormant time of year where it wouldn't be much rough.   Still some rough out on the course.   It's green.   It's playing great.   It's firm.   It really has a similar feel.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   I played with Tiger and Davis and Dufner today.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   I get a feeling that Tiger and I will probably play together this week, which I look forward to.   I get along very well with Tiger.   Certainly I think if you could pick a partner, picking the No. 1 player in the world is a good partner to have.   So he's got a great track record around this place as well. 
I don't know that I would pick his brain too much on how to play the course.   I feel like I know very well myself how to play.   But certainly having him there to count on and rely on, you have got the best player in the world on your back to play with.   He's a great partner to have.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   I haven't heard.   It's funny, I've really‑‑ I haven't heard anything. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   It was really cool for me to follow great players like Stricker and Tiger and be this year's champion here.   It meant a lot to me.   I think this tournament attracts some really great champions.   For me to win here was awesome. 
This team is pretty impressive, the record here at Murfield village.   It certainly shows up well on paper for us.   I kind of think you throw most of that out the window when Thursday rolls around and competition begins.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   Very similar.   Surprised.   I thought it would be a little bit more on the dormant side.   I know in June it's really lush.   They get some good rain and normally it tends to be on the soft side.   It's still very green out here.   It's firm, but I kind of think in June they have got conditions so good the greens if there is not a lot of rain the greens get really firm and fast up here.   They may not be quite up to speed of Memorial time of year, but I imagine they can get them there by Thursday or Friday.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
MATT KUCHAR:   No, no.   I have got some certainly good friends and good relationships over there.   We play a lot.   Most of those guys are on the U.S. PGA Tour, so I see a lot of those guys and have developed some good relationships.   I'm friends with most of them and I think it will be a great, fun competition.
