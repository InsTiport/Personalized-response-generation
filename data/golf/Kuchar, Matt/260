 Q.   Just some comments on the match so far and how you're feeling heading into the afternoon.   
MATT KUCHAR:   I feel really good.   Got off to a great start, birdied 1, 3, 4, and kept things going really well, put the pressure on.   I tried not to give any holes away.   Excited about the way I'm playing and looking forward to this afternoon.
