Q.   Almost a great defense of your title.   You really played well today.   Your thoughts on how this day went as you tried to chase down Jim?
MATT KUCHAR:   I did.   It was going really well.   I think it got there close.   I kept hearing Jim make putts, and get cheers.   And I think I birdied 12, it might have even been‑‑ 12 and 13.   And knew I was close.   I think within one. 
14 is really hard.   I had less than a great shot there left.   I was just oversafe and made bogey.   Okay, still needed to make a run. 
I lipped out putts on 15. 
Made a poor decision on 16, looking back on things.   I thought I could drive it past the tree and have a great angle in.   And it caught the tree and ended up not the smartest decision. 
Bogey on 15 was deflating, but great putts, good shots on 17 and 18.   Played good golf.   Impressive what Jim did today.   Looks like Kisner followed it up with a great round, himself.

Q.   Thoughts where you go from here.   A busy schedule, Match Play in a few weeks, the PLAYERS.   What's your schedule like the next month or so?
MATT KUCHAR:   It is exciting.   A couple of big ones.   Match Play and PLAYERS, those would be my next two.   Looking forward to them.   I've never played Harding Park, so I'm excited to go out there.   Always enjoy THE PLAYERS Championship.   Such a great event they do there.   It truly is like a major championship, and I think everybody gets pretty pumped up to play THE PLAYERS.

Q.   Not sure if you're aware of this, you were within one shot of the lead of Jim on 13.   How would you best describe your play coming in?
MATT KUCHAR:   It was really good.   I think it was 12 and 13 made birdies, got to within one.   I was looking up and seeing Furyk just continued to make putts and people cheering.   I was going, would he just slow down a little bit.   I got it going with birdies on 12 and 13.   14 I just bailed out left.   It is such a scary par‑3.   You've got to pull off a great shot.   If you don't, you're looking at making bogey, and I did it and I made bogey there.   It was okay.
And then the other bummer on 16, just a bad decision off the tee.   I was trying to be aggressive.   I thought I could get past the tree with a great angle in, behind the tree, hit the tree and I ended up making a great bogey. 
I made great, great efforts.   Lipped out a putt on 15.   Lipped out on 17 and 18, and was really playing good golf, hitting good putts, and I'll look back on those two bogeys.   But it was just one bad swing, really.

Q.   As you leave here, a lot of stuff that you could build on.   If so, what is it? 
MATT KUCHAR:   I played really good golf.   I certainly played good golf on Sunday.   Awfully pleased.   We had a couple of guys play great, Jim Furyk and what Kevin Kisner did today, really good golf.   I thought I was going pretty well, and just happened to have a couple of struggles at the end.
