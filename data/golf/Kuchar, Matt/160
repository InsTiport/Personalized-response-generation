 Q.   Assess the round, you know, what your ‑‑  
MATT KUCHAR:   I wasn't hitting it great today, but kept it in play for the most part and had chances and then it was great to birdie 17.   
I came close on 15 and 16 and then birdied 17, I thought I had a good chance on 18.   
A bummer not to make the one on 18.   I had a tough lie from the fairway, hit a decent shot, missed the green, figured that's an easy place to get up‑and‑down; and I think it was a little into the grain, chip came up short and had a good putt and it slid by the edge.   
It was pretty disappointing to be that close and not at least birdie the 18th to make Bill try to make birdie to win.  
   
 Q.   Did you think you hit the right putt there?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I hit a good putt.   Hit a good putt.   Sure did.  
   
 Q.   5‑under, obviously under normal circumstances that's a solid closing round.   This is a special circumstance playing this course.   Did you have a certain number in mind?  
MATT KUCHAR:   No, never, I never have a number.   But, yeah, 5‑under's a nice round.   I didn't take advantage of either par‑5s on the back side, so that certainly left a couple out there.  
   
 Q.   When you look back at the round is that your initial thoughts, just not taking advantage of those par‑5s?   You had the one eagle and then pars on other 5's.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, so, yeah, looking back, I had chances there, hit some good putts on, must have been ‑‑ I can't remember the holes.   14, 16.   16 was a really good putt.   
18, again, really good putt.   
But the regret is not getting up‑and‑down from pin high on 18.   That was a tough one.   My short game was really good all week, chipping really well, and I left myself a 10‑footer and I should have had a kick‑in from there.  
   
 Q.   Is that what kind of let you down today, the putting, the short game?  
MATT KUCHAR:   No, no, just the chip there on 18.   That's the only thing that let me down.   
   
 Q.   How do you assess your form right now early in the season here?  
MATT KUCHAR:   Pretty pleased.
