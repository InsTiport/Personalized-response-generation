MATT KUCHAR:  It was another good one.  I was awfully happy with today's round.  Unfortunately I finished on a sour note.  I bogeyed 16 and doubled 18.  But still a lot of good things going on.  I made some good putts today.  I kind of continued the hot putter and keeping the ball in the fairway.  Until 16 and 18, things were going pretty well.
Q.  Are you surprised no one has really jumped down?  The leaderboard is really hanging with people within range.
MATT KUCHAR:  I haven't paid too much attention to the leaderboard, who is making moves or not.  But this course is awfully difficult.  The greens I think especially are tough to really make birdies on.  They're so firm it's hard to stick shots close.  You have to be so cautious on birdie attempts.  The putts can really get away from you.  I remember my first bogey came on the third hole, par-3.  I had just a beautiful tee shot.  It landed just on the front edge of the green and went probably 15, 20 feet beyond the pin.  I felt like I just tapped my putt and I see it sliding a little break, I didn't quite notice, and it goes six, seven feet by the hole.

It's things like that where you kind of get scared the rest of the day.  You're thinking, my gosh, these things kind of don't really stop.

So it's hard to see how Adam Scott shot 7-under on the first day.  And I guess Craig Parry had quite the day at 8-under.  Those are just amazing rounds of golf.  But I don't see a whole lot of that out here.
Q.  To be in contention now with 18 to go, how does it feel?
MATT KUCHAR:  It feels great.  It's awfully nice to be around on the weekend.  For me it's kind of a lot of Saturdays and Sundays off, so this is a lot of fun to play on the weekends.

To play here on the Stadium Course in front of your hometown is great.  Of course, to be playing later on in the afternoon is a thrill.
