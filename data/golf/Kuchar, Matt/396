  Q. Nobody ever likes to finish with a bogey, but you're 4-under and you're right in there.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it's a shame to finish with a bogey. I just missed the tee shot on nine and it hung out just a little to the right and you get in the rough there and it's a chip out, so that's what I had to do. I took a bogey. But all in all even par is a pretty good score today.  
  
  Q. What do you think about this wind for the afternoon?  
 MATT KUCHAR: I'm glad I'll be sitting in my hotel room.   
 (Laughter.)  
 You get -- the breaks are 50/50. You just got to stay patient and then if you get bad tee times maybe next week you get a good tee time. It looks like I got good tee times this week.  
  
  Q. What's been working for you this week?  
 MATT KUCHAR: This week just staying out of trouble. I haven't had to pitch out but a tame or two. So I've been pretty lucky hitting a lot of greens, a lot of fairways. And then just making easy pars out there. It's not the most glorious thing to do, but easy pars are a good thing to have out here.  
  
  Q. Well, continue good play.   
 MATT KUCHAR: All right. Thanks a lot.
