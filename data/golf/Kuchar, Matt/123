MATT KUCHAR: Another good round.  I've got a great track record here.  This tournament has to be my best track record of all the tournaments I play through the years.  Seem to come through with nice finishes, seem to put together a lot of good rounds.  Today was another one.   
Didn't realize I was bogey-free today, but ended up bogey-free.  I know I came close to making a bogey on 18.  It was nice to see a 15-footer drop in on the last to stay bogey-free and shoot 6 under today.   
 Q.  Never easy conditions, but benign today?  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, this is as benign as we get.  The wind was blowing at 5 miles per hour tops today.  It was a quite benign today.  This place, with the greens as fast as they are, you don't want to be on the wrong side.  Pretty easy to get on the wrong side around here.   
 Q.  Does this test the whole game?  Guys at the top are long hitters, and guys who are great putters, great champions.  Seems like it really tests it all.  
MATT KUCHAR: You get a lot of great champions here and the different styles.   
Last year having Justin Rose and David Lingmerth duking it out, completely different guys that play.  And you've got guys at the Champion Wall of Fame, like Steve Stricker, and you've got guys who really hit it far as well.  I think it's a fantastic test of golf because there's so much different ways to play it.
