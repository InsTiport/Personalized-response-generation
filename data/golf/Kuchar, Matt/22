Q. How would you describe that round, started off pretty good?
MATT KUCHAR: It did.  It's U.S. Open, I had a little blip on the 10th hole with a double bogey.  You do your best at U.S. Opens to avoid those.  It's tough to go a tournament without getting one.  I'm hoping I got one out of the way.
But there was a lot of good golf, and an awesome way to finish.  Hit two great shots just over the back of the green, and an amazing chip to see it fall in the hole was just a fantastic finish.
Q. What kind of momentum does that give you going into tomorrow?
MATT KUCHAR: I had a great putt for birdie on 9 yesterday.  It's a great way to leave the course.  A couple of different ways you can leave.  I can't think of a much better way to leave the course than holing out on 18 for eagle.
Q. The back nine started with a double bogey, ended it with an eagle?
MATT KUCHAR: If you play enough, you tend to make up for things.  The breaks you get tend to even out.
Q. What happened on 10?
MATT KUCHAR: Left rough, bad lie.  Wasn't able to cover the bunkers, just trying to advance, was trying to get it out of the rough and over the bunkers for a wedge in.  Couldn't get it over the bunkers from there.  Actually rolled down the hazard and was able to chip on the green and two-putt for double.
Q. What club did you hit into 18?
MATT KUCHAR: 3-hybrid.
Q. How are you feeling about your position going into Saturday?
MATT KUCHAR: I really don't worry.  You do the best you can.  I feel like I've had two good days and hope for two more good days.
