 Q.   Solid round of golf today, 8-under par 64 and I hate to say, it looked like you left quite a few out there, but it was pretty simple out, there you played solid?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I played some good golf out there.   Kind of a bummer, 8 and 9 are really opportunities to score and I played par on both of them with just a sand wedge in my hand.   Hard to be bummed with 64, but all in all game's in good shape, feeling good.   
Yesterday was rusty, today was sharp, and I'm hoping to continue the sharpness for the final two days.  
   
 Q.   You got the hard course out of the way, you still shot a couple under par, but the big thing that I think is such an advantage out there is to play over there and get it out of the way and then you stay on the same grasses here for the last three.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, nice.   We got the Palmer rotation for the last two days, it's good to have back to back days over this grass and really get comfy and consistent, hopefully have a good score tomorrow and lead into a chance to win on Sunday.   
   
 Q.   This is a funny question, but is there a golf course that you can't play well on?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I hope not.   I try to build a game that can play well week in and week out.   One of those things that I pride myself on is playing some good golf with some consistency.   
I didn't want to be a guy that played well four or five times a year.   It's nice to be able to play well week in and week out and makes my life a lot more easier than the stress of having to hope to play well certain weeks.   
   
 Q.   Good drives, wedges from the fairway and good putter adds up to pretty low scores.   Great playing.   
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, thanks.
