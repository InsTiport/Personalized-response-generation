 Q.   Now 21 victories in The Presidents Cup, more than any player who has competed in this competition on either side.   
TIGER WOODS:   We ham‑and‑egged it pretty good.   Cuff are Kuch made a bunch of putts on the front nine, I got it rolling there for a little bit and on the back nine, it was him or me on each hole.   We did pretty good.   
   
 Q.   How were you guys able to come up with the idea to do that funky high five you guys were doing throughout the day?   
MATT KUCHAR:   That was definitely all me.   That stems from the Fresh Prince of Bel‑Air.   I figured this guy was the perfect Carlton.   
TIGER WOODS:   Thank you very much.   
MATT KUCHAR:   We had some fun out there.   We had a lot of fun out there in practice rounds, we dominated Stricker and juror damage Spieth today and we figured we would try to keep that momentum going and play some great golf.   It's awfully fun partnering up with the No. 1 player in the world.   
   
 Q.   Eight birdies, you guys earned this one, it wasn't given to you?  
TIGER WOODS:   Well, it was kind of neat, because it was one or the other.   Kuch made some nice birdies early.   I made a little run there in the middle part of the round and then the back nine, it was one or the other, taking over the holes.   
   
 Q.   A little easier to make it when you're making the longer putt and the other guy is in there and you have an opportunity if you do miss.   
MATT KUCHAR:   It's awesome partnering up with the No. 1 player in the world, he was strong and had a really strong stretch there, six, seven, eight, and then I birdied 9 and it was just really, really nice team work today.  
   
 Q.   You leading off the tee, that was interesting to see you lead off.   
TIGER WOODS:   We did it yesterday.   As Kuch said, we absolutely dominated Stricks and Jordan yesterday.   We played 12 holes and we were 9‑under, so we kept the same batting order.   
   
 Q.   Just talk about the round, first time you've played with Matt in team competition but you obviously have good chemistry.   
TIGER WOODS:   We've been good friends for a long time.   We went out there, had a great time today and put it on them.   
   
 Q.   You've had a lot of different partners over the years.   What makes a good partnership for you?   
TIGER WOODS:   We both play well at the same time, and we did that today.   Kuch was solid all day.   When he made a mistake, I was there; and when I made a few mistakes, he was there, and we were just never really out of a hole.   
   
 Q.   Having won at this course a hundred times, does it help your confidence‑‑  
TIGER WOODS:   Both of us, we both have the low stroke averages in this tournament's history.   Put us together and we feel very comfortable how to play this golf course.
