Q.   68 for Matt Kuchar, a slow start in this third round.   How pleased are you with the finish a couple of birdies late and then a great par save at the last?
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, it was nice to get a few birdies coming in.   Pretty amazing to do three straight rounds of 68, but looks like I'm going to go a lot deeper than that tomorrow to catch these guys.   There's a lot of guys sitting at that tied number.   It's exciting to be at my homeâ€‘town event having a chance.   Sitting three shots back at the moment, but I'm pretty pleased with where I stand and looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   Conditions are supposed to be similar tomorrow.   How aggressive can you get on this golf course when you have ground to make up?
MATT KUCHAR:   It's funny.   I was out here practicing a little last week and all the locals were really hoping for a lot of wind.   They really wanted to see us struggle and suffer, and I was going, man, this place is hard without wind.
The conditions today were perfect.   I think the players enjoy this sort of challenge.   If it's like this tomorrow, you're really going to have to play some good golf.   It's challenging, but you can still make some birdies out there.

Q.   We've been talking on the broadcast about the countdown to Rio and the Olympics and the return to golf.   What is your thought on it?   How much on the radar is it for you to be part of that and call yourself a U. S. Olympian?
MATT KUCHAR:   Still a long way away.   For me two years is a long ways.   There's a lot more things to focus on before that, but it's an exciting opportunity for all of us.   I think anybody that's into sports wants to participate in the Olympics, and to have that opportunity, to have that chance is certainly, at least on my radar and something I'm really hoping to qualify for.

Q.   Matt, appreciate the time as always.   We'll see you on Sunday.
