MATT KUCHAR: Decent position. It was a very, very hard day. Bummer on the last to 3‑putt, but I took the wrong strategy there on the putt. That and 15 were tough breaks. 15, I thought I hit a bunch of real good shots and walked away with a bogey, which it's part of how it works here, there's a fine line between birdies and bogeys. It's one of those days where I'm kind of anxious to kick my feet up in the house and watch the guys deal with it the rest of the afternoon.

Q. The shots on 4 and 12, did the wind kind of, did you guess a certain way on the wind and it didn't work out that way? Because both of them ‑‑
MATT KUCHAR: Neither one were great shots. No, I don't want to say I was wrong on the wind. Bad shots.

Q. What was the one on 16? Did that just carry a little extra than you thought?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I think I had 233 to the back edge and, adjusted with the downhill, and my hybrid that I hit carries about 228 and I figured, gosh, anything less than that is perfect and it seemed to carry all the way to 233 and then from that far over the green it's just, you are looking for your best place to hit your fourth shot from. You're not even looking at trying to get on the green, you're just ‑‑ your third one is strictly a position shot to try to figure out where you think you can get up‑and‑down from. It's not even looking to get it on the green with your third from where I hit it. So it was tough because I thought I actually played a good third and a good fourth and a good fifth and I tapped in for six. That's part of how this course operates, it's just, it's a very, very fine line between birdies and bogeys here. 

Q. The speculation about that 13th hole, whether they're going to extend it, move the tee box back. 
MATT KUCHAR: I got the same idea as you. I don't know, I don't speculate. 

Q. How comfortable did you feel out there today?
MATT KUCHAR: It's tough from the get‑go. It was never comfortable. I think this place keeps you on edge because of the fact that on almost every shot that line between birdie and bogey is so fine. You either have to be sharp or you really have to be clean and with these conditions, if you're not sharp I felt like I was doing a whole lot of scrambling and for the most part I was getting away with scrambling pretty well today. 

Q. How was the wind today?
MATT KUCHAR: Very, very tough.

Q. Do you think, when all is said and done, the guys that are in contention on the lead on Sunday will have had to overcome a 73, 74 type round earlier? Do you think everybody's going to have a day like this and it's just a matter of bouncing back?
MATT KUCHAR: Not sure what the next couple days are going to be. I could see a guy stringing together two nice rounds. Rickie put together two nice rounds. I certainly could see Thursday, Friday putting together par or better rounds. They say rain tomorrow, not sure what Sunday looks like. I don't know that everybody's going to have to take a 73 or 74. 

Q. You probably answered this three times this week, so forgive me, but kind of memories from 20 years ago, is it hard to believe it was 20 years ago when you became the young amateur star?
MATT KUCHAR: It is hard to believe it. Certainly yesterday we played late in the afternoon, our group was playing great, and walking up 18 the shadows were long, I was really enjoying the day. But I thought back to walking up 18 with my dad on the bag and you remember, each day, kind of going, how special is this? Just trying to soak it in. Trying to realize what a special place that we are, getting to be inside the ropes, getting to compete. And then kind of felt that yesterday, just as the shadows were long and late in the afternoon, so I thought back to '98 and walking up with dad on 18. 

Q. Is it a little hard to believe it was 20 years ago or does it feel like 15 minutes ago?
MATT KUCHAR: It is very, very hard to believe. It's amazing how fast time goes. To think that I'm nearing 40, to think I got a 10 year old and an 8 year old, it's hard to believe how quickly it goes. But what great memories I made and particularly at this place.
