Q.
Well, let's hear it.
MATT KUCHAR:  Nobody saw it.  I think we all figured that everybody off of the green was shrugging their shoulders saying it just disappeared.  They didn't erupt because it flew straight in the hole.  It was awesome.  That's why they heard it rattle the pin, everybody was just giving it one of these, "What happened?"  We went up there kind of guessing.  Nobody saw it, nobody knew where it went, and we kind of knew it went straight in the hole.  It was awesome, my first one in official competition.
Q.  No one hopper or anything, huh?
MATT KUCHAR:  No, just disappeared straight in, like a slam dunk.
Q.  We heard it messed up the cup a little bit.  They had to do some work on the hole?
MATT KUCHAR:  Yeah, we were actually kind of falling behind and about to be on the clock, and all of a sudden I thought I was speeding up play and ended up having to bring the official out to fix the cup and ended up slowing down play a little bit.  It flew straight in but kind of dented the side of the cup a little bit.
Q.  You had a heck of a round today.
MATT KUCHAR:  It was great front side, shot 5 under on the front with the help of that hole in one on 7, but the back side all week I didn't play nearly as well.  The front side I seemed to be a bunch under and the back side kind of went that same way today, was 2 over on the back unfortunately.  But pretty happy with the week.
