Q.   Good play by the entire group today.   Talk about your 5‑under today. 
MATT KUCHAR:   I played some good golf.   Obviously some of the other guys shooting 7‑unders today.   A lot of birdies were had.   A lot of good shots out there.   It was a fun group to be a part of this round.

Q.   You had 11 one‑putt greens, including on six on what was your back nine, the front.   Obviously the flat stick was pretty good today. 
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, I was doing a lot of things well.   I wasn't in a whole lot of trouble.   I was looking to make birdies on almost every hole.   I think I had my lone bogey today happened to be a three‑putt.   I got a little aggressive with the first putt, I figured I'm rolling it good, let's try to make a birdie, then just had one slide by the edge for par.   Other than that, it was a really solid day.

Q.   Talk about the conditions.   How do they compare to what you guys had to deal with yesterday afternoon?
MATT KUCHAR:   Similar.   The wind was up.   I expected it to be a little more calm this morning, but enough wind to make the course just enough challenging.   My group seemed to handle it pretty well.

Q.   Still receptive greens? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, greens are soft.   If you're driving it well, if you put it in the fairways, you can have some short irons in.   It's a good mix of holes because there are a handful of short holes that you want to take advantage of, then there are a handful of holes where you just hope to survive.
