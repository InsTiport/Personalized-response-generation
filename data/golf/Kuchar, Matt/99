MATT KUCHAR: This was the year we got paired together.  The deal was to have fun and we're going to play well if we're having fun out there.  It was awesome, it was so much fun playing with him.  To watch him down the stretch hit great shot after great shot, it was a thrill for me to be a part of.   
 Q.  Your length, your distance has been impeccable today, you go and make it, was this long-range shimmy, shimmy plan, was that orchestrated a little?  
PHIL MICKELSON: You can't orchestrate something like that.  It kind of comes out.   
MATT KUCHAR: It's just natural.  It's just what the body does when you are dropping a long range bomb.   
PHIL MICKELSON: You watch Steph Curry do it, I think we stepped it up another notch.   
 Q.  Those birdies you made at 14 and 15, I mean, that was just some great golf out there.  That wedge shot that you hit at 15, we've got 15,000 of your closest friends watching you hit a wedge with a backstop back there.  This should be fun.  
PHIL MICKELSON: I was going to take it back too far, so I took a little bit more club so I could bring it in dead or flatter and not spin it.  But I still wanted that uphill putt.  I put it in the right spot.   
Martin, I have got to give him a lot of credit because he had to make that 15-footer that he made to extend the match.  He made a great birdie there.  Then they birdied 16 to keep extending it.   
 Q.  At 17, with Sergio hitting such a great shot in there, did that free you up to go hole hunting?  
MATT KUCHAR: We knew we were going to have to birdie one of incoming holes to finish the match off.  They were playing some really good golf.  Sergio got started on 17.  Phil stepped up and stuffed it in there.  It was nice to have two chances.  I think that was the goal to always have two chances.  My big brother was there to back me up today.   
PHIL MICKELSON: I had a blast with Matt.  I had wanted to play with him for such a long time, but he's so easy to pair with all the guys on the team that if we have an odd pairing, we just put Matt with them.   
We've never really had a chance to partner.  When the opportunity arose, I was so excited.  It was just what I needed to get me relaxed, to get me laughing, to get me enjoying the golf.  In my back nine he brought out my best.   
He is kind of that chameleon that we never had a chance to play.  When the opportunity arose today, I was so excited because I knew this was something we would have loved to done for many years now, and now we get to do it in the greatest pressure situation.  And he brings out the best in me by being so funny and light hearted, telling stories, cracking jokes.  It gets me in a good positive flow and it brought out the best golf.  So appreciative to have been able to play with him.   
 Q.  Matt, how do you balance the atmosphere but stay focused on getting the job done?  
MATT KUCHAR: When you play golf, you have got to enjoy what you are doing.  We had a great time, enjoying each other's company.
