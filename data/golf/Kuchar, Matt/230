Q.   Matt, can you describe what happened today?   Have you ever seen a golf course change so dramatically from one day to the next with the conditions? 
MATT KUCHAR:   The course was fantastic today.   It's in great shape.   This is the best day we've had.   The course was just looking really good.   The wind picked up.   Was one of the few times I've struggled to really read the wind.   Played some good golf, but wasn't quite sharp enough to do much with it.   Just a handful of shots that were just off, and paid the price for it.

Q.   Where do you see yourself at this point, 75, you're 2â€‘under, seven shots behind Furyk I think at this point?
MATT KUCHAR:   Exactly what you just said. 

Q.   What do you think it's going to take to win tomorrow?   Do you have to shoot a specific score, do you think? 
MATT KUCHAR:   I don't really know.   I don't really know.   I don't have a good answer for that. 

Q.   Do the best you can? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Do the best I can.
