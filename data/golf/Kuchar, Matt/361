 Q. Obviously you're not feeling so hot right now. You're still leading the tournament. Kind of talk a little bit about your round and what might have clicked out there. 
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, just keep playing. I was driving it well. I was actually doing everything well. It felt very good. Last week was a little bit suspect, and this week I kind of figured some stuff out, hitting the ball solid and making some putts. 
 Yeah, I've got good memories of this place, so it continued to go well for me today.
