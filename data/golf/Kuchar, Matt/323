  Q. When you finally did get going, seemed like you played pretty well.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I did. Played pretty steady. Putted well and the conditions were soft. I think when you find soft conditions, guys are going to find ways to shoot low numbers, and that's what I did today.   
  
  Q. Let's talk about coming back, quick turnaround now; come back out tomorrow morning and go right back on the golf course.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Not my favorite thing to do. Playing really well. Coming into this week I had a nice, relaxing off week and got some good golf in at the end of the week and was playing well and excited for The Barclays to come around.   
  
  Q. Conditions will still be soft tomorrow, so expect more low scores again?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I think right now who knows what's going to happen with the completion of this tournament, so you kind of want to keep going as low as you can as quickly as you can.  
  
  Q. You get the lead, you never know, you might win.   
 MATT KUCHAR: That's right.  
  
  Q. The end of the round, you had I think a bogey but you came back with two birdies. How much momentum does that give you going to tomorrow?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Nice to finish the way I did. Nice to finish with a couple of birdies. It's never fun to finish a round with a bogey, but I made a couple of good putts for birdies on 15 and 16 and I have a couple of chances to make a few more birdies before we restart round two.
