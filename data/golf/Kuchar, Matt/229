 Q.   5‑under, 66 today.   You finished at 17 under, obviously not the shortest day on the golf course.   Great round, a couple of comments on the round and the week overall?  
MATT KUCHAR:   It was a good scoring week for me.   I was playing really well last week and had a bad Sunday, so was glad to come back this week and play some good golf, see the ball go in the hole and have a nice finish.  
I was bummed with Saturday.   I didn't play good enough‑‑ sorry, Sunday, third round, to even be in contention.   But nice round today.   Put me up there with a nice finish.  
I feel like it was just steady golf.   Not a whole lot of exciting things going on.   I scored pretty well this week.  
   
 Q.   Chicago in a little over a week?  
MATT KUCHAR:   I always want to be higher, I always want to be in better form.   I think the position to be is No.1.   But I think I'll stay in the top five.   And hopefully stay inside the top five come TOUR Championship and have a chance to win the FedExCup.
