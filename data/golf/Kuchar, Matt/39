Q. What was excelling in your match today?
MATT KUCHAR: I got off to a 1-down start through one again, which is not a great place to be.  But I knew I was playing good golf.  With 17 holes, there's a lot of time to make it up.  And just continued playing some good golf and Si Woo gave me a couple coming in.  Nice to be done early and go watch opening day baseball, and maybe some basketball tonight, as well.
Q. Talk about today.  You dropped the first hole and then you take off from there, don't you?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah.  Certainly not the plan.  But after losing the first, you know you've got 17 holes to make it up, there's a lot of golf yet.  I knew I was playing good golf yesterday, I was on good form today again, good form.  Tricky in these conditions.  Par is a lot of time is a good score around here.  Greens are tricky and approaches are really tough with this much wind.
Q. 26 all-time wins in this format in the Dell Technologies Match Play, that's right up there among the best.  Pretty awesome stuff, man?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, thank you.  I very much enjoy the week.  My wife always says it's one of her favorites.  She comes from a tennis background and the match play format, she loves it.  So thankfully I've done well and I also enjoy it very much.
Q. Now you have baseball and the NCAA Sweet 16 to watch.  That will be kind of fun to tonight.
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, opening day baseball, I'm anxious, every team has a chance, everybody is excited about their team doing well.  And then tonight should be some good basketball.  I think everyone is excited about the Sweet 16 to kick off.
