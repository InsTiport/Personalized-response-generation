 JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Thank you, Matt, for joining us for a few minutes.  Good round today.  With one little blemish at the end of the day.  Why don't you make a couple of comments about the course and maybe the conditions and then how you played and then we will go into questions.
MATT KUCHAR:  I was glad to see the 7:45 or is it 7:42 tee time this morning.  Those are always nice when you have weather like this.  This feels like where I grew up back in Orlando.  And just hot and humid.  And you know if you could play some time before 8 o'clock, you're going to beat a lot of the really bad heat.  And so that was awfully nice to play this morning.  The conditions were good.
The course has been quite acceptable to shots and low scores.  The greens putt very well.  They're, it's nice to get on some bentgreens.  That feels a little bit like my second home in Atlanta.  And these greens are a speed where you don't have to be very scared of putts.  You can be aggressive almost every where.  So it's -- it feels like you really have a chance of making all your putts.  The tough thing is occasionally in the rough you can get a really bad lie.  The rough, you can also get good lies.  On 18, I was in one of those occasional bad spots where the rough is quite deep.  And it almost felt like the U.S. Open where I just had to bring out a sandwedge and hack it back out to the fairway.  So you do have to drive it pretty well.  That's kind of the fun thing about this course, it's not necessarily just a really a long hitter's course, you have to be in the proper side of a few fairways.  So you put yourself in the right position and that's important out here. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Questions?
Q.  Go over your birdies, please. 
MATT KUCHAR:  My first birdie came on the fifth hole, the par-5.  I just got up-and-down from short of the green.  I hit a good drive there.  That's one of those holes where you have to drive it on the correct side of the fairway and that instance it's kind of the left side of the fairway you have to be.  If you're in the right side of the fairway, you're blocked out by one of the large trees there.  So I hit a good drive and I had I think 220 to the hole.  Hit a 3-iron just short of the green and got up-and-down. 
I birdied 7, it looks like.  I have no idea what 7 is.  Okay, I birdied 7.  That's another one where a drive is important.  If you drive it on the right side of the fairway, I did that in the practice round.  I was still in the fairway and had real no shot to the green.  So I hit a good drive there, up the left side of the fairway.  And a 7-iron from, I think, 160 yards.  Hit that to about 15 feet.  And made the putt there. 
And then number 9, I hit a 3-wood off the tee, then a 7-iron from, I think, it was 170 yards.  I had that there.  It was a little bit down wind.  Hit 7-iron to just the back edge of the green but the pin was all the way back.  It was only about a 10- foot putt that I had, and made that.  That was a nice way to kind of start my tournament, shooting 3-under on the front.  It had been a little bit of a long stretch with me with missed cuts my last three events, and so to come out and to get a few under-par early is -- it was tough the last couple rounds I played where I would make a bogey before I would make a birdie and then it seemed like I was battling the entire way.  So it was nice to get a couple under- par early. 
I then birdied 13.  Okay.  That one I hit a 3-wood off the tee.  It was another 7-iron.  From 160 yards I had hit that to probably 15 feet behind the hole.  That was, I was pretty happy with that shot.  The wind was into us and there's a little creek short and right of the hole, and I was just pretty glad to hit a good smart shot there to the center of the green and left myself a 15-foot putt and made the putt. 
Birdied 15.  Well, 15 is the one I just told you about.  13, I can't remember for anything.  I don't know what happened on 13.  I made birdie though.  It looks like.  15, just pretend that's what I said for 15.  We will go on to 16.  Hit an average drive out to the right side of the fairway and hit a great 3-wood.  That went on the right side of the green.  Pin was all the way left.  And it was -- I was able to just 2-putt from there for birdie.  And then bogey, oh, I had to end my bogey-free round with a bogey on 18 unfortunately.  I drove it in the right rough.  Had a terrible lie.  Had to just hack out with a sand wedge.  And then hit it to about 10 feet and lipped out.  It was too bad.  It would have been nice to have made that putt.  I was, I think I was really putting well.  And that's always fun.  Regardless of how you hit it, when you putt well you end up playing pretty well.  And it helped today.  I felt like I was hitting it pretty well.  So it was fun having a round like this today. 

Q.  When you hit 10 feet on 18 what club did you use?
MATT KUCHAR: Sand wedge.  From 103 yards I had. 

Q.  Did your expectations of yourself change after you won at Honda?  Did you expect more from yourself?
MATT KUCHAR: I think -- I don't think I expected more.  I just got side tracked maybe.  I think I had accomplished all the goals I had planned for this year.  I had wanted to keep my card was the main goal.  I thought it would be nice to win at some point in my career and go ahead and knock that out.  I wasn't quite sure what I wanted from there.  And I enjoyed life for a little while.  Realized that I needed to get back to work.  And I think that the game of golf you have, you go in cycles, everybody's going to have highs and lows and throughout history I think if you look, most guys that have something good happen, win tournaments or something, tend to struggle to follow it up.  And I think I fell into that category.  I kind of think it happened, because I felt like I had experienced that before in college.  I had won the Amateur, done well in the Masters and the U.S. Open.  And then my junior year I struggled a bit.  I think I got caught up doing so many other things besides practicing that my game suffered and it was a similar little fall.  I think this one I've, I realized it a little quicker than I did back in my junior year at Georgia Tech.  But now I feel like I've gotten back on track, set another new goal for myself and ready to keep going. 

Q.  What's your new goal?
MATT KUCHAR:  New goal, I would like to play in the Tour Championship.  That's my new goal. 
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Any more questions.
MATT KUCHAR: All right.  Thank you, guys.
