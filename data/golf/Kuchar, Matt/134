Q. You got finished just in time, posting a 67 out there.  As you finished your round how were conditions out there?
MATT KUCHAR: All day, all day it wasn't necessarily easy or hard at any point.  It's not like -- it was blowing a constant 20 miles an hour all day.  You had some holes that you could take advantage of, some tough holes.  It's a good blend of golf course strategy as far as difficult, easy holes.  Amazing what Jason Day has done.  There's a lot of dispersion in the scores.  You see some high scores and then pretty amazing to see 9-under.  The course is unbelievable.
Q. What challenges did that wind out there pose for you today?
MATT KUCHAR: It just depended which way you were going.  A handful of holes played really hard into the wind.  You had a number of crosswinds which aren't much easier.  It makes it a test.  Even reading the greens, putting with 20 mile-an-hour winds is testy, particularly these greens.  They're running pretty fast.  It can get testy on the greens, as well.
Q. Made the turn at even par, 4-under par on the back nine.  What was the key for you on the back?
MATT KUCHAR: I think the back side has got more chances.  I think the back side has definitely got a few more birdie opportunities, but I hit a couple close shots, made all the chances I had inside 10 feet.  Nice to finish strong out there.
