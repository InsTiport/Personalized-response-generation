Q. Matt Kuchar just wrapped up an even par round of 71 today, 5-under for the championship. I know you wanted to play great golf, that was your biggest goal.  But you were playing with a lot of emotion.  The loss of Angela Bennett, your caddie Lance Bennett's wife.  Now that you've completed this championship, can you give me a summary of the emotions that you were going through this week with your friends grieving back in Texas?MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, quite a challenging week.  I think there's been grieving all over the golf world, everyone knew Lance and Angie.  It was a tough one.  It felt like a lot of the time that I was out on the course I was out there but I wasn't at the same time.  I was going through the motions, but I wasn't quite all there. I'm not quite sure when the week is going to get easier.  I know it will certainly be a long time before it's normal and easy for Lance.  And for me I think it's going to be a couple of weeks.  I can't imagine next week being a whole lot easier with the funeral tomorrow.  I anticipate next week being awfully challenging, as well.Q. I know you've been in communication with Lance.  What are the conversations?MATT KUCHAR: Still awfully depressed.  Every step in the process is still tough.  Meeting with the funeral director, now getting ready for tomorrow's funeral.  Having a memorial, having people come.  He said it's been great the amount of support, people over at the house have helped.  But I think there's times when you have to really understand that she's gone.  It's a tough thing to deal with. I'm not so sure when things will be back to normal for Lance.  I know this process takes a while.  But we're all certainly thinking of him and sending him our prayers and wishes.
