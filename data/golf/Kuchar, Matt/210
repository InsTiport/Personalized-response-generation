Q.   How about today's round? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Steady, solid, made a couple bogeys I wasn't real happy about, but for the most part, some good golf, and two back‑to‑back days of 5‑under par is some steady, solid golf.   Feeling pretty happy with the way my game is in form. 
I didn't really take much of a break.   I played from the McGladrey tournament, Sea Island, played two events in Australia's, played Tiger's, played Shark Shootout and had ten days off and never really put the clubs away like I normally do.   And I thought, if I can just get through the Sony Open, then I'll take my little mini‑break and put the clubs away for a while.   Kind of tried to stay in shape without having to rebound and find it.   Trying to stay somewhat sharp and ready to come out to Hawai'i. 

Q.   So you've got your game rounded into form. 
MATT KUCHAR:   I don't know about rounding, I was just trying to maintain, more than round it into form because it wasn't that much of a break. 

Q.   Do you feel like you're right in this thing? 
MATT KUCHAR:   Yeah, yeah, sure.   It's the halfway point and I've posted two nice scores.   Looks like I'm not too far off the lead so that's a good thing.   36 holes, there's a lot of guys still in this. 

Q.   Conditions today similar to yesterday or a little different? 
MATT KUCHAR:   A little different.   I want to say it was only‑‑ not as different as I figured, the tradewinds and Kona winds, what I expected.   I think the wind only moved a quarter of a degree, quarter turn, I should say.   So wasn't that big of a difference. 

Q.   How much of an adjustment is it to go from here to the tournament next week?
MATT KUCHAR:   Easier to go that way.   That's more what we typically see with the lesser undulation.   This one requires I think a little more course knowledge with the amount of undulations in the greens, particularly. 
Next week is more or less like a Florida course, flat, bermuda golf course, a little more standard.   This one, we don't see many like this. 

Q.   Do you like the winner's‑only format or would you like to see it expand a little bit? 
MATT KUCHAR:   I like the winner's‑only.   I don't see how expanding it has the same allure to it.
