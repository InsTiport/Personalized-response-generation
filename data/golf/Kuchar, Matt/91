Q. Talk us through the math he is city of the 17th, hole-in-one.
MATT KUCHAR: That was amazing.  That was probably one of the saddest hole-in-ones I've ever had, in that most of the time a hole-in-one, you're just overjoyed with excitement.  But then there's a car sitting there, the most beautiful Cadillac sitting on a tee with the note below saying, "This hole is under 200 yards, thus no longer qualifies for the insurance for the giveaway for the prize."
So I've got this nine-year-old son at home that's just a golf junkie, always asking:  If I'd ever made a shot on the range:  What happens if I make any sort of shot; and then have I ever made a hole-in-one with a car on it, and now I finally have.  But unfortunately the insurance was taken away due to the forward tee.
Q. Were you aware of that?
MATT KUCHAR: Literally, I looked down, and it had a note that says something about round three and four.  And I thought, well, the car probably just applies for this weekend's hole-in-ones; that maybe it did not apply to round one and two.
Then my caddie alerted me saying, "It says it's under 200, so it doesn't count for the hole-in-one."
So literally, a minute before my shot, I found out.  Hard to believe that I made the shot.  I guess the way to describe it was the saddest hole-in-one, in that I knew I just made a hole-in-one and I was teased by this beautiful car sitting there, that's not to be mine.
Q. Have you been teased by Sergio Garcia and Henrik Stenson as a result?  Were you chatting to them?
MATT KUCHAR: Sergio was in the group and we all had a good laugh about it.  It wasn't too bad but still good fun.  Henrik came up and said, "My fault, the back tee box was not in very good shape."  He was the one that asked for the tees to be moved forward.  I guess that made the hole far too easy I guess.
Q. He owes you something.
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, he owes me something.
Q. Overall, this notches up your score to a good position on the leaderboard.
MATT KUCHAR: A hole-in-one is great to have; it's an eagle.  In a big event, to go ahead and put 2-under on a scorecard on a hole is a nice thing and certainly helps my placement out a good bit.
