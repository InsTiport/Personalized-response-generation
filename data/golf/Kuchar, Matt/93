  MATT KUCHAR: The opportunities get smaller and smaller. And you try to take advantage. The holes get tougher and tougher. And even the holes that you want to take advantage of, even the parâ€‘5s, you're pretty satisfied walking off a green with a par.   
   
 Q. You've been around here for a long time, you played in the Amateur, obviously. Have you seen conditions like this for two days before?  
MATT KUCHAR: My golfing memory is not great. I'm sure they had some tough conditions. I'm sure the cut has been probably this high or higher in the past. In my years, I'm not sure. We've had a couple tough years. The Zach Johnson year was an awful tough year. It will test you.   
I can remember as an amateur, I can remember playing, and I couldn't believe that I would be done in the clubhouse having a cheeseburger. The round would go so fast. Yesterday was just such a challenging day. I was exhausted by the time I was finished. It used to be, I used to think, I'm ready to go 18 more. Come on, do we have to stop? And I finished 18 both days, and going, all right, I'm relieved I'm done. I'm satisfied with that, and ready to watch the board the rest of the afternoon.   
   
 Q. Are you pleased with your position for 36 holes?  
MATT KUCHAR: I am, absolutely. I think I'm still right in the thick of things, and looking forward to some good weather on the weekend, and I'm sure there will be some good scores on the weekend, as well.
