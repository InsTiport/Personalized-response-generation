 Q.  Matt, just talk about how easy is it, how nice it is to birdie 1 and go to sleep tonight.  
MATT KUCHAR: To finish with a birdie on my final hole, which is 9, is a big surprise.  It was a lucky putt, a great putt, but one you just -- you really hope to make par on 9.  And so fantastic way for me to finish.  Played some good, steady golf all day, and to shoot 2-under was great.  I really was hoping to get in an 1-under, but just that 9th hole there, good to go.   
 Q.  You're three back, that's good shape for first round of the Open?  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah.  Certainly pleased with my opening round.  It was -- yeah, it's a U.S. Open at Pebble.  It's a test.  Even though the conditions were gettable today, it's still a U.S. Open test of golf.   
 Q.  But your year has been pretty good.  Overall you have been in competition contention everywhere you go.  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I'm awfully happy, awfully pleased, awfully proud of what I've done this far.  Certainly you always keep looking forward.  And very excited to be here.  A U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, it doesn't get much better than this.  Just really, really excited for this week.
