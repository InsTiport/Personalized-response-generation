Q. How do you assess your round today?
MATT KUCHAR: It was a very good day.  The wind was up again.  I think anything par or better is a good score.  For me to come in 3-under par is a good day and it keeps me within shouting distance of the lead.  Looking forward to tomorrow, having at least a long shot chance.
Q. What is your mindset going into tomorrow?
MATT KUCHAR: Things don't change much.  Put your ball on the ground on the first hole and try to find the fairway.  You're looking to try to hit a quality shot, if not you're trying to escape and save par.  So it's pretty simple.  I certainly would love to say, listen, I'm going to go out there and I'm going to shoot 64, I'd love to be able to do that.  But golf is an interesting game and you don't have control over that.  You try to find the fairway, try to find the green and keep going from there.
Q. You're a fan favorite here and you won in 2014.  So why do you like coming back?
MATT KUCHAR: It's one of my favorite events of the year.  Every year I so look forward to it.  I love the golf course.  I love the community, the whole atmosphere here.  They've got amazing crowd support.  We stay with good friends that live here in Sea Pines.  It's a great week and I always look forward to it.
Q. What does it feel like walking up to that bunker knowing that's how you walked out of that tournament?
MATT KUCHAR: I'd prefer to find my ball on the green.  There were some great memories from there.  2014 was a special time.  And to finish that way is awful special.
