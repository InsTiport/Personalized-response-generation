 Q.  Hard-fought halve there to advance.  Talk about your match a little bit.  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it was tough.  I had a 1-up lead through 12 holes, I was playing some good steady golf, but so was Jon.  And I went for the green off the tee on 13 and thought I made it.  Just didn't make it.  And so I ended up giving him that hole to go all square.  And looked at John Wood, my caddie, and said, looks like we've got a five-hole match on our hands.  And what a five-hole match it was.   
Both of us birdied 14, one of the harder holes out there.  I chipped in on 15, and he covered me up with about a 12-footer.  And 16 some great wedges.  17, two great shots.  He converted his birdie, and then it was awfully nice to me to kind of flip that drivable, getting the one back from 13, and having one sneak up on the green on 18 was a great way to finish.  I got a bit lucky that his putt slipped by.  I was sweating that, I didn't want to go extra holes with him.   
 Q.  Thoughts on your match with Tyrell Hatton?  
MATT KUCHAR: I don't know Tyrell that well.  I've seen him, I know he's a good player.  I know he's kind of done some great things of late.  And I know that anybody on the Sweet 16 is playing some good golf.  It's going to take a quality round from me, and a lot of good play to move on to the 8.   
 Q.  What's been working to well for you this week.  
MATT KUCHAR: Just steady golf.  It's kind of -- nothing overly exciting.  I put it in play.  It's kind of a simple match play formula, but it's similar to stroke play - fairways, greens.  If you make a mistake, try to get up and down.  And hopefully the short game can bail you out.  But there's no tricky strategy changes.  It's all been pretty good, steady golf.
