 Q.  Dispointing to finish in a halve but a compelling match.  
MATT KUCHAR: Yes, it was a good match.  The end got exciting with some birdies and a lot of good shots hit.  Hideki hit a great shot into 17, was unlucky; it went over the green.   
Bill, I thought he stoned his 5-wood coming in here and shot over the green.  A bit unlucky.  Nothing but quality shots, but kind of seeing some unlucky breaks at the end.   
 Q.  Did you get a sense from the atmosphere and vibe, the momentum changing on both sides, or do you just have your head down?  
MATT KUCHAR: We had a match to look after.  It was definitely one that we had a battle.  It was never more than a 1-up lead.  It was certainly a battle for us and didn't really look up too much.   
 Q.  How is it going against Sangmoon Bae playing here in Korea?  
MATT KUCHAR: You know, he's got great support.  I think the people are excited to see him.  He's certainly really, really hoping to put on a good show and play well, and he's done some great things.  And the putt he made here on 18 yesterday was pretty heroic, and played some good, solid golf today, as well.
