  Q. Just obviously a pretty good match, good result for you. Talk about your game and what it was like.   
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it's always a little scary seeing the draw and seeing Anthony Kim, what kind of player he is. He's one of those guys you can be playing great golf and still get run over. So we each played some very good golf today. I think it was a matter of who missed more putts today than who made more putts today. These greens are tricky. It's hard to get a quality putt at it and a really good read.   
 I played really steady golf, never was in trouble today. Two birdies, no bogeys, so just wore him down.  
  
  Q. You were never down in the match. You must be comfortable with your game, the way you started this year and finished last year?  
 MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, I had a strong finish last year, and equally strong finish this year. I'm happy with the way I'm hitting the ball and putting the ball. And I'm -- this is a fun week. I haven't played a match play event since the Amateur days. It's great to get back and get those nervous feelings. It seems like every hole, every putt is for the tournament. There's so much riding it feels like on every shot.  
  
  Q. I know you withdrew last week, are you feeling okay now?  
 MATT KUCHAR: I'm not a hundred percent just yet but I'm feeling better. I'm glad to get this done early and be able to get back and get more rest. Every day I'm getting better. I'm up in the 90 percent. I need another 10 percent until I start feeling really great again. I'm looking forward to getting some rest and having a great day tomorrow.
