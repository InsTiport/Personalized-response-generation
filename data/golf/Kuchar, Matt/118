Q. That doesn't happen very often, that really well played round of golf.
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, hard to believe.  It was a great save on the last.  Hit a couple good shots on the last, and the ball came rolling back down.  I know better than to leave a ball short because it's such a hard up and down.  I ended up making about a 15-footer to keep that bogey-free streak going.  It was a awfully good round of golf.  I really enjoyed this place and played some good golf today.
Q. I really thought you were in charge of the golf ball.  You kept it in front of you all day long?
MATT KUCHAR: It's been going well for a couple of weeks now.  It's been a great run.  Started at THE PLAYERS, finished third there.  Third at Byron Nelson, sixth last week.  Just got things going really well.  I feel awfully comfortable with all facets of the game.
Q. No wind, receptive greens.  Is that why we're seeing such good scores?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, exactly.  The course is in great shape.  But we've got as benign a conditions as you'll ever get here.
Q. Greens still have a little speed if you get on the wrong side.
MATT KUCHAR: These are typically about as fast as we see all year, but they're in perfect shape.  If you've got any sort of makable range putt, you get it started on the right line, and it's tracking in the hole.
