Q. What was the difference in this match today?
DUSTIN JOHNSON: I felt like we played well. We had two three-putts there, not hitting bad putts. We lipped-out quite a few putts. I felt like we played well, played solid. Obviously they played very well, too. It was a tough match and we hung in there. We did get off to a nice start but this golf course is difficult, and especially it's really difficult in alternate-shot.
I felt like we played pretty solid, though.
Q. You said yesterday that you were pleased although the Internationals won the session, your teammates came back not frustrated to the team room. What do you think the emotions will be today?
MATT KUCHAR: From what I see at the moment, we are digging ourselves a bit of a hole. We need to regroup but thankfully, there's still a whole lot of golf left. There's so many veterans on the team, a handful of rookies; listen, we've been behind before. Others have been behind before and made big come backs. This is still only halfway through, not even halfway through. There's still so many points to play for. I think there's that good veteran leadership that guys know there's still a lot of golf to be played.
