 Q.  Great start, bogey-free, 5-under out here. Obviously you're going to be defending champion next week, but you like Hawai'i, don't you?  
MATT KUCHAR: I love it here. We actually went straight from Presidents Cup, straight from Australia here to Hawai'i. Big Island the last two weeks, hanging out at Kohanaiki, and we love it. The whole aloha life is a good thing and we've enjoyed it, so felt like it was an easy transition for us. Come here, enjoy the holidays, do a bunch of fun things. Every activity on land and every activity on water you can think of we were out doing and just having a great time.   
 Q.  They've made some tweaks on this golf course since last year. What are your thoughts on what they've done and how has that changed the way the golf course plays?  
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it's still Kapalua, still the Plantation course. Listen, it's in better shape. Greens are beautiful. The whole course is in great shape. It's the same. It's the Plantation course. It's just it's in better shape now, and fun to play.   
 Q.  That was an interesting putt you had there at 17. Were you a little fooled by the speed?  
MATT KUCHAR: I was just hoping to be able to get it there. I nearly took a full turn. I was pleased with myself to get it to the hole, although the occasional uphill putt if you hit too hard you're faced with a slippery downhill putt, and I was almost faced with a slippery downhill putt. Glad to see that one go in.
