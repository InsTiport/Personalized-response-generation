 Q.  How tough is this one?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: It's pretty tough.  It sucks, but I mean, to make it this far is great.  I mean, it's all I could ask for.   
 Q.  Is the emotion part exhaustion?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Yeah, I'm really tired.  I told my dad on the last hole, I'm so tired.   
 Q.  On which hole?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: On our last hole.   
 Q.  The very last hole?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you think you just ran out of steam a little bit?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: I mean, I played well today.  I didn't hit it as good as I did the past couple days, but I mean, I have nothing to complain about.  I had one bad hole that cost me on 11 in regulation, but she played great, and she made a lot of really good putts.  I mean, her putt on 18 to take it extra holes was really good.   
 Q.  Had you met her before?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Yeah, I have.  I played her this summer in Arnold Palmer Cup, too.   
 Q.  You're going to have a tough team next year.  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  What's your biggest takeaway on the week?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: I mean, to make it this far is great, and I couldn't think of a better way to finish my last one.
