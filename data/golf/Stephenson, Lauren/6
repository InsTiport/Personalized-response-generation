Q. Felt like after the rain delay you came back with a little more energy.  Do you think it helped?
LAUREN STEPHENSON: I think the rain delay like definitely gave me the momentum.  I hit good shot before we ended, went into the rain delay, so I felt like I kind of had a little bit of an upper hand because she had all the momentum.
So the rain delay really helped.
Q. It's a long day.  How did you keep focused?
LAUREN STEPHENSON: I think with all the match play and the Curtis Cup and everything we've played this year it's really helped me stay mentally focused because you just had to practice it so much.
Q. Going into the quarterfinals tomorrow, what's the game plan?
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Just enjoy it.  I mean, making it back to the same as last year, I wouldn't have expected to do that well because you never really know what's going to happen in match play.
Being this is my last one, just kind of soaking it all up.
