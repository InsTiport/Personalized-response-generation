 Q.  Just talk about how nice it is to see the whole team play well as opposed to just you and your partner.  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Yeah, it's awesome.  I think today was a really great day, and probably not even as we expected.  I think probably a little better.  Everyone played really good today from morning to afternoon, and even though Jennifer and Lilia lost, I know they played great and they fought really hard.  Olivia and Sophie are a great pair, and I saw them making a lot of putts.  I think everyone overall just had a really great day.   
 Q.  I know you guys have been asked about this, but speak to the camaraderie on the team; it doesn't feel like there's a weak link.  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Yeah, it's so much fun.  Some people have said, it's a little bit different than college golf.  We don't really have any drama, and we're just kind of enjoying it, and it's a lot of fun to just be excited for one another and just be a really great team.   
 Q.  What will you take out of this experience?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Oh, gosh.  I think so many things.  All of this match play experience, all of the teammate experience especially, this is a format we never really get to play, so it's just been a lot of fun.
