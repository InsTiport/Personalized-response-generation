 Q.  Alongside Lauren Stephenson, who just matched her career low on the LPGA with a 66 in the opening round of the Cambia Portland classic, and you had a birdie flurry at the end of the round today, birdieing four of your final six. What clicked down the stretch?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Honestly, I hit it well all day. I gave myself a lot of birdie chances throughout the whole day. But then coming down the stretch, I was just trying to get three birdies. I was like, you have five holes left, three birdies is doable, and I actually gave myself a look at birdie on every single hole inside 15 feet. So I could have made more.   
But it was just a really fun day, and I felt like I found something with my ball-striking today, so that helps.   
 Q.  What did you find with your ball-striking?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: I don't know, I was just consistent. I feel like I just tried to play with more feel and have fun and just play aggressive and go at all the flags.   
 Q.  The game hasn't been going as well as you'd like recently. You've come in missing four cuts coming into this week. What changed for you in your game today versus these last few weeks?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: Honestly just a mindset. I feel like you kind of have to put the past behind you, and I know I'm good enough to compete out here at the highest level, and I felt like my game was ready this week and I like the course a lot. I feel like it sets up good for me. So just playing aggressive and playing without fear basically.   
 Q.  What about the course setup lets you play so well?  
LAUREN STEPHENSON: I don't know, I like all the lines off the tee. I feel like the tree line just makes it fun, and I feel like you have a lot of birdie opportunities, so it's just fun.
