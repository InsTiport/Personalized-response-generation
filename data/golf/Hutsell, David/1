  Q. What do you take from this week, anything positive? Obviously your family enjoyed the week?  
 DAVID HUTSELL: They did. This is two years in a row I've been able to share this experience with them, and it's a pleasure to do that.   
 They don't travel with me too much back home to events typically because they are busy doing their thing. So the ability to bring them here with me, and I had some cousins and an uncle who travelled from Tennessee to watch me play a little bit, it just makes it special.  
  
  Q. And you'll be able to go at it again next year in California?  
 DAVID HUTSELL: Absolutely. Looking forward to going to California and hopefully getting back here again next year in Kiawah.
