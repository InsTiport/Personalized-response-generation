 Q. Your thoughts on today's round and expectations throughout the next couple? 
 DAVID HUTSELL: Obviously disappointed. Didn't strike the ball extremely well today, three balls in the water led to one big number; double on 15. But you know, tomorrow is another day. We'll go out and see what we can do tomorrow and try to have some fun.

 Q. How did the course play, the front nine, as opposed to the back nine?
 DAVID HUTSELL: Back nine I think played a little tougher. The par 3s back there are tough. They did move the tees up a little bit on 17.
 But you know, the par 4s, 16 and 14, definitely played tough.
