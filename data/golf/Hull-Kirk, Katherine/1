  KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   It was a bit of an erratic round, but, again, my pars saved me. 
Yeah, just kind of nothing really else to it. 
MODERATOR:   Anna, same question for you.
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I played really solid today.   I had a lot of opportunities and I putted a lot of good putts that seemed to go in.   Couple really good shots that just caught the wind, but overall I'm in a good spot going into tomorrow so I'm very happy. 

Q.   Kind of seems like from both of you from what you've said it could have been a lot lower out there.   Do you think that's promising going into tomorrow, or does that change your mindset at all? 
KATHERINE‑HULL‑KIRK:   I think it's a really scorable golf course.   There are some holes where you have to play smart, but there are definitely low numbers out there if you're hitting it well and putting it well. 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Yeah, I think there are quite a few birdies holes out there.   (Indiscernible) you're happy with par. 
But going into tomorrow, I think whoever shoots the lowest.   You know, there' a lot a lot of girls out there and a lot of girls playing well. 
So you got to shoot a low round tomorrow. 
MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   You have some up and downs.   How will you adjust for tomorrow? 
KATHERINE‑HULL‑KIRK:   Yeah, there was obviously a lot of kind of mistakes today.   I was fortunate I made enough birdies to kind of make up for it.   My golf swing is all right. 
I'm just going to go hit some balls on the range when I'm done here and just get a bit of time back.
But I feel confident with where my game is, and really happy to be in this position. 

Q.   (Question regarding Annika's academy.)
ANNA NORDQVIST:   The last‑‑ up until this year, I was working with (indiscernible) academy in (indiscernible).   I still work with (indiscernible) as part of the team. 
But Annika has always been kind of a legend to me, and I really appreciate her knowledge and her advice. 

Q.   You two played together today.   Did you feed off one another at all?   Was it kind of a struggle out there?
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   I was all over the park, so I don't know if the others were really feeding off fee.   They played pretty solid and kept it pretty simple. 
Yeah, like I said, I was all over the place.

Q.   Is there one thing in particular you're going to work on before tomorrow?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I'm just going to and hit some putts.   We played almost six hours today, so it takes a lot of energy.   We seem to be waiting a lot, so just going to go home and rest.

Q.   I have a question for both of you.   Usually there are complaints that Korean players take a long time to do the game.   So that's the main complaint that I heard.   What do you think about that?   And also, if they need to improve that, how can they address?
ANNA NORDQVIST:   I don't think it's only Korean players in particular.   I haven't played obviously this much over here, I don't know what the pace is over here, but everyone needs to pick up the pace a little bit and prepare a little bit better before.   You know, just be on top of it when it's your turn. 
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   I think everybody can do a better job of being ready to hit when it's their turn.   The PGA TOUR are a lot faster on the greens than we are.   I guess they read their putts faster are than we do.
There is obviously some time that we can make up on the putting green.   But whether we're in Australia, Korea, or the U.S. our rounds tend to take too long or longer than the rules officials would like.   Takes longer than we would like, too.   Just going to take an effort on everyone's part to make it better. 

Q.   Tonight both of you are going sleep with the lead.   You all have won on tour.   Been there, done that before.   What's your mindset going into tomorrow?   What do you think about tonight before you go to sleep?
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   I don't think about a whole lot.   Just grabbing some dinner and talking to my husband and going to sleep. 
Like Anna said before, there are so many good players on the leaderboard and it's really close.   It's anyone's day tomorrow.
Yeah, just go out there and do your best.   Add them up at the end, and whoever has the lowest wins.   You can't control what everyone else is doing.   You can only do your best. 
MODERATOR:   Anna, same question for you.   I know you've been up there quite a bit the past couple years.   What do you think about tonight? 
ANNA NORDQVIST:   Probably going to bed pretty early.   Just excited to put myself in this situation.   I'll talk to some friends and be in a good mood and hopefully wake up happy and ready to go.
