 Q. Let's go over your round here. Bumpy on 4. What happened there?
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah. Hit it right in the greenside bunker and didn't get up-and-down. I don't know the lengths of the putt or anything.

 Q. 7th hole, birdie putt. How far was that? Par-3?
 KATHERINE HULL: That was probably a 30-footer.

 Q. 30-footer. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah.

 Q. Okay. 9th hole?
 KATHERINE HULL: Maybe four feet, five feet. I hit an 8-iron in. 

 Q. How far?
 KATHERINE HULL: To five feet, four or five feet. Oh, how far from? 

 Q. Yeah.
 KATHERINE HULL: No. 9? 133 yards.

 Q. Okay. 10?
 KATHERINE HULL: Hit a 9-iron from 99 yards to three feet. 

 Q. And that last one there. 
 KATHERINE HULL: I hit a four hybrid. Maybe 60 feet.

 Q. 60. Nice. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah. Probably 60, somewhere in there.

 Q. How did you feel today? Needless to say, the conditions early in the day were difficult for the players. Looks like the wind died down some here. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yes. The wind died maybe half a club this evening, but it got cooler, so it was still playing about the same yardage.
 I hit it really well on the front nine and then just got a little sloppy on occasion on the back nine, but yeah, I was really happy with the start.

 Q. You're at the top of the leaderboard with Yani. Did you realize that after you made that putt?
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah. I was looking at leaderboards all day, so yeah, it was nice to roll that one in. But it's Thursday, so it's early in the week.

 Q. Have you played this course before?
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, back in '05.

 Q. And what was your success there?
 KATHERINE HULL: NC. I think I got the bad end of the weather. I think I played well in the second round, but I was too far back after the first. I love the long golf course.

 Q. You like Links golf?
 KATHERINE HULL: I love Links golf, yep, and in particular this course.

 Q. Are you feeling really good the last few weeks? I don't know what you did last week. 
 KATHERINE HULL: I've felt pretty good all year, but it's just been patchy, and I actually figured out something with my caddy maybe two days ago. 

 Q. What was that?
 KATHERINE HULL: It's helped. It's a bit of a secret.

 Q. It's a secret?
 KATHERINE HULL: It's a secret.

 Q. Why is that?
 KATHERINE HULL: It's a state's secret. Put it this way, I was getting a little lazy. 

 Q. So does that mean you are working a little harder out there?
 KATHERINE HULL: It's something to do with my routine actually, not in terms of work ethic really. It was lazy with my routine.

 Q. And you've seen the progress after your caddy -- what is your caddy's name, by the way?
 KATHERINE HULL: Vern Tess, V-E-R-N, T-E-S-S.

 Q. Do you feel you're playing better this year than you've ever played or?
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, my ball striking has been the best it's ever been. And I get a patchy part whereas before it was more so my short game. 
 Last year my putting was great. This year it's been patchy, so we're just trying to piece it all together, and it's getting close. 

 Q. All right. Thank you. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Thank you.
