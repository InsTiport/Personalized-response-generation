 Q. Thoughts today, 1-under, so I guess on the right side of the ledger, but then I saw you parred all the way home. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, that was frustrating, because I was hitting the ball well. I just couldn't get a putt to drop. So maybe that means I'll drop tomorrow; because I like to think the law of averages is in my favour (smiling).

 Q. And then you actually started on 10, but I guess I'll ask, bogey on the par 5 must have been a bit annoying; bogeyed 15 and birdied 16 and 18. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, I had a wedge in on 15 and I got a flyer out of the rough. Then I hit a bad chip shot and obviously 2-putted. Just one of those things, just happened to be on a par 5. I didn't read too much into it.

 Q. But bounced back pretty quickly with a couple of nice birdies. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, I hit a really good up-and-down on 16 for birdie and then hit a great shot into 18 and made a good putt, too, so that was nice. 
 Finished that nine 1-under. Just couldn't get anything going on the back which is frustrating, but that's golf.

 Q. How did you find of golf course? The breeze is still up today I think, pretty similar to yesterday. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, I think the conditions are fairly similar, but the pins are probably a little more accessible today. Cristie made the comment even that we were playing like Sunday pins yesterday. So definitely I think a few more easier hole locations today. 

 Q. And then into the weekend now, I think the leaders are on 7, but a few holes to go. What's your mind-set or game plan going into the weekend? 
 KATHERINE HULL: Won't change. Just go out there and do my best. 

 Q. Lots of birdies?
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, I need lots of birdies. I need to get a hot putter.
