Q.   Take us through your hole‑in‑one. 
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   Hit a little 5‑iron.   Just took a little bit off it and it landed I think about eight yards short of the hole and took one or two bounces and just rolled in. 
We were debating whether we saw it go in or if it finished behind the hole.   We couldn't quite tell.   We heard the two guys up near the green kind of cheer, and that was good enough for me. 
It was exciting.

Q.   You won a brand new 2014 Kia Cadenza.   Tell us how you feel about that. 
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   Super excited.   I didn't know that was on the line.   One of the LPGA staff guys came up to me on one of the holes just a couple holes ago and said, Oh, congrats on the car.   I'm like, What?   We won one? 
Yeah, really thankful for Kia to sponsor it.   I will be very delighted to drive it around.   My husband and I were actually debating about buying a car because we've been splitting his. 
I guess I'll have my own now.

Q.   That obviously put a little hop in your step the rest of the day. 
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   The hole‑in‑one?   Definitely, yeah.   I guess I had a lot of holes to play, though.   I haven't made too many cuts this year, so I still had to play well coming in. 
That definitely helped the score at the end of the day.

Q.   At what point did you hear about the car?
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   Now that I think about it, only on the 7th hole, which is my third‑last hole.   Confirmed.   So I guess maybe if I had found out earlier I might have been a bit more jittery out there. 

Q.   Or distracted. 
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   Or distracted.   Yeah.

Q.   For the day, 4‑under until that last hole.   You gave one back.   What was the big difference between yesterday and today? 
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   I think I just hit more fairways today and definitely hit more greens.   So I had more chances to make birdie.
Yeah, just I was able to make a couple birdies, and that hole‑in‑one certainly helped.   Nothing drastic, but, yeah, just finally went my way today.

Q.   One general comment about your year to date.   Talk your season so far. 
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   It's been sloppy.   I switched coaches back in March and just been struggling with getting confidence in what I've been working on.
Yeah, hopefully this will be the turning point.   I've always loved Toledo and love coming here.   Hopefully I get some good vibes this weekend.

Q.   And a brand new set of wheels. 
KATHERINE HULL‑KIRK:   And a brand new set of wheels.
