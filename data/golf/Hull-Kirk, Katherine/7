 Q. How did you find it out there? The wind obviously made it a bit of a challenge. 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, there was a couple of holes where they were back pins and you're dead into the wind, so it's always makes it a bit trickier because you don't want to stuff it in there but you also need to get it back in play. 
 It wasn't easy out there, but it wasn't overly hard, either. So you'll still see some birdies out there.

 Q. And you mentioned the greens a bit slower than your years here in the past?
 KATHERINE HULL: I don't know about in years past but certainly coming from Thailand, I feel like nine on the Stimp. I think they are probably about ten or ten and a half, though. It feels very slow. Especially if you're uphill into the grain.

 Q. There are nine or ten players under par, with a four-day tournament, right still in the mix there, really?
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, if you're within, technically, I think even six shots of the lead on a Sunday sometimes you can jump up and have a chance.
 So, yeah, right now, I mean, certainly not going to win the tournament, and I don't think you're going to lose it if you're 1- or 2-over par.

 Q. Game plan going into tomorrow from what you've seen out there today? 
 KATHERINE HULL: Same game plan, just mentally sharper. My brain went on vacation on the 16th hole. So, yeah, it will be just be more mentally disciplined tomorrow will be the difference.

 Q. And can you talk us through 16? 
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much a birdie hole and I kind of took it for granted and mentally just switched off and wasn't as sharp, so hit the drive left and hit a poor second and didn't get up-and-down.
