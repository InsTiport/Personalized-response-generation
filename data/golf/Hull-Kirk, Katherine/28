   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Katherine, thanks for coming in and joining us today. I know you didn't have the finish you wanted to there on 18, but, nonetheless, looks like you're just four shots out of the lead.   
 And I think I looked back and at Canada going into the final round you were six strokes out of the lead, so anything certainly possible; right?   
 KATHERINE HULL: Absolutely.   
 Kind of disappointed, obviously, with the last hole, but I know if I start out strong tomorrow I'll be happy, and, obviously, see what happens at the end.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Sure.   
 You had some solid rounds you put together to really climb up the leader board the past three days. Can you just talk about the golf course and how you are playing. This is the fist year, I think, you had the chance to play here at Mobile.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah, the golf course reminds me of a lot of courses back home in Australia because we get the humidity on the east coast where I live. Obviously, the muted grass grows there, and I'm kind of use to the grain on the green. So I guess that's why I feel comfortable out there.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Let's go over your scorecard. Busy day. The birdie on 2. Got to think far back.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Oh, a Par 3. I cut a 5-iron into about five feet and made it.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And the eagle on 4.  
 KATHERINE HULL: I hit a 7-wood to the back fringe and made the putt from probably, oh, 45 feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Nice putt.   
 Bogey on 5. What happened there?  
 KATHERINE HULL: Missed the fairway and went through the green and then hit my like blade wedge on the fringe. And then missed the par putt from like probably 20 feet, then tapped in for bogey.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 6.  
 KATHERINE HULL: I think it's a Par 5?   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yes.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Hit my driver in the fairway bunker, tapped a 7-wood, then hit a 5-iron to about, maybe, 12, 15 feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 8.  
 KATHERINE HULL: It was a Par 3; isn't it?   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yes.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Hit a 7-iron to about five or six feet, six feet, and made it.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 9.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Three-putted from the back fringe.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far?  
 KATHERINE HULL: Oh, probably, 35 feet, 40 feet.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 10.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Hit a 9-iron to a foot.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 12.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Hit a pitching wedge to three or four feet, 3-and-a-half feet.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 14.  
 KATHERINE HULL: I three-putted from maybe 12 feet.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 15.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Par 4?   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Yeah.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Hit a 9-iron to four feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 16.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Hit a 5-wood on the green in two and two-putted. The first putt was long. It probably was a good, maybe, 75 feet.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. And take us through the double-bogey on 18.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Hit left off the tee into the rough and didn't have a great lie; had 122 yards to the flag, and, yeah, came up short in the bunker; hit a bad bunker shot, and my fourth shot didn't roll out as much as I thought; and then I just misread the putt for bogey and tap in for double.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far was the bogey putt?  
 KATHERINE HULL: Six, seven feet.  
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: All right. Questions for Katherine?  
  
  Q. To end a round like that, particularly a round that you had going so well, what do you take from that going to tomorrow and how do you push that out of your mind?  
 KATHERINE HULL: I'll probably forget about it in about ten minutes because -- I mean, the bottom line is I shot 68 and played pretty well. I only really had a couple bad swings out there. So you got to look at the positives, build on those and kind of take that confidence into tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Not to make you remember it any more, but the bunker shot, what happened on that, on 18?  
 KATHERINE HULL: Just lost all focus. I guess I haven't had a lot of bunker shots and kind of probably took it a little for granted.  
  
  Q. I think this is the third tournament in a row, if I am not mistaken, that you've played really well. I think you had a win two tournaments ago. Just talk about how you are playing right now?  
 KATHERINE HULL: I've been swinging it pretty well this year. Obviously, once your confidence kind of gets a little boost, then you kind of ride it as long as you can. And, you know, everything's kind of clicking.  
 So it's nice finally because the hard work's paying off. But you've got to still continue to work through the process and execute your plan. You can't slack off; especially out here because we've got so many great players and anyone can win and you just got to keep working harder.   
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Thanks, Katherine. Have a good day and we'll see you tomorrow.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Thanks.
