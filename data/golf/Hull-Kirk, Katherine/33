  Q. Can you just take us through the 7th hole, what you hit off the tee, what you hit from the fairway, yardage, all that?  
 KATHERINE HULL: I hit a driver off the tee and had 212 yards to the front, 229 yards to the hole.   
 I told, John, my caddy I was going to hit it at the black transportation vehicle and he goes, "Why don't you go to the edge of the green?" I kind of changed my line and I hit it pretty good and just got right bounces and right roll and in it went.  
  
  Q. How many bounces, did it take, did it checkup?  
 KATHERINE HULL: I didn't count. John wasn't watching. When I saw it disappear, I said, "John, I just made it." It was just like non-chalant. He was like, "Oh, my gosh." High fives in the group.  
  
  Q. Is it J-O-H-N or J-O-N?  
 KATHERINE HULL: J-O-H-N.  
  
  Q. Last name?  
 KATHERINE HULL: Powell.  
  
  Q. First double eagle you've ever made?  
 KATHERINE HULL: Yes. Yeah. I don't think I've every come close before.  
  
  Q. Butterflies? What was the feeling?  
 KATHERINE HULL: Well, I was excited but I'm actually a lot of holes to go. I just kind of took it in my stride, I guess. But, yeah, I mean heck, you take that any day.  
  
  Q. Who is the gentleman that was hanging out with your caddy in the black, talked to you?  
 KATHERINE HULL: He's another caddy. They're buddies. Yeah.  
  
  Q. Very good. Did that kind of fire you up then for the rest of the round because then you -- you had one stretch I think three birdies or something.  
 KATHERINE HULL: I try to keep level with my emotions out there because, as it is, I'm kind of wired and so if I get too excited then I think I get -- my swing gets a little quick and hit some errant shots.  
 Just try and stay pretty level keel out there and I obviously was still -- there were 11 holes to go at that point and a lot can happen over 11 holes.  
  
  Q. Turned into a pretty good money day for you, though, no matter what happens.  
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah.  
  
  Q. What do you figure that double eagle is worth today?  
 KATHERINE HULL: I don't know. It's not too often I get 3-under on a hole. Yeah. I just kind of played solid all day, really. Other than one mistake on 10, I hit it pretty well and putted well. So I'm happy.  
  
  Q. What happened at 10?  
 KATHERINE HULL: Little click off the tee and hit it in the bunker, chunked my second. Misjudged the lie for my 3rd and then chipped on and missed a 3, 4-footer. Made double, which was kind of frustrating but I was just fortunate to make some birdies coming in which was nice.
