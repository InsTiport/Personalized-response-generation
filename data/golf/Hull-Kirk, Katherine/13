   THE MODERATOR: We have Katherine Hull in here who's just shot a 66 for a 198 total. The round included five straight birdies on the last five holes. There's a couple of people on deadline, so if we could do the birdies first, if that's possible.
 KATHERINE HULL: No. 6. I can't even think of 6. Par-5. I hit a pitching wedge to about three feet, made the putt. 
 14, I hit a 5-iron to about six feet. 15, I hit a gap wedge to about maybe 12 feet. 16, hit a 5-iron to 20 feet. 17, got up-and-down out of the bunker.
 THE MODERATOR: What did you hit into 17? 
 KATHERINE HULL: I'm sorry. A hybrid into there and then, yeah, tap-in for birdie out of the sand. 
 And then 18, I hit a 7-iron onto just the back of the green and two-putted. The second putt was maybe seven feet.
 THE MODERATOR: Okay. And that was a pretty hot finish there.
 KATHERINE HULL: Yeah. I didn't make many putts yesterday, so it was nice to finish with five in a row today. 
 THE MODERATOR: Are there any questions from the people who are -- we have a microphone here, as usual. 

 Q. Just how important are the par-5s around Birkdale, especially with three on the last four holes?
 KATHERINE HULL: Well, obviously you can reach 17 and 18 when they're downwind, and if it's not too blowy, you can also reach 15. So if you're not making birdies, you do feel like you're losing ground out there. 
 Yeah, I mean 6 is a makeable birdie, too, so you gotta kind of capitalize, especially on the par-5s out here. 

 Q. Have you ever had five birdies on the spin before, and in the last five holes with you in the lead?
 KATHERINE HULL: Maybe once before. I know I've had five birdies in a row, but I'm trying to think. Yeah, actually maybe in college. I think I finished with five birdies to shoot like 63. That was one of my best rounds. So yeah, never in a major, so it was fun.

 Q. That's your best round in a major?
 KATHERINE HULL: Probably, yeah. 

 Q. You haven't had too much great success here at this tournament. Can you tell me kind of what's changed this year, and the British Open in general?
 KATHERINE HULL: Probably in the last couple years I've started to shape the ball more, and you gotta be able to do that in Links golf, just because the wind usually plays such a factor in it. 
 So yeah, my ball striking is getting better every year, and I love Links golf now. It's fun to me. I wish we actually played more of it in the States.

 Q. Am I right to say this is the first time you've played Birkdale?
 KATHERINE HULL: I played in '05, but I got the bad weather draw, so we had a rough day Thursday and was too far out of it. 
 THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? Thank you very much.
 KATHERINE HULL: Thank you. 
 THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow.
