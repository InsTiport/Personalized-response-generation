 Q.  Just talk me through a little bit about your round today.  
BRIANA CHACON: Let's see, a lot of my irons were pretty sharp.  I was just hitting like every single green.  My iron game was really good today and just had a few putts drop in.   
Overall pretty good day.   
 Q.  What's been your favorite part out here this week so far?  
BRIANA CHACON: My favorite part?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
BRIANA CHACON: 16 hole, the flower hole, definitely.  Like it's just so pretty.  One of my favorite holes for sure.   
 Q.  Who would you say are some of your favorite role models in golf?  
BRIANA CHACON: One of my friends, Lee Lopez, who is playing on tour.  I've known her since I was like six years old.  She's what inspired me to play golf like competitively.  I just really looked up to her when I was a little kid.   
 Q.  So quarterfinalist in the U.S. Girls' Junior.  What does that mean to you?  
BRIANA CHACON: Means a lot.  This is my first U.S. Girls' as a senior or graduated senior, which is kind of sad.   
Means a lot just to play if such a prestigious event.  I know so many great names have won it and means a lot just to be here.   
 Q.  Mindset going into tomorrow and the game plan?  What's it going to take to keep the momentum going?  
BRIANA CHACON: Just keep playing my game.  Get some more putts to drop.
