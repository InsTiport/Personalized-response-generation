JIMIN KANG: It's great. I think I played good, too, but she played so awesome. There
was nothing I could do.

JIMIN KANG: Yes, it is.

JIMIN KANG: It's not little. It's going to really hurt.

JIMIN KANG: A dime.

JIMIN KANG: Not really. It's all mental game. A little bit.

JIMIN KANG: What did she shoot today? She made so many birdies. 7-under par? Give me a
break. She was so awesome. Like every single putt she made, I was like: Wow. I asked her:
Give me some lessons.

JIMIN KANG: Just a little bit. Well, I was like: Hey, girl, give me some lessons to
putt like you. That's all I did. She always talk to her dad. She's speaking, da-da-da --
okay.

Q. In the afternoon, 18 on No. 4, how long was that putt that you missed? Four feet,
five feet for birdie on the par 5? How long was that?

JIMIN KANG: It was probably two or three feet.

Q. Do you think that was the turning point for you? You had a chance to kind of get
back into the match.

JIMIN KANG: That was a good chance. 

Q. Can you tell us about the four-putter from fringe to fringe on the 6th hole?

JIMIN KANG: I have no idea what I was doing. (Laughter.)

Q. Is it hard to regain your focus after that?

JIMIN KANG: Not really. Just get too much frustrated after that.

Q. On the next hole, it looked like you had kind of chunked a chip shot and came up
short.

JIMIN KANG: Actually, that was my plan. I was like: Okay, I need to get it up there,
and it will go around and get on the green, because I did it before. And: Oh, my, God, it
stopped. My putting has been totally messed up.

Q. So do you think putting was a big key today?

JIMIN KANG: Yeah.

Q. How good a putter is Dorothy Delasin?

JIMIN KANG: I bet she made every single putt on the green. On the greens, she made the
putts -- boom. If I don't make the putt, I'm just -- lose that hole.

Q. Did that put a lot of pressure on you? If you miss, she's going to get you?

JIMIN KANG: I know that I'm going to get a chance, too. Well, actually, there wasn't
more pressure. It was frustrating.

Q. What did you think when your mom pulled the entire cup out of the 1st hole?

JIMIN KANG: Oh, my God.

Q. Do you think maybe that's a bad omen?

JIMIN KANG: Not at all. She was kind of hurrying. And I was like: Oh, no.

Q. Was it strange for you to be down? I guess you played from behind all day. But
before today you hadn't been behind probably at all.

JIMIN KANG: When I was 2-up, usually I do cover it up, but not this time. She was so
awesome. Unbelievable. There is nothing I can say. I didn't think I didn't play that bad,
either.

Q. Did you think it was over this morning on 17?

JIMIN KANG: Yeah, because I never played a 36-hole match. I was like 2 -- 3-up or 2-up
on No. 17. So I felt that was the last hole. And then going into No. 18, I was like: Okay,
what's going on here? (Laughter.)

Q. Was it hard to get your mind back into thinking that you still had a chance?

JIMIN KANG: No, not at all, because I got more chance. "Oh, yeah, that's good. I
get to play more now."

Q. Who actually told you that there was, in fact, an afternoon -- 

JIMIN KANG: Everyone goes 18. I just asked one of the rulers: "Are we done?"
"No, you are playing 18 holes." I was like: "Okay."

Q. Did you not know it was 36 holes before?

JIMIN KANG: I did not know how it goes, because usually if the match goes, if you're
2-down No. 17, it's over. But we go onto 18.

Q. Do you think you are going to leave this tournament as a more confident golfer? Are
you going to have higher expectations for yourself?

JIMIN KANG: I never thought I'm a good golfer, and I still don't.

Q. You don't?

JIMIN KANG: Whenever I think: Jimin Kang, you're so good. And then to myself, I'm like
-- I feel like I'm looking at someone else, some other character. I was like: Wow, Jimin
Kang, she is good. Wow. And when they are like talking to me, I don't think so. It's not
me.

Q. So what are your plans now? You go back to high school and you consider college?

JIMIN KANG: Go to college, yes.

Q. I saw that you had a recruiting, or a letter from a certain school that you were
looking at?

JIMIN KANG: Oh, in the morning? It was a notice from some college and friends. It was
really neat.

Q. Do you have some favorite colleges that you're looking at?

JIMIN KANG: Me? Okay. So many college coaches that want to hit for me, but I'm trying
to not tell anyone yet. But I want to go to ASU. To me, ASU is the best golf, I think.
Shh! (Laughter.)

Q. When does your high school golf season start?

JIMIN KANG: Spring.

Q. You don't play a fall season at all?

JIMIN KANG: No, not at my school.

Q. I assume you are No. 1 on your team?

JIMIN KANG: Yes, I am. You know, I played the high school championship last spring, and
it was two days and I won by 21 strokes. I was like: Oh my God, that was too much.
Everyone said: How could you have done that, 21 strokes? "Sorry, I didn't think of
the strokes."

Q. What is the name of your high school?

JIMIN KANG: Kings High School. It's a private Christian school.

Q. Are you looking forward to going back to school or starting school, or do you want
to play more golf? 

JIMIN KANG: Yeah, sure. (Laughter.)

Q. Any phone calls last night from Korea?

JIMIN KANG: No. I called my dad. "Dad, I don't want you to call me too late at
night, because I'm going to go to bed because my tee time is 8 o'clock." He's like:
"Okay, good luck. I'm so proud of you. You've gone so far." In my country, it's
like -- my country has like -- my country is like almost bankrupt; so, it was really,
really bad condition for every single like -- they are kind of like -- I'm kind of give
them a little joy in Korea, go to finals; and then last year, Grace Park won. So they are
like: Oh, my God, there's another Korean. She came in and won this one championship. So
many people cheered me. And I gave them a little hope, too. So that was really nice.

Q. Can you go through a couple holes, the 6th hole this morning? You made birdie. What
did you hit in? Do you remember what club?

JIMIN KANG: What number was that?

Q. The 6th hole this morning? Par 4 before the par 5.

JIMIN KANG: I think I shot 7-iron.

Q. And then on the par 5?

JIMIN KANG: On the par 5, driver, 3-wood and putted.

Q. Talk about that putt a little?

JIMIN KANG: I know that was downhill left-to-right. I was like: Okay, and it's eagle
putt; right. I was like: Okay, just a little bit past the hole, because I'm not a good
putter. So I was like: Okay, please. I hit it; it looks like it goes into the hole. I was
like: "Go, go, go." Boom. Yeah. That was really good.

Q. And the 17th hole in the morning?

JIMIN KANG: Oh, I hit the driver chipped -- putt, putt.

Q. What did you chip with?

JIMIN KANG: Pitching wedge.

Q. And thing the 13th hole? You hit -- what did you chip with in the afternoon?

JIMIN KANG: Sand wedge.

Q. What's your mother's first name?

JIMIN KANG: E-U-N-H-A-E.

Q. What's your father's name?

JIMIN KANG: J-O-O-B-O-X.

Q. Do you have any other tournaments the rest of the year?

JIMIN KANG: I don't think so. This my last tournament for the amateur and the summer
season.

Q. Did you say when school starts? 

JIMIN KANG: September 8th.
