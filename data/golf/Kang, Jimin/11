JIMIN KANG: Well, last year Grace Park win this tournament, and I got to go to finals.
So, it's really exciting. And for being Korean, also. I got phone calls from Korea from
television channels, and they cheered me up. I was like: "Thank you." But they
called me at like 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. I've got to go to bed. "Well, we just wanted to
wish you good luck." I was like: "Thank you."

Q. Was that last night?

JIMIN KANG: Yes.

Q. What time?

JIMIN KANG: 10:30 to 11:00.

Q. And you were asleep?

JIMIN KANG: I couldn't go to bed.

Q. How many phone calls did you get?

JIMIN KANG: There's one phone call, but there's like so many people like changing and
talking to me.

Q. How many people do you think you talked to?

JIMIN KANG: Three or four.

Q. These are friends or relatives?

JIMIN KANG: No. I didn't know them. It was like: My name is da-da-da, nice meeting you.
And I was like: Yes.

Q. Are you expecting some more calls tonight?

JIMIN KANG: I hope not.

Q. Can you talk about the front side where you went up by 3?

JIMIN KANG: Well, she plays really good. But, like, I think I was kind of a little more
luckier than her. Because first, she just didn't play well; that's why I won. And then 2nd
hole, the same situation. And then No. 3, she made the putt, and I was like: Okay, I
cannot lose. I have to make this putt. That was a really tough putt. I was kind of
impressed that I made that putt.

Q. How long were your birdie putts on 3?

JIMIN KANG: It was really short. But it was like downhill and like this. I was like:
Okay, I have to get really, really right.

JIMIN KANG: No, it's more than that. It's like probably six, seven, downhill
right-to-left. 

Q. Could you call it a turning point in the match that early in the round? Do you think
No. 3 was the turning point, even though it was so early?

JIMIN KANG: Not really, no.

Q. Lorena played so well all week, were you surprised you made the turn and you were
3-up? What were your thoughts when you made the turn and you were up by three?

JIMIN KANG: It's the same. I said, like, I try not to think of how the score is going
on, because if I keep going with like my scores, I get too excited; so, I don't play well
enough. It's like, yeah, I'm 3-up after -- yeah, right. My mom is trying to calm me down:
Don't forget the whole thing; we have to get one hole at a time. That's all I did.

Q. What's your mom's name?

JIMIN KANG: E-U-N-H-A-E.

Q. And that's two words?

JIMIN KANG: Yes.

Q. No hyphen?

JIMIN KANG: Maybe. (Laughter.)

Q. What do you remember from your last match against Dorothy? She said you were 3-up
and she made five birdies in a row.

JIMIN KANG: Only thing I remember, I made eagle, and I won that hole. After that, I was
total loss. She makes birdie, birdie, birdie -- boom. That's all I remember. And that was
the first match I ever played before.

Q. Is that right?

JIMIN KANG: Yeah.

Q. That was your first match ever?

JIMIN KANG: Yes.

Q. You were how old?

JIMIN KANG: I'm 19 years old now. Then, probably 17 -- no, 16.

Q. What do you think you've learned since then?

JIMIN KANG: Well, I just learn how match goes a little bit. Okay, match is like every
single hole is more important, okay. That's all.

Q. Do you think you got too excited when you got that eagle? Is that what you're
saying, that you kind of lost focus?

JIMIN KANG: Probably not. I was like: Okay, I have to make this putt. Actually, I was
chipping. I just try to win.

Q. How does your mom help you out there?

JIMIN KANG: Carry the bag. (Laughter.)

Q. Does she encourage you?

JIMIN KANG: Well, it's true. (Laughter.)

Q. Does she keep you happy?

JIMIN KANG: Yeah, she just try to make me feel more comfortable.

Q. Do you get down on yourself?

JIMIN KANG: Well, see, I know that I can make the putts. But I couldn't read it right,
and I miss the putt, and I get frustrated. My mom is like: Okay, you still get par here.
I'm like: I'm done; I'm okay.

Q. Is it part of your demeanor. I notice when you play you smile a lot and wave at the
crowd. You seem like you're really enjoying yourself out there. Is that something your mom
wants you to do, or is it your natural personality?

JIMIN KANG: It's natural.

Q. But that's interesting, because I've seen Se Ri play a lot, and she was --

JIMIN KANG: I'm not like that kind of person.

Q. Se Ri is not necessarily the Korean way; right?

JIMIN KANG: That is Korean way. I'm kind of more like--

Q. Americanized? Westernized?

JIMIN KANG: Kind of, yeah.

Q. That's from spending so much time in the States?

JIMIN KANG: Probably different personality. I'm kind of, like, hang out with the
friends more. I like to make more friends, you know. But she's kind of like --

Q. You ever met her?

JIMIN KANG: Yeah. I know her. She's a friend of mine.

Q. How about Grace? Good friends with Grace?

JIMIN KANG: (Nods.)

Q. You haven't heard from Grace this week, have you?

JIMIN KANG: I try to call her, but she's always busy.

Q. Maybe tonight. Wake her up. Did you get a little excited on 16 there? It looked like
you bladed that chip coming off.

JIMIN KANG: I was like: What am I doing? I thought I was going to go to No. 17. And
then she putted, and I was like: Oh, what is she doing? I was kind of lucky.

Q. Who taught you golf, or how did you pick up the game?

JIMIN KANG: Professional golfer?

Q. How did you learn golf like when you were a kid? Did your family play, or just
something you wanted to do?

JIMIN KANG: When I was amateur, one of the senior coach, he ask my parents, like -- my
parents are like: No. She needs more study. So I stopped it. At the school during P.E.
class I was really good at P.E., everything. So P.E. teacher said I want you to do some
sports. So I asked my parents, all I want to do is being athletic. My parents were like:
Why don't you try golf. I was like "Okay." That's how I started.

Q. What age?

JIMIN KANG: 13.

Q. How big a role does the parent play in your golfing? Was it something they really
encouraged you to do? How do they respond to you when you win stuff like this, keep
getting all these accolades and stuff?

JIMIN KANG: I love to play golf. And just being on the field, it just let me out and
practice whatever I do. They don't worry about: Like you need practice. They never say
that because I just do it. I really enjoy doing it. So my parents are like whenever I win,
they say: Oh, good job, I'm so proud of you.

Q. Did you say yesterday there were times when they had to stop you from practicing
because you practiced too much too much?

JIMIN KANG: Yeah, when I was in Korea.

Q. So you picked up the game in Korea. Is golf big in Korea?

JIMIN KANG: Yes, it is.

Q. Do people pretty much know who you are as an amateur or are they more interested in
pros?

JIMIN KANG: Well, when I was in Junior, they knew me, but I was -- I think they knew
me. I don't know. I haven't go back to Korea for a while.

Q. Do Korean media people call you and want to know things about your amateur golf?

JIMIN KANG: Yeah, nowadays.

Q. How much?

JIMIN KANG: Well, my dad just asked me questions and I answer it, and he tell every
single newspaper writer; so I don't know.

Q. Is this something that you do often in the summertime? Once a week, once a day?

JIMIN KANG: Whenever I go to game, tournament.

Q. Are you feeling any pressure right now?

JIMIN KANG: No, not at all.

Q. How can you not be feeling pressure?

JIMIN KANG: You know, that's a good question, but I don't know, either.
You know, I didn't get any nervous at U.S. Open, either. Everyone said: Are you
nervous? First I shot 70 and second day I shot 79. They said, "Did you get nervous on
the second day?" I said: "I was sick; that's why I didn't play well." I was
excited play with LPGA professional golfers.

Q. Have you ever felt pressure playing golf at any time?

JIMIN KANG: Not nowadays. Probably at beginning of the -- when I started playing golf.

Q. What about on No. 16? Didn't you feel a little nervous today on hole No. 16, your
last hole?

JIMIN KANG: I wasn't nervous. I was frustrated. Really frustrated.

Q. Why?

JIMIN KANG: I hit the top of the hole and went way past the hole.

Q. What happened there? Did you just top -- hit it then?

JIMIN KANG: I hit it really thin.

Q. Is that the first time you've been frustrated this week?

JIMIN KANG: Maybe not.

Q. Where was the tournament in '96 where you played Dorothy?

JIMIN KANG: North Carolina -- no, no. North Dakota or South Dakota. I don't know. It's
a long time ago.

Q. What do you think about Dorothy's game?

JIMIN KANG: Well, I haven't seen her for a while. At that time she was a great player.
Looking forward to playing with her tomorrow.

Q. Is that the most autographs you've ever had to sign after a round?

JIMIN KANG: You know when I went to U.S. Open, that was like way more. Whenever you get
off the practice green or driver range, everyone is like coming up to you: Can I get
autograph. Okay. It was fun doing it.

Q. Did you always sign your own name?

JIMIN KANG: Yeah.

Q. In English or Korean?

JIMIN KANG: English. I can write Korean. Well, they probably don't understand.
