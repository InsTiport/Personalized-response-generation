JIMIN KANG: Yes.

Q. Did you turn pro?

JIMIN KANG: No, no.

JIMIN KANG: I'm okay to turn professional because I'm 19.

JIMIN KANG: It's hard to say. It's so awesome. I played really good today; so I'm
really excited to go to the semifinals.

JIMIN KANG: What do you mean?

JIMIN KANG: I tried not to think about it, because I didn't know what was going to
happen every single hole. See, if I can get a par, but she can get a birdie, birdie,
birdie. Then I'm just losing; so I try to not think about it and try to hit every single
shot one at a time, the best that I can. That's all that I did.

JIMIN KANG: Korea.

Q. You went 3-up right out of the gate. What happened?

JIMIN KANG: I think it was three holes. I was like: Whoa.

Q. What happened in those three holes?

JIMIN KANG: Well, 1st hole was easy birdie. I chipped it, and then like really, really
close.

Q. How close were you?

JIMIN KANG: I think it was like three feet -- I think it was two feet.

Q. Did you drive down the bottom of the hill or were you up top?

JIMIN KANG: I was up top of the 1st hole. It was like this, (indicating three feet).

Q. And what happened on the 2nd hole?

JIMIN KANG: 2nd hole, I got a par; she chipped in over the green and then chipped on.

Q. And then the 3rd hole?

JIMIN KANG: 3rd hole. Oh, she went over the green, and then she chipped it, and then
she missed her putt. And then I missed a birdie putt and made the par putt.

Q. Is it harder or easier to stay focused when you get out of the gate like that and
you're 3-up? Is it hard to keep going?

JIMIN KANG: Yes, it is.

Q. Because it came so easy, right? First three holes you're 3-up.

JIMIN KANG: Yes, it is true.

Q. What did you do to keep concentrating throughout the match?

JIMIN KANG: My mom kept saying: One at a time. Don't think about the 3-up. I was like:
Okay.

Q. Your mom is caddying for you, right?

JIMIN KANG: 36 holes -- well, less than that. I think it was 34 holes.

JIMIN KANG: She is 44.

JIMIN KANG: She did last week, too. North and South.

JIMIN KANG: Well, she is the best caddie.

JIMIN KANG: Actually, she only can do is carry the bag and just try and make me calm
down. That's all she did. Whenever I ask her: Mom, what do you think? Is that this way or
this way? She says: I don't know. Just do whatever you want. (Laughter.)

Q. You beat a really good player in this match. Are you surprised?

JIMIN KANG: Well, you know, I met her before, and I've played her before in 1997; so, I
knew her. It was kind of fun to play again.

Q. Here? What happened in '97?

JIMIN KANG: It was at the Rolex Junior Championship.

Q. Who won?

JIMIN KANG: I think it was Young-A Yang.

JIMIN KANG: About three -- well, it's close to four years now.

JIMIN KANG: Well, in my country, you cannot do like studying and golfing, both,
together. But when you come in the United States, you can study first and then golf is
second for just activity; right. So my parents are like, well, if you are -- keep staying
in Korea, you have to -- well I'm golfer, which means like all I can do is golfing, not
studying. So like you have to choose between one of those. So my parents said: It's not
fair. You're a teenager, and you need to get some education. Let's go to America so you
can get an education first and then play golf later. So that's why I came here.

JIMIN KANG: I wasn't old enough.

Q. And were you 14 when you came here? Is that what you said earlier?

JIMIN KANG: It was 1997. I was 15.

Q. Do you feel like you're playing real well?

JIMIN KANG: Well, so far I did.

Q. Do you think you're playing well, though? Sometimes you win matches and you don't
play real well, but do you think you're playing good?

JIMIN KANG: I want to complain about lots of stuff, but I'm not going to do it. It's
not going to make them feel better; so I'm just going to keep quite quiet.

Q. How many birdies did you have in this match?

JIMIN KANG: I think I had only two.

Q. Only two?

JIMIN KANG: I didn't keep the score. Sorry 1st hole I birdied and No. 4.

Q. Did you win the 4th hole as well or did she birdie also?

JIMIN KANG: She birdied it.

Q. Any thoughts on tomorrow, what your philosophy will be? What's your game plan?

JIMIN KANG: Same as today. One at a time. Try my best. That's all. We'll see tomorrow.
