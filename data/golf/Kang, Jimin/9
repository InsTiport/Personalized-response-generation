JOEL LAMP:  We've got the winner, Jimin Kang, in here, fresh with a set of roses and a nice glass bowl to celebrate her win.  Let's start off with your score card.  Go ahead, just birdies and bogeys.
JIMIN KANG:  No. 1, I made a par.

No. 2, I made a birdie.
JOEL LAMP:  Let's talk about it for a second.  What did you have in there?  What did you have to get on in two?
JIMIN KANG:  I got on in three.  I laid up.  My second shot on No. 2, I hit a 4 iron and it went into the left bunker about 17, 18 yards.  I had to hit it up and let it roll to get it closer, about 6 foot, 5 foot for the birdie.
JOEL LAMP:  Next birdie?
JIMIN KANG:  No. 5, par 5, I hit a driver and I hit a 4 iron.  Yes, I hit a 4 iron.  It went short of the green and chipped it to about three feet, made a birdie there.
JOEL LAMP:  No bogeys anywhere?
JIMIN KANG:  Not yet.  It's coming.
JOEL LAMP:  Birdie on 8.
JIMIN KANG:  No. 8, par 4, I hit a driver, hit a 52, gripped it and hit it a little bit past the hole.  It rolled all the way back to about a four footer uphill, left to right, made the putt.

No. 9, I teed off with a 5 wood.  I hit a 7 iron about 150 yards, and I kind of pulled it left on the edge, and I putted and it went in.
JOEL LAMP:  About how far?
JIMIN KANG:  Good question.  About six feet, seven feet, eight feet.
JOEL LAMP:  By the end of the day it will be a 40 footer, won't it?
JIMIN KANG:  Maybe.
JOEL LAMP:  10.
JIMIN KANG:  Here is the bogey.  Happy?  (Laughter).  Driver, I totally pushed it to the left.  It went into the bunker and I hit a bunker shot.  It went left of the green, totally downslope, hit the chip shot, knocked it on, didn't make the putt, about 5 foot uphill, right to left, and I missed the putt.
JOEL LAMP:  Birdies, what was the next one?
JIMIN KANG:  No. 12, par 5, driver, 3 wood fat, about 35 yards uphill, I had to let it roll about 45 yards.  Chipped it three feet past the hole, downhill, right to left, made the putt for birdie.

I got another bogey for you.  No. 14, the par 5.  I knocked it on, four footer, five footer, close, left to the right, and I hit that putt really aggressive, it hit the hole cup, came out to about 3 foot and I pulled my putter.  I had 3 putts, made a bogey.
JOEL LAMP:  What did you hit to get on?
JIMIN KANG:  No. 12?
JOEL LAMP:  14.
JIMIN KANG:  I think I gripped an 8 iron.
JOEL LAMP:  You hit the 8 iron to four feet for birdie?
JIMIN KANG:  Yes.
JOEL LAMP:  Missed the birdie?
JIMIN KANG:  Yes.
JOEL LAMP:  But you recover with the ace at 15.
JIMIN KANG:  Tell me about it.
JOEL LAMP:  No, you tell us about it.
JIMIN KANG:  No. 15, Meena Lee made a birdie putt, I went second.  She hit a great shot.  She hit to five feet short of the pin.  And I told her, "That's a little bit short, huh?"  She didn't respond.  Maybe she didn't understand me.  It's a tournament.  Nobody really pays attention to what people say.
JOEL LAMP:  What did you hit in there?
JIMIN KANG:  Be patient.  I gripped a 9 iron.  I gripped it a lot.  Yeah, gripped a 9 iron, hit it solid, and I think it bounced, one bounce in, twice, I couldn't tell.  You wonder why I wear glasses.
JOEL LAMP:  Then it was pars the rest of the way in, right?
JIMIN KANG:  No, I hit a birdie on No. 16.
JOEL LAMP:  Birdie on 16.
JIMIN KANG:  I hit a 3 iron, I gripped another 9 iron, hit it low, I gripped it a lot, and I knocked it to about 12 feet, downhill, right to left, and it went in for birdie.

Then parred the rest all the way coming home.
JOEL LAMP:  Congratulations on the win.  What are your thoughts right now, having gotten your first career PGA victory now, in dramatic fashion?
JIMIN KANG:  No kidding.  Honestly, I'm trying to feel it.  Okay, I just won the tournament, I looked at the score board, my name is at the top of the leaderboard and it's not coming yet.  I hope it comes soon.  Once the check goes into my bank, I might feel it. (Laughter.)

JOEL LAMP?  Questions?

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  No. 14, I just keep talking to myself, I keep mumbling to myself on the back of the left corner of the green, "Jimin, it's okay.  It's only golf.  It' only a game.  I can do the 3 putts.  It's fine.  Just move on.  Just putt it.  It will be fine."  That's what I said, and I think it worked.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  You know, actually I didn't really think about winning, because I couldn't see the score board, but that's excitement, you know.  I have to 3 putt for the bogey and holding on during the tournament.  I'm like, man, it must be my day.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  Actually, I thought about it last night.  I was hoping I didn't look up at the score boards.  Today, I think I was a little busy playing to look up.  It must be a good thing.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  No. 17, on the green.  There is a board.  I saw my name and her name is at the top.  I thought, "Oh, my gosh, I'm at the top."
Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I always go with the 3 wood there, because I hit it far enough, I think.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  Not much.  I told you, I was too busy playing my own game today.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I think I had enough fun today.  Can't you tell?

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I'm not a rookie.  This is my third year.  I tried to play, because I had a nonexempt status in 2003 and 2004, so I tried to play in 2003 and it didn't work out that way.  So I decided to play the Futures Tour so I could play more events, and earn my status from there for the Q School.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I guess I look younger than my age, huh?  I'm 25 years old.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  Thank you.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I guess this is really great encouragement that I see myself with the hope that I can play some golf.  I just want to see    I just love being out here.  Seriously, I just love to play golf, especially competing with all these ladies.  It's a blessing, I love it.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I think it depends how they grow up, the different culture.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I don't think it was this.  I think I was just jumping around.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I don't think I want to see that.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I don't know.  It's just me.  Because I was like that when I was in Korea, too.  Since I came to the States, it's developed more.  That's just how I am.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  When I was in Korea I was more quiet.  Since I came to the States, I think I started to go more outgoing, easy going.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  It's definitely encouraging.  I won.  What do you expect?  You don't know until you sign the score card and turn it in.  Nobody really expected that I would win, I'm pretty sure.  It's like, "Surprise, you won the whole thing."
Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  Because nobody really saw it.  I was the only one who saw it.  If I want to play well, I have to go, you know what, my ball moved, I want a rules official.  I want to make it clear it was there.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  It's okay.  I'll make it up sometime.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  Definitely.  I was like, Oh, she pushed her driver.  I just have to get a par here.

Q.  (What do you think about the media attention)
JIMIN KANG:  I love it.  I love people around me.  I love galleries cheering me.  I love it.  I really enjoy it.

Q.  (No microphone.)
JIMIN KANG:  I didn't know.  Good to know.  Like I say, it's golf.  She is a great golfer, but it's not a guarantee she is going to win.  She may do her best to win.  But who knows, it's golf, right?
JOEL LAMP:  Thanks a lot.
