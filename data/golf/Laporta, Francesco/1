 Q.  Rounds of 67 and 68. Very different conditions it seems out there. What was the difference between playing on this course in those two days?  
FRANCESCO LAPORTA: Yesterday was a lot of wind and today actually was a bit different, the wind. It was from another direction. I was expecting like less wind this morning, but it was windy. Some holes play longer, and the course is in beautiful condition. Played solid both, two rounds, and now hope for another good weekend.   
 Q.  When you look at the two ways it's been set up the last couple of weeks, Dubai with the setup, the rough, what the tour went for, the style of course, and this one this week, which one do you prefer, and why?  
FRANCESCO LAPORTA: Actually I didn't play in Dubai. Actually I was second reserve.   
I tried the course. It was really tough.   
Actually I prefer this course. You have to hit it pretty straight from the tee shot. The greens are not easy to read it. So I think this is why the score is not low. I definitely prefer this one.   
 Q.  Your career, it's an amazing achievement what happened the end of last year, the two late wins to be No. 1 on The Challenge Tour, and now starting your season out here, what's the biggest difference between the tours?  
FRANCESCO LAPORTA: Actually the course are pretty different. On The Challenge Tour, the course are much more shorter. Like perfect for my game because I don't need to drive it that far. You can really feel the difference, and so many good players. You have to play very good, and every shot counts here. Yeah, it's a big difference compared to The Challenge Tour.
