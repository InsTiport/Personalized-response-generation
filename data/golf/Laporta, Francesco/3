 Q.  The afternoon play seemed to be a little bit harder for the field. Certainly not according to your scorecard today, with a second round 63. Was it as easy as you made it look?  
FRANCESCO LAPORTA: I played solid. I played solid all 18 holes. My putting was solid, my driver, my irons. I gave myself a lot of opportunity for birdies, and so when I had the opportunities, I took it. Every time I was putting for birdie, I made it. It was a great day.   
 Q.  You nearly had a-hole-in-one on the back nine amongst your five birdies coming in on the last five holes.  
FRANCESCO LAPORTA: Yeah, and nearly a 2 on 16. I made 2 yesterday. Yeah, it was a great day, and every one was looking perfect.   
 Q.  A winner on The Challenge Tour this year, being here at a Rolex Series Event, how does it feel to be amongst The European Tour?  
FRANCESCO LAPORTA: Feeling good. Yeah, two years ago, so this year it's different. On The Challenge Tour I got more opportunity to play, so that was good. I didn't start the season good. I missed the cut in South Africa two times, and this is the third event and I'm leading, so I just want to enjoy the weekend.
