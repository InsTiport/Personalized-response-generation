 Q. Talk about 18. 
 STEVE MARINO: I hit a pretty good drive. And found a tight bunker. I didn't have much of a stance. I didn't want to just explode it out of there, because I wanted to get somewhat close to the green and have a shot. And I tried to go for it, and it hit the lip and then it went like nowhere. 
 I thought I hit a great third shot in there, and it just came off like half a club short in that bunker, and that was it. 

 Q. Talk about the rest of the day? 
 STEVE MARINO: Yeah, I played pretty good. I made a sloppy putt, three-putt bogey on 12, and missed a short putt on 13. But other than that, I hit the ball great. Played really well. 
 And I holed that bunker, that chip shot on 16. And all of a sudden I was there in the mix. You know, I just wish 18 would have turned out a little different. But I played well, and I can keep my head high. 

 Q. What did you think when you went to the 18 tee? 
 STEVE MARINO: I was thinking of just bombing it down there, and trying to knock it out in two. I hit a pretty good drive. You know, it just took kind of a bad kick, and it went all the way up to the top of the bunker and rolled back down. I just had nothing in there.
