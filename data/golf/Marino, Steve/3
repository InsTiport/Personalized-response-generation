Q. Off to a great start.  12 points today.  Just a few comments about the highlights of the round.
STEVE MARINO: Yeah, I just played pretty solid.  I was able to avoid bogeys.  I had two.  But just played pretty solid.  A lot of fairways.  I chipped it well.  I got up-and-down nice.  And some holes I hit it pretty close, was able to make the putts.
Q. How much does aggression come into play in an event with a format like this?
STEVE MARINO: I think in years past when I played here, I was like:  I'm going to be real aggressive and it just didn't really work out for me.  So I think I'm just going to try to play like I normally play.  I wasn't trying to think about points.  I was just trying to think about making birdies and avoiding bogeys.
Q. How about the altitude, how much do you have to pull back on the throttle?
STEVE MARINO: 10 percent pretty much.  Can't be more.  Early in the morning it might have been a little less.  But 10 percent's a pretty good number to play.
