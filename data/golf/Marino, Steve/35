   STEVE MARINO: I just try to do the best I can and that's all you can do. You can't control what other guys are doing. But obviously when Tiger and Phil are playing, you have to figure they are going to play well, so that makes you focus. You know you are going to have to make some birdies and shoot a good score to stay within reach of them.  
 I sure didn't think a 64 was out there, that's for sure. But it could be out there or even better for Zach. I think anything in the 60s on this course is pretty damn good playing.  
 I didn't putt as well as I did yesterday. I had two three-putts and missed a couple of short putts on 16 and 17. I just didn't get much out of the round today. I hit my driver better today and I hit a lot of fairways. But I got off to a bad start in being 2 over after three holes, but I hung in there. It could have really been bad. When you start going bad out here, if you don't keep it in check it can get real bad.  
 I knew I had a couple par 5s still left on the front and my goal was just to get it back to even through nine or 10 and then just take it from there. I did that too. I got it back to even at 10 and then made two more birdies.  
 You have to make something happen on the front, but I've actually scored better on the back this week, so go figure. Hopefully tomorrow I can play well on the front.
