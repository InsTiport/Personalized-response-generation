  Q. That just played tough out there, didn't it?  
 STEVE MARINO: It did. It really, really firmed up. That 17 green, I don't know how you hit the green there. I hit a really good shot in there and it just landed like it landed on concrete. It was tough. It was tough. It wasn't really that windy but the wind got tricky in spots, and I'm pretty happy with 71.   
  
  Q. Tell me about that bunker shot at 17. A lot of guys step in the bunker and think, this is a hole-able shot. That wasn't one of those, though?  
 STEVE MARINO: No, it was pretty tough. The only thing I was thinking about was just try to hit it out as soft as I can and hope it hits the pin, and it did and went in.   
  
  Q. What was the difference in the course between Friday and today?   
 STEVE MARINO: Just the greens got real, real firm, and yesterday I played in the morning, so the greens were pretty smooth and late in the afternoon, they got kind of bumpy and got kind of beat up and they were just so firm and fast. Even two-foot putts were a little dicey out there.  
  
  Q. After a round like this, do you feel like you've been in a 15-round fight?  
 STEVE MARINO: A little bit. A little bit. It was a grind out there. But I closed strong. Made some good up-and-downs, holed that bunker shot on 17 so I'm pretty happy.  
 If we have similar conditions tomorrow than we did today -- the greens got real firm and if you're not on top of it, you can get in trouble in a hurry out there.   
  
  Q. When do you know it's your time?   
 STEVE MARINO: I don't know, when it happens, I'll tell you. I'm not sure. I'm just trying to do the same things I've been doing. Today I wasn't hitting some great shots at the end but was able to make some nice up-and-downs and holed a bunker shot on 17. I'm just going to try to keep doing what I'm doing.
