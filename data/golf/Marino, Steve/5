  STEVE MARINO:   I played pretty good.   I made an unfortunate double on 17.   I'm trying to get that out of my head right now.   I played a really good tournament.   
    Well, I'm going home next week.   I'll take some positives out of this week.   It's been a long time since I played.   I had a nice finish, so, you know, I'll just go home and try to iron out my driver a little bit.   I was spraying it all over the place.   I'll be ready to come back out for Pebble.  
   
 Q.   Does it make you feel good that you can accomplish this this year?   
    STEVE MARINO:   Yeah.   I felt like I was going to be okay coming back.   I play with a bunch of guys at home that play out here, and I can hold my own with them.   So I wasn't really worried about not being able to play anymore.   
    But it is nice to come out and have a good tournament.   That's for sure.
