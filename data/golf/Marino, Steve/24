   STEVE MARINO: It was a great day today. I played really, really well. I wish I could have made the putt on 18, but other than that, I played great. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEVE MARINO: You know, I just really didn't put myself in any bad positions. I hit a couple bad shots but kind of got lucky, and they ended up okay. Just played real, real consistent tee to green and made a couple putts.

 Q. The last couple years you've just knocked on the door so many times, wouldn't it be a great day to break that door down? 
 STEVE MARINO: Yeah, absolutely, TOUR Championship, season-ending event with a great field. It would be awesome.

 Q. Talk about this haircut. Wow, you really buzzed it all off. 
 STEVE MARINO: Yeah, I did. My hats don't fit me anymore. It was just too long. I figured I'd shave it all off and start from scratch.
