  Q. It seems as though from time to time from watching on television, did the pace of play bother you coming down the stretch?  
 STEVE MARINO: Not really. I knew it was going to be a long day out there. I don't know how long it took us to play. It had to be close to six hours. But I knew what we were getting into today so didn't really bother me.  
  
  Q. Explain if you can from your vantage point what happened after D.A. chips in on 14 and you saw the scoreboard change?  
 STEVE MARINO: Well, I didn't know he chipped in on 14 until I played 14 and looked at the board and saw at that point he was one ahead of me and then I saw him make that putt on 15. And yeah, I was trying to make birdies coming down the stretch. I was playing well and hit some good shots. He played great to shoot 4-under on the back side, he deserved to win.  
  
  Q. And on 18, what happened?  
 STEVE MARINO: Well, I tried to kind of finesse my drive down there and get it left of the trees and get it out to the right and we had nothing out of the bunker. We had 200 yards to the hole, and I knew I was two back so I was trying to hold my 4-iron and I just pulled it and hit it in the water and after that, it was -- kind of the wind was out of my sails. I fought so hard today and felt like I played pretty good and just didn't work out for me. It was kind of, the last hole, knowing you're fighting so hard to win, doesn't happen, it's kind of a bummer.
