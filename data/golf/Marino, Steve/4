 Q.  Always nice to end with an 11-foot par putt.  
STEVE MARINO: Thanks a lot.  You know, that was pretty much my only risk of bogey all day, so it was nice to make that putt to finish.   
 Q.  Did you arrive here disappointed or with optimism?  
STEVE MARINO: With optimism.  I played well last week.  Obviously it was disappointing to lose the playoff, but I did the best I could and it's just something I'm finally starting to play well again.   
 Q.  You have really had an unusual career on the PGA TOUR.  You've been a star, you've gone through injuries, you lost your exemption, battling your way back.  How is the patience?  
STEVE MARINO: It's been good, you know.  I kept a good head about me throughout that whole time and just tried to persevere and work through it, and I think I'm finally coming out on the other side.   
 Q.  Coming off a great day.  You're off to a good start here.  
STEVE MARINO: Thank you.
