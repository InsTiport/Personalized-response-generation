  Q. Can you talk about the huge galleries, very boisterous?  
 STEVE MARINO: Yeah, it was a little bit more boisterous than yesterday. They got to get a little bit extra sleep last night.  
 So, you know, I still think it's probably going to be mild today compared to what it's going to be tomorrow, and especially Sunday if I continue to play well.  
  
  Q. How do you keep continuing to play well? 70 today but still only four shots off; how did that make you feel?  
 STEVE MARINO: I feel pretty good about it. Obviously would have liked to have played a little bit better today, but even par out here is not awful. I may have left some shots out there, but I did not play as well as I did yesterday.   
 You know, could have been a couple shots worse. Could have been a couple shots better today. But overall, I think even is a fair score for me today.   
  
  Q. Having a lot of support and seeing the leaders at nine, is it hard not to push it?   
 STEVE MARINO: Well, out here, I don't really think you can push it. If you start pressing out here and going for some pins that you shouldn't be going for, that's when those bogeys and double-bogeys, they sneak up and bite you. I mean, this is such a good golf course, you've really got to respect it and just take what you get out here.   
  
  Q. Do you have a number in mind for tomorrow or just keep plugging away and making pars and birdies where you can?  
 STEVE MARINO: I don't think I have a number in mind. I'm just going to go out here and try to be as focused as I can and try to take advantage of the good shots I hit and try to minimize the mistakes.
