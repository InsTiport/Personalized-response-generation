  Q. Good round, you have to be happy overall where you are in the tournament I would imagine in.   
 STEVE MARINO: Absolutely. I think we caught a little bit of a break this afternoon. We teed off on 10, I thought it was just going to be awful out there. We caught a little bit of a break, it wasn't quite as bad as I thought it was going to be.   
 So yeah, I'm real happy with the way I played today. Even par today I thought was pretty good. I didn't play great but I made some nice putts. I'm real excited about the weekend.  
  
  Q. Playing longer with all of the rain, is it weird when you practice on a course for a couple of days and all of a sudden you have way different clubs in your hands and different looks?   
 STEVE MARINO: It's a little bit weird but out here, you have to adjust immediately or you're going to be in trouble. This course, we were talking yesterday how hard this course can play, and it showed its teeth a little bit today.   
  
  Q. Any particular shots in the round that really helped keep momentum going?  
 STEVE MARINO: I think the first two holes, No. 10, I don't know of anybody that teed off around when I did got to the green in two in regulation. I made like a 12-footer for par there, and then on 11 I made about an 18-footer for par.   
 So right off the bat, I'm looking -- most of the time, you're not going to make those putts. So I could have been 2-over after two and instead I'm even. From then on, I kind of settled in and played pretty good.   
  
  Q. Padraig and Sergio talked about having to hit wood into the holes; did you have to hit utilities into any of the par 4s?  
 STEVE MARINO: A couple of the par 4s I hit utilities, but 10, I couldn't even get home. I just laid up with a 5-iron.
