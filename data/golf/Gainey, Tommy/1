 Q.  So an ace on No. 7 today.  Walk us through what happened.  
TOMMY GAINEY: I mean, it was -- what was the yardage?  151 whole.  I hit just a little pitching wedge in there.  And I didn't see it go in, personally, because at that time teeing off at 7:01, we got there kind of pretty early.  It was still covered in shade, the pin was.   
I didn't see it go in, but everybody else did.  It was a good shot.  I didn't know how to react because I didn't see it go in.  But I'm pretty excited about it.  Shots like that don't happen like that every day.   
 Q.  Is this your first ace in a PGA TOUR event?  
TOMMY GAINEY: It is.  This is my first ace in a PGA TOUR event.   
 Q.  How is that?  Is it like any other shot?  
TOMMY GAINEY: It is.  Out here it's all about winning.  When you make a shot like that, it's good to see a lot of people around, get excited about seeing a shot like that because it's not very often do you see that.   
 Q.  And two eagles in your round today.  That helped a lot with the point systems.  What's your strategy like?  Do you play more aggressive with the system or --  
TOMMY GAINEY: Well, my game's always been aggressive.  So I mean the point system fits me to a tee.  I just gotta hit it a little bit better tomorrow and putt it just a little better, and I'll have a bunch of points instead of nine today.
