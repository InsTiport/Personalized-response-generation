  Q. Just talk about the overall experience of playing in the par 3 tournament.   
 DREW WEAVER: It's great. It's one of the things that's a big tradition for the Masters and it's s very cool to be out there, tons of people and excitement and so it was a great day.  
  
  Q. Had you ever come to the event and seen the par 3 before?  
 DREW WEAVER: No, I had been to a couple practice rounds but not the Par 3.  
  
  Q. What were some things that you were anticipating or expecting and did it live up to that?   
 DREW WEAVER: Yeah, it definitely lived up. I expected, you know, there would be a ton of people out here and hit a good shot and you get a great roar so that's very exciting. It was definitely everything I thought it would be and more.   
  
  Q. Any practice rounds on the Par 3?   
 DREW WEAVER: I came over here and it was closed and didn't feel like playing the big course. It was good and helped out a little bit.   
  
  Q. Do you find it was a good tuneup for tomorrow?   
 DREW WEAVER: For sure. Reading the greens helps out, so it's good.
