  Q. Looked like everyone else was running away at the start of the day?  
 PETER HEDBLOM: No, it didn't look that good, but it was fun to be able to play. And playing in one of the last groups, it's fun to be able to play.  
 It's fun out there and it's great and I just love this course and the atmosphere around it, it's a lot of fun.  
  
  Q. Did you look up early and see those guys getting away from you?   
 PETER HEDBLOM: I knew Darren was so many under par, anyways, I just had to play my own game and not try to focus on the other people. Like I said I was just trying to enjoy it and have fun and it was, you know, it's sad, when I made that eagle on 13, that I couldn't get a couple more birdies coming in but still a decent day.  
  
  Q. Do you reckon you have to go low tomorrow?  
 PETER HEDBLOM: Yeah, but I don't know about the weather tomorrow, a little bit more wind. Definitely have to go deep, but at least Edoardo, if he wins, okay; then I can be second and I'll go straight to the British Open.   
  
  Q. You're chasing Darren Clarke for that, what are your thoughts on that, just hope that you have to go low and he doesn't?   
 PETER HEDBLOM: Yeah, I just have to play a little better than today and I think it will be good.
