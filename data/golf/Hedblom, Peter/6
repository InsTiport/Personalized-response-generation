   PETER HEDBLOM: It's really tough. With the weather, the ball was going nowhere. That was one thing that was hard and with the wet weather, it's not easy. I'm so sensible, I get a little water between the fingers, all of the sudden you don't want to hit, you want to go back.   
 I think it actually was one of my best days in the rain in a long, long time, I can't remember, because I was still trying not to swing too hard, get it half a club short less all the time, or more, to get the ball all the way up there?  
  
  Q. You can't enjoy it, but at the same time, you seem to apply yourself very nicely to it.   
 PETER HEDBLOM: Yeah, I did. I mean, I found a way to get around today and I'm very happy to score.  
  
  Q. Bradley Dredge said it's definitely the longest he's known Loch Lomond to play.   
 PETER HEDBLOM: Oh, definitely, yesterday I hit driver, 8-iron into 16 and today I hit driver, 3-wood. That tells you quite a lot there.   
  
  Q. Special to be back in Scotland?   
 PETER HEDBLOM: Yeah, breathing in the Scottish air is good for me I think.   
  
  Q. Well, I don't know if you reflected on the last time you were here?  
 PETER HEDBLOM: Yeah, I've been thinking about that, definitely. The year has not been good, so it's good to get back to Scotland and start playing some good golf.  
  
  Q. Any reason for that, why the years has not been good?  
 PETER HEDBLOM: Probably a million reasons. I've been trying hard but it has not been there. But it's good to start playing good now.  
  
  Q. And keep it going.   
 PETER HEDBLOM: I will try, definitely.   
  
  Q. I don't know if you can put into context what Darren Clarke is doing.   
 PETER HEDBLOM: It's unbelievable to shoot that score today, the way the course is playing. But, you know, he played good Monday, Tuesday, as well, earlier this week, so he's back to his best. It's nice to see.
