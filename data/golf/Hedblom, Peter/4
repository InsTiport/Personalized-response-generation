 Q.   Had a great start and kind of an unusual day for you.   Give us a synopsis of what happened?  
PETER HEDBLOM:   I had a great start.   I started holing a lot of good putts.   Unfortunately the break came.   It was hard to come out after 45 minutes.   I'm not 22 anymore.   So it was tough.   Then it started to get dark and everything.   It was a tricky day.   
   
 Q.   What about the first hole (inaudible)?  
PETER HEDBLOM:   Not really.   I was expecting it.   It was three and a half hours or whatever it was.
