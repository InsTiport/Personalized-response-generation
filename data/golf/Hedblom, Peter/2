 Q.   So what's your take on day, good, satisfying start?   
PETER HEDBLOM:   Yeah, it was good.   It was an interesting day.   The game didn't feel that good, but I kept the ball in the fairways.   I hit a few bad ones and I was lucky to bounce in the fairway, stuff like that.   But a solid start.  
   
 Q.   Is that the whole mark of this course that you have to keep it on the straight and narrow?  
PETER HEDBLOM:   Yeah, exactly.   The driving feels really good.   So just a few bad ones, but that only really two and the rest was good.   
   
 Q.   You'd better tell me about your approach to this week because it's a very important one.   
PETER HEDBLOM:   Yeah, I don't know.   I'm so far back.   I need a win or finish second really.   Well, I mean, you have nothing to hold back.   You just have to go for everything.   You still have to go for everything‑‑ but you're not happy to finish third or fourth or fifth or sixth or 10th.   Just play as good as you can.  
   
 Q.   Where is the tension and where is the anxiety?   What is the level like knowing that you've got to winor not?  
PETER HEDBLOM:   Now it's nothing really.   Today it felt like any tournament when I'm starting.   But now, I mean, good first round, and you know, if I will be leading playing the last day, then maybe I'll feel the tension.   But right now, it's just one round out of four.   But it's good to at least have a chance to do it.   
   
 Q.   There have been signs recently the game is okay.   
PETER HEDBLOM:   Yeah, exactly.   I've been, you know, a few good rounds here and there now, but the game is there.   You just need a little bit of confidence like I said to you the last time we talked.   But just getting there a little bit better, and hopefully we'll get a whole tournament and we'll be back.
