 Q.  So, the Scarlet Course is supposed to be one of the hardest on the WEB.COM TOUR.  Just what were you seeing out there?  
D.A. POINTS: No, it was still pretty difficult.  The greens are softer, like I played here last year and it was really firm and it took really, really precise shots.   
Today you could get to some of the tough pins because of how soft the greens were and that's why you see guys 6- and 7-under par.  But I'm happy with my 2-under.  My back was a little tight this morning and didn't have my maybe my best stuff early on and was able to fight through it and shoot under par.   
 Q.  Do you think your back's going to recover by tomorrow?  
D.A. POINTS: Yeah, it's playable, it's just not, it doesn't feel perfect.  It's not a hundred percent.  It was tight and I couldn't turn through it early and had to really rely on my short game and then finally got it a little loosened up on the back nine and played nice.   
 Q.  You shot a solid round today, but what can you do to improve the next couple days?  
D.A. POINTS: Just continue to give myself some more opportunities, some good looks.  I made some really nice putts earlier and then the putter kind of went cold.  So it's about putting and giving yourself good looks to make putts.
