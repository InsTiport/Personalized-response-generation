Q.   So I asked you about it before, but what is the best shot he hit all week? 
KEVIN BAILE:   That putt, 18, last one.

Q.   What about the drive on 18? 
KEVIN BAILE:   That would be the second best. 

Q.   The approach shot? 
KEVIN BAILE:   He missed it by a couple of yards, but he hit it where his angle was.   He hit great shots all week. 
He's just amazing, how well he can strike the golf ball.   You don't even have to watch where it goes. 

Q.   What about his demeanor going down the stretch? 
KEVIN BAILE:   Same as always, focused. 

Q.   And what are you currently driving?   I guess I should say that you won a Cadillac‑‑
KEVIN BAILE:   I'm driving a 2003 Chevy Tahoe. 

Q.   Excited about the Cadillac? 
KEVIN BAILE:   Yeah!   I've been looking for a new ride in the last couple of weeks.   I know a couple of car salesmen friends that aren't going to be happy. 

Q.   Can you fit a bag in the back of that?
KEVIN BAILE:   I don't play.   I don't need to worry about it.
