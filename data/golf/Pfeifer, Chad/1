Q. So, great playing today.
CHAD PFEIFER:   Thank you.
Q. Obviously getting towards the top of the leaderboard.  How was your round today?
CHAD PFEIFER:   Got off to a slow start.  I think I had two bogeys on the front and just all pars, and then just found a stride there on the back nine.  I think I birdied five of six there for a bit.
And then bogeyed -- put a poor swing on 18's tee shot; bogeyed that.  But for how it started, could have been a lot worse.  Happy I bounced back on the back.
Q. So how much golf have you been playing leading up to this week?
CHAD PFEIFER:   Very little.  You know, weather up in Idaho is not ideal for golf in the wintertime.  Timberstone Golf Club, the course I play out of, has as great performance center and practice facility.  They've got a simulator, so I'm able to at least swing up there.
But short game and putting, you know, when I get back on grass always takes a little bit to get that touch back.  Yeah, just I think the first couple practice rounds I spent a lot of time on that, chipping and putting, so it's helped out.
Q. So any thoughts going into tomorrow?
CHAD PFEIFER:   No.  Just keep playing my game, keep having fun.  This tournament is always a blast.  Mike Flaskey Diamond Resorts do an amazing job with this tournament, and it keeps getting better and better.  We definitely miss the fans out here, but it's still an amazing tournament.
So just keep having fun, keep playing, and keep swinging; try to make some putts.
