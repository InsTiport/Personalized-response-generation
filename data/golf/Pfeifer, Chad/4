Q. Chad, you had three birdies out there today.  How fun was it out there today?
CHAD PFEIFER: It was a lot of fun out there.  Derek played great, and he was a lot of fun to be around.  And then watching Nelly play all day was just -- I mean, she played phenomenal, played great.  I think she shot a 67 or 65, something like that.  It was good.  Too many birdies to keep track of.
But just the atmosphere here at this tournament is always so much fun.  Diamond does such an incredible job with this tournament, and it was a great day.
Q. Some of the LPGA players have talked about being inspired by you.  How fun is it to be out here playing with them this week?
CHAD PFEIFER: It's a lot of fun.  It means a lot to me to hear them say that because my goal in kind of playing golf is just to help inspire other people with disabilities, but if I'm helping these girls or anybody to be in the game of golf and see me play, that's just an added bonus.
It's a lot of fun playing with these girls out here, and from what I've gathered from them, they're having a great time this week too.  So it's a lot of fun.
Q. Now that you're at the top of the leaderboard, tomorrow are you going to focus down and try to win it, or will you still have fun out there and be relaxed?
CHAD PFEIFER: Yeah, I think that's part of the reason I've been playing so good is because I've been relaxed and having fun.  Tomorrow I'm just going to go out and stick to the game plan and have fun and try to get birdies.  But with this new scoring format, you're not going to kill yourself getting a bunch of pars and throwing a few birdies, and you'll be just fine.  I'll just go back out and keep to the game plan.
