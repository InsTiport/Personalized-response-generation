Q.   Okay.   So slightly frustrating round.   Could I just have your reactions?
LINDA WESSBERG:   Oh, you don't want to know.   Well, you know, I started off with a birdie on the second hole and then three‑putted on 4, very fast greens today in the morning.   Also three‑putted on 5, so I took a double there. 
Came back, though, in the middle of the round and I was very pleased with that and then I finished with two bogeys on the last two holes.

Q.   But overall you're still in quite a good position.   I think you're two off the lead despite today.   I mean you must be pretty pleased today the position you're in if you take a step back?
LINDA WESSBERG:   Well, I mean maybe if you ask me in a few hours, I would probably be pretty pleased, but right now I'm not very happy.

Q.   But the afternoon group may not score so well, so I think probably at the end of the day you will still be in the Top 5.   I mean heading into the final two days, it's a good position to be in, surely?
LINDA WESSBERG:   It is, yes.   But it's really hard coming off there with two bogeys on the last two holes.   So it's frustrating right now, but you know, I'll be working on it.
