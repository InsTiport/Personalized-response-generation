 THE MODERATOR: You finished third last week. You must be feeling very confident.  
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: Yeah. I'm really confident. I played really well then, and the week before as well. And I didn't play last week. So I practiced all, and I really enjoy the play and on the Links golf course as well.

  Q. When you set out this morning, did you have any goals in mind or are you quite surprised that you find yourself at the top of the leaderboard?  
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: Yeah. Maybe a little bit. I'm really confident, so I know I can do it.   
  
  Q. Have you had any help from people like Thomas Levet or any of the other French men golfers?  
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: No. No, no. I didn't talk with them. But it's good to ask the players, like Thomas. They play good. So the French players can play good. French girls are good too.  
 THE MODERATOR: Can you go through the bogeys and birdies for us. You started with a bogey at first.

 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: I don't remember.  
 THE MODERATOR: Did you drive the dogleg around the corner?   
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: Yeah. And I hit 8-iron, shot off the pin, and I made a six meters for birdie.  
 THE MODERATOR: The par-5, 6, you birdied.  
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: Yeah. And driver 3-wood, like 30 meters to the pin, like 58 meters. And I made like one meter for birdie.  
 THE MODERATOR: And the other hole you birdied, par-4.  
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: I hit driver and then 7-iron. And I had four meters for birdie.  
 THE MODERATOR: And finished with a birdie at the last.

  Q. Are there any other golfers in your family?  
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: No. I'm the only one.  
  
  Q. Had they even heard of golf when you came out and said I want to play golf. When you told your father you were going to try to make your profession as a professional golfer.   
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: Yeah. There was a bit of surprise. We lived close to one golf course, so it was easier for my parents. And they just said, yeah, okay, whatever you want. If you want to play golf, it's okay.   
  
  Q. What are your dreams? Your dream is to play in America?  
 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: Yeah. I would love to play in America. But I don't know when. Maybe I'm going to go next year for the qualifying.

 ANNE-LISE CAUDAL: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Is that normal in France or is it just because of the area you were living in?

  Q. So is there other special academies in France for young girls to learn golf or the specific ways of doing it?
