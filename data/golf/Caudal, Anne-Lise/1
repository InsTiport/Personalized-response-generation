Q.   Assessment of your day? 
ANNE‑LISE CAUDAL:   I missed only four greens, so I'm quite happy with my day. 

Q.   Is this a place you enjoy coming to and a course you enjoy playing on, and does it suit your game, as well? 
ANNE‑LISE CAUDAL:   Yeah, it's very nice.   The golf course, it's always in good condition, and then the weather is pretty nice, as well.   So yeah, we enjoy to come here. 

Q.   You're getting more and more experience of being towards the top of the leaderboard, particularly in the last couple of years.   Does it feel comfortable now?   It's a good start to the week for you?
ANNE‑LISE CAUDAL:   Yeah, of course, I'm feeling more comfortable every week and every year with the experience.   So I hope I'm going to do well this week. 

Q.   It's a tough week, obviously there are quite a few big players here; do you still feel confident that you can stay up there this weekend? 
ANNE‑LISE CAUDAL:   Yeah, of course, I have to stay focused on my game and not to think too much about the result or the score.   But I think it's a good chance for us to have these good players playing this week.   So, yeah, I'm going to try to do my best and to be on the top on Sunday‑‑ Saturday, sorry.
