Q. 6-under 65, a lovely way to start here at the Shriners Open.
SHANE BERTSCH: Absolutely.  I'll take it every day.  I mean, I had to do some late night work with my coach last night.  He came in yesterday evening and we did a little work almost under the lights, and started feeling my swing a little bit better and played pretty steady and dropped a couple longish putts, and it worked out.  Starting to get more and more comfortable.
Q. What were the changes that you needed to make and that ended up giving you this good round?
SHANE BERTSCH: It's just setup changes usually almost all the time with me, and I've been searching for it and searching for it for a good month and a half.  Throughout the Web.com Playoffs I was searching and really kind of struggling, playing on the cut line all the time.  Last week was much of the same, even though I managed to make the cut.  But I worked on it hard this week and didn't really feel like I had it -- I knew I didn't have it where I should have it, but late night session last night helped a lot.
Q. Given that, how pleasing is it to go hit a few high-quality golf shots and make the putts?
SHANE BERTSCH: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, yeah, you've got to make the putts.  I did miss some short ones today, but I made up for it with some 30-footers, which was nice.
