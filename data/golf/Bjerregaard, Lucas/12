 Q.  67, that seems to be a score you enjoy shooting when it's really windy out there.  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, today was a lot better.  I think last week hit me a little bit yesterday.  It was a busy few days and maybe didn't manage my time quite well enough.  So yesterday wasn't great.  Made some silly mistakes and felt like my head was really -- wasn't where it was supposed to be.  But a lot better today, and yeah, it all started on 15 when I holed a 7-iron slam dunk.  I've never done that before, and it kind of started there.  Yeah, it was -- back nine especially I made some good up-and-downs but hit some solid shots, as well.   
 Q.  After that hole you didn't drop a shot.  What was the key?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: My chipping was a lot better.  Yesterday I don't think I got up-and-down once.  Today I made some good saves when I was in trouble and stuff.  Yeah, mainly short game.  Didn't putt great, but it's tough when greens are this fast and it's this windy out.  I really struggle with that.   
 Q.  It was really windy when you won in Scotland, very windy again today.  Why do you think your game suits this test of golf?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: I don't know.  I've always enjoyed it.  Probably more so than when it's 25 degrees and no wind at all.  I enjoy this where you have to be a bit creative and really grind it out.  Yeah, I just enjoy it, even though it was very cold at 7:00 this morning.   
 Q.  Given the conditions, do you think that score is going to be pretty good come the end of play today?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, it's tough out there.  I'm happy with the round today.  Obviously yesterday wasn't quite what I was looking for, but really happy with the round today, and hopefully I won't be too far back for the weekend.
