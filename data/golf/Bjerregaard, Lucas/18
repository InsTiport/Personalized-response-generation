Q. No dropped shots and a 65, you must be delighted.
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Very much so.  I've not had much success around this place.  But played lovely today.  Hit it pretty well off the tee.  Hit a couple of loose shots in the end but managed to get up-and-down a couple of times, but all in all, yeah, didn't do much wrong.  So got maybe a little bit of a lucky break on 18 there but nice to finish up with a 4, and yeah, very pleased.
Q. What's the key around this golf course to shooting low scores?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: I don't know.  As you said, I haven't had much success around this place, so didn't really know.  It's important to hit the fairways and the greens, I think, with it being a bit wet, as well, the rough is quite -- well, it's no fun to be there.
It's quite important to hit it straight, and I felt like I did that.  I put myself in a lot of good spots and left myself with a few short irons and took advantage of that.
Q. You had three great events last year, which saw you winning in Portugal, and fifth and sixth in your last two events.  Could this be third time lucky here, massive event, first event in the Rolex Series?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: I'd obviously love that but there's a long way to go.  I'm just pleased that my form from the last few weeks seems to continue and hopefully I can keep doing some of the same stuff the rest of the week.
Q. Early start tomorrow, so maybe some different conditions to deal with but will it be pretty much more of the same or are there one or two things you might change?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: I was pretty pleased.  As I said, I put a few bad swings in the end, so just going to hit five shots and just make sure I'm back to where I need to be.  But other than that, no, didn't do much wrong.  More of the same.
