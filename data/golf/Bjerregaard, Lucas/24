LUCAS BJERREGAARD: I played with Sergio and Thongchai.  They played great golf.  Thongchai obviously got off to a great start and Sergio made some birdies coming in.  They played great and I thought I played decent out there.  Couldn't really get the putts to fall.  I think I had a lot of near makes, but all in all a good day.  Yeah, just got to make a couple more putts tomorrow.  I thought hit a couple of bad iron shots off to the left, saved par most of the time, so yeah, got to make some more putts tomorrow and hit it a little bit closer to keep up with these guys.   
 Q.  It's what we often say, it's not bad if that's your bad day, is it?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: No, not at all.  I didn't think I played bad, so just didn't really get too much out of the round.  But hopefully I'll play a little bit better tomorrow and make a few putts, as well.   
 Q.  Very positive about the way you're playing this golf course; does it suit you?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, I think I played decent today.  Would have been nice to make a couple more, but I'm confident for tomorrow.  It was nice playing with Thongchai and Sergio, great guys, and we had good fun out there today, so looking forward to tomorrow.
