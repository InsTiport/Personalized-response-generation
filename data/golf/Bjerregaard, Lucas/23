 Q.  You have played well across the course of this week.  What are your thoughts on the way it's panned out?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Obviously I would have liked to finish one shot better.  It looks like it's going to be a playoff.  Would have loved to be in that.  Hit a great drive on 18.  Just got really caught on a downhill lie in between numbers.  Just hit a bad shot there unfortunately.   
Played all right at times today.  I thought I played better on the front nine.  Again, it was like yesterday, didn't make the putts that I did Thursday, Friday.  Thought I hit a lot of good putts.  Just, yeah, not really made the putts that I did the first two rounds.   
 Q.  I take it knowing that your playing partners were right up there, you knew exactly what you had to do and how the nip and tuck of that leaderboard was all day.  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, definitely.  They both played great.  Patrick was kind of a couple behind and he made that third shot on 15, was an unbelievable -- his short game today has been great.  Yeah, they both played really well, and yeah, wish them both luck in the playoff.   
 Q.  Do you take defeat very hard or do you get so many positives out of it pretty quickly?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: It doesn't feel good right now.  I feel like playing well the last few months, I'm better when I'm in contention now than I was previous.  So I feel like I had a good chance out there today.  So right now, it doesn't feel great, but all in all, it's still a good week.
