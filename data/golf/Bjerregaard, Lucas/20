 Q.  Can we get your thoughts on a round of 4-under today?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, played really well to be honest.  I hit a couple loose drives on the front nine and couldn't really get anything going, but 1-under, and then had a horrible 3-putt on 8.   
So even par on the front nine there, hit a lot of good shots and didn't really get anything going.  But then, yeah, things kicked off a little bit on the back nine.  Hit two good shots.  Easy birdie on 10.  Hit it close on 13.  Yeah, played really solid.  Obviously the wind picked up a good bit, so it's not easy out there.   
But yeah, made a couple of good par saves, as well, to keep the round going.   
 Q.  You mentioned the wind.  Obviously it's picked up a lot more from yesterday.  Put in quite a good score.  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: I'm pleased.  It was nice this morning and didn't really take advantage of that, but it's a lot trickier than yesterday, that's for sure.  I think you'll see scoring is a bit different.   
Unusual; I've been here three or four times, and I haven't seen this course play like it did yesterday.  This is more what we're used to.   
 Q.  Going into the weekend, you must be fairly pleased with your position?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, it's nice.  I've made the cut the last couple weeks, but haven't really played well.   Got my coach here this week.  We've done some good work early on.  So seeing a lot of good stuff to build on.  It's nice to shoot a couple decent rounds, and hopefully that can continue this weekend.
