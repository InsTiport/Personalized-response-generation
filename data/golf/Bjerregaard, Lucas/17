Q. Three birdies in a row, ideal way to respond after the first,
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, I hit a bad tee shot off the first into the bunker.  Couldn't get to the green and made a 5 there.
Obviously not the best way to start but then hit it to a foot I think on the second and a couple feet on 3, and then 2-putt birdie on 4, which was nice, and got me a little calm.  Then pretty quiet for the rest of the front nine.
I hit some okay shots but didn't really get it close, and then, let's see, where did I get one, on 10, got a putt to drop.  I missed a few putts there on the front nine.  Hit it close on 11 and then up-and-down on 12 for birdie.  Then a nice putt again on 13.  It was really good.  It was solid today.  It wasn't in trouble much.  Hit it great off the tee.  It was a nice way to finish the week.
Q. So 65 to finish, you and started with a 65 on Thursday, as well.  So clearly the game is in good shape at the moment.
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: It is.  It's been very solid all week.  I didn't putt great Friday and Saturday.  Yeah, just didn't really get up-and-down when I needed to and kind of killed momentum a little bit where Thursday and today were a lit better.
Game is getting there.  It's been really solid this week and I'm really pleased with that, so looking forward to this next stretch of big events.
Q. Obviously being a Rolex Series Event, lots of ranking points up for grabs and big event in the Series coming up in the next few weeks?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, Italy next week, looking forward to that, a course that I don't think a lot of us really know anything about.  It will be fun to go down there and see what that's like, but yeah, it's been a really good week and I'm taking a lot of positives and a lot of confidence from here.  So looking forward to Italy next week.
