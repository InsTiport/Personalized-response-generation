 Q.  How would you assess your work out there?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Pretty happy with it. Obviously a shame to finish with a bogey on 17 and then not take advantage of 18. But other than that, played lovely. Made some good putts today, which I did on Thursday, and didn't quite make them yesterday. So that was nice to get that going a bit.   
But yeah, all in all, played pretty solid.   
 Q.  Calmer conditions out here than yesterday?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: No, I think actually it was nicer yesterday. It's a little different wind than we are used to here at the Old Course. Front nine normally plays really easy, and it played a lot harder today.   
But then luckily you make the turn and play the back nine downwind which is nice.   
 Q.  Moving on to tomorrow, how special is it playing the Old Course on Sunday?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, it's always great. I'll be happy doing that and hopefully I can shoot a good number tomorrow.   
 Q.  What sort of emotions do you feel coming down 18 at the Old Course on a Sunday?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: A lot of emotions. It's pretty special. You realize how special a place it is. A lot of people feel a bit of pressure. It's one of the widest fairways in the world, so you don't want to hit it out-of-bounds.   
A few things going through your head up that hole, but you know, it's a cool feeling walking up there and nice to see all the people out today.
