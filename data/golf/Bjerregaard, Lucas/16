Q. A 65, how does that make you feel?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Very good.  I played solid.  I didn't have to fight for my par too much out there.  Got off to a good start.  Birdied the first and the third.  Yeah, it was very good.  We had an enjoyable day, all four of us, played with some nice guys.  So yeah, very good.
Q. Different course to yesterday and different conditions.  What was that like to play?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Completely different.  It was tough yesterday.  I thought putting was tough.  You had to account for the wind.  I had a few, that you think there would be a little left-to-right and they were right-to-left because of the wind.  I thought St. Andrews, we had wind across every hole.  We didn't have one hole downwind or into the wind.  It was quite tough this morning.  We had absolutely no wind this morning.  It was ideal.  It was nice to get off to a fast start because you know around here when there's not much, you have to post a few birdies.
Q. Any that stuck out?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: A good one on 8, my 17th.  Holed a nice putt from just the back of the green.  I played nice.  Had a couple good chances on 5 and 6 -- 4 and 5 that that I take advantage of but then made three in a row on 6,7 and 8.  Nice way to close out the day.
