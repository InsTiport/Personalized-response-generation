 Q.  What was the key out there?  Putting?  Driving?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, I've been driving it better these last couple days.  And then it's my iron play is a big thing for me right now.  On the first nine, I hit some good irons and setup a few birdies there.  Then I didn't hit it close enough on the back nine there to really make anything.   
Yeah, so I need to go hit a few balls, but all in all, it's improving.   
 Q.  Is the aim to get in the Top 60 this week?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: I'm trying my hardest.  First of all, I want to go to Turkey and then play my way through there.  I'm trying all I can and hopefully have a good weekend around here.  It would be nice to get in the Top 60 now but if not then it would be nice just to get to Turkey and then try to play my way into the last few events there.
