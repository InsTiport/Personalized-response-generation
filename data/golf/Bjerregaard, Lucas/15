 Q.  Give us your assessment.  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, it was a bit more of a struggle today.  Carnoustie is a bit tougher than the two other courses, so I know it was going to be a little bit harder, but we had perfect conditions.  It's pretty accessible today.  But yeah, a lot of good in it, and just too many mistakes.  Too many bogeys, really.  I made plenty of birdies.  So yeah, struggled a bit with reading the greens I thought.   
But yeah, it's all right.  I'm in a good position still.  So yeah, looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  Four back.  How do you approach tomorrow?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Well, forecast looks interesting, so I don't think you probably have to make a whole lot of birdies tomorrow.  I think you've got to go out there and stick to the game plan and just make the best of it.
