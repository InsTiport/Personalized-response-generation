 Q.  What are your thoughts on starting with a 66?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: It was nice to get off to a good start.  I was home last week and didn't play much golf.  Unpacked my golf bag on Friday, so just a little bit of practise on Saturday.   
But yeah, it was nice to get going again and played pretty solid, at least the front nine, hit a couple of bad drives coming in, but managed to save par on those holes.  All in all a good day.   
 Q.  And a nice par save at the last, wasn't it, after slinging one in there.  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, again hit a bad drive down in the bunker and had to cut one over the water into that green because of the lip in the bunker.  I hit probably the best shot all day in there.  But then a horrible first putt and a nice little save there.   
 Q.  You have been playing a lot of golf, so are you feeling the benefit of that break at home?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Oh, yeah, it was nice, obviously eight weeks on the road.  So it was nice to go home last week and do some of the stuff that I had kind of piling up at home, and being with my girlfriend and helping her out a little bit, so that was really nice.   
 Q.  Boring domestic stuff or anything exciting at home?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Nothing.  I didn't do anything.  We moved into a new apartment about two months ago, so did some of final stuff there.  Put up some shelves and stuff but nothing major.   
 Q.  And you're paying for it nicely, after Hong Kong.  If you carry on like this, as well, there's still a lot to play for.  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Oh, definitely.  Right now I'm trying to secure my way into next week.  I'd really like to play there.  Hoping this would be a nice little three-week stretch with Dubai and then Leopard Creek after that.
