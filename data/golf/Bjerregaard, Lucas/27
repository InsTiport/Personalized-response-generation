 Q.  What are your thoughts on the way it panned out?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: It was fun to battle with Justin these last two days.  It's guys like him that I want to go out and compete against, and at least I gave him a little bit of a scare.  Early on today, that double-bogey on 14 really cost me.  Got a lucky break there on 13 and made birdie, which was nice.   
And then just, yeah, that double-bogey on 14 really ruined it for me.  But all in all, happy the way I've played.  Happy how I played this weekend, especially.  The last time I was out in the final group on a Sunday, I shot 89.  So 20 shots better today, I'll take that.   
 Q.  Presumably you were aware of the scores all the time and when you reached two ahead at one stage.  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, I was aware of, I think we were both in our little bubble going head-to-head.  I didn't really look much at the leaderboards, but I knew exactly where he was, and yeah, missed a short putt there on 8 and we got to, I think we were 16, both of us.   
And I hit a great shot into 9, probably the best shot I've hit all week.  Made a great birdie there.  And then unfortunately had a little 3-putt there.  But got two ahead, and yeah, of course I'm not thrilled with the way I played on the back nine.  Had a couple of loose shots, but all in all, happy with the way I've handled myself this week.   
 Q.  The bigger picture is good, isn't it:  Turkey and Dubai?  
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Definitely.  I've finished Top-10 now for the last six weeks, so the game is there.  I can feel this is my seventh week, so a little bit of rest the next couple days and hopefully continue in Turkey.
