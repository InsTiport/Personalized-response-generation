LUCAS BJERREGAARD: It feels amazing.  It's been a really good year.  Just got a whole lot better now.  It was tough out there today.  The conditions weren't easy.
Hit a 2-putt there on the last and thought it was going to be really fast, but I've seen a few putts on TV this week that looked super fast.  Obviously misjudged it.  It was a shame to finish like that.  I'm just really happy.
Q. You started the day four back.  What did you say to yourself?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: You know, I've been playing well and conditions weren't easy.  I knew the back nine was going to play tough today.  Made a few birdies.  Missed a couple of good chances on 14 and 15, which I thought were crucial.  Made a really nice putt on 16.
I thought if I could birdie 14, then I'm right in there -- didn't do that.  Then hit a great second shot into 15 and thought, well, at least make this one, and missed it.
I then got up to the green on 16 -- it wasn't really till the last few holes I thought I had a chance.
