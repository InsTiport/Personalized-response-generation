Q. Can you sum up this week.  Justin Thomas, Henrik Stenson, Tiger Woods, great victories.  So confidence going out?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, there's a lot of confidence.  Today sucks.  I'll be honest with you.  I had a lot of confidence from yesterday and the group play.  But today really sucks, so it's just -- I didn't bring my game today, unfortunately.  And, yeah, just kept making mistakes all day.
Fran made it hard.  I didn't put pressure on him, but he put a lot of pressure on me right from the start.  Yeah, it was not really my match.
Q. Coming into the week if someone said you'd make it to the final day, though, would you think, okay, that's not a bad week?
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: No.  It's been a brilliant week.  It's been, of course, I can't stand here and say it's been a bad week.  We were 64 to start and I'm in the last four.  But to lose twice in a day, that hurts.
I had a good match against Kooch this morning, and gave him a little bit for his money down the last few holes, and unfortunately I wasn't able to do that against Frankie today.
Q. Small consolation, 4th place here, 140 FedEx points, to get closer to a little bit closer to special temporary (inaudible).
LUCAS BJERREGAARD: Yeah, it's obviously a goal of mine.  I would love to play over here a bit more.  I've really enjoyed these last few weeks.  So, yeah, it would be nice to have the option to play over here a bit more at least.  Hopefully I can play well the next few weeks and get that done.
