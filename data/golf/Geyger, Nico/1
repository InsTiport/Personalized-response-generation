Q. A 67 to share the lead, how pleased are you with that?
NICO GEYGER: Very pleased.  I played very well today.  Hit a bunch of greens and I made a few putts, so very pleased with it.
Q. The key was the back nine.  What was extra special about that?
NICO GEYGER: Well, I started rolling the putter a little bit better and the putts started dropping, you know, so hit the ball a little bit better and made a few putts.
Q. 4-under leads, so does that give it a sense of how difficult it was out there this morning?
NICO GEYGER: Yeah, it surprised me.  The guys are so good, I thought it was going to be a little bit lower than that.  But the course is very narrow, so you have to be very precise with the tee shots.  If not, it gets you in trouble very easy.  It's a little windy, too, so that's not helping very much.
Q. What did you take from the finish in the Turkish Airlines Challenge?  Give you a bit of confidence coming in?
NICO GEYGER: Yeah, for sure.  As I said before, I've been playing very well.  The results not always go your way, but I feel like I'm hitting the ball quite nice, and once I get the putter rolling, I can do things like today.  So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
Q. Is it all good consolidation now, getting into that Top-64, do you feel?
NICO GEYGER: Yeah, for sure.  Got to get there.  Got to feel the swing going the right way, and that's the idea.
