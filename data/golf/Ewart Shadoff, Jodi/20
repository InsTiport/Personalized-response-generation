 Q.  So you guys got a crucial two points for your team today.  How did it feel just finishing off the match?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It's always good to get a point on the board for the team.  I think we had a pretty good day.  Australia has a great team and to get a point and a half is obviously a great start.   
 Q.  Were you guys able to feed off each other like ham and egg all day, you just --  
BRONTE LAW: I think so.  Yeah.  Jodi had some really good putts that were really important around the middle of the round and I had some good putts towards the end and I think we just kind of worked fairly well together as a team.  She would have good holes, I would have good holes and that's always key for better ball.  I think we were just pretty consistent all day, we didn't really like have any mistakes as such.  So, yeah, it's good.   
 Q.  Any crucial moments in the match that stick out in your mind when you were starting to build your lead?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I think maybe around the middle of the round, like 9 and 10, that just gave us a little bit of a cushion, I think.  We were 2-up going down 14 ran we just kind of said to each other, let's win the next two and be done on 15, so we did.
