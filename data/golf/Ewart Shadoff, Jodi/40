 Q.  How huge are those first two points for you guys?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Huge.  I mean, to play against a team like Lexi and Cristie, we were definitely the underdogs.  We played really well together.   
HOLLY CLYBURN: We came out fighting and we just did what we needed to do and we fed off each other brilliantly all day.   
 Q.  How did you feed off of each other?  
HOLLY CLYBURN: Well, just keeping each other company and stuff like that, and also just how well Jodi was striking it and putting.  One of her two putts were going to drop, and it did when we needed to on 13.   
It just felt like I wouldn't have a good hole but then there was Holly backing me up and vice versa, so we had each other's backs all day.   
 Q.  Are you going to be paired together tomorrow, too?  
HOLLY CLYBURN: I think considering how well the guys behind are playing, I can't see us changing pairings now.   
 Q.  Talk about the emotions on the first tee.  Did you guys feel a lot of pressure?  Obviously Team USA was pretty popular here.  How did you get past I guess the emotion and really settle in?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I mean, obviously we were both very proud to represent our country, and I was feeling nervous on the first tee.  I even told Holly I was a bit nervous there on the first tee.  But I was just like any other tournament, like the nerves go away after a couple holes, and we just steadied into it.
