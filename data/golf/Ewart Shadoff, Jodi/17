 Q.  Your thoughts on your first round here in Chinese Taipei?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, a good round.  Everything seems to be clicking today.  I hit some really close shots and holed some good putts.  Overall a good day.   
 Q.  You went out on the back nine in 32, which has been the hardest nine so far.  There are difficult holes on the back nine.  Do you think your length is really helping you?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Definitely, courses that are long suits my game.  The greens are small, but yeah, I got off to a really good start.   
You have to be very strategic.  You can't just hit driver everywhere.  I hit 12 fairways today, so that definitely helped.   
 Q.  This is your fourth event in Asia.  How do you keep going and stay motivated?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, it's starting to get tougher.  Ready for a break, definitely.  But just trying to get through this week and my rounds.   
 Q.  65 must inspire confidence.  It's a great golf course and good setup here.  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, it's definitely nice to walk to my room now.  Definitely helps.   
 Q.  Pretty good past couple weeks.  With the hole-in-one last week, you played really well and playing well again here, do you think you're playing the best golf of the year for you?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, definitely.  I think changing my irons a month ago has definitely helped with my confidence.   
I've just been lacking feel in my long game the whole year, really, and it's just affected my confidence somewhat.  So it's nice just to like be able to trust what I'm doing and my swing.
