Q. Another great round, you mentioned yesterday your confidence was at an all-time high.  This has to help again?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, to follow up a good round yesterday with a solid round today in the afternoon conditions, it's a good confidence boost for sure, yeah.
Q. You mentioned the changes you made to your putter.  The ball was rolling good again today?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, it was.  The greens, the poa annua starts to grow through in the afternoon, so they are a little bit bumpy.  But overall, again I putted well and my distance control was really good, so that helps.
Q. The finish on 18, great round overall.  Does that in any way negatively affect the really good outcome you had?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It's disappointing to finish with a bogey but it is the toughest hole on the golf course.  I can't be too disappointed.  I had a lot of good stuff happen out there today, so I can't really take away from that.
Q. On a positive note, making the cut, your position here almost guarantees you a spot in ANA.  Again, that has to help with your confidence; that was one of your goals coming into this year, wasn't it?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, for sure.  Obviously last year wasn't the greatest years, and to get into the majors was a goal of mine.  The ANA is one of my favorite events, so kind of happy to be going back for sure.
Q. If things go as planned right now, you could be paired with your good friend, Jessica Korda tomorrow.  How much fun would you two have out there?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, that would be a blast actually.  It would be a lot of fun for sure.
