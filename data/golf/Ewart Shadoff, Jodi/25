Q. 8-under par heading into the weekend.  How does that feel?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It's good.  I didn't have a great week last week.  A little bit tired coming off Solheim.
But I had some rest at the start of the week and feel fresh again.  Hit some great putts today, so that's good for my confidence going into the weekend.
Q. How is the course playing compared to yesterday?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Well, you know in the morning the greens are a lot softer, more receptive, which is nice.  You can be more aggressive.
So, yeah, in that respect it was nice.
Q. Have you fully recovered from Solheim?  What was that experience like?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I think I'm due a week off for sure.  It's a long, tiring week full of emotions.  It's definitely draining.
Yeah, looking forward to a week off.  First things first:  weekend here.
