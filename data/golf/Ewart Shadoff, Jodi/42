Q. You said you had to keep doing the things that you were doing and things would work out.  Do you think they worked out?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, I played really solid today.  The wind was brutal again, and the greens were pretty fast.  So I just struck the ball really well all week, and I played really well, and that was the difference to me this week.
Q. Overall result, what do you think?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I'm very happy.  I've been playing solid all year, and this is probably going to be my first top-10 of the season.  To do it in the U.S. Women's Open, I can't complain much about that.
Q. How do you boost this going into -- you have the Crown coming up?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yep.
Q. How do you use this?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It's a huge confidence boost.  Like I said, I've been playing pretty solid all year and finally getting the putter working.  I love match play, too, and I love being in a team environment, so I'm really looking forward to it.
Q. How was your experience at CordeValle?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Awesome.  I played here once last year, I love the golf course.  I think it's a great test with the wind.  The greens were firm and they were a great pace.  I just love playing here.
