Q. Bogey-free today; how was your day, and how did you feel out there?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It was good.  I was feeling calm, relaxed, just enjoyed the round, hitting the ball well, and some putts fell in the middle of the round, so it was nice.
Q. Any highlights, any particularly long putts, anything that stood out?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I hit a nice shot into the first hole.  The first hole I think is probably one of the most intimidating holes, and I hit it to a couple of feet, so that was a good start.  No. 10, I holed a pretty long putt from the front of the green.  It must have been 40, 45 feet, so that was nice.  But yeah, just solid play really.  I think I missed out on a couple putts coming in, so I left a little bit out there, too.
Q. How were the fans out there today?  Seemed to be pretty loud in certain spots.
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, they were awesome.  They were really good.  With this being the first year, you never know what to expect, but the whole day they've been great, cheering, and I'm out there playing with a couple of Solheim Cup prospects, but they're still cheering for me, so that's really nice, too.
