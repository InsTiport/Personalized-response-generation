 Q.   Tough to come back, but good to finish with a birdie, I'm sure. (No microphone)?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah, it was tough to wake up at 4:30 this morning and to get back into it.   Parred the first hole, so it was nice to have two putts and a birdie to finish the round.  
   
 Q.   Your position on the leaderboard is number 3.   
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah, it's a good position going into the weekend.   I still have to do what I've been doing the past two rounds, and I'm happy with where my game is, so I'm going to keep that going.  
   
 Q.   Would you say there is one aspect that's better suited to Sebonack?   Maybe putting, getting up‑and‑down?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   No, I think the past two rounds have been hitting greens.   I really think you need to hit greens out here.   That is the main thing.   Stay patient and take the chances when you get them so.  
   
 Q.   The tough part is waiting.   What are you going to do with your waiting time?   
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   I think I'm going to go back to the house and chill and maybe take a little nap and then come back out and warm up as if it was, obviously, the first round of the weekend.
