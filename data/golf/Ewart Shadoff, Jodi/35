JODI EWART SHADOFF: You know, fortunate to be a part of -- being with Omni United and Radar Tires as my sponsor, they have a huge connection with the Breast Cancer Research Association and they have donated over or $1 million in the past five years to help the cause.
This year they asked me to be a part of it and I have an awesome bag.  I'm wearing pink every day to just raise awareness basically.  I've been really fortunate not to have any personal experience with the disease.
It's not about donations.  It's about raising awareness.  If anybody can see me out there, husband, boyfriend, a woman herself, and ask, What is this girl doing?  I've never had a mammogram.  Should I have one?
If that helps save one life, we've succeeded in our mission.
Q. So you're scheduled to play in three tournaments this month?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, all three tournaments in October.  So this week, next week, and in Malaysia.  So that will be three events hoping to raise awareness.  It's an honor.
As I said I'm really lucky to have such amazing sponsors that will help me do this.
