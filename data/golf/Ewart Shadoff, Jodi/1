Q. Can you just tell us a little bit about the course conditions today versus the first round you played at Cypress Creek?
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   They're very wet today.  Pretty much on every hole we were getting mud balls off the tee so it was difficult.  Hitting into the greens trying to decide which way the balls are going to go with the mud and stuff, so, yeah, it was playing a lot different to the first day.
Q. It's been a strange year for everyone, but what are the positives you can take out of your game for the year going into 2021?
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   I played really consistent this year through everything.  I worked really hard on my short game during lock down and I've started to see some good progress on that and, yeah, I'm just happy to be out here playing, to be honest.
Q. Lastly, you played with an amateur today with I think rid, there's a couple amateurs on the first page of the leaderboard, do you think an amateur could win the championship this year?
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   I mean anything's possible.  I think rid played great today, I played with Kaitlyn at the ANA this year and she's a really solid player, so, yeah, I don't see why not.
