JODI EWART SHADOFF: I got on a train of birdies early on in the round.  The course is playing really nice; greens are rolling good.  I was hitting the ball close and I hit 18 greens today.  I guess that helped.   
 Q.  This is a course that, yeah, if you're anywhere out there you're going to have a lot of opportunities to stick it, aren't you?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Oh, yeah, for sure.  I mean, I only missed one fairway today.  The par-5s are gettable; most of them are reachable, so that helps.   
Like I said, if you can get the putter hot you can go really low around here.   
 Q.  Something between the concentration and the heat, how to keep your focus?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: You know, we played last week in above 100 all week, so that was good practice for this week.   
Today actually felt kind of cool compared to that.
