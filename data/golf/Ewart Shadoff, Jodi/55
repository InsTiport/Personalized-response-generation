 Q.   Talk about the course today, how you felt especially compared to yesterday?   
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah, the wind was in a little bit of a different direction from yesterday, and obviously a little more stronger, so it was playing a lot tougher.   
They moved the tees back a little bit too, so overall the course was playing a lot harder.   But I just told myself par is good on every hole, so stay patient, and that's what I was playing for really.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel about how you did today?   
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   I did good.   Midâ€‘round right now, but, yeah, it's going well, and I'm staying patient.   I've had a lot of good shots today, so it's good coming into the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Are you excited, nervous, upset to come back tomorrow and have to play your last couple of holes?   
JODI EWART SHADOFF:   It is what it is.   It's not the first, and it won't be the last time that happens.   So you just have to roll with it and be patient and play your own games.
