(In progress.)   
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Like the club that I finished, like on the 7-iron, and they came up short of the ridge.  Decided go with an easy 6 and landed on top of the slope and just kind of rolled down into the role.   
 Q.  How many hole in ones...  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: This is my 9th hole in one.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: No, no, unfortunately, and no prizes.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I have no idea actually.  I just had one in the practice round in Korea last week, too.   
 Q.  Really?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah.  So it's my second hole in one in 11 days.   
 Q.  Is it just by chance?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: No, not really.  Definitely striking the ball better than what I have done pretty much all year.   
So, yeah, had a couple looks today on other shots too.  It was good.   
 Q.  Any particular reason you think you're striking it better?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I actually switched irons before coming to Asia.  New shafts, different heads, a little bit of a heavier shaft, a little bit stiffer.   
Just I think my old irons were just a little bit too weak for me.  I was struggling to control them.   
 Q.  What do you switch from specifically?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I came from a TaylorMade PSI iron with a Kuro Kage shaft, and I'm now in a Titleist AP2 with a Lunist shaft.  Couple degrees heavier, couple grams heavier.   
 Q.  First time playing with Titleist irons?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: No, I actually pretty much played Titleist my whole career until maybe just after I graduated college.   
I played the same irons, TaylorMade irons, for the past three years.  Just kind of like going out of my comfort zone, but decided it needed to be done.   
 Q.  And I was talking to your husband.  What's it like having him over here?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It's cool.  Yeah, I've been out here for almost three weeks now.  It's nice to have some company.  Shanghai is such a cool city, so we've been exploring a little bit so it's been nice.   
 Q.  He says he tries to come over like once a year.  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Usually when I'm over here in Asia he'll come in the middle of it, kind of break it up.   
 Q.  And you also had a huge eagle putt, right?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, on 17.  I think my caddie said it was 65, 70 feet.  Yeah, two eagles in one round.   
 Q.  First time two eagles?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: No.  Actually.  Maybe my second time.
