Q. 5-under today; 5-under for the tournament.  What's the key to the round?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I hit fairways today, which was a lot of improvement over yesterday.  Just I was hitting it close.  Had two tap-in birdies early and a couple putts just rolled in.  The greens are a lot nicer this morning.
So, yeah.
Q. How much confidence does that give you when you get the tap-ins early in the round?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, it's nice.  I hit the ball really well today.  Didn't have a single bogey.  It's good confidence leading into the weekend for sure.
Q. You're finding yourself in this position more and more often.  How are your nerves going into a weekend near the top of the leaderboard now?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: You know, as you said, I'm finding myself more in this position, so the more times I've put myself in the position the easier it gets for sure.
I'm just going to continue doing what I'm doing and take every shot as it comes and see what happens.
Q. 2017, big year obviously with Solheim Cup coming.  How important is that to you and is that one of your main goals?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It's definitely probably my No. 1 goal aside from a personal win.  It would mean everything to be on the team again.  2013 was probably the greatest golf experience I've ever had.  Yeah, definitely looking to be on the team again this year.
