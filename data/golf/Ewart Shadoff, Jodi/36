 Q.  Down three early on.  Did you get a chance to regroup when the weather hit?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, absolutely.  I have a lot to thank my team for.  The hour or so that we were in the rain delay, it was nice just to have that team atmosphere back, and definitely I saw where everybody was, definitely spurred me on.  I think that was definitely a turning point, and I holed my putt when I came back out on No. 13.  That was a little bit of a good kick-start.   
 Q.  What did they share with you, just try to pump you up?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, we all tried to pump each other up.  We were all down, so just tried to get each other going.   
 Q.  Did you know you needed to win this match to give yourselves a chance?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, absolutely.  Everybody needed to win their match.  But it was really important for me to get back.
