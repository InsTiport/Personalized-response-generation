Q. This would be I think first time this season you've had three consecutive rounds in the 60s.
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah.  I mean, it's really scorable out there.  It's fun to play this course.  Greens are rolling nice; there is ton of birdies out there, so it's a lot of fun.
Q. What else has been the key for you personally?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I've just been hitting the ball really well.  I've been struggling in recent weeks with my iron play; this week I've been striking it really well.  I found something the a range earlier in the week.
I even left a couple out there today, but hopefully get them tomorrow.
Q. Find anything specific or more just like a feeling?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: No, just really trying to get the feel.  You know, I think I was just becoming too overcomplicated, too many swing thoughts, and really need to simplify it and try and get some feel involved.
Q. What are your thoughts heading into tomorrow?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Just do the same thing:  keep same thoughts and hopefully putts will roll in.
