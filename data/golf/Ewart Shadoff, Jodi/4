  Q. Finishing under par on a day like this, how are you feeling coming off round one?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah, good.  This course is so tough.  It's set up really long and obviously with the wind it makes it extra tricky.
 So to be under par around here today is a good spot.  I'll take it.
 Q. You've got a friend Holly back on the bag.  What's that like for you?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   It's good.  You know, we have a lot of fun out there.  She's very positive and she's a great green reader.  It really helps me.
 So, yeah, it's a lot of fun.
 Q. I remember you saying that back when she was on the bag in Toledo, too.  I mean, that must have helped with the fast and hot start.  Take us through those three birdies on the front nine.
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah, I birdied the 1st hole, so that's nice to get off to a good start.  Birdied 9, which is a tricky par-3 downwind.
 You know, I don't remember the third one.  Yeah, I mean, birdies are -- it's hard to make birdies out here just with the setup and the wind and everything, so just took chances when I could.
 Q. This wind can be brutal, especially with these greens.  What's been your strategy going forward?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah, I think just being aggressive when I can afford to be aggressive and just hitting it to the middle of the greens when maybe the pins are tucked or whatever.
 Just to play smart and be aggressive when I can afford to be.
 Q. How is your back feeling?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   It's better, yeah.
 Q. What happened?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   I sprained my SI joint, the ligament in my SI joint.
 Q. Hitting a golf shot?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   I was unplugging the charger from the wall.  Yeah, not even a fun story.
 Q. Terrible.
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   So, yeah.  But it's getting better.  I took three weeks off or so and just kind of eased into practice.  This is the first time I've walked 18 holes since KPMG.
 Q. And how did you rehab?  What do you do?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   A lot of -- getting a lot of physio and doing some rehab exercises.  Just slowly trying to get back into working out and doing some strengthening stuff.
 Just started with short game and then kind of gradually hit one more club every day and just worked myself up.  I didn't try to rush back or anything.  I've probably been practicing for the last two or so weeks.
 Q. Is this a different area in your back than before?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yes, different injury.  Unfortunately.  But these things happen.  I have a good team around me, good doctors, and good physios, so...
 Q. You've also got a special follower I feel like this week.  Talk to me about that.
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah, he has a couple days off.  He has to go back to work tomorrow, but will be off Saturday.  He's happy to get out of the house.  He's been working from home since February, so he's like I just got to come and get out of the house.  It's like a vacation for him.
 Q. Do you have a studio in the house?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   He has as office works in, but he sets up his camera in part of the house that he reports from.  Yeah.
 Q. Fun.  I was going to say, when is the last time he was able to come out?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   I think Boca I think was the last time.  Yeah.
 Q. So Holly first time back on your bag since Toledo.
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah.  She's finishing the year out with me.  So, yeah.
 Q. How many more are you playing?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Three, two in Texas and Naples.
 Q. The whole stretch?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yes.
