  Q. Nothing like a good way to close out two weeks here in Toledo.  How are you feeling coming off the course?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Good.  I played pretty solid today.  The course was set up pretty difficult, some tough pins, and it firmed up throughout the week.
 Pretty happy with how I'm hitting it.  Rolled some nice putts out there today, so good I'm in shape going to Scotland I think.
 Q. I was going to say, one of the things you said coming off was the putts just weren't dropping.  How did you feel about your putting today.
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Much better.  I feel a lot more confident than I did yesterday.  In hindsight obviously I wish I would've putted like I did today yesterday.  These things happened and all you can do is learn, so hopefully I can take the game I have today and go to Scotland with it.
 Q. How exciting is it to turn around and just focus again on Scotland and then a major just around the corner?
 JODI EWART SHADOFF:   Yeah, obviously the British Open is always one that -- well, for me personally -- I want to get.  Definitely using the Scottish Open as preparation for Royal Troon.  Yeah, going to be nice to kind of go home.  I know we can't go anywhere, but be nice to be back home for a while.
