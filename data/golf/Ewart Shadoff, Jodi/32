 Q.  6-under today.  What was working well for you?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I was hitting the ball really good front nine; holing some good putts.  Last week I was just really struggling with my swing, and I think today -- yesterday just kind of clicked, so it was nice.   
The first four, five holes I just gained lot of confidence in my ball striking.  I think that was the difference.   
 Q.  Was there anything you were working on in your swing?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I just lost a little bit of timing so my tempo was a little bit off.  Just the strike was not good.   
But this week everything seemed to click.  Obviously when I that happens you can build confidence on that.   
I putted well, too, so it was a good all-round day I think.   
 Q.  Yeah, good conditions looked like.  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It was absolutely perfect today.  I mean, you know, like couple-mile-an-hour wind.  Perfect.   
 Q.  How is the course playing?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: It's really nice.  It's in great shape.  Greens are rolling great.  They're not too fast, not too slow.   
They're rolling really well.  As you can see from the leaderboard, it's playing well.   
 Q.  Anything you're working on today to get ready for tomorrow?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I think I'll just go hit couple balls and just 15 minutes on the putting green that that'll be about it.
