Q. Take us through 7-under and how good that felt.
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, yesterday -- I've only missed one fairway the past two days, so I'm hitting the ball really well. I only had a couple bad iron shots yesterday, and a lot of my putts just didn't go in. But today I was rolling a lot of nice putts in, so it was nice to see.
Q. Is this a really good momentum shift for the weekend?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, definitely. You know, as I said, I'm really happy with how I'm hitting the ball, and if I can continue to hole putts, I think I'll be in good position.
Q. Are you pain-free in your back now?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yes, completely pain-free.
Q. Left ankle?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I had a weird toe issue yesterday, which kind of fluke, but I woke up today feeling better, so yeah. Yeah, I think it's age. I have all these weird niggling injuries come and go within a day, so yeah, it's weird.
Q. If you could repeat tomorrow what you did today, you'd be a happy camper?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Oh, I'd be very happy, yes. Very, very happy.
Q. And you came in, what, at 52, I think, in the CME Globe? And with the change and everything, how nice is it for someone in your position when anybody can win it?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, obviously $1.5 million is a nice prize. I think everyone -- to play really well for this week, it's one of the most important tournaments of the year, given the first-prize money. Yeah, just try to finish strong.
Q. What was your eagle, the details of your eagle?
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I had like two -- I think it was around 209 pin, and I hit 3-wood to 12 feet and holed the putt. Yeah, I landed it perfectly. I hit the shot and it landed, and I was like, I couldn't have landed that in a better spot. Yeah, it's nice when those shots -- you pull those shots off.
