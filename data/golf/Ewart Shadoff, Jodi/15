 Q.  What a good round.  Nice to see yourself up there.  What's going well?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I'm just hitting the ball really well this week, and holing some nice putts.  I think the course is set up well, and it's playing tough.  The wind was a little bit of a factor today and there were some tough pin positions.  So I'm happy with how I played.   
 Q.  You've actually started the season off well this year.  Is there anything you did over the winter break that was different?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, I worked a little bit on my downswing and I switched back to steel-shafted irons, so it's really helped, especially in the wind, helped.   
 Q.  What kind of irons do you use?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: PING.  So then just worked really hard on my short game and you know, I haven't putted as well as I've wanted to the last few weeks, but this week seems to be trending in the right direction.   
 Q.  And the sort of changes to the course, the greens are playing quite fast; do you like fast greens?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I do, actually.  I like fast greens.  I think the greens are a really good pace and are in great shape.   
So yeah, it's nice to see it.  I like the changes that they have made over the past year.   
 Q.  Is this why you are fourth tournament in a row?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Fourth tournament.   
 Q.  How are your energy levels?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: I think I'm just happy and confident in my game, so I think my confidence has taken over how tired I feel at this point.   
 Q.  Your confidence gives you energy?  
JODI EWART SHADOFF: Yeah, definitely.
