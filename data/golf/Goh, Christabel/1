 Q.   Round one, HSBC Women's Champions, how did it go?  
CHRISTABEL GOH:   Honestly, hoped it went better, but I hit quite a few good shots.   Put it in the hole on No.18.  
   
 Q.   What did you hole out in?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   A birdie on 18.   
   
 Q.   So you chipped in?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   No, I was three, right by the end in Sentosa.   
   
 Q.   So what did you go around in?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   80.   
   
 Q.   And front nine, back nine?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   I started 39 on the actual front, so 39/41 or 41/39, whichever way you want to go.  
   
 Q.   And you're familiar with the course, how did you find it, was it as expected or did it throw up any surprises?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   No surprises.   I was the only one who was doing the surprising.   Just, you know, I've been fighting a bug, and haven't really been practising for the past week or so.   
   
 Q.   And how was the occasion?   Were you a little bit nervous?   Were you relaxed out there or did you find quite high expectations of yourself?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   Beyond belief last night, I was on the verge of freaking out and this morning I get here, and okay, I settled my routine really, really quickly and after warming up, it all went away.   
As I was walking down my first hole, I was like, oh, hey, I'm not that nervous.   I mean, I am, but I'm not freaking out.   
   
 Q.   Do you get much support going around?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   Yeah, I had a couple of friends coming out, she came by, and another good friend of mine flew down from Thailand a couple of days early.  
   
 Q.   Who caddied for you?  
CHRISTABEL GOH:   Aaron Landry, I believe he caddies out here sometimes.   
   
 Q.   And just quickly, your thoughts ahead of tomorrow, how will you approach tomorrow, same as today?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   I will try not to be so hard on myself in the sense that I'll try to let myself play easier shots and not scramble so much.   
   
 Q.   Were you placing it well on the fairway?   Was there one particular aspect of the game that you want to focus on tomorrow?   
CHRISTABEL GOH:   I haven't really thought about it yet.   Just going to rest up, the heat is really getting to me, especially my front nine, I had trouble getting into the groove, getting some momentum going.   Trouble breathing, as well, but now it's all good.
