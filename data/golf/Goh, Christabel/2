  Q. What do you think of your round today?  
 CHRISTABEL GOH: Today was just really, really tough. I had such a bad day. Really didn't make any putts until the last hole.   
 Yeah, I hit lots of good shots. I had really good birdie chances in my first three holes. I missed both and they were short putts and that was just really frustrating. And yeah, a double-bogey at 14 again. That was a bad day chipping, not a very good day putting. So hopefully tomorrow will be better.  
  
  Q. Are you getting more used to playing in front of crowds now?  
 CHRISTABEL GOH: I don't really have a big crowd following me (laughing).  
  
  Q. Just putting things in perspective, what is the entire learning lesson that you will take away from this?  
 CHRISTABEL GOH: Yeah, just pretty much need more practise on my short game around the greens, and yeah, I need to learn how to play a few more shots and get really good at them.   
 And now I'm kind of really good at one only, and probably not the best shot to play in certain situations. So just need to have a few more different shots in my bag and I think it will be good for next year.   
 I've already improved since last year. Being in America has made me a much better player, so hopefully same progress this year, and then we'll see how next year goes.
