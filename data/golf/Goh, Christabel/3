  Q. What was your round like?   
 CHRISTABEL GOH: It was better than yesterday. A bit up-and-down. Made some really good putts. Just messed up a couple of holes, had I think three double-bogeys. That kind killed my score. Other than that, I played really well.  
  
  Q. How has the experience been so far?  
 CHRISTABEL GOH: Just trying not to freak out still. It's just crazy. I'm not used to having so many people come out and just playing in Singapore as a Singaporean is like a really, really big deal.   
  
  Q. Is it harder for you to tee off on the 10th?   
 CHRISTABEL GOH: No, I think I prefer teeing off on 10 maybe. I haven't quite decided yet.  
  
  Q. Tell us about your birdies. You had a couple of nice birdies there.   
 CHRISTABEL GOH: Yeah, I think I had three maybe. Something like that. Well, yeah, good birdies. Birdies are always good. Plus I need birdie on that stupid hole I double-bogeyed yesterday. That was nice. It almost went in for eagle. It should have gone payback time.   
  
  Q. Are you expecting better play going into the weekend?   
 CHRISTABEL GOH: Yeah, I expect to gradually get better every day. Maybe if they play for one whole week, I might win. Just kidding.  
  
  Q. Do you think you will have the best score over the four years we've had this tournament --  
 CHRISTABEL GOH: What's the best score?   
  
  Q. I think it's plus 28.   
 CHRISTABEL GOH: Are you sure?   
  
  Q. Maybe it's plus 33, I don't know. I have to double-check my numbers. Pretty high.   
 CHRISTABEL GOH: Is that even a question? That shouldn't be considered. (Laughter) I'm 16 over now, if I remember correctly -- no, 17, 16, something like that.   
  
  Q. Were you expecting it to be that bad?  
 CHRISTABEL GOH: Really it's just my putting that let me down. I hit it really, really well yesterday and not hitting quite so good today but I made lot of good putts, so that's a plus point.   
 Yeah, just I expect to play better over the weekend, even though there are more people. Still trying not to freak out. I think it might take a while to get used to it.
