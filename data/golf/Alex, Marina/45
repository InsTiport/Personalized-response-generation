 Q.  Congratulations.  Can you tell us what was working out there for you?  MARINA ALEX: I was patient for probably nine holes.  I didn't have perfect numbers, but I was able to hit shots, in between numbers, with just hitting soft irons into the greens and kind of utilizing that to get them to stop, and made a couple of good putts there in the middle. I made a really, really nice -- I bogeyed 18, that's a hard hole.  I wasn't that frustrated with it.  I made the turn, missed a short putt on 1 for birdie.  And then I got through I think it was No. 4, I made a really, really nice putt.  It had to be 30 feet, breaker, to get me back to 2-under, and it kind of just propelled me through the round.  I was hitting it really well, just tee to green was really solid.   Q.  Did you think you had this coming in?  MARINA ALEX: I hit pretty good in Arkansas.  I was hitting a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.  And I was trying to feed off of that for this week.  And so far so good.   Q.  Tell me a little bit about the course, how did it play out there?  MARINA ALEX: USGA set it up really well today.  This morning it was wet, because we had a little rain.  And I felt how they set up the holes as far as length and hole locations was really, really good.   Q.  To shoot 68 on a course like this, what's that like?  MARINA ALEX: It's just kind of -- it's hard to go into The Open with any expectations, so I was just going out there and seeing -- putting my best game together and this is what I got today and I'm very pleased with it.   Q.  Do you think this could be a number that holds up as the afternoon wave goes through?  MARINA ALEX: I have no idea.  It's really hard to tell.  If the greens still stay receptive, who knows.  The fairways may dry out a little bit, maybe the afternoon players may have shorter irons, can happen, but I think that number is definitely out there for the afternoon.   Q.  Two weeks ago you had a top 10?  MARINA ALEX: Yeah, a lot of things have fallen together.  I've been working on my swing, and I have my caddie, who is absolutely awesome, I love her, she helped me out so much.  It's little things here and there piecing it together, and it's kind of showing right now, which is great.   Q.  Since you started with Ian, what have been your goals?  MARINA ALEX: I started working with Ian, I took an odd lesson here and there at the end of last year.  And I was still kind of working with Joe a little bit, too. And then come Australia, I kind of made the change to work with Ian.  We've been working on some fundamental stuff, a little bit of swing plane and club face, just trying to get into a more consistent place.  And it's showing now.   Q.  Can you talk about the atmosphere?  MARINA ALEX: It's awesome.  There are so many people out here, it's great.  The crowds are loving it, and they're everywhere.  It's not just a particular group or any particular hole.  They're scouted out throughout the golf course, and it's wonderful.  It really does feel like a major.   Q.  You are not from far from here?  MARINA ALEX: A few hours, northern New Jersey.  I think it's about two and a half hours from here.  I have some family and friends from the club I grew up at.  They're down for support, so it's good.
