 Q.  How is it to get the first round of 2019 out of the way?  
MARINA ALEX: It was cool.  It's definitely a different first round experience than I will probably ever have.  But first nine holes was a little shaky and rusty.  I mean, it's just you never know what it's going to be like the first day back on the job.   
But I had the best playing company I could have had, so we had a great time.   
 Q.  What was it like playing with celebrities?  
MARINA ALEX: Both of these guys were so nice, down to earth, wonderful.  Roger was really focused on his game.  Toby was too.  He hit two of the best flop shots I think I've ever seen in my life.  I'm not exaggerating.  They were like professional level flop shots.  In some place, like he was behind 16 green over the back and hit a flop shot to 7 feet, made the putt for par.  If anyone's seen that hole on TV, it's just that was nuts.  And then he hit a great one on 17 to try and get up and down for par.  He didn't make the putt.  Either way, they were a blast to play with.   
 Q.  Did you ask any questions of them?  
MARINA ALEX: No, not really.  Roger and I were talking a little bit about just getting back in the season and like just kicking the rust off and all that stuff.  There's a lot of overlap in any sport, between baseball or football or whatever.  And Toby was just singing us some songs.   
 Q.  What did he sing?  
MARINA ALEX: He was just kind of making things up as he went along.   
 Q.  Poopy golfer?  
MARINA ALEX: And he was singing his poopy golfer song.  I don't want to be incorrect.  He has a different actual title.  No, they had great energy.  It was a ton of fun.   
 Q.  What was it like to lead off the season hitting on the 1st tee?  
MARINA ALEX: I was nervous.  I'm not going to lie.  I wanted to hit a good one in front of those guys.  They're a big deal.
