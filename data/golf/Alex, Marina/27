 Q.  You said at the media day you usually don't play well here.  What has changed?  
MARINA ALEX: I don't know.  I mean, definitely been playing better golf the past year.  Just have more confidence coming into this event.   
I felt like if I just relax and play the way I have been playing, should have a better result that I've had in years past.   
 Q.  And now you're in contention in your home state.  What does that feel like?  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, it's really cool.  Similar experience to last year at the Open.  U.S. Open I played well.  There is definitely some positive stuff to pull from there, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  And the fact that you have a big following is more relaxing than nerve wracking?  
MARINA ALEX: It can go both ways.  It's great to have the support, but it's also a little bit of added pressure.  Just try and go into tomorrow and have a good day and try not to put too much pressure on myself.   
 Q.  What was working well for you today?  
MARINA ALEX: Just keeping it in the right parts of the golf course.  Like hitting a lot of fairways out here like I did yesterday.  If I wasn't on the green, I had --  I only had one kind of really tricky up and down which I didn't get up and down.   
That was kind of the only spot in I think two days that I really put myself in a place where par was going to be pretty challenging.   
So just hitting it in a spot where I'm safe to make a par if I'm not close enough to the hole.   
 Q.  How important was it to have another good round today?  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, just really good confidence building.  Nice to back up yesterday with today's score.  Hopefully the weather cooperates and we'll be able to get out there tomorrow.   
 Q.  They will be later tee times.  
MARINA ALEX: Probably.  Be good to sleep in.
