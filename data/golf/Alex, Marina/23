MARINA ALEX: It was firm today.  The greens were really firm.  The last like six holes, it was tough to just get at the flags.  Once you got past 12 -- it's hard to get it close.  I hit really good putts, too, and it was just a lot of lips.  But hoping to just have a really great day and see what happens.   
I know they've kind of pulled away a little bit, but if I have a really nice day tomorrow, who knows.   
 Q.  Yeah, anything can happen.  
MARINA ALEX: Exactly.   
 Q.  You got off to such an awesome start on Thursday, kept it up yesterday --  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, it's hard.  That was definitely the best round of golf I've ever played, and when you don't feel like you're doing that every day, you feel like you're not playing great, even though you're still doing just fine.  So it's just kind of tough mentally to just realize, yeah, you're still playing good, it's just the first day was special, so I'm hoping I have another special one in the bag tomorrow.   
 Q.  What are you going to do to prepare?  
MARINA ALEX: The same thing that I've been doing, just eating, hanging out.  We're staying on Alberta Street, which is a really nice little spot, so maybe walk around, and there's always people out, get some ice cream.   
 Q.  Have you been able to eat at any hot spots or --  
MARINA ALEX: There's been a couple repeat places.  Like I've been to this Mexican place called  ¿Por quÃ© no? twice.  It's really good.  I've had two different ramen stops.  I've been to Bamboo Sushi twice.  That place was awesome.  And a bunch of different spots for brunch.  I think I've been to a different one every day.  Yeah, where did I go today?  Little Skillet or something like that.  I don't know, it was really good.  Yeah, I've eaten anything you can eat here.   
 Q.  Well, you're still in it, anything can happen tomorrow, and if everything just works out in the end, you would be a first-time Rolex winner --  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, that would be really cool.   
 Q.  How much would a win mean to you at this point?  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, it's huge.  I've been close on occasions.  I think just the more chances I give myself consistently, I truly believe it'll happen.  Whether it's tomorrow or not.  It would be great.  If it's not, it's not.  I'll still have more opportunities along the line this year and next year.  I'm just going to go out and play the best that I can and just try and chase the girls ahead of me, Georgia and Minjee.   
 Q.  Did you get a chance to talk to Stacy at all?  
MARINA ALEX: I haven't, no.  She's probably getting ready to have her baby girl, so I don't really want to bother her with golf things.  She probably wants a break anyway.
