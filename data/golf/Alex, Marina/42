 Q.  6-under today, what was the key to your strong play?  
MARINA ALEX: I putted great.  Obviously anyone who shots a low number is going to say they putted well.  I just worked a little bit on it yesterday and I just for whatever reason, the stuff that I was working on really felt good on the course and I holed a bunch of putts.  Some are 20 to 30-footers, so it was really nice to see some long putts go in the hole.   
 Q.  What were some of the things that you were working on the past couple days to get your game in a good spot?  
MARINA ALEX: Just my setup and basic stuff.  We have been out here quite a few weeks now, and when you play week-after-week, sometimes just basic things get off.   
So I was trying to just go back to setup, posture, all that, just to make sure I'm in order going into today and it made the difference for sure.   
 Q.  Pretty fun group for you, you and Michelle are pretty tight.  Were you feeding off each other out there?  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, I think so.  We were just making a ton of birdies, and it was just -- she's awesome to play with.  It was really lighthearted, and Winnie, the other young amateur in our group is a super sweet girl and she's got a ton of talent.  We just had a great time out there, the three of us.
