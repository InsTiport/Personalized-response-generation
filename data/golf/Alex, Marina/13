 Q.  A round of 65, what was the key to that?  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, I putted great today. I hit it better than yesterday, as well. My coach is here this week, so we were working on a bunch of different things at the beginning of the week. My swing was kind of getting a little -- not in a great place and he we were trying to fix some stuff and yesterday it was just hard to feel comfortable with it. So ball-striking wise wasn't super-solid yesterday. I actually putted pretty well. I made some good par putts to keep my round life and take better ball-striking, good putting, so kind of coming into form a bit.   
 Q.  What did you work on with your thoughts?  
MARINA ALEX: The first few feet of my swing, for some reason, I don't know if it's like a physical thing that I'm doing. I've been working on it with my physical therapist, I'm tight and I'm kind of shutting the clubface down a little bit. So we are really feeling like the clubface is opening early and it's setting in a little bit of a different spot at the top, so my timing needs to change from there and it's just taken me a few days to get comfortable with that.   
 Q.  You said you've made a couple nice par putts. How important is that going into the weekend?  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, it's nice. I had a really good stretch of holes prior to that, so to just save par here and not drop a shot back is really important. Just to keep the momentum going into the weekend, it was really awesome to finish, I think I was like 5-under in that last stretch there, so it was really good.   
 Q.  Do you ever think about some of those things you did last year?  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, I think I did a little bit yesterday, probably more so than I should have. Now just going to try and go out and put as many birdies together as I can. I mean, I think that Hannah is playing exceptionally well right now, so there's still a lot of chase to do.   
 Q.  Yesterday did you feel more pressure because it was the first round, and today did you feel a little bit more relaxed?  
MARINA ALEX: I think so. Starting afternoons are sometimes hard in general, especially if you see how low the scores are in the morning, so you kind of go out and you're trying to, you know, get as many birdies as you can, and sometimes that puts pressure on. Plus, you know, dealing with coming back and defending. So I think there was like a lot of little things put together, and today I just felt a little bit more relaxed in every area.
