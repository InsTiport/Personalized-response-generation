 Q.  How did it feel to put yourself up at the top the leaderboard?  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, it was good.  It was a really good day.  Hit a lot of nice shots today and rolled some good putts.  Overall just really solid.  It was nice.   
 Q.  Were you playing aggressive today knowing...  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, for sure.  I mean, just have to play aggressive on the last day, especially -- I don't know where I started, maybe five back.   
So if you're hit ting it well you can really score low out here just using some of the slopes and getting the balls close to the hole.  But it's still a pretty challenging golf course.  Yeah, it was a good day overall.  Can't complain.   
 Q.  Hitting it well all week or today...  
MARINA ALEX: It's kind of progressively got better as the week went on.  It was a little scrappy to start the first two days, but I thought I putted pretty well the first couple days.  Made a lot of good saves for par and felt like I was stroking it well and just needed to be patient and hope that those putts were more birdie opportunities on the weekend, which they happened to be, and I was able to really just take some advantage this weekend just feeling like my game finally came together in the last two days.   
 Q.  No matter what happens, does this give you confidence?  
MARINA ALEX: For sure.  I had a great day today.  I mean, I think it was bogey-free.  It was nice to go into a Sunday and kind of have a clean card and just keep playing aggressive.
