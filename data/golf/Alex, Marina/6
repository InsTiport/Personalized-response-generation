Q. So six birdies today; did I get my math right?
MARINA ALEX: Yeah.
Q. A lot of them came on the back nine. You really turned it around. What kicked into gear for you?
MARINA ALEX: I made some really great putts. I made a nice up and down on 9. They moved the tee up so it was good to get a birdie there, because I had just made a bogey on 8. I was struggling with my ball striking a little still past couple days.
Made a really good putt on 10 for birdie.
What's 11? 11 made par.
12 holed a ridiculous bunker shot.
Yeah, so that kind of just kept the ball rolling, momentum.
And then hit a terrible chip on a par-5 from like in front of the green and made like a 35-foot putt for birdie. So it was kind of like a weird thing where -- I don't know, it did feel like it balanced out though in the sense that like should have made birdie from there so I did.
Q. Can't help but laugh at it.
MARINA ALEX: Yeah, no, I did. I did laugh at it.
And then hit some nice shots coming in. Left one out there on 16, the par-3. Hit an awesome iron into that and lipped out the putt for birdie.
Overall felt like I putted nicely, and my ball striking got a little bit better as the day went on. Hoping that I can just keep getting that a little better as the weekend goes on and see what happens.
