Q. I'm joined by New Jersey's own Marina Alex.  What a fantastic way to finish your U.S. Women's Open today.  How are you feeling?
MARINA ALEX: Really good, thank you.  It was a tremendous week.  I played some really, really great golf.  I had a tough stretch to start yesterday.  Other than that I really played super great, so I'm happy with it.
Q. After a double bogey on your round yesterday, you did not have any other hiccups.  It was all birdies and pars.  What was it that jump started your play there?
MARINA ALEX: I don't know.  I mean, I've been in experiences like this before.  I've done things like I did yesterday where I made doubles and bogeys and really dropped back.  Probably just nerves and putting pressure on myself so I just accepted it.  Let me just claw back the best that I can, not push it.  I know I can do that.  That's what I did.
I tried really hard not to freak out.  That was key to letting me get back -- my goal yesterday was -- I think I was at one point 3-over for the tournament.  I wanted to get back to red numbers by the end of the day.  If I did that, it would have been exceptional and I did.  From there I kind of kept pushing as far I could go.
Q. You made this course look easy.  What was it out there?  Was it the approach shots that came easy to you?  Were you holing longer putts?
MARINA ALEX: To start the day, I was ball striking really well.  I had a ton of birdie looks.  If you start mis-hitting irons and you start missing the green, it really becomes difficult.  I faced a little bit of that in the middle of my back nine.
I made a really great birdie on 12, I stuffed it to like a foot.  After that I got a bit wayward with my approach shots.  It becomes difficult.  I mean, it was a grind to finish out.  I had to make a ton of up-and-downs.  I made some unbelievable putts coming down the stretch.
Q. How important is this performance when you look forward to the rest of the season, the rest of the summer, some major championships coming up.  To do it all in front of your family and friends here?
MARINA ALEX: It's huge.  It's a ton of confidence for me to know that regardless of whether the putts were par or birdie or even for bogey to make them when they matter like that is incredible.  I'm hoping to build on that and tidy up the stuff that I felt like I was lacking in the back nine with my ball striking.  Continue to improve on that and hopefully those turn into birdies next time.
