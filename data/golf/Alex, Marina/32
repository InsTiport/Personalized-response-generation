 Q.  Not the way you wanted to finish, but it was a really good day.  
MARINA ALEX: Yeah.   
 Q.  How was it out there?  
MARINA ALEX: It was really good.  I feel like I was in control of myself for probably the first 15 holes.  I guess through when I made the eagle; then I got a little excited and kind of just knew I was a bit closer to the lead at that point.   
I missed a ton of birdie opportunities I felt like today.  I hit it well, left myself a lot of chances, and didn't really hole enough.  You know, something to just take from the day and just work on that.  Hopefully next time around just make a couple more putts.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Tell me about the eagle.  
MARINA ALEX: The eagle was cool.  They moved the tee forward, which was nice.  I hit a drive out there, decent drive, and then we had about like 220-ish to the hole.  I don't remember the exact number.   
So 3-wood into the wind on an uphill lie.  I didn't hit it great, but I was lucky it cleared the bunker.  I was left with such a tough chip because just the way the green was sloping.   
Just I tried to hit a pitch onto the front of the green with like as much spin as I could put on it, and it ended up just bouncing right in the hole.   
So it was great.   
 Q.  Looks like it's going to be your second Top 5 of the season.  It's still so early; how are you feeling about your game and where you are?  
MARINA ALEX: It's good.  It's interesting, how I finished in Australia was totally different.  I had two really great rounds Saturday and Sunday you just kind of crept up into the Top 5.   
This was a different experience playing in the last group yesterday and kind of been hanging around for two days.  There is a lot to learn from each.  To be able to put that all together will hopefully be the outcome at some point this year.
