  Q. How did it play differently from yesterday?
 MARINA ALEX:   Definitely easier today.  I mean, I know it was early, so just tough to get rolling right away.
 But the conditions were at least consistent yesterday; was tough in the afternoon.  There was a lot of weird -- the term we were using, the squalls.  Like the weather would come in, gust like crazy, rain, then die down.  Just tough to judge.
 Today was very consistent, so once you got a groove going you were just sticking with it.
 Q. Greens were probably a little nicer.
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah, they are.  It's great.  I don't know what changed, but they're firmer and I guess because of that, they are rolling a lot better throughout the day.  Even in the afternoon yesterday they were really good.  So that's a great change, whatever was decided on that.
 Q. Yeah.  Two years in the making, but how nice is it to have this event back on the schedule?
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah, I know, it's great.  It's good that we are basically rolling with a pretty full schedule, which is awesome.  It's nice to feel normal again.
 Q. Any of your four birdies stand out today?
 MARINA ALEX:   Let me think on that one.  I made three in a row early, which was awesome.  Almost made a hole-in-one on 3, so that was a little tap-in one-footer.  I had about ten or twelve feet on the next hole.  Made a really good putt there.
 And then I'm trying to -- I'm like brain dead.  Oh, the next hole after that was a really good -- I chunked my layup on the par-5 and I left myself way longer in.  You know what?  It actually worked out well because I didn't get as much spin on it with my 8-iron and I ended up having like another 10-footer.
 Yeah, so those were really solid.
 And then I had two really nice looks on 17 and 18 and didn't make them.  Hopefully tomorrow.
 Q. Obviously ANA is next week.
 MARINA ALEX:   Yes.
 Q. You want to play well here first.  Is that still in the back of your mind, maybe everybody's mind?
 MARINA ALEX:   Oh, yeah, definitely.  This is only my second tournament in about six months, so I really am happy to have more competitive reps under my belt.  Ocala was tough and I just was really rusty in a lot of ways, mentally, physically.
 I felt better going into this week.  I'm really happy that I have to practice 72 holes because it's been a long time.
 Q. What did you do with all the down time between competitive events?
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah, I mean, I was just rehabbing my back, which was -- I had a like a lower back injury.  That kind of came up actually at ANA last time we were there in September.  So, yeah, between ANAs I'll have played two tournaments.
 Q. Wow.  Feeling better though?
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah, definitely feeling better.  Gradually progressing.  It's good to be out here.  This course is really physically demanding, the walk is hard, and so far I'm hanging in there.  That is really good sign for my body and I'm happy with that.
 Q. Absolutely.  Especially going into next week where it's a little more flat.
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah, way more plat.  It is going to be hot, but I really need just the walk of 72 holes is going to be great for me this weekend.  I'm going to enjoy it, make the best of it, try and keep working on my game to get it sharp for the next week.
 Q. Does the coolness help?
 MARINA ALEX:   No.  It makes it worse.  I have a heat patch on right now and I had one on yesterday.  If it's not that warm tomorrow, probably put another one on.  Heat is good because my muscles get tight.  Just trying to keep loose is the key.  Really looking forward to Palm Springs.
 Q. I think the low is in the lower 80s.
 MARINA ALEX:   Perfect.  That's a dream.
 Q. Yeah.  I know you'll think about it probably later, but what's the game plan heading into the weekend?
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah, just keep building on what I've done the past two days.  I'm working with a new caddie which is great and we're working on our game plan.  I think it's all very process oriented stuff.  Just trying to get my game feeling a little bit more like the way it was before I kind of got hurt.
 It's just been a weird like 12 months in general.  I am just happy to feel competitive again?
 Q. When did you guys start working together?
 MARINA ALEX:   This week.
 Q. Just this week?
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah.  (Laughter.)  So, yeah.
 Q. So real brand new.
 MARINA ALEX:   So real brand new.  But we're doing great, and I'm happy about that and looking forward building on this.
 Q. How did you meet?
 MARINA ALEX:   Through another player.  He was kind of -- he was looking temporarily and so I was needing some help and so far so good.
 Q. Awesome.
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah.
 Q. Hopefully it continues.
 MARINA ALEX:   Yeah, thanks.
