RICK GEORGE:  Georgia Pacific and each of the towns we're in, it's an organization called Rebuilding Together and they make home repairs for low income families and do a great job.  They do a tremendous job.

ALAN THEIELMANN:  We're delighted with the sponsorship that we have.  The Grand Champions has been a wonderful thing for Georgia Pacific and great for our customers and hopefully the viewers are enjoying it.  We are associated with a real class act group of people.

Beyond that, we are continuing our sponsorship.  This is fiveÃ  years.  We started with Super Seniors and we're moving on from now at least for the next two years and probably well beyond.  So we're excited about that.  The Rebuilding Together is fun because it's been a partnership between the PGA TOUR and GP.  Over 8000 people wouldn't have had their homes this year if Rebuilding Together hadn't stepped in.  We play a small part in it, but we're proud of it.
DAVE MARR:  It was a wonderful effort, not just the Rebuilding Together, but also the scoring today, as far as the rest of the week as well.

ALAN THEIELMANN:  It's phenomenal.  These guys are absolutely terrific.  They're all class acts, like I've said.  Mike Hill has always been one of the my favorites.  He's a class act, has done a wonderful job representing the TOUR, and I'm just delighted I have something here to give him.

Mike, on behalf of Georgia Pacific, congratulations and well done on a fabulous round.
MIKE HILL:  Thank you.  It's a pleasure that Georgia Pacific is still in the program.  I think it's terrific and I've had great success with it.  And I certainly do appreciate it.
DAVE MARR:  It's your second win as far as the Georgia Pacific Grand Champions is concerned.  You're 17th overall, your second year‑end win.  You certainly have 18 Champions Tour victories, maybe you'd like another Grand Champion victory just to even that up 18 and 18.
MIKE HILL:  Dave, I thought I was going to retire, but after today and this week I may have to reconsider.  I may have to play a little more next year.
Q.  You played very well.  You would have played yourself into the final group if you were eligible.  If you take a look at the $86,000 that you won, it's equal to or actually greater than your three wins on the PGA Tour.  $85,000 for those three wins, $86,000 for this.

Did you ever think 66Ã  years old you would be playing for that kind of money?
MIKE HILL:  No, I never did.  And it just shows you how old I am, because in those years, you know, we played and won $30,000, and I thought it was terrific then, and obviously it's a lot better now.
DAVE MARR:  Congratulations.  Thank you, gentleman, very much.  Also take a look at the Grand Champions, not just the money you earned, but Rebuilding, a wonderful program all the way around, two more years.
