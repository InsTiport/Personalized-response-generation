 Q.
Congratulations.  I know they just mentioned it moments ago that this is your second win in the Georgia Pacific Grand Championship and you've also won the Charles Schwab Cup Championship two times.  Just share your thoughts.  You probably never get tired of winning, I guess. 
MIKE HILL:  No, I don't think you ever get tired of winning.  I guess I'm probably as surprised as a lot of people are here.  I haven't played very well this year.  This is, I believe, my 16th event.  I played good in Long Island again, and I won there, and I played good in Birmingham, but other than that, I haven't played very well at all.  I played good in San Antonio.  But this week I played as good as I've played in a long time.
Q.  How are the conditions out there today, especially with the rain and cooler weather?
MIKE HILL:  Well, when I woke up this morning and it was raining and cold.  My body isn't very good in the cold, so I thought that if I could shoot even par I would be very fortunate.  I started right off the first hole and hit it right in that big tree, and I was fortunate enough it dropped down in the fairway.  I made bogey there.  But after that things started happening better for me and I drove it in every fairway and I tried to just hit fairways and greens and it worked great.
Q.  Birdie at number ‑‑ just give us clubs and putts on No.Ã  2.
MIKE HILL:  No.Ã  2, I was just on the fringe and chipped in.
Q.  How far?  Any idea how far?
MIKE HILL:  I had about a 30‑foot chip shot.  And then I birdied No. 3.  I hit a 6‑iron about 4Ã  feet, and I made that one.  I made pars the rest of the way.

I birdied 11 from a foot.

I then bogeyed 14Ã  ‑‑ no 15, I bogeyed 15.  I drove it in the fairway, but I pulled my 6‑iron to the left of the green.  I wasn't able to get up and down.

And I then went and birdied 17 from 5Ã  feet, and 18 from 4Ã  feet.  I hit a 7‑iron at 17 and a 6‑iron at 128.
Q.  Obviously the weather here is usually pretty good, but over the years I'm sure you played in some bad weather.  Amateurs would say, "I'm not playing today."  You guys have to play.  Do you psych yourself up or do you play a different game and you try not to get as frustrated perhaps by the conditions?
MIKE HILL:  I think you need to have a lot of patience and I was able to have patience today.  I think this golf course, with the deep rough, made you have patience.  You needed to drive it in the fairway.  Everybody knows that.  If you don't drive it in the fairway, your chances of making a par are, I would guess, less than 50Ã  percent.  But I felt like when it continued to mist and rain and never got any warmer, I felt like everybody was going to have a hard time.  I felt like if I could hang in there and hit some greens and some fairways that I would have a chance at least of getting in a playoff, and I never dreamed I would get to 9‑under.  I thought if I could be 6‑under or even 5‑under, I would have had a good day.
Q.  Either a lot of gloves or extra towels.  What's your prescription for ‑‑
MIKE HILL:  Yes, my son caddies for me and he had six towels and I had a dozen gloves, and so we never got wet hands and we didn't get wet clubs.  That really helps.  I think it's harder on the caddie than it is on the player because they got to shuffle so many things trying to keep up and get the yardage and trying to get their books from getting wet.  I felt like Junior really did a great job.  He does every week, but today it was suburb.
Q.  Do you want another crack at this thing tomorrow?
MIKE HILL:  I've only played 15 events or 16 events, I guess, for the last four or fiveÃ  years.  I've contemplated not playing at all.  My wife told me that I have too much talent to just pull up and quit.  She said that I needed to at least play 10 or 11 tournaments.  And right now, next year, I'll probably play ‑‑ I'm not going to take retirement, but I'll probably play 15 or 16 again.
Q.  Quigley was saying, If I canÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t play golf here, I'd play golf at home.
MIKE HILL:  I don't do that.  I have a golf course, I have a farm, I run heavy equipment, I enjoy that.  That's my relaxation.  I dig ponds.  I don't play golf at all.  Those clubs won't see daylight until I go to Florida in February.  I'll start over again then, and sometimes I think that's better for you because you come with a clear head, even though the body isn't able to handle that as well as it once did.  I think that not playing every day, I don't practice, I think you only got so many shots in your body and I don't want to waste them on the practice tee.
Q.  Celebrate 25th anniversary (Inaudible) talk a little bit about the TOUR.
MIKE HILL:  I came here in 1989.  I just finished my 16th year.  Naturally I came with Chi Chi and Lee and Arnold and the guys that really could draw people.  We had what I thought ‑‑ and I would say I feel like I came at the right time.  I enjoyed my career.  We had a lot of fun when we were playing for $300,000 purses.  We didn't have to play for $2 million.  I felt like we had ‑‑ we could drink a beer in the locker room.  We could chide each other because it wasn't a big deal.

Now when you're talking about winning $300,000 to $400,000 a week, I see more guys in the fitness trailer than I do in the locker room, and I don't see anybody having a beer.

Have I seen it changing?  Yes, I've seen it really change.
Q.  I noticed when you were standing here that you have a wallet in your pocket and a money clip in your left pocket.  And I was wondering, why do you have that stuff when you play a round of golf?  Do most golfers do that, carry their wallets with them or leave them back in their locker?
MIKE HILL:  My wallet goes in my golf back.  My money clip stays on for identification purposes.  But my wallet is always in my golf bag when I play.  I wouldn't leave it in the locker room.  Chi Chi says he lost $8,000 in a tournament this year out of his locker.  I would have a hard time leaving my money and stuff in the locker.  You don't know who goes in there.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
MIKE HILL:  All of them have a little pouch they put their money and wallet in and they put it in their golf bag, and their caddie stays with the golf bag so that they don't lose that.
