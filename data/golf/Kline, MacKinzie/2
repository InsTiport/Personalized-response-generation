 Q.  What was the experience like? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  I'm sort of in awe.  It was fun.  My caddie and I, we had fun, so that's all that matters. 

 Q.  Was it harder than you thought it was going to be out there?  What exactly happened out there?  Nothing freaky? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  No.  Nothing clicking for me right now.  Right now I just don't think I'm hitting the ball great.  But it's okay.  Like I said, my caddie and I had fun.  We made jokes about it, so... 

 Q.  How was Maria and Eva? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  Yes.  They're really fun to play with actually.  I like them a lot and I can't wait to play with them again. 

 Q.  Kind of sum up the experience for me. 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  Oh, boy.  It was definitely exciting, but I was definitely nervous. 

 Q.  Were you nervous the whole way through or just the beginning? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  Probably the beginning I was more nervous than the other half of it, but it was fine. 

 Q.  What's the thing you're going to most remember about this round? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  Oh, boy, probably the golf course and how it plays and how you have to either hit the fairways or you're kind of in trouble. 

 Q.  Yeah.  You were having trouble hitting the fairways. 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  Yes.  No, I was having trouble hitting the fairways.  But it's a nice golf course.  It's just a beautiful golf course. 

 Q.  Anything stick out as far as a shot you hit or, you know, just (indiscernible) with your caddie or anything like that? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  I told him on like, what was it, on the Front 9 that we played that, Okay.  Go right for this part of the house. 
 Because I hadn't been hitting the fairways all day, so I just looked at him and said, Let me just try to keep it straight and keep it in play right now.  Like let me just keep it in play right now, and he just laughed at me.  It was fun.  We just tried to make it fun and funny.  It was really fun. 

 Q.  What was your caddie's name again? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  Hugh Montgomery, but I call him S.C.
