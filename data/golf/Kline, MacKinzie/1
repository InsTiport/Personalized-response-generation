 Q.  (Indiscernible.) 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  Of course.  It was so much fun playing.  It's exciting.  It's a beautiful golf course and a great track.  It was incredible. 

 Q.  Is it solidified that this is (indiscernible) of your career? 
  MACKINZIE KLINE:  Absolutely.  You know, it's so much fun to be able to play golf and also to raise money for the Children's Heart Foundation is so much fun. 
 But this is definitely what I want to do with my life. 

 Q.  Is harder or easier playing out here with the best women in the world? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  I think it's harder.  Definitely harder just because it was my first LPGA tournament.  And it was hard.  It was difficult, but it was really, really fun. 

 Q.  So what's next for you? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  For me I'm going to go to the US Open junior qualifier and see how I do there. 

 Q.  Okay.  What do you take away from this week?  Are there certain things that you now think, I've got to work on this, I've got to work on the mental part, the physical part, what part do you take away? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  I learned a lot from the LPGA ladies.  They're very nice ladies.  I loved the ladies who I played with.  I'm just going take away the experience and having fun and work harder at it and just keep helping the Children's Heart Association through raising a $1 million for them. 

 Q.  Were the greens any faster than you expected? 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  They're very nice.  The greens were fast and tricky, but I liked them a lot. 

 Q.  You had a nice big crowd here, family and friends. 
 MACKINZIE KLINE:  Yeah.  All my family.  It was so nice to see them.  I haven't seen them in years.  It was really cool.
