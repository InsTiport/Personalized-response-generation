   REBECCA HUDSON: I'm disappointed that I three-putted the last but really pleased that I played well. I played the course well even though the wind was coming from a different direction. We plotted well. I went in a bunker and still made par so I'm very pleased. 

 Q.  What happened with that putt? Was it one you hadn't practised? 
 REBECCA HUDSON: No I did do. It was a bad putt, but anyway. 

 Q.  Were you nervous? 
 REBECCA HUDSON: No, I was quite relaxed. It just didn't go where I thought it would go. I went in one bunker on ten but managed to get out and made par so I'm very pleased. Level par - I would have taken that at the beginning of the day. 

 Q.  Was it a long day? 
 REBECCA HUDSON: Extremely long. We were on 14 and we passed a group on five.
