 Q.   Is this the best round you ve played here?  
LUCAS BLACK:   This is the best round I ve ever played here at Edgewood.  
  
 Q.   What do you think your chances are atwinning?  
LUCAS BLACK:   I feel pretty good. I take it one step at a time and try to get as many birdies as I can. I m excited for tomorrow. You can t win it on the first day but you can lose it and I m happy to be in contention.  
  
 Q.   Do you feel any extra pressure now that you re in second place?  
LUCAS BLACK:   I put pressure on myself and strive to get better every day. Hopefully I give myself enough opportunities to get a lot of birdies.
