 Q.  Not quite the low round you might have wanted, but you're still within striking distance. How do you feel after that one?  
JB HOLMES: Yeah, I mean I caught some bad breaks today. On 9 I hit a spike mark on about a 5-footer that was right in the middle and kicked it left. I hit the middle of the green with a 6-iron on 12 and it somehow rolls in the water. So just, I just hung in there and towards the end made a couple birdies, so gave myself a chance for tomorrow and that's really what we're shooting for.   
 Q.  After going in the water did it feel good to bounce back with a couple birdies on the way in?  
JB HOLMES: I mean it's always nice to make a couple birdies, yeah. It's just frustrating to hit -- I pretty much hit it where I wanted to, my ball landed very similar to where Wyndham's did and mine went in the water and his didn't. So just frustrating to hit a pretty good shot and get penalized for it.   
 Q.  Given that it's been a rough few months for you leading into this week do you rely on some of the memories from victories here going into tomorrow?  
JB HOLMES: I mean, you always have good feelings when you come here, so, yeah, you try to remember the great shots you hit here and all the success you had, so, yeah, you can look at that going into tomorrow and we'll see what happens.
