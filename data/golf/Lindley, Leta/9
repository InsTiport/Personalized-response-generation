LETA LINDLEY:   No. 1, I had 175, 170 into the hole.  So I hit 7-wood and pitched over and didn't get up-and-down.  I hit a poor chip.  No. 3, the par  3, I don't think what it was playing today, 140-something.  I hit a 7-iron to about nine feet and made that.  No. 5, I hit a 9-wood in.  I had about 165.  And then No. 13, I had about 145.  I hit a half-7 to about seven feet and made that.  15, the par  3, I hit 6-iron in.  We had 165 to the hole, and I hit -- to about a 20-footer.  No.  17, I had  -- it was like 180 yards into the wind and I hit a 5-wood, badly, and failed to get up-and-down from the bunker. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:   I don't even know who is there aside from Dottie.  Who are the other two?  Oh, okay.  I'm in good company.  Very good company.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:   I'm excited.  I'm comfortable.  No need to get too anxious, I guess.  We still have two more rounds with a lot of golf to be played.  And I'm excited to be there.  I came into this tournament hoping to, you know, put myself in position to win.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:   Yeah, especially since I woke up this morning and I had a pinch in my neck and I didn't have full range of motion.  And I came in early and worked with Keith in the HealthSouth trailer, and he worked on me for 45 minutes, trying to rub it out.  And it didn't  -- I mean it helped a little bit, but I was very restricted at the top and I couldn't get it quite in the position that I wanted to.  And it loosened up a little bit over the course of the day, but for me it was just a matter of survival today, and just trying to get through and hoping that my neck would feel better tomorrow.  Sleeping, yeah, I woke up.  I couldn't believe it.  This happens to me a couple times a year.  I have very poor timing.  I mean, why not next week?  I woke up and you feel it instantly, and there's nothing that you can do and you just hope that it will let go.  Like please, let go, let go.  It's just like a knot.  It's just really angry, and it's all in a knot right here and people have been trying to rub it out, and before you know it it's running down behind your shoulder blade and behind your neck.  And when you can't turn your head all the way to the right or turn your head all the way to the left, you need to be able to move a little bit to play golf.  Right, for checkers, it's okay. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:   I played it right of the flag knowing the wind was coming a little bit from the right, and, you know, it was a really strong, strong wind.  You know, I just put a poor swing on it.   Certainly, I was trying to leave it a little right of the flag and just draw it in there, and I either got caught or I came over the top of it and it was a terrible shot.  It was the worst shot I hit all day.  I mean, it was a tough hole when we were coming in  -- if we had been there 20 minutes earlier, that hole would have been down winds.  And all of the sudden, it was like the storm was coming in.  And instead of it being downwind, it was like playing two-clubs into the wind, and it is a long hole to begin with without wind.  Just a poor shot, bad timing.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:   Yes.  I mean, it was windy and then it would stop, and then it would rain and then it would stop and the wind would pick up again.  It's just one of those goofy days we had, among all of the elements today out there.  And that's probably why the scores were not so low, aside from Juli's 66.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:  Dottie, she said that to me when we were walking off the 18th green.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:   Well, I'm just excited.  Whoever is there, I'm excited.  I mean, it's nice to be in the company of Meg, Annika, and Dottie, and to put my name in the same sentence.  But, you know, I've worked hard and I learn earned my way here to be in the Top -30, and I know that I can play and play good golf.  So I'm excited.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:   Well, I hit it really well yesterday, and considering how I felt today, I was striking the ball really solid and hitting it a little further than I normally do, giving it that little extra.  I think that I have really good timing right now.  Testing my caddy a little bit when all of the sudden you're hitting like five yards further.  And I putted pretty well.  So my goal is, obviously, to continue to hit fairways and continue to hit greens.  The greens are small enough that if you hit the green, you're going to have a birdie opportunity.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
LETA LINDLEY:   Just about.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hit just about every club today.  Right.  I hit a lot of 6-irons, a lot of 7-irons, 11- and 9-woods.  But, you're right, I think that I did hit just about every club.
