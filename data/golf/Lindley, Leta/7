PAUL ROVNAK:  Leta, tell us what you hit in and how far the putt was?
LETA LINDLEY:  
I had about 65 yards on No. 3.  I had my 56 degree sand wedge.
Q.   How far is that putt?
LETA LINDLEY:  
That putt was about 4 feet.

7, I had 130 yards.  I hit 9 iron.  That putt was about ten feet.

15, I had 76 yards.  I had my 56 degree sand wedge.  Again, that putt was about three feet.
Q.  You had three birdies today, no bogeys, everything else pars.  The wind is blowing out there, how did you find it so easy?
LETA LINDLEY:  
I don't know that I found it easy.  I missed it in the right spots.  I got lucky.  I think it was a day where everything went my way.  I made a couple good par saves.  Just tried to make as many birdies as I could before the rain comes tomorrow, and the golf course plays 4 clubs longer.
Q.  You play a lot of woods, don't you?
LETA LINDLEY:  
I am wood girl, yes.
Q.  So the bad weather, like you say, more clubs, is that a good thing necessarily, bad thing?
LETA LINDLEY:  
If it was long, it is long for anybody.  Maybe that is to my advantage with a good short game.  I think you can play any golf course if you are hitting it well and putting well.  I try not to dwell on the length of the golf course and play it as I find it.  Whatever it is, it is.  Just get in the hole.
Q.  
Is the course set up almost like a major in terms of the difficulty?  Did it feel like that today?
LETA LINDLEY:  
I don't know the rough is as high as we would find it at a US Open or LPGA Championship.  I found the fairways to be drier than they were on Tuesday.  I was backing up my drives on Tuesday.  I found it surprisingly dry today.
Q.  Did I hear you say that you were going to frame it because it doesn't have any fives on it?
LETA LINDLEY:  
It doesn't.  I didn't make any bogeys, so that was really nice.  I felt like I was due for a round like that soon.
Q.  You can't frame it.  LPGA keeps that card.
LETA LINDLEY:  
They do keep that card.  I will keep this one for my scrapbook.
Q.  It is fair to say that you are slightly built.
LETA LINDLEY:  
I am on the slight side, yes (laughing).
Q.  I am going to ask the question that you are not supposed to ask a woman:  How much do you weigh?
LETA LINDLEY:  I honestly have not weighed myself after having my so Cole 14 months ago.  I try not to.  I didn't want to weigh myself; I go by how my clothes fit.

I am happy with where I am.  I think I come back to pre pregnancy size.  I guess I was 117 before Cole was born.  Probably back around there.
Q.  So if the course does get long, it could be a little bit challenging, how many woods do you carry in your bag?
LETA LINDLEY:  
I care six woods:  11, 9, 7, 5, 3, driver.  You know, sure, it will play longer, but I am good with my woods.  So I am not    I can't be overly concerned about it.  I have to play the course as I find it.  If I have to chip and putt from in front of the green, then I will do that.
Q.  How do you balance having a young child and being out there?  Does he travel with you a lot?
LETA LINDLEY:  
He does.  My husband caddies for me.  We all travel together as a family.  This morning he was a little ornery.  It is challenging for sure.  I am lucky that my husband travels with me.  I can't imagine traveling out here with Cole and not having any help.  He has certainly brought a lot of joy to our lives.  It has been such a blessing.  I don't know if any of you are parents.  I am sure you can understand.  Golf isn't as important.  My husband and I have created this wonderful life.  He has really been a blessing.
Q.  Do you have extended family help when you are playing, if you guys are both out on the course?
LETA LINDLEY:  
We have daycare.  We have daycare here on Tour.  It is fantastic.  We have three ladies that travel with us full time.  From the day I put him in there for the first time, I never once worried about it.  I know he is in wonderful hands.  Let me tell you he didn't protest this morning when we dropped him off.  We weren't paying enough attention to him.
Q.  Is it the same three women?
LETA LINDLEY:  
Same three women and then volunteers.
Q.  He should recognize them by now?
LETA LINDLEY:  
Yes.  He loves it there, with all the kids.  It is a great opportunity.
Q.  
When you look at someone like Juli Inkster, who has teenage kids, can you imagine being that competitive and that accomplished as a family as she has through the years?
LETA LINDLEY:  
She has done an amazing job and her girls are wonderful, if you have had a chance to meet them.  I take it one year at a time, see how Cole adjusts.  Obviously that will be my priority, if it means that I travel on my own for a while or retire or whatever, I take it one year at a time.  What Juli and Nancy Lopez and all those moms have done and played a high level of golf, obviously that is an ultimate goal.
Q.  You would retire?
LETA LINDLEY:  
I don't know.  I have to take it when I am faced with that decision.  It would be hard to give up.  I enjoy the competitiveness.  I would never put my son's life in    if it was harming him, then he would come first.
Q.  This will be the first Mother's Day that you are playing in a tournament?
LETA LINDLEY:  
Yes.
Q.   Any thoughts on that?
LETA LINDLEY:  I want to be playing on Mother's Day.  I would like to be winning on Mother's Day.  I can't think of a better day to win a golf tournament.
Q.  Annika has been a part of the conversation for so long this year and throughout her career, is it surprising that she shot 76 day?
LETA LINDLEY:  
I am surprised.  Sure I am.  I mean, I expect wonderful things out of her.  She is, what can I say, she is Annika.  She is one of the greatest golfers in LPGA history and in golf history.  I am surprised to hear that.  I would expect her to come back and fire at it tomorrow.  Wouldn't be surprised if she shot a low number tomorrow, even in bad weather.
Q.  You just said you expect her to be there somehow, some way?
LETA LINDLEY:  
It is only one round, a lot can happen in three more rounds.  I would not count her out by any means.  It changes the dynamic when she is not at the tournament.
Q.  What is that like?
LETA LINDLEY:  
What is that like?  Well, I guess you feel like you have a better chance.  You know, she is a machine.  You know you have to play well.  For me my super duper best golf ever.  You know, which can surely happen.  She is just not going to make mistakes.  She is not going to give it to you by any means; I have to go after her.
Q.  I don't think you would do it because of Cole, but do people pick and choose tournaments saying, she is not playing this week?
LETA LINDLEY:  
No.  No.  Absolutely not.  You know, if it happens she is not there, she is not there.  I didn't choose my schedule around Annika.  I pick tournaments that are my favorites and are set up well for my game.  I can't worry about what Annika is doing; I have got my hands full.
Q.  Are you playing in the Sybase this year?
LETA LINDLEY:  Yes.
PAUL ROVNAK: 
Any more questions for Leta?  Thank you.
