 Q.  Obviously a disappointing way to finish last week but now you've had a chance to reflect.  You must take a lot of positives about the way you played over the course of last week in Turkey?  
LI HAOTONG: It is.  It takes a lot -- I took a lot of positive stuff from there.  I'm proud of myself, the way I finished and just a little bit of mistake Sunday happened, but I don't mind.  I'm not worried about my game.  My game is in good shape now.  Looking forward to the next two weeks.   
 Q.  Turning attentions to this week at the Nedbank, you had a good week here last year, crowned by that fantastic 64 on Sunday, best round of the week?  
LI HAOTONG: It is.  I didn't really miss a shot on Sunday.  A little bit disappointed on the last putt was like six-foot for the new course record.   
Anyway, it's a good finish there, so it's a lot of positives taking into this week and hopefully have a good week here.   
 Q.  Great course in Turkey last week.  How does it compare to this and how different will conditions be this week?  
LI HAOTONG: I think quite different, especially the grass.  This is more like kikuyu.  I think you're going to have a lot of flyers if you're in the semi rough, and you have to hit really solid tee shots, as last week.  Obviously you have to putt well.  Hopefully I can play well.   
 Q.  Just coming towards the end of the year, you got that fantastic win in Dubai when you beat Rory McIlroy, how do you sum up the way this year has been for you in total?  
LI HAOTONG: It is very, very good year for me so far, and actually I just make a new record on The Race to Dubai, which is really good.  I mean, like I said, just have to stay positive, and just need to play my best.
