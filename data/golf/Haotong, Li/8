Q. How pleased are you with the way you started?
LI HAOTONG: Actually a couple shots dropped but played really solid and I played really, really good until hole No. 16.  Because before then, I was thinking, oh, only missed one green and as soon as I realised that, I missed two greens in a row.  I was quite disappointed but very pleased to have the score.
Q. How pleasing was the eagle on 12?
LI HAOTONG: Yeah, that was quite nice.  Chip-in from there and also on No. 10, first driver in the water and chip-in for par.
Q. You've had a great few weeks and great results.  How nice is it to be taking that form now into three big Rolex Series Events at the end of the season?
LI HAOTONG: Yeah, want a strong finish to the season, and pretty much I did, you can see the last three weeks is pretty solid results.  I bring a lot of confidence from there and hopefully have a good three weeks.
