Q. You work hard and grind; is that a representation of what today was?
LI HAOTONG: It is. I think especially my driver wasn't work very well today and a lot of times in the rough. So to be fair, at the end of the day I can get this result is quite nice for myself.
Q. You're in a very, very good position going into Saturday, aren't you?
LI HAOTONG: It is. I'm still there. So I'm going to work on my game a little bit on the driving range later and hopefully hit it straight again and smash the course.
Q. How easy is it to keep calm when things aren't going well? Do you talk to your caddie? Do you want to explode? Do you just say, I can deal with this?
LI HAOTONG: I had a few times nearly there, but glad I holed myself good. I think I just need to stay patient in the next few days and think I will be good.
Q. What would it mean to win?
LI HAOTONG: I mean, means a lot as a Chinese. You know, it's always I dream about that. So hopefully I can do that.
