 Q.  Final round 67, you must be very pleased with that?  
LI HAOTONG: Yes, very exciting and very happy to have shot 67 in such a big event.   
 Q.  You missed the cut here last year the first time you played it.  Did you learn something that you brought into this year?  
LI HAOTONG: I think just work on a lot since last year.  Since last year, I think it's the first week I work with my coach, Jamie Gough.  He helped me a lot and I've just been stable a lot.   
 Q.  No dropped shots today and not many people have done that on this golf course this week?  
LI HAOTONG: Yeah, I played really, really solid the last couple days.  I just missed two greens today and actually missed at least five or six times inside 12 feet.   
So I mean, just gave me a lot of confidence.  Hopefully I can do great on putting a little bit.   
 Q.  And nice to finish in a Rolex Series event, new high-profile event, to finish in the Top-10?  
LI HAOTONG: Yes, so pleased.
