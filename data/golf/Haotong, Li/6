 Q.  Thoughts on the finish?  
LI HAOTONG: A tough day for me honestly and I holed a couple chances, but not until the end, the first playoff, I saw that ball definitely go in, but a little bit too much.   
 Q.  Rosey said yesterday this was going to be a difficult day.  Can you just talk about what it's like to be in the hunt?  You did it earlier this season against Rory and against world-class players.  
LI HAOTONG: Yeah, it's a pretty good round, especially against Rosey, and such a nice guy.  Hopefully next time I can play better.   
 Q.  It's difficult to talk about, I know, but you have to take the positives of what's been a really good week for you here.  
LI HAOTONG: It's a tough day for me.  I think I played well the whole week, but didn't hole a few putts on the last and that was it.   
 Q.  And overall now, looking forward to taking that form into the end of the season?  
LI HAOTONG: Yeah, for sure.  Hopefully I can have a better finish on the season.
