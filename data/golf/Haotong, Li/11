LI HAOTONG: Yeah, it's pretty fun, but first few holes gave me some hard times.  But good thing is to stay patient, and a lot of happy energy today.   
 Q.  You sound tired and frustrated, but there are so many good, positive things, aren't there?  
LI HAOTONG: No, frustrating is way better than last week still.  Pretty happy, and played well on the back side.   
 Q.  I know we touched on this yesterday, but why this transition, so quick from one week to another, or is that just golf?  
LI HAOTONG: I think probably just because last week played too bad, and nothing to lose, and just play well.   
 Q.  Does this course suit you, though?  Is this one that you really liked the minute you saw it?  
LI HAOTONG: Right, right.  Really like this weather, and the course is very fit me actually.  I think I can keep playing well.   
 Q.  What do you think of playing a shot off the roof of a villa at the 16th?  
LI HAOTONG: 16th?  Oh, is really good, but I missed left two days in a row.  But pretty good, pretty decent tee box.  I like that.   
 Q.  Does golf need that sort of thing?  Do you need something new?  
LI HAOTONG: Yes, yes, I need something special.  I need something fun, definitely.  Hopefully in the future can see more tee boxes like that.
