Q. A couple of early birdies really set the tone for what was a great round from you today?
HAOTONG LI: It is pretty solid round, I think whole day, but I had a couple -- had a few bad iron shot, which is like No. 9, No. 12, No. 13.
Q. How do you like playing this golf course?  Obviously it's a very special event, this DP World Tour Championship.  Do you enjoy playing this golf course?
HAOTONG LI: Yeah, this is my third time in a row and every time come here just so enjoy that place, enjoy the result.  Of course, very pleased at the score today.
Q. We've seen you do a lot of practise this week.  Have you worked on anything specific for this golf course?
HAOTONG LI: Well, actually, not really, you didn't see last few weeks.  I didn't really practise this week as much, as much as before.  I think water park yesterday afternoon didn't helps a lot.
Q. This big event, you're in good form, how nice would it be to finish on a good note with a good finish here?
HAOTONG LI: For sure.  Hopefully I can finish in the Top-10 in Race to Dubai and hopefully can win this week, be great.
Q. Who did you to go the water park with?
HAOTONG LI: With my dad, which is like 65 years old, and I said, "Come on, this is one of the best in the world."
He said, okay, okay, okay, and he enjoyed it, and I was like, oohh, yeah.
Never been there before.  The big slide, the most big slide.  And soon as I go there, my dad said, yeah, just don't think about, it just go there and I was like, yeah, it's fine.  It's only 50 metres straight down there and he's kind of a little bit scared.  I got him, finally.
