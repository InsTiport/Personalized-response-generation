 Q.  A 64 to add to a 65.  How was it out there today?  
JENS FAHRBRING: Yeah, it was good.  I felt a bit tired early in the round but was able to get a good start, birdied the first three holes.  After that, got into my rhythm and managed to play well all 18 holes.   
 Q.  What was the key to your round today?  
JENS FAHRBRING: You know, I've been hitting my driver well.  And out here on some holes, the rough isn't that thick, so you can take advantage of that.  Just hit it as hard as you can on some holes.  But I'm hitting my wedges okay and you know, been rolling in a few putts, so that's nice.   
 Q.  The greens were quite soft yesterday.  Did they firm up at all?  
JENS FAHRBRING: Maybe slightly firmer but it's still quite soft out there.   
 Q.  You're tied 174th in the Order of Merit, and tied second at the moment, and you need to obviously be in the top three or two, are you feeling positive about the weekend?  
JENS FAHRBRING: Yeah, that's sort of my goal this week, nothing to lose.  I thought I pretty much had to win to get into the top 110.  So yeah, I need to go out and make birdies and try to win.   
 Q.  How are you going to prepare for the weekend?  
JENS FAHRBRING: Oh, like all the other days, just same routine, same warm up, same everything, really.  It's just need to go out with the mind-set of, you've got to birdie the first hole and see if I can do that.  Should be a challenge.
