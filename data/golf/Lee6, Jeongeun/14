 Q.  6-under par round today.  What went well for you?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  First nine holes, I made a pretty good putt, so that's why I made straight four birdies.  So I was pretty satisfied with that.  But from the back nine, my shots were kind of a little bit shaky, but I think I did pretty good so far, yeah.   
 Q.  Have you ever played in conditions like you faced out there today?  There was a little bit of everything?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  I'm used to it.  There's a lot of suspensions back when I used to play on the KLPGA, and I'm used to that, and the weather conditions, as well.   
 But so far, I'm pretty lucky that I was able to play in the afternoon, because this morning, like it was so windy.  It was extremely, like really bad.  So pretty happy with it.  Pretty lucky.   
 Q.  You said this is the first time you've really played links golf.  How are you liking it?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  I mean, it's my first time playing a links golf course.  I personally think it's really, really hard, but I did pretty well with my putting stroke and that's why my scores are better.   
 Q.  Putting was the key?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  Putting was good.
