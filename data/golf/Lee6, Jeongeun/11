Q. It was a very, very good round today. You've never played here before. What is it about this course that made you so comfortable?
JEONGEUN LEE6: This is my first time playing on this golf course, but I was surprised the greens were pretty fast, and then the fairways are all narrow, and so I just have to focus on my tee shots and hit it accurately as much as I can. Today I wasn't really satisfied with a couple of my shots, but I tried my best, and I played well.
Q. You had an eagle on your front nine. Tell me about what happened there.
JEONGEUN LEE6: When I hit my tee shot, my ball was in the rough, and it wasn't a really easy lie. It wasn't really easy to hit. But when I hit my second shot, my shot was pretty accurate and it was pretty good, so I was pretty satisfied with it.
Q. So was it a short putt there? What was the putt?
JEONGEUN LEE6: Very short, one meter.
Q. What has this whole season been like for you? We're coming up to the end. It's been a very strong season. What are your biggest learnings about yourself this year?
JEONGEUN LEE6: You know, all the courses that I've played this year, I never played in my entire life, but I feel like my golf management has been improving, and playing with a lot of good players, it just makes me feel like kind of learning from them, from their experiences, and so I feel pretty grateful about that.
