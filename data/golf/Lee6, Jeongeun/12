Q. 1-under final round today.  How did you play out there?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  You know, my shots were pretty good, especially my approach shots on most of the holes but my putting was kind of a little bit shaky and so I'm kind of a little bit -- I could have done a little bit better on the green.
Q. Can you sum up your week and your experience here in Scotland, playing links for the first time?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  You know, when I was in Korea, there's not a lot of links course and so I played it a lot differently this week.  Overall I'm pretty satisfied with all my scores and shots, and so I think this is kind of a good -- a lot of good memories and playing the first time on a links golf course.
Q. It's been a long stretch.  What are you going to do for your off-week next week?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  Next week we are going to go to Canada and I'm going to have three days off, and going to go on a trip to Niagara Falls with my manager.  So I'm going to have fun and just take a lot of good rest.
