 Q.  54 holes, three rounds here at ANA.  Talk about your round today.  
JEONGEUN LEE: (Through translation.)  The first round I shot 1-under but the second and third round, I mean, I could have done better, could have played better.   
I think today my score comparing to other rounds like today, 1-under, I think that was the best score for me today, so...   
 Q.  Talk about playing with Lexi.  
JEONGEUN LEE: (Through translation.)  Playing with Lexi, I mean, it was really great.  It was great playing with her.  There were a lot of galleries, which was pretty cool, and watching her playing, too, as a rookie player.   
 Q.  Did you take anything away from her?  What did you learn about her play or were you focusing more on your game?  
JEONGEUN LEE: (Through translation.)  I was pretty much focusing on myself.  I didn't pretty much watching the other players.   
So watching Lexi, I mean, hitting her driver pretty far, I mean, she bombs her driver, so I think that's a really cool thing to watch.   
 Q.  You're just a couple shots back from the leaders.  What are you going to focus on going into tomorrow's final round?  
JEONGEUN LEE: (Through translation.)  I want to improve my par-5 pretty much because there is a couple shots like I was kind of a little bit upset.  But I'm going to focus on par-5 tomorrow, play well, make birdie as much as I can.   
Right now my putting stroke and everything has been improved and everything is good so far, so tomorrow I'm going to prepare more my next round.
