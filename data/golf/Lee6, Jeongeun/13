 Q.  5-under par round.  What went well for you today?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  So today the weather was pretty nice so far, and then also, all my iron shots were pretty good.  I'm pretty satisfied with it.  Last time I told you guys that I kind of wanted to draw more than fading, so yeah, I made so many birdie chances most of the holes, and so yeah, I'm pretty satisfied with all my shots.   
 Yesterday it was raining a lot, but today I think like the temperature was kind of cold, so all the fairways and greens are pretty firm.  So yeah, everything was pretty firm so far and a little bit of windy.   
 Q.  Were you expecting to play this well on a links golf?  Are you surprised with how well you're playing on your first time on a links?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  This is my first time, and I thought it would be really hard, but actually my shots and my putting strokes were pretty good.  So that's why I've been starting playing a lot better than before.  But the most part I'm worried about is tomorrow's weather, because it seems like the forecast, it's going to rain all day.  So we'll see how that goes.   
 Q.  What will be your strategy for the final round, knowing weather could be a factor?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  I just try not to think about it too much.  Not to go for everything.  So I'm going to try my best as much as I can, even though it's going to be windy tomorrow and raining, but I'm going to hit all my shots pretty low trajectory.   
 Also, I'm going to -- when the weather gets pretty cold and windy, and your body feels super tense, I'm going to feel loose as much as I can.
