 Q.  Saturday at the U.S. Open is usually moving day, and you got 2 under par, very good score.  Tell us what was the best part of your game today to make the 2 under par score?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  So today, I know I had a one hole that I made a three-putt, which is bogey.  But other than that, my back nine, I finished pretty strong, and I finished 2 under.   
 Q.  As the leaderboard stands, you are two strokes behind, and there were two or three 65s today.  What do you think you need to do to be the champion at the end of the day tomorrow?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  So I feel like tomorrow, I know the green is going to be faster, and I'm going to focus more on my second shot, my approach shot, pretty much.   
 And yes, I'm going to pretty much probably going to focus more on the green, short game for tomorrow, my putter.   
 Q.  Are you better at having the lead and having people chase you, or are you better coming from behind?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  I mean, she doesn't feel too much about it.  I mean, yes, it's going to be a little bit tense when she's almost on the board, but -- leaderboard, but I know U.S. Open is one of the most hardest Major tournaments she ever played, but she's going to think positive.   
 Q.  Good luck tomorrow.  Thank you for your time.  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  Thank you.
