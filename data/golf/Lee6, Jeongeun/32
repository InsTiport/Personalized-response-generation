 Q.  You had a rough start, but you seemed to even out the round.  How did you do it?  
 JEONGEUN6 LEE:  So started out the day, I didn't fell so well, condition wise.  What I tried to do was stay at even, which actually worked out.  It was 1-over but I'm satisfied with the result.   
 Q.  How do you feel about still being near the top of the leaderboard with one round to go?  
 JEONGEUN6 LEE:  The pin placements were pretty tough today.  If I hang in there tomorrow just like I did today, I think I will do well.
