Q. U.S. Women's Open champion, Jeongeun Lee6 here, in the lead after round two.  What part of your game a working well for you too?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  (Through translation.)  My putter and shot I been practicing a lot this week, and even last week as well.  But lately the first and second rounds I did pretty good, of my putt experience shots started kind of improving.
Glad that today I didn't make my 3-putts.  So I'm pretty satisfied with it.
Q. How is the course set up for your game and how did you take advantage of that?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  (Through translation.)  It was pretty good.  The course, you know, the green was not too soft, not too firm.  It was pretty good so far.  It was so easy to play with my second shot in order to control my shots so far.  Satisfied with it.
Q. So you're at the top of the leaderboard tied with another player.  What does that do for your confidence going into the weekend?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  (Through translation.)  So I kind of wanted to play consistently as well, play well as much as I can.  You know, especially the greens, like I said, like it's not too soft, not too firm, and I think I can control the shots and I think I can play well tomorrow.
So, yeah, then also I should think about the putting green speed-wise.
