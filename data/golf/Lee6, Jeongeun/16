Q. It's your first time in this tournament, your debut, four birdies, no bogeys.  Tell me about your round today.
JEONGEUN LEE6:  Yeah, I mean, the result was -- I'm pretty satisfied with the results, but actually it was kind of -- I was kind of a little bit struggling with my shots and putting because the greens and fairways were kind of a little bit difficult for me.  So I'm going to try to practise more out there after this round.
Q. What did you find difficult about the greens and the fairways?  Was it the type of grass?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  Yeah, especially if I wanted a tee shot, I just needed to focus on where to target accurately so that I could avoid the trees because there's so many trees out there, like a lot of tall trees.  Yeah, that's the most part that I've been focusing.  And also the green, it was way too soft.  It wasn't kind of firm, so it was kind of difficult to putt.
Q. Now that you've won a major, how much more comfortable are you at a major?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  Yeah, so I feel like I've been more focusing than the other tournaments obviously because it's like the last major tournament, so I kind of feel like I wanted to play well than the other tournaments.  I did pretty good at ANA and U.S. Women's Open.  I know I didn't play well last week, so this is my last tournament, and so I feel like I want to finish strong as much as I can.
