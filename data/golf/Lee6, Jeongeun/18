Q. Jeongeun Lee6, 2-Under on the day.  Couple strokes back from the lead.  How was your round today?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  (Through translation.)  Today my tee shot was not very good, especially my iron shots.  It was so hard to control my shots, and so, yeah, there weren't a lot of birdies today.
So tomorrow I'm going to focus on tee shots and my iron shots.
Q. How much was wind a factor in your game today?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  (Through translation.)  Yeah, it didn't affect me too much, but when the wind is blowing so hard I started to swing pretty fast and my swing started feeling kind of short.
So, yeah, just try my best as I can.
Q. What will your game plan be like for tomorrow?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  (Through translation.)  Tomorrow I just want to focus on my iron shots.  Like I said, my tee shots were not that great, so I'm going to focus on where I want to land it at and just control my iron shots, hit the best shots I can.
