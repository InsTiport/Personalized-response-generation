 Q.  How do you feel to play this week?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6: I had came to China for a winter training camp a long time ago. It's good to come back to China, especially first time in Shanghai. The course and greens are good enough. The weather is also good for playing golf, so I think I can play in the best condition. It's been a long time since I've been playing, so I want to play well.   
 Q.  How have you been during your break?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6: To be honest, I didn't take a good rest. I had a lot of schedules and meeting my friends while I practiced. But the energy consumption is way different to playing in competitions. So I think I can play in good condition this week.   
 Q.  What's your goal this week?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6: I feel very confident in my shots and putts as I rested. I was very tired to playing in tournament for four months, but now I feel much better. I hope that I will be at least the top 10 or having a chance to win this week.
