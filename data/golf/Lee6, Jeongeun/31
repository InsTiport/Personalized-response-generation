Q. For your round today, how nice was it to rebound from every bogey with birdies?
JEONGEUN6 LEE:  Actually I felt that I was going to actually have a big play today.  I thought that I was going to have a pretty good shot.  Of course, you know, when you play a game you sometime get bogies but I think I probably could have taken more advantage of birdie opportunity.  But, I guess I didn't as much.
Q. Still managed to finish in red numbers on a Sunday at a Major.  How does that feel?
JEONGEUN6 LEE:  Well, I guess I did fairly well, probably, you know, in par or better than I expected but if I actually think deeply about how I played per round basis maybe I could have done a little better so that's probably something that I need to look back and maybe when I come back again to the States and I like to show better result next time.
Q. That was my next question.  How often do you think you'll now want to come back to the U.S. now that you did this well here?
JEONGEUN6 LEE:  For now I think the rest of the year is going to be focusing on Korean Tour.  I don't know what's going to be next year is going to go like but for what I know, that this year is going to be in Korea and maybe who knows what my whole next year but that's my plan now.
Q. Last one for me, many South Koreans at the top of the leaderboard here this week.  How come?  Why do you think?
JEONGEUN6 LEE:  First of all, I think most of our Korean players, they have excellent swing and not only that, I think KLPGA, the settings have gotten a lot tougher, almost as restrict and tough as LPGA standard, if not the same.
So, the play back home, if they move there, feel them play over here there's not a whole lot of adjustment they have to make.  So I think that also contributes to how well they do here.
