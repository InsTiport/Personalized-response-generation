MARK NEWELL: Now to the champion.  Since 1895, the USGA has awarded a gold medal to all USGA champions.  With a score of 278, 6 under par, Korea's Jeongeun Lee6.  We're now thrilled to present this historic trophy as well as a $1 million winner's check.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  This championship has so much pressure.  Down the stretch, looked like you were totally unfazed by that pressure.  How much pressure did you feel on the 18th hole?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  I felt pretty nervous starting on the holes 16, 17, and 18, but I tried the best that I can.  I know I made two bogeys, but I just didn't want to think about it too much.  I tried the best that I can.   
 Q.  You did fantastic.  What aspect of your game were you most proud of today?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  So all my shots were pretty good so far.  Every time, if I make a bogey on the 1st hole, I kind of feel a little bit calm because I know that I will play well at the end.   
 Q.  How much does it mean to you to win the biggest championship in women's golf and $1 million?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  The route that you're playing golf for --   
JENNIFER KIM: (Crying) Sorry, I'm just really proud of her, how she played.   
She couldn't imagine coming this far, you know, winning the first LPGA tournament, also Major championship, and she feels proud of herself, and she worked so hard.   
 Q.  Please tell her that we are all proud of her.  
 Congratulations again to the 74th U.S. Women's Open Champion, Jeongeun Lee6.
