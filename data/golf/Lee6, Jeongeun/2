  Q. Did you feel any pressure this year being the defending champion?
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  I wasn't feeling pressure at all.  It's just that my swing wasn't really how I wanted this week and I just feel not really confident about my swing and just -- yeah, that's why I just feel not really happy about it.
 Q. Okay.  How did Cypress Creek play today versus round one?
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  There wasn't much of a difference comparing to first round and today's round.
 But it's just that today the weather was a little bit chilly and I guess that is why a lot of players were struggling playing today.
 Q. Lastly, there is a couple amateurs on the first page of the leaderboard.  Do you think as amateur can win the championship this year?
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  I feel like amateurs are going to feel a lot of pressure out there, especially the final round.  So I feel like there could be a chance to the professional players winning the tournament instead of the amateurs.
