 Q.  All three players in her group played well today.  Did they feed off of each other to play better?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  She said overall today, she had very good rhythm, but she feels a little off about the 5th hole.  She said she got good vibes off everyone and helped each other play a good round.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your position on the leaderboard?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  She's happy with where she is, especially for the second round.  Feels important for the third round so will be more concentrating on the game tomorrow.   
 Q.  Did she find anything today that she can use to maybe do a better score tomorrow?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  For tomorrow, I'll be concentrating on the par 5s and trying to score well on those holes.
