Q. Another solid U.S. Women's Open.  Great playing today.  Just despite the conditions, four birdies on the closing nine to finish things off.  How would you sum up your final round?
JEONGEUN LEE6:  I was a little bit nervous with my shots and I wasn't really satisfied with couple of my shots in the first nine holes.
But after, the back nine, I mean, I kind of focused on my shots and trying to do something differently.
So I think I did okay with that, but my goal was to make top 3; I'm okay with top 10 today, so...
Q. What do you take away as a player from a week like this when you had to come back on a Monday after a long wait yesterday?  As a player, what does a long week like this mean playing two tough golf courses?  Sum up the overall experience.
JEONGEUN LEE6:  Yeah, I mean, the past few weeks it's been really, really cold, and I'm sure a lot of other players out there were kind of struggling with this cold weather conditions.
But then I'm glad that I get to play in a U.S. Women's Open and played a couple other LPGA tours out there, because, I mean, a lot of tournaments have been canceled due to COVID, so I'm pretty happy with that.
