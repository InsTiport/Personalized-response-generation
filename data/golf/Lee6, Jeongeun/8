Q. Bogey-free 67 today. You have to be very proud of how you played today with the weather conditions. How do you feel right now?
JEONGEUN LEE6: Playing pretty well this week, today, but my shots and putting are pretty good. So I'm pretty satisfied and confident with my game today. Hopefully I will play well the rest of the three rounds.
Q. Was there any particular part of your game that you thought was very strong today, or was it just an overall good day for you on the golf course?
JEONGEUN LEE6: I think I just try my best as I can and I just finished pretty strong and so my shots and my putting were pretty good condition. I tried my best as I can with my putting, because the putting green was pretty wet and kind of slow. But I played my best. I'm pretty staffed with it.
Q. You've wrapped up the Rookie of the Year, and now you're back playing in Korea in front of Korean fans. This has to be a very special week for you. What was the experience like playing for the Korean fans today?
JEONGEUN LEE6: A lot of my fans came to watch me and supporting me, so I feel more confident. It just makes me feel more happy to be back, and then just seeing all my fans just cheering for me, yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.
Q. Any long putts, anything special, or was it just a steady day for you?
JEONGEUN LEE6: Especially on hole 10, I putted pretty hard, so it ended up going in. But if I didn't really attack the pin perfectly, then I would have made a bogey on that hole.
But yeah, I was pretty happy with that shot.
Q. How long was that putt?
JEONGEUN LEE6: Nine meters.
