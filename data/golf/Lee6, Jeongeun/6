 Q.  A fantastic nice last night really propelled you in a great day today. How are you feeling after round 2?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6: You know, actually a lot of people this morning were cheering and then they were congratulating me and then they saw that, oh, she did really well with the speech and I felt really good about it and I felt like really good feelings about today, so my shots and my putting were good so far, but I kind of want to try my best I can for the last two rounds.   
 Q.  Was there anything you improved on today from yesterday?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6: Yeah, yesterday I could have shot a 3-under, but I know I made a couple -- I missed putts on a couple of holes yesterday, but today I think I improved my putting and my shots, so that's why I think I played pretty well.   
 Q.  Yesterday did you put a little bit of pressure on yourself for your speech, and do you feel a little bit more free now that the awards are over?  
 JEONGEUN LEE6: I was really a bit nervous about it, but I've been practicing with my speech for a couple months, and so that's why I feel a little bit more confident giving a speech to everyone. Yeah, so everyone was pretty satisfied, and they were cheering for me how I did my speech pretty well. But yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.
