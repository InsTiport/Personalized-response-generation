  Q. Great playing today.  Two under par on Jackrabbit to get yourself back into the championship.  How would you sum up round two?
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  So the first nine holes I was a little bit nervous because of my swing was kind of a little bit shaky.  After the rest of the nine holes I made a couple birdies, so I was pretty confident with that.
 Yeah, Jackrabbit course, especially the total yardage is shorter than Cypress course, so it's much easier for me to hit some of my short wedges, and then it was easier to make birdies.
 Q. You birdied three on your back nine, 3-under par on that closing loop.  What does that do your for your confidence heading into the weekend?
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  Like I said, I was really confident making birdies on the back nine, so I feel a little bit more confident.
 So I think I'm going to play well the rest of the rounds, and so I'm just going to focus on hitting well on my tee shots.  And so, yeah.
 Q. Two more rounds left at Cypress.  What does that mean, to be able to focus your attention on one golf course versus two completely different golf courses?
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  Comparing to like the other courses and playing -- practicing on the two different golf courses, I think this is really fun.  I heard that this is the first time that U.S. Women's Open posted the two courses event, so it's really fun out there.  I really like it so far.
 Q. Lastly, you're well within contention for a major championship, the U.S. Women's Open.  What would it mean to play well this weekend and ultimately come away with a win on Sunday?
 JEONGEUN LEE6:  So I'm just going to play my best as I can the rest of the two rounds.  So I'm just going to focus on my short game and then playing consistently on my tee shots.  So, yeah, hopefully I will play well this weekend.
