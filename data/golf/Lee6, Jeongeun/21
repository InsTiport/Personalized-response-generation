Q. What were the conditions like out there today?  It looked like a really tough day.
JEONGEUN LEE 6:  I mean, I think I did pretty good before and after.  But yeah, I made a couple bogeys, and I know it was kind of a little bit rough, and my rhythm was kind of a little bit off.  But yeah, I'm satisfied with it.
Q. Are you happy with the way you played following up a win at the U.S. Open?
JEONGEUN LEE 6:  Yeah, so I mean, winning the U.S. Open, I mean, it's one of the biggest tournaments to win, and so yeah, I'm pretty satisfied with it.  But yeah, this week I'm playing the ShopRite tournament, and it's amazing, and I'm pretty satisfied with finishing in second place.
Q. How confident are you in your game right now, especially with another major just two weeks away?
JEONGEUN LEE 6:  Yeah, I mean, all my shots are pretty good, my short game is pretty good and consistent.  For the KPMG I just have to focus on my condition, make sure to be stable and be good.
