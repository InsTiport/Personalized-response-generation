  Q. What was it like watching somebody shoot 60?
 BRET BAIER:   It was absolutely amazing.  What we were trying to do is stay out of the way.  Towards the end we were nervous, so we tried to get out of the way as much as we could.
 She was fantastic, and I think she could have shot 59 really easy.
 Q. At what point do you stop looking at your game and start watching her and just saying, This is fantastic, something different?
 BRET BAIER:   I think she was 9-under on the back nine.  So after about four of those you're like, wait a second.  What's happening here?
 And then we were really looking at the game.  We just took a picture of all of us with the card.  It was her best round ever, and it was really fun to watch.
