 Q.  Four birdies in seven holes to finish has left you in a very nice position early on out here?  
MIKAEL LUNDBERG: I'm very pleased.  I haven't been putting good all year, which is normally my strength.  Today I finally got a few putts in.   
 Q.  What are the conditions like out there?  We've had quite a lot of rain over the last few days.  The greens little fairly responsive, but I think you just mentioned they are drying out a little bit now?  
MIKAEL LUNDBERG: Yeah, if we don't get anymore rain, I think it could be good for the weekend.  A little bit more work for the guys in the afternoon, but that's the way it is.   
 Q.  Two Top-10s very early in the season for you.  Has it been a little frustrating since then?  
MIKAEL LUNDBERG: More than a little.  Very much.  I played okay.  Normally my short game is normally my strength, hasn't been to where it should be.  Today it's come -- it was back where it should be.  Hopefully it's going to stay there now.   
 Q.  Just tell us about the atmosphere.  Sell out crowd here today, great crowds watching all the groups.  Have you enjoyed it?  
MIKAEL LUNDBERG: Yeah, very much.  It's fantastic out there.  The weather is good and the course is in really nice condition even though it's wet.  The crowd is great.
