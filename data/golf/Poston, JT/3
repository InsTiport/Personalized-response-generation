 Q.  Nice playing. Just kind of take me through your round there.  
JT POSTON: Yeah, hit it really good. Little sketchy off the tee at first, but got a lot out of the round. Short game has been really sharp; made some nice putts, and real good start to the week.   
 Q.  Delay throw you off at all or just kind of rolling with it?  
JT POSTON: I wouldn't say it threw me off, but I was on a nice little roll there when they blew the horn. I think I was 4-under on my last four holes. Would've been nice to keep it going, but came out this morning and first few shots were not my best, but made some pars.   
Kind of got the round going again.   
 Q.  Feel comfortable out here on this course?  
JT POSTON: Yeah, I do. I like the course a lot. I've played it every year when it was an opposite-field event. Happy that it's a full-field event now. Yeah, I love coming out here.
