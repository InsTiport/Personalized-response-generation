 Q.  Thoughts on the match?  
SCOTT ANDERSON: Yeah, no we had a great match.  I mean, both of us played actually really well; hit it solid.   
At the end of the day, his putter got hot and mine didn't; I just didn't make enough birdies.   
 Q.  So then you went to all square and took a 1-up lead through 11, 12, 13.  Talk about that run.  
SCOTT ANDERSON: Yeah, he had a couple -- he made bogey in a couple spots and then 13 I had a good --  or 12 I had a good shot and made birdie.   
Then 13 hit one in there close for par.  Tough hole.   
At that point we were in a good spot, but at the same point, give him credit.  He birdied 15 and so did I.   
On 16 I mishit a 7-iron, and that was kind of what spelled it for me at the end.   
 Q.  Then you had a great run last year and this year.  What do you take away from these experiences?  
SCOTT ANDERSON: I just think you know that you can come here and get it done against the best competition probably in the United States from a Mid Am level.  So gives you confidence moving forward.   
At the same time, I think I got a few things I need to work on to clean my game up, and then we'll see from there.
