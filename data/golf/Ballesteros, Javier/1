Q.   1‑under par today, how do you feel about that one?
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   Well, I played quite good today.   I think I started on the 10th tee, 10 through 18 are the easiest holes and I didn't play well those ones.   I bogeyed the 10th and 17, I think those two holes are easy holes to make birdies, so probably the cut is there on those two holes and on the back nine. 

Q.   You're here representing your father, it's the 25th anniversary of the OMEGA Dubai Desert Classic, and obviously all the tournament winners are here except for your dad.   How special was Tuesday when you played in the Champions Challenge?
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   It was very difficult.   I was a bit nervous on the first tee and it was nice to play with OlazÃ¡bal and JimÃ©nez, two good friends of my dad.   Yeah, it was very special and I hope my dad was proud of me.

Q.   Many players would have played with your father, some wouldn't have done; how many did you know?   Did you meet Tiger and Rory for the first time?
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   I didn't have a chance to met them but I've seen them many times on TV and watched them hit some balls on the driving range to learn something. 

Q.   What about your own ambitions in the game, are you following in your father's footsteps?   Is professional golf going to be your life?
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   Well, I don't know when, maybe next year, something like that, but yeah, I will definitely want to make golf my way of life.
