 Q.   How was that?   
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   It was good.   I really enjoyed.   
   
 Q.   Standing on the first tee, mentioning your father‑‑  
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   Yeah, I think it's an honour.   
   
 Q.   Is there any emotional attachment when you play, and marking the anniversary?   
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   It's an honour to play here for my dad, and I will really try to do my best and make him proud.   
   
 Q.   You had a fantastic up‑and‑down at the first, great chip, and a birdie at the third, which is the sort of thing we expected from your father.   
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   Yeah, the first one I hit a really bad drive to the left.   Nice to put it on the fairway and had a good up‑and‑down.   On the fairway I hit a really bad drive, managed to hit it to the right and a good 6‑iron.   It was good to make four.   
   
 Q.   Did JosÃ© Maria, when you were driving it into the distance the wrong way, was JosÃ© Maria supportive?   Was he saying that was just like your father?   
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   Yeah, it was kind of‑‑ usually I don't drive the ball bad but I mean, you know, it's difficult sometimes to get away with it.   I hit some good putts that didn't go in.   
It's a long course and difficult in the rough as I did sometimes; it harder.   I don't know how many fairways I hit today but I would say 13 fairways, so it was quite a good score.   
   
 Q.   Your studies at university‑‑  
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   Yeah, sometimes I can only play for two hours, some days six, not as much as I would like to, but that's fine.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel pressure on your golf because everyone expects things and looks at you because of your father?   
JAVIER BALLESTEROS:   Not really.   I think what my dad did was fantastic, and I just try to be myself and play golf.   Missing a few drivers on the first few, it's normal, nothing really very strange, I don't feel pressure.   Just try to be myself.
