  Q. You'd be very proud of me. Last night I didn't go to your spot, but I went to their cousin, Peiwei.   
 BRINY BAIRD: There you go.   
  
  Q. You shot 4-under today, nice little 67 out there, so all is good.   
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah, I have a deal with myself, anytime I shoot in the 60s I go from Peiwei to P.F. Chang's, so I'm good. I'm like you, I went to Peiwei, and now I think I'm going to upgrade to P.F. Chang's tonight. As long as I keep it in the family there's no trading around. I can go between the two.   
  
  Q. Tell me about this golf course out there today.   
 BRINY BAIRD: It's playing tough, it really is. There wasn't a lot of wind, but it swirled a couple times, and the greens are unbelievably firm. You know, when you're coming in there with a mid-iron it's hard to get the ball close. The rough is thick. I'm very, very pleased to walk away with a 67, I can tell you that.  
  
  Q. I heard earlier in the morning that it was tough in the beginning for guys to make that adjustment for that first big hop because no one expected the greens to be quite as firm as they are.   
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah, I think they firmed up quite a bit. Several of us didn't get a chance to play in the pro-am yesterday, but we played on Tuesday, and they got even firmer. They're rolling pretty quick, so you definitely didn't want to short-side yourself if you happened to miss a green.  
  
  Q. The rumor is that they tightened the fairways just a little bit, too. The rough is not terrible, but if you get in it, it's not easy to be in there.   
 BRINY BAIRD: I don't think that's a rumor, that's a fact. They've pinched fairways in. They said they did it four years ago, and I'm going to call them on that (laughter). The rough is definitely up from years past, so they're trying to toughen it up. If that's what they wanted, then success.
