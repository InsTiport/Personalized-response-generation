 Q. Exciting finish. That was a good putt to save par.
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah, it was. You hate to end on a sour note. That doesn't make in this case, not dinner, but lunch taste quite as good. So it's nice to make a 20-footer. I didn't do all that good on the last hole, but still, to make a 20-footer, it'll make lunch taste better.

 Q. And the putter worked well today. Tell us about the putter and the grip that you have on that putter.
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah. It's just kind of what feels comfortable. It's like a cross between -- I guess it's a claw, kind of what DiMarco does in some aspect, and it just feels comfortable. So I'm going to keep putting with it until it doesn't feel comfortable.

 Q. I was trying to explain. It's hard to explain. But maybe tomorrow I'll explain it more. Talk about your round. What was good for you?
 BRINY BAIRD: I did a lot of stuff good. I didn't do anything spectacular. The conditions out there weren't easy. Compared to last week, the ball is going really honestly nowhere. You know, if you normally hit an 8-iron 160 yards, it's going 145. There's a huge difference.
 So you know, I think we played smart today. When I say we, my caddy and I played very smart today and I hit the ball for the most part where I was looking.

 Q. When you play in these conditions, do you look at the scoreboard and say, wow, I'm playing really well on a tough day because nobody else is going that low?
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah. You know, a lot of times you don't have to look at the scoreboard. You can pretty much tell how the conditions are and how you're playing, and you can get a gauge. But every now and then a guy will skew that and shoot 7, 8, 9-under on a hard day. But I know I was playing well, and I still think someone can get away from here today in these conditions with lower rounds.
