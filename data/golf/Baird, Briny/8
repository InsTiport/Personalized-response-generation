 Q. Nice playing out there, 5-under par this afternoon. Just some thoughts about your round. 
 BRINY BAIRD: I made some bombs, I really did. I made some three putts that were probably over 25 feet and holed out a 90- to 100-yard shot. 
 You take a couple of those away, and it's solid 1-under round as opposed to a 5-under round.
 Obviously I played well to shoot what I shot. I'm not taking anything away from it. But I think it took a couple putts like that, and maybe even something crazy like a hole-out, to shoot 5-under in the afternoon. It played really difficult.

 Q. I was going to say, from this morning the wind really picked up this afternoon?
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah, the strength of the wind wasn't as bad as the direction of the wind. The direction, it would be complete opposite directions from hole to hole, so that made it tough.

 Q. Talk a little bit about your season up to this point?
 BRINY BAIRD: There's not much to tell. We could do that in three seconds: not very good. (Laughter.) 

 Q. What could that week do for you then?
 BRINY BAIRD: Oh, well, it's obvious what it would do for me. It would keep me playing out here as opposed to not playing out here. 
 Pretty much about the only way to sum it up. It's that simple.
