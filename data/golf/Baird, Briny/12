  Q. Nice par there.   
 BRINY BAIRD: For sure. Got out of position a bit, but to answer your question, it's always nice to make a nice putt on the last hole.   
  
  Q. Your score of 2-under, how do you feel about that? Thinking about where the leaders will be at the end of the day?   
 BRINY BAIRD: Hard to say, with some just having tee'd off. I think 2-under is a good score.   
 The golf course is playing fast and firm, the rough is not long, but you're catching crazy flyers. 2-under is a good score.   
  
  Q. You have to feel good about how you're playing?   
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Talk about the strong points of your round today.   
 BRINY BAIRD: I know it sounds strange to say, but if you know the ball is going in a certain direction, it's easy to lineup and hit shots. There on the last hole I made a 15-footer to save par and made a couple of other putts like that to keep momentum going, and that was probably -- more than anything it was probably making some putts today.   
  
  Q. What were the conditions like this morning earlier when you tee'd off compared to now and what the afternoon is going to face?   
 BRINY BAIRD: Changed a little bit, it was a little more breezier this morning than it is right now, so I think they might have been a little more difficult this morning than they were this afternoon, but not by a lot.
