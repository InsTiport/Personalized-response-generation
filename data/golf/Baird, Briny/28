 Q.  Talk about the round. 
 BRINY BAIRD:  So far, so good.  I hit it good and made some putts.  Hit a couple of loose shots that weren't quite perfect.  They could have found the rough, but they turned out fine on the fairways.  Added up to 7 under pretty quick. 

 Q.  Talk about having a chance to win near your home. 
 BRINY BAIRD:  I think it is my home.  I will definitely be a member here.  It's 4.1 miles from the clubhouse to my house.  I've been here all five nights. 
 It's awesome any time you have a chance to play well at home.  I played well a couple years ago at Disney.  That kind of felt like home. 

 Q.  Are you ready to win? 
 BRINY BAIRD:  It stops becoming a physical game at a point, and it becomes a mental game.  You have to control your nerves not on Thursday morning, but it's Sunday afternoon that you have to be mentally tough. 

 Q.  Was it a slow round? 
 BRINY BAIRD:  It was fine for me because I was playing well.  Pace of play isn't an issue if you're playing well. 

 Q.  What do you have to do to win? 
 BRINY BAIRD:  Beat everybody else in the field.  Get off to a good start or have a flurry at the end.  Hard to really tell what guys are going to do, what they are going to do in the morning.  Somebody might get it to 18, 19, 20.  I still have three holes left.
