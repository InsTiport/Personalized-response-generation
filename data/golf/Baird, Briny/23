 Q. Talk about your day and your week so far. 
 BRINY BAIRD: Good, just not great, flirting with putting myself in a really, really good position and just kind of hanging just on the outside looking in. Not too far back. There's not going to be enough guys between myself and the leader to stay too far back for sure. I think anything from probably even par to obviously where the leader is at is going to have a chance tomorrow. But it's going to take a heck of a round. It's going to take a 5-under type round.

 Q. As far as this week is concerned, you've had some pretty strong winds and some high gusts. Typically this has been a golf course where you can shoot some really good numbers but also make some big mistakes and some big numbers. The wind is kind of taking a really good round out of it probably?
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah, that's why Bernhard's round yesterday was so unbelievable. It doesn't matter who shot that. It was amazing. Yeah, the wind, I think, is the story of the week so far. The wind does everything; it plays with your golf ball. And it's been a swirly wind. That's why so many guys are hitting water on 17 and other holes, coming up short and long.
 I think right now if you summed up the tournament in three rounds, you'd say the wind is the culprit. It's drying out the golf course like you wouldn't believe. The grounds are rolling really fast.
