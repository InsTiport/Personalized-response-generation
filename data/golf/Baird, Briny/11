  Q. Nice playing out there. Not much going on the front nine, but then you turned it on the the back. Comments.   
 BRINY BAIRD: The back was actually my front, so I actually got off to a really good start: birdied five of the first seven. Made some putts, hit some good shots, and then I think it finally caught up with me.   
 I wasn't playing or scoring particularly well, so to get in with 5-under, I was pleased.   
  
  Q. Talk about the conditions out there. Just no wind whatsoever out there today.   
 BRINY BAIRD: None, hence the delay with the fog. Took forever for the fog to get out of here. Hate to say it played relatively easy out there. It was enjoyable round of golf. Not too much to worry about.  
 You get a golf course like this with benign conditions like that, there's gonna be some low scores.  
  
  Q. Comment on the new tournament here and the great crowds out there watching.  
 BRINY BAIRD: Surprised. I mean, not surprised that the resort is nice; everybody told me how great the resort was.  
 I'm a little surprised with the amount of people out here. It's awesome. I think it shows how hungry West Virginia was for a tournament.  
  
  Q. Right now you're two shots behind Boo. Talk a little bit about the weekend.   
 BRINY BAIRD: Well, I think Boo is definitely gonna have a home-field advantage here. I think he fits in good.   
 Um, two back right now, I would not be surprised if I was three or four back at the end the day. In striking distance, that's all you can say.   
  
  Q. All right. Thanks, Briny.
