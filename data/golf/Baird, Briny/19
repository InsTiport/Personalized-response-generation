 Q. Seven birdies, no blemishes, you must feel pretty good about that. 
 BRINY BAIRD: Yeah, I was happy. Anytime you can make seven birdies without any bogeys, it's a good start.

 Q. You've never missed a cut here, and you're in next week anyway. Do you think all those things together combine to make you feel a bit more relaxed and just let the game flow?
 BRINY BAIRD: Possibly, but you know, just because you've never missed a cut somewhere doesn't mean you've played well. I just have happened to have played well enough to have made some cuts here. Obviously off to a 7-under start, I'm in good position, and hopefully three more days, three more 7-unders.

 Q. You're three behind Mike Weir. Could you have saved yourself three shots out there do you think? 
 BRINY BAIRD: Always, absolutely always. 

 Q. What is it about this course? It's not supposed to be this easy, is it?
 BRINY BAIRD: No, if I would have told me 7-under before I started today, I would have been like, I don't know, might be a little low. But the golf course is set up, it's firm, it's fast, but there was no wind, so I think we were able to get the ball a little closer.

 Q. You moved up to 27th last week first round in the standings. How exciting is this new system?
 BRINY BAIRD: It's hard to understand. I think guys were a little shocked last week with as much movement as there was. Now we're getting kind of used to it, and you understand where you can get your points and how to get your points and stuff. It is definitely exciting. It's a system that enables someone like myself to possibly contend for $10 million.
