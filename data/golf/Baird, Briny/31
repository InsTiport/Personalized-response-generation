Q.  Is 4-under about -- is that a good score on a day like today?
BRINY BAIRD:  It's always a good score, yeah.  I mean, the conditions are -- I know what you're getting at.  The conditions are as easy as they're ever going to be, it's soft, there's almost no wind.  The wind has picked up a touch but it's still only blowing 5 miles an hour.

4-under par is not a great score, but it's still a good score any time you shoot 4-under on this golf course.  The rough is thick, and if you don't drive it in play you're not going to make pars very often, so all in all, very happy.
Q.  Putting went well today?  24 putts?
BRINY BAIRD:  Putting was good today.  The stats can be a little misleading.  I know how I'm rolling it.  The stats look good, it's probably not rolling quite as good as the stats look.  I had a lot of close birdie putts, and I had a lot of missed greens and had an easy up-and-down.  But definitely pleased.
