Q. Just your thoughts about the day.
KELSEY CHUGG: I don't even have words right now.  I mean, it was just -- the match against Marissa was one of the most exciting matches I've ever played in.  We were just neck and neck going back and forth making birdies.
I'm just so thrilled that this is the outcome obviously, but I'm excited to be playing tomorrow.
Q. You led all day.  She came back a little bit at the end.  Did you feel like this was your match to lose?
KELSEY CHUGG: I did coming down the stretch because she started putting the pressure on.  I made birdie on 15.
Q. And 14.
KELSEY CHUGG: 14,15, I think those were the two.  I went 3-up on 14 and then we both birdied 15 and then she birdied 16 and I was like, Oh, No.  Like she had some momentum going.
Q. How long were those last two birdie putts?
KELSEY CHUGG: The one on...
Q. 14.
KELSEY CHUGG: 14 was about ten feet.  Then the one on 15 was about 20, 25 feet.  Yeah, it was a good putt.
Then 16 I had like maybe like a 20-footer and just burned the left edge.  Yeah, and she had made hers.
Q. Any holes stand out?
KELSEY CHUGG: I think 9 was my momentum changer.
Q. Tell me about it.
KELSEY CHUGG: I hit it in the fairway and was going to lay up with 4-iron, have a good yardage in, and I blocked it right over into the trees.  That hole location is pretty tucked over there today.  Had like 90 yards in and I flew the bunker and rolled out to maybe like 30 feet and I rolled that putt in.
Q. How long was that putt?
KELSEY CHUGG: About 30 feet.
Q. Gosh.
KELSEY CHUGG: Yeah.  And then I birdied 9 ine and I turned around, hit a good drive and approach shot on 10 and birdied 10 as well.
Q. Maybe I should ask you what was the part of why you game that really stood out today?
KELSEY CHUGG: I hit my irons really well and then my putter just saved me.  Like finally made some putts, which was awesome.  I'd just been kind of making pars.
Q. What does this mean to you to be in the championship of the U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur Championships.
KELSEY CHUGG: It's incredible.  No words.  I'm just so excited.
Q. What do you think they're thinking at the Utah Golf Association?
KELSEY CHUGG: I think they're pretty excited.  They keep texting and calling me.  They're like, Go get 'em.  Go get 'em.
Q. You tell them to leave you alone.  You got some things to do.
KELSEY CHUGG: Yeah.
