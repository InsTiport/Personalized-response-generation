Q.  Well, we'll start with Shaun because that was something that I don't think many people had predicted today.
SHAUN MICHEEL:  Well, thank you.  It was really a tough day.  You know, both of us kind of struggled keeping the ball close to the hole and really think the pins were set in some pretty good spots and really forced you to fire back at the pins.  He had several balls that were just great shots that came back the distance.  I don't think either one of us really putted well.  He had a couple of chances that almost went in.  I played okay.  I didn't putt as well as I would have liked, but, you know, certainly wasn't expecting it.  I was just out trying to have a good time.
Q.  Very tough for you, but one has to say, what a bonus for Shaun.
SHAUN MICHEEL:  Well, any time you have an opportunity to play Tiger Woods head to head, you know, he beats most of us more times than we get a chance to beat him.  Obviously match play is just a little bit different of a game.  I think we had pretty decent scores, I didn't really add it up.

It was tough conditions out there.  Like I said, I finish second to him more times than he'll ever finish second to me.  It's just great to have an opportunity to play in the first round.  I know that he's been playing some great golf and will continue to do that.  Look, I needed some confidence to try to play head to head with the No. 1 player in the world and I know he didn't play his best.  Sometimes things just don't go your way.  If this was a four day event, things might be a little bit different.
