  Q. 5 under 67 today, I saw you grabbing your wrist. That birdie at 18 might have cost you a little bit?  
 SHAUN MICHEEL: Yeah, I hit it up against the lip of the bunker on 18. And in typical Pete Dye fashion, I didn't have much of a shot. And I hurt it. I hurt it pretty bad. My hand's numb right now. It's a little bit feels on the weak side.   
 You know, I'm pretty aggravated. I'm not a big fan of those types of bunkers and that's the reason why. But, anyway, I managed to hit a good shot. I played pretty well today. It was a very difficult day.   
 Club selection was a premium, and I think I was pretty good all day. Kept everything around the pins. I missed some birdie putts, but I finished off nicely. Any time you can finish 2-4 on this golf course, you have to feel good about it.  
  
  Q. After watching Jeff Overton chip in for his birdie on 17, was there a part of you that you thought I've got to make this now?   
 SHAUN MICHEEL: I don't no. He's beating me. And we're both Indiana graduates and he's beating me right now, so I've got some work to do.   
 But he played well. Actually, collectively as a group, we've got to have one of the best threesomes out there. I don't know where Jeff finished 8-7, and Nick was 4-5. So collectively we all fed off one another.   
 We all kept it pretty straight. Kept it on the greens, and we all made a few birdies and kind of fed off each other. That's always fun when you've got a threesome doing that.
