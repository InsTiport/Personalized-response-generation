Q.  Tough day?
SHAUN MICHEEL:  He played great. It's not great to be beaten but better to be beaten by someone who has played so well. I threw away a couple of shots early on but I did that yesterday and the day before and you can't do that. I don't know what happened. I felt good but it just wasn't meant to me. That's okay.

It's a lot of golf and I felt it was a pretty good week for me all round. I enjoyed coming here and playing in the HSBC World Match Play. It was kind of frustrating but he played some great iron shots at the end and my hat comes off to him. He played some great golf.

It's been a great week. It's disheartening when you make it this far and don't win. Maybe it's fatigue. I don't know. I feel fatigued but anytime I made a few putts he made them on top of me. I've had a nice week here.
