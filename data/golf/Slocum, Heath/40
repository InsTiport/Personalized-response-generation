  Q. Heath, welcome. Pretty good round today?   
 HEATH SLOCUM: Yeah, played real solid. I played real solid yesterday. Hitting the ball very, very well.   
 When you hit it solid in a lot of greens, you know, it's makes the golf course much easier.  
  
  Q. As an Atlanta resident, you know about as well as I do we need the rain here, but there was a lot of mud, including you got some on your ball there at 9. What was that like?   
 HEATH SLOCUM: Missed the fairway and had a little mud on it. I actually thought I was going to shoot the ball left with the wind and everything into the flag and sure enough it went dead straight. I got fortunate, the greens were at least soft and it stayed right there.   
 With the rain yesterday, like you said, we definitely need it here, but, you know, I just hope to continue the good play.   
  
  Q. I talked to Stewart Cink yesterday about playing in front of the hometown fans. It's not always what it's cracked up to be. What your thoughts with all the demands on your time here?  
 HEATH SLOCUM: Since I don't get to do that it often, it is fun. If you had to do it every week, it could be. But, you know, this week there weren't very many people out yesterday just because of the weather. But there were a few more people and they're definitely rooting you on so that's always good.   
 I know that hopefully the weekend will be nice weather, get lots of fans out, lots of people supporting and we'll have fun.  
  
  Q. You have been playing great golf lately. Good luck on the weekend.   
 HEATH SLOCUM: Thank you.
