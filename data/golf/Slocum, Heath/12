  Q. Talk about your round.   
 HEATH SLOCUM: Just a solid day. I drove it well, hit some good irons.   
 I tell you what, I think if I got my putter hot I could have had a really good day.   
 I made one, then kind of left a few out there. But for the most part it was a solid day. So it was a good start to the round.   
  
  Q. How does this set you up for the rest of the week?  
 HEATH SLOCUM: I'll be honest, it's still, it's a four round tournament. So what you're trying to do is not lose the golf tournament today. And I played well, I'll probably build on that a little bit tomorrow and the same going into the weekend and you just try and get a little better each and every day. And hopefully, as the saying goes, be in the tournament going into Sunday on the back nine.   
  
  Q. Talk about the course conditions. How do you feel it's playing out there?  
 HEATH SLOCUM: Beautiful. It's hard to talk about Augusta like being in even better shape, but as of Thursday, coming in, it's fantastic.   
 It's always in great shape, it's always going to get kind of better, but it's in great playable shape. The greens are fantastic right now.  
  
  Q. Pin placements?  
 HEATH SLOCUM: No, they had some good ones. They had a couple tough ones and a couple new ones, but for the most part they were, if you hit a good shot you could actually get to it. The greens are firm, but not quite weekend conditions.  
  
  Q. We're not expecting any rain so?  
 HEATH SLOCUM: Correct. They will have full control of how much moisture they want to put on them, so their target score, they will dictate what they want, so.
