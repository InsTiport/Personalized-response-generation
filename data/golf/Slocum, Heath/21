   HEATH SLOCUM: Obviously, I played very well. Took care of some scoring opportunities earlier. I think the course was as playable and scorable as I've seen maybe ever. 
 And for me, I took care of the par-5s, which was very key. And made some putts. So the shorter holes, I made some good wedge shots. Made some birdies and minimized the mistakes, a couple bogies, but good, solid start.

 Q. How about for the rest of the day? Obviously, early tomorrow you're going on to take the rest of the day to relax and sit on the 5-under or are you going to go out and work on some stuff? 
 HEATH SLOCUM: I'm done today. I'm going to take the rest of the afternoon and just relax. Try to catch up on a little sleep maybe and come out firing tomorrow.

 Q. It's notorious for having winds blow in the afternoon around here. Is it important for you to get a nice low score playing the morning rounds today versus coming back in the afternoon tomorrow? 
 HEATH SLOCUM: Yeah, you always anticipate the wind blowing in the afternoons here. So, yeah, if you get your morning round you definitely want to take advantage of it. We had minimal wind today this morning, so it was nice to take advantage of this round. 
 I don't know if it's going to blow real hard today, but yeah, it was nice.

 Q. I guess you have to always prepare that way though?
 HEATH SLOCUM: Yes, you do. And that's what I did. Like I said, I just felt like I played a really solid round today, and yeah, I'll always take that around this golf course.
