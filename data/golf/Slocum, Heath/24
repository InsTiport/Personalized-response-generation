   HEATH SLOCUM: I bogeyed my 15th hole, No. 8, and I ended up making a 15-footer on my last for par, but other than that, I really did.   
 I played good golf. Made a few par shots on my Back 9 and made a couple putts. So all in all I was happy. I was cold, but I was happy.   
  
  Q. Just talk about your year a little bit. Obviously the big win at the Barclays.   
 HEATH SLOCUM: It was a slow year. (Indiscernible). Started playing some better golf and winning Barclays just helped my confidence obviously.
