 Q.  4-under today, 11-under for the tournament, kind of put yourself in position to make a run tomorrow.  How are you feeling about your play? 
 HEATH SLOCUM:  I actually hit it better today than I have the first couple, still putting pretty good.  Just getting a lot out of my round, so yeah, it felt good to shoot another good round, kind of get closer to the lead or just get closer to the hunt of the lead, so maybe something special tomorrow and can have a chance to win. 

 Q.  Have the conditions of the course kind of changed over the last couple days, a little bit warmer today, and is it kind of changing the way the course is playing? 
 HEATH SLOCUM:  It just makes -- I really like the warm weather, so yeah, the ball goes a little farther.  It's just easier for me just to swing.  But really, the conditions are pretty ripe for scoring, so that's why I think you're seeing some pretty good numbers. 

 Q.  How will you approach tomorrow going in? 
 HEATH SLOCUM:  Really the same way.  I think this golf course you really have to make birdies. 
 You have to kind of take care of the shorter holes and some of the par 5s, so really nothing changes, just try to go make as many birdies as you can and maybe hope that's enough.
