 Q. Your feeling of the 18th hole right now?
 HEATH SLOCUM: I'm due for a birdie tomorrow. I hit a good shot today and hit a good shot yesterday. Overall I played great. It's over and I'll prepare for tomorrow's round.

 Q. What is your feeling about being very close to the lead in a tournament where you've got 20 guys that have a good chance tomorrow?
 HEATH SLOCUM: There's going to be some fireworks tomorrow. I think it's great. I feel very comfortable and confident right now, so I like my chances going into tomorrow. 
 What I'm going to have to do tomorrow is play the best round tomorrow. If I do that, I have a chance to win this tournament.

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 HEATH SLOCUM: They're different. I hit two quality golf shots, just had two poor bunker shots and a poor putt. Overall I'll take that. I played great today and I'll take that mentality into tomorrow. It's one hole, it just happened to be the last, and it happened to be two days in a row. Basically just due for a birdie tomorrow.
