 Q.   Obviously a big week, bubble week as they say.   128 going into the week.   How much does that weigh on your mind as you're kind of gearing up for the week?  
HEATH SLOCUM:   I mean it's there so you can't avoid it.   It's kind of like -- I mean I'm trying to play well this week regardless.   So I figure if I play well then it will take care of itself.   Yeah, it's there.   It's not going away.   I know what I have to do and so I just go out and play golf and, like I say, I play good golf and play the golf that I know I can play, I'll be fine.  
   
 Q.   How are you feeling heading into the week as far as your game goes?  
HEATH SLOCUM:   All right.   I'll tell you what, it's kind of been one of those years where I haven't gotten everything together.   I feel like I'm close but I'm going to have to have some things go my way.   Fickle golfers, in our head to get your own way, you kind of get in your own way.   It would be nice to have a couple putts go in.   Hopefully keeps the momentum going.   That's what I need, just a little bit of momentum.
