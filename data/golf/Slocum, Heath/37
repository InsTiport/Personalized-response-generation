  Q. With the wind today, 66 wasn't really ho-hum.   
 HEATH SLOCUM: I hit some good shots today. Hit a few squirrely ones but I putted well. I made some putts coming in. A couple for birdies, a couple for par. I was pleased with today's round.  
  
  Q. How much of an adjustment did you have to make because yesterday, 75 degrees, not a breath of wind and today a little windier and warmer?   
 HEATH SLOCUM: Not much of an adjustment. The golf course is still right there in front of you. We played in some pretty windy conditions this year, so this wasn't that bad.  
 I did air mail the last, just underestimating the wind, but overall, it was a good day, good round and I look forward for the weekend.  
  
  Q. And you made the par putt there at the last, two, so that always makes lunch taste all the more tastier?  
 HEATH SLOCUM: Yeah, anything going in makes it tastier.
