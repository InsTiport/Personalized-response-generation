WEIWEI ZHANG: The putter was really good today, just 23 putts. You know, the long game was not ideal and I just hit nine greens in regulation. The putter saved this round.
I hadnât had good finishes here for the two previous years. This year, I changed mindset into this week. I knew the wind would be strong again. I told myself that itâs OK to make a par for a tough hole.
I would play like this next two days. You shouldnât consider a birdie out there, and just need to play a safe game. Less pressure, better score.
