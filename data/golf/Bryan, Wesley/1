Q. Wesley, how would you assess your round out there today?
WESLEY BRYAN: I mean, it's getting a little bit better. I would say it was in spots a little bit sloppy today, but I was able to make a couple putts and make a few birdies out there. Don't feel like I capitalized in all the places I should have, but all in all, I'm pleased for sure after a couple rounds.
Q. After now six rounds back out here on the PGA TOUR, how does it feel? Is it kind of something you maybe took for granted a few years ago?
WESLEY BRYAN: Oh, yeah, for sure. It's one of those things you don't realize how much you miss it until you get back out here and the juices get flowing. Just made me realize how much I miss competing. It was fun, I guess, over the last couple years or year and a half to get to spend a lot of time with my family. Got to hang out basically for the first 18 months of my daughter's life. It was amazing, but definitely excited to be back out here.
Q. And the injury feels good?
WESLEY BRYAN: Yeah, it feels good. Still a lot of maintenance is required as far as stretching it out a little extra, loosening it up in the morning and then icing it down in the evenings, but all in all, I'd say it feels pretty good.
Q. Could you imagine your first two weeks back that you'd make both cuts and now kind of be in contention?
WESLEY BRYAN: Yeah, coming into it, I felt like I was playing really good. I still had a few more rehab starts left on the Korn Ferry TOUR but opted to not use those to come straight back out here because I felt like I was in pretty good form, and to be quite honest I felt a little bit disappointed after last week. Was playing great going into it and just didn't play as well as I'd hoped, but another crack at it this week, and hopefully we can keep it going on the weekend.
