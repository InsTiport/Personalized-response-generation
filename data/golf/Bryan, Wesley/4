WESLEY BRYAN: Well, obviously the conditions are really tough.  Starting with my snap into the water on No. 10, my first hole.   
I just tried to make as many birdies as possible and make up as much in the round as possible.  And didn't make the birdies and here we are.   
The crowds were great, so hats off to those guys.   
 Q.  Being in your home state, did you do anything exciting this week?  
WESLEY BRYAN: No, it's a work week for me.   
 Q.  What's your schedule going forward?  
WESLEY BRYAN: Going to do Valero then New Orleans and then we'll see from there.
