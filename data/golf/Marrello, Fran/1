  Q. Your thoughts on the event and what it was like playing in it your first time.   
 FRAN MARRELLO: Well, it was a good experience. I played in other Majors before, so I have done that.   
  
  Q. Sure.   
 FRAN MARRELLO: But it kind of turned out similar to the way -- you just get a little bit out of your realm, a little bit, I guess. And I just started bad and it kind of stayed that way.   
 I didn't play as badly as I scored today, but no matter where you play, you still have to putt the ball and it's pretty tough out there. So that was the most disappointing thing.   
 Otherwise, I got the ball off the tee reasonably well the last two days.  
  
  Q. Is there something you can take with you from this event or as you move forward in your career?  
 FRAN MARRELLO: Oh, yeah, everything's a learning experience, you're always trying to learn yourself, your game, and how you react under pressure and how much pressure you put on yourself. So I tried to stay within myself and not think about the result, just tried to play the golf course. But I didn't do a very good job of it, unfortunately.   
  
  Q. One of the other club pros mentioned that everyone out here is a good player, but not everyone plays in front of these crowds every weekend. I know you played in U.S. Opens, but is it, does that affect you a little?  
 FRAN MARRELLO: Maybe. It wasn't too bad, to be honest with you. Sometimes I get more in awe looking at some of these guys that you watch on TV all your life and think, well, geez, what am I doing here. So it was probably more that than anything. I tried not to do it, but I probably still did a little bit.
