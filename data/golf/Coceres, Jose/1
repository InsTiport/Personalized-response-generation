   STEWART MOORE:  José, great opening round, 66, started on the back nine, one birdie, eight pars, made the turn and came in with a blistering 32.  Maybe just go through your round for us a little bit.   
 JOSÉ COCERES:  Today my start is on hole 10 very early in the morning.  I play very early.  I start out by making par and birdie hole 15, very good shot on the third, had one putt.   
 Second birdie on hole 1, driver, wedge and putt maybe nine feet.   
 Hole 2, par 5, drive, 3-wood, chip in the bunker and one putt to one and a half, maybe six feet.   
 Another birdie on hole 7, 5-iron, maybe half a foot, good birdie, very easy.   
 Hole 8, drive, 3-iron, out to the right, one chip in the hole.  It's more better, no putt, very good.   
 On hole 9, I feel was my last hole for today.   
  
  Q.  Can you tell us a little bit about your exempt status?  And also, I know you had a run when you were in two playoffs, and can you tell us a little bit about that run and coming close to getting that full exempt status back this season?   
 JOSÉ COCERES:  Very happy for me for this year, I play very good for my golf.  I only play three times in the PGA, and I finish two times in playoff, and very good for my golf today.   
 Last year I played very good, no finish, maybe no winner and no Top 5, but I finish maybe five, six Top 10 last year.  It's not easy for me.   
 But for my golf, for this year it's changed.  Maybe my head, maybe I change my golf this year -- the last year and this year, it changed, and I play more my right, my head change more better, my family good, no problems, friends, good, no problems.  Very happy for stay here one more time.
