Q.  Birdied all the par 5s today?
JOSE COCERES: Yes.

Q.  That's got to be an advantage on this course I would think.
JOSE COCERES: Any hole making a birdie, but I think it was really important to make birdie on all the par 5s.  What happens is that I'm not a long hitter, but I'm sitting it pretty well, and I think this is a course where you have to hit very straight because the rough is very hard, very strong.  That's why it's very important to hit it straight in the fairways and obviously get it under par.

Q.  Somebody said this is the highest rough this year.
JOSE COCERES: Yes, the rough is really very hard.  Today I was lucky on the 12th hole that I made birdie from the rough because there were trees and leaves, and the rough was a little bit low under the tree where I was.  The rough where the sun is out and growing fully is very strong.
TODD BUDNICK:  We'll take some questions, guys. 
Q.  Do you have some good feelings about coming to Kingsmill?  Didn't you have a good tournament here last year?
JOSE COCERES: Yes.  Not only last year, but I'm playing well after last week or last tournament and in the American Express I played well.  I didn't score well but I played well, and I think that gave me the opportunity since I was playing well, now I can really concentrate on going low and scoring well.
TODD BUDNICK:  All right, thanks, Jose.
