TODD BUDNICK:  Talk about your round today.
JOSE COCERES:   Yeah, I'm very happy today.  I'm very happy with my start, I start very early this morning, 7:30.  I started on hole 10.  I played very good on hole 10.  I had a chance from two meters, hit it nine feet by the hole.  Very happy for the first nine, for the second round.  It's more difficult, the second nine for the start, only one bogey, one birdie on the whole nine, so very happy for my score.

It's not easy for me here because I need here the ball up, fly more up, and my golf is more     very difficult, very good point, and I come back to tomorrow, new day.
TODD BUDNICK:  You've taken some time to come back from the injury and played well, and you finished third at the John Deere last month.  Do you feel like it took you a long while to play well again?
JOSE COCERES:   Yeah, I played very good maybe four weeks before.  A big chance for the winner, I finish in the top, so very happy for my work.

Today I have very good feelings.  Now I'm very happy, I play last week, not cut, I 3 putt on the last hole.  So I was very happy today for my golf.
Q.  Your iron play was real good.  You hit close to the pins.
JOSE COCERES:   Yeah, irons I play very good.  My driver I play very good, hit fairways, very good, very good job on the second shots and very happy for the eagle on 17 for five points.  It's different from the normal.
Q.  How are the greens?
JOSE COCERES:   Yes, today I play very good greens, too many chances for birdies.  Only maybe too much water, it's hard to stop coming in, very good conditions in the fairways, on the tee, greens, very good.  Very good conditions for this week.  The people here are very happy, it's fun.
