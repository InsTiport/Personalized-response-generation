   CHRIS REIMER:  Welcome Jose Coceres.  Must be nice to be in a four-way playoff.  Just talk about your day a little bit.   
 JOSE COCERES:  Yes, very happy to stay here today.  It's a very good day for me, for the start, for 18 holes.   
 I birdied 1, 2, 3 and 5, one bogey on 6, but I'm very happy with my golf and last week, my golf and this week.   
  
  Q.  Just talk about being in a playoff two straight weeks.   
 JOSE COCERES:  Yes, very special for me.  This is my first time to be in a playoff twice in a row.   
  
  Q.  Did you see Boo Weekley miss the putt?   
 JOSE COCERES:  Yes.   
  
  Q.  On TV?   
 JOSE COCERES:  On TV.   
  
  Q.  What did you think?   
 JOSE COCERES:  Playoff.   
  
  Q.  Did you think you were -- that he was going to win and you were not going to get in the playoff?   
 JOSE COCERES:  The first putt was very difficult and it's very fast, the line is left-to-right.  But I was it was too short on the first putt and not lucky on the second putt, so playoff.   
  
  Q.  You won a tournament on a playoff on a Monday morning; does that help you at all?   
 JOSE COCERES:  Yes, but tomorrow is a different town.  Same day but different town and different Monday, different players.  Monday morning, my first time in the playoff, there was only one player, and now there's three more.   
  
  Q.  Did you guys know you were going to play just one hole when you teed off on 18?   
 JOSE COCERES:  I thought we were going to play four, but after I hit that putt, I thought it was over right then and there.   
  
  Q.  Was it dark; did the darkness affect you at all?   
 JOSE COCERES:  I'm old, I'm 43; I couldn't see.   
 CHRIS REIMER:  Thank you, good luck tomorrow.
