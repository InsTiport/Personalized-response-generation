   JOSE COCERES:  I'm happy with the state of my game, my scores have been very good.   
  
  Q.  What's your goal for tomorrow?   
 JOSE COCERES: The wind was much stronger today than in any of the past rounds, about a half a club longer.    
 I have to focus on the greens, that's where you score.  I'm happy with how I'm playing, if a Mexican doesn't win it might as well be an Argentinian.   
  
  Q.  Pin Positions?   
 JOSE COCERES: The hole dictates a lot of what you do, and they were noticeably harder today.   
  
  Q.  Your thoughts on the course?   
 JOSE COCERES: The course is beautiful, all the organizers and designers did a great job.   
  
  Q.  Historically, Mexican tournaments have been kind to Argentinians?   
 JOSE COCERES: I'd love to add my list of Paraguayan players to have won in Mexico.  I've got the good play in me, I just need to carry it over to tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  You're playing in the last group?   
 JOSE COCERES: I'm just going to focus on the course and not my opponent.  Everyone has to play the same course and winds so I'll just be focused on my own game.   
  
  Q.  Any advantage over Funk due to his back injury?   
 JOSE COCERES: Well probably not, I'm thinking his waist must hurt too from bending over so much to pick up those birdies he keeps pouring in.   
  
  Q.  Did you see this coming?   
 JOSE COCERES: I had good practice sessions in Argentina at my home course, I worked hard with the local caddies and they told me I was hitting them well, so luckily it carried over.   
  
  Q.  You seem to work well with your caddy?   
 JOSE COCERES:  Is he a friend of yours? No, just kidding.  He helps me out not only with the golf but with the language.  He does all the work picking the right club and yardage so all I have to do is focus on making a good swing?
