 Q.  How do you feel this week?  Is it a significant difference?  Do you feel nerves or excitement because it's a major championship?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Because I've been here in America for three weeks already, there's not much change, because I was playing previous tournaments.  I was just only focusing on my game.   
 Q.  What is it you like about this place in particular?  You played well here last year, too.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: This is my second time here, but usually this course is always good.  If I just play the way I play, then I think the score will come out very well.
