 Q.  How did it feel coming out and finishing the round this morning?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Because it was such an early round, I was a little bit worried in the beginning, but I think towards the end of the round or towards the middle, I found the putting feel, so it was a pretty good round overall.   
 Q.  Do you prepare any differently knowing that you'll have to play more than 18 holes in one day?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: No, not at all.  I prepare the same.   
 Q.  What's the plan of attack going into the weekend?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: My plan of attack or my play is going to be the same for round 3 and 4 as it was for round 1 or 2, but I'm going to work a little bit more to find the feel of my putting and the feel of my swing the remaining two rounds.   
 Q.  Talk about how the course is set up for you this week.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: This course is a course that I played last year, as well, and so it's familiar, so that makes it a little bit more comfortable.   
 Q.  We've seen you in contention so much in the majors; what is it about playing this these bigger events that seems to bring out your best game?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm not so sure.  I think it has to do a lot with my condition being very good, especially for the last week or two I've been in really good condition overall.   
 Q.  You'll have a while to wait before you start your third round; what will you do to stay busy and try and keep some of this momentum going?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: You're right, there is going to be some time until my round 3, so instead of continuing to practice I'm going to rest a bit, and then right before my tee time, I'm going to do some practice.
