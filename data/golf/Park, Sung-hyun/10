 Q.  What was the yardage of the second shot?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: 220 meters.   
 Q.  Seems like you were in this tournament all along in the final round today.  Talk about your play in general and how you were feeling out there.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I was very calm in this tournament.  I was very focused and just playing the way that I always wanted to play, and I have no regret playing in this tournament.   
 Q.  When you saw Lydia start to stumble on the 8th and 9th hole, did you feel like that was your window to try to get on top?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I wasn't thinking about Lydia's score at the time, I was just focused on my own for the time being.   
 Q.  Do you feel proud to finish tied for third or disappointed not to be in the playoff?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I was a little disappointed just as other players, how they weren't able to win at all.  But I have no regrets that I wasn't able to play my best.
