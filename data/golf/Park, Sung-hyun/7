 Q.  Another good day.  In Gee played very well.  Was it nice to play alongside of her since you're both playing decently well?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I played pretty well, but I didn't do not too bad.  I have a pretty good feeling about today.   
 Q.  Going into tomorrow, good feeling?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I expect tomorrow to be exciting.  I'll stay the course and hope to have a good result.   
 Q.  Do you like to chase on Sunday, or do you like to hold the lead?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Even though I am not in front, I feel good.  I'm not too bad following, even getting close.   
 Q.  So how many wins have you had coming from behind?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Last two tournaments.  The last one I was behind four strokes, but I caught her.   
 Q.  So last time you were behind four, came back and won?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  How long have you and In Gee known each other, a long time?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I've been seeing her since like elementary school.   
 Q.  You guys have played a lot together on KLPGA?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yeah, a lot.   
 Q.  How many times if you remember?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: A lot.   
 Q.  Tomorrow will you have a number in your head going into it do you think?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm not sure, but I'm thinking about four or five --   
 Q.  Four or five shots down?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  Does it help that you shot 63 earlier this week, that you know you can go low?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: With how I feel about my shot, I have no problem.   
 Q.  What will you try to do to emulate that round of 63?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Just feel back to my good shot of the first day.   
 Q.  If you win tomorrow, will that be the highlight of your career so far?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: My first would be the win on KLPGA, and this would be like the second one.   
 Q.  What will be the key for tomorrow to win?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I have to stay with rhythm and tempo, and I just try to be myself and not think about anything.   
 Q.  Will you be nervous tomorrow at all on the first tee?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yes.
