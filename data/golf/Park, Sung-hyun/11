 Q.  Is plus 2 too much of a backing away from the lead for you to catch up tomorrow?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I feel that there are a lot of parts where I came a little short and I just want to get back going further.   
 Q.  Was it disappointing in the putting today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yes, that's what I'm saying.   
 Q.  What was the hardest?  Was it the putting?  Was it the conditions today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I am disappointed by the putting, but the difficult environment was the wind going on today.   
 Q.  You seem to be a very focused player.  Is it just good concentration?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I am always focused and today I felt even more focused.   
 Q.  Does any golf course in Korea compare to this golf course at all?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: There are some courses that are similar, but then the fairways are pretty hard to some of the courses in Korea.   
 Q.  How hard is it to focus right now, knowing that you are that close to the lead?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I have done my best today.  There's still one more round going on, and it's great that I had this experience to come out here to the U.S. Open.   
 Q.  Does it make you feel more comfortable playing with older competitors from Korea or does it make you more nervous playing with some of these people?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: A lot of the Korean golfers, especially those that are older, have made it a comfortable environment for me to play in.   
 Q.  So you would prefer to play with them tomorrow?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yeah.   
 Q.  No nerves?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I felt comfortable and I wasn't as nervous as I thought I would be.
