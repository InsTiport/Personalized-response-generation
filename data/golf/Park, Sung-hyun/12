SUNG HYUN PARK: When I hit the tee shot, I got more frustrated with the putter.  I concentrated more on the putting.   
 Q.  How long was the putt and downhill?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: About five yards.   
 Q.  How do you feel overall about your round and the way you played today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: The last 18-hole, the tee shot was in the back, other than that as I started the morning until the 17th tee shot was very good.  That's why I'm very lucky today.   
 Q.  How do you feel your game is coming along?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: This is the first time in a USGA tournament.  And coming to the tournament, I didn't even think about winning because this is the first time for me.  I would like more experience with the USGA, LPGA.  But I'm trying to enjoy this tournament.  That's why I am just more comfortable, don't even think about the winning, I just enjoy the play.  That's why it happened today.   
 Q.  How much easier is it to play when you don't have that pressure?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: As I talked about all year, I don't even think about the winning.  And each shot I feel more comfortable, more focused on the shot, that's why I keep going until the 17th hole.   
 Q.  How were the conditions today in the morning compared to yesterday in the afternoon?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It depends on the wind.  Yesterday afternoon, just the wind blows so hard.  And this morning it was very calm and easier to still play today.
