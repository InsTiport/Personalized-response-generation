 Q.  What was the key to your strong play again today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm kind of not that great now.   
 Q.  You're going into the weekend close to the lead again; how comfortable are you near the top of the leaderboard?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm not greedy to get the title, but I'm comfortable.   
 Q.  You won a bunch in Korea this year; how do you think that experience will help you this weekend?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I won five times and I've got a lot of people and experiences so that I can embrace the different environments.  That's why I played well.   
 Q.  Who's your caddie, and how long have you been with him?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Since last year.  It was LPGA Hana Classic.   
 Q.  And then all of this year?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: All of this year, right.   
 Q.  He wasn't at the U.S. Open, though; was there a reason you had a different caddie at U.S. Open compared to Evian and the rest of the year?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: He has kind of a language barrier, so that's why I bring the other caddie.  We can communicate pretty good.   
 Q.  What's the key going to be for the weekend?  What's the most important part of your game?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: The tee shots are a key factor, and then the weekend weather is kind of tricky, so I'm just going to stay the course, and that's about it.   
 Q.  How did you feel about the round today, better than yesterday, same, worse?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I didn't have my shots today like yesterday, but I'm kind of lucky, so it evens out a little bit.   
 Q.  So you don't think your shot was nearly as good as yesterday?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: That's right.   
 Q.  Tee shots, putting?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Second shots, iron shots.   
 Q.  Will you go work on that on the range?  Will you change anything?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: After eating, then yeah.   
 Q.  How happy are you to be in the lead group going into the weekend?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It's too early to feel great.  It's too early.  But yeah.   
 Q.  What do you like or not like about this golf course?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: There is no easy shot here.  Tee shots, putting, second shot, everything, so I've got a headache.   
 Q.  Do you like really challenging courses, or do you like more open, easier courses?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I like a difficult course like this.  I like a challenge.   
 Q.  What do you think of Shanshan?  Did you enjoy playing with her?  You've played with her twice now.  She's funny.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: She is very kind, and she's kind of fluent in Korean.  She makes me feel comfortable.   
 Q.  So you talk in Korean?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: A little bit.  She likes Korean food better.  You cannot say anything bad about her because she can understand.   
 Q.  Who likes Korean food?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Shanshan.   
 Q.  Do you have any hobbies apart from golf?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I don't have any hobbies, just golf.   
 Q.  Do you read?  Do you watch telly?  Do you go shopping?  How do you relax?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I watch movies, like to watch movies.   
 Q.  Do you play tennis?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: No.   
 Q.  Did you play any other sports growing up, just golf?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Golf, yeah.   
 Q.  How old were you when you started golf?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Nine years old.   
 Q.  Do your parents play?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: No, they don't play.   
 Q.  How did you get into golf?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: My parents encouraged me to play, but I got into it by myself.  My parents are not playing, but I just --   
 Q.  Do your parents care whether you practice or not?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I practice on my own.   
 Q.  Was there someone you watched on television that made you get into golf?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Se Ri Pak.  Yeah, she made me into golf when I'm young.  I was too young to watch actually, but I watched Se Ri Pak replays on television.   
 Q.  Do you know Se Ri in person?  Do you meet her in Korea?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Just to say hi.  We're not that close, but I admire her.  We played actually in the U.S. Open, not the same pairing.
