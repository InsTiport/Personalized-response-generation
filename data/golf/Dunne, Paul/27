PAUL DUNNE: ?I am happy with my ball-striking and overall it has been a great week. I would have taken four losses for myself if the team could win so the end result has been good.
Q. Final day singles can be quite stressful and of course coming down to your match was a big deal. What were your thoughts playing Maverick?
PAUL DUNNE: ?Maverick is a great player and a lovely guy. It was a good match from the start. It was a little scrappy in the middle but in the last three holes we hit some really good shots. It was a good match and I think a half was the right result. I just wish the two of us could have holed these putts from three on the last.?
Q. And the crowd support has been immense. Just your thoughts on the atmosphere this week?
PAUL DUNNE: ?Yes, you can?t beat the Irish. The support has been incredible. Coming from everyone in my home town club time and lots of people have come out to support us and locals as well. The crowd has definitely been our left hand this week and we owe them a lot of gratitude.?
