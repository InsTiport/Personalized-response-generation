Q. Your thoughts on today's round?
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, I felt today I played a lot better than I did yesterday.  Yesterday I only hit three fairways and I don't know, it was just kind of a day where I got the ball around; shot a good score.
Today I played much better.  It was more solid.  I hit a lot of good shots, a lot of good drives.  Gave myself some chances and then I had a few hiccups kind of halfway through the back nine but finished off nicely.
I'm pretty pleased.  I think the wind will pick up this afternoon and hopefully that score will stand in good stead.
Q. Wind is going to pick up.  Quite different conditions to yesterday.  How did you approach that today?
PAUL DUNNE: We didn't play too windy, really.  The wind kind of picked up through seven or eight holes but it was only one or two clubs, max.  I think it will pick up a bit more.  So just enough to think of it.
But if you miss the fairway, it makes things a lot tougher because it's hard to control your landing distances when the greens are so firm.  But yeah, it will be tricky, but the key is to hit the ball in the fairway because you get loads of flyers from the rough.
So if people do that, it's still scorable.
Q. You'd have taken this position going into the week ends at the start of the week?
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, similar to last week.  Hopefully I can have a better weekend this weekend.
