Q. Your first official European Tour event, a hole-in-one, a round of 64, finished at 12-under, how do you reflect on all that?
PAUL DUNNE: I played pretty solid today for the most part.  I wanted to keep the bogeys off the card, so a little bit disappointed with a 3-putt, only bogey of the day.  Apart from that, played really well and had a few putts I thought were going to go in but stayed short or grazed the edge.  Could have been a few shots better but overall decent week and hopefully I can get better going into next week.
Q. Chatting to Matthew Fitzpatrick after he played his first professional event, first thing he did was look at how much money he won.  Did you do that?
PAUL DUNNE: No, I just walked out of the scorer's position tent, so I don't even know what position I'm in.  I don't know how much money I won but I need to win a hell of a lot over the next few weeks to get my card.  So hopefully I can win as much as possible.  I'm not worried about the money.  It's not something that motivates me.  It's just a means to get a card.  The card is the main thing for me, so if I have to get it through these weeks or Tour School, hopefully I can get one by the end of the year by time will tell.
Q. Give us an idea of your schedule.
PAUL DUNNE: I'm playing in Woburn, next week, British Masters and Portuguese Masters the week after.  I haven't got into Hong Kong.  And November 6 is Stage 2 of Q-School, so that's kind of the next month for me.
