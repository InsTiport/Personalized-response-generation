PAUL DUNNE: Any chance I had to kind of get things back on the right track, I didn't take them.  Just one of those days, I got nothing going.  Kind of on the back foot from the start.  Yeah, just a bit of a struggle.  Try and regroup better tomorrow?   
 Q.  We saw the frustration after that disappointing start, understandable, because I presume you went into the day looking to put yourself into contention.  
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, not if you saw me warm up.  Yeah, I missed like two gimmies on the first two holes, which I haven't done -- I haven't missed two in a row of those in, I don't know how long.  That put me back.   
Got it back to lovely with a couple nice birdies on the par 5s.  And on the 8th, I hit a great 3-wood straight down the fairway.  335-yard run and ran through into the rough, got a terrible lie, had another bogey.  That kind of day; once I got things back on track it was another step backwards and chasing it again.  And then I was just at the edge of the green on the 11th and made double from nowhere.   
Yeah, disappointing, but do better tomorrow.   
 Q.  As an Irish player, do you feel extra pressure playing The Irish Open?  
PAUL DUNNE: Probably, yeah, a little bit.  But it's not a bad thing.  We have the crowds to cheer us up and bring us along when we're struggling a little bit.  I think a little bit more pressure means you want to do well in this one more than you want to do well in other tournaments.  I'd say that's what it is.  But it's another tournament I played and didn't get anything going.  Hopefully tomorrow I can shoot something in the mid 60s.
