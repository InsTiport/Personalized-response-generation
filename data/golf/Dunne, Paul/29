 Q.  I know you are disappointed in the result but you really hung in there.  
PAUL DUNNE: We all played some great golf. A couple of putts near the end that we needed did not fall. We were disappointed we got off to a slow start and but we managed to get ourselves back into it.?   
 Q.  As much experience as you and Gary have together did you feel you could still manage to win?  
PAUL DUNNE: Gary and I are very comfortable. We both know we are going to hit great shots and we are going to hit bad shots. We don?t anything different about each other no matter how we play. We are good friends not matter what and that is a good relationship to have when you are playing foursomes. It frees you up to try to play great golf. We would have taken losing our match and winning the session and we are looking forward to this afternoon.
