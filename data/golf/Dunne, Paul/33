 Q.  Have you been back to Birmingham at all?  
PAUL DUNNE: No, I haven't.  I'm still on the amateur budget, so I can't just fly around the world wherever I want.  Yeah, I'll definitely go visit it if I turn pro, make some money and can afford the flights and stuff.  I have quite a busy schedule coming up until just before Christmas.  Hopefully I'll get back to visit, but for now, not in the books, no.   
 Q.  Talk about how you played today and the first two days.  You're through to match play and obviously that's the first goal.  
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, I just thought if I shot par or better today, I'd get through.  Greens are very soft after the rain last night, so yeah, to be honest, I played really mixed.  I played some really good golf in there and some terrible stuff, as well.  But for the first 14 holes anyway I managed to keep the bogeys off my card, which was pleasing, considering I hit a lot of bad shots.  I scrambled around and my short game was good.  A couple bogeys coming in, but it was nice to get the birdie on the last to secure it, I think.  I haven't seen the leaderboard.   
 Q.  So it's just survive and advance at this point?  
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, it was just get in comfortably without panicking too much.  It's not really -- I mean, it would be great to finish as high up the leaderboard as you can, but it doesn't matter at the end of the day.  Everyone starts from scratch tomorrow.  Yeah, looking forward to match play.
