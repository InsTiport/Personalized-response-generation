Q. Tell me about how the match went out there today.
PAUL DUNNE: We knew if we stayed patient and kept giving ourselves changes we?d put a bit of pressure on them. Both of us had a lot of good putts today that we kind of mis-read and shaved a lot of edges so it was nice to get a couple of good breaks toward the end. They hit a couple of loose shots toward that we managed to capitalise on so we are delighted to get the point for the team.
Q. Gary, did you feel there was a key moment in the match?
GARY HURLEY: Probably on 14, Scott (Harvey) missed a five-footer there, which was a tough putt and that gave us a bit of momentum coming in. We could hit the shots we wanted to hit. It was great to get the points for the team.
