 Q.  Decent round at Carnoustie today.  What went right for you?  It was looking pretty good for you on the back nine.  
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, once I got to the sixth, I struggled through the first five.  Got it around at even par, and from the sixth, I started to hit it well.  I started to play the golf I've been playing over the last couple of weeks and was pretty stress-free.   
I was hitting a lot of greens, getting the ball in play off the tee, giving myself a lot of chances.  I bogeyed 17, but it's playing tough.  It's a tough finish here.  So to play the last three in level par, I would have taken it on the 16th tee.   
My game is feeling good and hopefully I can make a few birdies at Kingsbarns tomorrow.  This is the first time I've broken par here, so pretty good.   
 Q.  Conditions you were decent today.  You must be glad to sort of get Carnoustie out of the way and move on to Kingsbarns.  
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, especially because the greens here are the firmest of the three.  They are the firmest and the quickest when it gets windy, that makes the course really tricky, so it's nice to get this on a calm day and be able to post a score.  On the other two courses, the score is right there even if the wind blows.   
So yeah, hopefully I can just continue playing the way I am and keep shooting 4- or 5-under.   
 Q.  Only two off the lead just now going into the final day.  Happy with that position?  
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, well, I've got tomorrow at Kingsbarns.  It's hard to know where you sit until everyone has played all three courses because everyone has a different test ahead of them tomorrow.  I'll just try to play as well as I can tomorrow and hopefully have a chance to win on Sunday.
