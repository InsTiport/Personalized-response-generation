 Q.  Paul, a 65 today, how was it?  
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, it was good.  I got off to a nice start.  Birdied three of the first four.  Got me off on the right foot and from there I played pretty solid.  I just didn't make many of my chances I gave on the back nine.   
Yeah, airmailed the green with a wedge on 12 for a bogey but apart from that I was giving myself chances most of the way around.  Missed a few of them.  Birdied 17 which is nice in the rain on the way in.  But all in all it was pretty easy, could have been a few lower but hopefully I'll save that for tomorrow.   
 Q.  How good is it bogeying the last going into the final round tomorrow?  
PAUL DUNNE: Yeah, it's okay.  17 is playing short.  They have got an easy pin with a backstop.  So I think half the field are going to birdie that today, so everyone knows it's a good chance.  If you're driving the ball well, you've got a lot of wedges in, so there's a lot of opportunities to make birdies coming in, but you've still got to do it.  Hopefully I can start tomorrow like I did today and just kind of build from there.   
 Q.  Is that the game plan, attack?  
PAUL DUNNE: I think the game plan is to stay dry.  I think the forecast tomorrow is not great but we'll see what it flows at us.  If the weather is good, there's lots of chances, and it's quite bunched, so to have a chance to win, you're going to have to shoot -- I think you have to be at least 15- or 16-under, so I have to shoot 4- or 5-under minimum.  To shoot that, you have to attack.
