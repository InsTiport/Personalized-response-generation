  Q. So talk a little about just the experience of playing the last two days?  
 SEAN DOUGHERTY: A lot of fun. Definitely disappointed not to make the cut. Played 72 holes. But a lot of fun. Good to kind of compare yourself against the best in the world. I'll take a lot of good away from it with a little bit of -- I'll take a lot of good away from it.  
  
  Q. How did the course play compared to other courses you've played in the past?   
 SEAN DOUGHERTY: It's probably the most difficult I've ever played. It was in great shape. Greens are super fast. Kind of what's to be expected from a major.   
 But it was definitely the most difficult I've ever played.  
  
  Q. Was there any one particular memory you'll take back home with you?   
 SEAN DOUGHERTY: Just my family was here, one of my best friends was on the bag with me. So those will be good memories to have for sure.
