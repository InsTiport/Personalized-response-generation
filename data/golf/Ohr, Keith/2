 Q. Keith, how would you compare Whistling Straits to the Pete Dye course at French Lick? 
 KEITH OHR: Very, very similar. I think it's a big advantage to be able to come from Pete Dye -- from French Lick and come here. A lot of similarities, tough off the tee. You've got to play some good shots. So I felt like we had a real advantage after playing that course a month ago or so. Just have to play good golf. 

 Q. Can you take us through your round, what you did well and things you might want to improve heading into tomorrow?
 KEITH OHR: In the practice round, I hit a ton of fairways and the course -- you know, when you're hitting greens and fairways, it doesn't seem hard, and I came out today and I didn't do it. If you hit it well, you can play it, and Pete Dye, he's a master of designing that. 

 Q. Can you talk about representing your section and The PGA of America in this championship? 
 KEITH OHR: It's so much fun, to represent Kentucky, the Kentucky section and PGA members across the country come up here -- you want to play so well and say, hey, look, we can play; we can do it. 
 I just didn't do it today, but I'm hoping, expecting to come out and play a good round tomorrow and show some people around the country that club professionals can play golf. 

 Q. First time in the PGA Championship, what are your impressions so far? 
 KEITH OHR: What an experience. My family is up here with me and just to take it in as a whole family and friends, it is special. What a treat it is. 

 Q. Now compare this atmosphere maybe to some other tournaments that you've played in?
 KEITH OHR: Doesn't compare. This is the pinnacle. This is it. It's spoiling; at the same time, it's humbling. But just to take it all in on a golf course like this, it's kind of hard to just try to play golf, it really is. What an experience.
