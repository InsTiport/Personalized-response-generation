 Q. How special is it to have your husband caddying for you this week?  
VICTORIA LOVELADY: Oh, it's so special. I'm very happy that he's able to be part of this experience with me. He's also able to stay at the village, so being a caddie is like the full experience for him, as well. You know, it's something that we've been looking forward for the past six years, and now we can celebrate it together, live it together, and he's been such an amazing support all these years, so I'm very happy that he's right by my side.
