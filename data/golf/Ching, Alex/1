 Q.  Talk to us a little bit about that birdie you made on 9. 
 ALEX CHING:  I was excited.  I came in.  I was honored to make a birdie.  I was 1-over and didn't really have anything going. 

 Q.  Really a gutsy par on the last. 
 ALEX CHING:  Yeah, the second shot kind of threw it all off. 

 Q.  Steve, it must have been great for you caddying for your son. 
 STEVE CHING:  It's an honor to be out here with my son.  It's a father's biggest dream to be out here caddying for his son.  He's the only -- I think he's the only player out here with a lawyer on the bag, so he'll get my bill at the end of the week. 

 Q.  Quite a thrill for a 17-year-old, 2-over, 72? 
 ALEX CHING:  Yeah, I just went out there.  It was fun inside the ropes with all these pros and just having everybody around.  It was an honor. 

 Q.  Tell me the truth; there had to be some butterflies on No. 1? 
 ALEX CHING:  Oh, definitely.  I was shaking to put the ball on the tee.  I was nervous but it was fun. 

 Q.  Three bogeys, one birdie.  Tell me about the birdie on 9. 
 ALEX CHING:  It was exciting.  I went into the hole 1-over and just hit an approach shot to maybe 40 feet past the hole and then just tried to two-putt it. 

 Q.  You're a high school senior, 17 years old, and you don't even play high school golf because it conflicts with the tennis season? 
 ALEX CHING:  That's true. 

 Q.  Better at tennis or golf? 
 ALEX CHING:  Well, I'm focusing on golf, so I chose golf since I was in the eighth grade, and that's what I want to do. 

 Q.  You had some luck back on the mainland at PGA National, too, I understand? 
 ALEX CHING:  Yeah, I did. 

 Q.  Tell us about that tournament. 
 ALEX CHING:  I just went out there, it was my fourth, fifth time at most, and I just wanted to have fun.  It was just a good tournament, good experience. 

 Q.  Any thoughts about college? 
 ALEX CHING:  I'm headed to University of San Diego to play with Tim Mickelson, so I'm excited for that.
