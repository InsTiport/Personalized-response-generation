 Q. How was the experience today? 
 LEE RINKER: It's good. I mean, the course is playing very nicely. It's playing tough but obviously there's a few good scores up there. I think it's very fair. There's nothing unfair about it. You've just got to hit the shots.

 Q. Has this experience this week differed from any of your other ones in any way? 
 LEE RINKER: Well, they are all a little different just depending on the golf course. But no, I think the PGA is very consistent in the way they set up their courses and all that. I think it's pretty similar. I mean, obviously the length is getting longer and longer over the years and stuff like that. But all in all it's pretty much the same.
