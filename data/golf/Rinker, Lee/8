  Q. Couple of birdies out there, do you want to talk about those holes?  
 LEE RINKER: Well, I made -- where were my birdies?   
  
  Q. 13 was one.   
 LEE RINKER: 13, I hit a 3-iron to about 15 feet and made the putt there. And then the other ones on the front nine, actually it was kind of funny, because Ryuji Imada made about a 25, 30-footer for birdie and I had about a 20-footer for birdie and Molinari had about a 25-footer for par. Ryuji makes his and then I make mine. I turned around and I said: I think mine was good, wasn't it?   
  
  Q. Talk about the week and your overall experience here.   
 LEE RINKER: For me, not really very good. I mean, I just didn't play very well. Obviously the tournament's good. Everything's good. I just didn't play very well. So I don't have any, just one of those weeks.
