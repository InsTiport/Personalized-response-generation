 Q. Just comment on your day, first of all. 
 LEE RINKER: Well, I had a lot of birdies and a lot of bogeys. Actually played pretty well. I just had a couple bad holes. 

 Q. What about your week as a whole?
 LEE RINKER: My week as a whole? Well I felt like I played okay, nothing -- the course is, it played very, very difficult. You had to drive the well, hit a lot of good long irons, you had to do everything really well. 
 And I think I did everything okay, nothing great, but I feel it was good to make the cut and play four days and get a little momentum going for the rest of the year.
