Q.  Pretty steady there, which is great for a first round here.
LEE RINKER:  Yeah, I played very well.  I probably could have shot 3  or 4 under.
Q.  Do you think the course plays for that?
LEE RINKER:  It's a hard golf course, but the greens aren't firm.  The greens are holding shots, and you've got four par 5s.  You know, it's definitely, if you're hitting the ball well, you can make some birdies out there.

I hit a great shot into 1 about six feet and three putted.  I just missed the first one and it was just a little short one, and somehow I missed it.

It felt good, though.  It felt good to hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.  I made a couple bogeys I probably shouldn't have.
Q.  Was it more the putting mistakes then on those holes?
LEE RINKER:  One was putting.  The last hole was right in the middle of the fairway with a 7 iron in my hand, and I hit it a little heavy into a bunker and it buried.  I should have hit the green.  We had one guy who hit it way left and we stood there for a while.
Q.  This is your sixth PGA Championship, correct?
LEE RINKER:  Yes, it is.
Q.  Do any nerves come into play or do you feel pretty comfortable because you have been here quite a few times?
LEE RINKER:  I have.  Obviously I'm not competing like I did.  You're maybe not as    as the round went on, I felt more and more calm and better and better, but it's still not easy when you're not out here week in and week out like the guys who are.
Q.  What's the game plan going into tomorrow?
LEE RINKER:  Just try and do the same thing I did today.  I felt pretty good about what I did today.  Just mainly try to do the same thing and hopefully maybe not make a couple of those mistakes that I made today.
