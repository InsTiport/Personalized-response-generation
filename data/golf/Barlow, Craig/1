 Q. I guess, just first off, what was it about the playing conditions that allowed you to go out and shoot so well this morning?
 CRAIG BARLOW: There wasn't much wind. Obviously soft conditions normally is good for scoring but it rained on us like 10 or 11 holes today.
 The course played a lot longer. It just -- the greens are soft, they're at a speed that you can make a lot of putts. I think they'll be some good scores. It was tough this morning in the sense that you were just -- I'm soaked right now so you were just trying to stay dry.

 Q. Do you know when it's raining on you, does your mentality make you want to play a little bit quicker?
 CRAIG BARLOW: We played in enough rain. No. It was the kind of rain that I don't mind playing in because it was just a steady drizzle the whole time. When you get the fast, fast downpours, then you got -- it kind of slows your rhythm down, you got to -- that's a little tougher. But it was just a drizzle all day so once you got wet, you just kind of -- you rode the wave.

 Q. Is Sedgefield, this is a course that sets up for your game well?
 CRAIG BARLOW: Yeah. I like the golf course. This is my first year here. So I played over at Forest Oaks a few times but it's a good golf course. Like I said, there will be some low scores this week. I'm happy with 4-under. With that being said, I have plenty of things to improve on.
