  Q. Being one of the youngest golfers here, you're towards the top of the leaderboard; how was it playing out there today and yesterday and to be up there?
 CATHERINE PARK:   It was pretty fun.  My round, actually the course was pretty hard during the practice round and my putting was a bit off yesterday, but I still played well.  And today my putting was better, so I was actually happy.  It was nice being out there.
 Q. What's kind of been your favorite part of the week so far?
 CATHERINE PARK:   Well, playing.  Yeah, I haven't played since January.
 Q. This is your first tournament since --
 CATHERINE PARK:   Yeah, it was really nice playing.
 Q. Has it felt different?  Obviously it's going to be a little different, but when you're out there has it felt different?
 CATHERINE PARK:   Yeah, I'll say the vibe since I'm playing with more older people than I usually play with, and a little bit more competitive.  I actually had really more fun.
 Q. How did you spend some of your quarantine or some of the time?
 CATHERINE PARK:   Just practiced every day in the garage.
 Q. Did you?
 CATHERINE PARK:   Yeah, just practicing and putting on the mats.  That's how I spent my quarantine, just studying.
 Q. Now to match play; does your mindset change, or any strategy, or is it just --
 CATHERINE PARK:   Just be more aggressive for match play since it's just -- it's either 1-down or 1-up, so I'm just trying to be -- since stroke play kind of goes by the stroke, but it's match play so I'm going to be more aggressive.  That's my mindset right now.
