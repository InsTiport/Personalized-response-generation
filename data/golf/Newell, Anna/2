Q. First of all, can you just tell me a little bit about your match?ANNA NEWELL: Well, it was a good match, got off to a good start, won the first hole, and I just kept it consistent, hit some greens and made a lot of good putts to halve the hole, and a couple good birdie putts, so that really made the difference out there.  I think my putting really helped me win the match.  If I wasn't rolling it good, it would have been a lot tougher match.Q. Did you feel like any part of your game was different today than it was the last two days?ANNA NEWELL: My ball-striking has been good all week.  The first round I struggled with putting, and yesterday was a little bit better, and then today was the best it's been all week.Q. Do you prefer match play or stroke play?ANNA NEWELL: It kind of depends.  On harder golf courses like this, I prefer match play because you're just playing the opponent.  In stroke play on a hard golf course, you're playing the hard golf course.  I like that setup.  But match play is fun every once in a while, but I like stroke play the best.Q. Are you going to change up your mindset at all for tomorrow?ANNA NEWELL: Not really.  I played pretty relaxed today.  Just going to go out there and have fun.  I'm really happy to be here and have the opportunity to play, so I'm just going to go out there and have fun and see what happens.
