Q. Strong finish.  Birdied four of the last six to post a great round on the South Course.  Obviously very pleased.
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, it was a good day.  I stayed present most of the time and just had fun out there, enjoyed the beautiful weather and beautiful scenery.
Q. Given what you achieved here last year you'd obviously like to go one step further.  How do you feel headed into the weekend?
J.B. HOLMES: I feel great.  My game feels good, so mentally I feel prepared.  So looking forward to hopefully getting more weather like this and just go out there and have a good time.
