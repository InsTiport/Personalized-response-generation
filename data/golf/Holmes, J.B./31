 Q.  It was kind of back and forth, and then you squared it on 17 with a great iron shot.  Talk about that shot you hit there to about, what, three feet?  
J.B. HOLMES: About two, feet, two and a half feet.  Yeah, I knew I had to hit a good shot.  Had a 5-iron against the wind and hit it perfect up in there close and was able to make a birdie.   
 Q.  Then 18 he hit a great chip to about a foot or so.  What was your thought process.  
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, I just didn't hit a good chip.  (Indiscernible) at the pin there and just hit a bad -- just didn't hit a good chip.   
It was frustrating, and then I misread the putt.  I gave it away earlier.  Back nine I was up a couple and he made a couple bogeys.  Some decisions I definitely would make a little differently.   
I feel like I beat myself today for sure.  I played well enough.  Played great all week.  It just seems down the last couple holes could have changed it for me.  Losing two and a half (indiscernible) frustrating, but hopefully the team will pick me up and still be able to finish here.
