  Q. Tough conditions out there this afternoon with the wind and everything, how would you assess how things went for you?
 J.B. HOLMES:   Great.  I mean, I really, I didn't miss an iron shot on the back side.  So it was playing very difficult, it wasn't a lot of room for error.  Ball struck it really good and putted well.  It was just, you know, played really good today.
 Q. Going into the round do you pay attention to your spot on the leaderboard on a Saturday or do you just stick with what your game is going and on the flip side of that when you see that you're having a good round do you take peeks to see what the rest of the competition is doing in conditions like these?
 J.B. HOLMES:   You mainly just try to focus on what you're doing.  There's enough score boards out there you're going to glance and get it every now and then.  But when the wind's this difficult, anything can happen.  You start trying to add all that stuff up you can make a double or triple out of here real quick.  Especially with the wind and some of these pins they have out here.
 Q. What's something you're hoping to improve upon for tomorrow and draw upon for the final round?
 J.B. HOLMES:   You know what, if I hit it just like I did today it would be great.  It would be nice if I made a few more putts.  But I really putted well, the ones we missed we hit where we thought, so we just misread them.  So there really wasn't anything I really struggled with today.  I hit everything pretty solid.  So it was just a really good day for me.
