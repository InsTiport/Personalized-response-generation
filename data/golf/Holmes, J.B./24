Q. How would you assess your week?
JB HOLMES: It was a great week for me.  Just tried to just enjoy myself out there and just thank God that I had the opportunity to even play out here and just focused on that.  It was a great week for me.
Q. Do you feel (Inaudible).
JB HOLMES: Kind of.  I felt like coming into today the best position I could possibly get was third.  Played well and ended up doing that way.  Yeah, those guys are playing a different golf course from everybody else.
Q. Talk about yesterday.  It's quite a transformation from the Scottish Open.
JB HOLMES: Yeah, thankfully I think I used all my bad luck up last week.  Yeah, not getting my clubs in till really late.  The first round I shot 80, so it was a frustrating week.  But it helped me get adjusted and I got a few rounds of links golf.  That was the purpose of coming over early, was to get adjusted to the time and get a few rounds in on some links golf courses.  I didn't achieve that the way I wanted to, but I did achieve that, so the goal was accomplished.
Q. (Inaudible).
JB HOLMES: It's different.  So, yeah, it was great this week.  If the weather wasn't quite so unpredictable, it would make it a little bit easier to like.  But, yeah, it's a unique test and it's a lot of fun when I get to come over here and try to do the best I can.
Q. There are some better PGAs to come just around the corner?
JB HOLMES: Yeah, it's always good to be playing well.  We got a week off and then another major.  So hopefully I can continue with a good play over to that.
