  Q. 66, always a nice way to end the tournament.   
 J.B. HOLMES: Sure, definitely a tough golf course this week, phenomenal shape. It had almost a major feel to it the way it got firmed up. Just a great venue. I'm glad we got to come here for sure. But it's always great to finish a tournament like that.  
  
  Q. You hit six fairways, 15 greens and 29 putts. Six fairways doesn't always coincide with 15 greens, and you were able to still get it on the path.   
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, I was, or in the first cut of rough, so it wasn't too bad. Yeah, sometimes -- this is a course where you can bounce it up and get it on the green, and a lot of times the way they've got some of these pins, you can get it just as close bouncing it up as if you were in the middle of the fairway trying to fly it in.  
  
  Q. This is a Ryder Cup year. You had the critical putt the last time the United States played the Ryder Cup at Valhalla. Thoughts of going to Wales in your mind this year?  
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, obviously I want to make that team. It was a great experience last time, and hopefully I can get in the top eight, and if I can't, hopefully I'll play well enough for Corey to give me a look and I'll get on the team.  
  
  Q. Tell me what the leaders are going to see down the stretch on this golf course.   
 J.B. HOLMES: It's tough out there. The wind is kind of swirling there. The last few holes I had a little trouble with that. The pin on 17 is horrendous. You can get a wedge in your hand and you can't even get it within 40 feet of the flag. Something could happen there. If Justin makes a bogey or two and somebody tries to go at that flag or something, you could see something happen there.   
 16, obviously you can make a birdie there pretty easy. But if you hit some fairways, the pins weren't putting too bad on the last few holes.
