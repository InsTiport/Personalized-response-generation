 Q. How is it going to be tomorrow for you guys, playing 36?
 J.B. HOLMES: It's going to be like college again, playing 36 in one day. It happens, and everybody else is going to do it, too, so just have to go out there and deal with it. 

 Q. Is it exhausting to think about 36? 
 J.B. HOLMES: It may be exhausting to play 36 holes, you're putting that much mental effort and everything into it, it's rough.

 Q. How much do you think this much rain is going to change the way this course is playing?
 J.B. HOLMES: You know, we'll see. They have got 12 hours or so to work on the golf course, and it needed a little bit of rain so, we'll just see what happens.
