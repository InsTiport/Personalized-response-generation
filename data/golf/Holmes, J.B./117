  Q. Your stroke looked good.   
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, I'm putting well, if I can get it in there a little bit closer, hopefully I'll make some. I had a lot of putts that looked like they were going in but ended up short or just going over the edge, so I'm putting good.  
  
  Q. Your first Phoenix, you were ahead, and your second you were behind going into the final round --  
 J.B. HOLMES: I was leading both of them.  
  
  Q. So you're pretty used to being a marked man; doesn't bother you too much?   
 J.B. HOLMES: I'm in a pretty good spot. I think we have a little bit of a gap between the final group and the rest of them, so there's a little gap in there.   
 Obviously those guys can play well and get into it, too. It's a little bit of a cushion.   
  
  Q. Which is going to be harder, waiting two days to go out in the final group, or waiting two hours?   
 J.B. HOLMES: I don't know, probably both, will be about the same.  
  
  Q. Take care of a lot of business with one more good round; tournament; Ryder Cup; a lot on the table for you.   
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, one more good round and I'll be in good shape. I'm excited about it.
