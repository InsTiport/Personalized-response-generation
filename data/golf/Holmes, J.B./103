  Q. Final group, obviously you played very well. Overall pretty happy with your round?  
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, happy with my round. I gave a few away early but I really wasn't hitting my driver that great, so the way I finished, I always feel good to finish a tournament like that, especially in the last group.   
  
  Q. I think you had three Top 10s here three years in a row.   
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, it's my third. Just really enjoy it, play well here. It's a great layout, I think it's a great layout on the golf course, greens are always good. I get a little bit closer every year, I've got eighth and then sixth and now third, so maybe next year I can jump up two spots. I really enjoy this golf course. I just do a great job here, too.   
  
  Q. Talk about maybe your goals this year, how this fits into it. Obviously some positive feedback early in the year.   
 J.B. HOLMES: I changed my putting style. I'm working with Stockton, so I mean, that's helped a whole lot. Goals are obviously to get on the Ryder Cup team again, maybe get a couple wins, maybe just be a little more consistent, make more cuts and have some more Top 10s. It's a good start for me. Right out of the gate last week I got 27th, so that's not a bad start, and this week in third that's a good jump up. Hopefully I can continue to play well and keep it going.  
  
  Q. Are you going to Pebble?  
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, I'm actually going to watch the Super Bowl and then I'm going to go to Pebble.
