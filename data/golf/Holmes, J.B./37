Q. Back nine was good to you today?
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah.
Q. What was different for you there?
J.B. HOLMES: We couldn't really get it to start where we wanted to on the front.  We had some swing problems and figured it out, it was an alignment issue.  And I started hitting it like I had the rest of the week.
The front nine was -- I got a little too open and I was hitting a few bad shots, and then got into some bad shots.  I would like to have played the front a little better.
Q. That would have been a great finish, eagle on 16, birdie on 18, too?
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, yeah.  Played great on the back nine.  Putted well, hit good shots, gave myself some opportunities.  It was a great way to finish, especially how it started.  I was glad to be able to come back into some red numbers.
Q. Those holes on the back nine, there has been quite a bit of scoring there this week.  First round had a lot of it today.  Are there some holes that are better for you?
J.B. HOLMES: If you get the wind, you can make some birdies.  10, I'm flipping in a wedge.  And I'm hitting a low iron into the par 5.  And then you've got two wedges in your hand again for the par-4s coming up.  So you've got a chance to make some birdies there.
Q. What do you think you have to do tomorrow?
J.B. HOLMES: I've got to play really low, and Jason has to come back.  He's playing really well.  It's kind of his to lose right now, I think.
