 Q.   You lost your first match, won the next though to go through.   I guess you like this new format?  
J.B. HOLMES:   It's different.   It's a lot of golf.   I think it's great for TV.   I think you get a lot more matchups, a few more people watching the rounds.   And the weekend it's back to the same format.   
It should be fine.   I think during the three matches you're going to get people playing the best, and anybody can get hot one day and get somebody.  
It's different.   It's not true match play, but it's nice to be able to go out and play three rounds of match play just to get in that format little bit.   It's a fun format to play.   I like it.   
   
 Q.   In that you lost that first match, do you get a little more aggressive, knowing that you have to win both the next two?  
J.B. HOLMES:   No, both the same.   I played the same, the same way, and I didn't play very well the first round.   I was able to play a little bit better the other rounds, make a bunch of pars, and get my drives in the fairway and put the pressure on the other guys.   
   
 Q.   Is this a course that exploits your long hitting?  
J.B. HOLMES:   You know, it's a pretty good course.   They have some holes that are longer, and some holes that are shorter.   So you can definitely take advantage in some places, but you've got to hit it in the fairway.   It's pretty knarly, you can get some pretty bad lies.   Long and straight, yes, it's beneficial.   But long and crooked it can get you in trouble.   So you've got to hit the fairways.
