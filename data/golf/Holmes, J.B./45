Q.   Match play is a funny game.   You squared yourself with 1 & 1?
JB HOLMES:   Had a couple of good stretches today and a couple of bad stretches.   Really rough with lies today, so happy to get a win.

Q.   Looks like the wind has picked up a little bit over yesterday?
JB HOLMES:   Yeah, looks like it's blowing a little bit harder.   This rough, sometimes it doesn't look that bad.   I'm having a little trouble and I've really had trouble out of the rough.   So it's different.

Q.   We were just talking, how aware of you with this new format of this scenario around you as you make your way around this golf course?
JB HOLMES:   You don't think about it much while you are playing.   I knew today that I needed Brooks to win, but I wasn't like looking back and making sure.   I was just doing my match playing, because it doesn't matter if I didn't win.   Luckily I won and Brooks made a good comeback here.   So hopefully he wins and we have a chance or I have a chance tomorrow.   That would be nice.
