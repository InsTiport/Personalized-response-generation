  J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, I hit it in the gorse bush and felt like I had a line-of-sight relief.  They felt differently, called in for a second opinion.  I couldn't get another opinion.  I wanted one more opinion because our walking guy said he wasn't really sure about it.  He wanted to get a second opinion, and then they said the second opinion is the final opinion, and I was like, well, the first guy didn't really give his opinion.  But they said that's what it is.  That's final, and that's the rules as they saw it, so that's what we went with.   Q.  So you went and dropped down in the bush?  J.B. HOLMES: Yeah.   Q.  So it's not like a child picked it up?  J.B. HOLMES: Somebody did pick it up.  Somebody picked it up and said they put it back where they want, but like I said, that could have been thing -- if it would have been two feet in another direction, maybe I would have got the relief because I could have got more of a swing on it.  It's unfortunate that it happened out that way.  You would think most spectators would know not to pick up balls.  Like I said, he was a kid.  I'm sure he was excited and thought he found a ball.  I'm not saying I might not have done that, too, when I was that age.  It happened.  It is what it is, and I'll have to move on and go play out tomorrow.   Q.  What did you get there?  J.B. HOLMES: 7.  It was a triple.  I made a lot.  Unfortunate things happened there.
