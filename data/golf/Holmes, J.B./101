  Q. How did you make your birdies? Start with whatever the first one was.   
 J.B. HOLMES: On 2, I hit a driver from the middle about 120 yards, and I hit a pitching wedge to about eight feet and made that.   
 Then on 10, hit my drive left, and then hit a hybrid onto the green and two-putted. Had about 20 feet and left it on the edge for eagle. Two-putted there.  
 15, hit a 7-iron in there about eight feet and made that. That was 15.   
 17, I hit a pitching wedge to about a half inch. The ball was hanging over the lip. I thought it was going to go in for a second.   
  
  Q. Nice. Which hole did you bogey? How did you do that?   
 J.B. HOLMES: I bogeyed 16. I hit it in the bunker and then I hit a pretty good bunker shot to about five or six feet and missed the putt for par.   
  
  Q. Dustin also he said he didn't make a lot of putts out there at the MP. Did it surprise you that the greens were that bumpy? Because they were supposed to be amongst the best.   
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, a little bit. I thought they were gonna be -- but it's two days of footprints if one area, so that's just kind of -- but, yeah, it is pretty down bouncy. There was a couple putts I had around 10, 12 feet that I felt like I made. I don't know if I hit something or it broke more than I thought, but I thought they were in and just didn't go in.   
  
  Q. I'm curious on your impressions of the shore course. A lot of players have been very favorable about it these last couple days?  
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, it's awesome. They did a great job. This is much better than Poppy Hills, I think. The fairways are fairly firm over here, takes water really well, you know, beautiful view. And the golf course, it's a good layout.  
 I think they did a great job changing over to here. Hopefully that'll keep it like this. I think that'll get a better feel if they keep it up like this.   
  
  Q. How long was your round today?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I don't know. I don't even know what time it is right now. I just signed my scorecard, and teed off at 9:50. So whatever time it is.   
  
  Q. Is it all intimidating to be tied with Paul Goydos?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I don't even know who's leading, so I haven't looked at the scoreboards. It's running behind over here.   
  
  Q. Thoughts about Spyglass? How did you like it? How did does it set up for you?  
 J.B. HOLMES: Great. I really like this golf course. Played well there in the past few years on that golf course. Enjoy it. I think it's one of the better layouts we got out here, and it's usually it's in pretty good shape. Looking forward to playing. I really like that golf course.
