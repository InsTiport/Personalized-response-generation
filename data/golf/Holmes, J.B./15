 Q.  Great first round at THE PLAYERS Championship.  4-under.  Talk about your round, please.  
JB HOLMES: Yeah, it was a solid round for me, hit the ball pretty good.  Started off with a couple birdies off the bat and made a couple long putts on the back, so kept it going.  So it was a fun day out there and I had a great up-and-down on 18, so it was just a good finish and a good start to the tournament.   
 Q.  Second shot on 18?  
JB HOLMES: What about it?   
 Q.  What did you have?  
JB HOLMES: I had 190 hole, hit a 6-iron out of the straw and I just pulled it, didn't hit it very good, so got lucky it didn't go in the water, so that was a good bounce.   
 Q.  Were you thinking about going for 12 at all?  
JB HOLMES: No, especially with that pin, it's just not a go-for-it hole right now the way it's designed you can hit a good shot in the middle of the green and roll in the water, so there's too much risk for not enough reward, so I think you'll see most of the guys laying up on that this week.   
 Q.  How do you find this course?  Do you like it?  Suit your eye?  
JB HOLMES: It doesn't suit my eye the best.  I've played well here in the past, there's a few holes that dogleg left.  I like to hit a cut, so I have to work on hitting the draw coming into this tournament.  But it's always in great shape, it's always a fun event to play, great finishing holes, so it's always looking forward to playing it for sure when it comes up.   
 Q.  Do you feel like sometimes your length is negated a little bit here?  
JB HOLMES: Yeah, I feel like a lot of times you can't hit the driver around here.  The fairways run out so you kind of take that out of your hands.  I like hitting the driver, so that's sometimes the frustrating part about this golf course.   
 Q.  How many times did you hit driver today?  
JB HOLMES: I don't know, probably six or seven.   
 Q.  The second shot on 12 did you have any tree trouble or anything?  
JB HOLMES: Today I hit it right in the pine straw, I didn't have any tree trouble or anything I just I hit it about to where I needed to hit it, I don't have a whole lot of great opportunity to that back pin and I just happened to putt one in.   
 Q.  So some of those left holes are a little more inviting but still you won't go for it?  
JB HOLMES: Which holes?   
 Q.  The left hole location on 12?  
JB HOLMES: No, there's no pin where I'll go for it on that hole.  If they move it up to like 230, then I'll go for it, but there's no pin where I'll go for it.   
 Q.  What if you're five shots behind on Sunday?  
JB HOLMES: No.  You got a better chance with a wedge in your hand.  If I'm 10-over I might go for it.  If I'm going to miss the cut.
