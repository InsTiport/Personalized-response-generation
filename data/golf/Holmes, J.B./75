Q.   5â€‘under, good day overall?
JB HOLMES:   Yeah, I had a couple rough breaks.   I had a bunch of birdies, and I hit my drive just a little left on I guess it was 12.   It really wasn't that bad of a shot, hit a tree and kicked in the weeds and couldn't find it and I made a double.   That was really the only one, and that was just kind of bad luck. 
Other than that, I think I misread one short putt, and other than that I hit a lot of good shots and putted well.   Really stuff that couldn't handle much on my side, so it really was a pretty solid round of golf.

Q.   How many drivers did you hit today?
JB HOLMES:   Oh, I don't know, a bunch.

Q.   Is this a course you can attack?
JB HOLMES:   Yeah, I can hit several drivers out there.   There's some landing areas you can get it out there.   I probably hit seven or eight maybe. 

Q.   Is this your first time playing here?
JB HOLMES:   Second time.

Q.   What are your thoughts on the area, the course?
JB HOLMES:   Oh, I like it here.   The course is in great shape.   It's fun to play, beautiful view over the lake.   Like I said, it's a nice city.   It's neat to come over here and experience another culture.
