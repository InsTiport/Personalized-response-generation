Q. Recap of your round, one of the low rounds of day so far.
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, you know, played great really.  Left a few out there.  Didn't make as many putts as I would've like to, but I hit it great.  I hit almost all the greens, and when I didn't hit the green I hit it close.
Just didn't get as many putts to fall as I would like, but I played great.  I was a fun day out there.
Q. Starting earlier in the day kind of like Thursday where you got out to an early charge.  Did it kind of seem like a momentum in a similar way?
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, definitely got it going a little bit better.  Still couldn't really make any birdies coming in.  I had a lot of the chances.  The back nine a little tougher holes going out into the wind.
You know, coming in had some chances and just didn't make the putts.
Q. Wind seemed a lot worse today.
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, it's gusty too.  Like it would be blowing really hard and then it'll stop.  It's tricky to kind of figure out.
It's a little bit trickier.  Had some pins in some good spots so I'm pleased with it, but you know how golfers are, always could be better.
Q. Catch a little grief from the guys in front of you for the tee shot on 10?
J.B. HOLMES: I didn't think I could get it there.  I thought maybe it would just get to the front.  I didn't think it would quite to the green.
No, they're both good guys.  They won't give my too much crap.
Q. Seeing as it's moving day, do you feel like at this point you might have done enough to put yourself in position to maybe make a run?
J.B. HOLMES: I would have to shoot -- I have a chance tomorrow, but I think I will have to shoot 6 or 7 to really of a chance.
We'll see how the leaders do today, but I'm guessing the leads is probably going to be 12, 13 at the end of the day.  That puts me five or six back, so I definitely would have to put up a good round tomorrow.
Q. You've shot 60 here before.
J.B. HOLMES: I have shot 60 here before.  That might do it.
Q. What's your plans for the rest of the night and seeing how the guys still out on the course are doing?
J.B. HOLMES: I probably won't look at it.  Probably just go back and hang out with my family and stuff that are here.  Get my tee time and go out tomorrow.
