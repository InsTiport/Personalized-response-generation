Q.   A solid day for you.   Nothing spectacular, but you gotta be pleased with a 2‑under 68.
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah.   It was definitely more difficult in the afternoon.   The wind was really swirling around.   I mean it was kind of just going opposite direction, picking up a lot of speed.   So it was difficult to get a ball close to the hole, and you know, 2‑under is‑‑ I think it's a pretty good round for this afternoon.   So I'm happy with it. 
Like you said, didn't really do anything spectacular, but really didn't make any mistakes.   So a solid round for me.

Q.   Is this a course where you can use your length to your advantage or do you have to kind of reel it in a little bit?
J.B. HOLMES:   You know, this is a good golf course because on some holes it does give me the advantage and some holes you do have to reel it back a little bit.   I think it's a good golf course.   It's one of those weeks where you don't usually see a big hitter always winning it or a short hitter always winning it or great short‑game player.   The tournament's kind of had all kinds of winners.   So it's kind of one of those golf courses that anybody can win.   So it's a fun week.

Q.   You know, the crowd every time you pulled out a driver and Bubba pulled out a driver, they were all, who's going to be the longest?   Who's the furthest out there.   Do you get caught up in that at all?
J.B. HOLMES:   No.   I mean you can't really get caught up into that.   We hit it both about the same distance.   When we hit the same shots and one was two yards further.   I mean it was pretty much the exact same, you know.   The fairways were soft, so if you got one to bounce, it would be further than the other one.   So we were kind of right there.   As long as everybody is having fun, that's the main thing.

Q.   It was fun to watch.   Keep it going.
J.B. HOLMES:   All right.   Thanks a lot.
