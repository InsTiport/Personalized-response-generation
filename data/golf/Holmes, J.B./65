 Q.   You rolled 3 on the card to get it in at 67 today?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, I was trying to roll it down there and have an easy second putt was all I was really hoping for, because the putt can get away from you.   I never really thought it was going in until ‑‑ I thought it was too high, I thought I hit it too hard, and then it broke a lot, so it was nice to get that one to go in.   
I burned the edges quite a few today, so it was nice to get one of those to go in.  
   
 Q.   Well, you got it to go in the back.   Just ten putts on the back nine.   These are quick, really fast‑‑ we know they're going to get faster greens.   How do you manage your way around these putting surfaces, because they get lightning fast?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, you just got to hit it in the right spot.   I was hitting it really well today.   I had a lot of close birdie opportunities.   And it's easier to make putts when you're closer to the hole for sure.   Hit it great today.   
And then on the greens when I did miss it I was able to get good chip shots get close to it not put myself into too much trouble.   You got to hit fairways and greens.   That's a big plus out here because you gotta have some opportunities because they are very fast and if you hit it in the wrong spot you can definitely make bogey real quick.  
   
 Q.   Seems like length can be a factor if you can get it out there on the par 5s reachable, how do you manage when you let it go and when you don't on the golf course?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, there's a couple you can let it go at 'em, like the first pin on the front.   And 4 and 5, you can't hit the 3‑wood off of that, you can't really do that.   
Next one I can feel pretty good, go to that corner and have an iron into it.   And didn't birdie it today.   Had a 6‑iron there.   Hit a bad shot.   And on 11, since I like to play (indiscernible), that one is a hard fairway for me to hit.   Put it in the fairway, you can have an opportunity.   Difficult shot.   Sometimes you might be better off with some of those holes, you might be better off laying up.   I got birdie today laying up.   And the last one definitely, everybody can get it there.   But if you can get it closer, to the top of the hill, get a 4‑iron, a little bit, something with a little height on it, easier than hitting a 3‑wood in.   
Some opportunities out here.   But I hit a lot of 3‑woods on this golf course, too.   I only hit six or seven drivers.   It's not something where I'm going out and just swinging as hard as I can.
