 Q.  J.B., overall comments on the match, how it went, a little back and forth?  
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, we played really well.  Kind of gave him one on 16 when I hit that putt so far past.  I can't put my partner in that position.  That was frustrating.   
We definitely had our opportunities.  We gave one there, and then a chance to get up-and-down for birdie on the hole before.   
So it was disappointing I guess the way it ended.  We felt like we played well enough to win, but they played really well.  And every time we got up a couple, they battled back and threw in a birdie.  It was a great match.   
 Q.  Talk about the confidence you have playing with Bubba.  
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, we're going good.  We're feeding off each other and been playing well.  So looking forward to this afternoon and should be a lot of fun.
