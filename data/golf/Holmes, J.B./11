 Q.  Just talk a little bit about your round and the thought process that went into it.  Do you think six shots is going to be reachable, maybe?  
J.B. HOLMES: Usually when you shoot even in a U.S. Open and you're one off the lead, you're not six down afterwards.  So definitely left some out there today.  Could have played a little better, but made some good scrappy pars.  Just didn't play that bad, just got in a few spots today where I had some good shots and didn't turn out the way I wanted to.  It is what it is.   
We'll see.  Somebody shot 9-under today.  So if that's out there, you never know, depending on the conditions.  If it's nice like this again, then maybe, but it will take a low round, because guys are playing well out there.   
 Q.  Say the wind comes up, what does that do to the leaderboard?  
J.B. HOLMES: If the wind picks up, a lot of stuff can happen, you never know.  If the wind comes up then maybe I shoot -- you can throw a 5-under and that could win, so you never know.  We'll see what happens tomorrow.
