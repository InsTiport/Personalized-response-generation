 Q.   Just get a par out of that one.   Talk about that how that helped the round.  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah.   I pushed my 3-wood, kind of a tough lie.   Wasn't that bad of a swing.   Hit the cart path.   I got a bad bounce there went under that tree and I was lucky enough to be able to have a little bit of a swing on it.   It wasn't probably as hard as it looked.   
I had a good shot out of there, got caught in the grass by the green.   Made a good two-putt from there.   Lucky enough I could get a club on it.   Not so lucky I hit the cart path.   Just golf.   It was a good one for me.  
   
 Q.   Where do you feel like your game is at from a few weeks ago?  
J.B. HOLMES:   I'm hitting the ball really well.   Last week I hit it well, too.   I didn't putt so well.   So this week I really worked on the last few days, we worked on my putting.   Figured some stuff out and putting a lot better today.   I just continue to hit it well and get some putts to go in, feel good about my game.  
   
 Q.   What is it about this golf course that you like?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Really doesn't suit my eyes.   There's a lot of holes that go left.   I played well here.   I played well here several times.   I like the golf course, I like the atmosphere.   Lot of holes that I hit a cut.   I tend to play it well.   So, you know, it's always nice.   It's a great crowd.   The course is always in great shape.   Fun to come back here and play.  
   
 Q.   What you shot for an opening round, do you still feel you have to go really low tomorrow to stay with the rest of the leaders or do you feel you're sort of in a good position?  
J.B. HOLMES:   I'm in a good shot spot.   Every event someone will shoot 7, 8-under in the 1st Round.   Tomorrow could be 7 again or might be 8, 9.   Usually won't jump that much.   So, I'm in a good spot.   
Shoot 3-under all four days I think depending on the weather and the wind, that's going to be a pretty good score.   We'll see.   I'm in a good spot right now.   Long ways away.   I'm going to go tomorrow and one shot at a time.  
   
 Q.   J.B., you're the winner of multiple events right now.   You're defending for the first time in quite sometime here though.   How does that feel?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Good.   Got to look at it just another week.   Had a lot of good memories the last year here.   Brought in the good memories and didn't put any pressure on myself.   Just went out and played and had a good start.  
   
 Q.   When you look at your career, it seems like last year here that week was vitally important to you.  
J.B. HOLMES:   Well, you know, I've been working really hard to get to that point.   I had been playing well up until that point.   I hadn't got a win.   It came together that week for me and definitely get in the Winner's Circle, give a confidence boost.   
Gets you into a few extra tournaments.   Nice to be able to get into a few more of the world events, being able to play against the best players.   Continue the momentum.  
   
 Q.   No doubt about that.   Talk about today.   How does the golf course look compared to a year ago?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Little different wind today so it played a lot longer than it has in the past.   Hadn't really seen this wind before.   9 I'm hitting 8, 9-iron.   Today I had 220.   Hit a 4-iron.   The hole played really different.   It was playing a little bit longer out there.   It's in good shape.   Fun tract to play so looking forward to the rest of the week.  
   
 Q.   You think scoring will be similar to what it's been in the years past or a little tougher?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Little bit tougher today.   You always going to have some guy shoot 7 or something, get really hot.   In general if the wind keeps up then the scores might be a little bit higher today than it has in the past.
