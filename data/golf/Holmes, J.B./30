 Q.  Talk about today.  You have to be really pleased, especially those four straight birdies on the back side?  
J.B. HOLMES: Definitely, that gets you going for sure.  So I got a good run there.  And I actually 3-putted the hole before I started that, so that was -- I thought I made a wedge, it lipped out and then I don't know what happened on the second putt, I thought I hit a pretty good putt and then it shot right on me.  But late stretch was good.  Hit some good shots, made some good putts and it got me going and put me up towards the top.   
 Q.  How would you describe course conditions because it seemed a little soft out there?  
J.B. HOLMES: I've seen it a lot softer here.  It was still bouncing a little bit.  But got a little rain on Wednesday and I think Tuesday night, so it softened it up.  It was firmer than that on Monday and Tuesday.  So it's a little soft.  I've seen it a lot wetter out here, but getting a little bit of roll.   
 Q.  Do you feel this is place that's suited for your game perfectly?  
J.B. HOLMES: I feel like I can play anywhere, but, yeah, this course sets up pretty good for me.  So I'm happy -- it's always great to start here, get the invite to this one.  It means you did something good the year before.  So just a fun week.   
 Q.  The mindset, you got to go low.  The birdie machine's got to be on all four days, doesn't it?  
J.B. HOLMES: Well, you never know.  Depends on weather and everything else.  You just got to go out and do the best you can each day.  And yeah, there's been some low numbers before to win, but I think 16 or 17 has won before, too.  So it depends on what gets going and where they put the pins and how hard the wind blows.   
 Q.  All right.  Keep it going.  
J.B. HOLMES: Thanks.
