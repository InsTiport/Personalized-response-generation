Q.   14 of 18 greens, along with just 25 putts, sounds like a 65 to me. 
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, it was a good round for me.   I played great.   Hit my irons really good, made the putts I needed to.   It was just a good day for me.   I hit the ball pretty straight, so it was just a solid round.

Q.   I was impressed with the control of your driver.   You've always been massive off the tee, but to be able to hit fairways really helps?
J.B. HOLMES:   Oh, yeah, for sure.   I've been trying to work on hitting it a little straighter.   I made a few bad swings out there, but for the most part, I hit the ball pretty straight off the tee.

Q.   We've documented you've had brain surgery, a broken ankle, you've been really battling injuries for the past couple years.   Are you a hundred percent?   How close are you mentally to winning a tournament again? 
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, I think I'm a hundred percent healthâ€‘wise.   I'm back to where I'm at, and mentally I think I'm in a great spot.   I've really been working on it the last year.   I worked hard on the mental game while I was off, and I feel really good.   I feel the best I've felt on the golf course in a long time.

Q.   Looks like these greens are still receptive? 
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, they're a little receptive.   Yesterday it was hard to putt on because it got chewed up pretty good.   So this afternoon we'll see if those guys can still make some putts.   They were pretty good this morning.

Q.   Look forward to you playing on the weekend. 
J.B. HOLMES:   Thank you.
