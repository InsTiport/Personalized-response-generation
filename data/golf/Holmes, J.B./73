 Q.   Another good round for you out here today.   You birdied two of the last three.   Thoughts on how you played today?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, I played really well.   I actually hit it a lot better than I did yesterday and just didn't make quite as many putts.   
I putted really well yesterday.   I putted great today, too.   It was just all around, it was just a solid round.  
I had one bad hole.   One bad play on 11.   Other than that I hit a lot of great shots.  
   
 Q.   11 of 18 fairways, but I guess you couldn't have been missing by much.   At the 9th, your last hole, you were in the rough but still made birdie?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, I thought that was going to end up in the fairway, but just went out.   And was able to hit a really good shot out of the rough.   Hit a lot of fairways today.   This golf course is a lot of 3‑woods for me.   I have a new 3‑wood this year that I really like that I'm able to control really well.   That's paid off a lot.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts on the course conditions.   Looked like the greens were firming up a little bit.   A little bit more breeze today?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah.   This is the best shape I've ever seen this golf course in.   The greens are absolutely perfect.   They're fast and they are firming up.   Today is a lot firmer than it was yesterday.   Considering the weather is going to be good, there's a little bit more wind, so the greens will probably get firmer and the course is going to get tougher and tougher.
