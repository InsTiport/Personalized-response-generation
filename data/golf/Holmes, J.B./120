 Q. A 69, wow, I mean, that's the best round right now. 
 J.B. HOLMES: Oh, really? Wow. I'm surprised. Yeah, I was just trying to play well today and I got hot on the front and just tried to put up a good score.

 Q. How about the wind? Obviously the course is very different, but you throw the wind in there too?
 J.B. HOLMES: With no wind yesterday I played pretty good. And then you throw the wind in there, it's pretty tough out there. The wind might have been a little bit slower today and that might have saved it from being some really tough scores. But it's really tough out there. It's swirling around in the trees a lot.

 Q. Why do you think you were able to succeed where others have failed so badly here?
 J.B. HOLMES: I don't know. I made some birdies and I made some putts. And when I did get in trouble I just tried to chip it out and try not to make it be a double, just make a bogey. You can make up for a bogey. It's hard to make up for doubles and triples. 

 Q. Are the greens so tough out there that you have to be awake every second? Are they really that treacherous?
 J.B. HOLMES: You miss some of these greens and the rough's so long and they're so fast you just don't have any chance of -- you can't even go at the flag when you're chipping. John Rollins went in the bunker today on -- I forget what hole it was, but his only shot was like 30 yards in front of the green, because if he hits it up to the flag it's in the water. So, you know, it's a hard shot anyway and the bunkers are so soft and they plug some, so you can make big numbers really quick just really by not hitting that bad a shot.

 Q. That 69 on this course in these conditions, what's that equivalent to on a normal course setup?
 J.B. HOLMES: Whatever you want to say it is. 

 Q. You thought it was pretty good, but to do what you did in conditions like this, that's got to pump you up a little bit?
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah. I usually play pretty good in the wind, just getting that putter rolling and I made a few putts today and I guess I played solid, but a 69 on Thursday or Friday doesn't win you the tournament. So it gets me to the weekend and if I can put up a couple more of those I might win the tournament. So I'm excited about just getting in and getting a good round in and giving me a chance to move up a little bit tomorrow. If it blows like this tomorrow and I shoot 2-under, you know, I might be right in the thick of things. So I think that just three guys really kind of pulled away, haven't they? I don't know. 4-under, 6-under, something like that. 6 and 7? So --

 Q. So you don't want it to quiet down?
 J.B. HOLMES: I don't know. I would rather it not be dead calm. I usually play pretty good in windy conditions. So a little bit of wind, I don't want it to be any more than it was today. Today was tough. So if it got much harder than this, if it blew real hard out here the balls would blow off the green and we couldn't even play. 

 Q. Do you want some rain tonight?
 J.B. HOLMES: The greens are holding pretty good. They're receptive. A little bit of rain might be okay. 

 Q. You said you played great yesterday and didn't get much out of it, that 74, today you shoot 69. Did you play great or better?
 J.B. HOLMES: I hit more greens today. Really yesterday I was playing really good and my back tightened up on me on the last six or seven holes and that's when the shots went bad. I was playing pretty good up to then. If that wouldn't have happened I might is have been able to save a few more shots. But that's over. 

 Q. How many drivers do you hit on this course?
 J.B. HOLMES: About four. I can't hit driver out here very much. I can push it up to maybe six, but that's being a little aggressive. If I'm playing smart and playing the way I should be, four, maybe five. 

 Q. How much do you have to account for the wind even on putting?
 J.B. HOLMES: You know, it wasn't too bad today on the greens, I didn't think. I thought most of the greens were either covered or it wasn't blowing hard enough to really, really affect them on the greens. It was a couple maybe, but not really bad. It was more just your approach shots. The wind was swirling so much you couldn't judge the distance very well. And then when you don't judge your distance well it goes in the bunker or the rough and then it turns into a bogey and then the greens are fast and you 3-putt. So that's where it gets going. 
 And it wasn't -- when I was out there it wasn't, I didn't have anything that was really, really affected by the wind that much. There were a couple holes, but it wasn't that bad.
