 Q.   Like I said, looks like we're not going back out today, but you're obviously off to a great start, 4‑under today through I think just about eight holes, so gotta be feeling good?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah.   I felt good coming into today.   Leading, so I knew I had to put in an under par round, so I started off great.   In the middle of the fairway.   It was hot, so it kind of felt like we were probably not going to finish.   But I'll come out tomorrow and hopefully have a good back nine and put myself in contention.  
   
 Q.   What kind of history have you had here?   Does this course set up well for you?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, I haven't played very well here in the past.   I think I've missed the cut a couple of times and maybe finished 40th or something.   
So you know, in the past it hasn't set up real great for me, but the whole golf course can change with enough rain.   It was firm.   We'll see how it plays tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Obviously this is your first involvement where you deal with a lot of things like rain delays all the time.   Is there anything ‑‑ do you just come back out and hope to pick back up with where you left off tomorrow?  
J.B. HOLMES:   I mean it's just one shot at a time.   That's really it.   If you can get to where you can really focus on that and not let things bother you.   That's sort of the only thing you can control.   That's the main goal of probably everybody out here is the better they can focus on one shot at a time, the better off you'll be.   
That's just how you gotta be.   Gotta go out and warm up tomorrow and go into it just like you're starting on one and just try to remember the birdies and everything I had yesterday, and I just feel good coming off the golf course, so I got positive thoughts and hopefully I'll go out there tomorrow and just continue with positive swings.
