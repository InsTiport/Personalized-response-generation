Q. How would you describe the conditions this afternoon?
JB HOLMES: Until the last three holes it was very windy and very tough.  Hard to hit fairways -- it was hard for me to hit fairways.  Yeah, it was just tough.  Just pars were a good score and some of the pins you tried not to get greedy and just tried to get up there and get your par and try to make a birdie when you can.  It was definitely very difficult.
Q. 25 putts today on greens that were really hard.  What do you attribute your fine putting to?
JB HOLMES: I've been putting good this week, so the speed of the greens feels really good, I've got the weights in my putter right where I want them and putted well.  I'm seeing the lines and hitting good speeds and putts are going in.  So, I was on the fringe a few times, so that might make the 25 seem -- but I putted great today.
Q. You were playing some of your shots on the course pretty adventurous to places.
JB HOLMES: Yeah, that's not new for me though.  I grew up in the woods playing golf, so I learned how to hit fairways when I got on TOUR.  Today was just a throw back to how I played junior golf.  So obviously it's a lot less stressful in the fairway, but it was tough out there today with the wind and everything and getting in the fairway.  And I was able to, when I did miss it, I missed it spots where I could get around the green and have a chance to get up-and-down.
