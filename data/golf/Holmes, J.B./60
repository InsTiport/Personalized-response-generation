  J.B. HOLMES:   I needed that finish for sure.   Got off to a really, really rough start early.   Just putter left me for a few holes and misread a couple of short putts and raining, before you know it I was 5‑over.   It was good to be able to finish strong on the back. 

Q.   How much was a factor was the weather? 
J.B. HOLMES:   I mean, it was definitely a factor.   It's harder to reach the lies on the grass and sometimes in the fairway, it sticks in the ground a little bit more. 
When it's raining, it's a little bit more difficult.   Right now it's not too bad.   Hopefully the afternoon guys will get a little rain on them too.   We had about nine holes of it.
It's definitely a factor.   Still some people that played okay out there.   You can still get it.

Q.   Did you make any adjustments?   What was the biggest difference for you? 
J.B. HOLMES:   I started making some putts again.   I had some good opportunities on the back, and I made them.   And just starting out on the front, I missed a short putt on‑‑ just missed a few iron shots in the wrong spot, got a couple of bad lies misread a couple of short putts and it can get a way from you real quick.

Q.   Was the putt on 2 just a momentum turner?
J.B. HOLMES:   That definitely helped, helped to get it together.   Probably the biggest putt, I made a 15‑footer on 6.   I was sitting there at 1‑over and I had 15‑footer for par.   If I miss that, I go to 2.   I made that and was able to birdie the last three.   So that was a big putt for me.

Q.   Does it start to weigh on you after the back nine that you might not make the cut? 
J.B. HOLMES:   I mean, you think about it when you start getting a couple over.   I knew I had a few to play with.   I'd rather it gone the other way today.   But I knew I could put a good score up on the front.   I thought even was the number, when I turned I was at 2‑over.   I definitely thought I could get 2 on the front and ended up getting 4.   Take that for sure.
