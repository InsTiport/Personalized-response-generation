 Q.  With the victorious American side, J.B. Holmes and Bubba Watson.  What made you two guys mesh so well today?  
BUBBA WATSON: Well, if you look at us, we're awesome looking, first of all.  But if you look at it, we play the same game.  We hit a driver pretty well, we can find the fairways, and we hit long irons pretty well.  We chip and putt pretty good.  And J.B. putted really good today.  That's why I picked him as a partner, because I knew he was going to putt unbelievable the last few weeks.  It was fun.   
 Q.  J.B., you kind of sneaked into this team after Jim Furyk had to not play because of a bad wrist.  What does it mean for you to be able to go out here and earn a point on the first day?  
J.B. HOLMES: It feels great.  I was just happy to be able to have a chance to play.  I felt bad for Jim, but excited about the opportunity.  And once we got over here and kind of played around a little bit with alternate shot, me and Bubba, and we just played excellent in all the practice rounds together, so we really liked how the course set up and how we were playing.   
So to us, it was a no-brainer to come out here and just play aggressive and play well, and today we did what we wanted to do.   
 Q.  You certainly took advantage of that opportunity.  Thanks, guys.  
BUBBA WATSON: Thanks a lot.   
 Q.  Putting contest, I guess.  At the end of the day, it came down to the putting.  
BUBBA WATSON: Yes, but the key is on these days like this, we're all good players.  We made it here for a reason because we're top players in the world.  So when you look at it, it's going to come down, especially on a course like this, soft fairways, everybody's hitting it on the fairways, that means more greens, more irons into the greens, more birdie putts.   
So for this competition, and especially today, these tricky greens, it's who makes putts.  If you look, we started off hot, we started off making the putts and then we ended up making the putts.  Right in the middle both teams were not making putts.  They looked good, but they didn't go in, so it was all about putting, and this golf course is going to be about putting and controlling the speed and making the ten footers.   
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, the greens were real tricky where they put a couple of these pins.  We thought hit a pretty good spots.   
BUBBA WATSON: We almost four-putted.   
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, we both on the par-3, 13, I thought I hit a pretty good putt and it ended up being 20 feet away.  He thought he hit a pretty good putt.   
BUBBA WATSON: But none of us three-putted.   
J.B. HOLMES: That's true.  You had two, and I had one.   
 Q.  Like the way you think.  You obviously feel comfortable on these greens.  I would say the putt on 15 was maybe the most crucial.  
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, that was a big putt for us right there.  1-up is kind of nothing, but if you get 2 with a few holes, it definitely makes an advantage, so that definitely was a huge putt for us.  Bubba put it down there in a good spot for me.  It was one of those that you got to have some uphill putts out here.  If you get going downhill, they can get away from you.
