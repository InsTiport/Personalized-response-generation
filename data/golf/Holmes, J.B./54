Q.   Course playing difficult? 
JB HOLMES:   Yeah, it's very difficult right now.   It's a lot of fun out there.   The course is in good shape.   Greens are getting real firm.   So we'll see what the weather does to it tomorrow, but yeah, it's tough out there right now.

Q.   If I put everyone 150 yards from the hole, with the swirling breezes and everything‑‑
JB HOLMES:   Somebody would, but not a whole lot.   You'd be surprised how many wouldn't do it.   It's difficult to hit the greens right now and being firm and trying to get them to stay on the greens is difficult.   So, it's tough.

Q.   Are you looking for weather to come in tonight or would you like it to play hard on Sunday? 
JB HOLMES:   I'd like it to stay how it is.   Hopefully it won't be in the rain, but if it is, be ready for that.
