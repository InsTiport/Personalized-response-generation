  Q. 3-under par 69. Talk about the round and how the course is playing.   
 J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, the wind picked up and made it definitely more difficult. It's tough out there. The greens were still in good shape so you could make some putts, but it got windy enough you were trying to read some of the wind into it. It was tough, especially 18. 18 played really difficult. I hit a pretty good 3-wood and a hard, hard 5-iron and it jumped a little on me and got to the middle of the green. That hole is playing very difficult.   
 You've got to score on the holes when you get a chance. There's a couple holes out there where the wind is with you. You've got to be able to access those pins and make some birdies, and then on the holes that's into the wind and stuff, you've just got to grip down and try to make par.   
  
  Q. 9-under par is worth keeping loose and hanging around, right?   
 J.B. HOLMES: Sure, I haven't looked at the leaderboard much, but I'll stay around.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about your performance today?   
 J.B. HOLMES: I feel good. 3-under is a great round today, moved me up the leaderboard, so it was a good Sunday for me. I've been wanting to -- I haven't had any real good Sundays this year, and that was a solid round.  
  
  Q. Everyone talks about 17 being tough. Is that do you think the hardest hole out here?  
 J.B. HOLMES: No, that hole is not that hard. You can make a big number, but you've got a wedge in your hand. I played it 3-over and I'm saying not too hard. You can hit a decent shot and bounce it and go over. I'd say 18 is the hardest hole out here definitely, but you can make some big numbers on 17 for sure.  
  
  Q. What's your favorite thing about playing this course?   
 J.B. HOLMES: You know, the finishing holes. A lot of stuff happens on 16, 17 and 18, so it's a fun tournament to watch.
