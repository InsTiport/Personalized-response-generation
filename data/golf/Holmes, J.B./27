Q. You got that early bogey out of the way at the first hole and played solid out here at Spyglass.
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, I had a great round.  It was just beautiful weather and I was just trying to stay present and enjoy the scenery and got some putts to go in today.
Q. When you think of the rotation, the three golf courses, is this the one that you hope to get decent weather, because if it's bad, this is usually the hardest of the three.
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, definitely.  This one of the three courses, I think, is the most difficult golf course.  So it's good to get a decent number out here and hopefully, we have great weather all week.  It was perfect today.  And go out and enjoy the beautiful golf courses and have fun.
Q. Tell me about the pro celebrity format.  You played with a couple of pretty good guys and pretty good golfers too.
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, Aaron and Chris, definitely some good golfers.  And we had a lot of fun, hit some great shots today.  Everybody did.  So it was just a blast.  Such a beautiful place and the weather's just perfect right now.  So it was a lot of fun.
Q. Hope for the same weather tomorrow?
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, all week.
Q. What was the key to the round today?
J.B. HOLMES: I putted really well, but I did everything pretty good.  I started a little slow, but I really hit a lot of good putts and saved some -- hit a couple 10-footers for par to save, maybe, some bogeys.  I saved one on 10 and like 6, I had a 10-footer to save par and that kind of kept it going.  After the first par-5, I played the par-5s very well.
