 Q.  I know that wasn't the finish you wanted, but you really put up a great battle on that back nine.  How much fun was it to be involved in this final nine holes of the Travelers Championship?  
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, it was great.  Like you said, I didn't finish the way I wanted to, but had a great day, played well, putted well, and we just misread some putts there at the end.  Actually, I hit all my putts right where I was aiming.  That last putt was on a big slope and we thought it would break and it didn't.  But it was a good week for me, I played well.   
 Q.  I wanted to ask you about the week overall.  This is easily your best finish at this tournament.  What was the difference this year playing at TPC River Highlands?  
J.B. HOLMES: I just felt good about my game.  Like I said, I've been putting well, so the putter really made me feel confident over the greens this week.  I hit some good iron shots, so it was just a solid week.   
 Q.  You got in contention.  How can you describe the final round for you?  
J.B. HOLMES: It was a good round for me.  I played solid.  Didn't finish like I wanted to, but I hit a lot of good shots today, hit a lot of great putts and just came up a few short.   
 Q.  How would you characterize what unfolded down the stretch when you were basically in the thick of it?  
J.B. HOLMES: I actually didn't look at the scoreboard all day.  I didn't really know.  I was just trying to do the best I could.  I knew in the last I had to hole out that wedge, and I just hit a bad shot and got a squirrely lie over there.  I hit a decent chip and hit my putt where I was looking, but missed it.  It's the way it goes.  I made a lot of putts this week, played well, and it was a good week.   
 Q.  A number of rounds on PGA TOUR events under par (inaudible)?  
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, played well the last three tournaments, so hopefully I can keep that momentum going and get a win under my belt.  But playing solid right now.   
 Q.  Did you say (inaudible)?  
J.B. HOLMES: 17, I had no idea.   
 Q.  So you really weren't watching?  
J.B. HOLMES: No, I was just doing what I could do.  I can't control what anybody else is doing.   
 Q.  You mentioned you had a pretty good week, but the last like two holes kind of disappointed you, but, otherwise, you're right in the hunt.  
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, just the last hole.  The other two holes were fine.  I made a great shot on the par-3, and I hit the putt exactly where I was aiming, and we misread it.  Hit a good shot on 17 in there.  Didn't come down the hill, misread that one.  And 18, I just hit a bad shot.   
 Q.  Are you able to move on now because of that and say, you know what, if I put myself in this position often I'm going to be in really good shape?  Give yourself a chance to win as often as possible and good things will come?  
J.B. HOLMES: Yeah, absolutely.  I've won out here before.  I know what it takes.  I'm playing well right now, so hopefully I can keep giving myself opportunities.  It's hard to win out here.  You've got guys shooing 7-under.  You've got guys going low all the time, so you've got to have things go your way, and you've got to capitalize.
