  Q.  J.B., if you can, describe what's going through your mind right now?   
 J. B. HOLMES:  I got beat.  Nothing to go through my mind.   
  
  Q.  Was there a point during that backside that you thought you had the match won at all?   
 J. B. HOLMES:  You're playing the best player in the world.  I got 3-up with four or five to play and I was, like, let's not do anything stupid here.  Make him make birdies and make him beat you if he's going to do it.  And he did.  He started making tons of putts.  There's not much you can do when he played 5- or 6-under in the last four or five holes.  What do you do?   
  
  Q.  You hung tough.   
 J. B. HOLMES:  Thanks.   
  
  Q.  You must be quite proud of yourself, you played very well there today.   
 J. B. HOLMES:  Yeah, I played all right.  I'm a little frustrated.  I really thought I'd make that putt right there.  And I hit a good putt, we just misread it.  Me and my caddie both just misread it.  It broke more than we thought.  You have to give it up to him.  He struggled a little bit early in the round and then made every putt he looked at when he needed to.  That's why he's the best.   
  
  Q.  You couldn't have done much more, you were 3-up early, weren't you 3-up after 13?   
 J. B. HOLMES:  I think I shot 2- or 3-under on the backside.  I didn't choke or I didn't back down or anything like that.  So I'm not -- I'm disappointed I didn't win.  But I didn't fall apart, like you see some people -- it's happened around him.  I gave him a battle, and today he just won.   
  
  Q.  Did you enjoy the experience?   
 J. B. HOLMES:  Yeah, it was a great experience.  Tiger is a super guy, very pleasant to play with.  He just played better today.   
  
  Q.  How different is the atmosphere playing with him?   
 J. B. HOLMES:  Not as much as I thought it would be, other than the tons of people around.  But it wasn't -- he played well.  He came through when he needed to.  It was fun to play with him.
