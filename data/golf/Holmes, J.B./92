 Q. Talk about the conditions you were facing yesterday afternoon to today.
 J.B. HOLMES: It was pretty tough. The wind was blowing pretty hard, difficult to get it close. Especially the first four holes it was a little difficult to get through those holes even par. If you did that you were in good shape.
 Coming in you could make a few birdies, but it was still fairly difficult. You had to play a lot of wind. The ball was going a long way downwind.
 Today was pretty much perfect. A little bit of breeze, but not much. The greens were good. So it was an opportunity to make some birdies.

 Q. Hearing the horn yesterday was it a relief to know you're getting out of those conditions and going to the morning where it seemed to be pretty mild?
 J.B. HOLMES: I didn't really know what to expect this morning. I didn't check yesterday, but, yeah, I mean it was starting to get hard to see, so it was nice to -- actually I was getting on a stretch where the wind would have helped me, so I could have played a few more holes. But this morning you can't ask for much better conditions than this.

 Q. How much is length an advantage here as far as 6 and some of the par-5s and the longer par-4s?
 J.B. HOLMES: Doesn't do much difference on 6. The long par-5s it really can, or long par-4s it can definitely help you. Some of the short hitters are having trouble maybe even getting there. You can hit a good shot with a 4-iron or 3-iron in and it makes par a little easier on those holes there.
