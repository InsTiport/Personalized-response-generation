  MARK WILLIAMS: J.B. Holmes, thank you for coming in, runner-up. Obviously, a little disappointed.  
 J.B. HOLMES: Hit a bad tee shot.  
 MARK WILLIAMS: Fire away, people.  
  
  Q. J.B., when we talked to you earlier, you finished 18. We asked you about that hole. You said standing on the tee was scary the first time. Was that still in your mind when you got there?  
 J.B. HOLMES: No. I got into a playoff. It was still a tough shot. But I didn't get to that point by being scared. That was just -- it was a tough hole.  
  
  Q. Was it hard waiting that long, just -- can you put that into words?  
 J.B. HOLMES: It was rough. I wasn't that far behind the leaders starting the day. If everything would have went like it was supposed to, I probably would have been a little bit closer. Waiting almost three hours -- no excuse, but it was rough and so --  
Q. What did you do to pass the time?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I was watching the TV, and then I went and warmed up after Paul hit his tee shot on 17.  
  
  Q. How different were the conditions? When you finished, the wind wasn't quite as bad?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I thought the wind was much harder when I hit -- when I played it the first time. I ripped a drive the first time, and if I would have hit 3-wood off that hole, I couldn't have got to the green. It was blowing quite a bit harder when I stepped up to the hole earlier than it was the second time, but, you know, I didn't hit a good shot.  
  
  Q. Was there -- how much of the hole, not only this week in winning, but was there --  
J.B. HOLMES: Wasn't even thinking about it. Nothing had happened yet.  
  
  Q. Do you -- do you look at the playoff as that was the Tournament? Or when you look back at today, are there going to be points in the final round when where you look at it --  
J.B. HOLMES: I finished the round off good. I made putts when I needed to and finished off. It was just positive. I mean, if I had hit the last putt on 18 another 3 feet, it would have went in the hole. I read it great. I didn't hit it hard enough.   
 You know, Paul did a good job. He played great all day, held it together coming down to the last few holes, and, you know, he deserves to win.  
  
  Q. What difference does it make? You probably had the best back-9 of almost anybody in the final round. If you're in the final three groups or so and you're putting that pressure on the leaderboard, how big a difference is it?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I don't think I could have put any more pressure on him than what I did. I posted that three hours before they were done. Lot of hard holes. That was an advantage I thought I had, but then when you get into a playoff waiting three hours, it turns into a little bit of a disadvantage. There's no excuse. I hit a bad shot and didn't deserve to win.  
  
  Q. Is it tougher getting to the playoff and losing as opposed to being two, three shots back?  
 J.B. HOLMES: Either way it's rough. Getting in the playoff, you got a chance to win, and playing bad doesn't make second quite as good. If the guy is really playing well and you put a good round to jump up to second, you feel pretty good. It's a little frustrating, but it happens. It's golf.  
  
  Q. What did you do specifically that lead to the bad shot on 18? What physically happened in that shot?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I hit it in the water left. I pulled it.  
  
  Q. You pulled it?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I hit a bad shot. Doesn't matter how it happened.  
 MARK WILLIAMS: When you holed the putt in regulation, did you have an inkling then it might stand up?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I thought I had a pretty good chance at the time. At the time I went back to -- Freddie was 12 and Paul was actually at 10. So I thought I had a pretty good chance maybe even to win outright. Then Paul made a couple great birdies and played great coming down at stretch and held on.  
 MARK WILLIAMS: Any more questions?  
  
  Q. What type of personality are you in terms of that one bad shot? You mentioned that several times. Obviously, that's what it was. Is that a shot that will stick with you a long time?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I'll forget about it by tomorrow. It happens. I've won playoffs and lost playoffs. It happens. I played great to get there. If I walk away with my head down after today's playing, I got problems. I played great, and just when it came down to it at the end -- earlier I made everything I needed to make to get into that spot. Hit a lot of great putts coming down the stretch and good shots. I made it easy on Paul right there on the first swing.  
  
  Q. Will you take a peek at the TV next week, or will you just try to get away and do other things?  
 J.B. HOLMES: It's frustrating how I missed it about three, four times seems like one spot. So just frustrating all around. It's my favorite Major. That hurts a little bit but, you know, I've had my chances and just didn't pull them off.  
  
  Q. Will you watch it on TV?  
 J.B. HOLMES: I might glance at it. I don't watch a whole lot of golf when I go home.  
 MARK WILLIAMS: J.B., we appreciate your time coming in. You're a class act with your time. All the best.  
 J.B. HOLMES: Thank you.
