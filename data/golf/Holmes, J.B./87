  Q. When you have a little time to look back on this one, how bad will it hurt?  
 J. B. HOLMES: I mean, it's golf. It happens. It happens every year to somebody. It hurts a little bit, but I'll get over it.  
  
  Q. If you had one shot to play over or sort of one five-minute stretch on that back nine, what would it be?  
 J. B. HOLMES: It would probably be my tee shot on 19. I hit it in the bunker there, and the wind was not enough to carry it. I hadn't hit a knock down driver all day. And my knock down went left, and it put me in a difficult spot.  
  
  Q. Is there something positive about what you can take out of today?  
 J. B. HOLMES: Not so much this day, but this week. I got to the Elite 8. I wasn't even in on Tuesday -- until Tuesday. So I'll take it as a good week.   
 Obviously I'm disappointed with the way it finished, but it happens.
