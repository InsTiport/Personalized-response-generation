 Q.   Was your putting the difference today?  
J.B. HOLMES:   I guess you can say that but I felt like I putted pretty good.   I hit a lot of putts right where I wanted to.   Just didn't go in.   It's just one of those days, Dustin played a great round.   I knew it was going to take a good round, even if I had a little bit of an offâ€‘die, it would take a good round to beat me and 69 out here is pretty freaking good today.   
He had a good round and I just didn't have any best day.   Like I said, I just couldn't get anything going and hit a lot of great putts.   Hit a lot of putts coming in I thought I made and just none of them went in.  
   
 Q.   What's your philosophy on looking at the leaderboard the last day?   
J.B. HOLMES:   I didn't really look at it that much.   I knew I just had to keep playing.   I would glance at it every now and then.   But you know, you add them up at the end and that's kind of what I was going for.   The last four or five holes, I was looking at it a little bit.   
But like I said, I didn't have any AGame today for sure but I felt like I hit a lot of great putts coming in.   I hit a lot of good shots coming in.   Unfortunately it just didn't enough.   
   
 Q.   How is Dustin viewed among you guys in terms of his talent and ability?   I think this is his ninth win now.   
J.B. HOLMES:   He's good, obviously.   If he's won nine times out here, you're pretty freaking good.   He played great today.   He hit a lot of good putts and stroked the ball really well, so it was a good day for him.
