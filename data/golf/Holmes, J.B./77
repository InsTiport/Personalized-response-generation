 Q.   The other event on the PGA TOUR this week.   It's really fun this week because the modified Stableford scoring system is back.   Instead of how low can you go, it's how high you can get ar the Reno‑Tahoe Open this week.   
And 22 points is the lead there, but J.B. Holmes had a terrific 17‑point day.   He has 18 points midway through the tournament, right now in fifth by himself.   He's with us from Reno.   
Congratulations.   A little strange talking about points in the game of golf, but it went awfully well for you in round two.   
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, it was a great day for me.   Started out good making some birdies and just kind of kept it going.   
It was a good day for me.   Before it got too hot, got to go out early and it was a really good round.  
   
 Q.   If I'm not mistaken, you didn't get on tour until after the tournament at Castle Pines was canceled.   This certainly rewards an aggressive player, and to me that seems to suit your golf game.   
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, I actually got to play Castle Pines once, and I really liked that my rookie year.   Very disappointed when they got rid of that tournament, so it was nice to see the system come back out and just do something a little bit differently.   We do the stroke‑play every week, and it's just nice to change it up a little bit.  
But, yeah, definitely rewards birdies, so you can be a little more aggressive out here and hit a few more pins.  
   
 Q.   Did you find it hard to follow the leaderboard in that case?  
J.B. HOLMES:   No.   I just can't look at it too much.   You just got to keep it going knowing that it's not strokes.   Somebody could be six spots back and make an eagle and all of a sudden they're right there.   A lot of stuff can happen, so you can't really look at it too much.  
   
 Q.   Almost a year ago you had surgery.   How are you feeling now and how is your golf game at this point?   
J.B. HOLMES:   Doing good.   I would say I'm pretty much back to 100% now.   Felt really good the last couple months and really haven't felt like anything has really hindered me or anything like that.   
I feel like I'm back.   I'm playing really well right now, so hopefully I can go out there and put up two more good rounds this weekend.  
   
 Q.   Has that crossed your mind at all?   You're putting it in the past, but it's 51 weeks later.   It was at the PGA Championship where you decided enough is enough.   Have you thought about that how far you've come in just a short year's time?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah, I sit down and think about it a little bit, but for the most part I'm just trying to get past it and get going and get better at golf.   But, yeah, when you sit down and think about, especially since it's coming around close to being about a year when I decided it, it's been in my head a little bit more lately than usual.  
Yeah, you sit down and think about it, and I'm just lucky to be out here and happy everything went well and the surgeries were good.   Just glad to be back out here.   
   
 Q.   Could you describe where you are now, the place in your life and with your career now as opposed to 51 weeks ago?   
J.B. HOLMES:   I mean, you know, a lot more comfort now than 51 weeks ago not really knowing was this going to be able to be cured, was this something I was going to have to play with, and if it was, it would be difficult for me to stay out here very much longer.   
So definitely thinking about career a little bit.   And a year later, you know, I'm hitting the ball really well, I'm playing good, and I feel like I have a great chance to win.   So it's a complete 180.   
   
 Q.   It's great to see and great to see you playing great golf again.   While there may be a win in Reno in your future, I understand there is a Hall of Fame induction in your future in Kentucky, right?  
J.B. HOLMES:   Yeah.   Yeah, I got the call from Mitch Barnhart a few weeks ago that I'm going to get inducted this year into the UK Hall of Fame.   That's an honor to be able to go back there.   So many great athletes have gone through that school, so it's a big honor.  
   
 Q.   Congratulations, J.B.   good luck the rest of the weekend.   
J.B. HOLMES:   All right.   Thank you.
