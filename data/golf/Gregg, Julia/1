 Q.  Match play is kind of a whole different beast.  How did it go out there today?  
JULIA GREGG: It went really well.  1st hole was a little rough but after that it got going.  It was nice.  She made a few bogeys and I just made pars to get 3-up, and then I kind of just held it together for the rest of the round.   
 Q.  How does this course suit your game?  
JULIA GREGG: It suits it really well.  It's a good driving course.  You can take advantage of some of the holes if you can get it up there, and then if you can hit a wedge close you can have a good look at birdie.   
 Q.  What's your experience in match play in the past?  
JULIA GREGG: Let's see, two years ago I made it -- I got cut at the round of 64, so it's really nice to make it past that.  This is the farthest I've ever made it.   
 Q.  What are you going do to celebrate your birthday?  
JULIA GREGG: Probably going go to dinner, and hopefully birthday cake.  Have fun.   
 Q.  In an ideal situation, 36 holes tomorrow.  How is your energy level and how will you kind of prepare?  
JULIA GREGG: I guess my energy level today is good.  Probably just go have an easy rest of the day and rest.  Go to bed early, wake up, and get ready to go tomorrow.
