 Q.  Nice round, great finish, four of the last five there birdied in.  What was going right today?  
RYAN YIP: Got a great tee time, conditions were perfect, the greens were in great shape, and just the putter got hot and hit some solid shots.   
This week I was struggling a little bit with my iron play, and luckily my short game saved me.  But today everything kind of clicked in the right direction.   
 Q.  Nice when you get that round and it feels that good and you can kind of just ride it?  
RYAN YIP: Yeah, absolutely.  I was just trying to make as many birdies as I could, because I know these guys are going to go low out there.   
 Q.  When you first went out, was it crazy like it was now?  
RYAN YIP: No, the wind didn't pick up really until maybe our 11th hole, like when we got down to the valley, that's when we started noticing the wind.  But the first ten holes were perfect.   
 Q.  What's it like doing this in your home country?  
RYAN YIP: I love being here.  This is a great event.  I've never played in one before, so I'm just relishing the moment, and hopefully I can play well tomorrow.   
 Q.  You've never been here or this is the first time you made the cut here?  
RYAN YIP: I've never played the Canadian Open before.
