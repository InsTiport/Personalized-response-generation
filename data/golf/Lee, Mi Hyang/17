 Q.   Talk about the course conditions.   Good scoring today, soft greens?  
MI HYANG LEE:   It's not, like more faster and they're more harder than practice round, so mine is pretty good, and they're faster.   
I played in the morning, so the course is pretty wet until No.14, but course condition is very good, and then I like the green speed, yes, it's better.  
   
 Q.   So the greens were not really slow then?  
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah, it's not really slow.   In the practice round it's really slow, but like much better.  
   
 Q.   But not much roll on the fairways, though, because they were wet?  
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah, right, but on the green it's a little firm, so a lot of bounce, when I hit a low iron.  
   
 Q.   You're near the top of the leaderboard.   How was your game overall?   Great putting.   
MI HYANG LEE:   I think my shot is good, but my putt is really great.  
   
 Q.   Putting?  
MI HYANG LEE:   Yes, putting.   Putting is best.   
   
 Q.   How have you played this year?   
MI HYANG LEE:   Much better than last year.   Last year I got 92 in the ranking, but now is 46, so much better, yeah.  
   
 Q.   What could this event do for you?  
MI HYANG LEE:   This event?   Just I like Canada.   Like when I'm young, I draw the Canadian flag when I was elementary school homework, I draw the Canadian picture.   I like Canada, so when I come to Canada, pretty good play always.  
   
 Q.   Why did you choose the Canadian flag?   You just liked it?  
MI HYANG LEE:   Just I want to come here to Canada one time when I was young, but yeah.   Just I like it.  
   
 Q.   Do you know how old you were when you first came to Canada?   Really young?  
MI HYANG LEE:   No, just two years ago, Waterloo.  
   
 Q.   Manulife?  
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah, Manulife, the tournament.  
   
 Q.   So you like this part of Canada then?  
MI HYANG LEE:   I think much better than Waterloo here.   Here is much better.
