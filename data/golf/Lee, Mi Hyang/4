Q. Did you know that last year when you shot 62 it was also St. Patrick's day?  Did you know that?
MI HYANG LEE: Really?
Q. I think it was Thursday last year.
MI HYANG LEE: I didn't know that.
Q. It was also St. Patrick's day.
MI HYANG LEE: Oh, okay.  I didn't know that.
Q. Do you think you were lucky?
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, actually I did today.  Yeah, just I missed the fairway but still good shot on the second one, so I made eagle on No. 15.
Yeah, I had a lot of luck today.  Yeah, for sure.
Q. What was working in particular?
MI HYANG LEE: Actually, I didn't make any birdie on par-5 yesterday, so today just I'm going to try the smart plan on par-5, and then I make one eagle and two birdies.  I think that that's more confident for me today.
Then actually my fade shot is pretty good work today, so just I think I have a lot of the comfortable on my shot and then my putts today.
Q. Eagle on 15?
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, my eagle.
Q. What was the progression?
MI HYANG LEE: I tried to draw the tee shot, but it wasn't, so it's go a little bit right and hit the cart path a little bit.
So my driver was I think 320 yards, and I think I played maybe this -- how can I say?
What is this?
Q. Gravel?
MI HYANG LEE: Gravel.  Just 190 to the pin but I shoot 5-iron, and then maybe two yard.
Q. So you hit it on the green in two?
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, hit on the green, two yard.
Q. You've had a couple good results here, this tournament, at this course.  What do you like about this place?
MI HYANG LEE: Just I love this golf course, and then just I feel just great.
Q. Comfortable here?
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, just everything is good.  Actually I'm staying with a host family.  They are Koreans, so I stay with them three years and they are so nice for me.
And then, yeah, so I think everything is good, just comfortable.  I shoot 10-under last year so I have a good memory of here.
Yeah, hope good luck for this weekend.
Q. Third year staying with them or fourth?
MI HYANG LEE: Third year.
Q. I think you went T13, T3, and now you're playing well again.
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, uh-huh.
Q. Are they out watching you today?
MI HYANG LEE: Yes.  Actually just I tee off 7:11 today, but they just came in the morning.  So they walked 18.
Q. Awesome.  The whole way?
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, and then they walked 18 yesterday, so that's pretty good.
Q. Wow.  Be out here again Saturday, Sunday?
MI HYANG LEE: They will go church, so if I play afternoon they can come.  If not they said no on Sunday.
