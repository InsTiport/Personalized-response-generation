 Q.  Another very good round and a good finish.  How big was that putt for you on 18?  
MI HYANG LEE: Just I want to make it, but not much pressure, not too much pressure.  So it doesn't matter (Indiscernible), but I made it, so I'm happy.   
 Q.  How long was that putt?  
MI HYANG LEE: Three yards, so nine feet.   
 Q.  We'll say ten, sounds good.  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes.   
 Q.  Did you feel nervous today at all or did you feel very comfortable?  
MI HYANG LEE: Actually, first hole the lay-up from bunker shot, so that felt a little bad, but just I wanted to keep going with my golf game.  So, yeah, that's fine.  I played with Morgan and she's pretty exciting to play with her, so, yeah, I'm comfortable.   
 Q.  Have you ever played with Morgan before?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, of course, she's nice.   
 Q.  You guys had fun?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes.  And then some par-5s we had to wait on the tee box so we did a little talking like that, so it's comfortable.   
 Q.  How did the rain affect you?  Were you prepared?  
MI HYANG LEE: It's a little hard, but like the rain coming or not a little, so, yeah, it's okay.   
 Q.  Did you have an umbrella, jacket?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, I have everything.  So that's better.   
 Q.  You dropped shots at the first two holes?  
MI HYANG LEE: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What did you do to come back?  
MI HYANG LEE: Just I want more concentration and then I want to just keep patient and stuff like that, trying to just keep my golf.   
 Q.  So it didn't worry you too much?  
MI HYANG LEE: I didn't worry, no.  Just first two holes.  I have another 16 holes today, so that's fine.   
 Q.  You think you'll be nervous tomorrow?  
MI HYANG LEE: I hope not.  Not nervous, just have fun tomorrow.   
 Q.  And this will be the first time you've led going into the final round ever in a major ever, ever?  
MI HYANG LEE: I think first time the last group in the final round.  Yeah, it's the first time ever.   
 Q.  First time in the final group on Sunday?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, uh-huh.   
 Q.  Do you think that will be fun?  Will you watch the leaderboard at all?  
MI HYANG LEE: Oh, excited, excited.   
 Q.  So there is a possibility that they might move up all the tee times tomorrow because of weather.  Does that please you that you won't have to figure out what to do?  
MI HYANG LEE: Doesn't matter, just playing.   
 Q.  Do you like that idea?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, that's better than rain.   
 Q.  And better than thinking about it for five hours?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, that's better.
