Q. Run me through the hole‑in‑one yesterday. 
MI HYANG LEE:   Just maybe 162 yards, and then I hit 6, and I thought just good line, so maybe I have a look, have a good birdie chance.   When my ball land, the ball little go left, but it go to the straight pin, the hole, and then just go in.   Nothing. 

Q.   What was the celebration like? 
MI HYANG LEE:   Just I'm jumping and then I hugged my caddie and then I'm loud, and then other players, oh, wow, amazing, like that, and then we got like high five, yeah, that's it.

Q.   Did you know the car was on the line?
MI HYANG LEE:   Oh, I didn't know that, but one player told me, oh, you get the car, like that.   Like see, you're next to the car.   Oh, yeah, the car is here, but I'm not sure‑‑ like No.17 have car, so I'm just‑‑ I want to make sure to ask after my first round and ask the LPGA can I get the car because I hole‑in‑one on No.17, and then they said, yes, they have a car.   Oh, okay, thank you so much.   I get the car. 

Q.   Have you ever won a car before?
MI HYANG LEE:   No, it's the first time.

Q.   First time?
MI HYANG LEE:   Uh‑huh, and then I got two times hole‑in‑one ever, and one is junior in Korea, and then one is yesterday.

Q.   So this is only your second hole‑in‑one?
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah, and then both hole‑in‑ones I hit a 6‑iron. 

Q.   What color car are you going to get? 
MI HYANG LEE:   What kind of car? 

Q.   What color car?
MI HYANG LEE:   Oh, I want black.

Q.   Black one?
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah.

Q.   Those cars are beautiful, right?
MI HYANG LEE:   Yes, it's perfect.   I love Kia.   I love a car in my home, it's a Sorrento, so my dad and me love Kia.

Q.   So you're going to give him the Sorrento, and you're going to take the K900?
MI HYANG LEE:   I think the K900 is too big for me, so I think I can take the Sorrento because I love SUV.

Q.   So your dad is going to get the K900?
MI HYANG LEE:   My dad told me just I want to buy K900 one day, but I got the hole‑in‑one.

Q.   So you might give it to him as a gift, huh?
MI HYANG LEE:   Yes.   Maybe Father's Day, like that, nice gift.

Q.   So don't tell him right now, just tell him later?
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah, so now I tell him, oh, that's my car, so please don't touch that one.

Q.   So you might not get a black one at all, you might get whatever color he wants?
MI HYANG LEE:   Well, he likes black, too. 

Q.   Pretty great round today, too, right?
MI HYANG LEE:   Yes.   I shoot 5‑under.   I have a lot of luck because I made the hole‑in‑one yesterday, so I think have a lot today, too. 

Q.   How has your time on Tour been since you won?   What has that changed since you won at Mizuno?
MI HYANG LEE:   After Mizuno I have a lot of confidence, so that's my‑‑ a little changed my golf.   I didn't change anything, but just my mind is a little bit changed, so more think positive and then more confident, so my golf is a little more great, I think, yeah. 

Q.   Mizuno was the only tournament of the year that was not on Golf Channel. 
MI HYANG LEE:   Yes, I know that. 

Q.   Were you sad about that?   It was such a crazy playoff you won. 
MI HYANG LEE:   Yes, but in Korea, a lot of people saw that one, and just, yeah, I played a five‑hole playoff, and then maybe a little raining, and then we got six tournaments in a row, and that tournament is the last one, so I think every player get tired.   So when I get in a playoff, I get nervous.   I have fun. 
And then when I make the birdie putt, like the last birdie putt for the win, just I thought, oh, now is the finish so I can go home because I'm so tired.   So I didn't do the ceremony for the win, so yeah.

Q.   Is that the craziest playoff you've ever been a part of?
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah, but just I played the playoff the first time ever.

Q.   That was your first playoff ever?
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah. 

Q.   What's your plan for this weekend to try to win here? 
MI HYANG LEE:   Just keep my‑‑ just be patient and then just keep playing my golf.   Yeah, that's it, just nothing.   I think I need to be patient for my golf, and then just keep playing. 

Q.   Is this the most memorable two days you've ever had at a tournament, most memorable first two days, first two rounds?   You're one back of the lead, you just won a car.   It seems like this has been a pretty good week so far. 
MI HYANG LEE:   Yeah, I think so, and I hope so. 

Q.   Juli Inkster is 54 and she's in the lead.   How crazy is that to you? 
MI HYANG LEE:   Oh, she's my favorite player because I want to be playing a long time like her, and then actually her daughter is older than me, so like she's amazing, and then a great player. 

Q.   Do you think you'll play golf until you're 54? 
MI HYANG LEE:   Hope so.
