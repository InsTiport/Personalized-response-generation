 Q.  Pretty about round, feel like you fought yourself back in there?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, yesterday I made a lot of pars, two birdies and one bogey.  And today's front nine, actually back nine, but I start the back.  So my front nine, I made like every par, so that means like I feel a little bad.  But the back nine, first hole, almost tap it in, almost eagle.  So that's a good start.   
Then the par 5, I'm trying to hit the second shot into the green.  That's good.  And then just my shots better than the front nine, so I think I shoot 5-under.   
 Q.  Is there more pressure on you to play well in Korea at home?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, a little bit, because this is my home course.  I'm living here, just ten minutes from here.  So in my off-season, I'm staying here, and there are some girls up here, graduated middle school here.  I lived here at 14 and still now.  This is my home course, and I have a lot of friends here.  My friends are coming and I think a lot of pressure for me.   
So every year, I play so bad here.   
 Q.  When did you first start playing here?  How old were you?  
MI HYANG LEE: Here?  13.   
 Q.  So it's been a long time playing here.  
MI HYANG LEE: The same as the first year as Sky 72.   
 Q.  So you started as soon as it was year?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes.   
 Q.  And why do you think you play bad here?  
MI HYANG LEE: Just I know well the golf course, but it didn't work.  Just it didn't work.  And then I did feel a lot of pressure for sure.   
 Q.  And this is where you live in the off-season, you live here in Incheon?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, ten minutes from here.   
 Q.  So you're driving to the course each day?  
MI HYANG LEE: No, I'm staying at the hotel.  Because when I stay at my home, I feel like it's not tournament.   
 Q.  So still staying in the hotel even though you're from year?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, I like it.
