 Q.  Ever played before when it was this dark?  
MI HYANG LEE: No, I don't think so.  I think first time.   
 Q.  How difficult was it finishing up there?  
MI HYANG LEE: I couldn't see the line or anything.  It was too hard.   
 Q.  But you had a good day otherwise?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Overall?  
MI HYANG LEE: Just I think last two event I just miss the cut.  My shot was worst.  But it's good for the one week off after the ANA.   
So I did good rest and then my body is much better than before.  Just I met my coach and maybe I fix my problem.   
So I think now I have a lot more confident than before.  So, yeah, I really like to play good today.  I got a lot of confident from today, yeah.   
 Q.  What did you work on?  Like what problems were you fixing?  
MI HYANG LEE: The rhythm and then confident, because I lose my confident a lot.  But I talked a lot with my mental coach about my confident.  I'm just too much worry about the result.   
So I didn't focus that.  Maybe just one shot the time.  So, yeah, I did fix that.   
 Q.  How difficult was it to stay loose during the rain delay?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, but actually we didn't hear anything on the 18th green.  The pooling rain the water, so the green is -- we couldn't play that, but nobody came to the green, so we just came off to the clubhouse, and then (indiscernible) is going there to check the green.   
I don't know.  If I'm kept playing, maybe just we don't need to play the dark.  That's hard, right?   
But it was good rest, and then I did keep better rhythm the back nine.   
 Q.  Was it important to finish today and start fresh tomorrow?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, for sure much better to finish.
