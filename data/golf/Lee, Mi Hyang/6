Q. Can you tell me what your approach was to today's game that might have been different from yesterday?
MI HYANG LEE: I think just less wind, and the greens more better condition.  So just everything is perfect game.  Just I missed a short putt last hole, but that's just one missed.  So that's fine.  Yeah, everything's good.
Q. And what do you think of the course in general?
MI HYANG LEE: Pretty wind this morning, like normally less wind in the morning.  But yeah, pretty good wind morning.  So I hit a pretty good shot.  I used a lot of wind today.  And a lot of behind wind on par-5s, so that's why I can hit the green almost around the green.  So I made birdie on par-5.  So I think that's a little different.
Q. And then going into tomorrow and the rest of the weekend, is your approach or mindset going to be any different?
MI HYANG LEE: No.  Just third round, so I have just two more rounds.  Just I want to play golf, just my golf.  That's it.
Q. And how is the course different from the courses in Korea?  Is the green different you would say?
MI HYANG LEE: Maybe more longer and more wide here.  And the greens are a little more faster than Korea.
