 Q.  Feel you had some good momentum going into today's round?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, just I did good rest because I finished 18 holes yesterday.  So comfortable.  So start a little not good, but it's getting better the back nine, so feel better.   
 Q.  Feel like you had better rhythm?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah, better rhythm and then more blow the winds more than yesterday, so feels a little harder than yesterday.   
So I missed a lot of green today, but my chips very better than before, better than yesterday.   
I missed 8 green but make 26 putts, so that's great.   
 Q.  Good to be in this position after two rounds going into Saturday?  
MI HYANG LEE: Uh-huh, hopefully it's good experience for me.  Uh-huh.   
 Q.  You count every round like that?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes.   
 Q.  During the round?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes.  I made two chip-in, so it was great, uh-huh.   
 Q.  Do you track other stats while you're playing?  
MI HYANG LEE: No, just for putt and then green in regulation.   
 Q.  Was it tough to be aggressive in the wind?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, because yesterday was little different wind.  I think today is just normal wind at this golf course.  Yesterday was a little different wind, so played easier to par-5; today is into the wind on the par-5s is a little harder than yesterday feels like.
