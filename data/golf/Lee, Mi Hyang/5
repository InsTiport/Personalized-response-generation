 Q.  How did you feel about your round today?  
MI HYANG LEE: I made a lot of birdies today.  I made six birdies and one eagle, but I didn't know that.  So just when I checked my score at the score tent, it was a little amazing for me.  And then everything is good, and then I think my chips better than maybe the last two days.  So maybe I make a lot of save par.  Yeah, that's better.  Everything's good.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Conditions a little calmer out there today than they were in rounds 1 and 2?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah.  I think greens is more faster and more harder last two days.  So tomorrow is more faster and harder.  I think so.   
 Q.  How do you like playing with Hyo Joo?  
MI HYANG LEE: Just I met her maybe 12, 13 years ago.  And then we played junior golf.  So we are friendly, so just have fun.  And I think we will play tomorrow again.  Her caddy said just keep fairway, just don't go into the fairway bunker.  That's too hard.  Yeah, we will play better tomorrow.  Yeah.   
 Q.  So you talked to her caddy too as well?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah.  Her caddy is Korean, so I can communicate with him.  And then he'll just really good friends with me.  So everything is friendly.   
 Q.  It's a very competitive field.  What do you have to do to stay ahead tomorrow?  
MI HYANG LEE: Nothing.  Just I want to play my golf.  That's it.  Just I want to think my golf, yeah.   
 Q.  You've been doing something that's working really well.  Your past two starts have been really good?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah.  First time I make bogey, so got a little nervous.  And hole number 17 I got a little way pushed it.  But I made the par.  So I got a lot of confidence from the chip shot.  I think my driver a little bad today, so I want to fix my driver first and then maybe keep doing my putts.  Maybe that's better.
