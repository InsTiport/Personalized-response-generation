 Q.  Describe your round and how you thought it went today.  MI HYANG LEE: Actually, my shot was pretty good this week, so I have a lot of confidence.  Two weeks ago when I played, my shot was terrible, so I go fix the last week.  So a lot of more confidence.  When I play today, just I have a lot of confidence.  So my shot perfect. I missed a lot of short putts today.  I made two bogeys today, and every bogey is a 3-putt.  My chip is good, my shot is good, but I have to practice for my putt.  Then that's better for playing the future, I think.   Q.  What makes these greens so difficult to putt on?  MI HYANG LEE: The greens were pretty good, just my problem, I think.   Q.  What do you think about the course in general?  MI HYANG LEE: It's pretty hard and then it's pretty long.  Everything is good, but it's pretty wet.  I thought today is lift and clean, but they didn't.  So sometimes a little grass is on my ball, so it's a little trouble.  Everything is good
