MI HYANG LEE: 62 is my lowest score.   
 Q.  What were you thinking on that front nine?  Were you getting nervous when you kept making birdie after birdie?  Were you thinking about anything?  
MI HYANG LEE: Actually, I think -- I thought it was a good start because first hole maybe almost tap in the birdie putt.  And then second hole I pushed my second shot, the par-5, 11 hole.  From there just a chip in and then eagle.  That's why I thought I just had a lot of luck today.  But I didn't think that I can shoot 9-under today.   
Just want to make birdie, maybe six holes.  I didn't hit maybe three spots my putt.  But still goes in.  So that's why I think a lot of luck today the front nine.  But it's not Back 9.   
 Q.  Did you ever think about a 59?  
MI HYANG LEE: No.   
 Q.  No?  Just playing?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yeah.  Actually, first nine I didn't know that I shoot 9-under.
