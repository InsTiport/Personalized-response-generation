 Q.  Zac, let's talk about today.  Really a solid day for you.  You have to be really, really happy.  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, whenever you go out there and make no bogeys, it's obviously nice, so it was a good day.   
 Q.  What was the best part because you were driving the ball in the fairway, hitting a lot of greens, which you have to do here.  What were you most proud of?  
ZAC BLAIR: I mean all of it really.  I hit a lot of fairways, like you said, and got the ball on the green, was able to make a few long putts.  So it was kind of just a pretty solid day all around.   
 Q.  Since I saw you last looks like you've gotten a little stronger in the shoulders.  Have you been working out in the off season?  
ZAC BLAIR: No, not much.   
 Q.  No?  So what is it?  Just good eating?  
ZAC BLAIR: A little hibernation fat probably.  Being stuck in the snow.   
 Q.  I got you.  Talk about what Andy does for you, a guy who's been on the bag for Johnny Miller and Tom Lehman.  How does he help you?  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah.  It's obviously a great team effort that we have.  It's obviously nice to have somebody that's won all over the place with a lot of No. 1 players in the world.  He's got a lot of on-course experience, kind of knows the right things to say, so it's obviously great.   
 Q.  So you really depend on him?  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, for sure.   
 Q.  What about the weekend?  What lies ahead for you this weekend, only two off the lead right now?  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, just go out and kind of do the same thing I did the first few days, get the ball in play and hit some greens and roll in a few putts.   
 Q.  Well, you sound very confident.  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah.  I've been playing well, so looking to carry it over the next few days, have some fun.   
 Q.  Keep it going.
