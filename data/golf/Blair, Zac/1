Q. Good day out there. Some comments about how it was.
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, played good. Made a couple putts kind of early in the round that kind of saved the round and then took care of the par-5s, birdied all four of those. Made a couple other good pars and a couple birdies -- chipped in on 2 which was nice. And, yeah whenever you go bogey-free it's always good.
Q. A bit of mixed results this year, you already have a top-10, how does it feel to just kind of be back?
ZAC BLAIR: It's obviously nice to be back playing out here, it's always good, so just kind of keep on keeping on, I guess, keep playing good and try and go have a few more good weeks.
Q. I know it's early but how do you keep the momentum going through the next three rounds?
ZAC BLAIR: I think kind of just avoiding bogeys, kind of like I did today is always nice. But, yeah, I mean, just kind of keep playing like I did today and it kind of takes care of itself.
Q. What was it about this course and these conditions that really suited you well?
ZAC BLAIR: It was pretty nice out there, it was perfect today, course was in really good shape. Drove it really well, made some good putts. But it's a little easier this week out here this week right now than it was in Hawaii last week, so it's nice.
Q. Going into the next couple rounds being where you are what is the mindset going in? It's a pretty good feeling, right?
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, for sure. A few more rounds to go, but just got to keep playing well. This is the kind of a tournament where you got to go low every round basically, so it's not like you go out and shoot 8-under and feel like you can kind of coast in, you got to keep playing well. So that's always nice and, yeah, just keep doing the same things.
