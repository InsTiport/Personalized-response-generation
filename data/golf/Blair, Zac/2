Q. Let's talk about the finish for you.  Yesterday four straight birdies, today a couple birdies.  You like the end of the day.
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, it's always nice to finish the day like that, couple of putts went in.  It's always nice.
Q. Talk about the putting, because I've watched you out here for the last couple years.  Seems to be in good order right now.
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah.  Worked a little bit at Honda with some people the last couple of days and obviously nice when they're going in.
Q. Have you changed anything?  Because I know you were a little fidgety when I saw you in Hawaii.  Looks like you're a little quicker in pulling the trigger.
ZAC BLAIR: That was kind of one of the things I was spending way too much time over the ball and talking to a couple people, working on some things.
Q. It is working out.  What is it like playing with Sung so far for two days?  Man, he's playing lights out.
ZAC BLAIR: For sure.  Anytime you see somebody making all those putts and hitting all those good shots, it's fun to be part of it.  Hopefully we can both keep it up the next couple of days.
Q. You excited about the weekend?
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, for sure.  Good opportunity to go play another good golf course and try and play good.
