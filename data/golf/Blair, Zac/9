 Q.  10-under par, moves you up to number 33.  You came in at 106.  Got to be pretty excited about that.  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, kind of my goal.  My first goal was to make the Playoffs.  Obviously the next one was to keep moving on, get all the way to that last one.   
It obviously helps to have a good week like this.  It was nice.   
 Q.  Look back a year where you were at the Web.Com Tour Championship.  You finished second, get your TOUR card.  It's kind of been a whirlwind since then, hasn't it?  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, it's been a crazy 12 months, a lot of golf.  Been to a lot of cool places.  It's been a really cool experience.   
 Q.  Were you thinking about any of this out there today or were you just out there playing golf?  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, you know, obviously coming in at 106, I knew I had to play well.  But I put myself into a pretty good position over the first few days.  Just kind of wanted to do the same thing I did those first few days:  play well, keep the ball in play, make a few putts.
