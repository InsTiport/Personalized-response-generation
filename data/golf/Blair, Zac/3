 Q.  Strong finish for you.  Especially that par on your last hole.  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, it is always good to get that first round out of the way, especially with the conditions we had, those first 18 holes were pretty tough.   
 Q.  You had a long wait because of fog on that 18 tee as well.  No warm ups, it didn't bother you?  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, I think we were out there probably close to 45 minutes, so it was pretty tough.  But just got to deal with those things sometimes.  Happy to make par there on 18.   
 Q.  You're a professional golfer, you have to deal with things all the time, but this week trying everyone's patience between the rain, the soggy fairways and the fog, all just part of being a professional touring golfer?  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, for sure.  Everyone's got to deal with it out here and hopefully you get lucky with the draw and it looks like we got a pretty good break playing Spyglass the first day.   
 Q.  Tell me about Pebble Beach and your round coming up this afternoon?  
ZAC BLAIR: Yeah, kind of got to go out there and keep playing good and hopefully get a break with the weather.  It doesn't look like it's supposed to rain too much, so we'll see what happens.
