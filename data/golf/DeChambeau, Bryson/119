 Q.  5-under today, so far leading the way in strokes gained putting here on Friday.  Is that part of your game that you're feeling the most comfortable with?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Absolutely.  My wedges are struggling a little bit right now, I'm getting some weird spin rates, so we're going to go work on that.  Don't know why, honestly, it's just a weird thing that has been plaguing me a little bit.  But I'm making great swings, it's just the ball's not coming out in the right little box.  So it is what it is.   
But putting, fantastic, making a lot of great putts and unfortunately didn't get one on the last, but I'm still happy with 5-under.   
 Q.  A little hype around you today, this week, really.  Playing with Tiger, playing well coming into this event, did you feel that, how do you navigate that?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: No, I've been playing great golf, honestly, I don't really worry about that.  It's great to play with Tiger, great to get some good experience from him, honestly, he knows a lot, obviously.  And it's just great to get out here and play some good golf.  This is my first time here, so shooting 2-under, 5-under is pretty nice, to be able to still be in contention for the weekend.
