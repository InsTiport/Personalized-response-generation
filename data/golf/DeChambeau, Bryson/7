Q. How do you feel about your play through the first 36? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Not good, to say the least. I was feeling something a little weird lastââ two nights ago, and I came out yesterday and was fine for the most part. As I kept going through the round, I started getting a little dizzy. I don't know what was going on, a little something weird. 
So I got checked for COVID last night, and I was fine, nothing. But I had to do the right thing and make sure there was nothing more serious than that. I don't know what it is or what happened, but these past couple days, I've felt really, really odd and just not a hundred percent. Some of that's played into it. I just feel kind of dull and numb out there, just not fully aware of everything, and making some silly, silly mistakes for sure. 

Q. Go back to yesterday, when your ball couldn't be found. Did that shake you, or were you able to rebound? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I mean, definitely throws you for a loop when the guy goes and gives you the ball on the 4th tee box. Oh, I found it. You know, I struggle whenever we know it's in that area and it's all wet and it's a plugged lie, guaranteed. And they don't give youââ they have to say it's within a couple foot area. I'm like, well, I know it's in this area that's plugged, so I would think I would get some relief, but clearly not. The three minutes was up, so I took a penalty and went back to the tee box and proceeded to hit in the same spot and had a really bad lie after that. 
So it just seems like there's a lot of things going not in the right way. I've certainly played worst golf than this and won golf tournaments. So, you know, it's one of those things where it's golf. You can't control everything as much as you try.

Q. Was it Thursday night you began to feel something or Wednesday? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Thursday night.

Q. Just that night you began feeling dizziness? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, every time I'd bend over and come back up, I'd like lose my stance a little bit. So I don't know what's going on. I've got to go and do some blood work and get checked out and figure out what's going on for this offâseason.

Q. Are you feeling the same thing this morning? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, I'm not good, unfortunately. But it is what it is. I don't know what it is. There's like something in my stomach that's just not doing well.

Q. A bad finish. What was going on those last two holes? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Hit a bad drive on 17. Had a gap, but I thought I could draw, and it came out and went right and flew forever. Same thing happened on 18 with my iron shot. It just flew forever. Man, I don't know what it is. 
I hit a great little chip shot too, and I didn't think it would break left and go down the hill. I thought it was actually going to go to the right. 
A couple of misjudgments with the wet ground and everything. Again, wet ground and water has always been my nemesis for some reason, just can't figure it out, whereas some people have no problem with it. They're able to hit it and have no issues. 
Something I've got to work on this offâseason. I've got to figure out some golf ball stuff. I felt like I was swinging my irons pretty well. Driver was not well. I just, again, felt dull and numb out there. I don't know what else to say.

Q. The test was negative? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It was negative, yes. I had to do my due diligence. I made sure everybody on my team was negative as well, and they confirmed that. So it wasn't that. It's no respiratory anything. It's more of just very dizzy, and I've got a pain in my stomach, so I don't know. Just some weird stuff going on.

Q. Have you had this before? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: No, it's the first time. I'll go figure it out, just like anything. I'm more concerned for the health ofââ the way I'm going about that. Golf is golf. You're going to have stuff go on, but I want to fix my body. You know me. Last time I had back issues, I went and fixed that, and I haven't really had any body issues since, until now internal. So I've got to go fix that.
