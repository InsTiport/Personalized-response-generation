 Q. I wanted to ask you about the second hole, the bounce back. You had that birdie, after the mishap on 1. How important was it at least early on to settle things?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Oh, it was great. It was good. I misclubbed all day. That's ultimately why I didn't execute. There were three or four places out there where I just‑‑ missed a 6‑footer on 7. I missed a 6‑footer on 8. I made a 6‑footer on 10. 12 I made a bogey‑‑ excuse me, no, 13 I'm making bogey. 15 I'm making double. And then 18 I'm making double. I mean that's six or seven shots right there.  
   
 Q. How much of that is these tough scoring conditions, and are they the toughest scoring conditions you've played in in your entire career?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: No, just didn't execute. I'd say Olympia Fields was right up there and I was able to shoot 4‑ or 5‑under every single day.   
   
 Q. You had bounce back holes on the back nine, too, with the birdies after the bad holes. How important was that to keep your momentum?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Kept going. And I hit a good drive on 17 in the right rough barely. And hit a great shot on there, and barely missed a putt.  
And then unfortunately did the same thing on 18. I pulled the drive in that bunker and got it out there and made a good bunker shot up there. And I wasted so many shots in putting that it's sickening.   
   
 Q. There's some new guys out here and a lot of guys that you've influenced and had a great following. What do you make of this aspect of this week?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's fun having them around to support me. I love it. It's great. It gets my mind off of some things, but at the end of the day I still shot 5‑over today, which is pretty pathetic.
