Q. Bryson, how would you assess your 7-under par round today?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Obviously, 7 under is never a bad thing. I felt like it could have been 10 out there. Time goes on. We'll see how all this plays out, but for me -- sorry, I'm laughing about something else.
No, look, 7 under is always a great score. I'm happy to be able to do it. I made the putts when I was able to make them, a couple key clutch ones on 17, 15, 14.
I didn't feel like I rolled it that bad, just some of the putts just weren't going on my starting line the way it should have been. I really have to focus on that this afternoon. Hopefully, that plays into the weekend for me.
Q. If there's one key for you this weekend, what is it?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's putting. If I can get my putting a little bit better and I can roll putts on my line and I'm a little bit more confident with that, I feel like everything will fall into place.
