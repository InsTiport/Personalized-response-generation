 Q.  Bryson, 4-under 66 today, tied for third as it stands right now. If we can just get an opening comment on your round.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, I mean, I had a good run late coming in, and unfortunately got hosed on 17, caught a jumper out of the first cut and was not expecting that and flew it too far, then a little chip shot, muffed it, just didn't come out very good. Hit a good putt and barely missed it, and then hit a good drive, got lucky on the lie, hit a good shot up there into 18, thought I made the putt and it just broke at the end, unfortunately. That was kind of my day.   
Felt like it could have gone either way. Yesterday never should have happened. If I make the putts like I should have, I was minus two strokes short game and putting, but it was just normal there. Had I putted pretty well I would have won by a lot this week.   
 Q.  Could you just talk about getting back into contention after a three-month break and what that was like for you, especially with this atmosphere?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, it was weird, especially not having played any tournament golf or anything in this off break and really didn't play for anything, either. So for me it was a little uncomfortable at times, but again, I got comfortable with it. I just didn't get the job done again. My time is coming.   
 Q.  As far as your distances off the tee, could you just let us know your average driving distance in still conditions a year ago on your own calculations compared to what it is now?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Well, yesterday whatever the PGA TOUR average was -- I was flying it probably 295 to 300 and now I'm flying it over -- like with no wind or anything, probably around 325, 330 very easily.   
 Q.  You talked about your shirt size changing; did your hat size change?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: No, my hair -- no, it didn't. My hat size didn't change. There's not very many muscles up here that I can train around the brain. But no, that's pretty much stayed the same. It is what it is.
