 Q.  11-under total, how would you reflect on your week?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Very frustrated.  Quite honestly my wedges were surprisingly off quite far.  We couldn't figure it out all week and that's really what cost me this week.  Again, I wasn't hitting it my absolute best.  Not as good as Sunday last week, but got a little bit better here and there and was able to manage my game really well and play well today.  I didn't necessarily hit it good but played well.   
 Q.  Overall, your trip to The European Tour and a victory, how good of a platform to build on?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's a great platform to build on.  I know that I'm right there and know that I can play anywhere in the world now in any conditions.  Albeit this week was a little different with the wedges, I think that I can play anywhere now.
