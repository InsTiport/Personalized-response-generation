BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I didn't feel like I was hitting it my best, anywhere near my best.  I was able to recover in a couple situations, made a couple long putts, 5, and then got up-and-down on 6, which was huge.  I even missed a couple putts.  I just felt like it was a scrappy round, but I got it out and shot 66 today, so happy.
Q. What is the mindset when you're not feeling your best because to us it looked pretty good.  You hit a lot of irons down the flag, but what is the mindset when you're in that state thinking I need to shoot a low score but I'm not feeling hot?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It was mainly off the tee that I wasn't comfortable, and so in that case, I'm trying to be a little more conservative off the tee, making sure I can get it somewhere in a spot where it's okay, and then when I do have the opportunity to go for it, flag it.  My irons are fine.  I just need to go work on my 3-wood and driver, but I am headed to the driving range.
Q. We're just getting used to watching people putt with the pin in.  You're one of the guys that did.  Can you give us insight into why you came to that conclusion and how you came to that conclusion?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Well, there's a little bit of testing behind it, but usually if I'm hitting it two to three feet by, that's never really going to hurt, but four feet to five feet by, it could bounce off.
Q. How much testing have you done of the different sorts of pins because we heard you were doing that?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, not much.  I've only done stuff on the PGA Tour right now, but I'm testing stuff obviously on the European Tour.  Today it helped quite a bit.
Q. You've said you want to get a better understanding of this game than anyone has ever had in the past.  Just elaborate on that for us a little bit.
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I want to be able to go out on the golf course and not really, oh, it feels a little different today or something is a little different, I don't know what it is and you can't understand it.  That's not me.  I want to be able to go, oh, it's because of this and this and be able to calibrate for it and ultimately perform because of those unique and different conditions.  So that's what I mean.  I'm trying to figure out different conditions, different atmospheres, different temperatures, different soil types, different firmness values of greens.  Just everything, trying to understand as much as I possibly can so I can be consistent.
Q. How far along that journey are you?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Probably have a good 50 to 60 per cent probably done.  And that last 40 per cent is a lot.
Q. You must be very happy with the score.  What's your verdict on the round?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Scrappy, a little scrappy.  I've got to clean up some iron shots.  I hit some driver shots, 3-wood shots.  Just didn't seem like I had it today.  I was feeling pretty good on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday wasn't great, and came out today a little scrappy and was able to get it around in 66 thankfully.
Q. When you sign for a 6-under par round and you're not happy with necessarily how you played, that must --
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I played good.  I got it around.  I got it around and performed and got it in the hole when I needed to.
Q. I know that you're being asked this all the time, but new viewers are seeing it all the time.  There you are, you're putting with the flag in, you've got this scientific approach.  How far down the road are you in terms of your scientific process of the game of golf?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: From my knowledge of what I have about the game of golf right now, I think we've accounted for probably half of everything.  We've still got a long way to go.  Obviously there are things that ultimately I will never be able to control, which is wind, but if we can create an air tolerance that's good enough, then obviously that'll be better than most out here.  So we've still got a long way to go.
Q. And it's definitely advantageous to putt with the flag in?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I would say so, if you're hitting it two to three feet by.  If you hit it any harder than that, you're asking for it to bounce off.
