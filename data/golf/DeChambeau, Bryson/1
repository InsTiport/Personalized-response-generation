Q. Ideal scoring conditions out there this morning.  Certainly took advantage.  How pleased with 5-under par 65?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   Definitely very pleased.  I was driving it a bit all over the place for the most part out there.  Hit some good drives to 6 and 7.  But was definitely struggling with the driver and a little bit of the irons, and I have to clean that up for tomorrow.  If I can do that and put the way I did today, I'll certainly be pleased.
Q. A lot of talk about the distance and the advantage it gives you, but how important is your short game a reflection of your score today?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   Huge.  Getting up-and-down on 7, on 4, didn't do it on 3, but hit a good wedge on 2, unbelievable bunker shot out of the desert on 1.
Time and time again really, really great wedge shots around the greens and a lot of nicely struck putts.
Q. What do you now build on for the rest of the week?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   I know that I'm putting well.  I know that I can hit it far out here.  I'm disappointed it's not as far as I would like it but once I got out there and was hitting some wayward shots, you have to try to rein it in and control it better.
I was able to do that for the most part and miss it in the right places and hopefully I miss it in the right places when I do hit it off-line.
Q. What are the ideal conditions to hit it as far as you like, temperature?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   This is about right.  It's just more of my body isn't feeling 100 per cent from the travel over, and not like I thought it would.  I had a lot of things to do these past couple nights.  So I haven't been able to work out the way I wanted to.  I got a speed training session in yesterday but wasn't enough to get my speeds over 200 and be comfortable with it.  Once you start hitting it wayward my brain just kind of retracts to not wanting to swing as fast.  I could hit it really far, hit it over 200, but it could go anywhere.
Q. Obviously you want to protect your body.
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   That, but it's more ball speed.  I've got it to 217.  Hopefully over 200 for sure.
