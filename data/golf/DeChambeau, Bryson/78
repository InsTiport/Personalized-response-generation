Q. Saw you go to the putting green last night and put the work in.
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, I was working until 7:15, 7:20.  Dark.  Yeah, we had lights out there.  I wasn't going to leave until I figured it out.  That's just me.  You guys know that.
Q. You have improved every day in your putting.  When you see incremental games like that, how rewarding is it?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, it's good.  It means we're going in the right direction.  It's just frustrating that it didn't happen Thursday.  I want to understand why that's happening, and if that happens, watch out.
Every week I feel like I can be right up there close to the lead now.  Where all the math and all the stuff, all the adjustments that we're making, I really believe that it can hopefully only get better.  If I keep healthy.  If I keep healthy.
Q. What were you working on last night in terms of the stroke?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Well my face angle at impact with putting was not online at all.  I mean, it was like a blackout.  I had no idea where I was starting.  So I tried to figure it out last night, and it took me about an hour and a half before I finally recognized what it was.  Took me too long to figure it out, but I did.
Q. That's a high-speed camera you use, right?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, 720.
Q. So gives you an idea exactly at impact...
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: What's happening on launch, but it was more of stroke and consistency as a face angle.  That's a very difficult question to answer.  It's not like you can change loft and, oh, it's perfect.  You have to figure out what helps create that consistency of the starting line.  That's a body mechanics things.  I can figure it out.  I mean, I know a little bit about it.
Q. Never doubted you.
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Thanks.  Sometimes.  I missed on the last hole.  I couldn't see the line.  And then it gets down to like an optics thing.  Like my eyes just sometimes -- I just can't see straight lines.  It's really weird.  Sometimes they curve.
Q. We made a big deal about you putting with the flag stick in, but there have been players who said this week that they actually like the optics of putting at an object above the ground.
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, it gives them perspective of where a hole is.  Like instead of you looking down over a putt you don't really know where the hole is, you can see a flag stick and gives them a perspective of where to hit it.
So, yeah.
Q. What do you think about this course?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, I like it.  It's a good test of golf.  Interesting test of golf.  Last time I was here totally different game, mentality.  You know, I think coming into this week playing well last week, if I would've just ball-striked it a little bit better it would've been fine.  Clearly that wasn't the case.
But I like the golf course in general.  It reminds me of my home courses, or one of my home courses back in Fresno.  Belmont Country Club:  short, tight.
Q. You said you're a different player than last time.  Aren't you kind of by definition a different player every round?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I guess so.  I mean, every week, yeah, you're right.  Look, for me at the end of the day, again, I'm trying to simplify it as much as -- with as much stuff as I do, I'm still trying to simplify the game.
People go around and just feel it around the golf course.  I was asking couple people in the locker room.  What did you hit on this hole last week?  Just hit it like a half 7-iron.  Kind of felt -- I'm just like thanks.  Appreciate it.  I have no idea what that means.  Means nothing to me.
For me, I'm just trying to quantify it to where we can make proper adjustments now.  It's literally about adjustments and flighting it properly with the proper spin.  If I can do that and we understand that, it's a different league.
