 Q.  Bryson, solid back-to-back weeks. What have you learned in these first two weeks back?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: That on short courses I can still play good, even with my added length. It's nice to have my iron play be pretty topnotch. Even though I couldn't use my length to my advantage this week, I was able to take care of some business and gave myself a chance at the title. The putts just didn't fall this week. I was really struggling on the greens with that.   
Next week we're going to figure out a better game plan for our putting and make sure I'm starting on my line and more comfortable next week.   
 Q.  Last two weeks have been a unique brand of golf on TOUR with these two golf courses. Did you enjoy that?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's good to try and learn how to adapt. This style golf course, albeit I love it, it doesn't fit my game. It's amazing I can still adapt and lower my ball speed and still have the same control and control my irons and make decent amount of strokes and still get the ball to go in the hole.   
If you want to be the No. 1 player in the world, you've got to learn how to adapt, and I think that's what I'm starting to learn.   
 Q.  What was it about your putting this week?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I don't know. I felt like every time I tried to make a great stroke, it would come off weird off the face, and that makes me uncomfortable. I feel like I'm seeing it great. I feel like I'm hitting the lines. The grain this week just moved the ball left and right, and I just wasn't confident with the line, and it came off weird every once in a while.   
It's a bit of launch, and it's a bit of reading the grain combined with the slope.
