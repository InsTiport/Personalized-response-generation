Q. Bryson, not off to a great start but came back very, very well.  How proud are you of how you went today and finished?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, it was a bit frustrating out there in the beginning.  The greens were a little slow, a little bumpy in the afternoon.  Then the wind picked up, and that made it really difficult out there.  You know, I just kept fighting, wasn't hitting my irons exactly the way I wanted to, wedging it awful, but it was just exposing something that I need to work on, so I'm going to go work on that this afternoon, but really proud that I fought back and was able to finish 2-under today.
Q. To win the championship and go so deep as you did last week in the Dubai Desert Classic in 24-under and to come here and go back into it again, how difficult is that?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's very difficult.  You know, I'm a little tired, fatigued, body is definitely fatigued, physically and mentally, especially after a good win last week.  I think that there's a lot of adjustments to be made relative to last week.  The greens are a little slower, wind is up, just the turf is a little different.  So trying to adjust for that after winning, it's difficult.  But it's a good challenge that I think we can reconcile after the next couple days.
Q. As the golf course is playing slow, the greens are running at 10.3, you're used to 13 on the stimp week in and week out.  We've got a golf course that's drying out, so the golf course is going to be quicker and get quicker as you're accustomed to.  Will you welcome that?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Absolutely.  I like things getting faster, firmer.  I'm comfortable with that.  I'm able to perform in those conditions because we've measured them and we know what happens in those conditions, so hopefully that'll work to my advantage.
