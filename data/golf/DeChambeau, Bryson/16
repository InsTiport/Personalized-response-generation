  Q. 66, you finish this tournament 20-under par and after a bit of a break are you going to leave the island of Maui satisfied?
 BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   I wouldn't say fully satisfied.  I was coming here to win and I don't think I'm going to get that done today.  But I learned a lot about my game, my speed and what I have to do to keep it in the fairway and to make sure I give myself some opportunities and just my putting was rusty this week, unfortunately, and that's something that we have to learn how to adapt better to and different green situations, it's nobody else's fault but my own, and I just have to figure out how to manage that a little better and as time goes on I think we will, but I've been super focused on hitting it far, which I've accomplished, and I'm going to keep trying to do that, but if I can get the putting tidied up a little bit it would have been a different story this week.
 Q. You're still waiting to decide your next event, but until then do you think the challenge that you (wind noise) and secondly, you talked about a 48-inch driver prior to the Masters, is that still a possibility out here in the near future on the PGA TOUR?
 BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   Absolutely.  The 48-inch driver is always an opportunity.  It depends on the golf course.  It's got to be a golf course that's a little more wide open.  I could be over 200 right now with that driver, but -- I could have done it out here this week, again there's a lot of runouts that just wouldn't have fit this golf course, unfortunately, it would take it too far.
 15, I would have flown it through the fairway.
 18, it runs out, there's like a gully.  It's just, it didn't really fit the model.
 And then the items that I presented myself aren't going to be as difficult as I think they are, I just got to get after it and focus and work hard.
