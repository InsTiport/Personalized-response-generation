 Q.  I know you really wanted that point, and you struggled really hard.  First of all, about the day and the way you finished on your first Ryder Cup?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, I played good today, and unfortunately things didn't go my way.  I shot 4-under, he shot 5-under.  It is what it is.  He made incredible eagle, and I did what I had to do and missed a couple opportunities.   
But other than that, I played some great golf.  And when it comes two years down the road, I think things will be a different.   
 Q.  Anything surprise you about the atmosphere?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: No.  I was expecting all of it.  I was ready for it.  I enjoyed my time thoroughly and couldn't be more honoured to represent the United States.
