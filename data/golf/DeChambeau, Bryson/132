Q. Talk about what it means to have him here following you around?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Well, look, he hasn't seen a golf tournament since the U.S. Amateur. And he was flown out for that only for a day to watch the match. And before that he hasn't been able to see me play, quite honestly, at all, through college or nothing.
But for him to be here for this moment, it's special. And it chokes me up. 

Q. Is it fair to say that even with what you accomplished, youre slightly disappointed because you wanted to come in here and win?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Well, on a real note, yes, absolutely. I mean there's obviously that desire to play with the best and ultimately perform at the highest level. Unfortunately there were a few things that I need to do a little bit better to take care of on my end, on our end, excuse me. And if we can do that, I think I'll be right back in the thick of things. I've just got to keep placing myself there. 
This happens at every level for me, I think. It happened at junior golf, amateur golf, collegiate golf, and it's just going to keep getting to better and better levels.

Q. Well see you next week at Harbour Town. Have you been able to play that course and what are your expectations?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I love that golf course. I played it once. I think it personally fits me quite well. I'm a straight driver and like to hit a lot of low shots and control my golf ball. Definitely a ball‑striker's golf course. And I look forward to making my professional debut there. 

Q. You have the Triple Crown of amateur titles, the MCA, the U.S. Amateur and now this. What does that mean to you?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I can't even begin to describe what it means to me. Again, words cannot describe what I've done. I can't think of it yet. All I can say is that I'm extremely honored. It's a lot of hard work and accumulation from everyone on this team. Again, it's not just me, it's everybody that's working with me, to make me who I am today. Certainly without my family and my friends and my wise council, there's no way I could be here right now. 

Q. There was a long receiving line you went through, what were the emotions?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Joy, love. That's the main thing. I knew no matter what happened today they would still love me. It's cool to share that experience with them, being the low amateur.
