 Q.  Yesterday you told us you weren't feeling well, today you don't look any better.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: No, I'm worse today. I couldn't hear anything out of my right ear until number 13 it finally popped and that was helpful a little bit, but, boy, was it a struggle out there for me on the greens today. That's okay, I'm going to go work on it a little bit. I didn't feel like I was putting bad it just seemed like putts were going weird ways and ways they shouldn't. But I'm going to work on that and hopefully have that ready to go for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Overall your thoughts on the round, six birdies and four bogeys, so a mixed up-and-down day?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, I made I think it was four bogeys with wedges in my hand, so all of them were wedges. If I can clear that up and keep attacking the par-3s and par-5s like I am, I'll be right up there hopefully come back nine.   
 Q.  Going into the final round two shots behind, forecast for winds of up to 25 miles an hour, does that help or hinder when you're chasing?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Let's bring it. I love it.   
 Q.  What about the thoughts on defending a title for the first time. You won here obviously last year and it would be a successful defense for the first time in your career. How excited are you about that?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: It would be incredible. Being under the weather and fighting through some of the stuff that happened last week and persevering this week would be a tremendous honor.   
 Q.  Third round 70, 2-under, six birdies on the course, I know you won't be content with how it finished today, how would you assess today's performance?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I just messed up a couple wedge shots today. It was with my pitching wedge and I just felt like they don't come off properly and they flew a little too far, some weird stuff that was going on out there that I couldn't understand. But that's okay, we're going to regroup and try and understand what happened out there and see what could have possibly happened and hit some shots on the range and do a little bit of putting work and get that all ironed out for tomorrow.   
 Q.  We know you'll be very eager to defend your title and you'll probably be the last guy on the range as we often see. Know you're not feeling a hundred percent at the moment, how much is that a factor at the moment?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I'm actually hitting it surprisingly really, really well right now. I figured something out last night and I implemented it today and it worked beautifully, it was just a couple distance control things that kind of threw me off. So I'm going to go work on that, work on some putting, speed control, speed control was not good today and got to make sure that's taut tomorrow.
