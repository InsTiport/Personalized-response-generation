  Q. Let's please welcome in the CEO of the USGA, Mike Davis.
 MIKE DAVIS:   Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  It's now my distinct honor to introduce the President of the United States Golf Association, Stu Francis.
 STU FRANCIS:   Thank you, Mike.  We are so proud to have hosted this championship at Winged Foot during this tumultuous time in our nation's history, and while we couldn't have fans here, we appreciate all of the energy and support from afar.
 We'd like to thank the leadership, the staff and the committee members here at Winged Foot.  Early mornings and late nights were spent making sure every detail was taken care of, including the golf course, which was in spectacular condition.
 This year's U.S. Open included 13 amateurs in the field.  With a score of 298, the silver medal for low amateur goes to John Pak of Scotch Plains, New Jersey.  John, congratulations.
 Now it is my honor to welcome the champion of the 120th United States Open.  With a score of 274, the Jack Nicklaus Gold Medal for the winner of the 120th U.S. Open goes to Bryson DeChambeau of Clovis, California.
 Bryson, we are thrilled to present the historic U.S. Open trophy given to every champion since 1895.  You may now raise the U.S. Open trophy.
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   (Raises trophy to rounds of applause.)
 Q. You were a top-10 player in the world coming into this season, yet you still went through a massive physical transformation for moments like these.  Take us back to when it first started and take us back to what made you think that you needed to do that in order to stand here with that trophy.
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   Well, I'd be remiss to not speak about my sponsors and the people that have affected me to make this all possible.  I can't remember every single one of them, but I want to say this first:  Thanks to CPG, Cobra Puma Golf, Bridgestone, you've got HD Golf, Bentley, S&P, a bunch of people, Rolex, Veritext.  They've all been supporting me through tough times, through good times.  They've been incredible for me.
 I also want to thank my whole team over there, Connor, Brett, Tim, Mike Schy and Chris Como.  Chris has been here for I'd say about -- how long, three, four years.  I've known him for seven years.  And to be honest with you, he has done so many great things for me this past year, going through this body transformation, changing my whole golf swing, inspiring me to hit it farther, as far as I can, and he ultimately has allowed me to have the confidence to go forward with that thought process, go forward and attack it and not be fearful of it and try and gain speed and try and press the status quo.  So I'd be remiss to not say thank you for everything you've done, Chris.  It's been an amazing journey, and to many more for sure.
 John, thank you.  You did a great job this week, and also want to say thank you for inspiring me.  I remember being an amateur playing in a U.S. Open.  And you came up to me, what was it, Wednesday -- Tuesday, I think, one of those days, and you asked me a couple questions, and I thought that was pretty special.  I knew at that moment you were a pretty bright individual and you've got a great future ahead of you.  Keep going at it and you'll be just fine for sure.
 Q. Speaking of being an amateur, only two players before today had ever won an NCAA individual title, a U.S. Amateur title and a U.S. Open:  Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.  What does it mean to you and what do you think about when you hear your name joining that exclusive company?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   It's just an honor.  I don't know what else to say.  It's been a lot of hard work.  Mr. Nicklaus has been always awesome to me.  He gave me a sponsor's invite.  Tiger has always been great to me.  I can't say thank you enough to them for them helping me push me along to be a better person and a better golfer, as well.  But to be in the likes of the names of that company is special.  I'll forever appreciate that.
 Q. You've wanted to stand here with that trophy next to you and kissing it like you just did your entire life.  How does the reality compare to the dream?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   You know, it's kind of interesting, on 9 is when I first thought, okay, this could be reality.  I made that eagle, long eagle putt and I shocked myself by making it, too, and I thought to myself, I could do it.  And then immediately after, I said, nope, you've got to focus on each and every hole, and I just kept throughout the course of the back nine telling myself, nope, we've got three more holes, we've got four more holes, we've got five more holes, whatever it was.  I just had to keep focused, making sure I was executing every shot to the best I possibly could.
