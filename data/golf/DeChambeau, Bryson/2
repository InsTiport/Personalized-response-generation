  Q. Kind of assess the hard-fought win there.
 BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   Well, I mean other than this little weird stretch, my longest drive of the year on 10, and the water ball on 11, you know, I played pretty good otherwise.  Couple weird things happened.  I played the par-3s beautifully on the front, and consequently I just kept putting pressure on him and eventually I was able to make a few key putts and he missed a couple and that's the game.  That's what it is.  Yesterday was the same thing, just in the opposite way.  That's the game.
 Q. What happened on 10?
 BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   I heel-pulled it lower than I wanted, came off low off the face, came out low -- I could have easily cleared the trees up and over like I wanted to, but I hit it on the wrong part of the face and consequently hit the tree limb -- hey, look, I was trying to drive the green, whether it was the practice green or the 10th green.  I got it close.  (Laughing.)
 Q. After two rounds, I think I did the math right, so I think you're 3-under par after two rounds if you add it all up.  If you were just to be in a normal stroke play event, would you be not as happy about your game as you are right now because you still have a chance to advance?
 BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   Well, I would say for the most part I wouldn't be taking some of the lines I'm doing out here on the golf course, so I don't know what my score would be if I was playing stroke play.  A lot of it is gamesmanship and trying to put the golf ball in certain places to make people feel certain ways.  I haven't done that very well this week, haven't taken advantage of 6, and so as you look at it from a stroke play perspective, I think my score would be different.  In a positive way or negative way, I don't know.  But I will tell you that I would not be taking some of the lines that I would be in stroke play.
 Q. Is that kind of fun knowing how you've kind of transformed your game and your body over the last couple years to be able to try to try some of those lines here?
 BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   Yeah, like 1 is a great example.  I haven't hit it that great a drive on 1 the past couple days, but hopefully tomorrow I get a good drive on the green.  10 is another one I thought I could go at it, too bad there was a tree limb in the way and it caught the ball.  A few others out there, 18 I can go for, 5 is always fun.  There's just some holes I can take some advantage on and haven't really done that to the fullest this week but hopefully tomorrow I can do it.
 Q. I know you're being aggressive, are they swings, or just a matter of this is the golf course and sometimes when you're aggressive you're going to catch a tree limb?
 BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   Well, look, if you catch -- that was my fault.  I definitely pulled it into the tree.  But I will say there is some quirky places around here.  You can get some weird lies.  Hit a great drive on 12, wind took it over to the right and landed and it got up in the face of the bunker, and into the wind I couldn't even reach the green.
 So there's just certain unique characteristics about this golf course, a lot of undulations, and you get in some weird places by trying to hit it up there.  Sometimes it is better to hit it down the middle of the fairway but I'm willing to take that risk.  You know me.
