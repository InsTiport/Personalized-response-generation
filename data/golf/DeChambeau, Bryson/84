Q. Right back in the saddle.  Bogey-free today.  Thoughts?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, it was a good round for sure.  Unfortunately had a couple three-putts and had some missed opportunities, but I'm a little rusty on the putting green.  Got to go work on the speed a little bit.
Hopefully tomorrow be a better today.
Q. You spoke of rust.  You had a few weeks off after a banner season really.  What does Bryson DeChambeau work on in the off time?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, I do a lot of research.  I actually do.  It's fun going and getting to understand some things I didn't understand last year.  You know, then it opens more doors.  It's is never-ending puzzle, the game golf.  I love it and I love trying to figure stuff out.
That's what I was doing.  I was also helping put together my house.  I've got some people that are helping out there, too.  But it's been a fun process trying to get all comfortable in the new house.
Q. You speak of figuring out the puzzle.  T7 here last year.  Something that fits your eye?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, I like the golf course.  Suits my eye really well.  When I do mishit it I can mishit it in the right spots and I'm able to get up and down.  When I can attack flags and make some putts it's good combo out here for me.  I feel good out here.
Q. You just met Alec, Shriners Commercial Ambassador.
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah.  It's cool to meet a superstar.  He's all over on the place.  No, he's a great representative.  I wish him the best.  Anything I can ever do for Shriners I'm all for.  They've been great to me for the past couple years.  They gave me an invite here a few years ago, and can't thank them more.
