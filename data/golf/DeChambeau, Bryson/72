 Q.  A little more like it today I would assume.  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Absolutely.  Just been working a lot on my game with a bunch of different facets.  I've changed the putter, changed shafts in the irons.  I've changed driver shafts, driver heads, 3-wood heads.  I've changed literally almost everything in my game coming from last year.   
People would call my crazy, but that's just the way I am.  I want to get better in every facet.  To me I've only played well in dry conditions.  I know I've said that before.  Trying to figure out how to play better in wet conditions is a difficulty of mine.   
Today it was a little bit drier out there and I was able to control some things a lot better and didn't make too many mistakes.   
 Q.  Noticed a couple shots I saw the first couple days a lot of this afterwards, motioning the ball to get moving.  How did you find the speed today on the greens?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: A little faster, which was nice.  Definitely left a couple short still out there.  No. 9 left it right in the heart, a few others out there.   
But for the most part greens are starting to speed up and play the way they should be playing.   
 Q.  How did you notice the golf course playing any differently from the first two days?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's going to be a difficult test.  I know with it being Saturday and it's getting close to the end of the tournament, people are going to get a little more nervous.  There are some tough tee shots; 17 is a not an easy tee shot, so you never know.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Thank you appreciate it.  Hopefully he can get after it tomorrow and get it done.
