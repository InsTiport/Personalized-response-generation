 Q.  Bryson, congratulations on a terrific win.  What was your mindset before the eagle putt on 16?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Just trying to get it close.  First off I wanted to say thank you to Cobra Puma Golf.  They've helped me get to this point.  And Bridgestone, they've done an incredible job, so thank you.   
(Indiscernible.)  I actually got one in my house just recently, so they're helping me out tremendously.   
 Q.  And tell me, you're now ranked fifth in the world.  How does changing this early in the season change your goals for the rest of the year?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, man, I don't know.  I was just coming out here to try and kick rust off and was able to play some good golf.  Didn't putt my best, but was still able to get it done.   
Pretty proud of that.  Put in a lot of hard work with my team.
