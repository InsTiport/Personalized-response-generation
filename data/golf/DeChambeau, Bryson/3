  Q. Bryson, what was going on the first nine, ten holes?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   Golf.  I was hitting it pretty good for the most part.  I don't know what happened on 4.  That's the game.  I'm okay with it.  Still smiling after.  I fought really hard.  It just seemed like something wasn't going my way today for some reason.  Just I could feel it.  It was weird.  Just numerous putts that I hit, it was like, okay, that's a really good putt, and it didn't go in.
 I striped a 5 iron on 8, hit two great shots on 9 into a really bad spot.  10, hit a great shot in there.  It spun too hard for some reason, I don't know.  11, just sprayed my drive right.  Even after that on 14, I should have hit a hard drive over the right side rough, and I just didn't go after it for some reason, which is kind of dumb on my part.  Missed a 15-footer on 15.  17, hit a great shot.  Didn't go down the hill like I wanted to.  18, I played flawless and lipped out a putt.  There were a few numerous putts in the beginning that just didn't go my way.  That's golf.
 Q. You put yourself behind early.  Then you had to try to catch up.  Tee shot on 4, what do you --
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   I don't know.  I was trying to hit more of a low bullet and just kind of caught the heel, a little high on the thing.  It wasn't really a top, it was more like a thin ball that just had no spin on it and just knuckled.  If there was a top there, it would have been down on the ground.
 But it's one of those things that just didn't have it all today.  I was proud of the way I fought, proud of the way I persevered, and there's still more tournaments to be had.
 Q. That's probably not something you've done very often.
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   I've never done that.
 Q. Really?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   No, not in competition.
 Q. What club did you have?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   It was a hybrid.  Just one of those things I tried to squeeze and hit it too hard, got on top of it and hit it thin.  Caught the grass below it and just never got any height.
 Q. What happened on the second shot?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   My 4-iron cracked.  I looked at the bottom of the thing.  I couldn't use it all day.
 Q. On that shot?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   Yeah.  It sounded really weird and just came off horrifically, and I'm like, oh, and there's a line in the bottom of the club.
 Q. What would you say is the difference between Sunday a week ago and today, in terms of the way you were swinging or whatever?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   It's just the putts didn't go in.  I actually felt way better today.  Like from an execution level, doing what I did on 18, that was the most comfortable I've felt in a long time, even 17 and 16 and 15.  All the swings were, for the most part, really comfortable, and I was playing good golf.  Just things didn't pan out the way that they, I thought, should have, and I set myself behind the eight ball quick, and I wasn't able to recover fast enough.
 Q. With your view on learning something every time or whatever the case may be, what's the lesson you're going to take from this week?
 BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU:   I can play on golf courses that don't really suit me.  That's a big lesson.  I'd also say, no matter what happens, no matter if I pop a shot, no matter if I thin, whatever it was, and make a really good double or could have been triple or quad, I'm still never out of it for the most part.  I know my game is good enough in most facets to get it back and compete with the best of them.
 So it's just a little bit of a learning block, and I'm going to go back and work really hard on my golf swing and figure out how to, again, be less sensitive.  I was more sensitive last week and pulled out the victory.  I got a little lucky.  Just putts didn't fall today.  I hit a lot of great putts that didn't go in.  That's the unfortunate part about golf sometimes.  It is what it is.
 Hat's office to J.T. for playing the way he did on that back nine.  It was very impressive.  That's why he's one of the best players in the world and will continue to be one of the best players in the world for a long time.
