  BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I played my game. I controlled what I could control and made a couple of putts here and there that were key, and hit a couple of shots close. Unfortunately, again, I did miss a couple of putts like on 13 for birdie, a 6‑footer. 16, as well, missed a 5‑footer, that could have easily gone either way. And if I made those putts and just do what I should do on 18 I could be leading.

Q. How tough is it to end having played the round you did today, to end like that?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Not tough at all. It's just a golf shot. People think, Oh, my gosh, he was nervous. No, I wasn't nervous. I pulled two shots. It's a disappointing factor. But again that's golf. You've got to learn from that and play your best tomorrow. 

Q. I think we're confused. Take us through the match?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: First tee shot, left, unplayable. I went back to the tee‑‑

Q. Unplayable, but not out of bounds?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: No, but that's a one shot penalty. I pulled it left again, TOI, I think. And then I got to actually move it on the other side, over on the left and I had a nice pitch shot, just short of the green. Lying four and then five. I hit five‑‑ yes, hit four, five, six, seven, exactly. So that was it. 

Q. It sounds like your energy and body language is good. How is your confidence?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Absolutely. I'm ready to go out and do my best tomorrow. Today, that's enough. I can't control that. I did my best, I just don't like a left‑to‑right wind every once in a while. And I should have been big enough to hit the crank ball, and hit it way down there. Even if it went in the bunker, trying to hit that low, low bullet, you could do that, I just pulled it and that's all it is. Nothing more than that. I'll go work on it on the range and do some work.

Q. Talk about what went good for the first 17?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yes, please, guys, come on. I controlled my ball beautifully. I was doing that all day. And I think that I got a couple of lucky breaks on 11. On 11 I pulled it just a little bit, and I capitalized. That's what it's all about, when you get those lucky breaks, you have to capitalize. And I did on 11. 
Nice shot in on 12, made birdie. 
And 13 got really lucky. Good break and I tried to get it up and down. 
I made a great par on 14, driver, wedge, right on the green, two‑putt. 
Just keeping it simple and trying to be as patient as possible out there until the birdies came. 

Q. What will you take away from today playing with Jordan?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: How controlled he was, even when it didn't look like he was in full control. He was still able to capitalize and make putts out there and that was it, a huge, key factor in performing the way he has.
Unfortunately I didn't do that in a couple key moments. And could easily be right up there on the top of the leaderboard.
But again, it was a great day. I shot even par under tough conditions and I'm looking forward to the tomorrow.

Q. How are you going to approach it tomorrow?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: If it's really windy like today I'm going to try to keep my ball low for the most part and hit as many greens as possible. 

Q. Let's talk about the positives, great through 17 holes?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Thank you. 

Q. Made the cut?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I did. I'll take it.
I had a great day. It was a nice walk in the park. Unfortunately it was sour at the end, but I can't look at that. It is what it is. It's just an anomaly, and it won't happen tomorrow.

Q. It won't?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: No. 

Q. I know you just did it a couple of times over there, but could you run through 18?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I hit it left, took an unplayable, went back to the tee, hit it left again. It's a TOI now. I hit it next to the fence. Had to move it across. So, one, took an unplayable. Two, back at the tee. Three there. Four short of the green. Five on, six, seven, two‑putt. 

Q. If you had to estimate, how far was where you dropped it from where that ball was?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Probably 45 yards left of where the ball was laying, easily.

Q. When you stood on the 18th tee what were you thinking? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I was trying to hit a low, low ball down there to keep it under the wind and have the wind not effect it. And it didn't effect it. I pulled it left. I came over the top. It is what it is. That's the game of golf and you aren't always going to get the best out there. I got a couple today. It's a give and take and you learn from it. I'm not going to do that tomorrow. 

Q. You look comfortable out there for most of the day.
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, I'm comfortable. I'm loving it out here. It's a great experience. I'm learning a lot from it. There's nothing bad that I can take away from today. I may go bang my head a couple of times‑‑ no. But, again, 36 holes of golf left.

Q. Did you allow yourself to think about being in the final pairing, potentially, looking ahead?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I mean, yeah, but I was on 17 and I went and striped the drive, cranked the drive. I think what may have been part of the issue, too, on 17 I hit a crank drive, which is a really different golf swing. And usually when I go back down to the lower speed swing the club face does rotate a little bit more. I just didn't take that into consideration.

Q. What's the mentality of making another drive on the same tee? Do you go through other thoughts when you're up there a second time?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Just trying the same thing, hit a better drive, obviously.

Q. Do you think nerves are a factor?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Well, I know there's adrenaline. I believe more in adrenaline. And there are nerves. People get nervous and they can't hold it in their stomach, getting really kind of sick to their stomach. But for me, no. It's just a good opportunity to show my character and my grace, as well. 

Q. You had the best round of the day going under the conditions until 18. How does that rank with some of your best golf ever?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Well, it's not my best golf. Absolutely not. Olympia Fields would be some of the best golf I've ever played. I was 19‑under par going into the last match and the nearest competitor, I think, was over par. 

Q. Was it good golf?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It was great golf, it was no doubt it was beautiful golf, just wasn't my A‑plus plus game.

Q. What do you think you've learned the past two days that you couldn't learn from practice rounds?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Oh, the speed of the greens. That was a big issue. I know the whole golf course. I know what it can and can't do, what it does and what it doesn't do. I knew it was going to be a challenge my first time. But tomorrow I've got to come out strong and play some good golf. That's what I'm looking forward to.

Q. What is it like looking up at the scoreboard and seeing your name?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I belong.

Q. Did you have any visions or anything before coming to the event, seeing your name on the leaderboard?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: No. 

Q. Would you say that over all you stuck to your game plan pretty well?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, there were two moments where I got very fortunate that allowed me to be that far under par, 4‑under par. And I was on 11 holding a 5‑iron, but it went left of the hole. And I made that putt. 
And on 13 it stayed up on the bank. That kept the momentum going. 
And made a birdie on 15, great up and down. 
And then 16 if I just two‑putt that. 
And go to 17 with I different mindset. Still a good drive, but I tried to go after that pin a little bit, pulled it long and had to make a tough up and down.
And 18 was completely comfortable off the tee with that wind. We could think about different ways this could have gone down. But at the same time I'm even par, shot two great scores. And I'm ready for the weekend.

Q. What did you hit into 13?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: 13, I hit the gamma, whatever that is. 

Q. You were able to give a pretty cut and dried breakdown of what happened on 18. Is there an emotional part of it or do you shut that off? 
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I'm not emotional. An execution is what I'm trying to accomplish on the golf course. If I can do that, stick to my game plan, nothing else matters. 

Q. You said that it showed you that you belonged. But hadn't you already proved that to yourself with the results this past month?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, this is different, though, this is a major. I knew that going into it, but at the same time I played 12 practice rounds and I knew that I could post some good scores. Unfortunately I just wasn't that great today. But it was pretty good, I'd say. 

Q. (Inaudible.)
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Absolutely. It gave me some more confidence. He was a gentleman to say that to me out there and I really appreciated it. It meant a lot to me, yeah. 

Q. Have you had many comments from back home?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Look, Central Valley is my home, it will always be my home. I couldn't have done it without the support and help of Clovis business. And tough times for some people going, what is he doing, why is he going to do this? And look, I'm just trying to play this game, play my game. And I have the support of so many back there or I wouldn't be in this position today. So it's great thanks I give them.
