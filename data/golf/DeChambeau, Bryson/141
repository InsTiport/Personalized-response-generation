Q. 64 in the first round, level par in the second.  What was the difference between the two days?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I didn't hit as many fairways.  That was the big struggle and then a couple putts didn't drop unfortunately.  Made too many bogeys as a consequence of not hitting the fairway.  Hopefully this afternoon I'll do a little better and see where it goes.
Q. You have a huge amount of American support out there; you signed a lot of autographs on the end.  How much does that help on big occasions like this?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's fun.  Support from the US is awesome always, especially being your home country.  It's great.  I love the guys, I love signing autographs and having fun with them.
Q. What do you make of the prospect, you're going to be playing in the final group alongside Rory McIlroy and the leader, Andy Sullivan, how exciting is that?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Just another round of golf.
Q. You did say you wouldn't be used to disruption, so how is it dealing with all of this and what's your formula for it?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Again just comes down to hitting fairways and greens and making putts.  I didn't do as good a job today but hopefully I can do that this afternoon.
Q. Does it mess with your preparation?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: No.  It's just another shot.  You've got to perform in that situation and that's what I tried to do.
Q. You've never played with Rory before; have you ever met him?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I actually gave him my spot at Chambers Bay on the range, the practise range, but that was about it.
Q. Is that quite an exciting prospect?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, it's always fun to get to play with a top player in the world.  I'm sure I'll obviously learn in that situation how to handle it and it going to be a great preparation for the Masters.
