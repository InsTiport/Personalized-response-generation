 Q.  These are your first FedExCup Playoff.  What's it like?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: This is only my second event in the Playoffs.  I'm just excited to be here, first off.   
I also would like to take a little bit of time to give my prayers and thoughts to the victims of Hurricane Harvey.  That's the most important thing on my mind right now; I'm from Texas.   
Every birdie that I make is $250 toward the Red Cross and also every eagle I make is $500.  So that's the first and foremost thing that I would like to say.   
But also, being here, having this opportunity to make it to the FedExCup finals and the Atlanta TOUR Championship, it's an incredible honor.  I know I can do it.  I just have to go out and play some good golf.   
 Q.  You got off to a good start today.  Talk about how you build momentum with a goal in mind.  You're good for Chicago.  So as you said, Atlanta is the bigger picture.  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, I think every day analyzing after the rounds what I didn't do well, what I did do well and focussing on how I can improve on the little aspects of my game.   
For example, not catching a flyer on No. 9, trying to control that out of the rough a little bit better so I don't make bogey there; or hitting a couple more greens or hitting a couple more fairways, how can I do that in certain wind conditions.  That's what I'm focusing on and if I can do that, I think I'll make it to THE TOUR Championship.   
 Q.  What would it mean to even be competing in Atlanta and have a chance?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: About a month and a half to two months ago before I won the John Deere, I didn't even know I was going to be in the Playoffs.  That's the weird part and scary part about it, as well.   
At the same point in time, honored to be here.  I think that it would mean the world to me to be able to come from not even having a chance to making it and then all of a sudden here, having a pretty darned good chance to make it.   
 Q.  History shows that momentum, lightning strikes:  Billy Horschel, even Rory last year, in the middle of the pack, and all of a sudden, boom, you've got a big chance.  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, anybody can do that because that's what this game is out here now.  All of these guys are good enough to play well every single week, but it's about the streaks now.  If you can get three or four good weeks now at the end of the year, lightning strikes, and pretty quick, too.   
 Q.  Not a bad start, 2-under.  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: No, not at all.  I'm excited in these tough conditions, with me not hitting it that great, I was able to scramble and make some good putts, key putts when I needed to.  Unfortunately ended off on kind of a sour note, but at the same point in time I'm still right there in the mix.   
 Q.  Going bogey-free around here is going to be tough today.  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Not easy.  Not easy.  And I was looking to do that.  I've been managed myself really well.  That's one of the things, too, that I'm learning out here is being able to get it in the hole when the going gets tough.  When your swing really isn't on par, being able to get it in the fairway or hit it on the green and 2-putt from 50 feet or whatnot, just to keep the momentum going.   
 Q.  People talk about you being an analytical guy, but how much do you actually look the at projections?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I actually don't look at that at all.  I try to focus on what I can control.  My game, the execution level that I can hold myself to.  That's really all I can do.   
 Q.  What do you think about 12?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's a really interesting hole.  I don't know how to describe it.  If you hit a 3-wood just short of the bunker, you're going to have like a 5-iron, 6-iron in, depending on the wind.  Even 4-iron if it's into the wind, and that's what I've been known for is great ball-striking from the 175 to 210 range, so I rely on that quite a bit.  I was just able to hit it into that range and ultimately hit it to 30 feet and 2-putt.   
It's not easy with this wind.  The wind is swirling he everywhere way and it's frustrating at some points in time because you can't control it.  You hit a shot and it's doing one thing and half a second later, it's going the other way and you just can't control it.  It's tough.  It's very difficult and frustrating for us players.   
But the more that you can keep the ball a little bit lower and take your 30, 40 feet and 2-putt, get out there of and make some birdies on the par 5s and short par 4s, you can take care of business out here.   
 Q.  Can you talk about your involvement in golf design with Tiger Woods?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: What do you -- I'm sorry.  What do you mean?   
 Q.  I read an article about you and Tiger Woods designing golf ball.  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Oh, Bridgestone.  We weren't personally designing it, but we have some input as to what we like and feel and see -- want to see out of a ball flight, the trajectory of it.   
The golf ball, you can't do much more with the golf ball.  There's so many limitations now that all you can really do is better the aerodynamics a little bit.  So seeing different trajectories in certain winds is what we're trying to accomplish now.  I know Tiger is obviously trying to do that.  He's coming back.  It was great to see him chipping the other day, or yesterday.  It was pretty sweet seeing that.   
For us, the guys at Bridgestone, I think just looking at optimum trajectory is the main importance for us.   
 Q.  You're only a handful of shots off the lead but behind Dustin, as opposed to maybe somebody else.  Is there a difference there being two shots or three shots behind Dustin versus three shots behind somebody else?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, obviously it makes a difference.  He's a great player and he's not going to let off the gas pedal and that's one thing you have to take into the account.  At the end of the day for me, I don't worry about other players.  I try and focus on what I can do at hand with that shot.  Unfortunately I didn't take care of a couple par 5s today, which I knew I could have, but didn't, and ultimately it will come down to that:  Who plays the holes better.  It's not necessarily who has a better advantage technically.  It's who plays the holes better at that point in time.
