Q. Just a few comments about your round, Bryson.  I'm really curious, I've seen for two weeks now, guys have really been fooled a lot by distances.  Did you find that today, and what was going on?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   Yeah, it was very difficult out there.  The wind played tricks with us today.  It's one of those things that I've obviously got to get a lot better with my iron play and wedging.
Q. You experienced it, but I saw a lot of it last week, as well.  Is there something with the wind?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   It swirls a lot.  For example, on 5 today, I had 230 in and I felt like at the moment when I was standing over it, it was 20 miles an hour downwind, and when I hit it, it dead stopped.  Can't do anything about it.  You hit a good shot --
Q. What did you hit?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   I hit 7-iron, and that thing flies 207 for me when I hit it good, and I felt like it would carry, and it obviously didn't.  That's golf, man.  I mean, you're not going to shoot the lowest number every single day.  It's the cumulative score of four rounds.  1-over, I felt like I played really bad, my wedging wasn't great, and if I can tidy that up and make it a little better, make some putts, keep driving it the way I'm doing, I'll have a chance.
Q. You made a lot of nice six-footers.
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   Yeah, my putting was still great.  I started off a little slow, but a three-putt on 11 doesn't help.  One of those things, one of those days, and I don't know what to say.  It was like the twilight zone out there for me.
Q. I know it's just a stock drive for you, but a lot of people will be talking about your 423-yarder on No. 1.  Did you catch that a little thin or was it okay?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   No, I hit it a little high on the face.  It definitely came out with sub-2,000 spin, I think.  Just 191 ball speed I saw, and I hit a great drive and got a good kick.  It's one of those things.
Q. I know you've been doing this for a while, but is it at all cool to see where the ball is landing compared to previous times you've played here?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   I sometimes can't believe it.  There were years where I hit 5-iron into that hole, and now I'm hitting a 30-yard little shot.  It's wild.  I'm just blessed that I've been able to figure some stuff out with the driver.  Got a lot more to work on with the wedging and iron play.
Q. Did Cantlay talk your ear off out there today?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU:   We had a lot of great conversations, actually.  It was awesome.  We enjoyed each other and had a good time.
