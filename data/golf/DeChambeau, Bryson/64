 Q.  What happened on that inward nine? Like you woke up; really well played.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Thank you, appreciate it. No kidding. I didn't play bad on the front nine. Just didn't get anything going; didn't make a couple putts that I needed to make.   
Then I was fortunate enough to get it going on the back nine. Made a couple ten-footers, and then left myself in a poor position on the par-5, 13. Lucky to make a 40-footer there, and that got me going the right direction.   
Got a little unlucky on 15. Killed a 3-wood and just bounced too far to the right and a really bad break there. It's a hole that if I can play 2-, 3-under, I'll be fine of.   
16 got a bit of a bad lie. Hit it over the green, knocked it on, and made birdie.   
It was just a sequence of events starting to finally play some good golf.   
 Q.  You made more than 115 feet of putts out there.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Wow. I didn't even know that.   
 Q.  A lot of that came on the 14th hole.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, 40-footer or whatever, so that definitely helps. So I think at the end of the day if I can get the ball rolling a little bit better and get some breaks going my way, that's the game of the game. You know it.
