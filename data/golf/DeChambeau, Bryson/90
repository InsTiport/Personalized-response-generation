Q. You teed off today, like I better go as low as I can go in case we don't play anymore golf?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, potentially.  I still think that we have next week off so we're going to finish it, even if it finishes on Tuesday.  I still think they're going to do it.
It's tough because it cuts into our week off, you know, and two big weeks coming up.  So, I don't know necessarily how to deal with it.  We'll take it as the punches come.
Q. How are you feeling?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Very tired.  I mean to go out and shoot 64 today with my conditions, I'm very happy, very pleased.  I wish that I would have had a little more energy, we could have had a little more time to prepare for this course because this course, the greens are completely different than last week.
I've been thrown off this week because of it.  At the same point in time, I'm starting to get more comfortable on the greens.  Tomorrow I'll be ready.
