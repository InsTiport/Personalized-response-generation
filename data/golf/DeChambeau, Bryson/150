 Q.  Bryson, spectacular play.  I know it wasn't the finish you were looking for but wow, what a week.  Even par for the first three days and it clicks today for you in the final round.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: The first few days I was a little rusty and today I played a little bit better.  Still had some issues with the wedging but that will be resolved come Masters time and looking forward to that week.   
 Q.  What was the strength of the game today to be able to go low?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: My putting.  I made a lot of putts off the start.  I saved one for par on the 2nd hole from 25 feet and 1st hole made it about a 10-footer and 3rd hole good two-putt, 4th hole made a 4-footer.  Made a lot of putts.  5th hole as well I made another 15-footer, kind of got me off to a good start.   
 Q.  I would imagine being able to be in this field and Mr. Palmer's tournament had to be a thrill for your young lifetime.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, absolutely.  I was lucky enough to be able to meet him in his office and that's a moment I'll never forget.  I met him once back at the Walker Cup practice session with Captain Miller and the team.   
Getting to see him again is pretty special.  He's just a great ambassador for the game of golf.  I hope to do the same one day.   
 Q.  Congratulations and great playing.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Thank you very much.   
I think the big kind of kicker for us was on the 5th and 6th hole.  He made a nice little 20-footer, I made one on top of him and hit a nice little wedge shot on 6 and chipped in on me.  He kept one upping me all day and did it on the last as well.   
 Q.  We were laughing that you birdied 15 and 16 and can't even get honors.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: That's kind of the tough part but, you know, he's a great player.  Shoot, it was a lot of fun getting to play with him and get some great experience.   
Little better than the 78 over in Abu Dhabi with him.  Exciting to get to play with him, get comfortable and play well.   
 Q.  Bryson, you have the bogey on 14 and come right back with the birdie on 15.  Could you have done that two years ago or is that a sign of --  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: No, definitely maturity.  Even yesterday I was running a little hot and probably would have done the same.  I was a little more relaxed and calm and able to hit two great shots in three.   
The unfortunate part about this week, there were three holes I didn't even touch the green on all four days.  That really killed me.   
14 was it -- 14 was one of them like 2, 3-over and then 7 was another one.  Well, no.  No.  No, what was another one?  2, 2-over on that hole.   
Just a few things I need to clean up with my long iron game and it was a difficult part about it, too, I switched clubs right before this tournament and wasn't extremely comfortable.   
But, again, still learning, little bit more time and I'll be ready to go for the Masters.   
 Q.  How comfortable would you say you are being out here now?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Pretty darn comfortable.  Yeah.  It's nice.  First time I was out here last year at the FedExCup St. Jude Classic, a little nerve-racking.  Today wasn't really any adrenaline.  More of a motion going through, going through the motions.  Hitting great shots and make something putts.  Even though I didn't have my A-plus game today it was still an A game and played pretty well.   
 Q.  On No. 2 as you said, you were short of the bunker but getting up and down making a sandy par.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Little bit of momentum.  One day I hope to get that momentum out of the equation no matter what, I'm still executing shots even if I do hit one bad but that's going to take time.   
 Q.  What is it like for you to realize that Rory is only four years older than you?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Makes me sad.  He's doing pretty well.  I hope to do the same but you never know.  I'm definitely a different person.  Shoot, I hope I can get to that stature but, you know what, golf is a fickle game.  I'm just even enjoying the moment right now and having a good time playing.   
 Q.  How do you plan to spend the next couple of weeks leading up to the Masters?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I'll be going to Hilton Head next couple of days, get a little practice in and I have Augusta three more times, I have three days to myself, which will be nice.  Practice there I think Thursday, Friday, Saturday.   
Then after that going back over to play the Georgia Cup I believe and practicing a little bit at Sage Valley as well.  Trying to get myself ready for the Masters.  Then on Saturday I'm be there Saturday before the Masters I'll be at Augusta.   
 Q.  Bryson, obviously the physics and stuff of your golf game.  Is the mental aspect the one that's the most challenging when you turn pro?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, definitely.  Like I said a little bit ago, I'm trying to take the emotion out of it, trying to take the problems out of it because that's really what can happen to somebody out here.   
Like yesterday, it hurt me.  I was playing pretty well, still didn't have my A game but ultimately cost me 3 shots on the back-9.  If I can get the emotions out and make non-emotional execution I'll do just fine.   
 Q.  Where are you planning to kind of set-up house to live, still live in Dallas?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I'll be in Dallas and playing out of Trinity Course, new golf course that's being built out there, hosting the Byron Nelson in 2017, 2018.  I'm not certain.  I'm looking forward to being there.  It's nice on the taxes and it's also a good place to travel out of.   
 Q.  How long do you estimate it taking you to get those irons completely --  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: It will be done in the next couple days.  That just can't happen.  It will be done.   
 Q.  You fed off Rory today.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I mean we were both feeding off each other.  I was also hitting great shots.  He was make something great chip shots as well.   
It seemed like every hole we pretty much -- I thought he was going to make the putt on 10 and I was going to knock it on top of him but, no.   
For the first 9 holes we were feeding off of each other.  It was great to get that experience.  You could see what momentum is.  It's fun to have momentum but hopefully down the road I can still execute no matter what the situation.  I got a little bit out of my momentum when I hit the bad wedge on 12.   
 Q.  Any advice he gave you today?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: You know what, we really didn't talk about any advice.  We just had a lot of fun out there and talking about what he's got coming up next and then what I'm doing.   
 Q.  Georgia Cup for you.  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Exactly.  That's pretty much all we were talking about.  Enjoying each other's company.   
 Q.  How does this round compare to Abu Dhabi?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: It's better.  I think it's way better.  I actually performed playing with one of the best in the world.  Gives you confidence.   
Just every single day I'm learning.  I'm an intern, getting better and better.  Hopefully by the Masters week I'll be ready.  Even after that.   
If it's not Masters Week, if it's Hilton Head, great, you know, but I hope to get to learn quickly and be ready to go by Hilton Head.   
 Q.  Speaking as an intern, when you watched the Masters in the past, was there a particular year, this is great learning even on television watching it?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: My favorite moment was Tiger's chip-in on -- in 2005, the back of 16 green and went back there and thought well, that's pretty incredible what he did and under the gun and all that.   
That was a moment that really stuck out at me.  I'll never forget.  Really turned my mind, I want the play in that event.   
 Q.  Did you go out and hit balls after that?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah.  I never forgot me watching these events on TV, U.S. Open, Masters, PGA.  I got to get out there.  I want to get out there.  It really inspired me to do good.   
 Q.  What do you learn about yourself traveling all over the world as opposed to still being in college and going to events in the U.S.?  
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: You become a global player.  Difference between a States player and global player.  In order to grow the game, you got to be a global player.  I hope to be one day, too.  That would be great for the game of golf.  I've got a little bit of a different flare, kind of unique.  Hope I can shine some good light on the game of golf.
