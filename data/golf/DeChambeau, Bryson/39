Q. Give us your thoughts on how everything has evolved over the last 24 to 48 hours.
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: It's been weird. Last night, 9:50, you just see a text, and you're like, Whoa, what's going on? I feel bad for everybody that was working this week. They've got a job to do -- albeit we have jobs to do, but we're playing for some good money. I just feel badly for the people that are hourly-employed and they aren't making money that they want to. So for me, it's more about protecting the human race and making sure that everybody is taken care of proportionately and their families are taken care of most importantly.
Q. Is it kind of weird not knowing when you're going to play next?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, it's a nice mid-season break, I guess you could say. A few weeks off is never necessarily a bad thing, but certainly we want to be playing for World Ranking points, Ryder Cup points, Olympics. We want to be doing that. It's sad to see, but at the same point in time, I think it's the right call and the right decision, and Jay made the right decision.
Q. Were you good with how the information came out, obviously the announcement with fans and then the announcement to cancel?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, I don't think there was really any other way. We're trying to do our best to show our appreciation and respect to the sponsors of this event and people that work for the event and make sure that it's done in the right way. I think Jay did a great job.
