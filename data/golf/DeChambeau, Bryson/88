Q. Just kind of a tale of two nines today?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, for sure.  First off, the rough is brutal out there.  I've never encountered something that thick.  It's a zoysia and Bermuda blend, and new conditions for me again.  Seems like that's been the story these past couple events I've played in, and it's really just put me not in the greatest plays.  But hopefully I'll learn from it and not hit as many errant tee shots.
Q. So driving was what went wrong on the front nine?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: For sure.  If I would have drove it a little bit better it would have been fine.  I drove it well enough to shoot even par, but those chip shots around the greens.  I mean, I could believe some of the lies I drew around the green.  It was near impossible to judge and understand.  Really penalizing.  It was like hitting it in the water and kind of frustrating.
Q. How important to your psyche was it to be able to know to battle back on that back nine, knowing, hey, I can get back in this?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, for sure, absolutely.  You're never out of it.  I've got 54 holes left.  You know, a lot of golf to be played.  And if I get my game going, if I get my driving in the right direction, watch out.
