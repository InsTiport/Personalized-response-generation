Q. Did you think that was going in for a double eagle? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I thought it was. I was so excited to hopefully get some of that crystal, but I was just happy I made eagle because I missed a fiveâfooter on 8 the other day for eagle and that was a little frustrating, but at least I got something out of the week. 

Q. What are your takeaways from this? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I've got to fix whatever is going on up here. I have no idea. Just dizziness. It's only when I go from down to up, so I can't even like think and talk right now. But that's just what happens, I go down and up and my brain gets all disoriented. I've got to fix that, and once I fix it I'll be even better than now, and when something arising in the future, I'll just keep trying to fix it. 

Q. Is it still more of the same, better, worse? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: It's better than where it was on Friday, but I will say thatââ and Saturday, a little Saturday. But still, it's tough. I'm hydrated, everything is fine. It's just about orientation. There was numerous times where I was over it and I just felt super uncomfortable. I couldn't see anything. I couldn't see the line. It was really weird. I missed a lot of putts today. 

Q. Considering the way you were playing when you were coming in, do you feel like this was a missed opportunity for you? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, absolutely. At the beginning of the week I felt like I could have a great chance to win the tournament if I just played my game. Shoot, I made enough birdies this week and eagles to have a chance to win. There's no doubt about that. I made way too many mistakes that I've got to talk about with my caddie and go, hey, how do we not make these mistakes anymore, how can we work better as a team to have that not happen. 
At Winged Foot we did a great job of it. This week we didn't. We didn't place it in the right places and I misâhit a lot of shots that usually are pretty easy for me. Numerous factors that were in play, but to have all this adversity and to still finish it off somewhat decent and be under par for the week is great, even though I feel like I shot 15 over for the week, really, to to be honest with you. It was one of those things, one of those weeks. 

Q. Was there anything about your game plan you'll have to change for the Masters going forward? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, we're going to try and work on a golf ball that will fit it a little better with my wedges. My wedges are stillââ this week I'd hit wedges in, on 1 I hit one and it spun 30 feet back and off the green. I can't hit anything less than what I did. It was a 110âyard shot and I took it back halfway and through and went through and it spun back 30 feet. 
I've got to work on some ball stuff. I've gone through the whole club scenario. That's as much as I can do there. So hopefully we can come up with a ball that will do some more things that will be helpful. 

Q. How impressive is it for a guy like Bernhard at his age as far as he hits it to be playing with you guys? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Yeah, he's an unbelievable iron player. He grinds over everything. Doesn't give up. His long iron play is stellar still, and I think that's what makes him so amazing, and definitely I still look up to him. Even though I'm bombing it by him, he's still playing better than me. It doesn't matter. That's the cool part about the game of golf. You can shoot a score whatever way you want, and he's able to do it still at his age that way, which is pretty impressive. 

Q. What did you hit into 13? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I hit 9âiron. 

Q. When is your next start? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I'm starting at the Tournament of Champions. I'm looking forward to that. That'll be a bomber's paradise for the most part. No pun intended. But I've got to fix some stuff first and tidy up some, I guess you could say, wedge stuff and putting stuff and get my head fixed. 

Q. If you're not 100 percent, what percent are you right now? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I'm 60 right now. Yeah, I mean, it's tough for me to walk out there, up and down the hills right now. Just from a perceptual. Every time I get up I'm winded and I just don't feel great. It's weird.
