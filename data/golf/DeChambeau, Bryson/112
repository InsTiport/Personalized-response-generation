 Q.  Bryson, how would you assess your round?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Well, yesterday actually felt like I struck it better overall, but today I was able to score.  I made a couple more putts.  Lipped out a few, too, but I'm putting well, and usually when I'm putting well, it's going really well, obviously.  Nothing different, I don't think.   
Starting to get my ball-striking back.  That's the only thing that is kind of different.  Hoping to make it even better the next couple days.   
 Q.  A lot is riding on the FedExCup.  Do you think about that or do you try to putt it in the back of your mind?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I was kind of thinking about that, you're trying to make the top eight, so a clear pick, the top eight.  That was a big deal for me, and obviously not making that is disappointing.  I felt like I had a really, really good year, and to miss it by one spot is disappointing.   
But now, it's actually relieved me a little bit and I'm not as stressed about it anymore, especially with where my game is at.  I'm like, all right, if I make it, I make it, and if I don't, I don't.  I've still had a great, great year, that's the way I look at it.   
 Q.  How do you feel about the field, the weekend, there is a lot of players.  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: A lot of great players, obviously.  Two more days, 36 more holes, anything can really happen.  You've got a lot of guys up there that are pretty big powerhouses, and hope I can just kind of slide right past them.   
 Q.  Are you confident?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, I'm confident.  I think as I go practice here a little bit, just re-affirming some of the things I was feeling on the golf course, hopefully tomorrow will be a good day.
