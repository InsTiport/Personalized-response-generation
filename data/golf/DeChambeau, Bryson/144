Q. What was it like waiting through the morning to play your first match in the Walker Cup?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It wasn?t that bad. I was just trying to get myself healthy and my neck healthy. It was good enough to go out there and play. The adrenaline kicked in and I hope it will kick in as well tomorrow.
Q. What was it like to make that par putt on the 18th hole after it looked like (Ashley) Chesters had control of the hole?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It felt like I won the match, honestly. The half-point there was pretty big. I probably should have hit drive off the tee box, but unfortunately I didn?t hit my best hybrid. I was fortunate to get it out (fairway bunker) and get it up and down from 140 yards.
