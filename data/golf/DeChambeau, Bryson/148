  BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Something I'll never forget, and especially playing with Spieth, and him shooting 66. That was a fun day to watch him do that and make some putts out there.   
I was thoroughly impressed with how he controlled his putts in the wind. That's one thing I kind of struggle with, and I hope I can be a little bit better tomorrow at that, understanding how much wind is going to affect a putt. That's what he did a great job of today, and I hope I can do that tomorrow.  
   
 Q. There always seemed to be a crowd around him, it's bigger now and it's louder. Did you sense that big buzz around Jordan or did that make a difference?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: No, I dont notice that stuff. On 6 apparently I tapped in a one‑footer after Spieth made a 10‑footer and the crowd was still clapping. It didn't matter to me. They're great in supporting Spieth, not only Spieth but Casey, as well as myself. It was a lot more fans for Spieth, I know that. But at the same time it's not that big a deal. You're honored that they're actually out there watching you. I don't worry about that stuff, I try to keep that in the back of my head.  
   
 Q. Do you converse with the guys out on the course, what was that like?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's golf talk. It's nothing crazy, nothing special. But just talking about certain putts every once in a while. But he's really nice, and it's been fun to play with him today.  
   
 Q. Adam Scott said he's never more nervous than on the first tee in Augusta. What was it like for you?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I wasn't nervous at all. I had some adrenaline gong but I stepped up there and striped it right down the left-center. Most people, I guess, say they're nervous. And, look, as I've been saved by grace, it doesn't matter, this is just another golf shot out here. And if I can perform to the highest level, great. If not, it's an opportunity to show my grace and character.   
Yeah, I'm disappointed. I can be disappointed. I can have a little adrenaline, but there's no nerves. You just go out there and you play and have fun.  
   
 Q. What did you think of the ceremonial shot? You came out specifically to watch that. What was that like for you?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: That's a memory I'll never forget. To see Mr. Player and Mr. Nicklaus stripe those shots and start this tournament off. It's my first Masters, it's a special experience. It's not one I can fully describe just yet because it just happened a couple hours ago. But it's one that I will remember for the rest of my life. And I can't be more honored to be around there and have that atmosphere. I was comfortable, you know, it was fun to see that.  
Also Rickie was up there, too, which is pretty cool seeing him do the same thing. I really appreciate that about Rickie. He's a great guy, and a great ambassador for golf, too.  
   
 Q. What were you trying to do on 15 there?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I was trying to get it on the green. And I absolutely nuked it. The wind died down. It landed on the back edge of the green, shot over the green. Look, I tried to hit a little pitch shot that would bounce and skip up but it skipped right through that end of the green. It's been doing that all week, and it didn't do it that time. It was quite shocking to me, but I'm just glad I got it up and down. It was not the right decision to hit it over the green. I wasn't trying to. If anything, I thought I'd just barely get it over. It was 256 to the pin and I thought with that wind, a nice smooth little bullet 3‑wood, and just flew right through the wind and hit on the back edge and went over the green. That's not an easy place to get up and down from, especially when it's downwind and hit just a fraction too hard. Again, the grain didnt make it pop up and went in the water. That's what happened.   
   
 Q. Do you think it was easy to maybe try to be too aggressive because Paul and Jordan are so many under par and you don't realize that? You guys are separating yourselves from the field.   
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: You know, you're right. But at the same time I was just trying to play my game. I'm not trying to focus on anybody. I was going to do it no matter what. I looked at my caddie and said this is a no‑brainer, it's a normal 3‑wood, and I just happened to nut it and it went right through the wind. I just hit it right on the face, perfectly on the face, and that's all you can do. I can't control it once it comes off the face.  
   
 Q. What is it about Spieth, it's a tough course, but he plays so well here?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: He loves the greens. We were walking up 18, I don't know what it is about this place, I just love putting here. I can see the break, I can see the lines. That's what he said. I was quite impressed with that. Again, it was fun to play with him and to see how he performs and reacts after certain putts. It's a good experience. I'm still an amateur, I've still got hopefully a few more years in me, but we'll see.   
   
 Q. You said you're impressed with how he controls his putts in the wind. What does that mean, what does that look like?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Just depending on the wind and how much wind there is. It's gusting out here. It's very difficult to control. On these fast greens it affects the putt, moves the putt. And it did for Jordan on No. 9. He said wow, this isn't going to play as much. And when it died down a little bit and we didn't play enough break, he missed it low. It's all depending on the wind.   
On 7 for me, I was putting down the hill and the wind was ripping off the left. And I hit a good putt, it just took a side winder turn right before the hole. You can't do anything about that. It's complete gusts. You can't truly control it. Yes, you can, if you have a controlled environment of a constant wind, learn how much a putt is affected by a certain wind. But at the same time we're just artists out there. We have to play like an artist out there, and that's what I did on the greens today.
