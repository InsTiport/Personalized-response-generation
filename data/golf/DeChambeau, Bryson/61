BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: 2-over on the par-5s is not what I want to be.  That's something I'm going to have to work on and figure out a new game plan and strategy for tomorrow.
Q. Do you feel you got off to a good start?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Absolutely.  Anytime you can shoot 2-under in an Open you're in a good place, I would say, for the most part, given I think Rickie finished at 5.  That's obviously gettable.
And I've got to do a lot more work.  I was coming back off of a lot of neurological damage that I've had from just hitting bad shots and not doing the right things with my swing and just going down rabbit holes that weren't really pretty.  It's going to create some neurological damage there for me.  And I'm trying to get over that as of right now.  I'm doing a pretty good job so far.  Today is the best I've felt in a long time.
Q. You mentioned the par 5, what happened on 18?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I bladed it.  I butter knifed it, as they would say.  That's just the way it works.  Sometimes -- it was a little bit of an uphill lie, I was trying to pick it too clean and I just absolutely four-headed it.  I luckily didn't kill anyone.  That was my major concern.  I didn't care about the ball.  But I was fortunate to get it up and down.  I putted really well on poa annua greens.  I need to keep that going tomorrow.
Q. How comfortable do you feel on the major stage now?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I'm getting there.  The more comfortable by golf swing gets in a lot of pressure situations the better I'm going to be prepared.  Normal Tour events I don't have as many jitters anymore.  And majors I still do.  But as time goes on, I'm 25, you know, so I've got a lot more time to play in these.  Missing it in the right spots would be the best thing for me.  If I can do that and keep it in play when I don't execute my best shots, I think that's the key to this golf course.  You short side yourself you're going to have a 40, 50-footer for par or you may be chipping it the other way.  You've got to have great iron play.  And that's something I did really well today for the first time.  I'm going to keep going with that.
Q. Do you think the soft, sort of gettable conditions are a response to the last couple of years for the U.S. Open, trying to make it more reasonable?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: I think the wide fairways contributes a lot to it.  I don't think it's necessarily the soft greens.  You can only get the greens so firm, relative to what iron shots you're hitting in.  If you had a 4-iron in -- for example, like today they did a great job on 17.  The green was soft.  That's the way it has to be for that green.  And it was into the wind.  I had a 4-iron, I hit it and it landed and rolled out two yards.  That's acceptable.  It's not acceptable when you hit a nice 4-iron and it rolls out 15 yards and it goes over the green.  What are you going to do?  So I think they did a great job of that and I hope they keep it up.
Q. As a California kid did you sense the support out there?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Absolutely.  We're from Clovis, we're from Fresno, Central Valley.  All the support is out here and I really appreciate it and hopefully I can give them something to hoot and holler about.
