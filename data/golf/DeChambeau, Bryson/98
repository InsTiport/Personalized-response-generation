Q. How does that win feel?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's amazing this.  One was different.  I had to grind out a couple shots at the end.  Wasn't expecting a couple of the shots I hit; a little nerves here and there.  Not really knowing what to do under the gun like that with that tremendous of a lead, I'm kind of trying to protect a little bit.  It was a big learning experience for me.
Q. You've gone right to the top of the FedExCup in one foul scoop?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, absolutely.  That's great.  I'm super stoked to be No. 1 right now, and see what next week and the weeks after hold.
Q. What message do you feel you've sent Captain Furyk?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: I said I was a man on a mission yesterday, and hopefully he can see that I've got some grit and grind, and that even when I don't execute certain shots, I can get it done.
