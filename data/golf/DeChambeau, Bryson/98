 Q.  Just your assessment of today's match overall?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Well, we didn't get off to the best starts on 2 and 3, and, you know, this is a golf course that you need to be up quick to kind of give yourself a good cushion going into whatever -- you know, the middle part of the golf course, the middle parts of the golf course is gettable, and we just didn't do a good job of that.   
And you got to hit it in the fairway.  And so we tried our absolute best today and we fought all day and we worked hard together as a team, and it just wasn't meant to be today.  But I'm hitting it really well.  I know Phil's going to get it back, and we're going to have a good rest of the week.   
 Q.  Are there any positive takeaways that you can take away?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Yeah, knowing that I wasn't nervous the whole day.  People may have thought I was nervous, and I wasn't.  I just hit some shots that were a little uncharacteristic of me.  I'm not comfortable with how much wind is out there, and that was really it.  And people think -- people have their thoughts, and I know that I'm hitting it just as good as I ever have.  And looking forward to hopefully playing the next few matches.   
 Q.  Is there anything specific you were working on out on the range?  
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Just reaffirming how good I'm hitting, that's really what it was, and I'm not hitting it bad at all.  I had a couple miscues, and that was more of just not playing the right shot.  You know, I didn't hit a bad shot today is what I have to say about it.  And No. 4 affirmed that, No. 10 affirmed that.  On some really difficult driving holes I was able to hit it down the fairway.  Looking forward to a good rest of the week.
