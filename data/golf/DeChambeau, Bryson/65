Q. The momentum changed on 10 or maybe ‑‑
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, yeah, 9. 9. I mean, shoot, even on 7 I hit a good drive and the wind didn't bring it back and it hit a tree and went right. I hit it up there and, again, just weird stuff that started to happen with my wedges around the greens in wetter conditions. And mind blowing to me. 
Then I get to 9 and I hit a perfect drive after getting back to 7 and I'm thinking, okay, the back nine I can get this to 10‑, 11‑under, you know? And just seemed like conditions at hand changed, although our theory or our, from what we normally are used to seeing, there's something else that changed and so we don't understand it yet. 
It's frustrating, because I executed everything to my, the best of my ability. Even that shot on 10 I had a mud ball in the middle of the fairway and I tried to cut it up the slope and it just hooked on me. So what are you going to do about it? 
And then even the chip shot. Hit a little 40‑yard shot relative to what I do on the range all day long, accounting for a five, six, seven degree upslope, trying to hit it 40 yards and it comes out, it shoots over the green and like 60 yards, like 55 yards. I don't get it. 
So that's the game, that's golf, and that's why I love it, but I also hate it at the same time. 

Q. You looked really shocked at No. 9. 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, just completely shocked. I mean, well, that's the thing, like I'm saying, I execute everything I want to and it just doesn't, the result doesn't show. 
And it's been happening for the past two years, but it only happens in certain conditions. And it seems to be in wetter conditions off of unique lies and surfaces. 
And so it's shocking to me and I, it's frustrating. But at the end of the day I'm still got a chance to win it, I'm obviously, what am I, four back right now? That's not too bad going into the weekend, right? If you would have said, you would be four back you got a chance, so. Not terrible, but surely I could be 10‑under right now.

Q. Do you think of the other stuff more or what do you think about the putting?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, I think more about, I think more about what happened on ‑‑ oh, my putting was atrocious today. I couldn't believe, I couldn't believe the putts that I missed today I usually don't miss. It's just something, there's something up. 
'16, I did the same thing in 2016. I had it up there, I bogeyed that hole and made par on the next and then tripled the last. And so there's just something weird that I got to get out of my system or something, or figure something out so I'm confident over certain situations. 
Because I get over the putt and I'm like, this is perfect. I hit it and all of a sudden the thing breaks left. And it's a part of just not knowing what the greens are doing but just weird stuff, weird, weird, weird stuff. It was a really, really weird day.

Q. Do you have a theory about what's going on?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Well, I've got plenty of ideas, I don't know if they're right. I would say.

Q. (No Microphone.)
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Well, the one on 9 is the most disappointing and frustrating. I think what happened there was that I didn't catch the spin rate, the proper spin rate. I caught a lower spin rate with a lower trajectory and it just flew right over the green and just kept ascending. 
Normally we think on a downhill slope to an uphill flag it's going to go shorter, it's going to play even more uphill and clearly the wind must have shifted just a little bit off of the right and not into us and I drew it with the wind and it actually helped it, probably helped it and then I had a lower spin rate and it just said, see ya later.

Q. Why do you think that happened?
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Just because of a down slope, because of the down slope. I mean, sometimes if I catch it just right it will deflect properly and it will go through the turf with a lot of spin and then if I, if it‑‑ well actually, excuse me, if it deflects, it comes out with a lot of spin. If it doesn't deflect, I can hit it high on the face and it just seems like it just launches off of that. It's like I'm hitting a 6‑iron off of that. 

Q. Are you able to let this go? How do you let it go? 
BRYSON DECHAMBEAU: Oh, from a score perspective, I don't care, it's not a big deal for me. It's more about the execution in situations, that's what I care about the most.
And today it seemed like I was doing everything I possibly could right‑‑ just like on the last hole, how does that ball stay in the middle of the slope? You know. Just seemed like there was nothing going my way all day. Every time I hit a good shot, I just seemed to not get rewarded or every time I hit just a fraction of a bad shot it got amplified by something. And that was the story of the day, unfortunately, but I got two more days to figure this out, still four back, just like I was in 2016, different player than 2016.
