Q. You ended up on top as you always do.  What is it like to hold that trophy?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: It's an incredible honor.  I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be able to win this championship, and with all the dedication and hard work that I've put into making this possible, it's finally realized and I'm so excited and so honored to be everybody's champion, U.S. Amateur champion.
Q. I spoke to your mother and your brother on the last hole, and they summed up this year, 2015, as surreal.  Do you agree with this?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Absolutely.  Starting out with the NCAA win and then going and playing in a couple tour events with the big boys out there, it was an incredible experience.  And then to top it opponent there with the epitome of amateur golf is pretty incredible.
Q. For people that have doubted you and the way you've gone about it and you've played your game; you're unconventional and you're unapologetic about it.  Where have you learned this belief in yourself?
BRYSON DeCHAMBEAU: Honestly from God.  He's helped me understand that golf isn't the most important thing in my life, and if I'm able to do my best for Him, that's all I can do, so thank you.
