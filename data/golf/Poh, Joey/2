  Q. Joey, tell us about your round, you went out in 42 and back in 40. Key holes for you?  
 JOEY POH: Good holes will be the first. I sank a 10-foot putt for par.   
 And for the bad hole would be the fifth hole where I tripled because of a bad bunker shot from the green-side. .  
  
  Q. How do you after triple-bogey, after you pick yourself up, what do you say to yourself to keep going and actually pull it back?  
 JOEY POH: I told myself that I have done it in the past and just the next hole and the next shot.  
  
  Q. Did you have fun today, how were you feeling overall?   
 JOEY POH: I had fun today because my flatmates were really nice and encouraging and friendly and it was good fun today.  
  
  Q. Who were you playing with today? Tell us about what they said to you?  
 JOEY POH: I played with Lindsay Wright and she's really nice and between shots we were talking about how hot the weather is. Also she told me about there's this tournament in Australia next week, and we were also talking about how Thailand was. And my other flat mate is Wendy Ward, she's also very friendly and we talked about --  
  
  Q. Were you looking for airplanes? She mentioned yesterday you were going to try to look for?   
 JOEY POH: We were going to be looking for an airplane but I think we were so focused that we didn't talk about it.
