  Q. Joey, what was your score today?  
 JOEY POH: 83 today. 42 on the front and 40 at the back.   
  
  Q. Birdies, bogeys?  
 JOEY POH: Birdie on the 12th hole, and I had two doubles, one on the second hole and the 17th hole.   
  
  Q. Who were you playing with today?  
 JOEY POH: I played with Amanda Blumenherst and Michele Redman, and they are quite nice, but I didn't get to chat with them today because I was actually concentrating on my game more.   
  
  Q. What was your reasoning for not chatting to them?   
 JOEY POH: Because like they are trying to focus, so I just try not to disturb them and I just try to focus on my game. But my game wasn't really good. Like I have two doubles, and some of the bogeys, I didn't really like it, like there was one that I hit it really close, like three feet for birdie and then I bogeyed that hole.   
  
  Q. What was the support like for you today? It's a busy day on the course.   
 JOEY POH: I have my friends, like all the juniors like following me and I have like quite a few messages before I started. So that felt really good and happy.   
  
  Q. And lots of people cheering you around?  
 JOEY POH: Yeah, and like the volunteers and also the people that are following around, they were just cheering for me, so I was really happy.  
  
  Q. So with one last day to go, what are you thinking?  
 JOEY POH: I think I'll come back strong and play better.
