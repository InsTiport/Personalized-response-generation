 Q. That looked hard for you out there?
 JOEY POH: Today was really tough and I almost gave up halfway round. I had a series of bogies.

 Q. What was the problem today? 
 JOEY POH: It was just the putting. Wherever I was putting from, I was missing them.

 Q. Overall thoughts? 
 JOEY POH: It was a very good learning experience. 
 And I even though I didn't play well, I learned a lot from my flight mates and I really appreciate it. 

 Q. What has this week taught you? 
 JOEY POH: It's shown me that I have not done enough preparation. I must double up my training. 
 It is still my dream to play on the tour one day.
