 Q.  You scored an opening round 74.  After that, could you have imagined in your wildest dreams that you would now only be four shots off the lead?  
SARAH JANE SMITH: No, not really.  I felt like it was close but I've not played well here in the last few years.  I was actually joking with my husband this morning; it was my first time ever teeing off 1.  I haven't had a lot of success here in the past, but I love it.  I love this golf course.  There are a few things I've been working on that have been coming together, so it was nice to see it actually show up in the score.   
 Q.  Now that you are where you are, what's your goal for tomorrow?  
SARAH JANE SMITH: Same stuff.  You know, I'm working on some rhythm in my swing.  I get really quick, so it will be interesting to see how I go in a better position, hoping to try and keep my swing speed down and see how that plays out.   
So I'll just try and keep doing the same stuff.   
 Q.  Did you just find yourself getting in a groove the last couple of days?  
SARAH JANE SMITH: Yeah, it's funny, I think what I've struggled with here is the greens, and we've kind of finally figured out that I read too much into them.  I holeda I few nice putts early yesterday, and yeah, just my swing is finally starting to feel a little more in control.  I get so fast, so to be able to slow it down has made things a lot easier.  It was tough in the beginning but it's starting to feel more comfortable.
