   AMY ANDERSON: After I got through hole 1, my stroke started feeling better and so then it came around.  
  
  Q. You had at crowd cheering for you out there.   
 AMY ANDERSON: Oh, yeah. They're so much fun out there. I feel like there's so much support for me, so I was having a blast, even though I wasn't playing well at first.  
  
  Q. Having an entire day off - and obviously you were in pretty good rhythm - what does that do to you, and how did you pass the time the entire day?  
 AMY ANDERSON: I enjoyed it. We played five holes in the morning, and then I practiced till about noon, took care of some media stuff.  
 I just went home, took a nap, tried to catch up with some friends. We went out to dinner. Just really low key. Pretty relaxed.  
  
  Q. I've heard your birthday is this weekend; is that right?  
 AMY ANDERSON: Yes, tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Celebrating your birthday at the U.S. Open, how great is that?  
 AMY ANDERSON: It's awesome, and especially that I'll be playing. That just makes it all that better. It's a great atmosphere. It's a lot of fun. I couldn't really have a better birthday.  
  
  Q. Your birthday is tomorrow, then?  
 AMY ANDERSON: Yes.
