Q.   Okay, 64 today, I know that stretch out front got you thinking about the magical thing when you made the turn.
TED POTTER JR.:   Trying to do the best I can.   I was playing well the last couple of weeks, trying to get through the round.

Q.   What's been the improvement today that you've seen from your game after the last couple of weeks coming in?
TED POTTER JR.:   Definitely putting.   I've been struggling with my putting the last couple of weeks and I hit the ball solid.
But I hit the ball today, too, on top of it, so it shows out there.

Q.   When you woke up this morning you knew the greens were going to be ripe for scoring, how nice was it to get on this golf course early?
TED POTTER JR.:   It was definitely nice, greens were soft, there were a lot of pins that you couldn't get to yesterday afternoon before the rains came so definitely a good day to go low on.

Q.   If I told you were going to shoot a 64 and be a few off the lead, would you have believed it?
TED POTTER JR.:   Probably not.   Keegan shot well out there today so it's a good start to the rest of the week.
