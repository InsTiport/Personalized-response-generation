Q.   An exciting day for you?
TED POTTER, JR.:   Definitely.   The first time to step foot over here on the par‑3 contest and the first time I ever play in it and to win is pretty special.

Q.   How close did it hit on 8?
TED POTTER, JR.:   35feet or something.   I made a long putt there.

Q.   Did you hit before Kuchar or after?
TED POTTER, JR.:   Before.

Q.   You did? 
TED POTTER, JR.:   Yeah, Kuchar stuffed it in there.

Q.   How special is it your first time here? 
TED POTTER, JR.:   I mean, it's just a special place.   I mean, just to be here and be a part of it is awesome and a dream come true.   To come out here and play in the par‑3 and win it is special to me. 
I don't care about the curse saying you can't win both.   Just winning something here is‑‑ makes my week already. 

Q.   Won some crystal already?
TED POTTER, JR.:   Yeah, just won some crystal already. 

Q.   What time did you finish your round?   Do you know? 
TED POTTER, JR.:   I teed off at 2:34.   I don't know how long it took. 

Q.   Were you aware that there was‑‑
TED POTTER, JR.:   Yeah, they told me.   I putted on the last hole and they said 4‑under was in a playoff.   I was like, well, I'm sure somebody will post 5.   You watch some guys come in and slap it around or whatever.   They don't really want to win it or whatever.   But to me, I did.   Very happy how it came out.

Q.   Did you birdie No. 9 in regulation? 
TED POTTER, JR.:   Yeah, I birdied 7, 8, and 9.   And then 8 and 9.
