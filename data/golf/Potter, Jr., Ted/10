 Q.   What a nice, solidly played round of golf.   
TED POTTER, JR.:   Yeah, well I started out good.   4‑under on the front nine and just try to get cruising to the house there.  
   
 Q.   Bunker game really helped you out, you were four for four in bunker saves.   
TED POTTER, JR.:   Yeah, definitely keeps it positive on the round when you can get up‑and‑down out of bunkers for birdie, par, or whatever it is.   Bunker game was very good today.   
   
 Q.   And you were rolling it so beautifully, just 24 putts in that opening round.   
TED POTTER, JR.:   Yeah, I rolled the ball really well today.   Just tried to hit my spots out there and hopefully they fall in.  
   
 Q.   Talk about your strategy coming into the season.   You played at Hyundai, finished 25th, and missed one cut at Sony and then 24th last week.   How are you going to stagger your schedule with a two‑year exemption?  
TED POTTER, JR.:   Trying to do probably two weeks in a row, I don't really want to go four weeks in a row but if I have to, I will.   Try to get a nice set schedule where I don't get wore out this year; where I played seven, eight in a row last year, so hopefully that works out better and play more consistent this year.  
   
 Q.   I understand you got engaged in Maui.   Did you do it up right, Hawaiian, full moon, water coming in?   
TED POTTER, JR.:   She probably would have liked that but no, I didn't.   She knows me better than that.
