 Q.   Ted, talk a little bit about being here at THE PLAYERS for the first time?   
TED POTTER:   Well, it's definitely a treat to be here and be so close to home at the same time.   It feels like a little bit of a home match for me.  
   
 Q.   Recollections of watching this tournament growing up?   
TED POTTER:   Yeah, definitely, watched a lot of it and seen some of the good shots and some of the good shots that have gone bad too.   So definitely a tough track.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever played it before this week?   
TED POTTER:   I've played it once or twice before this week.  
   
 Q.   Talk a little about the closing three‑hole stretch here.   
TED POTTER:   I mean, par‑5 is a good par‑5.   You hit a good drive, and you have a chance of going for the green.   But the greens firm up and you've got to hit a really good shot out to the left side of the green, otherwise you can put it in the water.   It felt like a good shot just got wasted.   It's a tough finish to the stretch.   The 17 island green, I mean, you get greedy there and it's a good chance you put it in the water.   If you play it safe and put it on the green, it's not a difficult shot.   But it all depends on where you're feeling it at the time.   
Then 18, water on the left, definitely trying to bail right, but you don't want to get it too far right because the rough is thick over there too.   That's definitely a good stretch of holes down there.   To get to 1‑under or even par, you feel good.  
   
 Q.   Recap your season up to this point for us?   
TED POTTER:   Definitely a lot better than last year, more consistent this year.   I had a stretch in Florida where I missed some cuts, but otherwise I felt like I improved on last year's rookie season so far.
