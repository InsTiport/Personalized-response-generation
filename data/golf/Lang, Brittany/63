 Q. Minus-5 for the day; you started at minus-5; you're at minus-10. You're right up there. Tell me about your day. 
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, I played really solid. You know, I hit the ball great and I made the putts I needed to make and stayed really patient and had a lot of fun. 
 Played just really good golf. Those putts that sometimes go in, don't go in, they went in today, so it was good.

 Q. There is always a chance you'll be in a playoff if Lexi doesn't produce. But on the whole, were you pleased with the week. 
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, absolutely. Fought hard on Thursday. I shot 3-over on the front and then shot 4-under, so I'm very happy with the week. I played really solid and doing a lot of good things.

 Q. Tell me about Solheim. Are you ready for it? Are you looking forward to it?
 BRITTANY LANG: Yes, I'm ready for it. I've been working hard and I'm extremely excited. It's the most fun I've ever had on a golf course, so I'm just ecstatic.

 Q. Any outlook on how things will go or are you just going to go and have fun?
 BRITTANY LANG: Definitely going to have fun. I love the girls. We're going to have so much fun. It's all good fun. We're all friends. It's going to be a good battle, but we're going to have a good time. 

 Q. And you're friends with the European...
 BRITTANY LANG: Oh, yeah. You know, it'll be serious, but at the end day it's just golf. We're going to have fun.

 Q. Tell me if you observed at all Thompson's round or game this tournament?
 BRITTANY LANG: You know, I haven't really seen her play much. I've never played with her, but she's obviously very impressive being that young. I don't know how old she is, but I know she's young. 

 Q. She's 16.
 BRITTANY LANG: To play like that, it's very impressive.

 Q. You're ancient yourself. 
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, well I feel like it out here.
