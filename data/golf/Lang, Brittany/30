 Q.  Brittany Lang, nice third round here, 6-under 66 ties the low rounds for the week.  What was the game plan today, anything in particular that gave you the edge?  
BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, you know, I had a rough Thursday.  I really struggled.  I still felt like I was playing well and I had a really good back nine coming in yesterday.  I think I made like five birdies on the back nine or something.  So I had a lot of good momentum.  I just felt really good.  I wanted to be really focused today, just pump up the intensity a little bit more.  I was playing with Sandra, who I'm really good friends with, so we had a really good time.   
 Q.  You went out in 31 on the back nine, your first nine holes with four consecutive birdies.  Were you in the zone on that stretch?  What was going on there?  
BRITTANY LANG: Sandra and I were just talking, having fun and I was hitting the ball so crisp, so pure, right at the flag.  So I was definitely in my zone.  It's so nice to get off to a start like that, especially on a course like this, because you can make a ton of birdies.   
 Q.  Solid play today.  What part of your game do you want to take into tomorrow in the final round?  
BRITTANY LANG: Probably my putting.  It's coming around.  I'm working on just staying down in my putts and having a little better tempo.  Could I have done a better job with that today.  I missed like a 5-footer on the last and probably a 7-footer on the other hole.  Maybe just hit a few more in warm up and staying down a little bit longer, because I've been rolling it good.
