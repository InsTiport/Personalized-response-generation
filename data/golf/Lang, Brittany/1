  Q. Could you just tell us how Jackrabbit played today compared to Cypress Creek yesterday?
 BRITTANY LANG:   It was definitely friendlier.  I didn't quite play very well, but there were some spots early on the front nine where you could make a lot of birdies, and then coming in there were some tucked pins on the back.  I definitely think it played easier, I just didn't play very well today.
 Q. Being a past champion, what were the major challenges playing this year's championship over two different courses?
 BRITTANY LANG:   Yeah, it was interesting.  I'm just thankful we're getting to play the U.S. Open in this crazy year.  But I think they did a great job with setup and the two courses are similar, and as usual, the USGA, I just think they did a great job balancing it out.  I thought it was going to be interesting, but I don't think it's that big of a deal.  I don't think it's going to have that big of a factor of determining the winner.  I think it's very fair.
 Q. We're coming to the end of the year.  Overall assessment of your game even though it was a challenging year?
 BRITTANY LANG:   Yeah, I've been playing really well.  It's funny, I haven't been handling my nerves very well.  I was out of golf for a little bit and having back from having my daughter, and my nerves are a little bit shaky, and we haven't had fans and stuff, so just finishing rounds and staying in the round and being confident finishing up, but my game has been super solid, and I think I just need to get control of my nerves and get back into the swing of things, and I'll be in good shape.
