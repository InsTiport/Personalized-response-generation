Q.   So you were one of the few players out there with a subpar round out there today.   Tell me what it felt like out there today. 
BRITTANY LANG:   Yeah, well after playing yesterday, this course doesn't feel too tough.   With no wind and warm conditions, it didn't play very tough. 
They set the tee boxes and the pins up pretty favorable.   So I think there's some low scores out there for sure. 

Q.   What's your experience been like this week? 
BRITTANY LANG:   Yeah, it's my first time to Wisconsin.   I've really enjoyed it.   The people are super nice, the fans are great, and I like it.   I like the terrain.   It's really pretty.   I've really enjoyed it a lot. 

Q.   I'm sure it did, but did the lack of wind, do you think, help things today? 
BRITTANY LANG:   Yeah, for sure.   With that wind yesterday it played extremely tough.   It was hard to pick clubs, it was hard to hit shots.   With that wind it was a real test for the U.S. Open.   The other days without the wind it didn't seem like the U.S. Open. 

Q.   Thank you. 
BRITTANY LANG:   Thank you.
