  Q. We don't have to assume how disappointed you are. Your partner, Juli Inkster, just walked off, 0-2 as a duo.   
 BRITTANY LANG: We didn't do that well. I know she's really disappointed because she wants to play well out here. She did well, but she's really upset with how we played.   
 We did okay today. We did a little bit better, but they played phenomenal golf. They didn't miss many shots and they played great golf.  
  
  Q. It didn't appear you guys had your best stuff though, why?   
 BRITTANY LANG: No, we didn't have our best stuff, but we hung in there. We just didn't have a window.   
 Any time we'd have a chance to make a birdie, it would burn the edge or get a kick here or there. They were right there putting for birdie anyway.
