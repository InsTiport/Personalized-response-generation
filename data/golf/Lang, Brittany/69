  Q. A good way to end a round. You were tied for second. It's great finish.  
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, I mean, I didn't really finish exactly how I wanted to. I didn't make a lot of putts today. I hit it great again, and that was probably the worst I could have shot today was -2.   
 Because I hit it great. I had opportunities on every hole. Missed a couple 5-, 6-footers for birdie, parred hole 8. So kind of it was the worst I could -- but I'm happy. It's something to build on. It was good.  
  
  Q. Did you get a sense, okay, first place is looking out of reach?   
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, I didn't think she was that far. I hadn't looked at the scoreboard in a little a while. But when I saw she was at 17, you know, I obviously went for it in two on 17 trying to make eagle there and hit two good shots. Must have just barely gone over.   
 But, yeah, I tried to make something happen the last few holes.   
  
  Q. What do you do between now and going overseas?   
 BRITTANY LANG: I'm gonna go home. I'll be with my boyfriend for a little while. Gonna go home to Dallas and see my family.   
 I'm gonna go work with my coach, see my family, and take like a week off and prepare for two weeks before Asia.  
  
  Q. What are you taking from this event as far as any ball-striking, your irons, you putting, playing in all types of weather?  
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, I'm gonna -- just a lot of positive. I played great and made some good shots happen coming down the stretch. You know, I was comfortable out there. I'm gonna take a lot of positives.  
 Anything could have happened. I hit the edge a few times. A few putts could've dropped. So I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing. It'll happen.
