Q. So you have to feel pretty good about where you're standing heading into the weekend.
BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, I feel great.  I haven't taken a look, but it's got to be pretty good, 13 under.  Yeah, I'm doing a lot of things really well.  I just need to do a few things better coming down the stretch.  I got a little bit tired towards the end here.  But, yeah, I'm excited for the weekend.  I'm in a good position.
Q. What is the game plan?  Does it change anything knowing how low scores have been the first two days?
BRITTANY LANG: You just have to stay aggressive.  Yeah, the weather looks great.  The course conditions are going to be great.  You just have to take good shots, stay aggressive, and get a few putts to fall.  Should be a fun weekend.  There's going to be a lot of birdies made.  Got to go for it all.
Q. What was the key to your round out there today?
BRITTANY LANG: I did a lot of good things.  I hit a ton of good shots.  It was tough with the wind at times.  It was so warm, and I hit a bunch of good shots.  I think yesterday we did a better job of getting close to the hole.  That's why it was a 9 under day.  I think, on the weekend, we might give the weekend a little more credit because it was definitely tough to pick clubs out there.  The key was just patience, knocking a few in there and getting some confidence early.
