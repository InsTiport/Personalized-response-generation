Q.   I heard you made a ton of birdies out there today?
BRITTANY LANG:   Yeah, I did.   I've been hitting it great for about a month now.   So I'm seeing my shots, and I'm playing with confidence, which I haven't been.   So I don't think the course is too terribly difficult if you're hitting the ball good, just be smart on the greens.   Yesterday it played really easy.   Today, obviously, a little harder with the breeze.

Q.   So the position you're in good for the weekend?   The outlook still good for you?
BRITTANY LANG:   Yeah, I mean, I know the scores are low, but I'm really pleased to be at plus‑1 because I know I can have a good weekend.   I'm hitting it great. 
I don't know what the weather is going to do.   But just to be smart, and I'm excited to be playing.

Q.   How about the birdies?   Did you hit it close, make long putts, what was it about? 
BRITTANY LANG:   It was a little bit of both.   I hit it to about two feet on holes 1 and hole 9, so those were kick‑ins, and I made a bomb on 17.   That was quite a long putt.   Then I made another like 20‑footer and another 8, so it's kind of all over the board.

Q.   Are you glad you played in the morning rather than in the afternoon today? 
BRITTANY LANG:   Yeah, I think it's a little bit of an advantage, maybe, to have gone late early.   The course could not have played any easier yesterday for both tee times.   But as far as this breeze, it's a lot easier in the morning.
