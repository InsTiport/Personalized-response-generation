 Q.   Brittany, overall good round.   How big was that birdie on 16 for you coming off the three straight?  
BRITTANY LANG:   It was huge.   Yeah, I played really good all day.   It was fun.   It was really fun.   Made just a couple of mistakes on those three holes, but the birdie on 16 was big, and then you know, hit some really good shots coming in, so that was a confidence booster.  
   
 Q.   So did the five birdies on the front nine, is that what made it fun for you?  
BRITTANY LANG:   That was a blast.   Yeah, I was super focused and locked in today.   It was one of those days where it was easy.   You love those days.   You just enjoy them.  
But you know, even with the bogeys I stayed aggressive and that's what I wanted to do.   I made bogeys staying aggressive, and I'm okay with that.   So I'm very happy.  
   
 Q.   So coming into this tournament, final tuneup before the first major.   Is that something you put more pressure on yourself, you really want to play well here leading up to it?  
BRITTANY LANG:   Not necessarily.   You know, this course is in fantastic shape, and it actually, it's somewhat similar to Palm Springs, because you have to shape the ball.   And the greens are rolling really good.   So it's actually a really good test, but yeah, definitely gives me confidence playing good going into next weekend.
