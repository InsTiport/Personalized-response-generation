   MIKE SCANLAN: We'd like to welcome you to the final pretournament player press conference in advance of the pairings at 3 p.m. To my far left, Brittany Lang, making her second appearance following her rookie campaign in the 2009 Solheim Cup where she was undefeated 1-0-2 in three matches. And to my left, Brittany Lincicome in her third appearance on the U.S. Solheim Cup team, 2-4-1 all time.   
Brittany Lang, we'll start with you. If you would, just start talking about being here in Ireland and your first time playing a Solheim Cup overseas?   
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, it's been fun so far. I'm sure it's going to be a lot different than Chicago as far as the fans because we don't have as many over here. It's been great. I've played the course before, and I still have my girls here, so it's been really good.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Brittany, for you, you've played overseas. Talk about what's different when you come over here?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: It's kind of the same of what Brit just said. My first time was over here, so it's kind of you have no idea when you play over here and then you played two years ago in Chicago how different they were without playing one or the other.   
 So for my first time, it was just there are so many people, you're representing your country, and there are so much more emotions that go into it. That was hard to get used to, but you've still got to go out and play your own game.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: You've had a really nice year individually. How can you parlay that into success this week?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: You know, just trust that I'm playing well and hitting the ball well and keep doing the same things. Try not to overthink it, and just try to go out and make as many birdies as you possibly can. Match play is a funny game. You never know which way it's going to go so just go out.   
 I like it because I like to be more aggressive, hit more drivers off the tee, try to go for the par-5s in two if I can and just play more aggressive.  
  
  Q. First question is what's going on with your wrist?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: I knew you were going to ask that. I just wanted to be cool and have both of them taped. I don't know. It's kind of a funny story. They're totally fine. I took an Aleve and I'm good to go. It's not anything serious.   
 The right wrist, our PT kind of thought it was from fishing, catching that 300-pound grouper last week, because it hurts to kind of like do that motion, so like the casting or whatever. Then they thought I was just kind of favoring this one, so now I've got this one taped (laughing).   
 But, yeah, the tape is just kind of to stabilize it to make it a little tighter, but they're totally fine.  
  
  Q. Have you talked to Vision 54 about how to deal with this week since it's so different than a normal week? Because I remember '07 was pretty stressful.   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yeah, absolutely. I was playing awful. Yeah, we've talked. I definitely need to call them tonight or this afternoon before we tee it up tomorrow just to get a few more positive reinforcement vibes going, I guess. Yeah.  
 Just kind of the same things, singing out there. It's going to be nice to have a partner that you can kind of talk to throughout the day when you get down to pump you back up, so that's nice.  
  
  Q. How important do you think mental skills will be this week?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Yes, it's huge.   
 BRITTANY LANG: Oh, it's huge. It's really important. You have to stay inside yourself and stay inner and do your own thing. You have so much going on outside. You have partners and other caddies. It's extremely important.   
 It's going to be difficult, and you have to work really hard to continue to see your own shots and play your own game.  
  
  Q. So trusting yourself will be very important?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Very important.  
 BRITTANY LANG: Absolutely, yeah. You've got to come back to yourself and play in your own game and see your own shots.  
  
  Q. You're one of the long hitters on the Tour. Can you talk about what advantage that will be on this course when it's playing so long?  
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: Long hitter? Yeah.  
  
  Q. Any of the holes for long hitters that will be significant?   
 BRITTANY LINCICOME: The golf course is playing very long, actually. Even for myself to say that, it's definitely going to be a good test. Your No. 1, No. 9 even, obviously, it was a Tuesday-Wednesday practice round, which I don't hit the ball very far for anyway. And then I had like grip 3-woods into both of those holes the last couple days.   
 It's definitely going to be key keeping it into the fairway and hitting it to the right part of the green. Par is going to be a great score out there. If you can par almost every hole, you're not going to be too far back parring each hole.   
 But it's definitely playing long. It's kind of wet. We're picking up a lot of mud on the ball so they're not rolling out.
