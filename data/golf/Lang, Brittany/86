Q. How were you able to put this kind of week together being that this is your first Open championship?
BRITTANY LANG:  I came out here just to have some fun, play some golf.  I had a lot of fun.
Q.  What kind of past experiences did you draw upon as you were out there, particularly on the back nine today?
BRITTANY LANG:  The Curtis Cup definitely.  There was a lot of big crowds out there and then out NCAA Championship, just getting used to all the fans.

It was a lot of fun.
Q.  Can you describe what it was like in this final round of your first U.S. Open and in particular, what was going through your head on the back nine?
BRITTANY LANG:  I didn't look at a scoreboard the whole day.  I looked up and saw that my name was on the leaderboard.  That's all I needed to know.  So I knew I was somewhere back in it.  I didn't look at any numbers.  I think that helped me.  I played very solid coming in.
