Q. So we all know this is the last week for points for the Solheim Cup team.  Is it something that weighs on your mind when you start thinking about it or do you try not to let it get into your head?
BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, you know, I think like I fall asleep more thinking about the fun Solheims I've had and how much it means to me.  But at the end of the day that's not going to make me play better.  You just have to come out and keep doing what you've been doing, which I think I've done a good job of.  I've been working hard and found some things that clicked, just started to focus on those things and not so much making the team.
Q. Have you talked to Juli at all?  Is it something that you have conversations with her?
BRITTANY LANG: Like about the picks?
Q. Yeah, just about the whole process in general or your passion.  Do you approach her and kind of say your case as well if you can't, knowing that she's got two picks?
BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, well, I mean, I don't talk to her trying to persuade her to pick me.  But, yeah, I played nine with her yesterday and I've talked to her about it.  I don't want to be in her position because it's difficult because we're all friends and she's friendly with everybody.
She said it's going to be tough and hard.  But I told her at the end of the day if you don't make the team, you can't really be bitter about anything.  You can be upset, but you didn't make the team.  So that's up to her.  She's going to pick whoever is going to help her win the Solheim Cup.  I mean, of course I want to be on the team, but I'm trying to play the best I can and that's all you can do at the end of the day.
