 Q.   An exhilarating match for you guys.   It turns out so many times, talk about the momentum change on 10, 11 and 12.   
MICHELLE WIE:   It was great.   Lang was a superstar today.   
   
 Q.   How about your putting?   
MICHELLE WIE:   We thought it was great.   We had great team reads out there.  
We had four pairs of eyes on it, and it was great.   We played great.   I finally got my head out of my butt on the last couple holes, so it was good.   
   
 Q.   Your putting, you're 73rd this year in putting on the LPGA.   You looked like you were No. 1 today.   What was the difference?   
BRITTANY LANG:   I think it was the atmosphere, the competition, wanting to beat Europe.   I think it just brings out the best in us.   So it was good.   
   
 Q.   It was great theater.   Congratulations.   
BRITTANY LANG:   Thank you.
