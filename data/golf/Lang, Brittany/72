  Q. What did digging a half point out of this match against Laura Davies say you about and your personality and your golf game?  
 BRITTANY LANG: Well, I've made some big strides with my game. Coming down the stretch I was real solid. But to have halve it with Laura to win the last two holes, that's just great. She's a great player.   
 I made some progress from yesterday because I wasn't too strong coming in. So I'm happy about that.  
  
  Q. Can you summarize what that experience has been like? It's been stressful, but you've brought two points to the board.   
 BRITTANY LANG: Yeah, playing under the pressure coming down the stretch, I've never experienced this, and I need to, and this is exactly what's going to take me to the next level. I'm very appreciative of it.
