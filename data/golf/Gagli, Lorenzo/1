Q. Thoughts on your round today?
LORENZO GAGLI: I played good golf today, even the first few rounds, and playing really solid tee-to-green, so I'm really happy.
Q. And what are your feelings now of being in contention here at The Scottish Open?
LORENZO GAGLI: Yeah, I finished third in 2011, and it's amazing to be here again after eight years.
Q. So given that finish from before at a Scottish Open, is there something about links golf or playing up here in Scotland that suits your game?
LORENZO GAGLI: Yeah, I like.  I like to play links golf, this kind of grass, this kind of, I don't know, difficult courses.  Yeah, I love it.
Q. What were you most satisfied about your round today?  What particular shot were you most pleased with?
LORENZO GAGLI: All the long game was working really good.  Especially for probably the driver all the week.  I'm really happy with the driver.
