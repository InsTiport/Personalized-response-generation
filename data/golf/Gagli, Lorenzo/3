 Q.   14 birdies in two rounds, what has been the key to that?   
LORENZO GAGLI:   My putter was the key for these two rounds, because I put very good.   Also, the game from tee to the green, I played very solid in these two days.   
   
 Q.   Have you much experience of playing in conditions like this on courses like this?  
LORENZO GAGLI:   I like links.   I love links golf because it's another kind of golf, and we have to try to make a few low shots and run.   So it's good.   
   
 Q.   There's been nothing in your recent results to suggest that you were going to play this well; have you felt it coming?   
LORENZO GAGLI:   You never know with the golf, it's a crazy sport.   But I'm feeling good, and I want to keep going with that.   
   
 Q.   Did you enjoy the football last night?  
LORENZO GAGLI:   Yeah, to watch Italy.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you can win the final?   
LORENZO GAGLI:   I hope, with Pirlo and Balotelli, we have a lot of chance to win.
