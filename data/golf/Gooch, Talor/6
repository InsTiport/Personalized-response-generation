Q. Talor, great opening round, 6 under par, but eight birdies out there.  Obviously, in complete control for opening round.
TALOR GOOCH: Yeah, it helps when you make a bunker shot and make a couple long ones.  But, no, it was a good day out there.  Obviously, eight birdies is always good.  So good start to the year.
Q. Greens are in perfect shape.  You rolled the rock great today.  Was that the key as well?  I know you outlined a couple highlights, but these greens are perfect.
TALOR GOOCH: Oh, yeah, it's tough to make putts unless the greens are like this, those long putts, and I made a couple of them.  The greens were great.  My caddie gave me some good reads, and they're just the perfect speed for rolling them in.  So it was fun.
Q. What's the game plan for Friday?  Just a few more fairways and more of the same?
TALOR GOOCH: Yeah, I actually didn't drive it too well today.  I kind of made up for it with my putter.  So hopefully, I can get some more balls on the fairway and get eight more birdies.
Q. Great start.  Good luck tomorrow.
TALOR GOOCH: Thank you.  I appreciate it.
