 Q.  A bogey-free 7-under 65 today.  How did it feel out there?  
TALOR GOOCH: Bogey-free 65s usually feel pretty good, so, no, it was awesome.  I drove it well and hit a few close ones and made it easy on myself today, so it was good.   
 Q.  Looking at your stats, you only missed three greens today, so your irons were obviously on.  Is that something you've been specifically working on?  
TALOR GOOCH: Just everything.  You're always working on everything.  It's felt close lately, even though my scores haven't showed it, and it was nice to finally get some results today.   
 Q.  How are the course conditions out there?  
TALOR GOOCH: Oh, it's awesome.  The greens are really fast, the course is in perfect shape, and you better -- only chance you have of hitting 15 greens is if you get it in the fairway, because the rough is thick out there in spots.  So fairways are a premium.   
 Q.  You were the last group out today and obviously it was very cold in the morning, do you think that played to your advantage today?  
TALOR GOOCH: Yeah, that's what I was talking with Sam about, the only benefit of being late in your wave is the morning tee times, you're not going to get as much cold as the guys who are going off first.  So that's obviously a bonus.   
 Q.  What's your mindset one back of Henrik Stenson who is leading the tournament heading into tomorrow?  
TALOR GOOCH: If I can go hit 15 more greens tomorrow I'll be a happy man.
