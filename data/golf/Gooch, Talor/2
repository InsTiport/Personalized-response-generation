Q. What a finish for you.  You birdied two of the last three holes with monster putts.  I guess technically the one on 18 was a chip, but a 40-footer from off the green.  Tell me about it.
TALOR GOOCH: I was standing behind the putt with my caddie and trying to figure out.  I'm like, dude, this just looks dead straight.  And he's like, I can't see anything.  So it was just starting to the hole and never left, thank goodness.
Q. It's not going to be good enough to win, but at 156 in FedExCup standings, that will get you in Farmers Insurance Open and will really help you in the reshuffle.  Just a great day for you, I would say.
TALOR GOOCH: Yeah, for sure, it's a culmination of a lot of hard work the last few months.  I played a lot of good golf last year that didn't materialize to good finishes and today it materialized to a good finish.
Q. Leaders coming down the stretch.  Tell me how 18 is playing?
TALOR GOOCH: Well if you just hit a 3-wood down the middle and 9-iron on the green and make a 40-footer it's easy.
(Laughter.)
