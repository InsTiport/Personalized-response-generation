Q. A 68 on moving day, what was the difference?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So it was a good round.  There was only one buyer die on the front nine.  My caddie and I have been telling each other to be more patient because there were a lot more holes left where I need more birdies and overall, I think my third round is better than yesterday.
Q. Just one back heading into the final round, currently just one back.  Same position that you were last week at the Evian Championship.  Will you take the same approach?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So last week, I really did want to win a major this year, so I was a little greedy, so the play was a little messy.  But this week, I would like to play a little more patiently and as much as I'm in a good position right now, I'd love to play well tomorrow.
Q. Take us through what you will do tonight.  What are your preparations like heading into the final round of a major?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So tonight, I'll go back to my hotel room, do some stretching with my trainer and then I'll think about tomorrow's round.
