 Q.  How did it feel to get off to a good start?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Nothing different from my usual play.  I think I started off with a really good feel, a lot good shots, and some good putts.   
 Q.  First time playing this course.  What are your impressions so far?  Do you plan to change anything going into the rest of the tournament?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  So today is the second [sic] day that I played the course.  The first day was for the pro-am.  I think that the course suits my game really well; it feels good.   
There is a little bit of a balance on the greens, but I think I can play well round three and round four.   
 Q.  How does it feel playing next to Shanshan and Lexi at the tour championship?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  They are players that I played with before so there is nothing particularly different today, so it was fine.
