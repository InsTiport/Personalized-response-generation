 Q.  Another great day.  What was working well for you today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Overall I think the best thing that I did today was my approach, and I think it was pretty much average that I played today, but when I had that birdie chance, I didn't let that and I put that in, so I think it was a good opportunity.   
 Q.  Just average today; I know we talked the other day about winning the U.S. Open.  You wanted to put that behind you, but at the same time I'd imagine there's a lot of momentum coming from last week and now going into Sunday contending for yet another championship.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Thank you for saying that to me.  First of all, I think I brought a good memory back from the U.S. Women's Open into the Marathon Classic and keep that consistent with me, and I hope I can do my second win in Marathon Classic, as well.
