 Q.  With Sung Hyun Park the No. 1 player in the world; 6-under bogey-free round.  What worked for you today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I got more birdie chances today, but overall I'm pretty happy with my play today, and especially the bogey-free two days in a row.  I'm really happy with that.   
 Q.  Certainly strong play.  You accomplished your goal of being world No. 1 golfer so early in the season.  What's your goal now?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Of course making No. 1 is important, but winning is more important to me.  My goal for this season was five winnings and I've done one already, so four more to go this year.   
 Q.  What about this course brings out the best in your game?  You've finished tied for fourth in two out of your three appearances here.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  The course is not easy actually.  The fairway is pretty narrow and especially the green is very soft and lie is pretty hard to see for me.   
But overall I think I've done pretty well last two days.
