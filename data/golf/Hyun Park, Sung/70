 Q.  You ended on a good note.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yeah, I believe so.   
 Q.  Can you just talk about today; not as comfortable today as yesterday?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It wasn't too bad.  Compared to yesterday, the shot wasn't really great today, so I didn't get many birdie chances today.   
 Q.  You practiced well today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Practice like before the round?  Yeah, it went well.   
 Q.  Do you like playing from behind and chasing?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Not that I enjoy it, not that I like it, but I didn't play well today, so I have a little gap from the top players.  But like personally I feel more comfortable to actually chase those top players from the back.   
 Q.  Are you going to go out and work on anything in particular tonight?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Not particularly, but I'm going to recap how I played today and think about what I can do better.   
 Q.  Rookie of the Year was a big goal of yours, but how much are you thinking about Player of the Year?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I really didn't think about the Player of the Year.  Not yet.   
 Q.  How about the RAMA, Rolex Annika Major Award?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: To be honest, I don't really think about the title much.  I already achieved my goal this year, and I believe I'm doing great.   
 Q.  And the goal was?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: The Rookie of the Year and the LPGA win, a couple times.
