 Q.  Just tell me about your round today and how you felt out there.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I wasn't feeling really great before today's round began, and I was a little bit worried, but as I played today, I was able to play some good shots overall.   
 Q.  Were you sick?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: No.   
 Q.  Just not feeling good mentally?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It's not physically, not condition, but it was just the play itself.   
 Q.  You had to be happy, though, that yesterday's round was wiped out?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I guess it was for me, yes.  I forgot about yesterday's record, and I just focused on my play today.   
 Q.  How did you make the 9 yesterday?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: When I played my second shot, it was okay, but it hit the bunker and then it turned to the right side, and that's how it ended up OB yesterday.  But after that I could have responded better at that moment.  I think that's how I got 9 yesterday.   
 Q.  When you say you could have responded, are you saying that you got angry?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It wasn't about me being angry, it was more about getting the next play, so I think I had a short time to think about the next play.   
 Q.  Were you surprised that the event was cut to 54 holes and the scores were wiped out?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: To be honest, I would be lying if I said I wasn't surprised, but what I did was I just wanted to focus on my game today and go on.   
 Q.  When you get off to such a good start today, does that give you an extra feeling, such a big bounce-back from what happened yesterday?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: When I usually don't play well, I just try to do better and focus on the game, and that's what I'm hoping for every round, and that's what I'm going to keep on doing and focus on the game.   
 Q.  Can you take us through the eagle that you had today, the chip-in on 13?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It was actually -- the distance was 25 meters, so I was deciding whether I'm going to do chipping or putting, and I think after I made the shot, I was surprised, as well.   
 Q.  Are you as calm as you look?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yeah.  Well, I'm not sure but I think so.   
 Q.  Has life changed much since you won the U.S. Women's Open?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It's about the same.  My life is about the same.  But I feel more comfortable playing the game.
