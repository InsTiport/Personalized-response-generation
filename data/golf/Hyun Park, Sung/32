 Q.  Kind of up and down.  What was different today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So there was nothing much different but I think the second shot at nine, that was what kind of did it for me.  And so with the exception of that kind of missed shot, I think I am generally happy with my round today.   
 Q.  So you have been working on having less spin on your ball.  Was that in play today at all?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So not for every shot but there are shots out there where you want less spin.  So for those moments I try to hit the ball with less spin.   
 Q.  You're a couple shots back behind the leaders.  Do you like the position you're in going into tomorrow's round or are you worried at all?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I think I would opt for being more comfortable.  If there was one concern, it's that this course allows a lot of birdies, so it might be a little difficult for me to catch up.  But I do come from behind, so I think I will not give up until the very end tomorrow and see what happens.   
 Q.  This is the eighth week you've been Rolex No. 1.  Ariya is at the top of the leaderboard.  How much are you kind of fighting against that to keep the No. 1 spot?  How will you enter into tomorrow's round?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Of course, remaining the No. 1 player would be awesome, but I think for me, winning is much more important.  I think that's more important than the No. 1 ranking.   
 Q.  On this course at this event, you've got runner-up twice.  Would you be disappointed with another runner-up finish?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yes, I think I would be disappointed.  I think you are disappointed any time you don't win an event, but also at the same time, runner-up is not a bad position at all, but of course I would be disappointed.
