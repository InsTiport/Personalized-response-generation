SUNG HYUN PARK: I thought I was pretty lucky today and I hit some balls in the bunkers, but I took it out pretty well, and I think there wasn't a huge big mistakes.
Q. Tell me about the conditions out there.  Obviously there was a lot of rain this morning, but what was it like for you out there this afternoon?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I thought the weather was fabulous, and I liked the group also.  And yeah, today was pretty good conditions to play.
Q. Everyone's been talking about all those pot bunkers on the course.  Did you find any of those today, and what was the experience like?  Were you able to get out of there?  How tough was the challenge?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I had two bunker shots today.  I had a par-5 after second shot, but the line was pretty good, and the last hole it wasn't really good, but I did pretty good with the lay up shot and I also like how I did the par save on the last hole.
