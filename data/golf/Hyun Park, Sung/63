Q. How did you find the course today compared to previous days?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Less windier than yesterday, so it was not difficult.  But I didn't play well with my putting today, so it's really unsatisfying.
Q. Going into next week, this is a good finish for you.  Does that motivate you for the last tournament?
SUNG HYUN PARK: My score was not that good all the last days, but this time I found my shot and my play was not that bad.  So I could play more with confidence.
Q. This was your first tournament playing at No. 1.  Was it any different?
SUNG HYUN PARK: There's no difference.  Only one thing is different caddie bib color.
