Q. A low score for the second round; you're in a comfortable position at the top of the leaderboard; can you talk about your round today?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Overall, today everything felt really good from tee to putting.  Even though my putting wasn't great yesterday, it was better than I anticipated today.  I'm pretty satisfied with my round today.
Q. The wind picked up a bit during the round; did that affect your play and how?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yesterday, the wind didn't blow even one bit, but it was different today.  Club selection was a little tougher, but we chose well and made a lot of great shots.  I felt comfortable during the round.
Q. Being in Canada and being followed by Brooke's gallery, what was that like?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Brooke is almost like Canada's Tiger Woods.  I was really surprised at how many fans came out to support Brooke today.  To witness that was pretty awesome, and it helped me enjoy today's round.
Q. Did it remind you of the galleries that follow you in Korea?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Laughing) A little bit.  It reminded me of playing tournaments in Korea, and it was really fun.
