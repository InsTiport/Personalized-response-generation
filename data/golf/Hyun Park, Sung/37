Q. So Yeon, the pressure you guys faced this week in your home country is something that other players I think can't relate to.  How was your team able to respond?
SO YEON RYU: Well, we never really feel nervous or something before a major, but we've just been nervous for like a couple months for this tournament, and we really actually were worried about it because we were really worried about how to deal with this pressure, but it turns out because this is home field, we felt more comfortable, and because so many fans came out to support us, I think we had a lot of benefit.
Q. I.K., you were essentially the clinching player today.  Could you have scripted this story book ending for team Korea any better?
IK KIM: I don't know, but I just wanted to have fun, and I wanted all of us to have fun today because there were so many fans out here that came from practice round to support us, and I just had to keep telling myself, focus, focus every shot because I couldn't focus, but I really had a blast, and thanks for everyone to give us such a great match.
Q. Talk about the pressure of playing in this versus a normal tournament.
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I think not only myself but all my teammates felt a lot of pressure coming into this event.  I'm just really happy that we overcame that kind of stress and we came out victorious.
Q. It was a huge smile when you realized you guys won on 17.  In Gee Chun, what do you have to say about your three teammates this week?
IN GEE CHUN: I want to say love and thank you to them because without them, I couldn't play very well this week.  I was so nervous before starting this week, but So Yeon and In-Kyung and Sung Hyun helped me a lot, so I really appreciate it.
Q. So Yeon, it was billed as one of the biggest things we would see on the LPGA Tour, the crowds here.  They certainly delivered today.  What do you have to say about the support here in Korea?
SO YEON RYU: Well, incredible.  I'm so fortunate to be in Korea.  Like I love to see all the Korean golf fans who just love golf so much, and without their support we cannot really have a nice tournament in here, so I'd like to thank them.  I just cannot thank them enough.  So hopefully some day we're going to come back here and then I will see them again.
