THE MODERATOR: Welcome back to the media center.  We are very honored to have with us 2017 CP Women's Open Champion, Sung Hyun Park, who I have selfishly named Queen of North America.  She is the reigning champion of the U.S. Women's Open and now the Canadian Women's Open.  Congratulations Sung Hyun.
13-under overall.  How do you feel?  I'm sure you're very excited?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I can't think of anything.  I can't believe this.
Q. You were bogey-free today.  How can you feel playing on the golf course?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I think it was a perfect game today.  Everything was -- there were no mistakes today, and I think it was perfect.
Q. When you were on the practice putting green, did you know what was happening on the golf course with In-Gee so close to you?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I was waiting for In-Gee.  I didn't know what happened to In-Gee, so I was preparing for the games that happen after.
Q. Congratulations.  You're a rookie on the LPGA Tour this year, but certainly you haven't been playing like one.  How have you been feeling so confident on the golf course this year?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I think this golf course fits my game.  My shots and putting was good.  I think this week was just perfect for me.  That's how I got the confidence on this golf course.
Q. Overall on the season as well, you feel very comfortable?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yeah, I just feel comfortable on this golf course.
Q. Overall for the season?  All year long?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Because I am a rookie, I don't really worry about every shot.  I just did every shot with confidence.  My confidence made me do well this year.
Q. You may not know this, but Se Ri Pak nearly won this event here nine years ago.  She finished second.  I would like you to talk about the influence of Se Ri Pak and about being better than her at this particular course?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I started golfing in Se Ri's generation.  I'm still a part of the Korean Golfing Society.  I also practiced based on Se Ri Pak's performance, and I feel she's a teacher.
Q. So you learned a lot from Se Ri growing up?  She was a role model?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yes.
Q. Do you know Se Ri?  Have you talked to her at all?  Have you ever met her?
SUNG HYUN PARK: We have the same management company at this moment.  After the U.S. Open, Se Ri Pak called me in person to say congratulations for my U.S. Open ceremony.
Q. That had to be a wonderful feeling?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yes.
Q. You came from four strokes back from the leaders today.  Did it make it easier to come back like that instead of being the leader?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I feel a little nervous when I play in the last group.  But I was not today.  Today I was in the top group when I started, so I felt a little more comfortable when I played today's round.
Q. You said you're going to take the next two weeks off.  What are you going to do?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm going to Orlando for two weeks vacation.  I have a dog.  It's been a while since I've seen my dog, so I'm planning to play with my dog during my vacation.
Q. What is your dog's name?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Ato.
Q. How do you spell that?
SUNG HYUN PARK: A-t-o.
Q. Is that a Korean word?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yes.
Q. What does it mean?
SUNG HYUN PARK: It means gift.
Q. What will you do in Orlando?  Will you be going to Disney World?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I've never been to Disney World.  I think I've got to go this time.
Q. You mentioned you got a call from Se Ri Pak after the U.S. Open.  Are you expecting another phone call?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm not sure.  Se Ri Pak's always so busy, so maybe.  I'm not 100% confident, but we'll see.
Q. Thank you so much.  Congratulations.  Enjoy your time off.  We'll see you next year.
