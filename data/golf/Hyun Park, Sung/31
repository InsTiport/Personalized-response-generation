Q. Good final round?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I didn't think so.
Q. How was the round?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I was hitting really well today actually but despite that, I lost a lot of birdie opportunities.  I think that's what's really biting at me now.
Q. Was it the greens, the putting?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I would say it was the putting that wasn't so strong today.  I was misreading lines and distances.
Q. What was the most crucial birdie you lost?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I had a lot of short putts that I didn't hole, like for No. 1 and No. 2, and at 11 I 3-putted a short putt, as well.  Then No. 16, it was a really difficult hole and there was just a really short putt left, but I didn't manage to hole that putt.
I really, really wanted to win today.  As I mentioned earlier, this was a course I was confident with and in the past had scored very well here, and I really wanted to win.  But today I wasn't able to bring my A Game.
The best scenario for me would have been to simply win.  The World Ranking, it always changes, so that wasn't really a big factor.  But once you win an event, that lasts forever, so I think winning was more important for me.
This season, I wasn't really satisfied with how I was hitting, but I think this event, I was hitting really well.  I managed to recover my confidence, and going into the following events, I look forward to the following events.
Q. It's been a long time since you've played through a long stretch in Korea.  How was that like?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I was kind of fascinated by the support I got, and of course I'm grateful.  I just wish I had responded to my fans with better results.
I'm not sure whether I'll return to this course when it's part of the KLPGA event next year.  We'll have to see.
