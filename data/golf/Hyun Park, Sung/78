 Q.  What was your reaction there on 18 to the shot you almost holed?  What are you thinking?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Well, to be honest with you, I feel like some load off my chest.  And I was a bit frustrated my first two rounds, but it was sort of a clear shot for those two rounds.  And I am probably more excited about tomorrow and anticipation is raised.   
 Q.  What was it on the back nine that started going right?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I think my putting worked especially good on the back nine.  I think that definitely helped.  But that was the case for the first two rounds, as well.   
So tomorrow, even if I do not have the greatest start, I can count on probably my back nine with the good putting.  That's kind of what I'm thinking.   
 Q.  Right near the top of the leaderboard.  Do you feel any extra pressure?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Well, I went through a similar thing last year.  So rather than worrying about that, I will try to focus on my game.  That's what I'm going to do.   
 Q.  What did you learn from being in this experience last year that can help you here this week?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Last year I came here as, I guess, a nonmember.  But, however, I got very valuable experience, playing there last year.  So I think that kind of provided me the solid ground to come back here.  And with that experience and learning, I hope that I will have a good finish.
