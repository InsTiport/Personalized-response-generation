SUNG HYUN PARK: So I think my putting worked really well today and my chip shots around the green as well.  It was a little tiring with the rain but I'm glad to have ended the day on a high note.   
 Q.  How do you adjust to the changing weather throughout the day, heavy rains when you started and the rains went off and on and got windy throughout the day.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I preferred the rain instead of having a lot of wind and as soon as it started rain there was less wind, so, yeah.   
 Q.  On 14, you had a bit of a hiccup.  Were you at a refocus and on 15 pick up a key birdie to finish at 2-under.  What did you tell yourself going into the final par 5 of the day to pick up that birdie?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So before I made that double bogey I was 3-under but it was still the 1st Round and there were still a couple more holes left and I knew that I could make more birdie chances.   
 Q.  So coming into today's round, you being the defending champion, was that in your mind during the round today at all?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So, I didn't really feel a lot of pressure being the defending champion, it was just the 1st Round and the weather was bad and everyone is probably missing shots so no, I didn't feel that much pressure.   
 Q.  A lot of commentators and a lot of people say your swing is really pure, you hit it straight and accurate.  Do you think that is an advantage for you because the course is playing long?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It definitely is a long course but I believe that people, players who are strong in their long game have -- definitely have an advantage and definitely make a lot of birdies chances, I'm confident that I'll do well.
