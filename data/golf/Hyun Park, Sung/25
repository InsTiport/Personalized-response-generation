Q. You bogeyed the final hole, but a 3-under opening round.  You have to be pretty happy with your performance today?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So overall, I'm pretty satisfied with today's playing.  I had a strong finish, even though I bogeyed the 18th hole, and I think I had a miss choice on second shot, but overall, I'm pretty happy with my play today.
Q. What club did you take for your second shot?  You ended up in the bunker over the back of the green on 18?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I used a 9-iron and I just misread the wind.
Q. You speak about the wind.  What were conditions like today, and was the course playing fairly fast?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So some holes, there were some swirling winds, so it's a little hard to like read.
Q. You had a lovely eagle on the back nine.  Can you talk us through that?  What club did you hit for your second shot, and how long was the eagle putt?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So after the driver, I used a 17-degree hybrid that made my two on the green and then there was 220 metres, so that's when I used 17-degree hybrid.
After that, it was 16 to 17 metres to the eagle putt, and right after I did the eagle putt, I felt pretty good, confident that it would go in, and it went in.
Q. You have your Namdalla fan club, they follow you wherever you play, and they are big in numbers in Korea.  Here today, you've had maybe 20 of them following you.  What does it mean to you to have such loyal fans?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So it's really supporting me, even though the fact that it's really hot here, and they just come all over from Korea just to see me and cheering for me in this hot weather and they giving me the snack and just them being here just makes me focus on the game more.  Makes me happy.  Helps my game.
