 Q.  Itâs your 10th week as the No. 1 player in the Rolex Rankings. How are you feeling heading into this week?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I prepare for every tournament the same way, nothing special. Iâve found myself comfortable this week from the practice round. I feel pretty good.   
 Q.  How do you feel about this golf course?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: This course has some slopes. I think I have to be careful reading the wind. The wind swirls here. The green have some undulation too. Because of the grain of the green, I need to be more considerate with short putting.   
 Q.  What is your goal for the rest of the season?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I want to have one more win!
