SUNG HYUN PARK: I just tried to play my own game and stay focused on what I had to do.  At the end of the day, I just had to focus on what I had to accomplish.  It was a rough day out there today.   
 Q.  What do you feel like was the biggest challenge for you out there today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: There were a bunch of fairways that I couldn't miss, so that was something that I am disappointed in my shots today.  But I had a lot of great play, a lot of good aspects in my game today, so I'm just going to focus on what I need to do for tomorrow.
