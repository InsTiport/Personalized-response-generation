Q. You had a red hot start today, four birdies in the first six holes, three bogeys around the turn.  How would you sum up your day out there?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So if the first nine holes, everything went well.  I'm really happy how I played on the first nine and with a nice flow.  However, it was difficult to maintain concentration on the back nine, but overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my play today.
Q. Is the back nine more difficult here than the front nine, or is it just the way the day unfolded, that the back nine was more difficult for you?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I think there are some more holes that it's difficult that I can play than in the first nine holes, and also with the breeze and overall condition today.
Q. You're 4-under for the tournament, 1-under for today, still in a very good position going into the weekend.  You must be happy about that.
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm happy with how I played the first two days, and I think third and fourth round will be more important, of course, and I think if I concentrate more and focus on my play, then I would have a really good result.
Q. Was the course setup a little more difficult today with the pin placements?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I agree that the pin placement was very difficult, and also hard to play on the green, strategy-wise.  I think that's why many players are having difficulty playing the short putts.
Q. They call this Asia's major championship.  What would a victory on Sunday here mean to you?  What would a victory in this tournament on Sunday mean to you?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm aware that this tournament is pretty big, like one of the Asia major championship, and if I win on Sunday, then I think I will have a really good and comfortable start of the season, and also, I will get more confident.
