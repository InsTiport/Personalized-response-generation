Q. Do you just want to sum up your day for me out there?  You had a good round, bouncing back from yesterday?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Today was a satisfying round.  I had so many birdie chances there, but I couldn't make them.  But it was quite satisfying.
Q. Only one more round.  You're only a few shots back from the leaders.  Feeling any pressure for your third win?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Not at all, actually.  I'll just focus on my play tomorrow.  Every shot and every round, I just think about my shots only.
Q. Can you tell me what happened with the iron yesterday?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yesterday, the ball was behind the tree.  Even though I hit the ball, the club was going to be broken.  Even though I think about that, I hit the ball, and the iron was just broken.
But today it was fixed, so I used it today.
