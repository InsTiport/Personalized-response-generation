Q. I have to ask also about the 18th, that fourth shot.  It's a nervy golf shot.  Water all the way down the right shot.  Talk us through that fourth shot knowing that if you got it on the green you had a great chance at this championship?
SUNG HYUN PARK: When I was about to hit the fourth shot, I have to be honest with you, my mind went blank.  But my caddie just kept assuring me, you know, you've played this hole.  You have done this one before.  So he just assured me, so I calmed down and did my shot and when it went in, I was pleased myself, too.
Q. I can only imagine.  Of course it's time to present you with the trophy.  Here to present is the president with the United States Golf Association, Diane Murphy.
DIANE MURPHY: Congratulations.  You played beautifully.  You should believe in yourself and your caddie.  We couldn't be more proud of you.
SUNG HYUN PARK: Thank you very much.
Q. There is a tradition with the United States Golf Association since 1895, a Gold Medal is awarded to the winner, so it is my pleasure to now present to you as the 72nd U.S. Women's Open Champion this Gold Medal.  Congratulations.
Also the coveted U.S. Women's Open trophy.  Congratulations.
SUNG HYUN PARK: Thank you very much.
