 Q.  Just how have you felt through two days here in Scotland?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So it's pretty new to me for this open links course, but I think it's fun to do links course here with the hills.   
 Q.  What's kind of the strategy for you on this type of course?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Because the fairway is very thick, I think it's pretty important to focus on how to get to the green right away.
