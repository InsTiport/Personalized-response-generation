 Q.  Great final round, Sung Hyun to pull off a 4-under on Major Championship Sunday.  How would you rate your play today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So overall I think I did pretty well.  Some of the birdie putts, short putts, birdie putts that I missed were identical.  Overall, I think I did good.   
 Q.  To pull off a birdie on 18, how relieved were you, how did you feel after that?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So there were a lot of putting that didn't go in but I was really glad to make that birdie putt on 18.  I wasn't too nervous when the game ended.  I think I would like to congratulate Hannah Green.   
 Q.  How would you rate Hannah's play this week, her first Major win, second year on Tour?  What comments do you have to say about her game?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: How am I supposed to rate a player who has won a Major?  I think she's played a very good four rounds all four days and I'd like to congratulate her on her win today.   
 Q.  (Question in Korean.)  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So going into the 18th I total felt I really have to make this birdie and also thought talked the my caddie.  He said it would go in.   
There were some birdie putts that I missed but I knew that I would make this one and I had a pretty good lie as well.   
 Q.  (Question in Korean.)  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So the putt for birdie putts on 7th and 12, if I look back are kind of regrettable I wish I could have made those.   
 Q.  (Question in Korean.)  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So there are definitely numerous putts that I wish I could have made but now that I think about it they're in the past and nothing I could have done.   
 Q.  (Question in Korean.)  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So, the next two weeks I'll be competing in two tournaments and after that I'll have two weeks off where I'll take time to get prepared for the Evian Championship.
