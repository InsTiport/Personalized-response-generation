Q. Can you talk about your round?  What was working for you today?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Even though my round was bogey-free I still feel like I left a lot of shots out there.  Putts weren't dropping as well as I want them to; neither were my iron shots.
Yeah, still feel like there was some still left in my round.
Q. Could you talk about the differences between yesterday in the wind and today in the calm in the morning?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Compared to yesterday the wind conditions were a lot calmer.  Other than that, the green speeds, because they were a little drier this morning, putts were rolling faster, ball was rolling faster.
So, yeah.
Q. Some of the tee boxes were moved up also today.
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Compared to yesterday tee boxes were moved up, which didn't really affect play comparing to conditions like last year.  Didn't really affect anything today.
