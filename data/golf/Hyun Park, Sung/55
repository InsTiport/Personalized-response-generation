Q. How did you feel compared to last week and what about your game went well for you today?
SUNG HYUN PARK: My tournament ended early last week, so I had a ton of chances to rest and practice for this week.  Overall, I had a lot of great shots and putts today.
Q. How are you going to prepare for tomorrow's round?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I have an early tee time so, I'm going into it and taking it as a new day. I don't think I'm going to change anything really for tomorrow, if I just maintain how I felt today going into tomorrow, I think I'll be good.
