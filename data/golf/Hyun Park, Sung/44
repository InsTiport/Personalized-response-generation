 Q.  How would you describe your round out there today?  Seemed to be a little bit up and down.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Overall, I thought the round was okay.  I had a couple bogeys, so that was pretty disappointing, and a couple misses on pars.  But I still have one day, so I'm going to focus on that.   
 Q.  How different was the weather today versus yesterday?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: It was cold this morning, and that made it a little tough to get out there.  But on the back nine, it warmed up, and so it got a little better.   
 Q.  How about the strategy going into tomorrow?  You'll be a few shots back of the lead but still a great chance to win this golf tournament.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm in a good position, a couple shots back from the lead.  I'm just going to take it shot by shot, and I still have one day left.  I think just focusing on that is going to be most important.   
 Q.  Do you have any nerves trying to defend a title?  Does it make you nervous at all?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Not really.  I don't really feel nerves or anything.  I feel like I shot really great rounds 1 through 3, and so I'm in a comfortable position.
