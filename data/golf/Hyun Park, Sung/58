 Q.  A little bit of a difficult round today.  What was the biggest challenge for you out there today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  The tee shots weren't quite solid, and so I think there were a few misses there.   
 Q.  Were you feeling a little bit tired or just a little off?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  No, not quite.  I think that over the course of four days there is always a day where I'm not quite in tip-top shape.   
I think that day might have been today.   
 Q.  Why do you think that happens, that you have a day like that?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I think it's about really trying to keep your focus all four days.  Keeping your focus is not that easy to do consistently over four, and so I think there is always one day where my focus is a little off.   
It's something I'm trying to fix, but I think it really comes down to being able to cover that up and how you cover up that loss of focus.   
 Q.  The sixth hole, what was the biggest challenge there for you?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  So the tee shot off that hole was a bit difficult, and I think that given it's a par-5, should've been a relatively easy hole.   
My fourth shot on the bunker was where I think I struggled a bit.   
 Q.  What's the game plan tomorrow?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I think that it's going to be really important to keep my focus going into tomorrow.  There is a lot of top players right now at the top of the leaderboard.  Keeping my focus will be key.
