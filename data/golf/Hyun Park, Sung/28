 Q.  So you had a very good round today.  Birdies at four of your last five holes.  How did you feel?  It was a very good round.  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I had pretty good feeling when I started today.  I was able to anticipate that I would play really well even though birdie kind of came late in the back nine holes.  But I think that the waiting was worth it.   
 Q.  It was kind of quiet your first two rounds.  Was the wind a factor or what caused you to pick it up today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  So I had a week off before I came here, so maybe kind of needed some time to catch up my game performance.  Of course the wind affected my play as well.   
As a third round goes, it went well.   
 Q.  Tell me specifically about the wind.  We're hearing it's like a two club, two and a half club wind.  How much is it affecting your game out there?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Basically two club is pretty normal, but sometimes it's worse than two clubs.  I find myself difficult back wind than the front wind because it's more -- for me it's more difficult in order to choose a club.   
 Q.  Last question:  what are your goals heading into the final round and into CME next week?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I'm in pretty good position right now, even though there are some few shots ahead from the leader.  I'm doing my best for each shot.   
For the final CME, I really have a feeling that I want to win CME Championship.  This is the week before the CME, so I want to find myself pretty good feeling for the playing.
