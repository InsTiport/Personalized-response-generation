 Q.  How were the conditions today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I really liked my play today, and even though there were a few birdie chances that I missed, overall I am satisfied with today's play.   
 Q.  Only a couple shots back of the lead; what is your plan going forward for tomorrow?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Only one round left, and I'm going to do my best every shot tomorrow, and no matter -- even though I'm not going to win or not, it doesn't really matter, I'm still going to do my best.   
 Q.  Do you think going out earlier tomorrow will help?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Since it's really hot, I think it'll be better to go early on the tee time.
