 Q.  How does it feel to get off to a good start coming off the major championship?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: My feeling today was so awesome.  It was a good start after the major championship winning, and first of all, I need to focus more on the Marathon Classic and want to keep my happiness behind from now on.   
 Q.  How difficult is it to play three or four days after winning a major championship, to come down from that high, I guess?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Back in Korea, I did win a lot, but here especially for the major, I do know the pressure, and also I'm very happy for that.  But currently I just want to focus on Marathon Classic, so it's not a big deal for me to put that beside.   
 Q.  What did you like about the Marathon Classic course that allowed you to play so well, especially in the afternoon?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: My fairway shot wasn't that concrete all the time, but I think I was pretty much satisfied with my other shots.   
 Q.  Who's the most interesting person you've spoken to since you won last week?  Did you talk to the President or anything?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I did not talk with any South Korean President or Prime Minister.  It was just a good deal with me.
