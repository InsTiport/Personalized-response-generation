 Q.  Your sixth victory on the LPGA Tour.  How does it feel right now?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I'm really, really, really delighted and happy with my play today, and I think today is one of the best days that I am playing so far on the LPGA Tour.   
 Q.  Did you think that your first win of the season would happen so quickly?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: No idea, and I'm still nervous.   
 Q.  Last season, beginning of the season in Asia was kind of a struggle.  You started off slow but now looks like you're gaining momentum.  Why do you think it came so fast?  What was different about this year?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So last year, my shots and like overall thing was pretty unstable in the beginning of the season, and I think my training in the last winter really helped me a lot, and it also helped me to be stronger with my play.   
 Q.  Does this change your outlook for this season?  Does this change your goals?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I don't think so.  No change on my goals this season.  I still have four more wins to go.   
I didn't think I would win this fast and I'm really happy.  I used to have a tough beginning in the last years, and this first win so fast, I think I will play really comfortable the rest of my season.
