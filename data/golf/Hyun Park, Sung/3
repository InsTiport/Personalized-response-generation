 Q.  Sitting at 12-under par, 7-under today. You shot 2-under on the front, 5-under on the back, which is your front nine. What clicked for you on your final nine today?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: Overall I think both my shots and my putts were good, and the back nine, I think that there was a lot of luck when I made that eagle but I'm happy with this finish.   
 Q.  Two eagles today, and this course fits your game very well. It's your first trip to Portland. What about the golf course setup has fit your game so well?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So it is my first time in here in Portland, but the weather is really nice. The course conditions seem really nice, too. The green is a little fast, but overall, I think the course is really nice.   
 Q.  What are you hoping to take away from your play through the opening 36 holes heading into the weekend?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: So the first two rounds have been very good. Last week, I wasn't 100 percent satisfied, so I'd like to play a little better this week and I look forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  You've had a tremendous career already. How have you been able to do that? Any surprise at all how much you've been able to win?  
SUNG HYUN PARK: I still think that there's room for me to improve but I definitely do want to win more. But overall, I think I'm doing well.
