Q. How did it feel to get off to a good start?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Nothing different from my usual play.  I think I started off with a really good feel, a lot of good shots, and some good putts.
Q. First time playing this course this week.  What are your impressions so far?  Do you plan to change anything going into the rest of the tournament?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  Today is the second day I played the course.  First day was for the pro-am.  I think the course suits my game really well.  It feels good.
There is a little bit of a bounce on the greens, but I think I can play well in the next rounds.
Q. How does it feel playing next to Shanshan and Lexi at the tour championship?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  They are players that I played with before, so nothing particularly different today.  It was fine.
