Q. 6-under, first round.  How did you feel overall about your performance today?
SUNG HYUN PARK: As the score says, it went pretty well, and I really liked how it felt when I did that.
Q. What was the golf course playing like today?
SUNG HYUN PARK: The course was pretty wet today, but I felt pretty comfortable today, and I know that it's going to be hotter and difficult as the round goes.
Q. How is it playing in majors?  Is it different from a normal week or the same?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Of course it's a major tournament and I'm getting more nervous, but I'm doing my best.
Q. You've had a really up-and-down year; when it's down, what's not working, and why is it different this week?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I felt like something little was missing, especially my putting, but this week I feel pretty comfortable and confident.
Q. What did you change?  What did you find in your putting?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I changed my putter, and I made some change in the putting routine.
Q. What kind of putter are you using, and what kind are you using now?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I used to use the TaylorMade Spider and changed it to Black.  It was 34 inches, and now it goes to 33.
Q. It's still TaylorMade?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yes.
Q. There are a lot of long hitters on the leaderboard; how did the course set up, and how comfortable were you playing this course?
SUNG HYUN PARK: I agree that the course is long and difficult, and I think it's pretty big benefit for the long hitter.
Q. How much were you able to hit your driver?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Every hole except one hole.
Q. Most of the time on a soft golf course when it's wet like that, in the afternoon the greens get bumpy.  How were the greens this afternoon when you played?
SUNG HYUN PARK: It wasn't as bumpy as I thought, so I felt pretty comfortable during it.
Q. So what was the hardest part of today for you?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Some holes were difficult on the tee shots.
