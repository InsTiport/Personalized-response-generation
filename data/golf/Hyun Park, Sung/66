THE MODERATOR: Sung Hyun, 4-under round today; some pretty good golf by you.  Good scramble five on that last hole after the drive went way right into the hazard.  Assess your round, and how satisfied were you with it?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I think the last hole will be etched in my memory for quite sometime.  I'm happy that I managed to finish well.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with my game today.  I finished 4-under on the front nine.
I thought I would keep the momentum on the back nine, but I think my putting was a little bit off compared to the front nine.
THE MODERATOR: The wind seemed to pick up when you stood on the 18th tee.  Was the wind much of a factor in the drive going right?
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I have to say I think the wind was a factor.  When I got up on the tee box on No. 18 I felt the wind was stronger, and I hesitated a little bit.  I thought that in that case then the landing area for the ball to drop becomes small.
I think what I feared became a reality because I hesitated, and the ball ended up a little bit more right.  So, yes, the wind did have an impact on that last hole.
THE MODERATOR: Heading into tomorrow's round you're alone in second place.  Very good position to push on for your third LPGA Tour win of the year.  You must be very happy with that.
SUNG HYUN PARK: (Through translation.)  I think I will be very nervous when tomorrow come.  I'm not that far behind the lead and it will be the last round.  I'm sure the competition will be tough.
At the same time, this is an event that I really want to win.  I mentioned earlier it's an event held by my main sponsor.
