Q. Excellent first round to your week this week.  How much did you enjoy the course and how much is it playing to your strengths?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I've played on this course back in 2016, so I'm very familiar with the course and comfortable with it.  David, my caddie, helped me a lot today, especially on the putting green.  It was hard to see the lie, but he helped me a lot, and I'm glad to have a good start at this major championship.
Q. It's been a very busy spell.  How fresh do you feel?  How ready are you for another major week?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I was actually a little worried having to play two majors back-to-back, but it's better than I thought.  I've been able to focus, and I feel good about going into this tournament.
Q. Now you get some rest before a late tee time tomorrow; important to have a good first round, especially going out early today?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So it's been a while since I've played this early.  My tee time was at 7:03 this morning, so I had to get up very early, so today afterwards I plan to go back to my hotel and rest some for tomorrow.
