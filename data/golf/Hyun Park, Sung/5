Q. 67,70 to start here at the AIG Women's British Open.  How are you feeling about your start to the week?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I've had good first and second rounds.  There were definitely less birdies today and I missed some, but overall I think it was a good round.
Q. How do you feel about this position heading into the weekend?  Would you rather be leading or do you kind of like to be chasing from behind?
SUNG HYUN PARK: It all really depends, but the players are definitely more nervous, so I think there's less pressure if the middle of the leaderboard.  But of course, I hope that there isn't that much of a difference.
Q. What's your game plan for the weekend?  Anything that you want to work on heading into these final rounds?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So everything that I discuss with my caddie has been going well, but the weather will definitely be important going into the third and fourth rounds.  That may change things, but I will try to be patient going into the third and fourth rounds.
