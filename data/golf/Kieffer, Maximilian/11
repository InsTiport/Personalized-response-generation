 Q.   10‑under par for two rounds is very good scoring.   Is any particular aspect of your game been responsible for that?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, my driving and iron shots were really good today.   So that was the key.   The rough was pretty thick, so if you hit good drives and you get in the fairway, you have a good iron shot in.  
   
 Q.   What about the way the golf course played compared to yesterday?   
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Tougher I think.   There was a bit of wind here today, so maybe I would say one or two shots tougher than yesterday.  
   
 Q.   This is your rookie season on Tour, you started with a fourth place finish in South Africa.   How much confidence did that give you?   
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   A lot.   The onus is on you when you come from The Challenge Tour and everyone is saying when you come from the Challenge Tour, you still have won enough but you still have to prove it, and so yeah that was a big confidence boost.  
   
 Q.   How good of a training ground is the Challenge Tour for the main tour?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Oh, it's a great training ground.   If you look at the leaderboard, there are so many guys from The Challenge Tour now.   It's a new world in professional golf, so Challenge Tour is preparing you perfect for The European Tour.   
   
 Q.   You're from DÃ¼sseldorf, Martin Kaymer is from DÃ¼sseldorf; has he been an inspiration to you?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, obviously.   A couple years ago when you looked at winning majors and stuff and No. 1 in the world, it looked like it was so far away and now imagine and think, okay, now, I can even do it.  
   
 Q.   Feeling good about your position going into the weekend, chance to win this great championship.   
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, I'm just trying to enjoy it now, and the game is good.   So I'm just trying to do the same tomorrow like the last two days.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts after two days of this great competition?   
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, I'm 10‑under, very happy.   I played very good, iron shots were really good.   I even left a couple of shots on the putting green, but I guess that's the game and yeah, I'm very pleased.  
   
 Q.   And conditions were trickier to say the least today with the wind and change in temperature?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, it was tricky today.   Definitely more wind today and then it changed a bit during the back nine, so it was one or two shots at least tougher than yesterday.  
   
 Q.   I know we touched on this yesterday but are you feeling comfortable in this company?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, it's great.   Every day you get out here, and there's so much motivation, also.   Every day you see those great players next to you on the range and you feel like you're so close of also becoming a really good player, so it's great motivation.  
   
 Q.   It was a year ago that pretty much, not quite to the day, but when you won in India, wasn't it?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, it was.   I was actually, if I would not have gone in this week, I would not have played India I think.   Yeah, I'm keeping an eye on what they are doing in India, how the German guys are playing.   
   
 Q.   Tell me what a good grounding it is to play in The Challenge Tour, how does it prepare you for this tour?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Challenge Tour is perfect preparation for European Tour.   I mean, if you look at the leaderboard here, there are so many guys from Challenge Tour up there, and, yeah, the standard is already so high out there and it's a new world when you get in professional golf, so Challenge Tour is preparing you very good for The European Tour.   
   
 Q.   And is that an inspiration in itself, as well, just knowing what others have achieved?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, for sure, if you look how well those guys from Challenge Tour did, if it comes through there, you are good enough to compete out here.
