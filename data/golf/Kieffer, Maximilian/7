Q.   New course record here, sum that one up from your point of view.   
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   It was an unbelievable day.   It was tough out there.   It wasn't easy.   But I played nice.   When I hit a bad shot, I got a good break and holed some putts. 

Q.   You made a birdie at 15.   Tell us about the second shot. 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   I think 210 metres to the flag, a little fade with a 2‑iron and just landed perfect.   If I hit another hundred from there, I won't get it that goes again.

Q.   How much links golf have you played? 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   I played quite a lot as an amateur, like all the big amateur events, but on The European Tour, we don't play that much.   But I enjoy it.   I wouldn't say I'm really good at it because I didn't grow up on it.   I grew up more on the parkland courses but I enjoy it because it's something different.   You need to think a little bit about it.   It's nice to have something different from every other week. 

Q.   A 65, what was key to that round today? 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   Holing a lot of putts and when I hit a bad shot, get a good lie in the rough I guess, and so I mean, obviously I played very good, but you need a bit of fortune, as well, and I had that today.

Q.   With plenty of high points but the approach to 15 was really special?
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   Oh, yeah, it was.   I think I had 210 meters to the flag in the wind off the left and hit a 2‑iron to nine feet.   I said to my caddie, I could probably hit another hundred from there and wouldn't hit it that close again.

Q.   You went very close to winning a European Tour title in Spain two years ago.   What would winning The Irish Open mean to you tomorrow?
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   It would mean a lot.   It would change a lot, definitely. 

Q.   Thoughts on getting a new course record? 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   Actually I think first day was also course record, is that right? 

Q.   And you've bettered it by two. 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   I didn't know that one on the first day but we knew it yesterday because somebody said Tyrrell Hatton put a new course record in.   I said to my caddie:   We are 5‑under; we have to shoot 6‑under tomorrow.   At that stage I didn't think it would happen but I'm obviously very happy that it did.

Q.   What was working today in particular?
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   I played very good, and I holed some very, very nice putts.   My putting was very good and I had the luck you need, as well, because you hit bad shots in those conditions, and today I had the luck that I got a way with them.

Q.   Are you proud of yourself the way you've battled?   Because yesterday was horrible in terms of, what, three double‑bogeys on the card, as well? 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   Yeah, I'm very proud.   I didn't play that bad yesterday to be honest.   It was very tough and it was a really long day, rain, and then sunshine again, rain and it was just very tiring the whole day.   I just got really tired in the end but I hung in there actually quite nice and on 18, I relaxed too much a bit because I thought 18 is an easy hole and I relaxed and made a double there that shouldn't happen.   But I'm obviously quite happy that I turned it around today. 

Q.   Do I hear exactly that you've got a link with Royal County Down, that your coach knows the place well? 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   Yes, he's a very good friend of mine and he used to be the assistant coach here for a few years, so it's very nice that he showed us around in the practise round and obviously it's a golf course where the local knowledge helps a lot. 

Q.   So he's told you where to hit it, as well, on some of these blind holes? 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   Yeah, he gave us all the lines from the tee and the spots where not to hit it and it just gives you a bit more confidence when you know from the first time when you are there in the practise round, you know where to hit it I guess. There were a lot of guys out here this week in the practise round this week going,   where do I have to go here.   
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.   The crowds are great and it's great fun to play in front of such great crowds on that nice golf course.   I think it's going to be a very fun, challenging day tomorrow. 

Q.   Happy with the day?
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   Any time you shoot 6‑under, it is fun to play golf, and a course like this, it's obviously very tough and then in front of all the great crowd, and it was great fun, yeah. 

Q.   Is this your first visit to Royal County Down this week?   It looks like a course that fits your eye?
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   Yeah, it is my first visit.   I had a friend of mine used to be assistant coach here, so he showed us a bit around the practise round.   That definitely helped a lot because you have to know where to go.   It's very tricky.   But yeah, like you said, I really‑‑ there are courses that suit your eye and some that don't suit your eye.   I really see the shots and that helps.
I played a lot of amateur events links golf but we didn't play much the last few years on The European Tour, but I enjoy it because it's something different.   It's obviously different than parkland golf, and you have to think a little bit more whether you will bounce it, and not look at the number and hit it.   I quite like that. 

Q.   Looks as though SÃ¸ren will hold the lead.   What would it mean to win The Irish Open?   I would imagine it would change a huge amount for your career. 
MAXIMILIAN   KIEFFER:   It would be obviously.   There are a lot of benefits that come with a victory and it will definitely mean a lot for sure.   I think my game is ready, yeah, and I feel like I'm mentally ready as well.   But is it good enough, I don't know, we'll have to see tomorrow.
