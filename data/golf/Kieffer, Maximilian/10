 Q.   Tell us about today, how good was that?   
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, it was a good day, 3‑under par, and yeah, I didn't play that well like the last two days, but had some good up‑and‑downs and in the end I made two nice putts, 17, 18, so that was a good finish.  
   
 Q.   Is it one of those days where you take the satisfaction of hanging in there?   
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, it's new for me, being in contention in a European Tour event.   I just made one bogey and I think every day when you only have one or two bogeys, it's a very solid day so very happy about that.  
   
 Q.   Were there nerves going into the third round?   
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, of course there were nerves but it wasn't too bad.   It's a great venue here and looking forward to tomorrow really.  
   
 Q.   I guess it's a balance, isn't it, between nerves and the excitement, because this is when you're out here for.   
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   Yeah, this is what you practice for, to have the nerves.   It's just a lot of funny think, if you are in those situations where you feel the adrenaline a bit.  
   
 Q.   What's it like playing in this wet stuff, because we don't expect the rain here?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER:   I don't mind the rain that much.   The wind was a bit swirling today again.   That was tricky.   And maybe, I don't know I like it a bit cloudy because the sun is not burning, so the weather was good for me today.
