 Q.  Tight match your thoughts on a tight match against Daniel Brooks.  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER: Yeah, I think we were both maybe a little tired this afternoon.  We were both not on our A Game.  But I think we still managed to make more birdies than bogeys, so it wasn't that bad.  Yeah, I'm just happy to advance.  It was a hard battle.   
 Q.  Looked like a scrappy kind of finish, but you got the job done nicely.  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER: Yeah, he opened the door a few times on the front nine, and I couldn't really take advantage.  I think I was only 1-up and I could have been a few more up.  That made it a bit interesting in the end.   
We actually played good on the back nine until 17.  16, he gave me a shot and then 17, we both bogeyed it but it's not an easy hole.   
I'm just happy now that I advance, and I hope that I get some rest now and fresh tomorrow.   
 Q.  You said about tiredness; is that physical, or mental, as well, when you're involved in battle all day?  
MAXIMILIAN KIEFFER: Probably more mental today, would I say, because this morning, I had a very tough match against Mikko.   I said to him after lunch, "I can't play now, I'm so tired."   
But yeah, if you want to get through here, you're not going to have a great run of golf every single time.  So I'm happy that maybe though it wasn't the best of my game, I still managed to advance today.
