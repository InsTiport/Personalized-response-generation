  ANDREW LOUPE:   Hit my driver pretty solid.   Ready to do it again.

Q.   This is just the start of a long day for you.   You're ready to go right back out.   Is that good or bad?
ANDREW LOUPE:   Yeah, I mean I have no problem with it, you know, play, train, all that.   So 25 holes today.   Got 18 more, ready to rock.

Q.   You haven't gotten in all that many tournaments this year.   Do you feel like every tournament you get in is a great opportunity for you or is there some rust involved?
ANDREW LOUPE:   I think anybody would think that every tournament is a great opportunity.   I love my job, I love this game and I'm just ready to tee it up again this afternoon.

Q.   Andrew, where did you start this morning?
ANDREW LOUPE:   I started on 3 tee.
