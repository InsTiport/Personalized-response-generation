 Q.   You had that problem at 5 and then you had a two bogies on the backside.   Tell me about overcoming that down the stretch.  
ANDREW LOUPE:   You just know it's a tough course and you're going to give a couple away.   There's trouble around every corner.   You really have to keep your head down and keep battling.   You know, Bowditch ran out in front for a second there that kind of, you know, you can get like you're falling behind but it's easy to let one slip out here but, at the same time, you can make birdies out here.   There's short par-4s, downwind par-5s that you can go after.  
   
 Q.   Tell me a little about it your pre-shot routine.   You seem to be very deliberate and I know you got put on the clock earlier at the end of your first round.   What kind of things do you go through?  
ANDREW LOUPE:   Visually, struggling with it a little bit.   Kind of having little bit of trouble letting it go.  
   
 Q.   Do you hear anything from anybody or is it similar to what Kevin Na goes through?  
ANDREW LOUPE:   I don't think it's to that extreme.   I mean when I get put on the clock, it will be fine, just get back up.  
   
 Q.   Looking forward to tomorrow, you're up here in contention.   Tell me about you're looking for to do tomorrow.  
ANDREW LOUPE:   Just wanted to be in contention, you know, playing against guys that are playing a very high level.   This is why you play.   This is why I practice everyday.   I really can't wait.   Really looking forward to it.
