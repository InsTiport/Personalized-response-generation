ANDREW LOUPE: Besides a couple swings, I thought I played really solid.  I thought I played within myself.  Rolled in a few putts.   
 Q.  Have you played this tournament before?  
ANDREW LOUPE: Played two years ago.  Couple different courses though.  But I played Q-School on these two.  It was three years ago, I think, three or four years ago.  So I've been around it a couple times.   
 Q.  Good memories from Q-School here?  
ANDREW LOUPE: Pretty good.  I got full WEB.COM status.  So, yeah, I had a couple good bounces.   
 Q.  You've got La Quinta tomorrow, how do you guys like that?  
ANDREW LOUPE: It's a great golf course.  It's in perfect shape.  Tough to find a blade of grass out of place out there.  A little tight off the tee.  Greens should be firm.  It's not a very long course, you just really have to keep it in play.  Same old, same old, more fairways makes everything easier out there.   
 Q.  Talk about your round today and how you played.  What you did well out there.  
ANDREW LOUPE: Yes, I thought I hit the ball really well, for the most part.  I had a couple swings that I would really like back.  I hit a driver out of bounds on 16.  Managed to save par.  And I hit a 6-iron in the water on that par-3 early on and made double.  Really didn't feel like that bad of a swing, I just got it turning a little bit too much, hit the bulkhead and went in the lake.  But besides that I made several birdies, I thought I stayed within myself for the most part, I got a decent vibe on the greens, was able to have some pretty solid reads outs there.  Wayne kept me patient out there for the most part and we just had a good time.
