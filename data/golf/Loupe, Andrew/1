Q. What's it like being here for the first time?
ANDREW LOUPE: Driving down Clubhouse Drive is absolutely beautiful.  The clubhouse itself is pretty immaculate, I don't think I've seen one like that before.  But it's not my first time, I have played on the Valley Course, which is also a phenomenal golf course.  I played the WEB.COM finals there.  It's a little bit of a familiar feel, familiar grass, but it's an absolutely beautiful place.
Q. You actually won on the Dye's Course, if I remember correctly, right?
ANDREW LOUPE: I did not.
Q. No?
ANDREW LOUPE: No, I won the week before.
Q. Oh, that's what it was.  Okay.
ANDREW LOUPE: But I think I came in 6th.
Q. You did really well.
ANDREW LOUPE: To get my card, yeah.
Q. What's the difference, do you think, having seen both courses now?  How do you feel this course sets up for your game?
ANDREW LOUPE: I like it a lot.  I think this is a good mixture out here, it's a good mix of some longer par-4s and some shorter ones.  Some of the par-5s, just about all of them are reachable -- 9's a little tough to reach.  But I like the fact that a lot of the holes will call for one shot shape, whereas the second shot will call for another, like maybe a fade off the tee and a draw into the greens, which I like to work the ball both ways a good bit, so I think that could be an advantage.
Q. Favorite hole out there so far?
ANDREW LOUPE: Wow.  That's tough.  The last four are great.  I like all four of them.  If I had to pick one, probably 16.
Q. 16?  Awesome.  And do you have your pink shirt picked out for Sunday yet?
ANDREW LOUPE: Nike is sending it to my locker.  It's supposed to be there today or tomorrow, I believe, so it is picked out, I have not seen it yet, but I have trust that it will be one good looking pink shirt.
Q. What's the scripting on that?  What are you wearing that with?  Any bright colored pants, anything crazy?
ANDREW LOUPE: Am I supposed to tell you this?
Q. I have confidence that you're going to be there on Sunday, so, yeah, I want a scoop.
ANDREW LOUPE: I think some gray pants will work.
