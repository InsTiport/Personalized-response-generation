Q.   Well played out there.   A little struggle during the middle of the round.   But you've got to be pretty pleased with your play out there today. 
ANDREW LOUPE:   Yeah, I was.   Completely different day today.   Pebble played very tough.   A lot of wind.   I think a lot of people are struggling.   Some people are playing well though.   See more loose shots.   I think that's easy to do in these elements, a couple 3‑putts that shouldn't happen.   But, overall, really proud of the way I battled there for the last couple hours. 

Q.   There were times out there on that golf course where conditions got really difficult, especially out there at 6, 7, 8. 
ANDREW LOUPE:   It really started humming on 3.   4 was brutal.   6 is a beast right now.   I hit 7‑iron on 7 and it's a hundred yards.   So, it was playing tough. 

Q.   I remember talking to you at the Web.com championship at Dye's Valley.   You had finished, you weren't sure if you had got your card.   I know it hasn't been a great start to your season, but in your sixth event how have things gone?
ANDREW LOUPE:   This week, so far, so good.   It looks like I'm a couple back, right where I need to be. 

Q.   As you look forward to tomorrow, any game plan?
ANDREW LOUPE:   Patience.   Nothing changes. 

Q.   Talk about 8 and 9. 
ANDREW LOUPE:   8 and 9, I hit 7‑iron on 8, 6‑iron on 9.   That was a tough golf course today.
