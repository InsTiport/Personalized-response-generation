Q. How do you sum up your round today?
NINO BERTASIO: Steady start.  Was 3-under after seven, so happy with that.  Kind of struggled a bit mid-round.  Didn't take advantage of the par 5s, 12 and 16.  Made a great birdie on 17 and a weak tee shot on 18, but managed to make a clean scorecard.
Q. Take us through the birdie on 17.  That was a nice way to finish your round, and then saving par on 18.
NINO BERTASIO: Yeah, we were in between irons, between 6 and 7, so if I hit 6, went a little long, so hit a 7 and it was perfect, six feet, pin-high.
Q. Now you're in a great position, not only to win here, but also to qualify for The Open.  So how do you feel going into tomorrow?
NINO BERTASIO: Feeling good.  Main focus is obviously an Open spot.  Played with Bernd today and he's playing really solid, so he's going to be hard to catch it looks like, but yeah, give it a try tomorrow.
Q. How do you balance wanting to win here but also having a focus on The Open?
NINO BERTASIO: Just do your best and whatever happens, happens.
