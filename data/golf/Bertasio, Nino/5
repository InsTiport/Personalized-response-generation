 Q.  Thoughts on the round?  
NINO BERTASIO: Very solid tee-to-green.  I had so many chances.  I had chances all day long and made a couple and only one dropped shot.   
 Q.  In terms of expectations into this week, how did that feel, in terms of practice?  
NINO BERTASIO: I've been practicing really hard after Abu Dhabi where I didn't play that well, and last week, we had some pretty good signs.  I had two bogey-free rounds, which I struck the ball very good and didn't make too many putts.  Greens are tricky last week and the greens are very good this week.   
Just yeah, another good ball-striking week and made a couple of putts.   
 Q.  Tell us about conditions.  They were changeable.  Started to get a bit windy out there.  
NINO BERTASIO: It is starting to get windy.  Looks like it's going to be very windy tomorrow, so it's good to have something in the bank today.   
 Q.  You must be very pleased with that start?  
NINO BERTASIO: Very pleased.  Very pleased with the game and that's the most important thing, just to play well and keep it up hopefully for the week.
