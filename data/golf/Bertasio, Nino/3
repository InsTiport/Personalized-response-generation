Q. Great round, but a slightly disappointing finish for you?
NINO BERTASIO: Well, 18, if you miss the fairway, it becomes a long hole.  It is one of the toughest out there.  Obviously it would have been nice to finish with a 4, but it's still a positive round.  Obviously yesterday everything was quite easy.  I was hitting the ball well.  I had chances all day, and happy with 67 to be honest.
Q. Yet, you have seemed to be finding it quite easy.  What do you think it is about this course or links golf that suits your game?
NINO BERTASIO: Well, especially this week, if you drive it well, you can reach all the par 5s, which I did yesterday.  Took advantage of them and made a few putts.  So if you drive it well off the tee, you're going to get a lot of chances.
Q. Are you feeling quite inspired then about The Open next week and your chances there?
NINO BERTASIO: It is the last chance to get an Open spot, so the motivation is there.
Q. Does that add an undue pressure to your game?
NINO BERTASIO: No, not really.  It's my fourth week on the road, so if I get a spot next week, it's a big bonus.  If not, I'm happy to go home and just relax.
Q. You must be happy about the rest of the weekend with your position on the leaderboard.
NINO BERTASIO: Yeah, of course.  Looking forward to it.  It's good to find a bit of form in these big events.  Yeah, looking forward to tomorrow.
