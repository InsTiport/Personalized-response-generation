 Q.  6-under par 66 to start. Give us your thoughts on the opening round?  
NINO BERTASIO: Very good. You know, obviously every time you shoot 66 on any of these golf courses, you're going to be happy walking off the golf course. So yeah, I think I did the right things around St. Andrews. I stayed on the left side of the golf course, which is very important here, and I missed -- it was kind of funny. I missed a two-foot putt, and after that, I started making, you know, a lot.   
So yeah, crazy game, but obviously very happy with the score today.   
 Q.  Which hole was the hole you missed the 2-footer on?  
NINO BERTASIO: 13, and I started off 10. So that kind of got me a little angry and I think I put a little extra focus on there.   
 Q.  What's your thoughts on the Pro-Am format? Is it something you enjoy? Would you like to see more of it? Have you enjoyed the day and the format out here?  
NINO BERTASIO: Oh, yeah, it was great fun. I was playing with Jamie Donaldson, and he's always fun to play with. We had two great ladies playing with us, and yeah, we had a lot of fun.
