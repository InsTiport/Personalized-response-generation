PAUL ROVNAK:  Did you tee off today?
MOIRA DUNN:
 Yep.
Q.  So with the washed round, how was that?
MOIRA DUNN:
 I think it is okay.  I was over par, so I can't complain.  That was only    I played six holes.  So I don't know if it was getting any better.
Q.  What was it like out there?  Was it just miserable?
MOIRA DUNN:
 It was pretty tough.  It was pretty soggy.  The greens were perfect, that was the ironic part.  It was everything else that got wet.  You know, by the time we got to 15, pretty much the whole fairway was wet.  So it was the fairways and the tee boxes.  The tees were really wet.

So it was kind of frustrating.  You know that that is part of the deal.  But I guess basically we lucked out that they did wash it.
Q.  Is there any advantage having played the holes an extra time?  Playing those six or seven holes an extra time?
MOIRA DUNN:
 Possibly, but, I am assuming they will probably put the third round pins out.  I don't know if they will use the same pins.  I don't even know if they are still trying to do 72 or not.
Q.  The thought is to do 36 on Sunday right now.
MOIRA DUNN:
 Right.  So then they won't change the pins, so I guess there is a slight advantage to play the holes we got to play.
Q.  What do you do the rest of the day?
MOIRA DUNN:
 Probably Just relax and maybe go to a movie or something like that.  Get to bed early for another early wake up.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Thank you.
