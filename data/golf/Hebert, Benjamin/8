Q. You've made a fantastic start here with a 68.
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yeah, it's a very good start.  I'm very happy about this.  My game is in a good way at the moment.  My putting, also.  Need to just work on it a little bit this week and see what happens.
Q. What did you learn about getting back on a links golf course last week, three great s rounds.  It was only really Sunday that things fell away for you, but you've made a good start here?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I like to play a links course, especially here, because again, the driving is very important this week.  I hit today a lot of fairway, also, and it's very important, because if you're in the rough, it's very hard to keep the ball on the green.
Yeah, it's a good advantage for me to hit it well from the tee, and yeah, it's good.  I like the links golf course.
Q. Five birdies on the card today.  Any one of those stand out more than the others?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I'm a bit lucky on 18.  I hit my second shot a bit on the right, and it stayed just short of the water.  And I don't know, five birdies, is still good.
Q. An Open Championship place up for grabs and you naturally missed last week.  How special would it be if you could clinch a place at Royal Birkdale?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: It will be great, but also I'll be probably tired because I already played four weeks in a row, and it may be five.  But no, like I say last week, I never played in a major as a professional, so it's a big objective for me.
