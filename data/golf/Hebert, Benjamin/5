Q. Seven birdies in a round of 6, the last one coming on 18, a brutally difficult hole. Tell us about that one?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I'm very happy to finish but 18, it's a tough hole. It's downwind, so it's pretty short. Yeah, hit a pretty good drive and nine iron and had a good putt, so yeah, I'm happy.
Q. What pleased you most about your play today?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I putted very well today. I work on my putting since the start of the week. I have a private lesson with Mr. David Orr, who is like a big expert of putting. We changed some stuff and he works very well. So I'm pretty happy.
Q. What did you change?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: We change the grip first on my putter because I used like a big grip since a few years now. I change it now for a very thin one and so I have more feeling in the hands, and the roll is better. Yeah, that's good.
Q. You come in here as the highest-ranked Frenchman in The Race to Dubai, a certain amount of expectation and pressure, but support, as well. How do you react to all that?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yeah, I feel good support from the French public. We have only one tournament a year, so it's very important for us to represent this week. We'll see. Today was a bit quiet. Thursday is normal. It's okay.
