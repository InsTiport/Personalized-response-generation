Q. What are your thoughts on a tied fourth place finish at this event?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I'm very happy.  This is my best result on The European Tour, and in one of the biggest tournaments.  So just a big pleasure.
Q. Excitement seeing your name at the top of the board for awhile?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: It was good.  I like this course and I feel very good on it.  Today I played okay.  My putting didn't work well enough to maybe get some better stroke, but it's a good day.  I'm happy.
Q. Presumably you can be so proud of yourself for staying right amongst the leaders all the way to the last hole.
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yeah, sure, but as I say, I play very good, and I only miss a few putts and that's why I'm not maybe leading.  But it was an important day for me, and I'm okay now.
Q. In that big a picture, you've secured your career for next season, as well.
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yeah, yeah, for sure.  There is two more tournaments, and maybe I'm going to change my target now.  Maybe I'm Top 60 for the Race, and yeah, we'll see.
