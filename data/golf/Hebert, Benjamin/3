Q. Thoughts on a 67?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: That was good. I'm pretty happy. Last week was tough. I was struggling a bit with my game. Today was very good from the tee. I'm very happy about that and yeah, 5-under is always a good start. My putting was pretty good, also. Everything all right.
Q. We haven't been to this location in a while. How is it playing out there?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yeah, for me it's better because I prefer this course than the other one. The golf course in pretty good condition now every time and it's a good tournament. I definitely prefer this one. It's a little bit more open. The other one was a little bit more tricky and I didn't feel very good and I didn't play very well in this tournament.
Pretty happy about the change, actually, but yeah, as I said, the course is in great condition. I mean, the weather is perfect, so yeah, I think it's going to be a little bit low, the scores today, but we'll see. There's three more days coming.
Q. You said you were disappointed with the play last week at the WGC. What have you changed in the meantime?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: What I just try to change a little bit, my spirit. It was my first experience in WGC last week and I was a little bit stressed I think, also. The course is not usual course on The European Tour. It's quite long and tricky, big rough and firm greens. It was hard. I was impressed the score of the guys, the winners.
I tried to focus on some stuff with my guys on my staff this week and we just try to manage a little bit my physique, because last week I had like a neck, shoulder at the start of the week, so it wasn't easy. But yeah, we did well I think and we will try to continue.
