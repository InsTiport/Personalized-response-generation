Q. Thoughts on finishing in a playoff?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Well, it was a good week. It's always a good week, go to the playoff. The game was solid. I just -- well, my driving is not very good, so I can't be aggressive from the tee and always playing a little shy. Well, I think it missed me just that this week. It's a very consistent one and I'm still okay.
