Q. 64, how satisfied r satisfying is that?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I'm pretty satisfied for sure. It was not very easy today. I start pretty well, so it helped me to get into the day easily and then I just manage quite well the par 5, and then yeah, I'm happy.
Q. Did you know you were going to like this course when you got here?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yes, because last time I play was four years ago before we change for the other one. I felt right well on this course. I prefer this one than the other one. Yeah, just enjoying the week. Everything all right.
Q. What's good about the Hebert game?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Well, iron shot for sure. My iron shot are great, and putting works pretty well today. Yesterday was a bit frustrating because I had some good opportunity and missed a lot. Yeah, I just try to work on my short game I think is the key here, and then we'll see.
Q. You lost in a playoff in a Rolex Series Event this year. Do you think it might be a chance for revenge with a really good day tomorrow?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yes, we'll see. My chances are looking quite well at the moment. Played well last week and still in good shape today. You never know. I think it's not very easy to win a tournament, anyway. So we'll see tomorrow.
