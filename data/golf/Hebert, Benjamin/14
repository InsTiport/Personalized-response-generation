Q. Carnoustie is a difficult course but you made it look very easy today?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yeah, I think we've been a bit lucky.  It was probably the day, the least windy of the week.  While the course was quite easy in this way, because we were downwind on the pretty hard hole like 18, and for sure it was easier.  But I played great.  I started with three birdies in a row, and it makes me confident for the rest of the day.  No mistake, a little 3-putt on 13, but it was a good day.
Q. Looking forward to going back to St. Andrews?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Sure, I like St. Andrews.  It's a good course.  I like to be there.  I feel pretty good on the course, and it suits me quite well.  We'll see tomorrow.  It will be for sure a great experience to play in this part of the day.  We'll see tomorrow night.
Q. And the Pro-Am, do you enjoy that?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: It was great to play alongside Hans.  He was a good day.  Today was a good day, also with, Pascal and Alex.  It was for sure a good day for me to play with those guys because it was quite relaxed on the course.
Q. Why have your results been better this year?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: More practising is the difference I think.  I think I was more ready this year and quite okay for the card now I think, so I will enjoy the last day tomorrow and the last two tournaments and maybe Hong Kong, we'll see.  But it's a good thing for me.  I'm very happy with this.
Q. Nice to see your name at the top of the leaderboard; have you thought about what it's going to take?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I've played good for one month now and the results are getting better.  ThorbjÃ¸rn looks quite on fire, but in St. Andrews, you can go low, so we'll see.
