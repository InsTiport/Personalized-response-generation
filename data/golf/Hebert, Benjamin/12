Q. 64, bogey-free, as well?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yeah, bogey-free.  I'm very happy because a arrived here with three missing cuts and I was playing bad.  This week I'm happy.  It's okay.
Q. How was the week as a whole?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I start quiet.  The first one, I played in the afternoon and it was windy, not so easy.  I have another bogey-free round in the second round, 5-under and another 5-under yesterday and today was the best day for sure.  I played very well.  I hit the ball very solid.  Putting works well, too, so I'm very happy.
Q. How are the conditions out there?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: It's beautiful.  We know that the course, the players are very good and the scores are very low, so you need to be a bit aggressive and hole some putts.  Because, you know, if you just play like 3-under, you're probably going to lose some spots on the ranking.
You need to be focused on your game, very aggressive, and that's what I did today.  I'm very happy.
Q. How many positives going into the last four tournaments?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I don't know yet if I'm going to play Dubai.  I think I'm going to play in Turkey in two weeks, and in South Africa, too.  I need to train a bit next week and have should good results.  I think that one good result in the next two events, I will be okay for the final.
