Q. Level par this morning. How does that rate in your opinion compared to the round of golf yesterday?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: A little bit the same I think. It was very hard this morning, very cold at the start, and then very windy at the end. So I'm very happy. I didn't lost a point today, so yeah, the way the course is, always good, yeah.
Q. You've had a couple near misses so far this year. What make this is tournament so special to you, and give us the sense of the excitement of the position you are heading into the weekend?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: I'm very happy and very excited about it. Hopefully it's going to be like -- not The Ryder Cup, but some people will come to watch everybody, and yeah, I'm very happy. The course is still very hard. Try to stay on my game, and we'll see.
Q. Seen a lot of people walking down here, not very happy about how it was out there this morning because it was so difficult for you guys, as well. You were in a good group, you played alongside Kurt who played a lovely round of golf, too. How much does that help when you see guys alongside you do some good stuff?
BENJAMIN HEBERT: Yeah, it's helping definitely. Kurt is a very nice man and a very good player, also. He hit it a little bit farther than me, but it helps you to stay focused on your game, and of course, sometimes it helps also with the wind. But it is very hard because there is some gust on the course, so sometimes it's very hard to find a good club and a good way to hit the ball.
Yeah, I managed it quite well, so I'm happy.
