Q. You're a Florida guy, Orlando, Florida State. How different is it playing out here?
HANK LEBIODA: With the conditions like this it's not much different. It's about as perfect as you could hope for, honestly, with the little cool mornings, nice afternoons, very light breezes. The grass is green, thankfully and just try to keep hitting it in the green stuff.
Q. Tell me this, because I admired your game for a couple years. You worked your way through the Latinoamerica, Mackenzie Tour. How did working away through those stages help you now on the PGA TOUR. Obviously that helps.
HANK LEBIODA: Yeah it's part of my developed mental process. I think everyone would love to come out be a Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, even a Cameron Champ who had a season on the WEB.COM and by the end of that year he was a winner on the PGA TOUR. It doesn't happen for all of us. For me the Latinoamerica Tour, Mackenzie Tour both were extremely important for my developmental process and it allowed me to grow as a professional, to compete against guys that I knew that I probably could beat at the time, but still had to go out and do it. Especially Latin America, you travel to places you don't know, you can't really communicate too well -- I couldn't at least -- it made me grow up. It made me grow up and realize I love this job, I love this game, and this is a profession I want to choose. So it kind of got your mind right and it got you in kind of the professional mindset, taking care of yourself and really developing your game to try to get to the next level.
