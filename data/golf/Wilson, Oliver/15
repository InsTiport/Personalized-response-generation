   OLIVER WILSON: I didn't play very well. I played okay, I just didn't hole any putts. I didn't put any pressure on Sergio. He played pretty steady. And at the end when he needed to, made a few birdies to finish me off. So I did feel like I was playing well enough to put on a good performance this week. It was a good week. But I felt like my game was in better shape, and I could get to the final and contend to win.   
 I'm disappointed right now, but I'll move on and look forward to playing the next few weeks.  
  
  Q. Did the change in conditions perhaps throw you a little bit?  
 OLIVER WILSON: I don't think so. It wasn't the change of conditions. We were out there trying to keep up, and we weren't playing sparkling golf. We were leaving a lot on the greens. It was hard to concentrate and try to get the most out of it. It ended up being tough work.   
  
  Q. You've had a good week, yourself?  
 OLIVER WILSON: Yeah, not bad. I improved on last year, which is good. Obviously it's tied 5th or something. But I only got halfway through the week. I'm disappointed with that.
