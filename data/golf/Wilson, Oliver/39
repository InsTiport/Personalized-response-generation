 Q. How does it feel beating KJ Choi, a man 25 places ahead of you in the World Rankings?
 OLIVER WILSON: Pretty good. It is not a good draw getting KJ. It was always going to be tough. He is a solid player tee to green and you are certainly not going to get him riled or anything and beat him mentally. So it was always going to be tough. I played pretty well. Played well on the front, not so well on the back but made some good up and downs. Big putt on 14 kept me two up and I managed to hang on from there.

 Q. How are the pin positions on these greens?
 OLIVER WILSON: There are some tricky ones. Straight away on the first we both went straight for the flag and went over the back. Pitched near the flag and over the back. They are tricky and if the greens dry out they will be tough. But that have been very sensible with the speed. They are not that firm and it is set up good.

 Q. Anthony Kim tomorrow - you have a bit of history with him after coming back from four down to beat him on your Ryder Cup debut - how do you fancy your chances?
 OLIVER WILSON: He has been on a long trip back from Australia so maybe a bit of jet lag will kick in. Again it will be a tough match. You don't have any easy matches out here. I am going to work on a few things this afternoon and look forward to it tomorrow.
