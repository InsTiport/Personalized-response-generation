   OLIVER WILSON: I got off to a great start with a really good first nine holes in which I had lots of chances. I birdied the 10th, my first hole today, and also 12 before eagling the 14th. My front nine could have been a lot better too because my par at 15th came when the ball was in the jaws of the hole and I also missed from ten feet on the 17th for a birdie which would have been great there.

 But my back nine was not as good after a bad bogey on the second. I did birdie the fifth and sixth but bogeyed the 8th and needed a great par on the last to come in a three under. But it was nice to finish that way and all in all I'm very happy.
