   OLIVER WILSON:  Birdied the last which was a nice way to finish. Happy with that. Back nine I was struggling mentally and let a couple of chances go on the par fives. I was disappointed but the birdie on the last brings an end on a happy note.   
 It is hassle with the waterproofs on and off. A couple of shots where it just starts to come down and it distracts you but you have to get on with it.   
  
  Q.  Just one back going into the weekend?   
 OLIVER WILSON:  I am not expecting that much but if I can shoot under par each day I will be happy. I am not setting my target too high and just see what happens and hopefully I can have a good weekend.  This week all I am trying to do is eliminate stupid shots. That has been the problem all year. I have thrown away silly shots. Get rid of those and pay half decent I shouldn't be too far away.
