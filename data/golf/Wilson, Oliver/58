  Q.  Out in 31 - what are you thinking?   
 OLIVER WILSON:  I have worked really hard for this round. Before the week I said I was going to take some time off and I would put everything I had into this round. I wasn;t overly confident going out  but tried to focus on one shot at a time, all the clich√©s. Yesterday I was pretty bad, don't hit it there, don't go left. But I managed to grind a round out. Today I was good, trusted my swing a bit more and it paid off.   
  
  Q.  Were you aware of the situation - you got within two?   
 OLIVER WILSON:  No. I was just trying to pick up a few shots coming in, just for me, playing against the course. I got on 17th, middle of the fairway and sensed I had a chance with all the TV guys right in there. Shame as I thought I played pretty well down the stretch and just a couple of bad pitches into the par fives and didn't give myself good chances. To finish well on the last, getting up and down from 60 yards felt good.   
  
  Q.  Looking forward to a break now?   
 OLIVER WILSON:  I am and this makes it a lot better. I thought after taking a few weeks off I would be a bit nervous but this result makes me more relaxed about it. I will set myself some new goals for the season and see what happens.
