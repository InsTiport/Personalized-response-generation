  Q. Six birdies and no bogeys round the Blue Monster, how does that feel?  
 OLIVER WILSON: Pretty good to be honest. Yesterday was probably one of the best roounds I've played for a while shooting level, I really hung in and ground it out and it gave me a chance to do what I did today so it worked out pretty good.  
  
  Q. Nine shots behind, what was your goal today?   
 OLIVER WILSON: I didn't really have one, I was just trying to shoot a low score,. I wanted to shoot in the 60s. I just wanted to finish playing well, put in a good score and conquer that last hole.  
  
  Q. And you did that?  
 OLIVER WILSON: Yes I made a good four up there. It is a long hole, especially for me going in with three or four irons into that green it can be pretty tricky so I was pleased with two good shots in there today.  
  
  Q. How are you feeling about what is coming up for you in the next few weeks?  
 OLIVER WILSON: Feeling good. I'm not playing loads but I have got a few good tournaments coming up, obviously the Masters is the main one that I want to prepare for but I am looking forward to it, it is my first time there and I'm sure it will be a lot of fun.
