 Q.  In the end, a good bogey at the last for 6-under par.  What was the strength of your game today?  
OLIVER WILSON: It wasn't off the tee.  I guess patience.  I didn't really have much of a game plan going out there.  It's a bonus being here again this week.  It was a little bit different preparation.  I haven't seen the course.  My caddie made a plan and I was literally just trying to get it in play off the tee and look at the book and try to go from there, so he tried to guide me round.   
The weather was awful, range, a bit of breeze and was playing quite cautiously but hit it really well and got off to a nice start.  Birdied the first and 3-under on the front nine, so kind of relaxes you a little bit.  Then I really saw it on the back.  Hit it quite poor but then kept it in play.  Just wasn't hitting where I wanted to.  Birdied the par 3 and made eagle on 13, which catapulted my round forward.   
 Q.  Sounds complicated going out there having not seen the golf course, and literally just relying on the caddie.  Something you've done before?  
OLIVER WILSON: Never.  Never in my career, no.  I wasn't planning on playing last week or this week, so my schedule is a little bit different, and I was really tired.  I had a golf day on Monday, and I was just tired.  I wasn't playing very well.  So we opted to spend Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday on the range grinding my swing out.  I thought if I was swinging it better, then I'd be able to get it around the golf course okay, and I have to say, it worked out well, though there's still some worked to be done.  It worked out good.
