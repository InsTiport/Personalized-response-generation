 Q.  Tell me how you were feeling out there and thoughts on the round.  
LUDVIG ABERG: Well I played great.  There was a lot of color on my scorecard.  I started off with a 7 on No. 9, I had double.  I really, I'm really proud of how I bounced back from all the setbacks that I got out there.  I hit some really good shots, especially the back nine, a lot of wedges, a lot of good wedges, short irons, mid irons, gave me a lot of opportunities.  So it was good.   
 Q.  Any of the birdies stand out in your mind as big ones?  Any long birdie putts?  
LUDVIG ABERG: Yeah, I had a birdie on, what hole is that, the long par-3 by water.  Can't remember what it is.  Hole No. 12?  13?  I can't remember what hole it is.  Yeah, 14.  14.  It was just way across the green, I had the flag stick just stay in and it was a little bit firm, but it just stopped by the flag, so it was a good birdie.   
 Q.  Yeah.  What do you think about Pinehurst so far?  Is this one of your first times here?  
LUDVIG ABERG: This is my first time here.  It's just unbelievable.  Everything that comes with this golf course is just unbelievable.  I'm just very grateful to be here and to be able to be a part of this great tournament.  It's just a privilege to be here to play.
