Q.   How it was? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   It was nice, nice rain last night, and it played softly. 

Q.   What was the key to your round today? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I've never played here before, so I hit good irons today. 

Q.   As you were finishing the winds start to pick up a little bit? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   That's going to happen here, it's usually quiet in the morning and more in the afternoon.

Q.   You mentioned you haven't played since they reconfigured the course how did you like it? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   It's good.   My point of view is if you want to complain go work at the McDonald's. 
People are always going to have opinions about things but I think it's a good change.   A lot of good greens, tough pins out there and if you hit bad shots you get punished. 

Q.   Greens rolling slow because they were wet today? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, and quite sloped and it's windy here, so‑‑

Q.   Probably quicker the next few days? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Probably. 

Q.   When you got out this morning there was almost no wind, was that fun? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, but I don't have much experience playing here, but it was definitely playable for me.   Damp and no winds is nice. 

Q. Good round.
