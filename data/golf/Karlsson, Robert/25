 Q.   4â€‘under par, pretty good, pretty satisfied, or not?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, satisfied.   I came off a really, really nice start.   68 is nice.   
   
 Q.   You just had your 500th event at Wentworth, how special was that?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I mean, when it happened, it probably wasn't that special but now I've taken the time to think back on it, 500 rounds is a long time, so many rounds, and looking back on sort of the first years, that was a really long time ago.   The Tour has changed so much, so it's interesting to look back on it.  
   
 Q.   And how have you change the as a person from the first time you came on Tour to now?  
ROBERT KARLSSON:   A lot.   
   
 Q.   In what way?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   In the beginning, you're very, very excited, just very happy to be out and play.   Now in one way, it's more of a job.   In another way, I know a lot more what to expect and what I need to do, so a lot more experienced.  
   
 Q.   Have you set any targets, particularly for the summer?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I'm trying not to set too many targets on winning tournaments and positions and stuff.   I'm more on the process that I have to do on the golf course, and everything else will take care of itself.
