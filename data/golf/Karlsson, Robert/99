  Q. A lot of low scoring and you certainly capitalised on the conditions today.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, it was very nice to play today compared to the last couple of days. It was a nice day out there.  
  
  Q. And on the home stretch, a great par save on 17?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, I had a chance for birdie on 18, as well but under-read it a bit and didn't hit it hard enough.  
  
  Q. Did you enjoy your golf today?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, it's very good.  
  
  Q. And boosted by your win three weeks ago in Germany?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Definitely it, really feels like it's a little bit closer and in the it back of my mind, so definitely.  
  
  Q. Martin Kaymer has managed to take the lead, where will you watch the rest of the action?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Good for him. He deserves the win. If he pulls this one off -- he's had a tough time with his mother passing away from cancer, so he definitely deserves to get it.   
 I will go try to stay warm somewhere and see what happens.
