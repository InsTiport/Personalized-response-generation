  Q. You are the favourites to win, and the first round is over; what do you think?   
 HENRIK STENSON: It was difficult out there today. It was a lot of wind, it's swirling around, so it's a slightly tougher day on the course than yesterday, that's for sure.   
 We played okay, not our best, that's for sure. I was struggling a little bit. I think we are quite happy, with the first round score, anyway.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about today's competition and what is your plan?   
 ROBRT KARLSSON: Well, today, it's a better-ball format, so just go out and try to make a few birdies out there. Like Henrik said, it was a tough day out there. I think both of us are pretty happy with the 65 and go from here into tomorrow.
