   ROBERT KARLSSON:  This course is always there for the taking if you are playing well. That is just the way it is. I didn't play so well the first couple of days but today I played a lot better and go tit going which was nice. Over all played ell today. Two bogeys, one three putt and one on the 18th but these things happen and it was a good round.   
 The first three or four holes are nice pin positions and downwind and a few guys have got off to a hot start. But the back nine is not that easy but if you are playing well you can score well.   
  
  Q.  Do you think that will be close at the end of the day?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  I hope so. The most important thing is I am playing well and enjoying myself and I will do the best I can again tomorrow.
