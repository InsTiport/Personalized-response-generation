 Q.   Can you talk about your day, finishing with even par?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, it wasn't great, but I wasn't playing very good.   So all in all, it was okay.   It was one of those days that I got quite a lot out of it because I didn't play particularly well.   By the end, I made a couple of clumsy mistakes.   It is what it is.   I would have been happy with a couple under, but that was probably the best I could have done today.  
   
 Q.   And even par right now is certainly right in the thick of it, there's a couple of guys 1‑ or 2‑under, but you're right in it?  
ROBERT KARLSSON:   There's a couple 5‑unders in a major, but even par in a major is usually not too bad, especially if you're struggling.  
   
 Q.   What's the plan for the rest of the day?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I'm going to keep working a bit on the shots.   It's typical, when I played the British Open, you hit a lot of low shots and a lot of steep attacks, try to get the ball a bit more suited to this course than Hoylake.
