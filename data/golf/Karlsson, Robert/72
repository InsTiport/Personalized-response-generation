 Q. How did you manage to shoot a 68 in a howling gale but a 70 in benign conditions?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: This is a tough golf course and it doesn't really matter what kind of weather it is. Yesterday they set it up a little easier because of the winds and I only dropped one shot. Today I dropped four and that is the difference between the two rounds. But I am six under par for two rounds so I have to be happy with that.

 Q. What went on at the 15th where you had an eagle two yesterday?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yesterday was fantastic - I'd like to leave it there!

 Q. Was today's double bogey down to the elements or yourself?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It was a totally different hole today, it was straight into the wind and I hit a poor drive and had to chip out sideways. Actually I had to chip it out twice sideways so it wasn't a lot of fun.

 Q. It is the nature of this game isn't it, it just bites you sometimes even when you're playing well?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I did hit a couple of bad shots today and one of them came on that hole. I was unlucky and I got a lie right up against one of the tree trunks and I had to use the back of my putter just to move it about ten feet. But it is a part of the game and this golf course, if you are not playing well, it can get you.

 Q. Did you anticipate lower scores today than we actually had?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I've been around this golf course enough never to expect anything. It doesn't really matter what the weather is like because the Tour sets it up a bit more friendly when we have windy conditions and today it was tough pin positions out there which made it difficult to get close to them. I am not surprised actually.
