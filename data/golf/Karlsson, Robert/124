  Q. That eagle charged you up?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It was good fun. I missed my drive slightly to the right. I didn't think it would get up.   
 But it was playing so much downhill, so it's like 256 to the flag, but playing that much downhill it was actually perfect for a good 3-wood and I hit it excellent. It was straight on the flag the whole way. So it was good.  
  
  Q. Are you happy with how you finished?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Oh, yeah definitely. Really, really happy with this. It's been a fantastic week and I learned so much from last year and took that with me to this year so really, really happy with this.  
  
  Q. Can you tell us about the conditions, the wind, was it tough out there?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Oh, yes. Well the pin placements were very fair. I think that they did a great job of setting up the course because today you could get out of hand with the speed on the greens and this much wind, but it was all set up very, very fair it was possibly to do a good score out there, so it was good.
