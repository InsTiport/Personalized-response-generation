   Q. Thoughts on the day. Obviously 70 today.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah. It's a good day. It was a little tough to start this late. That's tough. But no, I'm very happy with the round, I played quite well. So it was good.   
  
  Q. Wind play a factor in your game?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: A little bit. Especially around the turn. About 10, 11. And then it calmed down a little bit and then 15 it was quite windy again. So it was up-and-down.   
 I think that from where I started so late in the day I think 70 was a pretty good score, so I'm happy with it.   
  
  Q. Starting late in the day did the golf course change or just getting yourself through to late in the day, a later start?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I was a bit disappointed missing that last putt though because I would probably get another hour in bed tomorrow.   
 (Laughter.)  
 But, no, I holed out a few other ones, so it was nice.   
  
  Q. Do you change now that the weekend is here and you have about 8 shots in front of you, do you change anything?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I've always played this golf course aggressive before and I'll keep doing it. I probably have to be a little bit careful about where they put the pins and things like that.   
 But I pretty much try to play as aggressive as I can and I'm very happy with it.   
  
  Q. What did you feel was your most difficult hole today?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I think it's always 11 and 12, those there.   
  
  Q. Just long, playing long?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, 11 played a little long. I just had a little 7-iron in. I hit that on third shots before, but not on my second shot, so.
