 Q. Pretty good 3-under. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Not bad. Played all right, played all right, nothing spectacular but heading the right way, very happy. 

 Q. It's not easy out there, is it?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It's been on and off, not windy, but the course is long. But it's in great condition. You could see why there would be low scores, as well. It's a great course to play and I enjoy playing here. It's good. 

 Q. A lot of pressure, but great way to start, birdie 3?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It was a little bit, but I pulled the drive, but that's all right. Yeah, it's good, those sort of things, it's a bit of an honour to get it, as well. And to start with a three, from the rough, as well. 

 Q. Are you tired? You've been through a lot recently and you haven't had any time off. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It was nice to get it over and done with, it was great the outcome as well, but last week was tough. It was difficult to keep it going, especially when I wasn't playing that well, and saw that Lee was doing well. 
 But it's great to have it over and done with, and now it's sort of a relief now. So I'm feeling very relaxed and happy to be here.

 Q. Mental tiredness as well as physical tiredness?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, and you get frustrated when you can't do anything about the situation. But it was great, and I was lucky to get away with it and now it's a new season starting and it felt more like a relief to be here and start again.

 Q. Does it feel like a new season?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It does, yeah. I mean, after the Volvo Masters, it's always been the last event. Now it's a new thing starting and it's great for us all.

 Q. This week and then a couple of weeks off? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, then World Cup.
