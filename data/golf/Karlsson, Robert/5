 Q.  A 69, you must be over the moon here at The Open de France?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, fantastic.  I played really nice.  Done some good work with Pete Cowen over the last few days and very happy with the way it feels, so ecstatic.   
 Q.  Just that one hump on the first hole but from then it looked like pretty smooth sailing?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: I worked on the swing a lot and when you stand on the first tee and don't feel that comfortable, it's easy to make a mistake.   
 Q.  What do you think of the changes to the course?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, there's more rough, definitely more rough and it's closer to the playing areas.  There are strips between the rough and where the spectators are there -- it's spectacular.  I think they have done a great job.   
 Q.  Is it a course where bogeys and doubles can come as easy as one another, isn't it?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, definitely.  Especially when you miss the fairway.   
 Q.  I think they might have a harder time this afternoon.  Will that make lunch taste a bit better?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, finished birdie par on 17, 18 and I'm definitely pretty happy sitting in here.
