 Q.   Tell me about your day.   
    ROBERT KARLSSON:   It was quite windy.   
   
 Q.   How are the greens this morning?   Were they as pure as they were yesterday?  
    ROBERT KARLSSON:   They're beautiful.   They started to firm up the last few holes on the back nine.   
   
 Q.   What's your strategy going into tomorrow?  
    ROBERT KARLSSON:   Try to take your chances when you can, and then try to make pars for the rest of them.
