Q.   Your verdict on the day, please?
ROBERT KARLSSON:   A bad start and a big battle to come back.   One of those days I'm very, very coming off with a 71 when I was 3‑over after three holes.   Easy to do here.   I didn't do much wrong.   I hit a bad tee shot on 1 and it just bounced into a little bush.   I kind of left‑handed it out, and was pretty happy to walk off with a five.   Then hit it in the bunker on three and all of a sudden you're 3‑over.   That happens around here.

Q.   Presumably you told yourself, be patient, there might be opportunities. 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, it is, and with Ernie's re‑design, it's slightly different.   You have more chances early on in the round, and from 13 in is pretty tough.   You still have the two last par fives, but they are way tougher than they were a few years ago.   You still have to be patient and just keep going.   Everybody is going to make mistakes.

Q.   Only halfway but were you conscious of leaderboards, your position on it in relation to the leader? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Not really.   I saw Francesco's when I came this morning but it doesn't really make a difference.   The thing is, I was 3‑under, or 2‑under, struggling pretty badly after a few holes.   All of a sudden I was just a couple of shots inside the cut line.   If you miss a few more shots, all of the sudden it's very, very bunched up.   So the leaderboard, you kind of leave that out and just keep playing your game and grind it out. 
A golf course like this, you can't push it too much around here.   If you hit wild shots off the tees, you're going to be punished straightaway.   If you look on a lot of the winners here previously, it has been a lot of players that are very good at keeping the ball in play and putting and chipping well.
