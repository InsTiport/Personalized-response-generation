 Q.  Off to a great start, came to a bit of a halt, didn't it?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: It's not an easy golf course.  If you don't hit it properly, get just a little bit off, all of a sudden it's hard to get close to the hole.  I played pretty similar all day and a little bit of a struggle compared to yesterday.  Pretty good round in all.   
 Q.  18, not a great hole for you this week so far?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: Well, hit bad shots, doesn't matter what the number of the hole is.  That's just the way it is.   
 Q.  It must be nice to be in contention going into the weekend?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: Definitely, definitely.  It's been two good rounds, looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  You have not carded below 70 in 20 rounds, I think, this season.  Is that something you are aware of?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: Those are stats I never look at.  That's something for you guys.   
 Q.  Conditions-wise, what was the difference for you today?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: It was very, very cold when I started.  The ball didn't really go anywhere.  Then after that, the greens today were spinning so much it was ridiculous.  There was probably a little bit more dew on the greens and they were quick in the morning.  So it was tricky to get close to pins.  I had full 8-irons and they spin back eight to ten yards.  It was just ridiculous.  It was tricky.  The course is playing good otherwise, and it's great to be here playing a tournament in England.
