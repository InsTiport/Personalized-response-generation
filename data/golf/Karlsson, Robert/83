 Q. Five birdies in your last six holes; pretty pleasing? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, it was great. I actually played really well pretty much the whole week and didn't manage to knock any putts in in the beginning or the middle of the tournament. 
 It's been a good week, very happy, second week out this year, so very happen with this.

 Q. Two rounds in the middle, 71s, do you feel that's where the tournament got away from you?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, I mean, two 65s, two 71s, it's quite easy to see. But I mean, I played all right. It's just that I didn't really putt well. 
 There you go. You shouldn't complain when you shoot 6-under around here, so I'm very happy.

 Q. Looking at Rory at the moment, he's quite a talent, isn't he. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: He's a fantastic player. Just hope he can keep it together. It will be important for him.

 Q. Looking to the rest of the season, be nice to retain the Order of Merit? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Well, I mean, the important thing is to keep doing what I did last year. I'm not going to focus on results. I didn't do that last year. The important thing is to keep doing what I did last year, so I'm taking it one event at a time.

 Q. What's up next for you?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: A few weeks off actually and then play a couple in America, the Match Play and the Miami one.
