ROBERT KARLSSON: I didn't hit the ball very good, so I put myself in a lot of trouble.  But I managed to keep it together very nicely and I'm very proud of the way I scored in the end.  So it was good.   
 Q.  Bogeyed 8 but straight back with an eagle on 9.  
ROBERT KARLSSON: Obviously those sort of things are things that can swing the round a bit.  I hit it left on a break and the way it was lying, it was good to have a chance to make a par, but I got a bogey -- then I hit a good 3-wood to ten foot, probably 12-foot on nine, and I rolled it in.  Obviously it's very nice to do that.   
Then it started raining and I chipped in on 11.  Obviously the momentum's shifted quite a lot and it was nice.   
 Q.  You had a great par save on 12.  
ROBERT KARLSSON: There was a few of those today, and definitely, that was one.  It was one of those, when I saw how the ball was lying, I was like, at least I have good contact on it, so it was fine.  But I had a funny stance a little bit with the tree right behind me.  Got a bit steep on it and cut across it, so it was fine.   
 Q.  Obviously your experience tomorrow in the final group, what's your plan?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: You've got a potential Ryder Cup player.  Every time you play well, every time you're up in contention of tournaments, it's what we all practice for and what we all play for.  It's fantastic to play here.  It's a great crowd and I'm very, very happy to be in the last group.  It's a long time since I was there.
