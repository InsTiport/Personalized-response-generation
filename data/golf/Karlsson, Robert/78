   ROBERT KARLSSON: Where I am now, I just need to play golf and I need to play tournament golf. Every round I'm going to learn from my mistakes and correct it and go on from there, like after a long winter. It's a bit the same.   
  
  Q. A bit like a long winter?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, a long winter break. You get into sort of the middle of the season, as well where everybody else is still playing, but there we go.  
  
  Q. And next week you'll be defending.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Hopefully I can play a little golf here and not so much next week, per round.   
  
  Q. Not so many shots you mean.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Per round.   
  
  Q. How did you find it out there? Eye all right?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, there's no problem with the eye. Other things was a bit of a problem. They played a bit too good and we didn't play good enough. But match play that's the way it was. They got off to a really good start and all of a sudden from there we just had to hang on and even when we were able to string a number of birdies together, we didn't get anything back because they were birdieing and eagling. They just played very well.  
  
  Q. They were a good combination, weren't they.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: They played really well.   
  
  Q. But do you have a bit around the middle where things almost got going?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, we played better, I think we birdied 6,7,8,9 but we didn't get anything back, we were still 4-down.   
 But if you are going to get into that match, we need to won one or two of those holes, and obviously the beginning when Wally holed on the first and then the second, we got 2-down. If we would have holed on the first, it could have been a different story but there we go, that's match play.   
  
  Q. Good to be back though?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It's good to be back. Today may not be most enjoyable one but one of these days had to be the first.
