Q. What are your thoughts on a 4 & 3 victory over your namesake, having got off to such a good start?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Well, I think maybe he was a little nervous in the beginning and I played good the first few holes.  Obviously it was nice to be a few up.  It's so easy, the momentum shifting, birdied 7, 8, 9, played great, some really good shots.  In match play, so many things can happen, so you just want to keep going.  Then I played a few holes there, got the momentum back.  I'm happy.
Q. Do you feel in control by and large?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Well, you can never be in control of what he's doing.  Playing pretty solid and not trying to give away a lot of easy bogeys and stuff like that.  Got to keep the pressure on the other guy.
Q. Now looking forward to, well, it's going to be a busy day for you.  At least this was a relatively short match.
ROBERT KARLSSON: Well, it's never -- even though you only play 15 holes, it's a hundred percent play all the time.  It's nice to have a little bit of a lunch now and start again.  Every day you play 36 holes is better than going home after 18.
Q. Presumably you're feeling good about yourself into the quarterfinals?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, big surprise, I didn't really think I was going to play like this.  So things are coming better.
