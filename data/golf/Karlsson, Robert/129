  Q.  Very well played today.  You must be delighted with that.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, I am.  I'm really happy with coming off with a start like this.  It's always great, so that's good.   
  
  Q.  You hit a lot of quality iron shots out there.  The golf course is playing a bit longer this year, isn't it?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, it is, obviously after all the rain, and it's also a lot more rough out there this year, so it's important to stay in the fairway.  I struggled a little bit with that, but when I was in the fairway I did pretty well, so that was good.   
  
  Q.  You found the rough a couple of times, coming up 18.  Nearly a winner already in the 2008 season, bit of a sad end to Hong Kong, but obviously the form is great?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, I'm really happy with the way everything feels, and I'm just trying to build on what I'm doing.  So looking forward to the next few days.   
  
  Q.  How far have you worked your schedule out so far this season?  Are you going heavily for Ryder Cup points early?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  I can't really do it because, I mean, where I am right now in the World Rankings, I am sort of right on the borderline of getting into Doral and a few others that are World Tour events.  I'm just trying to take each tournament as it is, and if I get in those ones, it's great.   
 I'm in the Masters.  I'm really looking forward to that.  That's a great benefit.   
  
  Q.  I noticed you've got some new equipment in the bag?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  I have.  I tried the new Titleist clubs, the -- I don't remember the name, ZM forged, those ones, and I'm really happy with those.  Very similar to the other ones, but the flight is fantastic.   
  
  Q.  They look like they're new out this week?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  They are.  Actually last week, yeah.   
  
  Q.  So you hit a few shots with them first round, now you shoot 68.  Good way to start?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, they seem to work pretty good, don't they?   
  
  Q.  What is it, there's a few Scandinavians up on this leaderboard this week.  What is it with this part of the world?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Must have been the warm-up we had with this weather, I think.   
  
  Q.  Well, you've got off to a great start.  Keep it going.  Good luck.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Thanks.
