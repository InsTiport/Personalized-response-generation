Q.  There is a lot of talk about the Order of Merit race between Casey and Howell but you are right in there and keeping a low profile?
A.  Well, no one has asked me. The season has exceeded my expectations so much and I am just having fun and see what comes out of it. Let them fight for it if they want to. I am just doing my thing and see what happens.

Q.  You are not offended being missed out?
A.  Not at all. It is pretty bunched up and there are a couple of big ones coming up. I am just happy to be considered among them.

Q.  Are you thinking Order of Merit?
A.  Not at all. I was 38th last year and happy with that so if I stay where I am I will be happy. It is not about that. If I am happy on the golf course the rest takes care of itself. It has been an unbelievable season so far.

Q.  Has there been any talk between the three or you?
A.  No. Let them fight it out.

Q.  How do you feel this week?
A.  I came in at four o'clock yesterday and played three holes. I had a few days off, I was pretty tired after the match play and the Ryder Cup and spent some time with the family. I was pretty late coming in.

Q.  Tired after the Ryder Cup?
A.  A couple of days I felt a little low. There were big crowds and it was not the greatest playing such a  big event straight afterwards.

Q.  How big was the Ryder Cup in Sweden?
A.  It was big with us in it. I haven't read anything but people said it was in all the papers and I did some interviews. They do care. It was good.

Q.  You enjoyed it?
A.  It was good experience. 

Q.  Worth waiting six years for?
A.  Well I wasn't in the team in '99 but this was the better one to get into. I don't think that was a good experience for anyone. Especially what happened at the end and it was one of the things you hope never happens on a golf course again. But this was fantastic. Americans as well said this was the best one. This is the way golf is going to be played in that spirit. It was good to be involved, good for Ireland, good for the crowds and almost good for the Americans as they were very well received.
