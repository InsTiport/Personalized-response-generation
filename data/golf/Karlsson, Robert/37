 Q.   The key in an 18‑hole match is to get off to a fast start.   You did that with 3‑up after 6.   What was the key to that?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I think Frederick didn't play great today.   And the most important thing against a player like Freddie is not to give him any easy holes.   I was very, very good around the greens, so I kept it together and played really well today and that was the key.   
   
 Q.   When you get up early in a match like that, what's the mindset then carrying on?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   It's important to just keep playing.   It's easy to if you get ahead of yourself ‑‑ I did a little bit on the 10th.   It was a clumsy 3‑putt.   I pulled myself together and played well from there in.   
   
 Q.   The first four times you played in this championship, you lost in the first round.   Then you won twice through to the second round and got beat.   Is this year the year?   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   We'll see.   We'll see.   I mean, I've played some good golf around here a few times.   I lost to Phil Mickelson early on one.   Shot 64 and lost to Casey.   So it can happen in match play.   
I mean, it's tough matches coming up.   I don't know who I'm playing tomorrow, but I'm assuming it would be Westwood.   
   
 Q.   Looking like Westwood.   They are still in there as we speak.   
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Okay, yeah.   So I mean, it's no easy matches no matter who it is going to be.
