   ROBERT KARLSSON: I don't mean putts he holed but it was an exhibition of putting.   
 Well, I did my part and I didn't play that well today, so there we go. But I had a chance up until the 17th where I hit a poor shot, but it's been one of those weeks where I haven't hit the ball great, and when it's been in between it's just been a bit, and I've had a few indifferent shots.  
  
  Q. But you made a huge slice out of the Order of Merit.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Very close.   
  
  Q. What are your thoughts on what you'll do, will you change your schedule?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: No, I'm going to putt the club as way for a week and take it easy and just rest a bit.
