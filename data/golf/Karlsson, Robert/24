Q.   What are your thoughts on today? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   A bit of a mixed bag.   It was a messy day with the delay and everything.   The course obviously played very, very different today.   Played a lot longer and greens are softer, so it's a bit tricky hitting short irons into the greens and the rough was trickier.   Happy. 

Q.   Tell me about the eagle at 17?
ROBERT KARLSSON:   They moved the tee, so it's 255 to the front of the green, and I just looked at it, usually try to look at the shot in front of me if this would be a par 5, I would go for it.   I was like, yeah, I would. 
This time, I can choose my line, as well and it was perfect distance for my 3‑wood.   So hit a perfect 3‑wood, straight up the line and landed to the front of the green and rolled up to about six feet.

Q.   I take it in many ways, it's like playing a different course today, and the weather has made its difference?
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, definitely.   It plays a lot longer.   The rough is different but it's a very, very bunched up leaderboard.   It's going to be interesting tomorrow. 

Q.   Last time I looked, there were 30 players within four strokes, so presumably you have to shoot low. 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, you just have to keep going.   It's one of those courses, it's very, very inviting and the greens are fantastic.   As I said before, Jack Nicklaus golf course, very often inviting to play, so if you're playing good, the score is out there.
