 Q. Going along very nicely before called off?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Almost been waiting for it all afternoon. Looked like it's going to miss, maybe, maybe not; and maybe, maybe not. And well, just playing well. 

 Q. Plenty of birdies out there? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, looks like there's been low scoring in the groups ahead of us, as well. I think it's -- the wind is a little bit friendly I think for the par 5s. The short ones are now sort of more cross-wind which makes the longer ones downwind, so that usually gives --

 Q. Were you focused? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, so far so good. Keep it going. Still another 20 holes to go. One hole to finish and 19 holes to go. 

 Q. And the one where you hit the car park by some spectators?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, pulled it a bit, hit once, maybe twice. 

 Q. Interesting third shot. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: The pin was way up and the trees were high. I got a good lie when I dropped it. It looked worse than it was.
