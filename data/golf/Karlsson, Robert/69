  Q. You have won a match. How does that feel?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It is good. It is nice not to have to go home on a Wednesday.  
  
  Q. What was the key to the victory?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I played well. I had a really, really good start. I think I was 6-under par on the front 9, or something like that. Obviously that was a great start.   
 I struggled in the end, but kept playing well.  
  
  Q. 6-under through 14. Were you thinking, Rory, go away?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: When you are playing somebody like Rory, he is a very, very strong competitor. He is very, very good in his short game. You know he is going to put a good score together. I mean, sometimes he will lose one, but it doesn't matter in the match play.   
  
  Q. How did your winning at the beginning of the year change things for you in the season?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I was very tired in Dubai. I have changed my schedule a little. I'm very, very happy.   
 Obviously it feels better when you are playing good coming into these tournaments.  
  
  Q. Great playing. Go win again tomorrow.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Thank you.
