Q. With the exception on 6, you had a good round today?ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, it was a tough round, especially the front.  Our first eight holes it was really, really windy, and if you're a little bit off, it was easy to get in trouble.  Almost missed my tee shot and had a horrific lie.  When I stood by the ball, I couldn't actually see where it was.  I put down my wedge and was like "oof".  I was pretty happy to get it out.  On the end of the day, that happens on links golf.  You're going to have your bad breaks and your good ones.  It happens.Q. Everybody talks about you have to make hay on the par 5s.  Are you happy with what you did today?ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, pretty happy.  It's not the easiest golf course even if -- you've got to play well to make birdies.  That's just the way it is.  And 71 was a pretty good round.  I was a couple under on the par 5s, that's not too bad.Q. Compare the conditions yesterday and today?ROBERT KARLSSON: Different.  In the morning yesterday was no wind whatsoever.  And today, I mean, at first it was very, very difficult, and then it calmed down a little bit.  But it was definitely three or four shots harder today.Q. Put yourself very much in for the weekend, happy about that?ROBERT KARLSSON: It's a long week.  And I'm playing pretty well.  I'm playing fine, I'm producing, so I'm happy where I am.
