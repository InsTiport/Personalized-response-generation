Q.
How do you think you played today compared to the other three rounds?
ROBERT KARLSSON:  I think it's been steady progress.  It has not shown in the scores, but that's a bit more of the days when you hold the putts or not.  Today I birdied all the par 5s which was nice.  I think I only made one birdie on the par 5s earlier in the week, so I played those better but then I missed a couple of short putts and taking my chances.
Q.  How do you think the course played today compared to the other days, is it any different, more difficult today or not?
ROBERT KARLSSON:  The course has been fantastic all week I think.  I'm European, I think it's fantastic, really fair.
Q.  So it's fair for a major?
ROBERT KARLSSON:  I think it is.  It's there but you've got to play it    if you're going to shoot well, you're going to play it.  It's been dry, so the rough has been playable.  I haven't had any lies where I have had to just chop it out, and I think that's good.  I don't think it should be just chop out sideways; that isn't much of a skill.  Here, you can get it up and around the greens but that's not always the best idea, anyway.  I think it's been very, very good.  I really enjoyed the week.
