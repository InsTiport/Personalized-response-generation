 Q. Give us your thoughts on the day?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Pretty good. It's great to be back playing the last few groups. It's obviously a bit different and really, really enjoy it, and to be in that situation, it's good. 

 Q. You were in good form today? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It's coming. It's coming. A lot of good stuff. A few weak ones, failed to get the pace of the greens today. The greens are speeding up, but they are still a little grainy, but all in all, good.

 Q. Everybody speaks about this time of the year, getting the rust off, but very few players had the time away that you did. Do you find that's a little harder to get more rust off? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Well, I had a short winter, probably shorter than most. I'm trying to keep following what I did last year. And it's always great to be here, because these events, the courses are always set up very, very well and it's a good test, it's a good way to get into the season.

 Q. And you're still very much in the tournament. You're still not -- your thoughts on tomorrow, figure in mind?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: No, go out and try to do the best I can. We'll see. There's a lot of good players up there, which is great.
 It's great for the tournament to have this kind of leaderboard so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

 Q. Are you going to be leaderboard watching or just concentrating, head down? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Head down. I did today and it felt pretty good.
