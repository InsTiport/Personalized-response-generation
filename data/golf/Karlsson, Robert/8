 Q.  Final round, how was that?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: It was good.  Not good enough but it was good.  I played so much better than yesterday.  Yesterday was a tough, tough day, and I was very, very excited to get off with a 67.   
Today I played really, really nicely, and I put a bit of pressure on him.  But he just kept going.  I was just happy to putt a really good final round together when I was finally in the last group for the first time in a hundred years, it feels like.   
 Q.  How do you assess the week as a whole?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: It's been great, great.  I feel that things have been coming a bit closer.  I've been putting in a bunch of good rounds.  At least this week, I put in two good rounds.  In the evening I talked to my coach back in Sweden and I'm like, yeah, at least we've done two rounds in a row; at least we've done three rounds in a row.  Things are coming, and especially the way things felt on the first tee yesterday and the first tee today.  It was like, well, this is what I'm playing for and this is where I want to be.  I enjoyed it a lot out there today.   
 Q.  How impressed were you with the way Paul played today?  
ROBERT KARLSSON: He did everything right.  From start to finish, and the chip on 18, it was kind of one of those days.  He was super, super solid all the way.  He did the important saves.  On 12, he couldn't drop it because then he had to drop it in the rough because it was so wet, and he made a great up-and-down there.  I mean, he hit it on 11 and missed the green left and hit a sprinkler and comes back to six-foot and roles that in.  When that happened, I'm like, maybe it is his day today.  It's impressive and it's fun to see someone playing that well under pressure.
