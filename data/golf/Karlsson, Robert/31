Q.   Tough conditions today, obviously.   However, overall it was a good week for you.   Just some comments on the week. 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I'm very, very happy with the way I played this week.   It was difficult to get the ball to the hole the last couple of days, but at the same time you don't want to start to force it.   It's very easy to get four feet by, and you don't want to leave yourself four‑footers on the greens the way they are now.   So I'm very happy with it.

Q.   What were you most pleased with as far as your game? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   It was the sort of week I hit a lot of greens and I gave myself a lot of chances, so it was good.

Q.   Obviously, you living in this area and the way that you played, you must be certainly happy with how you played in front of probably a lot of family and friends? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, it was nice.   It was nice to have a lot of local support, and I really, really appreciate them coming out and helping me out.

Q.   Obviously, to finish a shot back to possibly be in a playoff, how disappointing is that?   Did you sort of feel like maybe‑‑
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I'm a couple of shots back.

Q.   So to be a couple shots back. 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Sometimes that happens, and sometimes you're on the other side.   That's the way it is.   I mean, obviously, I can find a few shots out there, but I'm sure that Phil and David Lynn can as well.   So I have what's on the scorecard now and I'm very satisfied with those results.

Q.   So more positives than negatives for the week then? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, I think so.

Q.   How do you take this as far as building on momentum? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I think I'm going to have the week off next week.   I don't think I'll be at TPC, so I'll have a week off to keep working a bit on my game.   At least I've proven to myself I can play golf, so that is very, very positive.
