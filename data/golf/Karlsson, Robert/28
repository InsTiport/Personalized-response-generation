  ROBERT KARLSSON:     Obviously it's very wet.   It's unbelievable that we're playing at all.   The amount of rain that's been here the last few days, the course is in really great condition.

Q.   You took advantage of parâ€‘5s, birdies on all of them.
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, I played pretty good.   Hit my short irons well and knocked in the necessary putts.

Q.   Talk about your back nine , the front nine on the golf course.   You got on quite a roll there, three birdies in a row. 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, hit some good iron shots and knocked in some putts.   I mean, I gave myself a whole bunch of chances and I took them, so it was great.

Q.   We're not going to belabor your last couple years.   You've had injury problems; you've had some putting problems.   Are you past all that?
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, I feel pretty happy the way I'm going.   Finished 10th last week.   I didn't score very well in the playoff, the Web.com playoffs, but I had the feeling the game was coming back and gave myself last week in Jacksonville. 
Didn't take it, but I mean, it's coming.

Q.   I am looking at your stroke on the shorter putts, 3 feet and in it's very firm and very confident looking to me. 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, the greens are very true.   Yeah, feels pretty good.
