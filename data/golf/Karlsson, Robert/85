   ROBERT KARLSSON: I was pleased with that for my first round of the year, I played well all round. I putted well which was the key and my statistics were helped at the 17th where I hit the ball to about 18 feet and was just off the green and sunk the putt for a birdie - which of course does not count for the stats.
 I don't feel any extra pressure after finishing number one last year, all I am trying to do is the same things. But it will be harder to be number one again this year because of the players who are coming over for the Race To Dubai.
 But I have no complaints about that because its great for our sponsors and for us it means that tournaments like this will carry more world ranking points. I will be playing ten events in America this year but I am not taking out US Tour membership because I don't need to with the ranking points that are going to be available here.
