Q.   Thoughts on that? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   It was a pretty scruffy match from both of us.   Played way better yesterday. 

Q.   Both matches went well and changed at the last minute? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yesterday I played well actually.   I didn't lose any shots.   I shot 69‑‑ should have been a few better but today I was hoping to get away with a halve. 

Q.   Beautiful shot at the last. 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, I needed to give myself a birdie.   It was hard to see from where I was but looked like it was in the hole. 

Q.   I t was very close.   Some disappointment there because you were a sponsor's invite?
ROBERT KARLSSON:   I just didn't play well.   That's the end of it. 

Q.   So wait around and see what happens with G‑Mac and Kruger in the afternoon? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Well, obviously‑‑ the afternoon, it's not over yet. 

Q.   Tricky; just time to kill? 
ROBERT KARLSSON:   Yeah, go back to sleep.
