 Q. Well, that seemed like a very big fish that was getting away from you and you reeled it all back in again. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, I was very, very proud of the way I managed to turn it around. I hit a few good shots on the way in and managed to get the putter going. It's that kind of golf course. I didn't play particularly bad on the front and I didn't really get it going. I was just a little bit off and when I was off, it would just got wrong way and when I got a better chance, I missed it. So there we go.

 Q. Is the back nine considerably easier or just the way it worked today?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Just the way it worked today. It was a bit of a funny wind today. Not as much cross on 9 and 18 and 10, which usually is just more down and up, which makes 10 shorter. 
 But at the same time, that front left pin, it's a nasty pin, no matter where the wind is. 

 Q. Funny wind is a good description, because we anticipated lower scores given the calm conditions but it's just tricky. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It is. I've never played the golf course with these firm fairways and that's both good and bad. It's good, obviously the course plays a bit shorter. But it's more difficult to hold the fairways, and a lot of these fairways are slightly on a bit of an angle. So they get quite narrow, the fairways, and you sort of have to find the right angle off the tee and the right distance, even on the tee shots. 
 So it's not easy when the fairways are firm and the rough is thick. Because obviously you are not playing a lot on the fringe, even your good shots.

 Q. I have to ask about your playing partner, Thomas BjÃ¶rn. He looks in great shape. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, he played good. It's good to see Thomas back. He's gone through his difficulties but he's playing great now and I was very impressed the way he played today.
