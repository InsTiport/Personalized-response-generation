  Q.  Talk about your round and the way you scored.  Who knows where you'll end up finishing, but are you pleased overall?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, I'm really pleased overall.  The weekend has been great.  I made eight birdies yesterday, so I knew it was there.  I dumped three balls in the water yesterday, but without that, the weekend would have been really, really great.   
 Today, though, I managed to keep it together, and when I missed shots I made up-and-downs, which was really good to keep the round going.  Wherever I finish, I'll be pretty happy with where it is.  The most important thing is that I had fun out there today and put a really, really good round together.   
  
  Q.  Obviously Thursday was kind of one of those crazy days with the wind and the weather that it was, but you guys seemed to figure it out as time went on.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, every time -- for me it's the first time here.  It's been the first time pretty much at every tournament here in America this year.  The longer the week, the further into the week you get, it's easier to find out how to get around the golf courses.  But I definitely enjoyed it.  You grow as a player and as a person, and that's the most important thing.
