   ROBERT KARLSSON: Played well and it's been a good day. Only had two bogeys in 36 holes which is not bad round here. But they came on the 12th which is about 100 yards and the sixth which you can drive but that's golf sometimes.   
  
  Q. All to play for this weekend?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It is but it is very important not to get all caught up in that. Whenever you play in America it is very bunched up and can go either way. You can go back or forwards so it's important not to get caught up as one bad shot can cost three. It's that kind of course.  
  
  Q. Game in good shape?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Pretty good. I am pleased with the way I have played since the Open and haven't really pulled it together.   
  
  Q. Highlights?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Drive, 5-wood on the last to ten feet. Unfortunately I didn't hole the putt. And on the 15th hit a seven iron third shot and made par. They are the important shots in these conditions. It is getting tough out there. Hit a wood into the 17th, six iron into the 16th and couldn't reach the 15th so it is really tough.
