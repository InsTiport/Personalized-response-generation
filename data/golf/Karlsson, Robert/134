   ROBERT KARLSSON:  Pretty happy with that. It is a long time since I played this well so I am very pleased. 

 Q.  You have lost a bit of form recently, what has been going on? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  I got a bit caught up in technique and didn't putt well and one thing led to another and it is difficult to make birdies. 

 Q.  How do you get out of that? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  I had a putting lesson from my manager and all of a sudden things went right. Steadied things up and you hole a few putts. It is easy to get caught in bad habits but just trying to work through it. 

 Q.  Does it help coming back to a course where you are defending champion? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Oh yes. It brings back good memories. The course is quite open and I am playing well.
