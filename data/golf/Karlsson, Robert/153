Q. Anything under 70 is a pretty good score in these conditions?
ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, I mean, the course, I didn't play last year, but it's in very, very good condition.  It's pretty much the same as it is every year.  It's a bit harder this year.
Q.  You played pretty well all day today, did you?
ROBERT KARLSSON:  I had a couple bad shots, a tee shot on 1, the tee shot on 18 was left, the spot I was in.  Left on 18 you can get away with.  It was good.
Q.  How would you assess the season coming into this last event?
ROBERT KARLSSON:  I played very good.  I'm happy with my long game, and that's unusual for me.  So I'm very happy with the long game.  It's definitely been a very good season compared to what I did last year, so I'm very happy, and then you can always think back, if I would have done that or done that.
Q.  One thing missing, though; a victory.
ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah.  So, that's the thing that comes if you play very well over a period of time.  The closer I get to have a good chance of winning, I haven't putted good enough.

San Roque would have been a good chance if I would have just played decently and also in    I played good earlier on.
Q.  So this corner of Spain is quite lucky for you, you've play well here?
ROBERT KARLSSON:  Apparently so, yeah.  Won a couple of times in Valencia, that's not too far.
