Q. What are your thoughts on coming through in extra time at the 20th hole?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Great.  I played quite nicely in the beginning, and made a lot of putts, a lot of very important putts, very, very proud of that.  And kept going.
Q. You looked like you were very much in control of that match, what was a run of four birdies in five holes and 3-up.
ROBERT KARLSSON: I didn't do much wrong.  I hit a couple of iffy putts and then he started to play a bit better.  That is match play; he did what I did to Ramsay on 16, he did that to me today.  Those are the things that happen and you just have to keep going.  Very proud that I went through.
Q. Do you get edgy when it comes down to the wire?
ROBERT KARLSSON: It's a tournament.  It's right to the end.  It should be edgy a little bit.  That's why we play golf.  That's why we're here.
Q. How is your energy level now?  You have Kiradech Aphibarnrat soon?
ROBERT KARLSSON: I'm fine.  It's the last game of the week, so it's good.
