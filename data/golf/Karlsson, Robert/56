 Q. How good were those par saves, for instance, on 6? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, the one on 6 was a bit special. I mean, to keep the round going, it's easy to get into -- if you're holing out well. 

 Q. You're the defending champion of course. Does this golf course suit your eye, did you say? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I only have one (laughing).
 Yeah, I've played well here a few times and the year before I won. I like this golf course. It's always in great condition. 

 Q. I've got to ask, how confusing was the wind today?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Well, you knew where it came from, that's for sure. But it was going a bit up-and-down and it was actually a bit gusty. It's the first time in a long time I've played in this amount of wind.

 Q. Was it a case of adapting your game and using your imagination?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Definitely. In the morning I had 93 yards to the flag and I hit 9-iron. It was definitely very windy.

 Q. On the whole, feeling positive about your game?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, very happy. I played well last week and keep going this week, so it's good. 

 Q. If you wouldn't mind summing up your round, how do you feel about it?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: I'm very happy with the round today. It wasn't easy out there. It was very, very windy. The golf course has a lot of heavy rough on it this year. So shooting under par the first round, very happy.

 Q. What are your plans for the rest of the week, more of the same?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, around here you never know what's happening with the weather forecast or what the wind is going to do. 
 So you just have to keep very patient and you're going to get your odd bogeys and you're going to get your missed putts. So it's not easy, just keep going, keep your head on and keep going and try to enjoy it as much as possible.
