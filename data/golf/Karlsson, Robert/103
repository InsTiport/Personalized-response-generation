   ROBERT KARLSSON: It was good play. I played really well all the way round. It was important I got a half on the first. I had a good round and made three birdies but didn't give anything away which was the most important thing especially against Justin. I had to keep the screws on all the time, I can't start giving holes away to him. It was also nice not having to come down those last few holes. It was important to get a bit of blue on the board as well which felt good.   
 Obviously I am extremely happy with it but we will see how much it matters at the end. But I have played seven matches and not one a full point until now even though I had played really well. That's the way it goes and hopefully it will give the boys a chance at the end.
