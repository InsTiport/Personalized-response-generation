Q. Was it really bad out there?
ROBERT KARLSSON: On and off.  There was one bad shower that came, like, oh, this is not good; if this goes for ten minutes, we cannot play.  But it was only ten, 15 minutes.
Q. 65 today, tell us about your round?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, very happy with that.  It was not so easy.  The rain came and went a bit.  There was a couple really, really heavy showers and happy with that round.  Good.
Q. What were the key factors in the game?
ROBERT KARLSSON: When it's hard conditions as it was for a while, you just need to keep plodding along, give yourself chances and not drop a shot.  I did well on that.
Q. You had a nice run of birdies on the top of the hill, 6, 7, 8.  Was that putting or long game or what was that?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Putting, unbelievable.  I've not done three really long ones in a row, so it's fun.  Obviously I had some chances, as well.  It was a good round all in all, but obviously nice to knock in a few long ones.
Q. What's the key to adapting to playing in the rain?
ROBERT KARLSSON: When it's really hard, you need to keep the ball in play.  It was really close out there today that you couldn't keep going, because it started to puddle up just around the greens.  The greens are fine but just outside the greens and on some of the fairways.  You want to be in the short stuff.
Q. You must be very happy with your position going into the weekend?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Definitely.  It's great to be up on the leaderboard and see your name up there.  That's why we say, so it's good fun.
