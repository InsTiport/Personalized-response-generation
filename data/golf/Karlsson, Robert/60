  Third Round 67. 9-Under. 207 Total.  
   
  Q. 65, 75, 67; explain yourself?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Wasn't surprised you started with that question. If I could, I would have changed but I don't know, I felt like I played pretty well yesterday. Just couldn't hole the putts, and there we go. I played pretty similar today and yesterday. I played better on Thursday but today and yesterday was pretty similar. Today, 67; yesterday, 75.  
  
  Q. We know you had your eye problem last year and it really disrupted your year and obviously a fuller one. How do you feel about this season?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Pretty good. It's been a bit inconsistent. I won once and I've been second a couple of times. I was fourth in Japan last week.   
 It's not like I've played bad but I haven't really put it together. It's not that easy to come back after a long injury, because even if you don't feel bad, if it's more that the confidence isn't there.  
 -- I mean, 2008, I played fantastic and just kept racking up Top-10 finishes and playing very, very solid. I haven't done that this year, and it's more sort of getting used to being there again and playing week-in and week-out.  
  
  Q. Fancy your chances tomorrow?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: There's a lot of players up there. It's bunching up a little bit I noticed. It's going to be difficult, but all to play for.
