Q. Great 66. `One of your lowest rounds this year.  You must be happy with that in these conditions?
ROBERT KARLSSON: The course is quite friendly because it wasn't that windy, and also, it plays wet and soft, so usually links courses can get really, really tricky when it's firm, and now, it's miserable to be out playing but the conditions are quite nice for us scoring-wise.  It's nice.  I enjoyed playing and I'm enjoying this golf course and it's good to be here.
Q. Winner at the Dunhill Links previously.  You must be enjoy playing on links golf courses?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, links golf is what it is.  You have to learn to deal with bad bounces and all the stuff that comes with it, so yeah, but I enjoy it, and it's a nice mix.  It's a little bit unfortunate that we play this early in the season because it would be nice to play three, four, five weeks later.  I know the weather can be that, anyway, but a bigger chance.
Q. Seeing the score Matthew Jordan posted, was it nice going out there knowing there was a low score to be had?
ROBERT KARLSSON: In general I thought it was fairly low scoring, what we saw in the clubhouse, anyway.  I played yesterday in the Pro-Am and it was quite windy but if there's not much wind, you have a lot of wedges.  Links courses are hard if you take away the wind.  Today was quite nice to us, even though it was cold.
Q. Happy to be in the mix?
ROBERT KARLSSON: Of course.  Of course.  That's why we're here.
