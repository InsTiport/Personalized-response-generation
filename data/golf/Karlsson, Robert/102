  Q. How have you gone on last few holes?   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It's not the coldest, I think other guys when we played the Dunhill here, the team lost, in 1992, but pretty close. Top ten.   
  
  Q. It was certainly bitter out there, wasn't it, very punishing conditions.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yes, but we had good fun out there, so it's fine.   
  
  Q. Put your round into context given those conditions.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Pretty good. I played well all in all, happy with that.   
  
  Q. And your position on the leaderboard can't be better going into the weekend.   
 ROBERT KARLSSON: No, but I mean, when you play these courses, anything can happen, you can get bad weather, so much can happen around here. Still two rounds to go, and don't know what's going to happen, tomorrow, with bad weather playing Carnoustie.   
  
  Q. Do you like this format?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, it's good fun. I've had the pleasure to play for half a dozen years and it's been great. If these would be nice conditions, it would be great.   
  
  Q. Even in good company, those rounds are long?  
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It's getting a bit too long when it's cold, especially on this course as well especially around the turn, and you have the paragraph 311th which crosses the 7th, around there, it feels like forever when you're playing three or four holes.   
 That's always tough, feels like you're not moving and you're back from the same place and it's hard to get into a rhythm, especially when it's such a long time between shots.   
 But that's a part of the sport.
