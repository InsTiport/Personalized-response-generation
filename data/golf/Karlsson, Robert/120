   ROBERT KARLSSON: I didn't play very well. It was incredible, I just gave myself a chance to get into the playoff. A couple really bad shots at first. Never really got it going. 
 It was a tough day. 

 Q. Overall, how do you feel about the weekend? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: It's the best I've ever done around here. 

 Q. Was it playing tough out there today?
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Not really, I just wasn't making anything. Didn't really get it going and I didn't hole the putts. 

 Q. What was going through your mind on the last? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Just wondering if there was going to be a playoff when Miguel missed his chip. Apart from that, just disappointed I missed the first one and then should have taken more time on the second one. I was sort of right over it. 

 Q. Your best finish here. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Best finish here and keep on playing. 

 Q. Quick word about the hole-in-one? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON: Yeah, from the tee, you can't really see it but just looking -- very quickly -- and I've never seen it, but I bounced it -- must have done something. It wasn't what I was expecting.
