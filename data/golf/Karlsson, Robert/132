   ROBERT KARLSSON: We knew we had to keep making birdies against Monty and Marc. It's the first time we played together and it felt like a good pairing and it's good because we are in the World cup together. Same with Monty and Marc, so I had a laugh at that. We were 11 under par and shows we had good timing. When I was out of the game my solid partner took care of things. We were nine under after 11 and if you are not leading a match with that score, you are unlucky! But we were just two up and we knew we had to keep going. That's fourballs. Important to get off to a good start.
