 Q.  Yesterday 68, today 70, 6-under.  You have to be pleased with that score after 36 holes. 
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, I'm really pleased with the way things are going.  I'm playing really well, so I'm definitely pleased with it. 

 Q.  We talked yesterday, the scores are so low and the wind continues to howl.  Does that surprise you how low everyone is going? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  I haven't really looked on the boards.  I've had enough worries about my own ball, so I haven't really looked at anything.  It's a completely opposite wind today.  Some holes are harder, some holes are easier, but I think this is the wind most players are used to playing this course.  I think this is pretty much what the Blue Monster is all about.  You've got to play well on the holes that give you chances and make sure you don't make any stupid mistakes. 

 Q.  You have to score on the par-5s here.  Tiger is 8-under on the par-5s over the last two days -- 
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Not too bad. 

 Q.  Yeah, not bad.  You know if you don't birdie a hole or at least eagle it, you're going to lose ground? 
 ROBERT KARLSSON:  Yeah, you have a few chances here on the par-5s.  It's low scoring, so you almost have to make it on the par-5s.
