 Q.  How did you play today?
PAT BATES: Oh, shaky.  I bogeyed the first hole.  I made a bunch of birdies on the front and birdied nine to shoot 3-under and then I'm right in good position.  And then I had about a five or six-footer for par on 13 and it lipped out violently.  And then I birdied 16 and then I hit a bad second shot on 17 and hit a really nice putt.  Again another lipout.  So those were tough to take, but I can't say I'm happy with the round.  I guess I'm more happy for Glen.  He played great.  And took it in and did the things he had to do to be leader.

Q.  Talk about Sunday, five shots out here is not a lot to make up.  And you have a little bit of an advantage, you're going to be a couple twosomes up.  So you can kind of post a number, put a little pressure on the others, don't you think?
PAT BATES:  Yeah, I think so.  I think if you post a score here, I mean 17 and 18 are pretty tough holes when you're coming in.  So whoever wins here is going to earn it.  But I think we're going to have to get to about 20 now, it looks like.  So I'm going to enjoy the day and head out tomorrow and do my best.
