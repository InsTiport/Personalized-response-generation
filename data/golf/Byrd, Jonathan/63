  Q.  Decisive win.  I think the first hole you were able to make a good look at birdie, made the par and Andres bogeyed.  Always good to get up early in match play?   
 JONATHAN BYRD:  Absolutely.  I've been fortunate the last two days to have that.  He missed about a four-footer, five-footer on the first hole.  And then just like yesterday, I was able to not have to hit great shots but able to hit quality shots and kind of keep the pressure on him.   
 And the third hole he three-putted from the middle of the green after I lagged it up close.  And then -- one of the turnarounds, I think I was 3-up going into 5.  I made a great birdie on 4.  I hit a terrible tee shot and was able to halve him on 5 and then halved 7 and we both birdied 8.   
 He hit it about eight -- I'm 3-up on 8.  He hits a great shot in there about 10 feet and I hit it about 40 feet and I made the putt.  Then he made it on top of me.  I stayed 3-up.   
 He gave me one more hole with a bogey.  I think he made three or four bogeys, and I still haven't made a bogey yet this week.  That's good in match play.   
  
  Q.  You're in the last 16 standing; now it's got to feel good.   
 JONATHAN BYRD:  Absolutely.  Like I said, I'm coming in with no expectations.  You could run into somebody and run into a buzz saw and get beat playing well, so I feel fortunate to have won the first two.  I'm really enjoying playing match play, which I don't get to do too often.   
  
  Q.  Talk about being at Match Play and maybe some goals for the upcoming season.   
 JONATHAN BYRD:  This is a good experience, I feel, for match play for Ryder Cup.  That's obviously a big goal to make Ryder Cup.  Every day I get here is good experience for Ryder Cup.
