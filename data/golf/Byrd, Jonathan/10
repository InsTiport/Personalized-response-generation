Q.   Nice day out there.   Can we get some comments on your round?
JONATHAN BYRD:   It was a fun day.   Got a little momentum.   Played with a rookie, Kevin Lucas.   I think his first TOUR event.   So I remember what that was like.
He did a good job out there, handled himself well and had some good holes.   But I just played sharp today.   It was one of my best rounds this summer, for sure. 
And it's a nice, clean round.   Made one bogey, one bad tee shot on 17, and putted well.   Made some nice par putts and probably my best putting round in a while.

Q.   Thoughts going into tomorrow?   Anything can happen in this format.   You make up a lot of points. 
JONATHAN BYRD:   Yeah, yeah.   I mean, the guys coming in, you know, the wind‑‑ the wind was really tough and swirling.   But once you get‑‑ you can get some points coming in in the last hole, there are going to be some eagles, and so I just hope the leaders don't run too far. 
But if you get it going on the scores like I did last year in the final round, you can catch a lot of ground‑‑ make up a lot of ground.

Q.   You lost your record today.   Mallinger got 19 points.   But you had the record‑‑
JONATHAN BYRD:   What was mine? 

Q.   18. 
JONATHAN BYRD:   Good for him.

Q.   Speaking of anybody can win this, you were on the cut line last year, came back and finished second.   Do you remember that and thinking on Friday afternoon:   I've still got a shot?
JONATHAN BYRD:   No, I wasn't thinking that.   I was just trying to make the cut.   But the way this score is, the wind comes up in the afternoon, which we haven't had these first two days, but this morning I'm sure this golf course was just, you know, there for the taking.   The wind came up this afternoon started swirling, makes it a lot more difficult.
