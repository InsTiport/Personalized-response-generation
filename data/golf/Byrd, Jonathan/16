Q.   We talked yesterday.   You came off a really good round yesterday.   Did that help you right momentum, right mindset coming into today?
JONATHAN BYRD:   Absolutely.   Yesterday I had an eagle and made like three or four birdies and just felt good on the golf course.   I felt like I was getting into a good play rhythm yesterday.   And I haven't felt that a whole lot this year.
So that was one of the first days I've felt that way on the golf course.   I felt like I was going to make putts and felt like I was going to hit good shots.   And that's the way I felt today.
And today I just said my whole mindset was just to be a little more aggressive and give ourselves chances and just free it up.   And I was able to do that today and just getting off to a hot start. 
The first hole I chipped in from just off the back of the green.   Followed that up with another birdie on the par 5 and out of a plugged lie on 3, the bunker, I made a great par. 
And then made a 40‑footer‑‑ 50‑footer on the next hole for birdie.   By that point I made three birdies and then birdied the next hole.   Just felt like I was off to the races. 
Just felt like I had to keep the pedal down.   But, I mean, I shot 8‑under, if you're keeping score.   But I 3‑putted 8.   And with that 7‑ or 8‑iron in my hand, the last hole I made par.   I had two par 5s that was a little under my skin there. 
I did eagle‑‑ bogeyed 1 and eagled 4, I think it's 4.   And knocked it right up there next to green on 5 and made another birdie.   I'm happy.

Q.   Best two‑round stretch you've had in your career?
JONATHAN BYRD:   No.   In my career?   No.

Q.   Or here?
JONATHAN BYRD:   Here for sure, yeah.   I don't know if I've had a top 10 here.   So this is the best I've played here.
