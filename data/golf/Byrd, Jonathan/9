 Q.   Your second top three finish in as many starts here.   What is it about this place?   Is it format.   Is it the golf course?   A combination?  
JONATHAN BYRD:   I think it's 50% format and 50% golf course.   Maybe more format.   I just have a‑‑ the format makes you play more aggressive.   That's good for me.   
   
 Q.   You proved that last year.   
JONATHAN BYRD:   It helps me mentally, too.   When you make a bogey I'm not as hard on myself.   I'm like, Well, okay, it's just one point, you know.  
So there is a lot to be learned from that from a mindset standpoint.   I like the golf course.   Gives you a little room off the tee.   It frees you up a little bit.   
There is just a lot of opportunities out there.   I'm a good putter, so the more opportunities I have I feel like I can capitalize.  
   
 Q.   Is there anything that you're taking away from this week about your game that you're particularly happy with?  
JONATHAN BYRD:   Well, I putted great on the weekend.   My first nine today I didn't make much.   The whole weekend I freed it up with my putting and putted really well.   
Then my golf swing felt a little simpler, you know, and I wasn't hard on myself.   I'm obviously in a position, 151 or 152, so I had to play well.   
It's nice to play well when you need to.
