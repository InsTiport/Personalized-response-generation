Q.   Talk about the round and conditions and what it was like out there today?
JONATHAN BYRD:   Well, started off the round feel like the course was going to be getting progressively harder throughout the day.   The wind was quite gusty starting out.   But I felt like the greens stayed about the same all day.   They stayed very receptive to shots.   I've seen this course in the past, a couple years ago, where the greens almost got purple and they got really hard, and I was expecting that.   They remained very playable.

Q.   Kuchar is getting to 11 or 12, but there are a whole lot of players bunched up between 6 and that point, which is where you are.   Do you feel like five or six shots with not a lot of guys is something that with a good round can be made up on this course?
JONATHAN BYRD:   I think if you're within six shots, you have a chance to win the golf tournament, there's no question.   I mean, who was it last year, a couple years ago, Alex Cejka, and he fell back.   This is a difficult golf course.   You don't have to get far off to struggle. 
So whoever wins is got to play a heck of a rounds, and I think you can come from six, seven back possibly.

Q.   It's not overly difficult to shoot 4‑under, 5‑under tomorrow, if you're striking the ball well. 
JONATHAN BYRD:   I thought the golf course would be progressively more difficult, and I think it will be tomorrow.   Maybe a couple years ago, two or three years ago, they got too out of hand and they don't want to do that again. 
But I do think the course will get harder as the day goes on, because they are going to let it get firmer.   So that means that that last player has got to play in it the most.   So if you go out and play well, you can catch him.
