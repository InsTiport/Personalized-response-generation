  Q. Jonathan, I know it was frustrating day, 73. But the birdie at 18 had to make you feel a little bit better?  
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, the back nine helped.   
 You know, I just didn't get off to a great start. You know, I really didn't hit that many poor shots, I just had a bad putting day. And I just couldn't get the speed down for the most part. And you know I had two, three putts from the front nine and, you know, I hit a poor shot on Number 2. Put myself in a really difficult position to make par, and I just couldn't get any momentum, you know. Made a couple more bogeys on the front and just kind of got behind the 8 ball and just couldn't get it going back in the right direction.   
 But you just have days like that but it was unfortunate.  
  
  Q. Well now you can put it behind you and look ahead. You're in that bunch. You're just two shots out of the lead. There's a -- half a dozen players are right there.   
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah. I mean it's hard sleeping on the lead. It's difficult, and Charles will have to do that tonight.   
 Like I said, I really had to birdie the last hole. And I gave myself a good look at eagle and left myself with about a 7-footer, which wasn't great but, you know, I made that. And hopefully that will turn into making more putts tomorrow and see what happens.  
  
  Q. I remember last year at John Deere you came from behind. Maybe that's what you are more comfortable with?  
 JONATHAN BYRD: I wish I could say that, but I'm usually more comfortable in the lead because you got shots to work with. But I won't have that luxury tomorrow. I have to really get it going tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Good luck tomorrow.   
 JONATHAN BYRD: Thanks, Doug.
