  Q. How was your day?  
 JONATHAN BYRD: It was a good day. Played well, like I've played well the first few days. Didn't make too many mistakes. I had one -- obviously, one real bad hole on 4. But I responded well and played the rest of the course wonderfully from there. I was very pleased with how I played today.  
  
  Q. After the shot on 18, do you feel like you carried momentum going into tomorrow?  
 JONATHAN BYRD: Absolutely. Any time you can birdie the last hole, you feel like you've got momentum going into the next day. Just always the best way to finish.  
  
  Q. Can you step a back and look at this leaderboard and appreciate what golf fans can expect for tomorrow. Names that are up there and the tightness of the group at the top.  
 JONATHAN BYRD: I guess. Any time there's a lot of guys with a chance to win, anybody who has probably 4 under or better, 3 to 4 under has a chance to win the golf tournament. As you've seen Geoff Ogilvy shoot 9 under today, it's out there.  
 If I'd had made a few birdies early and not made a triple today as well. It's a great event. Got a great field. No telling what's going to happen tomorrow.  
  
  Q. How do you approach things when it's so tight? You just go out there feeling like you need to play a little more cautious?  
 JONATHAN BYRD: No. You can't do that. You obviously have a game plan, and you just stick to your game plan. You've got to be a little bit more aggressive probably. Cautious usually gets you in trouble.  
  
  Q. You've been at this a long time. Does it get easier to throw off something like 4, I mean, to bounce back from that as you get older?  
 JONATHAN BYRD: I was talking to Tom over there, and he said, it's probably just maturity. I guess it's maturity. You make bad mistakes, dumb mistakes enough that you realize it.
