 Q. Good round, seven birdies, two bogeys and almost another one there at the 18th. 
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah. I played solid today. Didn't have a real good day with the putter today, but I've been striking the ball all week, giving myself a lot of opportunities, which I'm happy with. 
 Unfortunately I missed two short putts today, which I'll have to find a way to get out of my mind going into tomorrow. 

 Q. Hey, with the players now, who lead 13-under. If you finish at 11. They might make a couple more birdies. What is out there on this golf course, now playing in this condition, drying out a little bit? What's conceivably out there?
 JONATHAN BYRD: It definitely depends on what they do about lift, clean and place tomorrow, what they do about whether we're going to roll it in the rough, because that's still -- I missed four or five fairways today and had a perfect lie, that if I hadn't had that lie, I wouldn't have been able to go at the flag; I wouldn't have been able to hit it 20 feet, and wouldn't have had birdie opportunities. 
 So I think it depends on that, and it depends on the wind. You know, that wind came up this afternoon, so it's always the conditions, but with the greens the way they are, I think there's always a real low number out there. 
 You know, I made seven birdies, and I felt like I didn't -- I missed a lot of opportunities, so there's a lot of them out there.

 Q. Jonathan, good playing. Go work on that putter and keep that low number tomorrow. 
 JONATHAN BYRD: Thanks, appreciate it.
