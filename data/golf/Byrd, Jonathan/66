 Q.  Is there a particular game plan that you've had this week? 
 JONATHAN BYRD:  Just birdies.  I wanted to give myself a lot of chances.  We've got big greens out here.  Try and give myself birdie opportunities.  As good as I roll it, the more opportunities the better. 

 Q.  Just a general recap of the round, good, bad, ugly, plans for tomorrow? 
 JONATHAN BYRD:  Nothing much different.  I always think I can play a little bit tidier tidier here and there.  Today, patience was the key today.  I stayed patient throughout my round and I actually putted well today other than two short putts.  I just hit poor putts.  My head came up and I missed them.  I hit a lot of putts on-line, and I did not do that yesterday.  I keep doing that, I'm going to make a few more.
