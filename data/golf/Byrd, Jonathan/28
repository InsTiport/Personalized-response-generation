 Q. Jonathan, 67 today, maybe not a win, but you've got to be pretty happy with your finish and a Top-10 now in the FedEx?
 JONATHAN BYRD: Today, this week was a great week for me. I've struggled the last seven or eight weeks, missed a lot of cuts, and you know, kind of had a team meeting with my team and got some things squared away and was able to put together a really good week this week. I played really well. 
 Got off to the start. I wanted to try to catch Dustin but middle of the round I just couldn't keep the momentum going.

 Q. Tell me about the golf course, what was it about the golf course that made it fit your eye? 
 JONATHAN BYRD: I really tried to -- some of the holes that didn't fit my eye I just tried to play real simple, like the 10th hole I never tried to hit it over the hill. I just hit my 3-wood down there and took what it gave me. That kind of took some of the uncertainty of the golf course away, the quirkiness. I just had a real simple game plan and I said you know if I make some putts, I'll play good, and I made a good amount of putts. 

 Q. A lot of guys have said quirky for the golf course but it's a cool quirky, you've just got to play the hole -- you play every hole backwards really, know where the pin is on the green. Had to be a lot of fun to play golf that way, because we are not doing it that much on the PGA TOUR right now. 
 JONATHAN BYRD: Quirky is a bad word. I hope that means no disrespect to the members of this golf course. This is a fantastic golf course and it's quirky to us because it's so different than what we normally play, but different in a great way, and I loved it. 
 I had a great time this week. I loved seeing that much slope on the greens, and having to really think of where to hit your shots, and have some difficult chips and two putts. It's a great week.
