Q.   An eagle and three bogeys.
JONATHAN BYRD:   Yeah.   I hadn't had many rounds like that lately.   So it was pretty exciting.   I got off to a good start.   I felt good out there.   I've had good preparation coming into this week.   I had some good work with Mike Bender about a week and a half ago and then Morris Pickens when I got here on Tuesday.
And I feel good about my game, you know, I'm playing under major medical.   So I'm playing for a little more than say the other guys.   I got next season and the medical, so I got a lot on my mind, but it was nice to get off to a good start.

Q.   You're what, about a year removed from wrist surgery now?   How is the injury update?
JONATHAN BYRD:   Yeah.   Almost a year.   October 29th will be the year mark.   The wrist is good.   I still feel things, still have some inflammation at times, but it's strong.   I'm swinging well.   There's not really anything I can't do.   I just have to ice a little bit at the end of the day.

Q.   You gotta have great feelings every time you step on this property, don't you?   Do you ever think about the hole‑in‑one in the playoff?
JONATHAN BYRD:   I do, I do.   But you know, it's funny, like for some reason it's sometimes the last thing I think about, you know, because I think about some par putts I made and some other birdie putts I made to stay in the playoff.
