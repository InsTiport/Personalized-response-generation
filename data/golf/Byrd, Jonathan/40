 Q. Jonathan, another solid day for you?
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, it was solid. Wasn't quite as sharp I guess as yesterday ball-striking because, but I kept giving myself some opportunities and I hit some awful shots today. Really didn't get down on my every, a couple really poor wedge shots. 10, I fatted it and got it halfway up the hill. Poor one on 16. But kept my head up, made a couple birdies coming in and always nice to birdie the last.

 Q. The only bogey was No. 8, was it?
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, No. 8. Short-sided myself to the right and hit a pretty good pitch shot down there and probably should have made the putt. Just hit a poor putt. 

 Q. I bet it's a little easier to stay patient in Hawai'i, isn't it?
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, it's easier to stay patient in had a-we and easier to stay patient on this golf course because you know you have a lot of birdie opportunities and you feel like if you miss one, hey, I've got plenty coming up. So just keep your head up and keep walking.

 Q. You're right there, thoughts on the weekend? 
 JONATHAN BYRD: Not too many. I've got a date tonight with my wife, so excited to do that and wake up tomorrow and it will be another day.
