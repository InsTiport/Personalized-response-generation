Q. Jonathan, 7 birdies and one bogey.  First time you played this course competitively like the rest of the guys but you were able to go low.
How did you do it?
JONATHAN BYRD: Putted well today.  I did a lot of things well.  I hit a lot of good tee shots.  I hit some good scoring clubs irons, 7-irons down.  Gave myself some chances.
I made some birdies on some holes I didn't think I would make birdie, like on 2, 11, out of the gate.  I hit a 4-iron in there about six feet.  I had two putts inside ten feet I missed for birdie.  Other than that, I made most of them.
Q. How about the strong finish because you played the back-9 first so you birdie 7, you birdie 8 but then a great up and down on 9.
I'm guessing from the fairway you thought that approach was going to be pretty good.
JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah.  Mark Flores is from here in Dallas.  Right when I hit it he goes, "Man, that's going to be perfect."  That's just kind of what this golf course gives you.  Every once in awhile you're going to hit a shot if you're trying to use the slopes, you know, sometimes you're going to get too hard a bounce or not enough bounce.  I had a really tough up and down.  Nice to finish with a par.  My goal this week is to try to land the ball to the flat parts.
Q. We've been asking the players about this new venue, about this course.  What do you think?
JONATHAN BYRD: I said it on Monday, I really enjoy it.  I think it's very different than what we see in the States, especially here in Dallas, and I think it's a fun change.
I really love the greens and the complexes and trying to use slopes sometimes and other times you're trying to hit conservative shots to flats.  I think it's very fun.
