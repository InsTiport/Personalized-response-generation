 Q. Good playing today, you got to 8-under and got derailed but a couple of bogeys. Just talk about your round and what your day was like. 
 JONATHAN BYRD: It's a tough golf course out there. I'm a little disappointed with how I finished, but like I said, it's tough. To shoot 1-under in the afternoon today, I think is a good score. Very excited by the fact that I made six birdies out there today. I mean, that shows that I'm doing a lot of good things. 
 Just made some mistakes coming in, just kept kind of fighting hit it the left shot, and it cost me on the tee on 18 and it cost me on a couple iron shots. Missed a few makeable putts. Just didn't make some putts coming in. But overall, played well.

 Q. That bunker shot on the last was pretty impressive, just a shame not to make that putt. Are the greens firming up a lot, very noticeable difference?
 JONATHAN BYRD: Some; some. We get on the front nine thinking the greens were going to get really hard, and they just never got really firm. 
 The putting green was extremely firm and I think they put some extra water on the course in between the two rounds maybe, and that made it a little more playable. 

 Q. You got it up to 8-under par and looked like you had a chance to really run away, but you have to be happy with the round overall. 
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, making six birdies out there today is pretty awesome. 
 Unfortunately I made some tough swings coming in and missed a few putts, but overall I'm playing fantastic and just hopefully it carries over into the weekend. 

 Q. How did it feel to have family around like this and to play so well with them?
 JONATHAN BYRD: It's good. My parents, my brother, my wife's parents, my cousins, uncles, we've got the whole family here this week, and that's fun. It makes it good for off the course. We get some good hang-out time.
