  Q. You're at 6-under, but it seems like almost a day of survival out there. Does that seem appropriate?  
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, pretty much. I think having that wind come up, I think it was -- the wind was difficult today to judge, just the exact direction it was coming from, and then the course browning out and being a lot firmer, you had to be a little sharper today.  
  
  Q. Did the wind seem like the biggest difference between Thursday, Friday and today?  
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, we haven't had any wind the first two days, and it's been humid and the greens have been softer. When that wind comes up, it just makes you think a little bit more, makes it harder to keep the ball in the fairway, and it was a much tougher golf course.  
  
  Q. Seems like by the time these guys come in, you could be in the last two or three groups. Talk about some strategy going into tomorrow. Same thing, survive?   
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, I mean, the strategy is just play the golf course. For me there's not much more than that, just to go play and to stay aggressive. Even though you might give yourself a little more room for error when the greens get firmer, you've still got to make aggressive swings and carefree swings, and that's my whole goal going into tomorrow.  
  
  Q. And good finish last week, you had the momentum going this week. You've got to feel pretty good about where you are.   
 JONATHAN BYRD: Yeah, absolutely. My game has been building all year. I've just gotten some great work in with Mike Bender, my instructor, and Morris Pickens, my golf psychologist, and I feel like I'm doing a lot of things well. Even if I'm not sharp, I still feel like I can hang in there and still play well.
