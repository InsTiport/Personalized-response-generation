  Q.  How did it go for you out there today?   
 JONATHAN BYRD:  You mean the golf course or the crowd?   
  
  Q.  Yeah, the golf course.   
 JONATHAN BYRD:  The golf course, it was a very pleasant day out there today.  I got to the workout trailer this morning at 5:30 a.m., so needless to say it was a long day.  It was cold this morning, but I had a good breakfast and came out this afternoon, not much wind, got some warmth, and the golf course was kind of there for the taking, a lot of birdies to be had out there.   
  
  Q.  Is that a normal thing for you, to work out early?   
 JONATHAN BYRD:  Just to warm up, get your body ready.  When it's that cold out, you want to get everything warmed up.   
  
  Q.  Two back going into the final round.  A lot of guys up there.  It's going to be a good position for you to be right now.   
 JONATHAN BYRD:  I think so.  First tournament of the year at Mercedes I was two back going into the final round.  I played with Daniel Chopra on the last day, who won the golf tournament.  I've already had some experience this year, already in the final group, or second to the last group that week.  I'm hoping that experience will pay off tomorrow.  I did not play my best today.  I did not strike it very well.  Hopefully I'll come out a little sharper tomorrow and keep putting well.   
  
  Q.  Now about the crowd, the people.   
 JONATHAN BYRD:  Well, you hear the crowds are pretty enjoyable.  They come in those last three holes, I think everybody kind of reaches their limit, and if you didn't hit just a perfect shot you got the boos.  I had to really concentrate.  I had to almost imagine I was somewhere else.  I had about a three-footer for par and luckily I made it.
