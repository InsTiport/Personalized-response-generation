I thought I pulled a muscle or tore a muscle during the final round at BellSouth a couple of weeks ago.  I have no idea what happened.  It bothered me some last week, but I got through that.  I saw a doctor at the beginning of this week.  He told me to keep doing what I was doing.  It bothered me on Monday.  I wound up taking Tuesday off, completely.  I went and had an x ray and he gave me some anti inflammatory and told me that it would just need to be rested over time.

I played nine holes on Wednesday at another golf course and that was it.  Yesterday I played really well, but it bothered me a great deal.  After I was finished I went and had an MRI.  Apparently there is a cartilage cap on the rib cage and I have pulled that off somehow, I don't know when it happened or how it happened.  I couldn't swing at all after that.

This is a real tough one to pull out of for several reasons, because it's close to home, because I'm playing well.  I tried everything I could to play, but I just couldn't do it.

I'm going to rest for the next two and a half weeks and hope to be back by Charlotte.  It's really tough because I'm playing so well right now.  I hit it so good yesterday, even with it hurting as bad as it did.
