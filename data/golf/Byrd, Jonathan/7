Q.   What did you hit?
JONATHAN BYRD:   It was 209 downhill, 203 yards and my playing partners hit great shots in there.   Hudson hit one in there about 12 feet, Francesco hit one about 8 feet.   I had good vision of what I wanted to do.   Mine was just on line.   So, landed about two feet short of the hole and went right in.   Saw it go in.   That was my 10th.

Q.   First since the Travelers?
JONATHAN BYRD:   Yeah.   That was lucky No. 7.   Then I made one on 16 at Augusta in the practice round.
