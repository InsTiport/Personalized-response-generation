 Q.  Very well played out there today, a 67.  A bogey at 10, but you fought back very well after that.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I mean, just another pretty solid day, and make a couple bogey today.  You know, trying to get up-and-down and lots of good chance for birdie, as well.   
 Q.  You seemed determine to keep this in the family after your sister won last year, and you are one shot clear now?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm just trying to play my game and have fun out there.  Don't really focus on anything.   
 Q.  Tomorrow the weather is set to change again.  Lots of wind, lot of rain coming.  What are your thoughts about that?  Does that bother you playing in those type of conditions?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I guess everyone is going to play in the same condition.  Just try and get ready for it.   
 Q.  Your sister said it was a fantastic feeling to win in Scotland.  How would it be for you?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, it would be, of course, like any win, you always feel great with it and especially like Scotland is Home of Golf, of course.  I think because she felt like she never played good on a links course, so that's why she kind of pretty surprised what she had done.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you play well on links courses?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know, I just -- to be honest, I don't really focus like what kind of golf course like that week or that day when I play golf.  I just trying to get out and have fun and just -- pretty much just trying to focus on myself and what I feel and what I have to do out there.   
 Q.  She said earlier in the week that you were going to be doing the cooking this week.  Have you been doing the cooking?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I've been doing -- I've been having cooking a lot this week, yeah.   
 Q.  What have you cooked?  She says she was eating it.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: She have to because no one cook.  So she have to eat.   
 Q.  What did you cook?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Some Thai food.  It's pretty much we just get something from the grocery and see what we have that day.   
 Q.  Did you find enough spicy food in Scotland?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't mind if I don't find any spicy.  I don't really eat spicy, anyway.   
 Q.  What was your best highlight today, your best shot today?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know, it's a lot of good shots out there.  I mean, good and bad.  Just not really, it's nothing like really --   
 Q.  Looked like you were rolling the putter well.  What's the longest putt you holed?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know.   
 Q.  Were you happy with your putting?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it's been -- I mean, I still feel good with it.  So I think that's good.   
 Q.  Is it a good rivalry with your sister?  Do you spur each other on; if she wins, you want to win, and when you win, she wants to win?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say we actually grow up really competitive, so we just compete with everything.  For us, it's more like I forgot on what I have to do and like I focus on myself.  She also have something that she have to work on and focus on.   
 Q.  Did you do other sports before golf when you were young?  Were you competitive in other --  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, not before golf, but we do swim a lot and we play tennis, growing up with golf, as well.   
 Q.  Will she cook you a meal if you win?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I would never want to try her food.
