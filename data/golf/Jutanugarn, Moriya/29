MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I mean, it's been long, of course.  But like my ball had a lot of mud on some of the holes.
Q. How were the greens today?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I think because I played in the afternoon, so they get really bumpy and a lot of spike mark.  I mean, they hold up pretty good, but some of the holes just kind of like not -- just kind of like bounce.

Q. Do you think she will be able to close it out tomorrow?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I mean, golf, you never know.  But I mean, as long as -- I mean, how she play right now has been very good.  I think her game is good on this kind of golf course.
