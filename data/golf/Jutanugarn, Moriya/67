Q.   5‑under today, how do you feel like you played out there? 
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I hit it solid.   The ball started to drop in the hole.   So it was great. 

Q.   You had the four‑hour rain delay this morning.   What did you do to kind of kill the time? 
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Well, the first two hours, we delayed, so I just hang around and trying to see if I can go and warm up.   So I warmed up for like 30 minutes and then we got a another two‑hour delay, so I'm like just hang around with my sister, joking around.

Q.   Does having your sister there help you with that to pass the time and kind of keep you loose? 
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah, because she's really funny.   I'm not really funny people but with her I'm just relaxed.

Q.   What was the key to your round today?   What helped you get to 5‑under? 
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I was trying to work on like start the ball on line with my putting because I didn't make the putt.   Like the tournament past, like two, three weeks, so what I try and work is just tempo and just go one shot at a time.

Q.   And then finally, you got your round in today.   A lot of people won't.   Do you think that's going to be an advantage that you finished play today? 
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Well, I think so, yeah.
