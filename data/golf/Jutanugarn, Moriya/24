Q. It was almost a foregone conclusion coming in today that you were going to win.  You didn't know.  Until Inbee finishes, you don't know if you've won it or not.  Were you watching, and how did you feel throughout that process?  You were really far ahead in the points.  Did you know you were far ahead?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I don't know how they count the point so I have no idea.  I just know like I been playing okay in major and I won US Open.  But like I know last night if Inbee win the tournament she going to win the award.
So I didn't expect anything, because if she wins it's like just great for her because she been playing so well.  To me right now I just feel really happy.  I feel like two years ago I come really close but I didn't win the award.
Q. How do you feel now that you have won it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel great.  Feel really honor to join the list of the winner because all the big name.
Q. How does it feel to be linked with Annika?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, I watch Annika since I was young.  She my idol as always.  I'm really like look how she doing and I really want to follow her footstep.
It's amazing for me.
