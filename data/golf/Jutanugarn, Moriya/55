Q. Like you said, best round of your life, or best round on tour at least.  Just talk to me about how it felt out there.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, I didn't hit it any better today.  Just start make the putt like a lot more.  I had a really comfortable feeling like seeing the ball going in the hole.
Actually it work out pretty good.
Q. Did you feel like that going into the round, like putting pretty good on the putting green?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  Just kind of like keep it going in the golf course.  Well, you know, it's like everything is kind of like going pretty smooth.
Yeah, that's what I say.  like I been hitting pretty solid this week, so I don't hit anything better today.  Just start making the putt.
Q. Caught up to your sister a little bit as well.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, getting closer.  We'll see.
Q. You're tied right now.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Oh, really?
Q. Yes.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well she still has a lot of hole, so I don't know.  We'll see.
Q. Are you going to go watch her now?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: To be honest, I have to go pack.  For her also.  Like for myself and for her and then probably come back and like pick her up.
Q. Is that something you do a lot, if she's been in the lead you go pack the bags?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it happens to me last time in Australia like when she was tied for lead and I was like have to try to figure out what I'm going to do because we fly out Sunday night.
So I go back to the hotel, pack everything, go back to the golf course, and pick her up.  Yeah, I do that couple time.
Q. Has she done that for you?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Not yet.  Hopefully this year.
