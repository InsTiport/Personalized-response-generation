 Q.  Mo, congratulations, a nice win against Michelle Wie your first victory in the singles at the UL International Crown.  How do you feel?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It's great.  I been playing good, like I hit it solid and hit a lot of good shot; gave myself a lot of good chances.   
(Wind interference.)   
 Q.  And Thailand winning in the playoff, Ariya chipping in for eagle, how thrilling was that?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It was great.  I know I hit a really good shot, but then she just take off and I was like, Okay, fine.  So I didn't really have to do anything.  I think I hit a good shot.   
You know, I think that's just how we have to play as a team, like helping each other.
