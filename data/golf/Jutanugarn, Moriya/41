 Q.  Wasn't the result you were hoping for but you've got to be happy with how you played today?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, really happy, and it's so much fun today.  You know, I made a lot of good putts, a lot of good shots out there.  I'm pretty happy with what's happened.   
 Q.  How was it playing with Shanshan in front of some of the Chinese fans here?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It was great.  I know it's like her home country.  Of course everybody is cheering for her.  I mean, Shanshan is a great player, and very happy for her that she played really solid.  I mean, she had a really good week in her home country, which is really cool.   
 Q.  You were in it right till the very last putt.  What were you thinking walking down 18 and as you lined up the final putt?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I was just trying to give myself a chance.  It's a pretty good chance out there.  As long as I try to give myself a chance, I think it's a pretty good thing to do.   
 Q.  You've got to be feeling motivated and happy just with one more tournament left to go.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, of course.  I'm very ready for another week, and then, you know, for my off-season.  It will be nice just to get some rest finally.   
 Q.  How was it having your sister following you for the final two holes today, and I know you guys played a lot this week together.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I've been together -- we've been together a lot, like 24 hours for the first few days.  Like the last two holes, I see her, it's kind of pretty funny because I see her a lot.  But it's pretty nice to see her on the golf course and come and watch.   
She did the same thing in Evian.
