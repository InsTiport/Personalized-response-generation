 Q.  A 71 today, bit of a tough start, but you battled hard on the back nine.  How do you think it overall went today?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It was a tough day for everyone.  It's just kind of, you know, get good weather on the front nine and it's getting like, you know, pouring rain on the back.  Just trying to hang in there.  I mean, it's just like got a pretty bad start but trying to get back and just give myself a chance out there.   
 Q.  You made a couple of birdies early on on the back nine.  Do you think you were in with a chance?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I was just trying to focus on myself and play my game and try and have fun.  Don't really focus on what's on the lead or anything.  I just think if I play good golf, it should be a good chance.   
 Q.  You came tied second this week.  You must be happy with that performance.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, pretty happy.  It's just been working on a lot of things, and since like everything is kind of tighted up, you know, it's a lot of good things to take from this week.   
 Q.  Have you got any other plans?  Have you got a few weeks off?  When is your next tournament?
