Q. 30 on the front; had it going for a little bit.  What was the key to today for you?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, I mean, these major events, the keys are fairways and greens this week.  Just trying to give myself a chance for birdie.  It looks like it's plenty of good chances out there today.  I rolled the ball very good, and just trying to keep going and like see a good shot and just relax on the golf course.
Q. Obviously you didn't play yesterday, so what did you do yesterday while you were waiting?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, it was being updated everyone in hours, and I was waiting in the hotel room.  So yeah, that's what I do.  Just watching the rain and waiting in the room, take one nap yesterday.
Q. You get storms like that at home, do you?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It's more like thunderstorm, like lightning and stuff like that, but it's gone fast.  In Thailand it's kind of like, boom, and then gone.
Q. Can you just update us on what you've been working on with Pia of late?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It's been the same thing, just working on commitment every shot, relax on the golf course, play happy.
Q. Do you go to the Tuk Tuk restaurant every night?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: No, we've been there one time this week.  We've been there once already.  It's just busy.  It's a pretty small place, but pretty nice to have Thai in town.
Q. How did you find the conditions on the course today?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, we always get a lot of rain this tournament.  It's been pretty soft, like fairway and green been pretty soft, but they're not really bad.  Like I expect it's going to be worse than today.
Q. I know you've helped your sister a lot over the years; has she talked to you anything about getting over the hump and winning, and is she giving you any advice, too?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, she says -- that's actually what I'm trying to do, just keep knocking the door, and when it's time, it's time.  You know, just trying to keep playing solid, and she just says play happy this year, I see you playing better, and when it's time, everything comes together, it could be my week.
Q. Are you being pretty patient?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I try a lot.  You know, like cross fingers, even can be patient like this for a little while.  It should be good.
Q. What kind of input do your parents have because your father used to help you and say, go out and hit some shots.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, maybe not a lot with me.  Maybe with my sister a lot more, because my dad would travel with my sister a lot more.  I'm pretty much with my mom, so I don't really hang out with him on the golf course that much.
Q. He travels more with --
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: With my sister.
Q. And you travel more with your mother?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.
Q. How does that work?  How was that decided?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Because, I don't know, I feel a little more stress things when I was younger when I played junior golf with my dad in the same group as I play, and I feel more stressed.  So I was like, maybe mom walk with me I feel better, so I think that's how we started.
Q. When your mother watches you, she doesn't make you stressed.  Does she make you laugh, or how does she keep you happy?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't really see her on the golf course.  Pretty much she just like walks ahead and doesn't like bother anybody, like bother me.  Pretty much she just like -- it's more like she keeps walking ahead.
Q. Does she watch you or is she walking too far ahead?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know.  I'm not sure.  Like last time I made hole-in-one in Kia this year, and I asked her, do you see it, because she walked in a group, and she's like, I have no idea if she watches golf.
