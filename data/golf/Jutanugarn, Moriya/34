Q. You were so close, you gave it a good run today.  Can you tell me about your day and how proud you are of how you played?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, it was the first major of the year, and I finished Top 10.  It's always great to see your name on the leaderboard.  Of course, I don't get bored with that.  I had fun.  I had a lot of fun this week, and out there I feel more comfortable.  Just wait until the ball dropped in a the hole a little bit more, and maybe there would be a good chance for me.
Q. How hard is it to win out here, especially at a major?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, every week all the girls -- I feel like everybody on this Tour can win.  It could be anybody every week.  I think it's just a lot of competition, and I enjoy doing that.  Actually, all the girls kind of compete but then they're nice to each other, and that's how we are on the LPGA.
