 Q.  You're 3 under overall, right?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Right. Even today.   
 Q.  Even today. You're right in. Anything could happen, a low day tomorrow, even a low day Sunday. How much momentum can a shot like that get you kind of amped for tomorrow?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It just feels like all day today I don't really have a good moment for the game. Just kind of like it's one of the days that like I hit it good but it kind of like -- you know, like one inch or a one footer to be a really good shot. Like it just gets really close.   
It feels like I still hit a lot of good shots and lots of good putts, so I'm just trying to take that in and carry on.   
 Q.  And the wind, how much of a factor was that out there? Especially it got a little gusty at times.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, there's some gusts there and blowing sometimes as well. But, I mean, I just feel that I have to be patient with it. Sometimes it's fun to play in the wind as well, but just got to be patient with it and basically just take what we got.
