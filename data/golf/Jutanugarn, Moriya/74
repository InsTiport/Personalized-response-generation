Q.   Awesome round here.   You've never played here before, have you?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   No.

Q.   So what did you think of the course setup?   How did you think your game set up to it?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   You know, this course is going to be really windy in the afternoon, so we're lucky because we played in the morning.   Anyways, my game today, I hit the tee shots like in the‑‑ I hit it in the fairway a lot, so it kept me in the places that are easy to play.   But the greens were kind of getting firmer and firmer, and it's more‑‑ you have to see like‑‑ it's in good shape, but you have to see like where you can miss it and where you cannot. 

Q.   You played with NaYeon and Juli?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah.

Q.   Have you played with them before?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah, I've played with them before.   They are really nice to me every time I played with them.   Juli is like a big sister on Tour because I know her for like ever.   I know her a long, long time.

Q.   Since when did you guys meet? 
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I met Juli my first time I caddied for my sister on the LPGA in Thailand. 

Q.   How old were you then?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I was like 13 when I'm a caddie for my sister.

Q.   She was really nice to you guys then?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah, she's like a big sister.   Anyway, I just asked her everything when I have a problem, and she's trying to help.

Q.   What's the biggest thing she's helped you with, just golf stuff or off the course stuff?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I mean, everything, like I had a question I asked Juli, you know like my first year on Tour, so we have to learn a lot and make sure you ask and then you have a good answer.

Q.   What's been some of the advice do you think she's given you?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I ask her a lot, like about the caddie, when I start to find a caddie.

Q.   Did you find a caddie?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah.   And whatever I ask her, and she's going to email me back every time I asked her.

Q.   You send her emails?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah.

Q.   Talk about your round.   What did you think was really looking for you? 
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   What is working for me?   I think my tee shots kept me in good places to play because there's a lot of heavy rough and really long rough, and if you get in trouble, it's that. 
    Anyway, I played solid today, and my putting is working pretty good.

Q.   Your sister missed out on the qualifier?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   She missed by one, yeah. 

Q.   So is she here?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   She is here with us, but she didn't go walk today, like she didn't want to watch today.

Q.   She took a day off?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   She took a day off, just do some, like, workout or whatever.

Q.   Having her around and not necessarily playing, do you think that helps you play better or get extra attention because the eyes are on you?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   It's different.   I mean, every time when we play, it was the same tournament.   We try to beat each other all the time.   So yeah, we either play together or same tournament. 

Q.   Talk about Rookie of the Year.   Is that a goal of yours coming into the season? 
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I try to play well all the time.   Anyway, I'm trying to keep myself relaxed and play one shot at a time, whatever, and the Rookie of the Year, I mean, the rookie is‑‑ I mean, it's the thing like come after we play good; you know what I mean? 

Q.   It'll be the product of you playing well?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah, like after you play good, so you can get there.   Anyway, I try to keep focused on my game, and I'm really happy with my position right now. 

Q.   Looking at the list of past rookies of the year, it's pretty awesome, Annika, Lorena, crazy really good names.   How cool would that be? 
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I'm getting nervous every time when I had a speech, even when I won the junior even, like a long time ago when I played junior golf events, I was like getting nervous, and when I said a speech, my sister said are you crying up there?   I said, I'm not, I'm just nervous. 
    But yeah, I try to figure out how to get myself better.   But you know what, like Lorena Ochoa used to be the Rookie of the Year, but they are also my idols, so I try to keep that‑‑

Q.   How are you feeling?   You said you were a little sick?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   It's getting much better before I played on Wednesday because I take all the medicine, so it's okay right now.   It's better.

Q.   So coming into this week were you worried?   Were you thinking, oh, my gosh, I might not be able to play?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   I kind of worried a little bit because I see the course when I played the pro‑am, and I played yesterday early before the pro‑am, nine holes, and when I turned to the back nine today, I was like, oh, my God, I can't remember, like how is the layout.

Q.   You put your caddie to work and he obviously did a pretty good job, right?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah, he did.   He did a good job this week.   I just asked him like I can't remember where I have to go, something like that.

Q.   Do you guys laugh about that when he's like, okay?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   He just told me okay, where is a safe target. 

Q.   So coming in you had really not a clue about the course or anything, so do you think that helps you coming in?
    MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Maybe, because you know‑‑ maybe it helps because I kind of‑‑ myself, I just like worry all the time.   So if you can't remember the course so you just ask the caddie and trust him and try to play one shot at a time, maybe it helps me game.
