  Q. Great playing this week.  Obviously not necessarily the final round you were hoping for, but top 10 finish, tied for sixth in this year's U.S. Women's Open.  What does that mean to you?
 MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Well, you know, of course it's always feel great to come back for U.S. Open, and it's like one of the probably toughest setup like of the year for sure.
 I'm pretty happy with how I play because I just pretty much just really like not expecting as much like earlier this week.  I didn't hit it that good last week and I'm just starting to come back from, you know -- I actually took maybe like five weeks off.
 So, yeah, pretty happy with the result.
 Q. Overall just how hard were the conditions today with the weather being so cold in that final round?
 MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Well, the tee move up a lot, too, but like some of the pin is just like it's hard to get into it with like the long irons that I have to hit into the green.
 And I'll say it's really -- I mean, it's just like with the cold and a little bit windy, it just make the condition a lot tougher.
 Q. Overall what do you take away as a player from a confidence level to finish in the top 10 of a major championship?
 MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Actually just what I say.  I don't expect much early in this week because I don't feel that good, to be honest.
 But like after four round of golf I actually feel a lot better, a lot more solid, and just keep working on the same things, and just hopefully have another good week or like feeling good next week and finish for this season with a good feeling.
