Q. Second-place finish for you.  Maybe a little sad, but you still got to feel great about how well you played this week?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: No, I don't sad at all.  Like playing with Jess is cool and she's doing great.  I mean, it's very happy to see she's playing well.  I mean, also I'm very enjoy everything this week.  Whatever it's happen this week, it's cool.
Q. I've asked the question a couple times, but what was the support like out there?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, like I make a putt for eagle on 15, and like Jess was like, Oh, my God.  Like all the crowd was like really loud.  That's kind of shock for me.  She's like, This is a really cool place to play.  There is a lot of support out there.
Q. So around 9, 10, you were within two, three strokes.  It was really close.  Did you know how close it was there?
