 Q.  What a great week for you.  You played really well all week?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't think I played bad today.   
 Q.  What in particular today do you think was the difference?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Today?  Well, you know, like I've been playing in the final group always a pleasure, but I learned so much from playing today.  Actually I feel like I hit it pretty good.  Just probably not really my day.  Like a lot of lip-outs.  Hit a lot of good putts out there, a lot of good shots.  Just kind of bounce -- had a bad bounce or something like that.   
So it's probably not really my time yet.   
 Q.  What's your biggest thing you learned from being in the position you were this week?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I always learn every week when I play, and especially in the final group.  What I learned this week, you know, is play in the last group in a major event is great.  I think I learned to be a lot patient, just how I can relax on the golf course and just have fun with the game and just be myself and play my game.   
 Q.  How did it feel where you were the one playing in the last group and May was the one watching you walking around?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I tell May, I ask her this morning, I was like, "Are you going to walk?"   
And she's like, "Yeah, I'll walk."   
I was like, "Yeah, I want you to walk with me."   
It's great.  It's really, really good support.   
 Q.  Did you have -- did you talk to anyone before the round, like in preparation to get ready?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Just talk to May a little bit.  Like he just say, you know what, just go out and enjoy it, play your game and whatever is going to happen is going to happen.   
 Q.  What's next for you for the rest of the season?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to start and play Korea and probably play to CME.   
 Q.  What will you do between now and Korea?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I have three weeks off.  Going back to Thailand, of course.  You know, it's been a long time I haven't go back to Thailand, so I'm excited to go back home.  Just relax a little bit.
