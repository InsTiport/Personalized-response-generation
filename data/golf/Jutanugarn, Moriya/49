 Q.  5- under.  Good score to start out.  How do you feel about your round?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, a lot of good chances; I feel I could make a little more.  5-under is still a pretty good round.  Pretty happy with it, you know.   
I mean, as long as I know what I have to improve a little bit more.  Kind of tighten it up.   
 Q.  What do you have to improve on?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I hit a lot of good shot today.  Some of the putt didn't go in.  Just kind of speed and line doesn't match.  I mean, it's happen with all the players, but I think everything is been pretty good.   
 Q.  How does this course set up for you?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, it's always very nice to come back on this golf course.  I know we have tournament here for a long time.  You know, like see all the big tree.  It's just like a different style.  Just more like a little old-style and different than other.   
But it's really nice.   
 Q.  You've got your Vision 54 team here.  What kind of advice have they been giving you this week?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, we working on like commitment with putting and full shot, which is -- you know, try to work on it, so hopefully it's getting better and better.
