 Q.  Round one in the bag in Thailand.  How was it out there?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It was good. I wasn't really nervous, but more excited, you know on the tee, on the 1st hole.  Lots of fans came.  I didn't think there were going to be as much because it's the first round, you know.   
Yeah, it's fun.  You know, I mean, I had a lot of up and down, left and right, but it's fine.   
 Q.  Were you nervous at all on the 1st tee?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I say it was more exciting.  You know, kind of nervous.   
 Q.  Your sister said that you and Pornanong had the most fans.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know.  I mean, I wish.   
 Q.  Up hope so, yeah.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I wish.   
 Q.  How are you enjoying the week?  Is it busy?  A lot of sponsor obligations?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, it's of course a busy week for us, but we try to enjoy it.  Every moment here is always great.  Fan support, great golf course, playing in our home country.  Nothing much that you can ask for.   
 Q.  What's something that golf fans of yours that have never come to Thailand, what do you want them to know about Thailand and Thai golf?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: To play golf in Thailand I think is paradise.  You know, I mean, coming out here, you have nice service, the carry.  You know, everybody (indiscernible) not like when you play in the U.S. where you carry your own bag.   
And of course good food after the round.  Maybe some Thai massage.  What's better than that, you know?   
 Q.  Okay.  Awesome.  Cool.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Thank you.
