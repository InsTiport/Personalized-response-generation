 Q.  4-under today after 5-under yesterday.  Looks like you played really well on the front side of the course.  What do you like about that side in particular?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I don't know about like front side or the back side because I just mean like -- yesterday my front nine was like great.  I was making a lot of putts.  It just feels like I hit it anywhere on the green and I'm trying to make a putt.  Today I hit it good, like I had so many good chances for birdie, and I keep like burning the edge and missing them.  It's just more like patience out there.  I don't know that I play good on the front side, but it's just more like -- I think it's just the timing.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you're at a point right now where you're not really thinking as much but you can still go out and play well every single day?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I think that's the way everybody should play golf.  Like you don't have to be thinking so much, just being focused on what we have to do.  You know, I mean, I think everybody -- even other players, you know, the game is right there.  It just depends on how you think about that situation.   
 Q.  Has that been something that Pia and Lynne have been really huge for you to get to there?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, it is a big change, but it's not like change in five minutes, you know, or like a one day.  Yeah, it's been like working on a lot of bad, and because I've been really perfectionist, and it's so hard for me to just let it go, and when I hit a bad shot or something like that.  So we've been working.  I'm still being myself on the golf course.
