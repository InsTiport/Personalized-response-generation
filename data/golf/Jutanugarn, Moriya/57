 Q.  You said you were tired but how happy are you with this performance you've put in this week.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm very happy with what it is this week.  I really happy that I can perform in front of Thai fans and play in the last group with great two players and in home country.  It's just great.   
 Q.  How exciting was that experience playing in the last group?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It is pretty exciting.  I don't really play that often, but like I play with Amy and So Yeon, and it's like great people.  We are really nice to each other.  That's kind of made me more relax and we have fun out there.   
 Q.  Seemed like you had great camaraderie out there.  This is your first top-10 finish since Arkansas last June.  How good does it feel to be back up there?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, I keep playing solid starting Bahamas and Australia last week.  You know, now it's good time to play good in home country.  I think it's still feel pretty good and trying to keep playing.   
 Q.  You're gathering a lot of momentum.  T-16 in the Bahamas and Australia; finished seventh here in Thailand.  Must be very confident for the rest of the season.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, so for so good.  Now I just try keep on working and keep work on (indiscernible).  I don't want to be like too straight like putting pressure on myself.  Just like enjoy and play golf.
