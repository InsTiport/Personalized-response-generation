Q.   We are here with Moriya and Ariya Jutanugarn, after having the match today at the first day of the International Crown.   Take us through your experience, how was it today?   You were the first to tee off Moriya.   How did it feel out there? 
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   It was pretty nice being the first person.   It was exciting and a little bit nervous, because she told me like, You go ahead, because I'm getting nervous, just make sure you hit it in the fairway and then I'll be fine. 
So, yeah, we had a pretty good game today, yeah. 

Q.   Were you two nervous to tee off, is that why you had your sister do it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah, only the first tee, and then like I will help her like not at all.   She played so good and she helped me a lot on the front nine.   Like her putting was really good today and everything was like really good.

Q.   What was it like hearing your National Anthem out there today?   Was it emotional? 
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Well, actually it was my first time after turning pro, so we just played for Thailand.   It's really exciting, everything, because we play against Spain today and they played really good.   They had a good game.   So they were consistent. 

Q.   Strategy heading into tomorrow?   After today, do you feel good, does this change your approach? 
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Like my back nine getting better, so I feel a lot better like more confident.   But tomorrow we have to figure out like who we're going to play with together. 

Q.   Excited heading into tomorrow? 
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah, we're really excited to get some more points, because we need some more.
