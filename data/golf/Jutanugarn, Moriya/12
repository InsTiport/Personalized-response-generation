Q. How did it go out there?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, it's good.  I just, you know, pretty much the same thing.  Like hit it left, right, something like that.  But you know, try to get myself finish 18.  It was good.
Q. Hot out there?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It's quite hot, yeah.  A bit windy, too, today.
Q. Is the course playing quite hard?  A lot of the girls have said it's harder than last year maybe.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It feels like the green is more firm, so it's just harder to, you know, like to put the ball where you want it to, and sometime, especially like the rough, seems a bit longer, too, and if you doesn't get a really good lie, it's harder to stop it on the green.
Q. And the run-offs from the green have been shaved, so it's rolling off a bit more?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Right.  Yeah, like some of the green is like they are run now and you have to be careful with that, too.
Q. Is it playing longer, the course, a little bit?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Do you know, I'm not sure.  I feels like I hit everything shorter, so it seems like it's longer.
Q. What did you do especially well today?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know, I was trying to keep myself, hit it fairway and green and trying to give myself a chance of birdie.  You know, make some, miss some, but missed some of the putt.  But you know, just finish 18 today and I'm happy.
