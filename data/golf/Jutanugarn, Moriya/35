Q. How was your round?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Good.  You know, I didn't hit it like great, but it was good enough to give myself a chance for birdie.  It's a little bit of a roller coaster up-and-down from the start.  But just keep myself a little focused, and like it's fun to get up-and-down.
Q. You had a lot of birdies on the back nine; was there a highlight of your day?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, actually four birdies on the front too, but with four bogies.  So it seems like I just kept rolling and played good.  It seemed pretty solid.  I'm pretty happy today.
Q. How good was it to finish your day with a birdie in front of the crowd on 18?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It's nice.  Always nice to see the crowd on 18 with really big grand stands and hospitality on the last hole.  It seems like it's feeling like a major week, you know.  Anyway, it is a major, but just like the feeling of everything's kind of set up great.
Q. We talk to you all the time about when you're going to win.  Are you feeling any pressure?  Do you think you put yourself in a good spot for tomorrow?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I mean, like I've been in a little trouble two weeks ago, and then trying to get back to what I should feel and work on that a lot.  This week actually seems like getting back to -- it's not where I was, but at least it feels better.  My mind's not like everywhere on the golf course.  At least I can focus better, and that's what I'm working on.  Hopefully if it continues being better and better, so maybe it will come soon.
