Q. Very well played, a round of 7-under.  You've been playing well recently.  Tell me about your day.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It's been nice, like nice weather.  It seems like get a lot of good bounce, as well.  It's been a pretty solid round and finally make some putts.
Q. It rained a lot in the build up to this week.  How has the course handled the water?  Are the greens running okay?  Are the fairways playing okay?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Everything seems pretty nice, you know, like green rolling pretty nice, a bit slow, but just kind of normal on a links course.  Greens not too firm today, so it's pretty nice for us to play.  Everything was pretty nice.
Q. Knowing that the weather is good today and awful tomorrow, did you go and play it a bit more aggressively today to try and make those birdies?  Did you change your game in any way?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: No, just want to enjoy out there.  Actually just, you know, like want to play my game.  I did.  I enjoy and I had fun.  I don't know what's going to happen next couple days, but you know, I really enjoyed today.
Q. Scottish people call it liquid sun; we call it rain.  How do you prepare for conditions like tomorrow, heavy wind and strong rain?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I guess just nothing to do.  Nothing much to do about it.  Just kind of, you know, go out and wear your rain jacket and just be patient.
