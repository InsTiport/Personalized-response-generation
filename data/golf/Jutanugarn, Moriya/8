 Q.  Had you started your round before the delay or you were after?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I was on first hole on the green.   
 Q.  You were on the green, so you had hit shots before the first delay?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Hit a couple shot.   
 Q.  Okay.  How were those shots?  What did you do on 1?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, when I start, it was like, well, you know before, really hard, it was like blowing and like pouring.  I was okay.  Like trying to keep myself in the fairway and green.   
 Q.  Were you able to do that?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I hit -- I mean, I hit it okay off the tee and then not very good shot on the second.  Then I hit it on the green and then I was about to putt.   
 Q.  How long was the putt you had when you came back?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I think it was about 25- to 30-footer.   
 Q.  For birdie?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: For birdie.   
 Q.  And you made a par?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I made a par.   
 Q.  No bogeys through two rounds?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Really?   
 Q.  Yeah.  How happy are you with the way you're playing?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I was just trying to be patient and I mean, I've been working on lots of things in the past.  It seems like everything's feeling better.  Like just myself, feeling better.  I don't know what's going on out there.  Just like trying to keep doing what I want to do.   
 Q.  What's the main thing that you've been working on?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually a lot.  I mean, I've been working on my swing.  I've been working on, you know, mental, like lots of things going on in my mind, trying to get out there and just play simple golf as much as I can.   
 Q.  How difficult is that when you have some of the conditions like you saw today:  Sun, rain, wind?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I don't want to complain about anything because it's something you can't control, and also I think I'm pretty lucky as I'm in the afternoon today.  Just want to say, no complaints.  It's tough out there and I actually feel bad for the girls, everyone's playing in the morning.  It was so tough.  I think they hang in there and they do a good job.   
 Q.  You had an eagle until your round today?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: One eagle.   
 Q.  What was the details on that?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I mean, I was hit it in the rough, but like lucky enough, get a good lie.  Just hit 3-wood out.  I don't see it and it come out about 10-footer, like pin-high.   
 Q.  You made the putt?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Made the putt.
