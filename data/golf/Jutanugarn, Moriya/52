Q. Heading into the final round two strokes off the lead.  How do you feel?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, I feel great.  I been playing pretty sold.  Been a lot of patient out there today.  The winds pick up in the afternoon and then the greens starting to be like bumpy, like a lot more people walk around.
So just have to be a lot of patient.  You know, like it's hang in there today; tomorrow if I have a solid day it would be good for me.
Q. How was it?  There is quite a large crowd following you all day.  How was that?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It was fun.  They always had a really good feedback here, like people come and watch a lot.
Yeah, it's really fun, especially like the girl I play with, like they all nice and really playing good.  That's make the crowd even more fun.
Q. What's the game plan heading into tomorrow?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, you know, just keep playing my game.  You know, I want to be myself on the golf course and just having fun.
I just hope I play another solid day.
