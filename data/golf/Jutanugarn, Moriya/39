 Q.  Moriya, pretty much the ideal start.  Right at the top of the pack at the moment.  What was going right for you out there?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually pretty good start today, and also it's better than I expected.   
 Q.  What did you do in your off-season to get yourself so ready to start firing this week?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Most of the time just rest; no golf.  You know, maybe eat Thai food at home.  That's what I do for off-season.   
 Q.  How good is the Thai food here this week?  How many of your family members are out watching?  There was a huge crowd today.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, always a huge crowd.  You know, it's like friends and family come and always feel really warm welcome.   
 Q.  If you were going to guess, how many rounds do you think you've played on this golf course before?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I pretty much play LPGA almost every year, but when I'm in Thailand I don't play this golf course much.   
 Q.  Fair enough.  Looked like a pro out there today.  Great job.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Thank you.   
 Q.  Great 6-under round for Moriya Jutanugarn.  Right at the top of the leaderboard.  You said you had a 4-foot putt on 18 for birdie.  Had to feel good to do that here in front of your home crowd.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Here is always great to play and come back here again.  It's one of my favorite week.  You know, just don't really expect that much.  Just trying to go out and have fun today.   
 Q.  Did you know that putt was for a tie of the lead?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I was just trying to focus on what I have to do and just play my game.  You know, hopefully it's help, and work out pretty good.   
 Q.  Definitely worked out pretty good.  How do you now rest and recuperate for tomorrow's round given how hot it is out here?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It's pretty hot.  It's going to be a lot of rest this afternoon and also just get ready for tomorrow.
