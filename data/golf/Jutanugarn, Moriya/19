 Q.  What was the key to your round today?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It's nothing much.  I struggled a little bit and I just want to go out and trust what I'm doing today.  To be honest, no expectation.  I just want to play without expectation.  Like even with people around and myself, as well, just want to trust myself to keep going.   
 Q.  You said you were struggling.  What were you struggling with?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Just not like struggle but I'll say I didn't feel great.  Like just been working on some things, but when it's in between, that doesn't feel comfortable on the golf course.   
So I just want to trust myself and just keep hitting golf shots, like one shot at a time.   
 Q.  How many weeks have you been in a row now?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Four.  This is my fourth week.   
 Q.  And are you playing the next two?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm not playing next week.  I'll play Blue Bay.   
 Q.  So trying to take advantage before you go off again and come back?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, like just want to finish this week with whatever I feel good with, and then just start it again in Blue Bay.   
 Q.  What do you think is the key that you need to play well on this golf course?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I think my key is nothing much.  Just, again, no expectation.  I just want to go out and see what I can do out there.  It's not like -- it's not key, like any key.  Just want to work on myself.
