 Q.  How was the course playing for you?  You looked like you enjoyed it out there.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, just trying to play one shot at a time, and it kind of made my day shorter.  You know, just try and be patient because it seems like the golf course played a bit longer, had a lot longer irons into the greens.  You just have to be patient.   
 Q.  It is a really busy schedule right now; how are you feeling?  Was it important to you to start this week very well given the fact that it has been an intense couple of weeks?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I mean, I was pretty happy with my start today, but it's golf.  You never know what's going to happen.  I mean, just trying to keep playing my game, being happy and having fun out there.   
 Q.  It's always such a big event, the last major of the season, the British Open, big crowds tend to gather here at Woburn.  Is it a week that you've been looking forward to, and how has it lived up to your expectations this first day?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, it's just like for me, it's like another big week, and of course just trying to prepare as much as I can, and then the rest, just let it happen.  I don't know what's going to happen, but just try and have fun.
