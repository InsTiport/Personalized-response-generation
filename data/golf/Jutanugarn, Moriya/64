 Q.  One or probably two back maybe heading into the final day.  You've got to like where you're standing?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I like it a lot.  Like I had a pretty solid game this week, and hopefully I keep it solid tomorrow for my game and keep doing what I'm doing right now and stick with my game plan.   
 Q.  You had the bogey early, birdie, bogey -- birdie, bogey and then had the eagle to rebound.  How did you rebound?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say that is not -- I would say like I'm not really like that tee shot because I hit it in the bunker twice that hole, and somehow I had a good third shot and just, you know what, it goes in, I can't even see it.   
 Q.  What happened?  Can you run us through that eagle?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I hit it in the bunker in the left side off the tee and I tried to get my 6-iron just to lay up to like across the water hazard.  I hit my pitching wedge in like the third shot.  I mean, like I see a really good shot and I'm like, that looks good, and I think maybe it's pretty close.   
 Q.  How far was it?  Do you remember?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: The third shot, it's like 110.   
 Q.  And did you feel like a good week like this was coming on?  Did you see signs in your game that made you think that a good week like this was coming?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I just keep on what I have to do and it work out pretty good.  Hopefully tomorrow I stick with my game plan and pretty solid.   
 Q.  Did you have as much fun without your sister out there today?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, like always when you play good and you're having fun with your golf game, but I would say yesterday I had more fun with my sister.
