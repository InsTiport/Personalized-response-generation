THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome into the media center the Jutanugarn sisters, Moriya and Ariya Jutanugarn.  Welcome ladies.  Thanks for joining us today.   
I will start with Moriya actually.  So you're No. 13 in the world now making your sixth start here at Evian.  Last year you played really, really well.  How are you feeling going into this week?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Great to come back here in Evian.  Always like really good week.  I'm looking forward to come back, you know.   
Golf course in really good shape this week, too.  I'm very excited.   
THE MODERATOR: You were leading going into the final round last year.  What do you remember about your play last year?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: What I remember is my sister walking on the golf course watching me playing.  I mean, a lot of good memories on this golf course.  I really like this golf course and this town, too.   
THE MODERATOR: You're making your fourth start here; best finish was T9 in 2016.   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: How about last year?   
THE MODERATOR: How about last year?  Oh, I don't remember.  But this year you have a great chance to win.  You're leading in almost every single category on the LPGA:  Player of the Year, Race to CME Globe, money.  What has the season been like for you?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: So far it's pretty good.  I feel like I improve a lot of thing I been working on and I really happy about what I been doing.  You know, like because I try so hard to work on my short game the last few month, and I hope it's going to get better soon.   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I hope.   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hope.   
THE MODERATOR: Do you think that's really important here, short game?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Of course.  I think tee shot going to be pretty important too because the fairway is pretty narrow and the rough even longer than last year and the year before.   
THE MODERATOR: I know you guys spend a lot of time together.   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Too much.   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Sometimes.   
THE MODERATOR: What do you guys do for fun here in France?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: We went to town every tight and sometimes we just like walk around the lake.  That call lake?  Yeah.  We have ice cream every day, cake every day, and I love it.   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: And she gain weight for sure.   
THE MODERATOR: What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like yogurt, chocolate.  I like everything.  I keep trying and have almost everything soon.  Today.   
THE MODERATOR: How about you, Mo?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I actually pretty much follow her.  She had a plan.  You know, after she left the golf course she had a plan for every day.   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel I have to plan for dinner like Friday, Saturday, Sunday.   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Already.  That's what she talking about.   
THE MODERATOR: Really?  Is that what you normally do?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  I'm really stressed on the course and I'm just always thinking about what I'm going to eat.  (Laughter.)   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: That's what she do on the golf course.  (Laughter.)   
THE MODERATOR: Awesome.  We'll open it up to questions.   
 Q.  Not enough has been made I think over here of you guys being the first sisters to win.  What's it been like at home in Thailand?  Has it been a bigger deal there?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it's been pretty big deal in Thailand.  I'm pretty sure they get pretty exciting like us as well.   
I feel like even in Thailand right now golf is very grow, like grow up a lot.  I think that's make us feels like to be out here just want to be a good role model for them as well.   
 Q.  Last week in tennis we had the US Open, and of course you had the Williams sisters playing against each other again.  That's become standard for the last decade that they'll eventually meet.  You guys have never met in the final round of any championship, much less a major.  What happens coming down the stretch if you're pitted against each other?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to try to beat her.   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say the same thing.  I mean, I always try to beat her anyway.   
THE MODERATOR: So you guys are looking at each other's scores every day?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I did all the time.  I don't think she did, but I did.  So I keep like looking the score.  Like how my sister doing?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I check her score, but it's not like trying to beat her.  Just want to know where she is, you know?  Yeah.   
 Q.  Next week is the Thai LPGA Masters in Bangkok, and Arpichaya Yubol is trying to win her sixth consecutive title.  At the Open, we had a Thai best amateur.  How do you think the strength overall of Thailand golf is now for the ladies compared to what it was when you first started?  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: To me it's much stronger for sure.  We got a lot of new generation, also like (indiscernible) and also like a lot of girls, not just her back at home.   
I think they doing pretty good for the future.  I'm pretty sure we going to get a better and better players.   
THE MODERATOR: Speaking of Thailand golf, we are getting closer to closer to the UL International Crown that you guys are playing in.   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm ready.   
THE MODERATOR: Are you ready?  Mo, are you ready for UL International Crown?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Of course.   
THE MODERATOR: What's it going to be like to play in that team competition again?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, we have so much fun.  This time going to be our third time to play UL International Crown.  This time I'm pretty -- I'm going to say I'm pretty cocky with my team now.  I really proud of my team.  I think they doing well.   
THE MODERATOR: Same for you?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I'm very happy with my team as well, especially have amazing team.  Just what she say, I think.   
Yeah, like to have my sister on the team and like to play team events you have to get along really good with your teammate.  I think we get along really good.  We got a good team and we really support each other.   
THE MODERATOR: Could we perhaps see the two of you playing with each other in competition?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: How about we keep it as a secret.   
THE MODERATOR: I like that strategy.   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Is that good?   
THE MODERATOR: Yes.  I'll ask you each one more question.  Ariya, you have a chance to win the Rolex ANNIKA Major Award this year.  What would that be like for you?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I mean, I pretty close like two years ago.  I feel like actually it's pretty cool when you saw the award, you saw the history, like how many people won the award.  This is a great role model.   
I'm not going to expect to win the award, but I'm going to try to do my best.  Yeah, just do my best and have fun.   
THE MODERATOR: And Mo, you achieved your goal of winning your first tournament this year in Los Angeles.  What are your goals now that you've won, and do you feel differently when you play in tournaments because you have won?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, my goal is of course I want to win a tournament, but just want to, you know, like work on what I have to do and just keep it in a good process.  Yeah.   
THE MODERATOR: Good luck with that.  Thank you both for joining us, and best of luck this week.
