 Q.   Mark, you went out on the golf course, assessed it.   Just tell us what you saw out there.   
MARK RUSSELL:   The golf course is no problem.   I mean Tom DeGrandi and his staff did a great job, and this place drains great.   It was bone dry to begin with.   So it handled the rain.   
We really didn't get that much rain.   Bunkers held up great.   We could play golf if it wasn't for the lightning situation.   The lightning detector ‑‑ detection system we have, our meteorologist ‑‑ will not go down, and it just reached a point where it didn't look like it was going to get any better.   
We got a good forecast tomorrow.   We're going to be in position at 7:00 tomorrow morning and we're going to finish the second round.   We're going to make the cut.   We're going to play two tees and we'll finish the third round.   Should get back on schedule, no problem, Sunday morning.  
   
 Q.   Mark, any damage on the course, trees hit, anything like that?  
MARK RUSSELL:   No, I didn't see anything at all.   A little rain.   But it soaked it up.   This place drains great.   It's no gravel pit.   
   
 Q.   So it's threesomes at 7:00?  
MARK RUSSELL:   No.   We're going to just resume play at 7:00.  
   
 Q.   And then the third round I assume ‑‑  
MARK RUSSELL:   And then the third round we'll play off two tees in threes.   That's right.   We've got a good forecast tomorrow, so we'll be in business.
