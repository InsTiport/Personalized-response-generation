 Q.  Billy Horschel on number, what was it, 9?  
MARK RUSSELL: No. 9 green.  John Lillbis had the ruling, he's here with me.  And what happened, he moved some bicycle fencing that was connected.   
Now, on our hard card, it says that that is a temporary immovable obstruction that you can't move and he moved it and it was on his line, so he got a general penalty, two strokes for breaking that local rule.   
 Q.  So was he informed of that at the time?  
JOHN LILLBIS: Yes, yes.   
 Q.  So he was told that?  
JOHN LILLBIS: See what happened is, we suspended play, his ball was there and he even asked if he could take relief right now and we did.  And coming back, I had walked up and he had already moved the fence out of the way.  So I sat there and I go, where did the fence go?  And he says, well, I moved it.   
And he thought -- first of all he thought it was immovable which it's not on our local rules card and he also was thinking during the suspension that he could do it, which he can't.  So once he moved it, he's going to be penalized.   
 Q.  So it was when they went back out, after the suspension, he moved it to play that shot and then he --  
JOHN LILLBIS: Then I came up for the ruling and he was going to take under 24-2, under an immovable obstruction, which is cart path.  And I basically asked, where did the fence go?  And he said, I moved it.  Because he thought he could, but you can't.   
 Q.  So as soon as he moved it, even though he didn't play the shot, it's a penalty and he had to put it back.  
JOHN LILLBIS: Well, no, two-shot penalty.   
MARK RUSSELL: It was on his line, so.   
 Q.  Okay.  So before he played the shot, the fence went back into place?  
JOHN LILLBIS: No, he played it right where it was.
