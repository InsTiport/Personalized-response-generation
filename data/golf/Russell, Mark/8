Q.   I'm here with PGA tournament director, Mark Russell.   Mark, you've got a busy morning.   How much rain did they get overnight here at Colonial?
    MARK RUSSELL:   Inch and a half on top of that probably eight inches they've had in the last few weeks.   Totally saturated.   I mean, we're fortunate to even be able to play today.   I can't say enough about Scott Ebers and his staff at the golf course here at Colonial.   They just did a great job for us.   We had a three-hour delay.   We're playing -- we can't take much more rainfall, but we'll see what happens.

Q.   What type of forecast is for the rest of today?   I know there might be some showers around noontime?
    MARK RUSSELL:   Yeah, there's some showers possibly.   We can handle some light showers.   A heavy downpour is going to put us out of business.

Q.   And that would probably take us maybe into Monday?
    MARK RUSSELL:   Well, I don't know about that.   But we've got a little time.   Sunset is at 8:30 tonight, so we could play a little bit after that.   But we're doing all we can to get it in today, but if we have to play tomorrow, that's what we'll do.

Q.   And it's not going to be that big of a deal because the guys aren't going to have to drive that far to Dallas.
    MARK RUSSELL:   That's right, we don't have far to go.   But the regulations stipulate that we play 72 holes.   We're going to do everything we can do to do that and hopefully we'll get it in today.
