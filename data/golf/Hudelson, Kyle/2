KYLE HUDELSON: I would like to thank the staff. The superintendents had the course just perfect.
Adam, you're the man. Only time I ever got mad at Clark is when he talked about a read. Yeah, I'm so glad my mom and dad are here, Oklahoma in the house.
Yeah, we appreciate everything. We've had a great run, and can't wait to play in this championship again.
