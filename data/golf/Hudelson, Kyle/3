KYLE HUDELSON: We just knew the day was going to be mentally tough.  It's an all-day sucker.  It's a grind.  Playing against Nate Smith.   
CLARK COLLIER: Yeah, those guys are Legends.   
KYLE HUDELSON: Nate Smith, it's just an honor to play with him.  I mean, how many matches has he played in?   
 Q.  Well, he's played four.  He's won five USGA Championships and another USGA --  
CLARK COLLIER: What a class act.  They're truly a great example for the game.   
KYLE HUDELSON: Yeah, they were fun to play with, fun to battle with.   
 Q.  Did you feel, when you play against a team like that, the pressure's off you guys, probably.  Do you feel comfortable?  
KYLE HUDELSON: We said that going in.   
CLARK COLLIER: The pressure wasn't off.   
 Q.  But I mean, they're the favorites.  
KYLE HUDELSON: We said we had already won, and they had nothing to lose against us.  I mean, everything was against us.  Being a great team and us being a dark horse, you know, it was great.   
CLARK COLLIER: We've been playing on house money this whole tournament, so...   
 Q.  You get here, you're one of the last teams in, and you could be the last team in it.  
CLARK COLLIER: I guess that's all.   
KYLE HUDELSON: That would be great.  We'll see tomorrow.  We'll gear up and do it again tomorrow.   
 Q.  I mean, this morning you looked out here going 18 and you escape and get a 19 hole win, and then you go a full 18 again?  
KYLE HUDELSON: It was awesome.  Just for our morning round, we battled all day, and then this match we battled all day and it is so exhausting.   
CLARK COLLIER: It's exhausting.  It's a marathon.   
KYLE HUDELSON: You get a ten-minute sandwich break, and you're going again.   
CLARK COLLIER: It's a marathon.   
KYLE HUDELSON: It's exhausting.   
 Q.  Was there a key point in this match, I know you guys went up early?  
KYLE HUDELSON: We wanted to get off to an early start and just kind of try to stay on top, because we knew if we kept letting them hang around, they're good enough.   
CLARK COLLIER: It felt like it was a slow start for both us.  Like there was no real pizazz to the match.  There were just a lot of pars.  We got to 2-up, and it was like, these guys, once the adrenaline starts pumping, these guys are going to get better.  We can't let up on them.  So we just tried to stay.   
Then Kyle made a great birdie on, what was that, 13?   
KYLE HUDELSON: I couldn't even tell you the hole.   
 Q.  I think it was 13.  How far was it?  
KYLE HUDELSON: I don't know.  Oh, 13.  The uphill par-4.  Yeah, yeah, that was probably a ten-footer downhill.  Clark, didn't you make par the next?  Or no?   
CLARK COLLIER: No, that was the one where I hit driver and you made fun of me.   
KYLE HUDELSON: Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was a fun hole.   
 Q.  You lost 15, right, to bogey?  
CLARK COLLIER: We lost 15.   
KYLE HUDELSON: That hurt us.   
CLARK COLLIER: That was the big missed three-footer there.   
KYLE HUDELSON: That was big.   
CLARK COLLIER: That was hard on me too, but I think we both did a good job of putting it behind us and going to the next tee and just forgetting about it because we had to.  So we were able to execute some good shots coming down 16 and 17.   
 Q.  You hit some great shots, especially the one out of the junk.  
KYLE HUDELSON: You should have seen it.  It was an unbelievable shot.  That freed me up on the fairways.   
CLARK COLLIER: I could have topped that ball just as easily.   
KYLE HUDELSON: After I saw that, I hit mine because I knew he was up here.  I wouldn't have hit that shot if I would have known.  I mean, I probably would have been aiming more towards the back center, but, yeah.   
 Q.  You're going to have a heavyweight tomorrow in the semis either Christovich and Rank or Harvey and Mitchell?  
KYLE HUDELSON: Great.   
CLARK COLLIER: Yeah, sounds like a dream.   
KYLE HUDELSON: Yeah, sounds awesome.   
CLARK COLLIER: We've been an underdog the whole time.   
KYLE HUDELSON: Yeah, it's nothing new to us.   
CLARK COLLIER: I guess we've got another tee time tomorrow.   
KYLE HUDELSON: That's all we want to do.
