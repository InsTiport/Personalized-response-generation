HYE-JIN CHOI: I trailed behind.  We both made mistakes earlier, but we also put some good shots together, too, but she came on top and made the last two birdies.
Q. Is this a case more of Andrea winning rather than you losing?  Do you know what I mean by that question?
HYE-JIN CHOI: I think we both made some mistakes here and there, so I can't really say if she won because I made mistakes or if she was good.
Q. Going this far in this event as your first USGA amateur championship, what are your impressions the way you played getting to the semifinals?
HYE-JIN CHOI: I'm fairly satisfied with my results.  It was my first championship in the United States, and I haven't played a lot of match plays before, so I think it was a good experience.  With the results, I'm pretty much satisfied with it.
Q. Considering that the two events that you played in this year for the USGA, one where you were at the low amateur at the U.S. Open and the second you were a semifinalist at the Girls' Junior, you've got to be pleased with that.  That's great play in two events.
HYE-JIN CHOI: Yeah, with the U.S. Open, I mean, my goal wasn't really to win, obviously.  But I did receive a low amateur, so I was happy.
For this, my goal was to win, but for me being in the semifinal, I think that's good results for me.
