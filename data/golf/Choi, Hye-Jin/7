Q. So congratulations.  It was a very good round yesterday and today.  You finished with three birdies in a row.  That had to be a good feeling.  Tell me about your round today?
HYE-JIN CHOI: Today was definitely a long day for me.  I didn't really have the conditions coming into the competition today.  The last two birdies, I think I was more relaxed.  So I was able to get three birdies in a row.  Not good conditions, but, hey, relaxing made it work.
Q. You've enjoyed your time here so far?  You're having fun?
HYE-JIN CHOI: Yes, with a little hesitation.
Q. What have you been doing?  You've had a very busy summer; what have you been doing to help keep yourself calm?
HYE-JIN CHOI: I mean, I can't really say I have a lot of relaxation during the summertime.  I had the competition and the championship.  But I was able to find some time.  Like during the practice round, the official practice I was able to pull back some energy I had before.  The conditions I was able to measure it correctly so I didn't overdo it in the actual championship.  But today was not a very good day.
Q. Not a very good day, but right now you're still tied for third.  Going into match play, do you change the way you play your game?
HYE-JIN CHOI: Stroke play and match play (Indiscernible), I have to be more focused, especially in the first holes.  So I'm going to try to focus as much as possible and make less mistakes as possible.
Q. Semifinals of the Girls Junior, a great showing.  What do you take from your week at the Girls Junior that you can apply to match play here?
HYE-JIN CHOI: I made so many mistakes during that semifinals, and I actually think I could have won if I didn't make those mistakes.  So this time I'm definitely going to reduce.  Thinking about the mistakes I made there and try to reduce them as much as possible.
