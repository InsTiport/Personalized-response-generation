Q. Pretty steady today; how do you think you played?
HYE-JIN CHOI: I actually don't think it was steady.  I think my opponent made a lot of mistakes, which I was able to win.
Q. You won the Canadian last week; did you get a lot of momentum through that, and are you using that to propel you through this week?
HYE-JIN CHOI: I'm actually pretty much drained, but some of the players who played the Canadian also are playing here, so I'm going to use that as motivation to keep my energy up and my confidence up.
Q. You're playing this, and then you played the Canadian last week, and before that you played the Girls' Junior.  Are you just exhausted right now?
HYE-JIN CHOI: To be honest I was very exhausted the first official practice round here, but now I'm still not fully adjusted.  My condition is not fully adjusted, but I'm managing it.
Q. There's still a long way left in this championship.  Do you think you'll be all right for the rest of the way?
HYE-JIN CHOI: I'm definitely going to keep it up because I did lose in the U.S. Junior Girls in the semifinals, and I'm going to use it as motivation to go forward.
Q. What's after this week?  Are you planning on resting?  Do you have another championship scheduled?
HYE-JIN CHOI: There is actually a championship a bit close after this week, but at least one day I'm going to rest as much as possible.
