Q. First off, how do you feel?
HYE-JIN CHOI: Well, difficult to say how I feel exactly but initially I didn't have the greatest of starts so I wasn't exactly sure but I think later on I was getting better feel at how my play is going to go so I think that definitely helped and probably finish it that way.
Q. How much of the help was it playing along side Amy for the day?
HYE-JIN CHOI: Well, she is definitely experienced player.  So, playing next to her definitely helps me to be more, I guess, inspired by her play and try to push myself to be good as her.
Q. How tough will it be to put it together another day like today tomorrow?
HYE-JIN CHOI: I didn't have the greatest start but I think if I just stay focused and play the game as maybe not necessarily play safe but maybe more aggressively, kind of like how I did, I think I'm going to be okay tomorrow.
