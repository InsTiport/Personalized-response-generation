 Q.  Only two strokes off the lead.  How difficult will the weekend be?  
HYE-JIN CHOI: When I was first traveling over here, my goal was to make the cut.  And if I made the cut, I was just looking for the top-10.  So I'm already very happy with what I'm doing and I'm not going to feel any pressure.  Just here to have fun.   
 Q.  You've had success in USGA championships.  You were low amateur last year at the Women's Open.  You were very successful at the Junior and successful at the Amateur.  Does that help you with your confidence playing in the U.S. Women's Open this year?  
HYE-JIN CHOI: Last year's experience gave me a lot more confidence than my first event and the results were pretty good, so I feel a lot better this year.   
 Q.  Very good score after two rounds.  Do you feel confident you can shoot lower scores?  
HYE-JIN CHOI: For sure.
