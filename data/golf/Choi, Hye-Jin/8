Q. You've played a bunch of matches now already in a couple days. How are you feeling right now? Are you tired, exhausted, excited? 
HYE‑JIN CHOI: I was definitely a little bit tired today. My drives weren't that great in the beginning, but I did finish great. 

Q. You said your drives weren't great in the beginning, but you were still winning a couple holes. How were you able to get off to that fast start? 
HYE‑JIN CHOI: Although my drives were not ideal, I did have great saves, plus when I made mistakes, my opponents also made mistake, so I took a chance. Also when I had a chance at birdie, I took the opportunity to step up and focus and make birdie to win the hole. 

Q. You had a big lead early on, a couple‑hole lead, and then towards the middle of the round she won a couple holes. Were you getting too comfortable, too relaxed, or what was happening there? 
HYE‑JIN CHOI: I mean, I was more disappointed at my own mistakes, that I wasn't really thinking about my opponents giving me pressure through those holes when she was winning.

Q. You're in the semifinals, so what is it going to take to win the whole thing now? 
HYE‑JIN CHOI: Because it's the semifinals, these are the four girls, including myself, are the best in this tournament, so definitely I'm going to practice right now so that I can avoid any mistakes and go over the mistakes that I made today at certain holes.

Q. You lost a few holes but rebounded with three birdies and four straight holes won. How?
HYE‑JIN CHOI: In the last three holes, my putts were great. I gained confidence as I went through one by one.
