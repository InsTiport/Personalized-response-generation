 Q.   Well, you didn't hit a whole lot of fairways.   So what was the key to your round?   
SCOTT GARDINER:   I think I hit a few early, probably a few makeable birdies in the first seven holes, so six in a row was a nice way to start.   I missed like an eight‑footer on the first, but I can't complain.  
   
 Q.   No, absolutely not, not with a 6‑under par start.   Not exactly the way you want to finish, but the two reachable par‑5s coming in, what happened there?   
SCOTT GARDINER:   Yeah, well, actually, didn't hit that bad a drive on 16, and went left and got stuck behind a tree and had to lay up.   And then I hit a pretty good (Indiscernible), I missed a four‑foot putt.   That was a struggle, but the rest of the shots I was fairly happy with.   But then a couple of the tee shots there on the last, I'm just going to work on it this afternoon and try to get a bit more comfortable.
