Q.   I got to see you play a little bit the last three days.   I'm really impressed with your game.   A lot of ball control for you.   You hit 16 greens in this third round. 
SCOTT GARDINER:   Yeah, I was just trying to think about shots in front of me.   I grew up by the coast, so the wind is something I'm familiar with.   Having not really hit a lot of balls, it's been about trying to control it.   I haven't had to try and make the perfect swing as we try to do when we get too much time on our hands.

Q.   You're originally from Australia.   Talk about paying your dues.   You're 36 years old, you made 199 starts on the Web.com TOUR before securing your PGA TOUR playing privileges. 
SCOTT GARDINER:   Yeah, well, I was always learning, so hopefully I'm still going that way and getting better. 

Q.   Looks to me like you've been learning bunker shots.   You're 6 of 7 out of greenside bunkers this week, two pretty salty saves on 17 and 18 today. 
SCOTT GARDINER:   Yeah, pretty pleased with them.   But come tomorrow I'll have to try to stay out of them.   But playing on the Gold Coast, that probably helps.

Q.   Talk about your mindset going into the final round. 
SCOTT GARDINER:   Just enjoy it, hit the shots I've been hitting, keep doing what I've been doing.   That's been working, so I've had a lot of rounds behind me, so it should hold me in good stead .

Q.   The rough being a little lower than it usually is, does that help you be more aggressive?
SCOTT GARDINER:   Possibly.   I mean, the fairways are firmer so more balls are getting in there.   So it sort of goes both ways.   But I think with the fairways rolling, if you can be aggressive you can get shorter shots in.   That's why scoring is pretty good this week.

Q.   And lack of wind is helping, too, yes?
SCOTT GARDINER:   Yes.   Today I think it laid down a little bit.   It's been warmer, too, so the ball is going a little further than what it might normally go.   Definitely from the start of the week. 

Q.   So if the ball doesn't land on the fairway you're going to have a rough go of it, though, right?
SCOTT GARDINER:   Yeah, if you take the aggressive club, that's the case.   But yeah, if you want to make birdies, you've got to be in the fairways. 

Q.   Playing first round or first week on the Web.com and playing the first week on the PGA TOUR, how different is it for you? 
SCOTT GARDINER:   Well, when I played the Web.com I had already played a few seasons in Europe, so I‑‑ it was a great place to be.   To come to America, I was pretty naÃ¯ve, I didn't know what I was getting myself in for.   But it's Hawai'i.   It doesn't get any better. 

Q.   Expectation wise coming into the week, did you have any expectations?
SCOTT GARDINER:   No, none at all.   I just‑‑ I only hit balls once in the two weeks before the tournament because we had snow at Christmas and a couple days after.   My family‑‑ my wife and kids aren't here because I figured I wouldn't be much company at the start of the week because trying to get myself somewhat competitive.   But my mom and dad are here, but yeah, just happy with how it's going.   I've had some help from Matt Jones' coach Gary Barter and been watching some of your shows trying to get some tips.
