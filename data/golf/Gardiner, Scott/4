  Q.  How good was that?   
 SCOTT GARDINER:  It was pretty good. It's a challenging course and to get off to a start like that is very good. I wasted a few but obviously made a few birdies.   
  
  Q.  What didn't you waste?   
 SCOTT GARDINER:  I hit a lot of good putts. I rolled it good on these greens. That was the key. I grew up on Bermuda greens and I can see the grains pretty comfortably. That helps.   
  
  Q.  You had the accuracy you needed to stay away from the rough?   
 SCOTT GARDINER:  I found the rough a few times but I managed to recover well or found the nicer parts of it.   
  
  Q.  Was the heat a problem for you?   
 SCOTT GARDINER:  No, playing in America on the Nationwide Tour, we play in the middle of the country and we get temperatures of mid-30s Celsius quite often. It makes it a bit easier to deal with. It wasn't too bad today and hopefully it will stay like that for the rest of the week.   
  
  Q.  Have you been playing well of late?   
 SCOTT GARDINER:  I haven't played a lot. I just got told that my clubface was a bit shut at address and I was losing a lot of shots left. Squaring it up and making it a bit open kind of tidied it up. It is an improvement. I was aware of it myself and had someone to have a look and it was probably more exaggerated that what I had thought. I've had to keep an eye on it last year and I think I've got to keep an eye on it this year. It is something that we often neglect, look at our feet, shoulders, see where the club is going to and stuff like that.   
 The Johnnie Walker is one of my favourite events. I have a pretty good record in it and you have a great field in here. If it doesn't get you motivated, then you're in trouble.
