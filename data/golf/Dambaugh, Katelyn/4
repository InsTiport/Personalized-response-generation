Q. So yesterday was a little more steady; today was kind of up-and-down?
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Up-and-down, yeah.
Q. How did you think you played today?
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Well, the score ended up okay.  I had a rough start again, bogeyed my first hole which was 10, then I got a couple birdies on that side, then picked up one on my back nine which was the front.  But kind of ran out of energy.  I didn't really eat as much as I should have, and so I kind of went downhill for about three or four holes and then ate a little sandwich, got a Gatorade and it started picking back up.  But I wasn't making as many putts as I was yesterday.  But I don't know.  I finished pretty well, considering how I felt.
Q. Yeah, you said your putting could have been better.  What was your best part of your game so far or today?
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Still probably -- I've been hitting a lot of greens, knock on wood.  But I think that's been a big thing.  I've been really like being consistent with hitting greens.  My putting wasn't bad today.  I just like made everything yesterday.  But, yeah, probably my short putts, my five-footers have probably been saving me.
Q. Thoughts going into tomorrow?
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: No, just I'll play exactly how I've been playing.  I won't play any differently than I do in stroke play unless obviously something crazy happens.  I'm just excited to get back out and see what happens.
