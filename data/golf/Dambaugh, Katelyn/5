Q. You started with a double bogey.
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Yeah, I was kind of like in la-la land, yeah.
Q. But a heck of a comeback, four birdies over the last six holes.
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: I guess, yeah.  I think.  I have no idea.
Q. Tell me about your round.  You say la-la land, clearly you started out a little quiet.
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Yeah, I just wasn't really focused, and I kind of was like, okay, you need to start playing now.  It took me a while.  I just stayed patient.  I don't think I got a birdie until 7.  Yeah, so I just stayed really patient, and my coach from school was on the bag, and we work really well together.  She works with me a lot during the season.  We just tend to make a lot of birdies when we're together.  Somehow, I don't know.  But I was hitting it pretty well, and I made a lot of good putts today.
Q. Any of those putts that really stood out to you as a good key moment for you?
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: I think the one on 7 because it was probably about 20 feet or so.  Yeah, probably about 20, 25 feet on 7 for my birdie, and that was good.  Had momentum, and then I made about a six-foot par save on 8, so I think that kind of set it good for me.
Q. You're coming in with a pretty hot hand.  You've had a great 2016 so far.
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: I have.
Q. How is your game feeling right now?
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: It's pretty good.  I just got a new set of clubs, a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, that's a -- I really like them a lot, and I've just tried to just keep doing what I've been doing this whole year and just having fun and staying patient.
