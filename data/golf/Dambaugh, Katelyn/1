 Q.  Great first round for you.  Seven birdies, anybody will take that.  But it was a nice way to bounce back, because you had a bit of a rocky start there.  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Yeah, I mean, I got a little too greedy on my first hole hitting it in the water.  But bounced back nice, and I've been striking the ball really well.  Last week was the best ball striking I've had.  I just haven't been able to make putts and they decided to drop today.   
 Q.  How's the course looking out there?  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: It's in great shape.  I love it.  The fairways are awesome and the greens are rolling really well.  Like last week, it's one of my favorite places.   
 Q.  I know it's early in the week, but how comfortable are you being at the top of the leaderboard and being the one that's being chased right now?  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: I don't really pay attention to it that much.  I'm just playing my game.  I'm comfortable with my ball striking right now and I have a lot of confidence with that.  So as long as I keep my putter going, I'll be happy with the results.   
 Q.  This the lowest round you've shot on tour.  I guess what was your feeling coming down the final few holes?  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: I've been really close all year.  I've either been putting really well or ball striking it really well.  Both of those just came together for once today, and I just hope it keeps going.
