 Q.  Basic thoughts?  How did you think you played today?  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: I played pretty well.  I started off really good.  I had a couple like mistakes starting on 7.  Couple mistakes, and then bounced back pretty well on the back nine after 11.   
 Q.  How are you feeling fatigue-wise?  Do you feel all right right now?  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Yeah, I'm fine.   
 Q.  You finished a couple holes early.  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  How important is getting done quickly with all the matches this week?  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: It always makes it a lot easier to get done quicker.  Just gives you more time to rest and save energy.   
 Q.  What was working the best today?  
PERSON: What was working today?   
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Yeah.  I have no idea.   
PERSON: Your start was really good.   
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Yeah, my start got me.   
PERSON: Her start was very, very steady; hit a lot of greens; kept the pressure on.  That was good.   
And then at the end she kind of came back.  She had a couple hiccups, but for the most part was really steady.  She only hit a couple bad shots.  I would say the beginning she was just in a really good rhythm.   
 Q.  Anything in particular that you're looking to improve on tomorrow?  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Probably short game a little bit.   
PERSON: She hot a couple chips, she missed a couple chips and one pitch on the Par 5, but for the most part, you know...   
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Wasn't bad.  I hit a couple good shots ended up bad luck.   
PERSON: Everything was very solid ans very good.  Been putting really well.  Speed has been good.  Staying patient out there and not getting overly aggressive on some of those hole locations.   
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Yep.  Exactly.   
 Q.  Works for me.  
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Thank you.
