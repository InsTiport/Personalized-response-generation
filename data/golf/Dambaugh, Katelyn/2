Q. Another steady performance; tell me how you thought you played today.
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: I thought I played really well.  Again, same as yesterday, I had a couple holes where I actually had a few really tough breaks at the end of the front nine with hitting good shots and just got bad breaks with that.  But I didn't let it get to me, and I just kept playing the same that I've been doing.
Q. Kristen, who you just beat, was a champion of this in 2014, so that's got to give you some confidence going forward.
KATELYN DAMBAUGH: Yeah, I mean, I actually played in the finals with her at the North-South a couple weeks ago against her, so I knew her game.  I knew how she played.  So I didn't really worry coming out here.
