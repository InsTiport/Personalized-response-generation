Q. Big highlight to finish.
MI HYANG LEE: Yes.
Q. Take me through what you had in there on 18 and the thought process.
MI HYANG LEE: It was 145 front and 152 to the pin and it was left-to-right helping wind, and so me and my caddie just decided between 7 faded or 8 punch, 8 low shot.
Then I asked to him about front of the green if a little firm then I think just we can bounce it up to the green, because I don't want to be like way long of the hole. Then he says, yes, then just try to hit low.
Was really pretty good shot. I saw just the ball roll into the hole. Yeah, was really great finish for me and really have a confident for tomorrow.
Q. A good round tomorrow can put you right back in it.
MI HYANG LEE: Yes. So right now is really surprise that you guys interview like 3-over par player. But, still, yeah, thank for that. Hopefully be better tomorrow.
