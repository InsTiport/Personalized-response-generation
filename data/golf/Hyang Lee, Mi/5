Q. A 68.  How would you assess that?  What are your thoughts?
MI HYANG LEE: First of all, it was a good start.  First of all, made the birdie.  Then I think the front nine, my shot wasn't very good but just I had a really good up-and-down.  Then I started bogey from the back nine, but still, I tried to focused on and keep trying to keep fighting.
Turning point, make birdie, hole No. 14 and 15 and 16.  So it was a good finish and really look forward to play tomorrow.
Q. The weather's supposed to change again tomorrow.  It's supposed to be pretty horrible, to be honest.  You know what it takes to win in horrible conditions.  You'll probably be about four shots off the lead.  You're still very much in this competition, aren't you?
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, I think so, because when I won 2017, it wasn't good weather, also.  And then it was like six strokes behind at that time.  Yeah, I really have confidence right now, so yeah, just have to play tomorrow.
