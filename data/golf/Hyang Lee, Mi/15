 Q.  The way to win it with a 66, what are your emotions right now?  
MI HYANG LEE: I didn't believe I got a win today.  So it was a really surprise for me, and then just my front nine is amazing, and then I think I got a good start from my first hole.   
Then just my back nine is a little up-and-down, but I made a lot of putts.  I made a lot of good putts and then a good chip shot, too.  Just I think hole-by-hole, simple.  Just try to think of the simple, yeah.   
 Q.  Your play this weekend was quite incredible after the first two days where you struggled to get under par and this weekend you just accelerated away.  What was the difference?  
MI HYANG LEE: Actually my bag doesn't come this week until Wednesday.  First time I practice with my golf club on Wednesday.  Just I rented clubs from the pro shop for the practice round on Tuesday.  So yeah, it was a really good experience for me.   
I think the first and second round was, I hit it really good, but just I missed a lot of putts.  So I tried to practice my putting with the wind.  I made a lot of putts yesterday, so I took a lot of confidence from yesterday.   
 Q.  When you came in, I know that you didn't even realise what position you were in; someone told you that Karrie Webb had double-bogeyed.  When you were standing on 18, were there any nerves?  
MI HYANG LEE: No, not really, because for sure, just she was the lead and then she was 7-under.  So I thought she's going to win.  So just I want to make the eagle but it was a really good putt.  I just happened to make a 2-putt, that's it.  I didn't have any nerves for that.   
 Q.  Obviously it's a great preparation for the British Open coming up.  You've won in the Home of Golf already.  Hopefully, I know you must be full of confidence to go and make it another one.  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, it was really good practice for the British this week.  Then just I take a lot of confidence from this win, so hopefully I can win next week, too.
