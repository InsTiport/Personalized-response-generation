Q. 8-under par, tell me about your round out there today?
MI HYANG LEE: So I start eagle, hole No. 12.  It was a really good second shot and good putt, also.  Then so I think like a good start and good finish, also.  I made a par at No. 8 and 9, really happy.  Then missed only one green today, so I think my shot was really good.  Some of my long putt, a little too long for me, so I could make still a little hard for par putt, but still was really good round and really happy for my results.
Q. You have very happy memories of this tournament, don't you, and of playing in Scotland.  Why do you think you play well here?
MI HYANG LEE: Because actually I live in the island in Korea, so always windy over there.  So always like practice with the lower shot.  Really love to play Scotland and British Open, also.  Then I think that is like a lot of help for in Scotland golf, I think, too much windy here.  Yes, so I think that is a help.
Q. Although today it's been a beautiful day and important to have a good score when conditions are like this, because tomorrow, everything changes?
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, so when I see the forecast, today is like best day and then tomorrow is worst day.  So my plan, my kind of plan was I try to make a lot of birdies as I can, and then I think I did, so I'm really happy to do it.  Then I think tomorrow, hopefully we can play, but just I really look forward to play tomorrow and this weekend.
