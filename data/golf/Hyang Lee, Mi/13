 Q.  Speaking of last week, was that motivation for you heading into this week?  
MI HYANG LEE: I did like maybe six weeks in a row the cut and then three weeks break, but another cut missed last week, by one stroke.  I did play good last week, but I think just I tried to think the bad luck and still just my coach said I just getting too positive, so I tried to think positive, and then I think this week was I tried to make pretty much a lot of long putts, distance control.  So practice a lot about the putt.  And then it was really good today.  So that's why I think I make a lot of long putt also.  So that's maybe just a little different than last week.   
 Q.  What else did you do well today?  
MI HYANG LEE: I hit drivers good.  I only just hit the fairway bunker one time on hole number 17.  So that's pretty good positive.  And actually my putt is all week awesome.  So maybe just my putting is best today.   
 Q.  And you said that's the thing you worked on most between last week and this week?  
MI HYANG LEE: Last week and this week, yeah, because my long putt distance was awful.  So my caddie was a little angry to me about the distance control.  That's not professional.  So I tried to practice a lot this week, but long putt and it was work.   
 Q.  What do you like about this golf course?  
MI HYANG LEE: Oh, you know, I saw the Instagram like 167 bunkers in here.  Feels like 200.  And then if I hit it solid, I still have chance to go into the bunker.  So have I to play more smart and not the driver every hole.  So that means like more maybe direction.  So yeah, but I think the greens are a little softer today.  And then not as fast.  So I think greens are a little easier than last week.
