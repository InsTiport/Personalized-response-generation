MI HYANG LEE: First of all, I'm really honored to play with -- because I love baseball, but I heard they are legends on the Boston Red Sox maybe, so it was really an honor to play with them.   
Yeah, I work on my -- changed a little bit with my swing with my coach.  It wasn't good at the practice round.  My ball was going all the way -- I mean, most of the time it's going to miss the right, but it was a little better yesterday and keep it better today also.  So I had a little birdie chance, but I didn't make any later birdies, only the four birdies.  So I have to work on my putting a little bit.  Yeah, I just want to keep it going.
