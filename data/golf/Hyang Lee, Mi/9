 Q.  Nice job today.  Oh, my gosh.  Talk to us about your round.  
MI HYANG LEE: I mean, (indiscernible ) on the back nine because was good start 1st and 2nd hole.  Then, I mean, I think I did not bad.  I mean, I didn't make the bogey back nine, so that is way better than second and third round.   
So that was my goal, I would just come down and keep my plan the back nine then.  But just only one shot is like maybe No. 18 tee shot.  I think that's is my -- only one shot bad like today.   
 Q.  You were disappointed in your tee shot?  
MI HYANG LEE: Just a little bit, yeah.   
 Q.  You steadily climbed the leaderboard.  Were you watching at all?  
MI HYANG LEE: No.  Even I didn't know until last hole.  I asked my caddie, Do I need to make birdie or eagle, and he said just, Oh, just focus on your golf.   
Then after I make par he said, Just you have to make eagle just have a chance.  So, yep.   
 Q.  Are you happy with the finish?  
MI HYANG LEE: Oh, yeah, of course.  Am I second?  Third?   
 Q.  You're second.  
MI HYANG LEE: Second.  Even I didn't know that.  This is my best finish in major, so should be better after.  We have like four more majors.  Yeah, this is a really good momentum for me, so, yeah, I'm so happy with this week.   
 Q.  What does this do for your confidence going forward?  
MI HYANG LEE: I mean, it's a lot of camera and people cheering and watching me that back nine, but still I can control by myself.  I think my mental is more better than before.  That is more confident, yeah.
