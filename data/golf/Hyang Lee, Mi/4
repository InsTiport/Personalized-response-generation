 Q.  Just one bogey in the final round.  How did it go out there today?  
MI HYANG LEE: So it was a good start the front nine, 4-under par.  So I had a lot of confidence, but like the wind at the start, I made a bogey on 10.  I started on the back nine.  So it was hard to focus on with the rain, so just like trying to keep the focus on my golf today but it was hard.   
But I think I had a lot of good par saves on the back nine, also.  So I'm really happy to shoot 3-under par in the final round.  I really look forward to playing next year here.   
 Q.  What is it about Scotland that you like so much?  You seem to play well.  
MI HYANG LEE: People so nice.  I love U.K.  I mean, I grew up in Korea, so always playing with the wind on an island.  The golf course, it's pretty much not hundred percent links golf course but it's like 50 percent links.  So really happy, really comfortable playing in here.  Then I think I can trust my golf.   
 Q.  What's your plan for the off-week?  It's been a long stretch.  
MI HYANG LEE: I find my sleep problem, and I'm back to Dallas.  I'm back to Dallas and I'm going to see my coach, Cameron, to try to fix the swing a little bit.  First thing, I think I have to rest.  But probably going to the hospital for even just a good rest.  You know, just get there Monday night and have to leave to Canada on Sunday morning or the afternoon.  It's my whole week.   
 Q.  Just for a cold, you're battling this week?  
MI HYANG LEE: Yes, really good and really excited to play here, but since I had a cold.
