 Q.  You may be a little disappointed with your finish, but can you sum up your week and a top-15 position right now at the Canadian Open?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I played great all week, just had a couple bad breaks.   
 Q.  When you had your back injury a couple years ago, was there ever a time when you thought it might have been serious enough where you would have had to stop playing golf?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, for sure it was scary.  It was an injury I never had before.  I didn't know what it took to heal.  I'm definitely happy to be back and healthy.   
 Q.  Was there anything that you did specifically to get over that?  Was there surgery?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: No, just time off.   
 Q.  Just rest?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah.   
 Q.  Could you just break down your round for us today?  You were playing strong and 4-under up until the last hole.  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, as I said, I hit the ball really good today.  Putting was good, too, just the ball didn't drop and just had a couple bad breaks.   
 Q.  On 17, your second shot, were you just unlucky on that?  It sucked back down.  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, I don't even know how it was physically possible to spin it back there, but yeah.   
 Q.  What does it mean to you, though, to be playing the way you were on the last day of this tournament?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I'm sorry?   
 Q.  What does it mean to you to be playing so strong on the last day of this tournament, and I think because it's in Canada, there's always extra attention on the Canadians, always a little bit of extra pressure.  What does it mean to you to play that well and be among the leaders on the last day?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: It means a lot to play good in front of everybody.  I mean, we have a lot of supporters this week, so it's nice to see everybody come out and support us.   
But yeah, I played good, but obviously there's some improvement I need to make.   
 Q.  Do you take any satisfaction that you're going to cut a pretty decent check here this week?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, absolutely.   
 Q.  To get into that top 80 on the Money List is very important --  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, absolutely.  I know the purse is very big here compared to other tournaments, so it was very important to play well here.  My goal was top 10, but I think I might be just short of that.   
 Q.  Pretty close, though.  Not bad.  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Pretty close.   
 Q.  You'll be going to Cambridge this week?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yes.   
 Q.  How does playing well one tournament in Canada set you up for next week?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: It's good preparation.  Obviously it's going to be a very different course, but the greens are going to be firm and fast like here.  It's good preparation.   
 Q.  Do you see this as a breakthrough result for you, or does it feel like it right now?  Do you know what I mean by breakthrough?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: No, it doesn't feel like a breakthrough.   
 Q.  Why not?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I don't know, I just feel like I can play a lot better than this.
