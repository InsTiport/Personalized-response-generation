  Q. How do you feel about making the cut, a little nervous?   
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, I was very nervous today, just trying not to think about the cut, but obviously I was thinking about it because I was hearing it in the crowd a little bit and seeing it on the boards.   
 But it's just a great feeling. It's a great accomplishment for me.
