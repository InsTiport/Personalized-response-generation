   MAUDE AIMEE LEBLANC: I was really nervous on the first two holes. After that I just had my normal game. It was really impressive to watch Michelle hit. She's a great player. It was fun.   
  
  Q. What were you most impressed with, the club head speed, flight of the ball? What was it that kind of caught your eye?   
 MAUDE AIMEE LEBLANC: Her swing. I really liked her swing. She made a couple of mistakes, but she's a really good player. She should be in the lead right now, but I don't know what happened. She's very good.   
  
  Q. The way she started there, were you thinking it might be something special here? Did it have that feeling?  
 MAUDE AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah. I was just very lucky to play with her.   
  
  Q. The four-putt on 6, was that a little bit of nerves maybe?   
 MAUDE AIMEE LEBLANC: Just I didn't have confidence with my putter today. I had a lot of birdie opportunities, but if I can work on my putting a little bit, it should be better.
