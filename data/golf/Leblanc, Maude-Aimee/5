Q. Birdie on the first but the front nine was a little slow, I guess just take us through that front nine?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I hit some good shots on the front, lipped out a few holes, but I stayed patient and knew I couldn't miss them all and they would start falling at some point.  Got some momentum back on No. 1, and that gave me confidence with the putter for the rest of the round.
Q. How many times have you played here?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I played I think 2012, 2013.
Q. So this is the third time?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah.
Q. Does familiarity help at all at this course, do you think?  People say the greens are tricky with the poa annua; does that help, do you think?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, absolutely.  It always helps to know the course or to play it.  I don't think you can be too prepared.  Yeah, absolutely, and I love the links style.  The less trees I see, the better.  That's good.
Q. A couple of W ds; what's been going on recently?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Just little misadventures but physically everything is good.
Q. Travel?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, travel.
Q. I also saw some missed cuts.  Anything that's been holding you back in certain places, things you've been working on?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Not really.  I'm just trying to get out of my own way.  I've been hitting the ball really well all year long.  I just mentally didn't trust myself, so that's all I've been working on.
Q. Mental, clearing the head?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I'm a mental case but I think I'm getting there.
Q. Do you work with a coach right now?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yes.  I've been with her for ten years.
Q. She's based back home?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yes.
Q. What's her name?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Denise Lavigne.
Q. What was expectations coming into this week?  What are your goals week-to-week?  What are you setting out?  Are there mini-goals, big picture goals, anything in particular?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: For now just try to trust what I do.  Yeah, it's been a slow year so far, so obviously I want to make some cuts and get up on the money list and trying to get in as many tournaments as I can for the rest of the year.
Q. Do you think that helps motivate you where you're coming back against the wall in that type of situation?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, I think I handled the pressure pretty well when it comes to that.  Yeah, I think it helps.
Q. Tomorrow, getting off to good starts, do you think it's more so important than a four-day event?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Sure, absolutely, because you have less holes to catch the leaders.  So yeah, I've been struggling with my starts, so it's nice to finally have a good start, keep the momentum going.
