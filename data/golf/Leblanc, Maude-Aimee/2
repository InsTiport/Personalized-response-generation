 Q.  How did it feel out there today?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I feel like I played a lot better than my score.  I didn't make any putts.   
 Q.  So you're somewhat frustrated then with the way it went?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, for sure.   
 Q.  And on No. 9, your last hole there, what happened on that putt?  I mean it just lipped out, unfortunately.  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah.  That's the story of my day.   
 Q.  I know you're frustrated, but you've definitely made the cut for tomorrow.  How does that feel?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Feels good.  Obviously, like I said, I feel like my score should be better, but it is what it is.   
 Q.  Is there anything you need to work on?  Are you going to do that later today or wait till tomorrow?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: No, not really.  I feel like my stroke was good.  The speed was a little off, so I'll probably go practice that.   
 Q.  On greens you're saying; right?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah.   
 Q.  Were you enjoying yourself out there today at all?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah.  I mean I put a lot of pressure on myself today.  I don't know why, more than usual.  I was more nervous than usual.  But yeah, I'm glad I got the job done for this weekend.   
 Q.  You're not sure why the nerves were there?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Maybe -- well, because it's kind of our last tournament of the year in North America, I guess, and I have friends and family that are coming tonight to watch me this weekend, so I was like, don't screw up.   
 Q.  How important is it to do well in Canada for you?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: It's very important.  I mean that's probably why I felt the nerves more this week than any other week really.   
 Q.  Now that you know that you'll be playing tomorrow.  Are you going to call some of those friends and family that are coming to visit?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah.  I can say you can start driving now.   
 Q.  Are they coming from Sherbrooke then?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yes.   
 Q.  That's a long drive.  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: It is a long drive, so I didn't want them to come here and bring nothing.   
 Q.  As a Canadian, do you get a lift from the play of Alena and Brooke this year?  Does that help you mentally?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, absolutely.   
 Q.  How so?  
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I mean I've played with Brooke before and Alena.  And I they're really good players, and I wanted to go to the Olympics this year, but Alena had an amazing year, probably the best year of her career so far.  But I tried to give it a run, but it wasn't enough.  But it definitely helped me to play better.
