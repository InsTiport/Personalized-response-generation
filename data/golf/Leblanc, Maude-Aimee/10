 Q. So round one done. How did you feel out there? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Pretty good. I started a little slow, made a bogey on the first five holes. But after that, after I made a birdie on my ninth hole, which was the 18, that was a really good break. 
 I got relief from these camera towers, so I could play from -- I could have a shot again. That was a good break, and I made birdie on the first hole, so that was a really good push. I don't know, but it helped. Then after that I just kept my rhythm and stayed confident.

 Q. How is the weather? Did it impact the game too much or was it all right? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: It wasn't too bad. It rained a little bit this morning, but I prefer that it rain a little then the wind blows. It was pretty good.

 Q. How were your nerves going into this? With you being Canadian and from Quebec, did you feel a little pressure going on? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Oh, for sure. The first few holes you always feel the pressure. But at the same time, it's all family and stuff that follows me, so it's people I know. It keeps me calm a little more.
