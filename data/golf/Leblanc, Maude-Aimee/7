 Q. Was there one point in the round where you felt it slipping away and you knew it was going to be tough to recover? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: No, I think it was just like a progressive thing.

 Q. One of those situations where you're fighting and you justify can't get it back? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, pretty much.

 Q. What do you take from this? Four days, you played well. What do you take from this in terms of experience-wise? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: As I said in French, just having a good start. 
 If I shot 80 the first day I wouldn't make the cut, so, yeah. That's the thing to take, I guess.

 Q. You're obviously very upset. Do you take the fact away that you were able to play with these ladies through the weekend and proven that you belong here? Is that at least some consolation? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, for sure. I played good golf the last two rounds, so, yeah.

 Q. How about the weather? Just curious what it's like out there? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: It's probably one of the worst conditions I've played in.

 Q. It started off real well, a birdie and those consecutive bogeys kind of threw you off, I guess? 
 MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, the wind gusts were kicking in (Indiscernible).
