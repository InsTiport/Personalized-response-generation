Q. So you chipped in.
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Putted in, yeah.
Q. So it was a bit of a tester of a shot.  How were you able to make that one?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, I know the greens are super fast, so I just know I had to roll it on the green, and then the green was going to do the rest.  But fortunately I did the job and it's a good way to finish.
Q. What did you think when it went in?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Finally, a putt that drops.
Q. Yeah, because you've had a few close ones?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, I think the longest putt I made before that was three, four feet all day.  Yesterday the same thing.  So it's nice to finally see something going in.
Q. Yeah, Alena was at 7-under and Brooke at 5-under, is it nice to have a Canadian contingent in the Top 10?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Yeah, absolutely.  But it's something that you expect to see from Brooke and Alena.  They're really good players.  But it's good to see they're doing good this week.
Q. And to be among that group, that's a feather in your cap, I guess?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: Oh, yeah, it's very nice.  I mean, I played here in 2009, so I knew the course a little bit.  I didn't have a good experience back then, so I got a little redemption this year.
Q. Yeah, what do you have to do to keep it rolling on the weekend?
MAUDE-AIMEE LEBLANC: I'm hitting it great.  So I'll just keep that going and just trying to make a few more putts.  I mean, these greens make the US Open look like nothing, so...
They're super fast, super firm, and it's all about putting out here.
