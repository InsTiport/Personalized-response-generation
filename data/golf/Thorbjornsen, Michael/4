 Q.  Did you hole out on your eagle?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Yeah.  On No. 2 I hit driver, it went really far for some reason, I think like I caught a dry patch just on the left side.   
And then I had 181, it was kind of in between clubs.  I then chose to take the longer one and the funny thing is right after I hit it, I kind of caught it a little thin, but I still had a divot and everything.  I dropped my club, didn't even look at where the ball went, I knew it was going to go over the bunker, but just not what direction.  And then I picked up my club, looked at the line of my divot, started walking a little bit and then everyone started yelling, saying it went in.  So it was a big surprise.   
 Q.  You didn't see it roll in?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: I did not, no.   
 Q.  You just heard the noise.  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Yes.   
 Q.  So that's exciting.  Talk about the rest of your round, how did you feel out there?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: So, basically I played pretty solid, just all around.  I was kind of struggling those last four or five holes just with my tee shots.  On the front nine I couldn't miss with my driver and then on the back it was, I was having trouble just making contact, it was going way left, way right, high slices and stuff.  But I managed to scramble pretty well.   
And then another small thing is, putts inside six feet, they can look straight but they can snap just out of nowhere.  And I had probably four putts that were missed inside of five feet today and it's kind of frustrating, but at the same time if I can manage to sort that out, then I could go pretty low, I guess.
