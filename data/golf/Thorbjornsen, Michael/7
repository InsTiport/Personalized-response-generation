 Q.  All right.  Sitting here talking to Michael Thorbjornsen who finished today with a 76 and is also second youngest amateur to make the field on the weekend since World War II.  Tell me about your experience this week.  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Ah.  I can't really put into words what it's been like this whole week, just playing in the PGA event, then a major, then it being the U.S. Open, which everyone wants to play in, everyone wants to win this one the most.  And it's the most difficult course and challenge that players face throughout the whole year.   
And just knowing that I'm playing in it, get to put my game up against the best players in the world, I mean, that means a lot.  And having played the way I did, those first two days put me in position for the weekend, felt amazing just knowing I could play two more rounds on this beautiful golf course and just show that I belong here.   
 Q.  And you obviously feel like you can do that.  You can play at a U.S. Open level and you're on 17 years old.  What do you have in the future for this year, and where do you see yourself evolving as a player going forward?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: So definitely after this week I can see where the pros are at.  I mean, yes, I made the cut, but I am, like, not even close to being in contention.  So I have a lot to learn.  I know what I need to improve on.  And I think that's probably the biggest thing this week because now that I know what I need, I can use this experience for me to play better amateur golf and then eventually get on Tour and then see how that puts me out there.   
 Q.  So that's the long-term goal.  Have you looked at colleges yet?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Yes.  I committed last November.   
 Q.  To?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: To Stanford.   
 Q.  Oh, to Stanford.  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Yes.   
 Q.  So you maybe get to play here a little bit.  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Yes.   
 Q.  A few times.  Not too far away.  That's great.  Well, congratulations.  Good luck the rest of the summer, and hopefully we'll see you back here.  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Thank you.  Appreciate it.
