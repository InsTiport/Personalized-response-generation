 Q.  You had a great round.  Talk about that a little bit.  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Yeah, I mean, I think I won four or five holes in a row.  Started with my opponent 3-putting.  It was unfortunate that he had a very tough putt.   
Then the next three holes I think I just had full wedges in, and I think full wedge is one of my favorite shots.  I hit those three within five feet all three times and they were basically gimmes.   
Slowly but surely I just kept knocking wedges closer and closer.  It was just I think might have been hard for my opponent to keep up with that.   
 Q.  Then when you're up by that many, do you find it hard to kind of close out the match, or do you kind of just play aggressive still?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Yeah, I definitely still try and play aggressive.  If I do play aggressive and things don't go too well, it's just one hole lost.   
Yeah, again, I just stick to my game plan that I set at the beginning of the week.   
 Q.  And do you have lots of match play experience you can draw on in situations?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: I've only played a couple matches like in a tournament up north in Massachusetts, but I play a lot of match play rounds with my friends at IMG Academy.   
This is my first actual big tournament that has to do with match play.   
 Q.  What is your mindset going into the next round of 16?  
MICHAEL THORBJORNSEN: Just continue everything that I did this morning.  Hit the same clubs off the tee.  I liked every single approach that I had.   
And then I can also draw off like where to miss the ball or where I want to leave my second shot and have good chance at birdie.
