 Q.  Tell us, what were your expectations coming into the Sime Darby Malaysia?  Did you expect to see your name somewhere on the leaderboard?  
XI YU LIN: Well, this is my second year playing this tournament, and last year I was sick first two rounds so I didn't play very well.   
Last year I finished pretty good, so I know I can play well on this course.  I'm happy.   
 Q.  So much red on your scorecard but for a little blemish at the 18th.  
XI YU LIN: Well, on 18 I pull my drive, but it was lucky the ball stay next to the (indiscernible), but it's still a not very good lie.  I had a really good second shot on the green.   
I guess I was a little too aggressive trying to make another birdie.  So I putted (indiscernible) past and just (indiscernible).   
 Q.  Still a sensational round.  I know you're good friends with Shanshan Feng who won this event last year.  Did the two of you get together to talk about the course?  Did she offer you any advice on how to play it?  
XI YU LIN: Well, I watch her on TV when she play back nine last year.  So we didn't really talk about it, but I think I learn lots about how to play this golf course.
