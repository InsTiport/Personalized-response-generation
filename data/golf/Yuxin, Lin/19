 Q.   We're here with Xi Yu Lin.   Great round today.   You head to the clubhouse right now in second place in this tournament.   How was the course playing today?  
XI YU LIN:   I think today I start early, so at first I'm a little bit cold.   So first I start from 10; I didn't make birdie there.   
But I think my putting is great today.   I made lots of the putts from five yards, eight yards, which is pretty tough.  
My iron is pretty good and my driver, like so‑so.   Just very satisfied with my putting.  
   
 Q.   You said your driver was so‑so.   What are you not liking about it at this point?   
XI YU LIN:   It goes left, right, right.   Because the fairway is pretty wide here and some of the holes, I need to get the right kick but I just missed by like five or ten yards left or right.  
It's still fine, but I can make myself some more opportunity, I think.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel like the greens are rolling today?  
XI YU LIN:   The greens are pretty good.   I mean, because I hear that at the start of the year, they have the big trouble of the greens.   I think the course is in good condition and the grass is fine.   It's not very bumpy.   I think it's just me, because I am putting a lot.  
   
 Q.   Is there a potential for this course to shoot a lot of low scores?  
XI YU LIN:   Yeah, I think so.  
   
 Q.   You shot a very low score.   How comfortable are you going into the final three days?  
XI YU LIN:   Well, because this is my first year on LPGA, and this is the lowest round I play.   I like this course and I like today's putting, it's really make me feel comfortable.   So I just keep going and hopefully have a good finish.  
   
 Q.   And you're excited for tomorrow now because of such a low score?   
XI YU LIN:   I excited for every day.
