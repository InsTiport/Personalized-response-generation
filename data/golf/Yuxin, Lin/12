 Q.  Were you playing a different golf course to everybody else today?  
XI YU LIN: I think today is pretty good round for me.  Actually when I played in the practice round, I thought, this place is pretty tough, and also I'm pretty surprised what I'm doing today.  So I'm really satisfied with my game and my game today.   
 Q.  You were quite brilliant and you seemed to be very relaxed playing with the best in the game alongside Inbee Park and Jessica Korda.  You're enjoying it out there?  
XI YU LIN: Yes, this is my first time playing with Jessica, and I've played with Inbee a couple times before.  Well, they are all really good players, and, well, I'm just feeling really good that I can play with them.  And they are all really nice and makes me more relaxed I think.   
 Q.  Can you tell us about the wonderful shot you hit into 17?  
XI YU LIN: 17, because that pin position today is -- well, it's pretty easy for that green.  So I was just looking, I should get it close on this hole and try to make a birdie.  I actually hit it a little thin but when the wind is helping, so I wasn't really looking at the ball and they told me I almost hit in.  Yeah, I was pretty surprised.   
 Q.  You had a couple of tap-in putts.  And lovely that your mom is out here cheering you on.  
XI YU LIN: Yeah, my mom just got here this morning and she hasn't watched me play since the U.S. Open.  So yeah, she's going to stay with me the next couple days.  I'm very happy that my family can be with me this week.
