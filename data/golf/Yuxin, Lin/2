Q. So the threeâhour wait this morning in your first Masters, do you think it affected you in any way? 
YUXIN LIN: Yes, I feel like it probably affected almost every player out here, everyone waiting for three hours. I just feel like maybe I just didn't get off to a good start that I wanted. I felt like I lost a couple strokes here and there, and then it was just not a good round today.

Q. Can you tell us a little bit about your eagle on 15 and how that helped your round today. 
YUXIN LIN: Well, I hit two really good solid shots. Hit a good drive off the tee, and I was actually kind of in between clubs. Then really I pitched it perfectly and it landed right next to the green. 

Q. Last question. What did you learn today from the course that you can apply for the rest of the week? And what would you like to improve? 
YUXIN LIN: Well, I learned a lot. I felt like I can make improvements on every aspect of my name. I felt like I lost a few strokes every here and there. I just felt like there's lots of room for improvement, and I just hope that I can be better tomorrow.
