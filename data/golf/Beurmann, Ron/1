 Q.   Talk about starting off the day here in your native state.   What that means to you to have the honor?  
RON BEURMANN:   It was great.   I thought about that first tee ball and I didn't know I was going to be the absolute first tee ball off the first tee today.   
But I hit it right down the middle and that made it for me right there.   
I finished bad, otherwise I hung in there today.   I just needed to par a few holes coming in and I would have felt very good about it.   
It was fun.   I had two great guys to play with.   They took care of me out there and treated me great.   So it was a lot of fun.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the last three holes of the day.   
RON BEURMANN:   The last three of the day I started thinking about it, I was out of my comfort zone.   That's as easy as you can say it.   Things just got a little dicey.  
   
 Q.   Was it the weather, the course?  
RON BEURMANN:   No, just nerves.
