   DOUG LABELLE:  You know, I played pretty solid.  I didn't drive it as well as I'd like, but my putter for three days has really saved me.  I haven't missed a whole lot of putts inside ten feet, so that's been my key.   
  
  Q.  And yet a bogey on a par-5?  Can you forgive yourself for that one?   
 DOUG LABELLE:  No, I was lucky to make bogey.  I made about a 12-footer for bogey there.  I hit four bad shots and had a penalty stroke.   
  
  Q.  Playing well for three straight rounds.  Were you ready for a cold, soggy, Michigan kind of day?   
 DOUG LABELLE:  Well, today was supposed to be okay, but it's tomorrow that doesn't look very good.  So whatever it is, it is, and I'll put myself in a good position.   
  
  Q.  You're playing pretty well.  Good finish at Sony and you're playing well here.  What's really clicking for you?   
 DOUG LABELLE:  Well, my short game.  That's really been key.  I got a lot up-and-down there at the Sony, and my tee-to-green game was a little off, and here my driver is just a little off, but my short game is really coming through for me.   
  
  Q.  You hit 14 greens, only 28 putts.  You're playing well.  Good luck tomorrow.   
 DOUG LABELLE:  Thanks.  Appreciate it.   
  
  Q.  You're going to be in one of the last three groups, and you might be chasing as many as eight strokes.  Is there a strategy for that, or do you just go out and try to play your game?   
 DOUG LABELLE:  Well, on a golf course like this, it's a tough golf course for me.  I don't hit it that far.  I just kind of go one shot at a time and plug along, and whatever it is, it is.  It appears we're playing for second, but you never know.
