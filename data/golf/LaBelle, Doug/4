 Q.   7‑under par through two rounds.   Just get your comments on the week so far.   
DOUG LABELLE:   I can't chip it and putt it any better, so that's been what's keeping me afloat.   I'm hitting it all over the place, but I'm able to get it in the hole.  
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about this tournament and getting in.   This is two years in a row that you've Mondayed, Monday qualified.   Did you do it any of those other two starts?  
DOUG LABELLE:   Yeah, '08.  
   
 Q.   So three of the four?  
DOUG LABELLE:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Any secret to that success?  
DOUG LABELLE:   I couldn't tell you.   Maybe it's the time off and Christmastime, taking ten days off, two weeks off and then practice for a couple of weeks and then just come on over.   I'm not sure what the deal is, but three out of four Monday qualifiers here, and both times in '07 and '08 I finished in the top 10.   There's something about this place for me.  
   
 Q.   You're in great shape going into the weekend.   Just comment on the position you're in and your expectations.   
DOUG LABELLE:   Well, I mean, my expectation is to‑‑ I need to do the best I can with whatever each hole presents for me.   I'd obviously love to win the golf tournament.   That's what I'm trying to do.   I know there's a lot of good players in front of me, behind me, so it'll be a tough couple of days, but if I can just get the ball in the fairway, I like my chances.
