Q. 66 around Carnoustie is a great start - you must be happy?
A. I am pleased with that. I have always liked Carnoustie so it was nice to get off to another good start. I drove the ball well and putted exceptionally. 

Q. Carnoustie is generally agreed to be the toughest of the three courses this week, so it's good to hear someone say they absolutely love it?
A. I really like it. I don't think I have ever shot over par around here in this tournament and I think I have always started here.

Q. It has been a good year for you with two wins, so what do you hope to achieve with what's left of the season?
A. I have no set targets. I'm really just going to see how it goes. If I play like that again I know I have a chance of being up there come Sunday. I played Kingsbarns yesterday and played lovely. I had seven birdies and an eagle. I'd certainly take that tomorrow, but I am guessing the weather is not going to be great going into the weekend so it's nice to get this one out of the way.
