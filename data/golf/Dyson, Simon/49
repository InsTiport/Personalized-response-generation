Q.  Tell us about the hole in one.
SIMON DYSON:  Yeah, I mean, it was just perfect yardage really.  I had 185 to the flag and wind was just off the right and just knew it was a solid 6.  Hit it lovely, it was always going to be close, but yeah, it was nice to see it drop.
Q.  Only the third man today to break 70.  How good a score is that?
SIMON DYSON:  Yeah, I mean, I played fantastic to be honest.  I made two bogeys and didn't really hit a bad shot for my two bogeys.  Found two poor lies just off the green.  Didn't hit very good chips on both of them.  But gave myself a lot of chances again.  I putted a lot better today.  I putted terrible yesterday.  I hit the ball equally as good.  Yeah, anything in the 60S today is a fantastic score.  It's not nice today.
Q.  Yesterday you were 1 under with a couple to play and finished 6 6.  What were you thinking on the 17th tee today?
SIMON DYSON:  Yeah, it was a poor finish yesterday, because I only had about a 3 footer to go 2 under yesterday and managed to 3 putt.  Hit a really, really good drive down 17, only had 200 yards to the flag, so sent one out there.  Kind of bailed out a little bit to the right.  There was a bit more room, hit 4 iron just down the ride, managed to get it just off the green and left myself a pretty easy 2 putt.

I hit a good drive down 18.  Just went too far and had to try and cut it around the tree, clipped the tree, dropped down and made 5 in the end.  Yeah, like you say, striking the ball really good.  My driver is going long and straight, so makes the course a lot easier when you're doing that.
