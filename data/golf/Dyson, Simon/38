 Q. It was a great week for you last week and you've carried on this week. 
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, great week last week. Helps when you started this week, it helps when you're playing well. He was my partner last week, and we helped each other along to be fair. He shot 3-under, as well, played nice, and I shot 4-under, played nice. 
 So keep it going. 

 Q. You must be sick of the sight of each other after last week?
 SIMON DYSON: He's a good lad, I don't see that much of him. No, he's a good lad. Enjoying it, helping each other along nicely.

 Q. The conditions here were comparatively for this place relatively calm?
 SIMON DYSON: That's as easy as you're going to get this place, without a doubt. The fairways are running, the greens are holding and there's hardly any wind. 
 If there was ever a time to shoot like mid, low 60s, that was it I suppose.

 Q. Your confidence must be sky-high at the moment the way you're playing. 
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, confidence has always been pretty high. Especially now the way I'm playing. I'm hitting the ball good. I drove the ball nice today. I holed some good putts, which my iron play is solid, as well. I'm giving myself plenty of chances.

 Q. And optimistic for the rest of the week?
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, well, just see what happens. You don't know what the weather is going to be like, if the weather is going to turn a bit nasty, and then it's a question of just plodding around and trying to hole a few putts. 

 Q. A different challenge than last week. 
 SIMON DYSON: Totally different.

 Q. Do you like this sort of golf?
 SIMON DYSON: I do. I wish we played more of it to be honest. I wish we played a bit more of it but unfortunately we don't.
