  Q. How are you?   
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, I felt fine all the way around to be fair but the last few holes I was struggling a bit. My energy levels were low, so I was trying to eat and trying to keep them up.   
  
  Q. On the subject of eating, what did you eat, how bad was it?   
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, I had some -- must have been bad chicken and I felt horrendous yesterday morning, absolutely horrendous. Didn't leave my bed all day yesterday, and I managed to get a slice of toast down last night, and, well, I was in bed all day yesterday, all last night. Then woke up this morning, ached a bit, but didn't feel too bad.   
 But yeah, if I get a decent meal down tonight and a good night's sleep, hopefully I'll be full fit tomorrow.   
  
  Q. It wasn't ideal preparation, was that the reason why Ollie started so well in your group?   
 SIMON DYSON: I think so. I think so. He did start very well. It was one of those, I needed him to, because it took me a little bit to get into it.   
 But that's why we work so well together, he knew it had hurt me a bit and so he started it and I came into the middle and finish it off, so perfect partnership.
