  Fourth Round 65. Total 259 (-21)

 Q. Thoughts and feelings? 
 SIMON DYSON: Disappointed. I played lovely today. I just didn't hole a thing on the back nine, didn't hole a thing. 8 kind of stopped me in my tracks. You know, I got off to such a great start that the bogey on 8 just stopped me on my tracks a bit. 
 I had a good chance at 9. I had a good chance on every hole the back nine. Didn't miss a green and they just didn't want to drop and that last one summed it up, absolutely summed it up. It can't miss three-foot out, downhill, downgrain and it stops two inches short and it was just like -- anyway. 
 Still, a great week. Played lovely, and it's good to take into the last tournament of the year. 

 Q. How good a week is this? 
 SIMON DYSON: It's brilliant. Really enjoyable. Really enjoyable. 

 Q. Some of the best atmospheres on Tour. 
 SIMON DYSON: This, and I think the Emirates in Dubai, I think that's amazing as well, atmosphere, and it's great to be a part of something like that.

 Q. What do you take out of next week, playing well? 
 SIMON DYSON: I'm playing lovely, driving it nice. My iron play is good. My putting is really good. I'm threatening everything I hit. Even my bad putts are hitting the hole. It's all good. Looking forward to it. 
 I played with Rory the last two days, pleasure to play with; played with JD the first two days, pleasure to play with. It's just brilliant. I like playing with really good players and it spurs you on, massively. 

 Q. Poults has done well. 
 SIMON DYSON: Brilliant. Brilliant. Disappointment of Sunday last week, to come back and winning by two at the minute, so he only has to bogey the last. And he's won it. So fair play to him, he deserved it. He played brilliant the past two days. I could have taken him a bit close if my putter had been hot the back nine, but it wasn't, so never mind.
