 Q. You seem very pleased - did you play well? 
 
SIMON DYSON: I played very well, but I've got to say that I changed my golf ball recently to the new Callaway Black and it was just unbelievable.


Q. What was the main difference in it?

SIMON DYSON: Playing through the wind was a lot easier. It just seemed to cut right through it and it was a tremendous help out there today because it got quite strong at points. Put it this way, I hit a two iron into the par five third and I don't think I would have even thought about doing that if it wasn't for the ball.


Q. It's obviously given you confidence - but it's not just the ball that made you play well, is it?

SIMON DYSON:  No, I played some lovely stuff out there today, in fact, I can't really remember hitting a bad shot to be honest with you and my putting got better and better as the round went on.


Q. Do you enjoy the format here?

SIMON DYSON:  I do. I think you've got to come here this week and enjoy and we were having a great laugh. I played the first two dunhill events and did alright in them so I look forward to this week.


Q. Has it been something of a frustrating season for you?

SIMON DYSON:   It has - I broke my hand back in April and was out for six weeks which obviously affected me. I missed out on some big, big tournaments as well as a result of that. The two that spring to mind are Wentworth and the Deutsche Bank which left me a bit gutted but I've just got to get on with it. A good finish here would help me a lot.
