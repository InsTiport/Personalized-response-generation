 Q. Tough out there, well done. 
 SIMON DYSON:  I played lovely.  I played all right last week.  Doha just does not suit me at all.  Been hitting the ball good just not holing the putts.  Today I saw the lines so much better, struck the putts good and managed to hole a few.  Still pleased it was nice to finish with a birdie on 9 there.  It's a tough hole. 

 Q.  So this course suits you more than last week? 
 SIMON DYSON:  So much more.  Something about that t that I really like, really like.  I like the place, I like it as a whole.  I like everything about it.  So you're always good in spirits when you come and play here. 

 Q.  Those two wins last year, what did that do for you, for your confidence and your targets coming onto this year? 
 SIMON DYSON:  Yeah, it did a lot for my confidence.  I think a lot better on the course now as well, which before, I would get nervous even after shooting this now, but now I'm thinking, well, just keep playing how it is.  Just keep playing how I'm playing.  Confidence is high. 

 Q.  Nice looking leaderboard, nice to have your name amongst them? 
 SIMON DYSON:  Yeah, absolutely.  Not much bigger than Ernie, is it.  I like playing early on a Thursday, always, because whenever you turn up in the afternoon, you see all the scores, immediately you start thinking:  I'm going to have to shoot a good score today.  I do a lot better what I do that, so give me some early tee times. 

 Q.  Anything unusual out there? 
 SIMON DYSON:  There's some good pins.  There's some Sunday pins out there really.  The course is set up immaculate.  The greens are fantastic today and the whole course is perfect.  So I can see why someone like Ernie is 6-under and probably get to 7.  I'm just pleased with where I'm at really.
