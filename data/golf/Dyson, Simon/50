SIMON DYSON:  Played lovely, just two dropped shots on the back nine but didn't feel I hit a bad shot. Managed to grab a birdie on the last and nine under feels a lot better than eight. It has been a difficult say with the weather. The wind was changing every ten minutes. I am pleased with that. I haven't hit any bad shots. Even my bogeys were not bad shots.
Q.  You are having a great season?
SIMON DYSON:  Just a different player. I have dedicated myself more and practising on the right things and it is paying off. I know what I need to do now which is good.
Q.  Looking forward to a big weekend?
SIMON DYSON:  Absolutely. I have St Andrews both days and if we have the worst of the weather tomorrow I would rather be there to be honest. Also if the weather is good you have chances of birdies. I love playing St Andrews. There is something about Carnoustie and here I like but St Andrews is St Andrews.
Q.  And playing with Sir Michael Bonallack?
SIMON DYSON:  I will be asking him where to hit it. He's a very nice guy.
Q.  Best hole?
SIMON DYSON:  Birdie on 18 was the best birdie of the year. Right into the wind and hit driver four iron and managed to slot it in. Play it now and it is driver nine iron, but it was tough when we played it.
