Q.   What does this high finish represent for you this time? 
SIMON DYSON:   I like the place.   I like coming and playing here.   I finished tied third on my own a couple years ago.   Two years ago I had to withdraw and actually last year I played really nice but missed the cut by a shot, don't know how. 
I really like coming and playing here.   I think the changes they have made to the course make you have to really control your ball, and I was able to do that this week, so I was, yeah, really pleased.

Q.   Great seeing you back competing again, obviously you had a few problems at the tail end of last year.   Wonder what that has done for your appreciation and love of the game?
SIMON DYSON:   Yeah, certainly gave me it back, without a doubt.   I felt like I was just kind of cruising along, and like you said, I started to play really nice toward the back of the year, and then obviously certain things happened and I wasn't able to play. 
But I could play the ones in South Africa, got off to a good start, finished third down in Leopard Creek, and then when I was able to play, that just made me want to crack on, really. 
I haven't been playing that good the last month, six weeks, been swinging it not very good.   So put a lot of work in.   Went to see my old coach, Steve Robinson, back in York and hit a bit with him and saw my coach, Pete Cowen, and did a lot of work with him the last few weeks and seems like it paid off a little bit, so I'm pleased.
