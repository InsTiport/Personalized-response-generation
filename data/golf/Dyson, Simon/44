   SIMON DYSON:  It was a shame to lose this morning. We didn't deserve to lost by that score. We played fantastic but they got the breaks on 18. Felt we needed some justice in the afternoon and we came out firing and birdied the first, the third and the fifth. I holed a 20 footer at the first and third and six feet at the fifth. One point in it now so it's very interesting tomorrow. Should be a good day.
