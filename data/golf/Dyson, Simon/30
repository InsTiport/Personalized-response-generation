   SIMON DYSON: Level was the worst I could have shot by few today. I played equally as well as yesterday, but seven, eight, nine I hit some lovely shots in and the wind just took them and I walked off with three bogeys. Three putted 11 from nowhere and hit a lovely shot into 12 and the wind didn't touch it. So five bogeys out from five pretty good shots. But I kept my head and finished well. Had a chance on 15 as well but managed to birdie 14, 16 and hit a lovely shot into 17 to three foot and it was nice to hole that on the last.  
  
  Q. On to the Czech Open and looking interesting for The Ryder Cup?  
 SIMON DYSON: Absolutely. That is the best I have struck the ball for four straight days ever. I didn't miss a drive all week, my three woods were good, my irons were good. The only think I would say is that I am very slight and I get blown about in the wind so I struggle to putt in strong winds like that today. But I managed to hole a few today and good week.   
 I can't wait for the next two weeks. If I hole a few putts I will be contending in both of them. It's very exciting and I am looking forward to them both.
