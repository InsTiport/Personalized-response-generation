 Q. How were you feeling? 
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, he got three back in the next four, and yeah, I mean, it was coming back quite strong. You know, I made a couple of birdies in those. So, yeah, I mean it was -- was thinking he might chuck another few birdies at me but apparently he's still got to do it, because I wasn't making many bogeys out there, which is quite easy to do. But yeah, he threw a lot at me, and then just at the end I managed to hang on.

 Q. Seeing how much you enjoyed the Seve Trophy, Vivendi Trophy as it is now, this tournament, your first occasion here, how much are you enjoying this one?
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, it's great. You stood on the range and you're looking down the range and there's another 15 world-class players. It's nice to be amongst them. But no, I'm just trying to enjoy it, really. I knew I needed to win this first match to stand any chance of going through, so it's nice to get it under my belt. 

 Q. You're playing really well this year, confidence is high, do you feel like you belong in this sort of scenario? 
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, it's starting to feel a lot more like it should. I haven't been playing got last two months. Today wasn't quite as good as I've been playing, but you know, hopefully I'll get a little better as the week goes on. That's when you need it. 

 Q. 36 holes tomorrow. 
 SIMON DYSON: Yeah, it's into the to bad. I still feel pretty fresh after 18. So I think I'm pretty fit. We should be all right.
