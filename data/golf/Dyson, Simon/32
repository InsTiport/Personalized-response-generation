   SIMON DYSON: That's the best I have hit it all season. I worked on a little drill with Pete Cowen a couple of days ago and it has given me such a good feeling back. I am starting to get my little draw back with my driver, so all of a sudden I am hitting it 15, 20 yards further than I have been and I am just striking it well.   
 Lovely 4-iron into the last, and nice to hole it. Even if I hadn't holed it, I would have been pleased, as it was a tough hole.
