 Q.   Tell us how good that score is on the first knock around here.   
SIMON DYSON:   I was quite pleased to be honest.   That wind is really picking up and yeah, it's not easy, there's is some good pins out there and there's some chances, as well, but no, I'm pretty happy with that.  
   
 Q.   Not what we expected; Jamie Donaldson shot 62 around here last year.   
SIMON DYSON:   Yeah, there won't be any 62s today, I can guarantee you that.   I don't think there will be any 62s this week.   It's playing really long, the course.   It's running nowhere on the fairways and the greens are pretty firm but they are very true.   
We were first group out, so we got the best of them and they were really good.   But yeah, there won't be any 62s.  
   
 Q.   That's a lovely putt from you at the last, you seem to have the measure of the pace?   
SIMON DYSON:   Yeah, nice and true, and just have to get it rolling.   I've been putting really nice today.   I've been working quite hard the last couple of days on my putting, and putting was probably the best part of my game today.   So maybe need to go to the range.   
   
 Q.   Come what may, it sounds like it's going to be a good foundation for you, but can you give an indication of what scores might be possible out there?  
SIMON DYSON:   I think someone could shoot four, maybe at push, five.   I'd go for four would be leading today.   Yeah, 4‑under leading.   
   
 Q.   But it is good for you?   
SIMON DYSON:   Yeah, I'm very pleased with 2‑under.   Yeah, I've been playing all right.   Not really much been happening, so it's nice to get off to a decent start.
