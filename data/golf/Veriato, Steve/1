 Q. Just overall, obviously not the score, but the experience of your two days here. Do you have any comments about that?
 STEVE VERIATO: Well, I guess I just wish everything was done and complete and it would have been a lot nicer. But this is probably my last one. I played quite a few of these. I'm age 64, so it's time to play something else or some events at home. 
 But the facility is nice, I hope it gets better, I think the Solheim Cup or something is coming on here. I think they will have a lot of fun.
