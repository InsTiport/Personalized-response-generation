JOHN LILVIS: Actually, we saw part of it was on television.  It went like us wandering the TV.  One of the guys was out there.  We actually wanted to do a review of it and based on where it was it was loose and loose coming back and it did hit the bell going through, but we asked the player and he said he did not anchor it.
Q. And did you ask the other players, too?
JOHN LILVIS: Yeah.  They said no.
