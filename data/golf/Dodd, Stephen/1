 Q.  Thoughts on the day?  
STEPHEN DODD: It was good.  Pleased with it.  It was tough out there, especially the first seven or eight, ten holes, probably.   
 Q.  And to get five birdies in these conditions was quite impressive.  
STEPHEN DODD: I didn't realise I had five.  Yeah, it was just every birdie is a bonus out there.  I putted well, so that was a big help today.   
 Q.  And your second shot on 18, best shot of the day?  
STEPHEN DODD: Yeah, it was just a good number and I hit a good shot, fortunately.   
 Q.  In these conditions, you have to be patient, don't you?  
STEPHEN DODD: Yeah, you just have to keep your head down and battle on because we are all going to drop shots out there.  It's as simple as that.  It's just how many you drop, and short game is imperative out there on days like this.   
 Q.  It's a very tight leaderboard.  Do you feel about for tomorrow now?  
STEPHEN DODD: My form's not been good, so I don't know what will happen tomorrow.  I will wake up and see where I am and come out and do my best.   
 Q.  Do the tough weather conditions suit you?  
STEPHEN DODD: Probably drags everyone down to my level, so that could be a good thing.  We'll see.  I wouldn't be disappointed if the weather is not great tomorrow.  We'll see.
