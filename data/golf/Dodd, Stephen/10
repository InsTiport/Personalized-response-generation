   STEPHEN DODD:  A little disappointed to drop one on the last but delighted with the score overall. The weather is closing in now and the last few holes were not very pleasant. It could have been a lot worse this morning and I think it was the time to score. It is key to get off to a good first round - put yourself in a position and try to build on that. I do not why I do so well around here. Every week I try to play the best I can and today it has resulted in a decent score. I do not try to do anything different when I come to Ireland, it's just that the results have been better here. 

 Q. Did winning last year change your life in any way? 
 STEPHEN DODD:  Not really. I was quite disappointed with the way I played after winning and I haven't played well this year until today. 
Fingers crossed I can carry it on. The course is a lot softer. The ball is not running at all and it is paramount to hit the fairways with the rough being so wet and heavy. The greens are fantastic. 

 Q. You seem to cope better than many in these wet conditions. Why is that? 
 STEPHEN DODD:  I don't know. You have just got the grind something out. You know the scoring is not going to be great and it's a case of hitting fairways and greens. This is something I did today and my short game was good, which is something you need in tough conditions.
