STEPHEN DODD:  I played poorly, but it's nice to get a score playing like that.
Q.  When you say playing poorly, 69 doesn't sound --
STEPHEN DODD:  I just didn't hit very many good shots.  It became quite difficult.
Q.  You're only a couple of shots off with a chance tomorrow.
STEPHEN DODD:  Yeah, I'd like to play better than that.  We'll have to see what happens.
Q.  Some pretty big names up there, as well.
STEPHEN DODD:  Yeah, I'll have to play well to win.  Like you said, there's many big names up there.
Q.  But you've already won this season, does that give you a bit more confidence?
STEPHEN DODD:  Not really confidence, but, I mean, I've got to play better than what I did today.
Q.  What specifically was wrong today?
STEPHEN DODD:  I didn't have a very good feel and I didn't hit very many good iron shots.  It's difficult when you are not hitting fairways, and it's very difficult when you're not hitting it very good.
Q.  Something you can sort out on the range?
STEPHEN DODD:  I'll go and hit some balls now and hopefully sort something out.  Just try and get.
Q.  Just try and get that feeling for tomorrow?
STEPHEN DODD:  Yeah.
Q.  Good three days so far, keep it up.
STEPHEN DODD:  Thanks.
