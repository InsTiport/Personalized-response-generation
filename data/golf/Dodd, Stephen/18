RODDY WILLIAMS:  Thanks very much for coming in and joining us.  Fantastic finish to the round.  Talk us through those last four holes.  Stephen?

STEPHEN DODD:  Hit a decent drive down 15, and Bradley pitched it in to about five feet and holed that.

Then he hit a great    what did you hit?

BRADLEY DREDGE:  3 iron.

STEPHEN DODD:  3 iron to about three feet on 16, holed that.

Drove it on the fairway and then to the back of the green on 17 and 2 putted.

And then we hit two decent shots down the last to about 15 feet and Bradley holed that.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Fantastic way to finish.

BRADLEY DREDGE:  Easy, really.  (Laughing).
RODDY WILLIAMS:  What were your thoughts, just a few holes to play and obviously taking yourselves to the top of the leaderboard now?

BRADLEY DREDGE:  We knew we had a few chances coming in, the short par 415 and we have 17 and 18 downwind, but we knew we had a few chances and we just stayed patient and had a great finish.  We were rewarded for our patience.
Q.  When I spoke to you before the start you said you were going to be aggressive come what may, foursomes, four balls and you were just not going to stop; have you stopped at all?

STEPHEN DODD:  We couldn't be aggressive on the front nine because we were coming out of the rough all the time.  So we were just patient, really, for nine, ten, 11 holes or so.

Then patience paid off for us at the end, holed a few shots and made a few putts.
Q.  Was it a shock to see a 61 up there?

STEPHEN DODD:  It was.  Don't expect that in this format.

BRADLEY DREDGE:  I think the biggest shocker was Argentina only shooting 4 under yesterday.
Q.  Wales' success in this event in 1987, is that positive Welsh sporting lore?

BRADLEY DREDGE:  I think so.  In Bryn Meadow Golf Club where I grew up playing all my golf, the owner has a large photo of Ian Woosnam on the green after the win.  I saw a lot of it as you can imagine going into the golf club, staring at it all the time.  It's inspirational all the time.  Bryn Meadow is where I used to play.
Q.  Were you into golf at that point?

BRADLEY DREDGE:  Yeah, I was 14, yeah, I just started.

STEPHEN DODD:  I wasn't.  (Laughter).  Yeah, I was into golf then, just about.
Q.  You have no memories of the impact it had?

STEPHEN DODD:  Not really, it's such a long time ago.

BRADLEY DREDGE:  You were about 35, weren't you?

STEPHEN DODD:  Don't know.  I can't remember now.
Q.  You've played with Woosie some; did you talk to him about it?

BRADLEY DREDGE:  No, I didn't actually, no.  I should remind him about it and maybe we would have played a bit better when we played together.  I think the best we did Woosie or ninth was ninth or 10th.  Hopefully we can do a bit better than that this year.
Q.  What do you think they will do at Bryn Meadow if you are part of the winning team?

BRADLEY DREDGE:  I don't know, I hope we would have a good drink and a good celebration up there.  I still have a lot of friends up there.  My dad still plays up there.
Q.  Name a room after you or something?

BRADLEY DREDGE:  Yeah, that would be nice.
Q.  What's your dad's name?

BRADLEY DREDGE:  Roger.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Thanks very much.  Good luck tomorrow.
