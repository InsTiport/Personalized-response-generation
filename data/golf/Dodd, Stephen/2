Q. One of those days, it just shows how cruel this game can be.
STEPHEN DODD: Yeah, I just got a really bad break on 10 up by the green.  It was in a big hole divot.  I hit my third straight in the face and ended up making seven there.
And just, the next, left it up against the fence and then another one in the bushes and just unraveled, really, just a struggle from then on, really, for some reason.
Q. I guess the good thing was you were in a position where you were able to salvage something and make the weekend?
STEPHEN DODD: Yeah, I'm not sure that's a lot of consolation, to be honest, at the moment.  We'll see what tomorrow brings.  I suppose in that respect I played well for nine holes, so if I can play something similar tomorrow, you never know, I could get a decent score on the board.  So we'll wait and see.
Q. I think the important thing is knowing that you're going into the weekend knowing that there is a big score out there?
STEPHEN DODD: Yeah, there is a score to be had out there, there's no question about that.  The greens are putting lovely, they're soft, if you can drive it in the fairways, it's not, there's plenty of chances out there.  You just have to be careful with some of the flags.  If you miss it in the wrong place it can get tricky then.  But there's a score to be had out there.
