 Q.  Specifically the finish, what was happening up to that point? 
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Not a lot. 

 Q.  So what was the catalyst behind? 
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Slightly slow start, got it going a bit in the middle, but, part way through, holed it around the turn. 
 STEPHEN DODD:  Frustrating around the turn really.  I holed a nice one on 14 and got us going. 

 Q.  How far were you on 14? 
 STEPHEN DODD:  About 25 feet I suppose.  Bradley was close anyway. 

 Q.  And that was all it needed, just the confidence element? 
 STEPHEN DODD:  Nothing was really happening. 
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Took a chance at the par 5. 
 STEPHEN DODD:  Yeah, just missed eagle there on 15. 
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Hit it close on 16. 
 STEPHEN DODD:  And another nice one on 17. 

 Q.  What happened at the last? 
 STEPHEN DODD:  I was just off the side of the green, I had a chip for with 25, 30 feet tops. 

 Q.  Now you're going into the last day with a real shout again. 
 STEPHEN DODD:  You think at least 16 for the day. 
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Have to have a brilliant day tomorrow. 
 STEPHEN DODD:  All we can do is take care of our own game and do our best. 
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Just shoot 61 and hope it's good enough. 

 Q.  No one has got near 62.  That's the low round of the week. 
 STEPHEN DODD:  We just got a bit unfortunate yesterday, just had a poor start.  We made triple on 17 yesterday which kind of -- 
 BRADLEY DREDGE:  Didn't help. 
 STEPHEN DODD:  Had a good day today, which doesn't make up for yesterday but certainly better than we did yesterday.
