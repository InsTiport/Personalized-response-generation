Q. 7-under for the tournament, were conditions quite different from yesterday?
SEI YOUNG: Yeah, today is more holding the ball.  Greens are very softer.  So easy to stop the ball, so yeah, pretty well today.
Q. Do you think it played into your game today, the course conditions?
SEI YOUNG: I mean, a couple holes a little longer, because fairway very wet.  It was raining on and off, on and off, so yeah.  But it's okay.  It was good.
Q. Great attempt at the ninth and that seemed to give you a lot of momentum for the back nine.  Tell us about that.
SEI YOUNG: To the pin is 90 metres and I hit 50 but past the two metres behind, two metres, and I made -- it was straight to the break.  So I just made it after I got momentum and then three in a row birdie, yeah.
Q. And talking about momentum, you finished third in Thailand last weekend.  You're doing pretty well this week, as well.  I know we still have two rounds to go but do you feel you have momentum with you this week?
SEI YOUNG: Yeah, last week, pretty good.  Because first tournament I played in Bahamas, but it was hitting a little tough to me.  Then I went for winter training, figure out which is better for me.  Yeah, I find out and pretty better play last week and momentum is still good today.
