 Q. How would you compare Whistling Straits to the Pete Dye course at French Lick? 
 JASON SCHMUHL: I think they are fairly similar in a lot of ways. Both very intimidating off the tee visually and then a little bit more room once you get up there. 

 Q. Could you just take us through your round today, things you might look to improve upon for tomorrow or things you might look to stay the same?
 JASON SCHMUHL: I actually got off to a good start, and I think I was 1-under after 4 and just started missing fairways, started missing putts, and bogeys, bogeys, doubles, just kind of went backwards. 

 Q. Could you talk a little bit about representing your section of The PGA of America here in a major championship?
 JASON SCHMUHL: It's a great feeling to be here and play with all of the guys you watch on TV every week. You know, obviously I wish I would have played better but still got tomorrow. 

 Q. And this being your first PGA Championship, what are your impressions of the experience so far? 
 JASON SCHMUHL: It's been a great experience. The whole way around, it's been unbelievable. Like I said, I just wish I would have played a little bit better.
