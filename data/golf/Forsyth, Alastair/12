GORDON SIMPSON:  Alastair, a little turnaround at the end there, I think Sergio has just got ahead of you, but you'll be going out with him tomorrow, so that must be a nice thing for the weekend to play with the Ryder Cup man.
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, he's obviously one of the big names here.  He's a Ryder Cup man, he doesn't always come back to Europe, but he's obviously back to his home country.  There will be a big crowd tomorrow, so I will look forward to that.  He's obviously the big name, so it's nice to be in his group.
GORDON SIMPSON:  How about your own game for the last few days, a huge turnaround from last year?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  It was one of those days last year.  It's been good.  To be 5-under after two rounds, I must be playing well.  I'm driving it well, finding a lot of greens and any time I'm missing the greens, I'm staying out of trouble and putting well and just have to keep going as well as I can.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Just a little glitch on the last there.
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, I hooked around a corner and I just had no shot, had to chip out sideways.  I had a chance for a 4, but I didn't make it, but that's Valderrama.
Q.  Must be still hugely satisfying to back up yesterday's round with the round that you had today.
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, obviously I was in good position going out.  I got off to a slow start, a few loose shots early on but I had a couple of putts I almost holed.  I had one shot I dropped, but maybe could have dropped two or three.  Once I got through the first part there, that relaxed me, and I managed to play as well as I had done yesterday.  So that's going to be the key over the weekend I think is to keep that same feeling going.
GORDON SIMPSON:  You made some good figures around the turn there, 8, 9, 11, 12; key holes there.
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, basically I made a nice putt on 8, and that kind of steadied me and then I had a good chance at 10 as well.  I hit a couple of decent putts.  Just basically good golf.
GORDON SIMPSON:  You'll take two 2s on these holes, wouldn't you?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Oh, definitely.
Q.  Did you know about Darren Clarke's 11?  Had anybody told you that on the way around?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  No.

Certainly it's easy to be done.  The third shot was 65 yards from the flag, so I was taking the spin out of play, or I hit it past the pin anyhow, hit a chip shot and make a five.  I suppose you could spin a few back into the water.
Q.  Is that something the pros should know about 17, try not to spin the ball on greens that are so soft?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  I think it's very tempting to just to try to spin it back to the flag.  The temptation is always there.  I think we're just playing to play off it a little bit too much.

The pin is funny.  You can knock it 50 feet past the hole, but if you just spin it an extra four or five feet then you're by the water.
Q.  How far did you hit yours past the hole?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  I placed it probably 30 feet past the hole.  Just spun back a little bit.

I was aiming to do that.  It's easy to do and tempting to spin it.
Q.  Do you have a target this year, start of the year?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Start of the year?  Probably just to try and improve from last year which I haven't done.

So yeah, that I knew that was going to be difficult anyway because I had taken such a big jump from the year before, so I knew that would be difficult but no, that was a target just to try improve on last year.  It's not been as good of a year as last year but it's still been okay.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Ian Poulter gave himself a 1-out-of-10.  Are you as self-critical?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  No.
Q.  What would you give yourself?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  For the season?  Probably about a six.  

GORDON SIMPSON:  Could do better.
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, always.
Q.  The clubs and length of the putts, on the 2s, please?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  The 12th was a 5-iron, ten feet.  And 15 was a 4-iron about 15 feet.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Thank you very much.
