 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Alastair, well-played, a round of 69, joint leader 10-under par.  If you could just sum up your day and your thoughts going into the weekend as joint leader. 
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:   Yesterday I played really, really well.  Today, I felt like a few holes were very, very sloppy.  I missed a lot of fairways, technically I was on the edge of the green, definitely was making even pars.  
 I took an aggressive line at 13 and got a little bit  -- hung it behind the tree, got it in the sand and landed short.  So making 6, that was disappointing.  13 was disappointing, but apart from that, the back nine was pretty solid.  I was pretty pleased.  I was pleased the way I scrambled on the front nine as well.   I was missing a few times and I chipped it close a few times and saving pars pretty easily so that was pleasing as well. 
Yeah, I'm looking forward to the weekend.  There's four or five of us at 10-under, I think, so it's pretty well bunched. 
RODDY WILLIAMS:  We'll take some question, please. 
Q.  Chance on 18?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:   Not really.  I could have just about got up but it was  -- I had a pretty good yardage but wasn't expecting  -- must have been a little bit soft.  Didn't get any spin on it so that was a bit of a disappointment. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:   Yeah, I watch just to see what was going on.  I don't play a lot of attention to it myself.  Day one, two and three, it doesn't affect my game plan or any shots I was going to take on.  Just, really, out of curiosity.  I don't think it will make a difference until the back nine on Sunday, if there's any movement now.

Q.  Inaudible?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:   Yeah, I think I made -- I think I pulled a good 3-iron. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:   Probably a bit both I would think.  I think probably the first few holes, got a decent start and then, there shouldn't be a problem. 
He's a good guy to play with.  With all of the superstars to play with  -- at the moment, it was pretty suitable for both of us. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:   Most of them.  Never played with Tiger, no. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:   A few times, yeah.
