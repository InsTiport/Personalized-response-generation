ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, I started with two bogeys.
Q.  That wasn't in the plan.
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  No.  The first three days everything was going my way.  I hit a good drive down the first and thought I hit it perfect and it just caught the edge of the tree and I was looking for the wind to bring it around and it touched it.  Started with a bad lie in the rough and struggled to make five.  Same thing on the second, I thought I hit a perfect tee shot but made five.

I hung in and gave myself some chances.  Even coming down the end, I was still there the whole day.  The one bad shot I hit was off 16th tee, I was behind a tree but I made a good five.  In fact, I had a great shot into 17.  Just popped off the back edge.  So just one of those days, really.  Everything was just a yard out.  But, obviously I'm disappointed.  Again, it just didn't happen for me today, as simple as that.
Q.  But if you've finished third in an event of this calibre, you know you've performed well?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, I've played the first three days as well as I've ever played.  Today it just didn't quite happen for me.
Q.  Must feel great having a chance to win and being in the thick of it?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, I felt great this morning.  I thought I was going to pull it off, if I just kept on doing what I was doing I would end up moving away, but just didn't happen for me.
Q.  Did you think you would repeat Stephen Gallagher's success a few weeks ago?
ALASTAIR FORSYTH:  Yeah, Stephen won a big one a few weeks ago and I thought it would be great if I could do the same, but as I said, just one of those days and it didn't happen.
