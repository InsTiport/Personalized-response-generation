AYAKO OKAMOTO:  I wasn't feeling real at this moment, but now sitting here, it's coming to reality and a little bit getting nervous.  To play golf in front of many people, I don't feel anything.  I'm not embarrassed or anything, but in front of this many people, to speak, for my personality, this is not the best thing for me to do.  And after that we have a show and then I have to make a speech, and after I finish the speech, I may faint.  That's how nervous I am now.  To be inducted into the hall of fame, especially since two Japanese were inducted before me, Mr. Aoki last year and Ms. Higuchi two years ago, and therefore I thought that I wouldn't get a chance, so this is such an honor to be here and to be inducted into Hall of Fame.  This year we have five members to be inducted, and three of them are unfortunately already passed away.  It's kind of sad.  However, I'm very happy that Karrie is with me, and I've known her since she was 20 years old.  To be here with her at the same time is such an honor and such a happy feeling.  That pretty much sums up my feelings right now.  
 
Q.  In your career you've accomplished so much, you achieved so much.  For example, money queen and all that kind of titles.  But if you could remember any special events in your golf career. 
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  I was awarded with many other awards other than playing golf, but as a golfer, it is such a joy and it is such an honor to win a tournament.  The awards other than golf, of course, I'm very happy with it.  However, it comes with the responsibility and so forth.  So the most important and happy memories are coming from the winning of the tournaments.  But the first tournament that I played in Japan, the debut tournament, the first shot, when I won, that was the great feeling.  And then I came to America, and then the first time that I won in the States by playoff, and all the major tournaments, even though I didn't win, all the sceneries, all the scenes are embedded in my memory.  So like the 1980s, ten years, are very, very rich in memories and a good time.  
 
Q.  Can you talk about what it felt like when you first heard that you were being inducted?  I also want to ask about the wonderful memorabilia that you've lent us to put on display. 
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  The first part of the question, first time I heard about Hall of Fame induction was back in May, and through golf-related business people, the former LPGA Commissioner, Mr. Ty Votaw, wanted to speak with me in person.  I got that message.  A couple days later I spoke with him directly, and I totally lost my words.  I was so, so happy to hear the news.  The second part would be yesterday was the first time I went up to the museum and all the locker room exhibit and everything.  To have Ayako Okamoto on a locker up there, it's just indescribable in words.  I could say about other people, but for myself, I can't be too extravagant.  However, I am just so unbelievably happy and honored.  The reason why I feel like that is all the people in the locker room, they practically made the history of golf in this world, and to be a part of it, it is such an honor.  
 
Q.  Two questions:  What do you consider your greatest achievement in golf? 
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  It's difficult.  Thinking back, it could be my personality.  For example, I am a person who doesn't want somebody else has something, I'm not that -- I shouldn't say greedy, but I'm not that really wanting a person.  And the other thing is I'm the type that no matter how long it takes, I am going to make it there.  In other words, no matter how slow it is, just step by step, even though people around me sometimes do not understand me.  There's an Aesop fable The Tortoise and the Hare; you probably know the rabbit took a nap, and then in the meantime the tortoise just won the race.  I am that kind of -- that's my favorite story, and I'm just like little by little walking towards my goal. 
 
Q.  Second question, are you happy to see more players from Japan playing in the United States, and do you feel like perhaps you influenced or inspired them?
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  When I came to the States, everybody was opposed to the idea of playing in the States, especially the media people.  However, many, many years have passed, and I am now inducted to the Hall of Fame, and currently all the people who are involved in golf are suggesting to young players in Japan to play abroad or play on the LPGA Tour.  That's the way it is now; it has been changed.  It depends on that player, if she could be successful in this country.  But it would be great if we could have another fourth Japanese Hall of Fame inductee someday, and then I would feel that I contributed to the part of it.  
 
Q.  Who were your friends on the LPGA when you played?  Who did you look up to?
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  Patty Rizzo, Patty Sheehan.  It's been a while, so I forgot a lot of names.  They were very, very nice to me when I was playing on the Tour.  For example, in the locker room, sometimes some notice would be posted and then some words, when I didn't understand it I would ask another player, and they all took time to explain what it is and describe it to me.  Everybody really pitched in and helped me.  
 
Q.  When you said when you first came to the States and people were opposed to the idea, why did they not want you to play in the United States?
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  At the time in Japan, economically it was very bubbly, not a very good period.  Therefore the Tour itself was very popular, and I was one of the very popular players.  So if I decide to play outside of Japan, that means maybe that's going to affect the sponsorship and things like that, and therefore that was the main reason to get that kind of position.  But I just wanted to go for my goal, and being selfish, I decided to leave Japan and play the LPGA. 
 
Q.  Did it affect your popularity?
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  I came to the States, and then I felt like a fish in the big pond of water, and it was so free and so vibrant, and I totally enjoyed that.  People followed me on the LPGA Tour in Japan, so the popularity didn't decrease.  
 
Q.  You heard the news in May and then in June you came to the U.S. Open in Colorado and perhaps you received many greetings from your friends.  How did you feel at that time?
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  As you get older, sometimes your feelings are a little bit kind of like numb.  Many people's greetings and congratulations to me in Colorado, and of course I was very happy and I was very pleased.  However, it's different when you come here and then see all those things.  This has much more impact.  I feel more strongly about the induction.  
 
Q.  The language barrier was there when you came to play in the States.  Talk about the difficulties. 
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  As a golfer, whether I played in Japan or the States or Europe or Australia, it really didn't matter; there's no language.  Golf rules are the same thing all over the world, and playing in America, as long as you learned the local rules.  Even though I can't speak English, I had a confidence that I could play. And of course there are some language problems, but now, come to think of it, I was in the States, I lived in the States for ten years in the 1980s, and I really didn't learn -- didn't master the language.  So it's a little bit of regret there.  However, as a golfer-wise, I am very satisfied, and I could play as a golfer, I have that kind of a policy that I could play anywhere in the world.  
 
Q.  The presenter will be Beth Daniel.  You know so many people on the Tour, but why did you pick Beth as your presenter?
 
AYAKO OKAMOTO:  I thought about many people, and this is not something that I can just decide.  So I talked to many people who were in the business, and we came up with many names such as Nancy Lopez or Juli Inkster or Patty Sheehan, and everybody was on the list.  When I tried to think of the speech itself I thought perhaps Beth would be the best choice for my presenter this occasion.  But I wanted to ask many, many people.
