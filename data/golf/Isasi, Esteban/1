CARLOS FRANCO:   We did it with love and lots of hard work for Latin America.  Argentina has surpassed itself by having done this event.  The course was in excellent condition, but when you play well or bad, it doesn't matter.  It has nothing to do with the course.  We had a good week.  Playing in teams, foursomes and four-ball is difficult, but I think that we have done a good job.  We came in third or fourth place, I don't know yet, which is a victory for our country.  
 
Q.  Argentina and Paraguay ended up in the Top  3 positions; is this good? 
 
CARLOS FRANCO:   Yes, I actually thought Argentina could win, but when you have to compete against the best, coming in second, in case this is the final position, is actually a very good position.  Esteban played well, even though at some point, I think that he got nervous.  We missed many putts maybe because we were both nervous.  The galleries, I think that they have behaved more than well.  At some points, we felt like we were the local team.
