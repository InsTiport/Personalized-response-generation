JIMMY POWELL:  I know it.  That's the bad news.  No, I played very well.  Actually, I played well on both sides.  And the front side, I know you've heard this many times, but it could have been a whole lot better.  I missed two 4-footers for birdies on 2 and 3.  And really never had it outside of maybe ten feet in the whole nine holes.  I think I birdied the last four, didn't I? 
 
JIMMY POWELL:  6, 7, 8 and 9.  They were all just real close putts.  Back nine, I sort of -- just couldn't get anything going.  Then I bogeyed the 17th hole from right in front of the green.  I'm 2 there.  Hit a bad chip shot, then I 3-putted.  I made a good putt on 18 for birdie that sort of -- that helps, especially after you do something like you did on 17. 
 
JIMMY POWELL:  Well, I started out again, birdied No. 1 from probably about four feet.  Then next birdie I think was at 6.  I hit it about a foot from the hole there. 
 
JIMMY POWELL:  Yeah, little sand there.  The next hole is a par 5.  I hit it probably ten feet there and made it.  17, I hit it about a foot from the hole. 
 
JIMMY POWELL:  Excuse me, No. 8. 
 
JIMMY POWELL:  7-iron.  Then on 9, I hit it probably about eight feet, eight, nine feet, with a 7-iron. 
 
JIMMY POWELL:  That hole played -- was playing hard today, against the wind today.  Yesterday it was downwind.  I hit a real good drive, hit a 4-iron, probably 18, 20 feet.  Had to come up over a rise.  I got a pretty good read on it from Dale.  Dale had to putt almost on the same line that I was.  I noticed it didn't break very much.  Hit a beautiful putt there, just dead center. 
 
JIMMY POWELL:  I want to win the tournament.  If you win the MASTERCARD, that's wonderful, but not even close, you know, if you win the big one.  I'd love to win a major.  I don't know if I can or not, but I'm going to sure try. 
 
JIMMY POWELL:  Thank you, sir.
