 Q. What did you think of the week?
 MIKE MALASKA: Well, really good, except it looks like I'm going to miss the cut by one. 
 But the golf course was great and it was a lot of fun playing it. I played a number of Majors and I think this course was probably the most fair. The greens were tough, but you knew where you had to hit it and they didn't, it didn't get out of control any place. 
 So there wasn't anywhere where you were, you didn't know what you had, there wasn't a safe place to play to, and the fairways were plenty wide and it's, it was a great week. I played good it looks like just one shy of playing on the weekend.

 Q. Do you have a take away moment from the week?
 MIKE MALASKA: Oh, well, yeah, I my daughter caddying for me. My goal was to play tomorrow, because tomorrow's my 55th birthday and I thought that that would be a pretty good birthday present, but just having her here, so being able to play well with her here caddying, that was a lot of fun.
