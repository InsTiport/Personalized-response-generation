 Q. Overall just your experience here, any comments on it?
 MIKE MALASKA: Well, it was fun. Obviously I would have liked to have played better. I struggled with the driver, which I usually hit it fairly well. 
 And yesterday was tough. And in the wind, this golf course set up the way it is, it was a hard, it's a hard golf course. So if you're not playing all the time, which most of us aren't that aren't on the TOUR, it was tough. But it was fun. It's always fun to be here. 

 Q. Can you describe your birdie on 6 today?
 MIKE MALASKA: Oh, well, I hit a really good 4-iron in there about 15 feet and made it for birdie. I mean that was kind of a, that's a hard hole. Especially today. 
 Yesterday it was a lot easier because it was down wind. So that was a highlight of the day. 

 Q. What does it mean that your daughter caddied for you? What does that mean to have her out here with you?
 MIKE MALASKA: She's playing for the U of A now and for her to be able to be in these Majors and see what it's like to be here and -- because it's different on that side of the ropes than watching it. It feels different, everything. 
 I've been to a lot of big tournaments, but when you're inside the ropes, it's a whole different feeling than outside. So it's fun for her and it's fun for me to have her here.
