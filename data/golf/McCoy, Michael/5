Q.   Tell me your thoughts about your round and just being here today?
MICHAEL MCCOY:   It was a great day.   It was a great day.   I had a lot of fun.   I made some nice putts.   I 3â€‘putted from places I shouldn't have and that.

Q.   Can you give me any specifics?
MICHAEL MCCOY:   The first hole I kind of had a black out.

Q.   Was it nerves?
MICHAEL MCCOY:   I think maybe a little nerves.   I miss played the putt but probably there was a lot going on in my head, but I made a couple really nice putts to save par and made a couple nice putts for birdie. 
They say the course changes from Wednesday to Thursday and it did. 

Q.   How so for you?
MICHAEL MCCOY:   It was a little firmer in places and I misjudged clubs a few times, but it was great.   I had a lot of support out there.   I enjoyed that. 

Q.   Your thoughts about just this whole experience for you?
MICHAEL MCCOY:   It's just been magical.   Just been a magical week being around these great players and this great venue, this marvelous club. 
So it's just been beautiful weather, it was aces all the way around.

Q.   What do you do the rest of today and then getting ready for tomorrow?
MICHAEL MCCOY:   I'll go say hello to some friends that followed me, probably go hit a few boys, just unwind and that, put my feet up.   And have a little relaxation.   I got to get up early tomorrow.   Just enjoy the day.
