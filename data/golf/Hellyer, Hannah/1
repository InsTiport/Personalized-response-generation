Q. Hannah, first round in the LPGA tournament here.  How did you feel stepping on to the first tee this morning?
HANNAH HELLYER: It was pretty exciting.  I don't think I really was thinking straight.  My heart was pounding out of my chest.  But I just had to kind of focus and try and get the ball in the fairway.  It was good.
Q. How big of a step up is it for someone like you who's basically a club professional to come up here and try and play with these gals?
HANNAH HELLYER: It's amazing.  I can't believe that I'm here.  I'm living my dream, so just want to keep pursuing.
Q. I understand it wasn't that long ago you were thinking about maybe not even continuing with a career in golf, and yet here you are.  That's a big change.
HANNAH HELLYER: For sure.  I'm glad that I stuck it out.  I think that golf has a lot of highs and lows, and you've just really got to be -- you have to persist.
Q. What was the story of your round today?
HANNAH HELLYER: I couldn't find the fairway, so that was fun.  And I hit a lot of diverse shots, learned a lot about placement, so that was really good.  But hopefully tomorrow will be a little more down the middle and on the green, maybe one-putt, two-putt, a little boring golf.  We'll see how it goes.
Q. I know you've been around these players for a long time, but playing in this tournament, does it put things into perspective just how good they are?
HANNAH HELLYER: Yeah, it's amazing, and I've learned a lot just even with my playing partners today.  Just going to try and take that to the next event.
