  MODERATOR:   We're here with I.K. Kim after your final round at the Kia Classic.   I.K., you're now mathematically qualified for the International Crown team.   How does it feel?
I.K. KIM:   Feels great.   Is wasn't really thinking about the whole thing because of playing Kia tournament.   I wasn't really focusing on Crown very much.
But it feels nice.   Feel very lucky to have such great teammates, you know, and representing Korea as well.

Q.   You talked about representing Korea.   Playing as a team with other players representing your country, is that a new thing for you?   What's the excitement level heading into that tournament? 
I.K. KIM:   I don't see it as competition so much.   I think it's more like celebrating because it's different format, and I think will create different atmosphere for the fans who actually not follow golf so much in Korea.   They actually will cheer for not only Korea, but a lot of countries will be interest in this game.
I think that's what I'm supporting and I'm looking forward to. 

Q.   It's a match play format.   Have you had a chance to look at the other teammates involved?   What would be your strategy going into the tournament?
I.K. KIM:   It's long way actually.   It's in July, I believe.   But I love match play, you know. 
But I feel like everybody is family out here anyway.   I think it will be more celebration of who is going to play better.   So I think they'll be fun. 

Q.   Congratulation, I.K.   Should be a great tournament. 
I.K. KIM:   Thank you.
