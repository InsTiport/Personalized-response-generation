   DANA GROSS-RHODE: IK, great round again. Put yourself right in contention for the lead. You've been in this position before. How does it feel? 
 IN KYUNG KIM: Very excited. I play well last couple days. You know, fortunate to play well and in contention. 
 I like it. I like to be in contention.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: So do you like the pressure? What does the pressure do for you? 
 IN KYUNG KIM: I would say it's more like a strong feeling, you know, you have. I don't really get, well, pressure, I think. I get more excited.
 You know, I've been enjoying playing in the last group, because you really have -- you know, when you have pressure, that means you have a chance to win the tournament, so I'm very excited. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: The course today, a lot of people seem to be attacking the course. Do you feel like you're able to go at more of the pins, or does the course force you to play smart? 
 IN KYUNG KIM: Well, I think both. Because, I mean, front nine, I really didn't have many birdie chances because how the course setting. It's really hilly on the fairway. Sometimes it just goes somewhere else that I didn't really expect it. 
 I think you really have to be patient on the golf course. And hopefully I can make more birdies on the front and then... 
 I always been one shot back this week. I really think I have a chance tomorrow if I get started early. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: I guess just looking forward to tomorrow, what do you do to prepare for the final round? 
 IN KYUNG KIM: Tomorrow I'll get some rest and come out here and hit some balls and, you know, just normal things that I would do. I mean, make myself better, good, for the last round.
 I don't know what to expect actually, you know, but I'm happy that I -- I mean, last two years I really have been playing this good on this golf course, so I think I improve a lot from last years. 
 I'm just very excited. I'll be really having fun tomorrow. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. That's all that matters. Thank you very much. Good luck.
 IN KYUNG KIM: Thanks.
