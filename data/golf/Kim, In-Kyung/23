 Q.  How would you assess your play after two days to be in the position that you are?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I just wanted to make the best out of it, really.   
 Q.  How challenging have the conditions been?  Obviously today getting the worst end of it, but how is that affecting your game and your strategy?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I think this was kind of as worse as it would get.  I kind of expected rain.  But I feel really good my game.  It's just not easy to play pace of play in this kind of weather.  But I think I was able to manage it just fine.  But yeah, it was quite tough out there.   
 Q.  As we look ahead to the weekend, you're leading.  How do you feel about that and what do you expect over the next couple days?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I don't think I can expect anything, really, in this place.  But I really enjoy playing out here.  Even the rain, I don't know, if I had to play golf somewhere else, this would be the golf course that I would play in the rain.   
 Q.  Will you approach anything differently over the next couple days, going into Saturday as the leader, rather than a chaser, perhaps?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I haven't really thought about it yet.  But I'll look at what I did and maybe I can make some kind of plan.
