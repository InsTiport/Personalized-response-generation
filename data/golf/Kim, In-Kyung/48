 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
I.K. KIM:   The stroke play, for sure.   I think that we both played very decent.   But I'm just a little disappointed on making a few mistakes on the same holes.   But other than that, I think we did well and I think that every day it's going to gradually get better.   So hopefully we'll do a little better job tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Na Yeon, can you go over your emotion teeing off today this morning?   
NA YEON CHOI:   I felt very honored, especially I saw a lot of Korean flags over there and even a lot of American or different country people cheering for us.   That was very nice and like amazing.   
And I was a little bit nervous on the first tee, because that was a very special and unique moment.   But I think that we handled it very well.   But like the resultsâ€‘wise, we missed, we lost, but we played together very well and we understand our game a little bit more.   So hopefully we'll have a better result tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Now does that change the strategy heading into tomorrow and this weekend's play?   
NA YEON CHOI:   I think so.   I mean, I think we are very close to the win, but we couldn't.   So we're going to talk a lot about to Inbee and So Yeon.   They played very well today, so we might get some tips for strategy on the course and then just go out tomorrow again and then maybe win tomorrow.
