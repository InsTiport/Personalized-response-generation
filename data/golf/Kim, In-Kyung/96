   JASON TAYLOR: Thanks for coming in. Nice round. You maintained your lead, and going into the final round 11-under overall. Just talk about your day.
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, I had a good day. I had a good par on No. 1. Second hole wasn't easy second shot, but I had a chance to make birdie. I had a lot of chances, and I tried to not make like many mistakes. 
 Overall, I'm very happy to be where I am. 
 JASON TAYLOR: Good. Questions. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes. I tried to not try too hard today because the wind was gusty. If I tried too hard I would be pretty much frustrate with every shot, because the wind and everything, conditions, it wasn't easy today. 
 So what was the question? Sorry. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, because eventually when it's windy and you're on the top or you're on the leaderboard, I try to not make myself like in position. Don't think about the win, you know. Eventually just play well and make no mistakes. That was my goal. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I'm just -- she's really, really nice person. I'm really happy to play with her. That means I'm playing well, especially on the weekend. I really respect her. She's such a good player, and I'm a little punk kid, Korean kid. 
 Anyway, yeah, it's fun out there. It was fun. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Today it was windy, and I think we tried to do what we need to do. We just talk about -- all day we talk. Yeah, Lorena and I, Good job. Nice birdie. Yeah. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes, No. 12 I think. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Actually, last couple two days and today I had couple lipped out even I had really good putts. Jason told me this green is not that easy, it's not that easy to read the green. 
 So I tried to putt it with a right speed, and then I think this worked on that hole.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, I was like, Oh, I got it. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I just wanted to play my game, hit the greens and the fairways and give myself a chance to be win, you know. Yeah, no mistakes, keep it simple, don't try too hard, and have fun. I really enjoyed it. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Well, the green, this green is like you have to read perfectly, right, and then with the speed and the slope and the wind, it changes a lot out there. So I didn't have time to focus on her game today. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Oh, she's 10-under? I didn't know that. 
 JASON TAYLOR: You're 11 and she's 10. 
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Like yesterday. It'll be fun. I mean, yeah. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Right. Well, tomorrow is another day. You never know what's going to happen. I'm going to keep it up and try to do my best. I think I have to keep going and do what need to do. Calm myself down a little bit and, yeah... 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, I think there are so many experienced players out there. I think I'm -- what's the word? I'm not as experienced, but sometimes it's better to be not really -- I mean, first time. It's my second year. I feel like I'm getting there in every situation. 
 When I have pressure on me sometimes I frustrate. Everyone heart beats when having a trouble, but I think I just like to have the feeling, I mean, the, you know, the competition. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I just really want to be the best in what I do. Like last year in my rookie year, I'm still like immature. I'm only twenty years old, so I learn a lot of things. I thought golf was who am then what I do, and I learned golf is what I do and what I like to do, but it's not me. It's not 100% me. I'm another person, you know. 
 I like to listen music. I can live without music, but I also can -- I just learn golf is what I do, not who I am. So when I have bad time out there I feel like I'm so like dummy, you know. I play like ten years and I'm making shots like that. 
 But not anymore. I just love to be out there. Yeah. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes. Yes. Really help me. I thought if I have bad round I'm -- I feel I'm terrible person. Not anymore. This is what I do. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Well, still me. It's still me, but I'm more prepared than before. More relaxing out there, yeah. Make putts that I need to make. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Third round. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Rochester. Last year. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: She makes the playoff. 
 JASON TAYLOR: All right. 
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you.
