 Q. Well played today. You had a great start.
 I.K. KIM: Yeah, I played very well. I played solid. I was hitting fairways and greens. I mean, I played well and I made more putts today. 

 Q. That was the big difference?
 I.K. KIM: Yeah. 

 Q. And how do you keep it going for tomorrow?
 I.K. KIM: I don't know, it happens sometimes -- it happened a couple of times this week, not very often. 

 Q. What was that on the last, a 3-putt? 
 I.K. KIM: Just missed a little one, but it just happens. You just have to get over it. 
 Overall it was a great round. Reading the greens was really tough today. I putted better today and hopefully I can continue tomorrow.
