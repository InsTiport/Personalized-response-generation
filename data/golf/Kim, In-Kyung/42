 Q.   Obviously disappointed.   You gotta be pretty pleased with where your game's at.   What happened on 18 there?  
I.K. KIM:   Actually hit my best tee shot that I've hit the last few days.   But it was tricky distance.   It was in between clubs, so I couldn't really hit five hybrid.   So I had to go to the right side.   Otherwise I would be long.   But yeah.   
   
 Q.   The par putt on 18, was it just didn't break as much as you thought?  
I.K. KIM:   Yeah, it didn't.  
   
 Q.   Have you had that putt any this week at all?  
I.K. KIM:   I have no idea.   I didn't practice that long, but yeah, I've been missing quite a few of those.   I think it's just the speed of the green.  
   
 Q.   No bogeys today.   You played pretty well.   Are you pretty happy with the round or are you more disappointed that you didn't‑‑  
I.K. KIM:   Yeah, I'm happy, but I played a lot of playoffs, but I haven't won one yet.   So just kind of‑‑ it was in the back of my mind.   But she deserves it.
