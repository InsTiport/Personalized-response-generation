   JASON TAYLOR: Thanks for coming in. Nice job today. 8-under overall, currently in the lead right now. Just talk about your round today.  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, start with good birdie. Chipped it in on No. 1, so it was a really good start. I had some really good saves on the front side also.   
 But, yeah, I mean, it was really cold this morning. I was just like go out there and do my best, and, you know, hopefully I can start early, which I did.   
 Back nine was -- I think wind picked it up, more windier, back nine. But, I mean, I missed -- I left some putts out there, but I also had some good saves. Yeah, I had a good round.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I been practicing -- I mean, I been working on my swing for a while by myself last week. I think it really helped. I mean, I hit a lot of golf balls on the range last week. Boy, I just hit the target, that's it.   
  
  Q. Are you generally that good of a player in the wind?   
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Well, I mean, there's a bunch of them have more experience than I do, but I have a little lower ball flight so I think that helps me a little bit with the wind.   
 And if it's not raining I'm okay with everything, any conditions.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: It's not like windy-windy, but it's kind of on and off, so club selection wasn't that easy. Jason and I are -- tried to figure out what's the best yardage for it. I think it worked out today.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: 12.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, yeah, that one was really tricky. And No. 15, the par-5, the green was tricky because it's in the shade, so you really can't see were was the slope. So that was tricky for me, too.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, I had 7-iron. I think I had 130 front yardage, and was into the wind. It's like left is bunker and right is bunker. It's only like ten-yard gap. With the wind you have to hit it like, I don't know, straight just doesn't work at this time. I don't know.   
 So it was kind of unique to have some lobs, but I had a good up-and-down there to save par.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I feel I'm getting better. I try to get better every day. I practice hard and I have a good caddie this week.   
 Yeah, hopefully I can win. I just want to play good and have some fun, you know.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Well, it's not like junior golf. Like before I played like ten tournaments a year and win one or two tournaments. I play 20, over 20, more than 40 tournaments and I haven't won any.   
 But I feel I'm getting there. The competition is really hard and tough, so I like to play in the -- to challenge myself. I think it's been fun, and I think I'm going to have more fun.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes, I did. Yeah, that was a great tournament. Yeah, it helps a lot, because I -- like some other player just came from Korea, and it's really different traveling all around the city, which is different culture and language.   
 So I think it was -- yeah, it helps me a lot with my language and culture that I learned earlier. So, yeah.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I was 17. Yes.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I always wanted to come here and learn more about golf, different -- you know, I just wanted to play USGA tournaments and compete with the best golfers.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Golfer, I look up to Tiger Woods, Se-Ri Pak, Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb, Juli Inkster. I can go for ten minutes.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Into the weekend, uh, 8:50 tee, yeah. I mean, third round. I didn't play in the last final round.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: It's really exciting. I just like to be on the leaderboard, have a chance to win the tournament and not too frustrate. Like when you're behind, really frustrate, even though you're playing on the weekend.   
 Yeah, I think I'm going to have some fun. I just want to enjoy.   
 JASON TAYLOR: All right.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, it's a good question. For me, I really wanted to learn English because I just wanted to have conversation with other, not just Korean people, not -- you know, it's other than golf.   
 It's kind of my hobby to learn English, and I'm learning Japanese and other language, too. It's kind of like get away from golf, and I'm having fun with it, you know, learning language.   
 But I don't think it's good thing to force people to speak the language. That's just my opinion. But I think it's good to speak English. If you're speaking good English I think you have more presentation, advantage. Yes, certainly.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, I was really shy. I have shy personality, but I'm more outgoing now than before, I think. That's good, because some people say, How are you, hi, even though you don't know each other.   
 But before I was really shy to say hello or ask, How are you doing? But now it's kind of -- yeah, I had to stop saying kinda or like. It's like, you know.   
 Yeah, I had an apartment in Orlando and it was by myself and I didn't like it, so I just moved to San Diego. It's with my friend.   
 JASON TAYLOR: All right. Thanks so much.  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you.
