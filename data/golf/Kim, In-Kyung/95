   JASON TAYLOR: Congratulations.
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you very much.
 JASON TAYLOR: Good to see you again. 
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes, you too. Thank you. 
 JASON TAYLOR: Talk a little bit about your day.
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Today, before I start I just wanted to play -- I didn't want to change any plans, just hit the fairways and greens and give myself chance. 
 I had -- I didn't have rough day, but I had to get up-and-down from many holes, which I did. I think I did a good job with that. 
 Last three holes left and I was two-shot lead. Only I need was one birdie from two holes and then I can't lose the tournament, so I just wanted to have one birdie and I made two. 
 JASON TAYLOR: There you go. All right. Questions. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I think it was more like excitement. I just couldn't go to bed. I just keep thinking what I'm going to do tomorrow. I just don't want to think -- you know, I still have one more day to go. I think I have the confidence that I can win the tournament, but just try to bear down, you know, bear down a little bit. 
 I think I went through the course for ten times at least last night. But, yeah, so I tried to listen to music but it didn't help. I tried to draw things but I just couldn't stop thinking about golf. I think I slept like one or two hours last night. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: When I listen to music, if it's like love story I just try to create what is love like, but I just couldn't do it last night. I was just like messing around. But, yeah, something like that. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes, I mean, you can see -- I drank I think more than five bottle of water and two bananas and two granola bars. 
 I just felt weak because I didn't slept last night, so I just tried to eat well during the tournament. I had to focus, so I just tried to not lose focus. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I think it's going to take a week to talk about that, but it's -- well, everyone say it's a dream come true, but still I'm in a process, getting better. I mean, getting ready for big steps. 
 I think this is just a start in my career. I'm really honored to win this tournament on this golf course, which I really like. I think this golf course really fits me, and I just -- I just don't know. I'm just speechless. 
 Yeah, everyone says, like, I didn't know I'm going to win, you know, after they win the tournament. I didn't know they were going to win. 
 But for myself, I just kind of -- I thought I just kind of knew I'm going to win, but I tried to not say it loud, which is -- yes, I did. I'm glad I be here. 
 I mean, I just want to thank to everyone that support me back in Korea and my sponsors. I can't thank enough to others, so I just want to keep playing well.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Win the tournament? I just had a really good feeling on Thursday round. Jason and I, I ask him about what's faith is, faith. I heard about that word all the time, but I didn't really know what it really meant. He told me it's more than believe, right? He told me more than believe. 
 I was just studying that word all week, to have faith in myself. To just go out there and have really fun, you know, just like keep playing what I really did before. I think it really worked, yeah. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: On the 16, par-3, I had a 7-iron. It was right to left wind and I had -- I left a bad miss to the left, which is -- I don't know, I think I just pulled it a little bit and the wind bring to the left. 
 I hit the pin and had two-putt and made bogey. I was still two-shot lead, and I just, you know -- what was the question? 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes, yes. But after 16 I thought, Just make one birdie and one par then I can win the tournament. Even though Angela make two birdies, I'm still one-shot lead end of the tournament, so that means I'm going to win. 
 So I just try and make one birdie. And 17 I had bad shot, awful, to the left. I thought it was bad. Fortunately I was in the bunker and I had 70 yards. I had been practice 70 yards for a long time. That's my kind of my favorite shot, and I knew I'm going to left myself to the right side of the uphill, like, putt, and I made the putt. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Oh, she did? Thank you. No, I don't practice a lot, but I remember I had those shots before. At that point, I just had a vision of how I'm going to hit it. 
 I just did it and I just didn't think about anything. Just hit 70 yards with this one right at the pin, the right side of the pin. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: The thing is, 18 was, yeah, I was nervous. It was excitement, everything. But par putts, a lot of par putts on the front nine was more stressful than anything. 
 Like 18 wasn't -- I can't compare to 18 as No. 1 on No. 1 par putts I made. Those are more stressful and like you got to make, so, yeah. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: On that putt I was glad Angela putted first and then I can see. I just wanted to try two-putting with the right speed, and it just went in like some great players does. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Just like every moment that I had in practice and other people, just my coach, family, just sleep -- I was overwhelmed, so I kind of like bawling a little bit, but I tried to not cry. It was too happy. It was like happy cry. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Well, I mean, the funny thing is I never thought -- like I didn't know I had to qualify for the LPGA. I didn't know they had Qualifying school out there, so I just like, I can't go to PGA TOUR so I'm going to LPGA, which my dad told me -- when I was younger I said, I'm going to play the Masters like the other, you know great players, Jack Nicklaus did.
 And my dad is like, You're a girl. You can't do that. I mean, see the reality. I'm like, No I'm going to play. But I'm glad -- I don't want to mention her name, but I'm glad she does that because I think that's a really great thing, to keep on going with her dream. So, yeah, something like that. 
 So I always thought I'm going to the LPGA and play my best game and compete with the great players. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I just couldn't understand anything, because I went to South Carolina and they have different accent also, so I just couldn't get it until half year, I think. Yeah, I think it took half year to get like say something what I wanted and what I need. 
 One time I left by myself -- I mean they left me at the golf course, and I didn't know they all went back to the house. I was waiting for two hours. I had a phone, but I just didn't know what to say, you know, to them, so I just wait two hours. And.
 The golf course director came to me, What are you doing here? I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing here. Just help me. And he just drop me at the house. 
 Yeah, a lot of episode, yeah, first year. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Actually, my dad always travel with me when I was younger when I was in Korea. But my mom, it's great I can share a room and have dinner and have chat with my mom. It's a great thing. She doesn't really talk about golf all the time because she doesn't know about like other parents. 
 But she always support me and believing in me more than I believe myself. I think that's why I can be here today. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: I can't say I live in the United States, but I'm staying at my friend's house in San Diego. Yeah. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, it's 8:50. Yeah, I'm okay. But airport in San Francisco airport, not the Oakland. 
 JASON TAYLOR: All right. 
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you very much.
