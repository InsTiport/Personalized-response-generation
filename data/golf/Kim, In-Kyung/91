   JASON TAYLOR: All right, In-Kyung. Welcome back to the media center. Another great day for you, 4-under today, 14-under overall. One stroke back from the lead going into the final round. What do you think about that? 
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Not bad. Yeah. I mean I had a good round. I think I hit the green more than yesterday and the last couple days. So I had some trouble with the speed of the putting green. I had some great putts, but I came back pretty strong. I was holding there, so I'm very pleased about today's round.
 JASON TAYLOR: Questions? 

 Q. When you're going into a round trailing, do you kind of keep an eye on what Lorena is doing? Were you kind aware that she was having trouble?
 IN-KYUNG KIM: The leader was -- actually. Lindsey -- well, Lorena, yeah. Absolutely. I knew that they would make low scores. 
 It was a little windy, but I knew they were going to make birdie, so I tried to play hole by hole, have some birdie chances. And Lindsey didn't make any mistakes, I think. She had some mistakes, but she was up-and-down from everywhere, so yeah. She had a good round.

 Q. Were the conditions a little tougher today?
 IN-KYUNG KIM: It was a little windier than yesterday, but on Thursday I played in the afternoon tee time, and it was pretty windy, too, so I think it was pretty similar. Yeah, similar direction wind, yeah, the third round, I mean Thursday round?

 Q. With the wind, 7-under Lindsey, you said she made some mistakes, but I guess she always recovered from that?
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes. I think she was pretty good birdie putts. She made I think a couple 10-footers and 15-footers. But she had very solid round. 
 I don't think she made bogey today, so that's pretty cool, because yesterday I had like seven birdies, one eagle, two bogeys, but she had a more solid round. 
 JASON TAYLOR: All right. 
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you.
