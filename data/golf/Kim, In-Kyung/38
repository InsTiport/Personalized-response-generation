 Q.   How was it out there?   Obviously windy conditions for everybody.   Not a lot of rounds under par.   What was your approach going into the day?  
I.K. KIM:   Same game plan, but I just knew where the pin position is going to be.   I play well on those pin positions.   Just the winds were I think tough to judge.   
 That you can see I didn't have much chances on the way.   I just kind of save pars.   I think I play well.   Just missed opportunity on 17.   I misjudged the speed of the green.   I think that really cost the tournament.  
   
 Q.   When you look back on this week, what do you take out of it?   Obviously not the results you would've wanted, but you have to take some positives going into the rest of the season.   
I.K. KIM:   Yeah, I work very hard at it, so, you know, there are some things I still want to keep working on, so I think it was good learning curve.  
   
 Q.   With the final group you three were battling back and forth the whole way; what was that like?   
I.K. KIM:   I think we all did our best, you know.   Sei Young hit a lot of good shots; just didn't make putts until, I don't know.   She had a good save on 16 and 17.   I think that's why she's on the playoff.   
Inbee miss few birdie chances on the parâ€‘5.   Think that's why she's on the playoff.   We all had chances.   Just so hard to, you know, tell who did better or worse.   
But I think end of the day, it's just really close.   Yeah.
