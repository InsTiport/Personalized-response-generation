   THE MODERATOR: Let's talk about the day and you got to watch it firsthand when Catriona Matthew got off to such a big lead in the front. 
 I.K. KIM: That's what I was trying to do on the front nine, but she kept making putts. She was so high so she could stop the ball on the green. She played awesome, you know? 
 We didn't really get any closer to her, so I don't think she got much -- you know, any nervous or pressure. I think she had her own kind of momentum going, so I'm very happy for her and, you know, it was nice for her. 
 THE MODERATOR: Another strong finish here at this tournament. It must feel good for you. 
 I.K. KIM: Definitely. Even last year, other than last year I have not finished top-10 before, so this is -- second? Did I finish tied for second? 
 THE MODERATOR: Yes, tied for second. 
 I.K. KIM: You know, what can I say? I was in contention and I got to watch Catriona play, and I've learned a lot today. 

 Q. What was the toughest part of this tournament for you? 
 I.K. KIM: Catriona went to Japan as well, so I can't complain about jet lag or anything, but definitely this week I think that the green was firmer than last year, and Catriona hits -- basically it fits her game well. 
 You still got to make putts, and I think that's what she did today. 

 Q. Looking forward to next year, I guess? 
 I.K. KIM: Yes, I will be ready for next year, I guess. Long way to go, but this is definitely one of my favorite tournaments and the weather has been -- we're just telling each other how great the weather it, so I look forward to coming back next year.
