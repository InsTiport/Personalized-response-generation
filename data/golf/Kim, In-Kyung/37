Q. Not too terrible a day for you.  Describe the conditions and how you approached the round.I.K. KIM: I don't know where to start, because I came back early this morning.  Nothing really special.  The course was a little bit wet earlier, especially on the par-5s.  When I hit the ground twice and the bounce, I can definitely get the mud.  Other than that, the course condition was very good.  But it is long golf course for me. No. 18 and 9 is not really a par-4 for me.  I think I managed that well today.  I get to make some putts on the par-3s, so I was able to --Q. You say you had a quick turnaround.  You finished yesterday's first round and then had to come right back down.  How does that affect your body physically and for that matter emotionally?I.K. KIM: I think we are all in the same kind of story right now.  So I have been through this kind of weather delay before and it is tough to come out and play that early, but you have to do what you have to do.  I hit a lot of good putts, just wasn't -- I feel like I was hitting the spots yesterday and even earlier this morning.  It's kind of nice to see the ball going in the hole.Q. That is sort of a motivation for the weekend and just trying to get yourself further up the leaderboard.  Is there anything in particular you are looking to address to make that happen?I.K. KIM: I think I'm going to go eat lunch now, but hopefully I think the weather is going to be nice.  So I hope it's going to dry out a little bit more when we play tomorrow and, yeah, I'm just happy to be here
