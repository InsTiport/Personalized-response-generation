 Q.  Started off really hot out there, cooled off at the end, but how do you feel right now after your round?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I feel pretty good. I think I've done what I could have done. The weather wasn't very friendly today, so maybe the mind-set that I was playing quite conservative, but I hit some good shots on the front nine.   
Yeah, had some good lag putts. It's been tricky, especially on the back nine.   
 Q.  What is tricky about the course out there for you?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Just not knowing the course that well with this condition, and there are some birdie chances out there, like No. 17. If you put yourself in a good position, I think that's the key for the week. Even the par 5s can be very tricky with the pin positions, but scores are out there, I think.   
The course is interesting. You hit hybrids into the green, and then you have kind of a chance with the short iron, as well.   
 Q.  Do you think you've set yourself up for the rest of the week so far?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Depends on the weather, but if the sun comes out, I think it will be more enjoyable.   
 Q.  Describe today's weather, if you could. It would be kind of sunny and then not, and windy and rainy.  
IN-KYUNG KIM: You know, we expected the wind, being in Busan, but I think it was better than I thought. I thought it was going to be rain all day, but we had some -- we survived it.   
 Q.  Now what do you do to get ready for tomorrow?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I think the green speeds will be different, anyway. I think I'm just going to take a break and take it easy.
