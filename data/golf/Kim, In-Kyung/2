Q. Tell me about your round out there today. What went well for you?
IN-KYUNG KIM: Just comfortable day with the weather compared to, you just don't snow what to expect. Today -- I didn't hit the ball pretty solid over the last few days. Yeah, par 5s were a little reachable today. Coming in, some of the par 4 with the downwind was quite challenging, but other than that, pleased with how I play, yeah.
Q. How important is it to take advantage of a calm day like today?
IN-KYUNG KIM: Really one shot at a time because the wind is on and off. You can't really be too tough on yourself. Obviously it's just a little bit of timing, as well.
Q. Just a couple of events left in the season. How do you assess your year?
IN-KYUNG KIM: That's a big question, and I think I've answered before. But I think this year, being not able to play most tournaments that I wanted to play was a bit difficult, but I'm happy to be here and I have a few more tournaments left, so I look forward to that, yeah.
