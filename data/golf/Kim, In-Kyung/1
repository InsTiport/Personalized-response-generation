 Q.  Pretty long day out there.  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, it's been a long day. We waited quite a bit on the course, but yeah, sunny, no rain, so it's great.   
 Q.  You played really well, 12-under, but Nelly Korda was quite flawless, and that's slightly disheartening.  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I think she played really well. Once you make some putts and have the par 5s going in for her, yeah, she played really well.   
 Q.  Your game, we never stop talking about how phenomenal you are around the greens. Your confidence level and your short game must be extraordinary, because it's quite brilliant?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you. I worked on it, and finally it's clicking a little bit better. I feel like I'm adjusting, making better choices around here. But yeah, I'm very pleased with how I chipped.
