 Q.  Great round today,66.  What made the difference there today?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I think I hit the ball really well today.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities.  But I think it just paid off, staying patient, to finish birdie on 17 and 18.   
 Q.  So were they long putts, short putts, the birdie putts?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Just tap-in, 17 and 18.  Almost tap-in on 18.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Like 11, and I thought a couple pin positions were really tough, but I was able to manage to give myself good chances.  Didn't have those -- I didn't make everything, but I felt like I gave a good go today.   
 Q.  So your iron play was more accurate today?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, I think there are a lot of good numbers in it, yeah.   
 Q.  Do you think you can win this tournament for the second time?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: You know, that's the goal, but I just wanted to play well tomorrow and go home just to my family, see my family.   
 Q.  So you're just relaxing?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Yeah, because the afternoon seems more windier.  I think I had the privilege to play without the wind.  You know, less hassle.  It's not impossible, but when it's windy, the scores can be tricky.   
 Q.  And you're not a long hitter; right?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I'm not short.  Average.   
 Q.  Is it a long hitter's course here?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I think it's not really long hitter or short hitter's course.  It's like how many putts drops, I think, kind of course.  Because it's not very slopey but there are a lot of grain into it.  I'm not sure I played with the grain the last time I was here because I heard they changed the greens a few years ago.  I think the green reading, trusting it, is tricky, but whoever trusts it, I guess.
