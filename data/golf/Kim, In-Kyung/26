Q. At what point did you know you had the lead coming down the stretch?
IN-KYUNG KIM: Last hole.  (Laughter.)
Q. That's it?
IN-KYUNG KIM: I wasn't really looking because it was so windy.  I just play my game.  And, yeah, then (indiscernible) for so many holes.
But, yeah, I was pretty nervous, yeah.
Q. Were you really?  When you found out or overall?
IN-KYUNG KIM: No, overall.  Just so windy.  Not so much about -- just keeping in play.  So, it was, yeah, tough.
Q. It was tough conditions indeed.  You haven't had your best season.  Now you're healthy.  Did something tell you you were going to have a god week coming into this week?
IN-KYUNG KIM: You know, I really prepared for this.  I really didn't expect it right away, but I knew my game was better than last year.  That's all I could really ask for.
But my trainer, my coach, they had to change so many plan for me because so much things happen from last winter.  But I just feel so good and feel all the support.  So I really appreciate all the fan out here and be able to play my game.  It's really something.
