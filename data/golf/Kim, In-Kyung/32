 Q.  So kind of up and down all day.  How did you feel overall today?  
IN KYUNG KIM: Today, well, I think I manage the round pretty well.  There was more tricky numbers I think on the front nine, but I think I had a really good birdie on 2 which helped me kind of forget about the 1st hole.  It was kind of unlucky there.   
Yeah, today I was a little bit troubling with the getting the target with the tee shot.  Maybe they moved the tee box a little bit here and there.   
But I think the managed the game well today.   
 Q.  You said you've been working on your tee balls recently, right?  
IN KYUNG KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  So maybe at the beginning it was a little off but you kind of brought it back together?  
IN KYUNG KIM: Not really off, but you know what I mean?  I could have aim other way, you know what I mean?  Wasn't really miss shot, just miss targeting.   
 Q.  Is that something you'll work on this afternoon?  
IN KYUNG KIM: No.  I think it depends on every day.  Depends on the situation where the pin is and things.   
On the back nine I got lucky.  No. 18 they move the tee like forward so I was able to come in two.  Things like that.  So it's very unexpected.  Like I cannot expect what to get here, but just give my best.  That's what I been doing.   
 Q.  Do you like chasing the lead on the final day?  
IN KYUNG KIM: I just play my game, but definitely if I play with them and you see their score and things.   
But it's their game.  I want everyone to play well.  Whoever plays best should win the tournament.
