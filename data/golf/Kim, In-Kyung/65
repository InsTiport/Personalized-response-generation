 Q.   4‑under par today, 68, just talk about your day and what went right for you?  
I.K. KIM:   I had a good start.   I almost made it on 1, and I birdied 2 and 3 and that kind of kept me going.   On 4, I didn't have a very good drive but I had a really good up‑and‑down.   
So I think I kept the momentum going, and did a lot of great things on the back nine.   The wind was changing and it was hard to adjust, but you know, yeah, it was a good day.   Everything was, you know, in the right place.   
   
 Q.   Just talk about last night, with those diamonds on, how did you feel?   
I.K. KIM:   Oh, my God, it was good.   It was something, I've never done it before, but I thought it was interesting.   It was nice to wear those glamorous jewelry, the 4 million that Suzann had.   It was a fun night.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it's important for you guys to do stuff like that to show your glamorous or fashion side?  
I.K. KIM:   Yeah, I was talking to other friends, it was on the newspaper and they said like LPGA got glamorous, and then they got dirty.   And I'm like, we didn't get any ‑‑ dirty.   I thought it was a really fun night and I think a lot of people enjoyed it, so that's good.
