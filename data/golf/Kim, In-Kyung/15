 Q.  In-Kyung Kim, 69.  How would you describe the round?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: How would I describe the round?  Actually I made couple birdie on par-5 so I was very happy.   
Well, I think maybe I wasn't best today on the fairways and things like that, but I think I managed well with what I had today.   
 Q.  Yeah, you've played well here in the past.  Almost won here back in 2013.  What have you learned from those experiences that can help you here this week?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Well, thanks for reminding me.  (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Not to bring up a bad memory.  
IN-KYUNG KIM: No, it's great memory.  It's the best I ever finish here.   
Yeah, I feel pretty good.  I'm happy with how I'm playing.  There is always I can improve, but I think I came forward away from where I began this season.   
So I'm excited for the weekend.   
 Q.  When you see how low Cristie Kerr went today pulling away from the field, does that change your plan at all heading into the weekend trying to catch her?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: What did she do today?   
 Q.  She shot a 64.  She was leading by five when you started your round; you're currently four back.  
IN-KYUNG KIM: Great.  That's great score on this golf course.  I'm sure she made some putts today.  In the morning, right?  Yeah.
