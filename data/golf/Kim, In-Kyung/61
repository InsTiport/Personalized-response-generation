Q.   Pretty good round today.   3‑under par.   You had it to 4, back to 3.   How did it feel? 
I.K. KIM:   It's nice to be back in Evian.   I had a good rest last two weeks, and I'm really excited to come back and play some good golf.
You know, the golf course have been changed a little bit.   There is few holes, few par‑3s, and you know, just they make it a little bit longer, I guess.   But, you know, if you play well you can shoot some low scores here. 
I had a good day.   It could have been lower, but I'm happy with where I'm at.

Q.   What did do for the two weeks off?   Practice?   Vacation?
I.K. KIM:   I had two weeks off, so I did a little bit everything:   rest, worked out, eat some good food, and hang out with friends.   Getting ready for this week.

Q.   Talk about the rest of the week.   You put yourself in a good position.   Hee Young went pretty low today, but still anybody's ballgame.   How do you feel for the next three rounds?
I.K. KIM:   I feel really comfortable.   I just want to keep my good attitude.   You know here you got to hit a lot of good, solid shots and still make some putts.
Yeah, like you said, you never know what's going to happen.   You just got to keep playing your own game and see what happens.
