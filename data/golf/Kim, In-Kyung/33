 Q.  Win couple weeks back.  Sixth at Evian.  What's the key to your game at the moment?  
IN KYUNG KIM: Well, I've been hitting the ball really well and I drove the ball really solid this week.  I feel like at Evian Masters driving wasn't very comfortable.   
Maybe it's wider here.  Maybe that's why.  But I feel really good with my game.   
 Q.  It's important to hit the fairways here, and putting as well.  Your putter was on fire today.  Have you been working on that at the moment?  
IN KYUNG KIM: Yes, I been working on it, and my good friend actually helped me with few tips here and there this week.   
So I think that's helping out.   
 Q.  Going into the weekend, do you think you have another 64 in you?  
IN KYUNG KIM: You know what?  Like if I can play like today I feel like I have a lot of opportunities out there.  Yeah, I had a lot of good read as well and a little bit of luck maybe.
