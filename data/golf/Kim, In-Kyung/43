Q.   Obviously not the best round today, but still feel like you're in it? 
I.K. KIM:   Yeah.

Q.   Take me through your round.   What was going on out there?   I know you're probably not too pleased with it.   What was the struggle?
I.K. KIM:   Just didn't make putts.   I hit a lot of good tee shots.   Nothing different.   Just it was hard to adjust to the wind today. 
And greens were firm, and a lot of pins were on the front, so I miss‑adjusted, and I had a lot of downhill putts, so even though it was close, it was hard to adjust, like you know, I couldn't be aggressive with.

Q.   Only one back, though.   You'd probably take that headed into the week, wouldn't you?
I.K. KIM:   Yeah.   I don't really think about‑‑ I mean I guess it was a tough round in the afternoon.   So I still have a chance, but I just don't really happy with how I kind of scored today. 

Q.   Will you watch the leaderboard at all?
I.K. KIM:   I have no idea.   Definitely, because it's out there. 

Q.   It's kind of hard to avoid at times.   What is the number in mind?   Do you have a number in mind of what it might take for tomorrow?
I.K. KIM:   No, I don't.   I just want to rest.   I just feel tired.
