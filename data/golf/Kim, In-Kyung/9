Q. How important, given the loss this morning, to come back out and set the tone with such an early lead in the afternoon?
IK KIM: I think even first round, it wasn't even the condition of myself, but the course management was a little bit difficult, and that's why on the second round I would like to focus on where I wanted to be instead of working on my swing or anything.  I just wanted to be clear with where I wanted to position myself.
Q. Sung hundred, you struggled a little this morning.  How important was it to come out this afternoon and really play well after the morning round?
SUNG HYUN PARK: So I think this morning in the first round today, I felt myself getting really down, and that was actually one of the reasons perhaps we didn't do better.  But I think in the second round today, In-Kyung was telling me just to be more comfortable, just to be myself, and I think that made me feel a lot more comfortable, and In-Kyung also had some really good shots in there, and that really supported the team in the second round.
Q. So she picked you up for the afternoon, kind of boosted your confidence do you think?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Yes.
Q. And how difficult is it when you break up a round like this to keep that momentum going?
SUNG HYUN PARK: Actually I think it's a good thing.  I think we're both quite exhausted, and it was getting a bit dark and it was getting difficult to read the putts, so I think breaking now is actually good for us.
