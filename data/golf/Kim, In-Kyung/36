Q. 2-under a round today, what was the key to solid play?
IN-KYUNG KIM: I hit a lot of fairways.  I think I missed one, like off fairway.  But I hit the ball really well.  I had a lot of chances.  I gave a lot of chances.  And I played the par 5 the way I wanted to play.  You know, there's a few excuse me putts, and there's putts that I left out there.
But like I said, it's such a great golf course, I think they did a great job.  And I don't think I play any better golf this year.
Q. What do you think about Sahalee?  How does it suit your game?
IN-KYUNG KIM: What do you think?  It's perfect.  It's like you have to have a game, otherwise you have no chance playing.
Q. And then you recently, unlike all the other PGA stuff, you went back to your full Korean name, instead of IK.  Is there reason behind that?
IN-KYUNG KIM: That's my name.  And I just change it because other people couldn't pronounce my name.  But I just want to -- yeah, have my name, not a nickname.  You can still call me IK.
Q. Good playing out there.
IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you.
