 Q.  It was exceptionally close today.  How close were you to getting the title here for the second time?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: You know, just getting myself in contention on the back nine, that was my goal.  I was able to get to the playoff.  I think that was the best scenario that I could ever ask before teeing off.  I'm sure that a lot of girls played well today, and we all have a similar story.  The course was set up for more aggressive play, but I think I take good advantage of it.   
Yeah, Angel, birdie, birdie.   
 Q.  So not too disappointed?  
IN-KYUNG KIM: I'm definitely disappointed.  I felt like I gave -- but the thing is I gave it my best, so that's all I could ask.
