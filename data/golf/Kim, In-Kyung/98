  Q. Tell us about your round today.  
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yesterday, on the front nine it was kind of strong wind, kind of. But today I played very solid all day. Yeah, I hit the ball very good.  
  
  Q. What were some key holes for you? Anything that kind of kept you going, any special holes?   
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Actually, I really have to stay focused on every hole and every shot. I mean, if you hit a good drive, you have a chance to make birdie.   
 But there's a lot of tricks on the golf course, so I really try to pay attention on every shot and hole by hole.   
  
  Q. Are you enjoying the tournament?   
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Yes, I am enjoying it, yes.  
  
  Q. What are you looking forward to the most this weekend?   
 IN-KYUNG KIM: Oh, this weekend, I wish I can play well until the end of the round on Sunday. And I very look forward to it.
