Q. How was your day?
IN-KYUNG KIM: It was similar.  It wasn't easy yesterday, either.  But a couple of holes it rained really hard.  But it was tough out there today.
Q. You're in a really good position moving into the weekend.  What's the best part of your game so far the first two rounds?
IN-KYUNG KIM: I got it up and down, like on 18, this morning and afternoon.  I played -- it played like a par 5.  There's no easy hole out here.
Q. When the conditions are like this and the golf course is the way it is, how difficult is it on patience?
IN-KYUNG KIM: You don't need your patience out here, you've just got to give your everything because there's no routine hole out here, like any other tournament.
But I really enjoy the golf course.  It's so nice.  And even though it rained, you still have to play the solid position.  I couldn't really fire at the flag.  It's going to be a challenge.
Q. What's your game plan for the next couple of rounds?
IN-KYUNG KIM: Just fairways and greens.  And got to make some good lag putts.  A lot depends on the weather, too.
