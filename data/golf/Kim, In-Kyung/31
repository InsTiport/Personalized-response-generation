Q. First win in six years on the LPGA.  How does it feel to be back?
IN KYUNG KIM: I really don't know.  I just wanted to play my game.  I can't control anyone else's game.
I feel good that I was able to play how I wanted to play, you know?  Even the result, I really try not to focus on result so much.  Then I wouldn't be able to perform the way I wanted.
I chose to play my game and kind of paid off, I guess.  Really didn't aim to win it.  But actually, I mean, who knows?  I can control my game.  I can't control anyone else's game.
Q. Looking back at 16, the eagle, did you realize how big that was at the time?
IN KYUNG KIM: I think the 15 was really big, too.  I wasn't sure go for it or not go for it.  I felt like today I really played with everything I got.  I didn't really pull back.  Even No. 9 I felt was right club.
So, yeah, I think I managed.  I played aggressively, which I had to on this golf course.  And especially back nine I knew that everybody was going to score, so I wanted to do the same thing.
But the thing is I can't really control the result but I give my best.
