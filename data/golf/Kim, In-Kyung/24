COLIN CALLANDER: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  We have In-Kyung Kim, she just shot a 68 for an 11-under par total and is currently leading.  Congratulations.
IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you.
COLIN CALLANDER: You must be delighted to score, particularly with how bad the weather was.
IN-KYUNG KIM: I really didn't know what I was shooting to be honest with you.  I just wanted to play at my own time because it was really hard -- especially on last four or five holes, when it kind of poured down.  But we were a little behind, so I just had to play, move forward.
COLIN CALLANDER: Is that the worst rain you've played in, over the last few holes.
IN-KYUNG KIM: Maybe Liverpool like a few years ago.  Played 36.  Maybe that was the worst that I think I've ever played in.
COLIN CALLANDER: The eagle at the 11th, could you tell us how you did that.
IN-KYUNG KIM: Well, very unexpected, really.  Hit the driver as well as I could, and I think hit the downslope I guess.  It went down all the way.  I had 206 front and downhill lie, so I hit 5-wood and just dribbled kind of on the green.  Was able to hit it to the hole, you know.  Sometimes it was quite short a few times actually but that one went right in the middle.  So it was quite rewarding.
Q. You're having a pretty good season this year.  What do you put that down to?
IN-KYUNG KIM: I wish I know the reason, but I think just been consistently -- consistent shot-making I think.  I've been hitting the ball very well and then starting to make some putts.  I think that's when I shoot low scores.  So I think that's the reason.
Q. Were you on the clock out there?
IN-KYUNG KIM: No, we're not on the clock.  We were just warned because we were a little behind.  But it was the last few holes that got really tough and yeah, I think everybody had some struggles.
Q. Trying to get in out of the rain?
IN-KYUNG KIM: Oh, yes.  Can you hear it?  I thought we could not finish.  The last pin, we kind of go for it.
COLIN CALLANDER: Thank you for coming in.
IN-KYUNG KIM: Thank you.  Have a good night.
