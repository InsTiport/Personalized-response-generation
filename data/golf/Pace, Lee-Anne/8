 Q.  Good playing.  Two good days so far.  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Been in kind of different conditions, like wind yesterday and the rain also.  Feel like you have been around long enough and played in that enough you're comfortable no matter what the case may be?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: I mean, yeah, you have to be really patient today, especially the front nine.  It was really, really wet.  Yeah, we stayed patient.  Played the par-5s nicely.   
Yeah, just stayed patient for a change.   
 Q.  Has that been the key for you so far?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: I think in wind you really just have to work it out well nicely.  There will be a few mistakes out there.  You have to accept it.   
This week I've about an bit better with that.   
 Q.  Anything in particular with your game that's working really well?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: My drive and my iron play is really good this week.  Then if you (indiscernible) you make a couple putts.   
Yeah, just hitting a lot of greens, I think.   
 Q.  Is that the plan moving forward, fairways and greens?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah, I think the wind is pretty consistent here every day, so just the same game plan.  Yeah, maybe we can get to the top.
