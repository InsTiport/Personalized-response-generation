 Q.  4-under, 68.  How does it feel to post that on a first day?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Pretty good.  Actually got it going fairly early, so I was hoping for a bit more.   
Yeah, didn't get it, but pretty happy.  No bogeys, so that's good.   
 Q.  How does this course set up for you this week and what's the condition?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Oh, the condition is fantastic.  I absolutely love this place.  This tournament is awesome.   
But, yeah, the course is great.  I love this type of golf anyway.  You have to kind of shape it into the greens.  The greens are firming up, so it'll be interesting.   
 Q.  You had a top 10 here last year.  Do you feel like this is a place you can win?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah, I definitely feel so.  I feel like that.  I've been working quite hard on my putting as well.  I just changed my putter this week, and that seems to be working as well.   
 Q.  What putter did you switch to?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: The Odyssey 2-Ball and it's red.  It's awesome.  It's so beautiful.  I love it.  When I look at it I'm just like, Ah, I'm in love.   
 Q.  Was that your first tournament round with it?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yes, yeah.  I saw it Tuesday and I just loved it.  It's perfect.   
 Q.  Anything you're going to do differently tomorrow?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: No.  Just going to practice, a lot of putting this afternoon.  Yeah, same thing.
