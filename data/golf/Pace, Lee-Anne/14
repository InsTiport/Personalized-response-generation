Q. Best memory from last year?
LEE-ANNE PACE: Winning.
Q. Holding the trophy; was that it?
LEE-ANNE PACE: Holding the trophy.
Q. Biggest difference coming in as defending champ?
LEE-ANNE PACE: Evolving as a player, just getting used to -- is that what you mean?
Q. Yeah, like any perks, anything different coming in?
LEE-ANNE PACE: Oh, yeah, the room, yeah.  I've got a suite this week, which is just amazing.  I've never stayed in a room like that, which is really cool.
Q. And pictures on the posters, face everywhere.  You've done that on the LET enough, so you're used to seeing that.
LEE-ANNE PACE: But it's special because it's the LPGA.
Q. And your sister is here?
LEE-ANNE PACE: My sister is right there.
Q. Does she travel with you ever?
LEE-ANNE PACE: Not really.  She comes out maybe once every two weeks, but she knows everything about golf, so she's a bit nervous.  She's like, I hate your job because it's too nerve-racking.  But yeah, it's nice to have that -- we've been doing some things outside.  It's just really relaxing.
Q. This is probably the week to bring her.
LEE-ANNE PACE: I'm very happy that she's here, yeah, exactly.
Q. What did you guys do last night, activities?
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah.  I woke up with a smile this morning, had coffee in bed and laughed, and it was just so relaxing.  I really honestly feel like I'm on holiday, which is cool, when you're playing golf.
Q. What's her name?
LEE-ANNE PACE: Simone.  Last night we just explored the resort, and I think today we're going to the spa and to the beach.
