 Q.  1-under, 5-under total, happy with it?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah, I'm happy.  It's one of those, I finished with two bogeys in my last four, which isn't ideal but maybe I'm in for next week.  Hitting it well and putting it well, and happy about links golf.   
 Q.  Was that going through your mind when you were out there?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah, I was pretty relaxed about it.  I think I was about three for four shots ahead of the others and I was playing well and I was in control.  So I didn't really think about that.  I was more chasing the top 5 spots.   
 Q.  How would this be in terms of preparation for a major on a links course next week?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Great preparation.  Just carry on doing what you're doing.  Next week is a really tough course, especially if the wind gets up.  It's not supposed to be as good weather of this week, so I think it will be more of a challenge.   
 Q.  You and haven't played Royal Lytham before?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: I did.  It's the anniversary of my first British Open.   
 Q.  Will you change your mind-set going into next week being it's a major or anything?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: No.  It's the same.  We're playing against the same girls, a couple more from the LPGA but it's the same.   
 Q.  Feeling very good about your game next week?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Very good, putting nicely.  Just love links golf, hit it low enough.
