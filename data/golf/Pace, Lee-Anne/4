 Q.  Happy with 3-under today?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah, I played solid.  Didn't make a lot of mistakes.  I think only really one way ward drive which cost me a bogey, but that's links golf.   
 Q.  Plenty of motivation after watching Brandon Stone win here two weeks ago?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah, what an incredible round he had.  Yeah, another good round by a South African hopefully will be good.   
 Q.  Do you think you can follow that up with another South African victory?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: What did he shoot the last day, 60?  The course is playing lovely.  I actually love it.  It's nice being here.   
 Q.  Have you been here before?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah, for the Scottish before when it was the LET.   
 Q.  You like links?  
LEE-ANNE PACE: I do.  I love links.
