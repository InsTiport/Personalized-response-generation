LEE-ANNE PACE: Actually today played a lot easier.  There was almost no wind; maybe three, four meters.  Only the last hole it started raining, so pretty good timing.
Q. Yeah, the rain has really started to become a factor in these closing few holes.  The weather forecast for tomorrow isn't great.  How does that affect your game plan?
LEE-ANNE PACE: It's the same for everybody, so just stay patient and try and hit the fairways and the greens and roll in a couple putts.
Q. You won The Blue Bay LPGA a couple of years ago.  It was a marathon of a tournament because of the weather.  You do seem to play well when it gets tough out there.
LEE-ANNE PACE: I think you just focus a little bit more because you know not one shot is easy out there when it's that way.  I guess playing in Europe for nine years helped a little bit.
Q. The front nine you seemed to play particularly well.
LEE-ANNE PACE: Yeah, I do.  The back nine, I don't know what's going on there, but certainly go for a few more birdies there tomorrow.
