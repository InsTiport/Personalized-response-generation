RHONDA GLENN:  What a round, 67.  You started on the back 9, you had a double on No. 12.  Tell me about that hole first.
 PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:  I played a great shot, it bounced out back of the green, and that was not a good place to go.  I said, "That's starting very well today".  The green got firmer.  That was not a good start.  But I just kept going.  The next hole I made a birdie and a couple holes later I just did another one.  So it was very -- I was relaxed so a [] double over here might happen very quickly.  So you know what it is on the U.S. Open.  You know you're going to make some bad shots sometimes.  So it's okay.
RHONDA GLENN:  You made six birdies after that, no more bogeys.  Tell us about the clubs you hit into the green and the length of your putts on the birdies, beginning with No. 13.
 PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:   13 was a par-5.  I was just on the edge of the green, I chipped behind the hole and I was -- if you don't mind I'm going to speak in meters, because I don't know about feet.  So I was two meters behind the pin, and made the putt.

15, I made a great 8-iron punch shot under the branches there and I just left it a meter from the hole.  So that was -- with a lot of break on it, but I made it.

And then -- yeah, actually I had -- I played very well today.  I had a lot of opportunities, and before I started that big roll, I had two long putts that just stayed short on line, short of the hole.  And I felt it's okay, it's coming.  The visualization of the putt, the setup in front of it, the routine was so much better.  It was so good.  I said to my caddy, it's short, on line, but it's so much better, it's going to come.  And not long after that I just -- it came.  And I just dropped the putts straight in the hole.
RHONDA GLENN:  No. 6 what did you hit to the green?
 PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:  8-iron.
RHONDA GLENN:  How long was that putt?
 PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:  I was that short from the hole (indicating), I was very close, not even a meter.
RHONDA GLENN:  7?
PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:  That was the long one, started with -- I was maybe 7 meters from the hole.  Just short on line.  So -- and the next -- with a 3-iron.

And then No. 8 I played a -- a 7-iron shot.  And I was pretty far this one, too.  I was maybe 8 meters from the hole.  And I dropped that, too.

9, I was pretty close.  I was two meters from the hole.
RHONDA GLENN:  What did you hit?
 PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:  A sand wedge shot.
RHONDA GLENN:  The club on No. 8?
 PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:  7-iron.
RHONDA GLENN:  Now we're going to take you down to the media room.

Q.  How often have you been this close in -- at this point in a major tournament?
 PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:  I won the Nabisco last year, so I've been this close last year.  And the British Open last year, too.  I was leading the last day.

Q.  So you're very comfortable where you are?
 PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:  Yeah, I know what it is.  And today, I mean it's the first day of a U.S. Open.  So right now today is a very comfortable position, because there's three more days to come, and everything can happen.  So I'm just happy to be here and playing good golf after -- I mean just coming back playing a few months ago.  So it's great.  I'm just having fun right now.  Thank you.
