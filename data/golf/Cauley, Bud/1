Q. A solid 6-under, 65. Take us through that stretch you're 1-under but you go birdie 17, 18 and then 2 and 3. That really got you rolling.
BUD CAULEY: Yeah, I was playing pretty solid before that, just kind of missed a couple putts, really, I guess. And then, yeah, to birdie 17. I hit a pretty great drive down there, great up-and-down. Three good shots on 18. And then probably the best shot I've hit in a while on 2. I was in that fairway bunker under the tree and was able to just get it over the lip, under the tree. It was a great shot, kind of lucky too to get up close and make that one. And then a great 2-putt on 3. So all in all played solid.
Q. You made the sand save at 5, which was great because you still had a fairly long par putt there. And then at 7 you were over the green, made a nice up-and-down there too.
BUD CAULEY: Yeah, the one on 7 kind of fooled me. I hit a pretty good shot in there, came out a little bit lower than I wanted, but just kind of landed just past the hole and rolled to the back there.
And then that chip, I don't know what I was looking at, I never saw it going that far left. But it did, it wasn't a very good chip, but a nice putt there. And I was able to do that today, when I had those par putts I was able to make them to kind of keep my round going.
Q. The guys this morning were raving about the greens, the speed and how good they are. Did that continue this afternoon for you?
BUD CAULEY: Yeah, they were perfect. I don't know what critique you could make of them, they're fast, firm, rolling true. So if you get it started on a good line and you get it to the hole it's got a pretty good chance of going in.
