 Q.  You had looks at 7 and 8 for birdie.  
BUD CAULEY: Yeah, yeah, I let a couple of slip away on 7 and 8.  I holed my fair share, also.  You want to make them all, but I couldn't be too disappointed with that.  If I can just keep giving myself a lot of looks like that, we should be in good shape.   
 Q.  Your thoughts on how different this golf course IS for this major as compared to what it's been for a regular tour stop?  
BUD CAULEY: We kind of joked about it today.  It's amazing how much more difficult you can make a place when you suck the moisture out of the greens.  We come here at the Wells Fargo, it's softer and more scorable.  I was surprised how much it dried out.  Even still you are back there further than normal and going into greens that are still pretty firm.  So it's a good test.
