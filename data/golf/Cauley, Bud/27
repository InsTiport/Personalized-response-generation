 Q.   Conditions were really tough yesterday; did you feel like you knew birdies were out there for the taking, a bit of a relief after Saturday?  
BUD CAULEY:   I don't know, even if I thought, that I wouldn't let myself‑‑ but the course played really tough all week.   Obviously going out in the morning, it would be a little bit softer, a little bit easier to go, so that's what I tried to do.  
   
 Q.   And the FedExCup security, you're a lock now through the BMW Championship.   As a rookie on Tour, how good does it feel to have that kind of security?   
BUD CAULEY:   It's great, nice to be able to play the next couple of weeks, but obviously the big goal is to get in THE TOUR Championship.
