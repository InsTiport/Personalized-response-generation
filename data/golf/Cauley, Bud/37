 Q.   Bud, tell us about the golf course.   
BUD CAULEY:   Yeah, you know, it was there for the taking early.   I wasn't able to hit the shots I wanted, so I kind of got off to a slow start but then made some birdies kind of in the middle and towards the end.   When the wind started to pick up it started to play a little firmer and faster.  
   
 Q.   You were able to take advantage of a downwind hole on 9, just hit a short iron?  
BUD CAULEY:   Yeah, 9‑iron in.   I was a little disappointed I couldn't get a little bit closer and have a better chance at 3, but I was happy to make birdie.   
   
 Q.   You're 6‑under at the halfway mark.   What were your expectations coming in here?  
BUD CAULEY:   You know, I've been playing well.   I've been working hard trying to get my game in shape.   I expected to come out and play well.   There are a couple things I need to go work on, but I'll try and get that done.  
   
 Q.   How many holes were you able to play before the wind came up?  
BUD CAULEY:   We probably played about five or six holes.  
   
 Q.   Was the wind a little harder than it was in the opening round?  
BUD CAULEY:   To be honest with you, I think it's about the same, maybe a little bit different.   But you know, it's always easier playing in the morning.   You get out there and maybe it started blowing 6th or 7th hole but it didn't really pick up until like 9.  
   
 Q.   I know you were frustrated with some of your wedge shots in the opening round.   Did that improve?  
BUD CAULEY:   Yeah, it did a little bit, but I still need to work on some chipping and work on a little putting.
