Q. Bud, 66 today.  10-under for the tournament.  Your thoughts on how it went out there.
BUD CAULEY: Yeah, played really well.  Drove it well.  Irons were good and putted pretty well.  Pretty happy with everything today.
Q. It's amazing you see some 29s and 30s out there as you make the turn.  There seems to be a difference between the front and back-9s.  Some of the pin placements on the back look like they're pretty interesting.
BUD CAULEY: They tucked them away on a few holes.  Really just makes it important to hit the fairway.  If you're in the fairway they're still soft enough where you can get at some of them.  You're in the rough, it's pretty tough.
Q. Size up tomorrow.  You came in here 143rd.  Now you're 131st.  You certainly have a good opportunity to get in the Playoffs.
BUD CAULEY: Keep doing what I'm doing.  I played really well today.  Only two mistakes I made was 18 and 9.  I was in the first cut.  Got a flyer on 9 and making bogey.  I was kind of worried about getting one on 18 and didn't make a good swing there.  Keep playing the way I'm playing, I'll be fine.
Q. Well done today.  Good luck tomorrow.
BUD CAULEY: Thanks a lot.
