Q.   Can you talk about your first PGA TOUR official round? 
BUD CAULEY:   Yeah, I played well.   I drove the ball well, hit it pretty well all day.   Got some putts to fall in the middle of my round.   Didn't finish the way I would like but a lot of positives going into tomorrow. 
It really felt the same.   Just get out there and not really thinking about what tournament it is or your status.   Just going out there and trying to play the best I can.

Q.   How has the reception been from your fellow professionals?
BUD CAULEY:   Everybody has been really nice.   I've tried to introduce myself to as many guys as I can, but some guys have come up to me and told me good playing, and it's made me feel very welcome.

Q.   No intimidation factor?
BUD CAULEY:   No.   Great group of guys out here and they have been very nice.

Q.   Talk about numbers 9 through 12, nice little stretch. 
BUD CAULEY:   Didn't play 9 as well as I had hoped but a great up‑and‑down from the back of the green.
And the next three holes, 11, it was nice to make a long one from about 35 feet‑‑ or on 10; thought I might sneak one in there for two but just missed.   12, I hit a good wedge in there.   That was a lot of fun.

Q.   Conditions out there this afternoon, how were they? 
BUD CAULEY:   The wind picked up.   It was a different wind than we played in the practice round, so I was trying to adjust on some of those holes. 

Q.   What was it like on the first tee?   Was it nervous at all?   I know you've played a lot of tournaments already. 
BUD CAULEY:   I always get excited, a little nervous right before a round no matter what it is.
