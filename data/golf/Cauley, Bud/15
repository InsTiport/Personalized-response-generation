Q. Projected to make it on money.  What was the mentality going in the final round knowing where you were at?
BUD CAULEY: I was trying to make birdies.  I was playing well.  So I knew if I kept going out there and putting the balling in the fairway I would give myself some chances.  I drove it pretty well today.  I didn't hit my irons as well as I'd like.  Just have to wait and see how these guys finish up and where that puts me.
Q. Big picture, how will that free you up, assuming you get enough money going forward?
BUD CAULEY: It would be great.  These last couple years have been pretty strange just with getting hurt and coming back and only getting to play kind of every now and again with my medical.  So, it would be great to be able to get full status back and pick a schedule going into next year.
Q. It's a good situation but it's got to be kind of awkward for the next few years.  You're not in the  Playoffs and not be able to a play on the Web.  It's a forced break.
BUD CAULEY: I'm disappointed I couldn't play a little better today and get into the Playoff events.  I feel like I'm playing well and, like you said, I don't want to go home and watch on TV.  I did plenty of that when I was hurt.  I'm over that.
Yeah.  So if that's the case, you know, definitely a positive I can get my full status back and work on my game and be ready for next year.
