 Q.   Talk about your round today and what went well for you.   
BUD CAULEY:   I drove it pretty well, I got it in the fairway.   I hit some good iron shots, hit some terrible ones.   
I got up‑and‑down quite a bit today, managed some good par saves, so that's what kept me in there.  
   
 Q.   Being a rookie, first time out here, I'm sure you've seen the history here that you got to take it low.   Did you come in with that mentality of just take it as low as possible?  
BUD CAULEY:   Yeah, you know you have to go out and make birdies.   I put it in the fairway, gave myself some good chances, didn't hit it as good as I could, and hope I can do a little better tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Did you go to Q‑School?  
BUD CAULEY:   No.   
   
 Q.   How does that feel when you're playing here and knowing that you didn't go to Q‑School and a lot of other guys did.   
BUD CAULEY:   Out here in a tournament everyone starts from square.   
   
 Q.   What was your favorite shot of the day?  
BUD CAULEY:   I made a bunker shot on the back nine, I think 12.   
Hit it in there and holed it out of the bunker.   So that was pretty nice.   
   
 Q.   Any thoughts going into tomorrow?   The courses over there, any of them catch your eye?  
BUD CAULEY:   No, I like both of them.   I just need to keep on hitting it off the tee the way I did and just keep working on the irons.   
   
 Q.   Do you think it's an advantage to have played this course today?  
BUD CAULEY:   This one is a little bit narrower, but they're all difficult in their own way.
