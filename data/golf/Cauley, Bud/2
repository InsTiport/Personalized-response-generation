 Q.  Bogey-free round on the Nicklaus Course. You were telling me how much nicer it is to play here with the weather compared to last week in Hawaii. How were you able to take advantage of scoring conditions?  
BUD CAULEY: I started off, I drove the ball well, which was nice. Hit a lot of good iron shots and holed a few putts, had a long one for eagle there on 7 or whichever hole it was, so that's always kind of a bonus. So yeah, all in all it was a real solid day.   
 Q.  The past couple of years it's like been you've been through heck and back with all kinds of things off the course, the knee surgery in the fall. What has this past couple of years been like for you and getting back on track?  
BUD CAULEY: Unfortunately, it's been too many visits to the hospital, but I feel good now. That's really been kind of a goal of mine. It's kind of funny, just maybe make it a couple years and not have to have surgery. So I'm doing everything I can to stay healthy and be out here and playing golf, which is what I love to do.
