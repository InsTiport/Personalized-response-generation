 Q.  Hard-fought match, a match that you were never trailing.  Let's go back to the 18th tee shot, 1-up.  Can you talk us through that shot?  
KAYLEE BENTON: Yeah, you know, I hadn't played that hole since stroke play, so it was a little bit different.  I just took the same line, and I felt good over it, just felt a little open, but I just swung, hit it good, went a little left, hit the tree.  It's okay.   
 Q.  What was your initial thought now getting ready to hit your fourth shot from the fairway after seeing Kristen hit it in the hazard left?  
KAYLEE BENTON: Well, I knew going back to the tee that I was going to need to make bogey, so I knew I was going to have to birdie with my second ball.  When I saw her go left, I was like, well, I didn't expect that for sure.  So I just kind of saw an opening and tried to hit a good one, and I did.   
 Q.  You played great all week long; going forward, what do you take from this experience?  
KAYLEE BENTON: You know, I just -- I don't know, I just feel like I can play here, and learned a lot about myself and how I handle pressure.  An unfortunate end, but I still feel like I handled myself well this week.  Yeah, good week.   
 Q.  When will you be heading back to school at Arkansas?  
KAYLEE BENTON: Right now.
