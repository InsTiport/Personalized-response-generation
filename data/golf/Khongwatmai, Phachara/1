Q. How would you rate your opening 3-under in your first WGC event?
PHACHARA KHONGWATMAI: I'm very happy with 3-under today.  Today I'm putting so bad but I hit driver so good, and missed a lot of birdies.  But I not make bogey too much and can make 3-under today.
Q. Your parents are here with you this week.  Did they give you great motivation?
PHACHARA KHONGWATMAI: Yeah, I'm very happy with this round.
Q. This event, some of the world's best players, including yourself, you must be pretty excited?
PHACHARA KHONGWATMAI: Exciting for me because I play with superstar already, and I just play my game, and today, I'm very happy with 3-under.
Q. What do you think you need to do to move further up?
PHACHARA KHONGWATMAI: I don't think anything.  Just my plan is just hit in the fairways and hit to the green and only this one, if I'm putting so good, maybe come out many under.
