 Q.  How do you hit shots like that under that sort of pressure?  How did you do today? 
 SHERRI STEINHAUER:  I played really well.  I shot 1-under par, and she shot even par today, so it was just great golf match.  She is such a nice person, just I thoroughly enjoyed that match this week. 

 Q.  One point, is that right?  Overall, do you feel the support from the American fans? 
 SHERRI STEINHAUER:  Absolutely.  Absolutely. 

 Q.  Take it to America? 
 SHERRI STEINHAUER:  It's the first time I've taken a look.  Actually, I did not watch the leaderboard all day, so it's looking good. 

 Q.  Good luck and great on your half point. 
 SHERRI STEINHAUER:  Thanks.
