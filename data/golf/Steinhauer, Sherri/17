 Q.  Winning 5-up, nice to start off not having to play a full 18? 
 SHERRI STEINHAUER:  Yeah, it was nice to get off to a good start and get up and kind of stay up the whole time.  I just prayed real consistent today.  Really only made one bogey and she birdied the hole.  So just played real steady and it was a good day. 

 Q.  So you had a great weekend, are you feeling confident with your game right now? 
 SHERRI STEINHAUER:  Yeah, I feel good about my game.  Just, you know, match play is completely different, so it's been a long time since I've played, it but I have been on three Solheim Cups.  Unfortunately I lost early last year here, but you know, it's a different type of strategy.  So I really enjoy it. 

 Q.  Looking forward to tomorrow?  You'll be playing Ai. 
 SHERRI STEINHAUER:  Yeah, Ai is a very, very nice person, great player.  So it's going to be a tough one.
