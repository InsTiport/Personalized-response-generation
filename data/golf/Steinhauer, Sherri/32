SHERRI STEINHAUER:  I played Dale Reid today  and I got off to a really good start.  I turned it 2  under and was 4 up through through 10 holes and played  really, really well up to that point and I think at  that point I relaxed a little bit and didn't play as  well as I would like to coming in.  Took me to the 18th  hole to beat her, but that kind of goes with the week  since I went to the 18TH hole the last two days, so i  think I was THE only player to do that.  But I got my  fun fill of Solheim Cup and thoroughly enjoyed the  week.
