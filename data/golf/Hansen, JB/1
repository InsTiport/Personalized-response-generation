 Q.  A 68, safe to say, a dramatic final day. Can you describe the action for us?  
JB HANSEN: Back nine got excited. Really got to feel how it is to play for a European Tour tournament inside me. The screw-up on 17, unfortunate, cost me a chance this week unfortunately. Disappointed now but also really proud of my game today.   
 Q.  Aside from the 17th, you must be extremely proud of the way you came back from five shots at the start of the day to battle yourself right in contention. How much is the mental side an aspect of that?  
JB HANSEN: A lot. I mean, I've been playing well for three weeks now, and put myself in good positions. So getting really close this week was really nice, but just also really want that win, you know.   
 Q.  Hunting that first win, and this important period of the year, as well. How important to keep it going with the rankings at the back of your mind?  
JB HANSEN: Good. I don't know what I'm moving up to now but hopefully I get in Turkey and maybe South Africa, but it's nice to get into those kind of tournaments.   
 Q.  Overall, happy with the week?  
JB HANSEN: Yeah, great week. Lovely here in France. Love the course.
