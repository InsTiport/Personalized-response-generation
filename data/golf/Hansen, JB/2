 Q.  Can we have your thoughts on that 68?  
JB HANSEN: If you gave me 68 before going out, I'd have taken it. It was tough conditions. Throw some shots away, get in trouble -- so really happy.   
 Q.  What was the key to overcoming the conditions today?  
JB HANSEN: Pretty much the same as yesterday. Keeping the ball in play. A lot of fairways and greens, just be patient out there. There are birdies, but just keep the ball in play.   
 Q.  How is your game going at the minute?  
JB HANSEN: It's nice. Just the finish of the season I really wanted. Just trying to keep doing what I'm doing and see where it ends up.   
 Q.  And the goal for the weekend, just keep playing your game?  
JB HANSEN: I'll focus on my own game and see where I am.
