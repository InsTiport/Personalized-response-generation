Q.   Thoughts on that round today and your position on that board?
JB HANSEN:   Perfect game out there, no bogeys today, seven birdies, putting fantastic.   Had a great chance all the time so really, really happy with my game.

Q.   Moving into nice position from the tee and getting plenty of opportunities?
JB HANSEN:   Hit it on the right side of the pins today.   Yesterday I hit a few‑‑ made some bogeys and a double and just missed it on the wrong side and you can't do that on this course. 

Q.   I take it you've enjoyed playing links golf? 
JB HANSEN:   Yeah, it's a great place.   I like the course. 

Q.   Do you look back to amateur days, playing with creativity?
JB HANSEN:   I haven't really played so much links.   We don't have so many links courses in Denmark.   It's only over here I've played a few times. 

Q.   But you know the strategies that are needed and the fun you can have with some of the rolls and awkward bounces? 
JB HANSEN:   Yeah, it's fun out there.   You have to really control the ball. 

Q.   How has the game been and how has the confidence been and the progress? 
JB HANSEN:   The game has been tough.   The putting has been the toughest.   The putting, I really found it this week on the course, and last week with my coach.   The game looks solid.

Q.   Was it something people are doing wrong or something that they have identified?
JB HANSEN:   I just made it a bit too technical.   Just a bit more speed and touch.
