 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
JOEY SINDELAR: It's too bad there had to be a wake up call at the far end of that.  Really, what that was -- do you already know what it was?   
 Q.  I don't.  
JOEY SINDELAR: So the whistle blew when we were in progress on number 3.  So I had hit one shot and then somehow the scoring system took that as the final number for the hole.  So it thought I was done at 1.  So I had an electronic glitch four shots in my favor -- although I did birdie the hole -- so three shots in my favor.  But, yeah, what I would really rather tell you is I hit five sprinkler heads and got two good bounces and it went in, but that's not the case.
