  Q. Joey, talk about your round, tough finish.   
 JOEY SINDELAR: I'm kind sick to my stomach right now. I didn't hit good iron shots coming in, a little too much pressure on my putter, and made a couple bogeys. But I'll just try to remember the first part of the round rather than the second part.  
  
  Q. After 12 holes, you were minus seven --  
 JOEY SINDELAR: Well, you know, you try not to get carried away too much with your emotions. But it was good.  
  
  Q. The first round and the last round, other than the last two holes, very positive for you?  
 JOEY SINDELAR: I'm very happy, thank you.
