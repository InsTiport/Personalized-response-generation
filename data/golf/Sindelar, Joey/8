   JOEY SINDELAR: Let me say before we get to me, which is not important, I think he's 66 (nodding toward Hale Irwin). That is really good. I mean, that's no charity. We're all standing here going, I hope I can even walk around this place when I'm 66. Great going. But that's him. You know, that's the dude.   
 Anyway, Calc and I had a good time out there. It was easy for me. On the first tee I said let's have a Calc day because you all know he can light it up. We never did get to the point we wanted to. Although he's not done yet, I guess. Are we nearly done? But you know, he's a good one. When you need a round in the -- when you need to see something going on in the last day, it's a good partner to be with.   
 It was a super, super golf course. We saw most of the entire golf course -- we saw virtually all of it today and finally saw a little bit of wind. You know, with a little bit firmer greens and a little bit of just typical wind, I think the leaderboard colors would have been entirely different. But it's what we had, and it was a completely fair and challenging test, and they did a great job with it. Fun, fun week. Well, fun might not be the right word, but it's what it was supposed to be, which is awesome.
