Q.  You had a great week can; you just talk about it?
JOEY SINDELAR:  It was, it was a lot of fun.  It always leaves a bad taste when you falter on the last hole, but it was a fun week, not only my play, which I was very happy with.  All portions showed up and did nicely.

But I'm so happy for Seth Waugh and Deutsche Bank and this community.  This has really become one of the wonderful, really, good, good tournaments, way above par, awesome.

All I wanted my caddie to keep me posted was where Olin was and he was at 14 and I just couldn't get over that 10 hump.  I couldn't do it, and I tried to be aggressive on 18, that's the one bad drive I hit today, and so what.  You get away with stuff and you stub your toe a few times and it all comes out in the wash.
Q.  So a short birdie putt here, you were not thinking about going for it?
JOEY SINDELAR:  That was a par putt.  I was in the hazard.  That was a bogey for me on the last hole.

I hit it in the hazard, just, and a foot either way I could have laid right up and had it, but so what.  Next week we won't care.

Just got ahead of it and leaned on it because I had to kill it to get over that trap, and I just hit my one stinker of the day and it went down the hazard, but I had a nice little par putt.  These greens are tough.  I'm sure you've heard the guys say that.  They are slick and they can be hard to read.

But most of all I just want to make sure you guys know, this is really a wonderful event.  They have done a great job here and I look forward to next time.
