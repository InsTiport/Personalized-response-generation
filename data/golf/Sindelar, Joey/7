Q.   2â€‘under today, nice round.   Tell me a little bit about how it went and the course. 
JOEY SINDELAR:   I think all of the guys are going to be thankful the wind wasn't blowing today.   Because that just allows us to get less moguls between our ball and the cup on the green. 
The greens are a lot of the story here.   When the wind's not blowing, we can be much more in control.   I think that's going to put a smile on some guys' faces today.
