  Q. You had a great finish there with a birdie on 18. How is it finishing up?  
 JOEY SINDELAR: Finishing up was good. The other part was really smelly. I just couldn't get in sync. This is an interesting course, because the fairways are very fast, which is odd. So although they look wide, you have to have the ball going the right way to keep it in the fairway and I seem to be out of round on that a little bit and I wasn't on it for the first couple of hours. After that, it seemed to get better and I made some better swings, had birdie chances and the ending was better, dinner will taste better.   
  
  Q. What do you think you'll need to do to prepare for tomorrow, knowing that you're in the hunt?  
 JOEY SINDELAR: The only proper answer and the incredibly boring answer for many of these guys is we'll do the same thing.   
 This isn't a time to change, this is, you know, if you're working on something, you continue on that journey, if you're not, you don't go find something, if you're looking for something to do you should probably go chip and putt, which is what I'm going to go do. So for me it is just more of the same.
