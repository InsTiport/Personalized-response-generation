   YANO AZUMA: It's the first time for me to play at the U.S. Open. I didn't expect anything. I wanted to pass the cut. That was my first goal. As I recognize I'm doing very well, I'm going to keep on doing it.  
  
  Q. You've had the best season on the Japan TOUR last year. What made you so successful last year?  
 YANO AZUMA: I've been playing for a long time. And I tried to change my swing and I tried to be better. And all the years I've been playing and this year I get good results.  
  
  Q. Talk about how you played today, this morning.   
 YANO AZUMA: I got two birdies, not three. Well, today, this morning it was a 3 hitters, putt. I'm going to do it. If I commit to it I'm going to do all right. I felt very good about it.   
 The next one I made the 1-putt. Made it. Felt good. About the 3-wood, that's okay. I'm doing the best play and I'm very happy about it, very successful.  
  
  Q. Now that you've made the cut, what's your goal now?  
 YANO AZUMA: Well, the green is very soft, and I'm a short hitter. But for me it's setting direction. And if it's a good direction and the short hitters, I can do a lot about putting and get good birdies, and I think even short hitters, I can do better this tournament.   
  
  Q. What would it mean to you to be the first Asian to win a major championship?  
 YANO AZUMA: Well, I have a big chance to win. I feel like that. Even though I'm Asian, I can do it. And the feeling is very good. And my luck is coming out. I believe in it. I think I have a big chance to win, be the first Asian winner, and keep on playing with this feeling.
