  CALVIN KOH:     Very exciting day, especially on the last where you just missed a birdie by just a few inches.   Tell us about your day out there today.  
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   Overall the last couple days, I feel very consistent with my game.   Even though yesterday I had a double‑bogey on the last hole, and today I started with a bogey on the first hole; but I managed to have five birdies today and unfortunately No.17 and 18, just a little miss or else I could have gone a couple more under.   
But I'm very happy about my result today.   
CALVIN KOH:   Talk about playing with Michael Campbell going into the weekend.     
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   I know Campbell quite well and we are quite good friends.   We played on The European Tour several times together.   I'm really happy to be able to play in hopefully the leading group with Cambo tomorrow.   Looking forward to the final two rounds.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned yesterday about experience coming into play at the end of the season; the top four or five players are all over 40, so how much is experience helping in the blustery conditions out there?   
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   I'm glad to see several 40‑plus players what are on the leaderboard, top of the leaderboard.   JimÃ©nez and Michael Campbell, like myself, have played at Fanling.   And on this course, you don't need a lot of power but you do need accuracy and you have to have patience and your overall game has to be on target to be able to score well.       
   
 Q.   On your first hole, your tee shot went into the rough.   
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   I had 167 yards, and I chose a 7‑iron.   Unfortunately there was no spin, so the ball went over the green and couldn't make it up‑and‑down.   Made a bogey.   
But I just told myself to calm down and luckily I managed to get birdie on No. 3 and No. 4.   So even though it wasn't a great start, I managed to tell myself, just be patient and then came back with a wonderful score today.
