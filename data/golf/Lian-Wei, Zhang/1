 Q.  Thoughts on how much you enjoyed playing today?  LIANWEI ZHANG: Yes I'm very happy to be here and first experience in a European Senior major event, and George gave me the greatest support during all the senior tournaments experience in Europe.  So yeah, it's a brand new start, it's a brand new stage for me in my professional golf career.   Q.  So what did you think when you played the front nine in 29, an eagle and four birdies?  LIANWEI ZHANG: I'm very happy to have the first eagle on the first hole.  I used a driver and a 7-iron on the green and one putt.   Q.  You are a young man compared to most of the other players.  So did you expect to play well?  LIANWEI ZHANG: Yes, I will try my best to play my best in a senior major.  Here I've made a lot of friends that we've played many years on The European Tour, and here I will try my best to play better and better.  I'm quite familiar with such an environment here.   Q.  Do you like being the pioneer, first player to win from China on The European Tour, first player to play in the Masters, and first to play in the Senior Open?  LIANWEI ZHANG: For China, it's at least 30 years golf history in China and many thanks for The European Tour's great support to China, and I think that it's a long way to go in my professional career.
