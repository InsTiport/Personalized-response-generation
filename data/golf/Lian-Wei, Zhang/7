   CALVIN KOH: 1-under 71, can you take us through your round today?   
 LIANG WEN-CHONG: Well, we are happy with the way we finished today, and of course, it's the weekend coming and we'll try our best.   
 ZHANG LIAN-WEI: Every day we will face some troubles and some difficult situations that we have to deal with. Today we tried our best and indeed, we are dealing with some really difficult ball situations.   
 So we did try but we'll see what's going on on the weekend.   
 CALVIN KOH: Going back to the fourballs format tomorrow, which presents a low-scoring chance. Just plans on attacking tomorrow?   
 LIANG WEN-CHONG: Tomorrow will be the last chance for us to score as low as possible for the tournament. We will try to get as many birdies as possible for tomorrow. That's the only thing that we can score.   
 ZHANG LIAN-WEI: Yes, we will attack, basically is the strategy for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. You hit the ball in the water two days in a row in the same position.   
 ZHANG LIAN-WEI: The distance is different. Yesterday I used a hybrid, and today I used a 4-iron. It was 280 yards to the pin and I didn't hit it really solid, so it goes into the water.   
 CALVIN KOH: Thanks, guys for coming.
