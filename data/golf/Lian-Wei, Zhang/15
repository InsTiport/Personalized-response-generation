ZHANG LIAN-WEI:  It was an average day for me. I started poorly with two early bogeys and from then onwards, I was kind of rushing my shots and didn't find any rhythm. My putter wasn't a solid as it has been in the last two days and had no feel at all on the greens. It was disappointing.

I'll try again tomorrow and hopefully I can regain my touch on the greens. I do need to work on my irons and driver as I didn't have a good feel as well today.
