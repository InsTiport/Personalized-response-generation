  CALVIN KOH:   Good start to the week, 4‑under; your thoughts?   
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   It's a great start.   I started with four birdies.   I started on the back nine, No. 11, and birdied No.17.   I was 5‑under after eight holes.   But on the last hole today, my tee shot went into the left rough and it was very tough to get out from that lie and I ended up with a double‑bogey.   It was very unfortunate to finish a round with a double‑bogey on the last hole.   
CALVIN KOH:   You have beaten many Major winners like Ernie Els, Nick Price in your career before, and this week we have world No. 1 Rory McIlroy, he's half your age.   Do you think you can get the better of him this week?   
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   (Laughing) Back at the China Open when I beat Ernie Els, it was almost ten years ago, and I beat Nick Price in the Macau Open, more than ten years ago.   So I've won the China Open and the Macau Open and I've always wanted to add the Hong Kong Open to be one of my wins.   
That's why I always love to come back to Hong Kong and play in the Hong Kong Open.   With such a long history here, even though McIlroy is half my age, I feel like with so many good players in the field, I still feel pretty comfortable playing and hope to have a good finish this week.   
CALVIN KOH:   The guys are winning Majors at such a young age; what advantage do you have over this young boy?   
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   I'm sure you know this, there are quite a few players in the field that are close to 50 like JimÃ©nez and OlazÃ¡bal and they are all playing well this week.   
You know, it's always back‑to‑back weeks in the European Tour, so I think with all that of the experience that I have playing in the Hong Kong Open, that will be a bit of an advantage to play with a lot of local knowledge.   
   
 Q.   When you say you put your tee shot in the rough, was that your one poor shot of the day?  
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   It is the worst shot.   
   
 Q.   Was it the only fairway missed?   
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   Only two fairways I missed and No. 10 was one of them.   
I chipped out from the rough and it was a very strong headwind, about 105 yards.   I used a gap wedge but couldn't get on the green, was short, and then missed the putt so ended up with a double‑bogey.   
I feel really good with the driver today but tomorrow I might reconsider using a 3‑wood instead of driver on No. 10.   It's a little short hole but unfortunately driver just missed the fairway and ended up with a double.   
Nobody has done it before, winning the China Open, Macau and Hong Kong Open.   I have a lot of friends from Hong Kong and I love coming over here and playing.   Hopefully I will be the first player to achieve that accomplishment.   
   
 Q.   When you were 5‑under in the first eight holes, what were you thinking?   Were you thinking that you could go even lower?  
LIAN‑WEI ZHANG:   After eight holes, I played a bit conservative, but toward the end I wanted to be a bit more aggressive.   But maybe I played a bit too safe during the middle of the round.   My best record was 61, that's the course record.   So I like the course.   (Laughing).  
I love the course, with so many good players in the field, I want to hopefully have a better score tomorrow.
