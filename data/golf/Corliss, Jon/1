Q.   Your overall thoughts on your round today?
JON CORLISS:   I was hanging in there, but I just had a brain fart on the last hole. 
I just hung in there nicely, but then I just finished, face planted on the last hole. 
But it was okay.   Nothing special.

Q.   How about the course conditions for you?
JON CORLISS:   The course is perfect.   The weather's perfect.   What amazes me is how high the scores are for how perfect the conditions are.   Which is like a statement on how difficult the course is.   It's really magnificent.
