 Q.   How did it go out there today?   I know you came in with a great little putt on 18.   
JOHN CORLISS:   It went really well.   I was so nervous for this tournament, man, I struggled yesterday because I was so nervous in the beginning.   I couldn't really play my own game.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about what happened on 18 there.   
JOHN CORLISS:   Oh, I just misclubbed.   I should have hit a 5-iron, I hit a 6-iron, it got caught up in the wind, buried in the bunker.   
I had a buried bunker shot, so I had to blast it out strong.   Then I luckily made about a 20-footer coming back.   That might be on the number, too.  
   
 Q.   Talking about the number, what would it mean to make it to the weekend here possibly at Harbor Shores?  
JOHN CORLISS:   It would be huge, man.   I've been in about, I think nine TOUR events and this would be the first cut.   
   
 Q.   Back in Virginia Beach, guys pulling for you, how is it looking back there?  
JOHN CORLISS:   Oh, yeah, they're probably watching the hole by hole live scoring.   
   
 Q.   You were hitting the ball great off the tee.   You hit 12 of 13 fairways out there.   How does that play into your game?   Do you tend to hit the ball pretty straight and keep the ball in play?  
JOHN CORLISS:   I typically do, I typically hit it straight, put it in play.   I got enough distance when I'm hitting it like I did today.  
   
 Q.   What are you looking forward to on the weekend?  
JOHN CORLISS:   I'm just looking forward to being on the first tee or even the 10th tee.
