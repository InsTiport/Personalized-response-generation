  Q. How was it out there?  
 LIN WEN-TANG: Two under, I'm happy as it was very windy out there. Everything was good except for the last hole where I missed my third shot and took a bogey. There was very little wind when I hit my approach but the winds picked up and end up in the bunker. Got out well from the bunker but then missed the putt.  
 On a tough day, 70 is a good score isnt' it? Everyone is a superstar here, Tiger, Phil and Sergio. I'm just trying to stay relaxed and play some good golf. I'm happy that I've managed to play well so far.  
  
  Q. Leaders too far to catch?  
 LIN WEN-TANG: I don't know but there are still 18 holes to go. Maybe a small chance. Phil is a very good player. Tomorrow, I'll just go out there and try to do it. I've been lucky in the final rounds this year, so hopefully I can have another lucky round tomorrow. I'll just try to do it, stay relaxed and play golf.  
  
  Q. Would you prefer it if it was windy or no wind tomorrow?  
 LIN WEN-TANG: If it's windy, I may have a chance. If there is no wind, I won't have a chance. Some holes are very difficult. If it is windy, the second shots will be very difficult. Par will be good if the winds are up. I'm putting well this week, so hopefully it will continue.
