  BRETT RUMFORD:   Just played too good right from the get‑go.   The wind got up early, it was blowing much much harder than what it is now and he just played great in the conditions.   Made some birdies through 5, 6, which got him 4‑up. 
Just really enjoyed the day.   It was quality golf.   I started to play a little bit better through the middle part of the round.   Just couldn't hole any putts and put any pressure back on Branden, so he seemingly had a nice, leisurely walk this morning. 

Q.   It looked like a quality match, and you had that run of birdies on the back nine. 
BRETT RUMFORD:   I just holed a few putts and got a little more aggressive than what you should do, but that's match play.   It's going to lend itself to getting aggressive at times and you can get those runs going. 
Obviously the turning point was 14 down the hill, putting the pressure to force to make that putt from 50 feet and of course stroke play, different story.   Of course it just turned for the worse when he holed a nice putt on the next hole, game over.
It's been a fantastic week and Per Ericsson and his team at Volvo did a fantastic job, thoroughly enjoyed myself and I hope I can experience this once again. 
Seve's run, did that include the Match Play?   That's tricky to do, any time you're trying to do two or three in a row of any tournament really, but match play is tough and there's a bit of potluck over 18 holes.   As I said at the beginning of the week, 36 holes is a different story, more time to take it back but 18 holes, you get someone like Branden that's in form playing well, his putter starts to run hot, it's going it make life very difficult. 
But I'm very happy.   I've been tired this week and I'm really just looking forward to next week, Wentworth and preparing for that.
