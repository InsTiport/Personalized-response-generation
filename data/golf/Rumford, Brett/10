Q.   Your verdict on the week?
BRETT RUMFORD:   It was a good week.   It was close.   It was really, really close.   Nice to be in the thick of it.   The back nine, I just lost a bit of momentum after a nice birdie on 12 and 13, had a great number there.   Wouldn't take anything back. 
But for some reason the 4â€‘iron went a little bit long and obviously didn't convert for par there.   Just lost the momentum and obviously gave myself some good opportunities coming home.   Hit some nice putts.   But there's tournament golf, isn't it.   But proud of Ronnie and I, we teamed up well again this week. 
The game didn't really feel on all week, and to say that, I hit some lovely golf shots but in general couldn't really find that momentum.   But yeah, look, it's a nice week.   As I said, it's nice to be in the thick of it, and you can only give yourself the opportunities.   Obviously winning twice this year, I can't be too hard on myself. 

Q.   Gleneagles, you love the place, don't you? 
BRETT RUMFORD:   Look, it's a nice week, just suits my eye and certain golf courses do that. 
Yeah, I'm looking forward to Wales next week and obviously Crans Montana, as well.   So got a couple of weeks to try to sharpen things up and go a couple better. 

Q.   You've had a front row seat for Scott Henry with an eagle at the last; how good is that? 
BRETT RUMFORD:   He played great today and he thoroughly deserves obviously being right in the mix, hopefully in a playoff, be exciting for him.   Hopefully he can just win the thing out right.   Full credit to him.   He said to me walking up the last, getting to our second shots, "How's about a couple of eagles."   Obviously made hit but, but it's great; it would be fantastic to see him hopefully win.
