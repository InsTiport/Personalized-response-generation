   BRETT RUMFORD: Is it was a productive week, you know, you're the first loser, same old clichÃ©, but really happy. Didn't really strike it that well on the back nine. Got myself in a really good position through nine. Just missed a truckload of putts, very makeable putts early, and I guess rounds one and two, as well, I did the same.
 So if anything, I'll work on my putting for the upcoming tournaments. But all in all, I'm actually happy with my game.

 Q. And you were there or thereabouts throughout the day, knowing that Marcus Fraser has run away with it in the end?
 BRETT RUMFORD: That's right. Look, it was really tough out there, and he's obviously played really steady golf, putted well and just played real sensible, in-play kind of golf. 
 Yeah, it was just really, really tough. Any miss-hit golf shots, the wind was really throwing the ball about, so obviously he's holed some nice putts, which has taken the pressure off and obviously being able just to coast in is a really nice feeling. I'm really happy for Marcus, his second win on Tour, and no one more deserving than Marcus. 
 Regardless when you win, there's a lot of guys out here that are still trying to win, and Marcus is a great guy, and he's the kind of guy that you want to see win.

 Q. I take it today is one of those days where you want to push on but the same time, you just have to defend a bit?
 BRETT RUMFORD: I gave it my all. I'm not at all disappointed with my finish or my performance. I just wasn't good enough. 

 Q. What's next? Do we see you back in Europe? 
 BRETT RUMFORD: Yeah, we're taking off tomorrow. We head back into Seville, and then play next week and then the week after that in Torino for The Italian Open and week after BMW and really after the season starts to get stuck in, so looking forward to it.
