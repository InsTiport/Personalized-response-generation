   BRETT RUMFORD: I played nicely all day. Got off to a slow start and was one over through six but then started racking up the birdies. All of a sudden I was five under and playing the last so it was a nice day.   
 I drove the ball nicely all day and you have to hit the fairways with the greens so firm, and with the wind picking up as well it is very hard to control. It is hard enough from the fairway. That's the key to this week.  
  
 The greens are about as good as I have seen any greens for a long while. You get the ball on the putting surface and you are going to have opportunities.  
  
  Q. It is key to take advantage of the morning conditions here?  
 BRETT RUMFORD: No doubt about it. I believe last year was relatively calm apart from the Saturday. Here you can get anything from sandstorms to a beautiful calm day so you take advantage of the calm and grind out the others. I took advantage of that today.  
  
  Q. Where do you feel your game is?  
 BRETT RUMFORD: Last week was a nice start after a three week lay-off and a long year. I don't feel I have had a long enough break to clear my head. I feel I am very much in touch with my form from last year and I guess the break freshened things up a bit. I saw my coach last week and things are progressing in the right direction.  
  
  Q. Work in progress in a nice part of the world?  
 BRETT RUMFORD: It is. Last time I was here was five years ago and it is a lovely part of the world. There have been plenty of changes with the Pearl development near our hotel. A lot of progress. And the course here is looking fantastic.
