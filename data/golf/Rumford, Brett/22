 Q. Level par. 
 BRETT RUMFORD: Yeah, that was some tricky pins out there today. They were placed up on the top part of all the tiers and ridges, and yeah, it was pretty tricky trying to get on the right tier. You had to be very, very precise. But, stayed patient. Hit some nice golf shots but unfortunately just kept hitting nice golf shots to about 40, 50 feet. 
 As I say, just stayed patient with it. Hence, the level par. But the greens were really, really slow. Obviously with the weather and a lot of rain and the rest of it, and a lot of growth on the front nine, after obviously playing yesterday morning as well, after coming off fresh greens to greens that had been sitting there all day was very tricky. Getting accustomed to the speed was my biggest battle out there. 
 Just patient golf and just see what happens tomorrow. 

 Q. Can't do anything about the weather, can you. 
 BRETT RUMFORD: Exactly. What can you do.
