  Q.  Your thoughts, you're tied for third?   
 CLIFF KRESGE:  I didn't get off to the start I wanted.  I had a sloppy bogey on 5 and didn't birdie 6 from the green-side and I just missed a short putt on 8 and I'm thinking I blew my chance.  All of a sudden I made a few birdies and looked at the board and said, well, I do have a chance.  If I had somehow made that putt on 18 -- but I'm excited about the way I'm playing golf right now.   
  
  Q.  Great week coming in as an alternate; couldn't ask for anything better?   
 CLIFF KRESGE:  Well, maybe two more putts to go in, that would be good.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the crowd supporting for you.   
 CLIFF KRESGE:  That was pretty exciting.  Never thought it was going to come to this but it's pretty exciting.   
  
  Q.  7-under has to be a great way to play?   
 CLIFF KRESGE:  Yeah, to see my name on the board with everybody up there, it's a dream come true.
