 Q. When you saw that, did you seriously put some pressure on yourself to firm up your irons a bit?
 CLIFF KRESGE: I didn't really try to hit ball close to the hole, I was fortunate to hit it close.

 Q. What's job one tomorrow?
 CLIFF KRESGE: If I can just keep hitting the ball pretty decent, and give myself birdie chances I'll be all right. 

 Q. How is the health situation?
 CLIFF KRESGE: A lot better today. 
 Thanks for asking. 

 Q. You've got to go get this course early and you didn't?
 CLIFF KRESGE: I didn't get off to the start I wanted. I hung in there. I knew it was going to be a tough day. I thought a couple under par would be a good score. Boo is just such a good ball-striker. 
 I played fairly decent. I luckily hit a couple close on the back to make a few birdies to get myself a good score.

 Q. You got the birdie at 16, the tee ball at 17, did you think it was going in?
 CLIFF KRESGE: It was a perfect number for me off the tee. I thought if I just hit a solid one, let the wind take it in there, I'd have a chance to get it close. I almost put it in the hole.

 Q. Did you hear the people saying "pick it up"?
 CLIFF KRESGE: I wouldn't say that was a gimme. I have to make most of those.

 Q. How do you feel now heading into Sunday? All of a sudden you're back in it?
 CLIFF KRESGE: I feel good. I feel much the same as yesterday. I think if I can just continue to drive the ball decent and hit some good iron shots, give myself opportunities I'll be okay.

 Q. Get some good solid food in you tonight will help, too. Good luck to you tomorrow. 
 CLIFF KRESGE: Thanks a lot.
