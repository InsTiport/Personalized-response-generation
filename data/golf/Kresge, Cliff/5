  Q.  Pretty good day for you, maybe some comments?   
 CLIFF KRESGE:  Yeah, real nice.  I bogeyed the first hole, had a really bad lie in the rough and couldn't get it up-and-down after that and made bogey.  But then I played real solid after that.   
 I made a couple nice par saves on 16 and 17, but after that, I had a lot of birdie chances, and if I could have made a few more putts, it would have been really good, but happy with my position.   
  
  Q.  Talk about your year so far.   
 CLIFF KRESGE:  A couple weeks ago I made a little bit of a swing change and it seemed to have really paid off.  I'm getting a little more confidence with it and I'm able to hit consistent shots and I'm just ready to play now.   
  
  Q.  You grew up in this area, so I'm sure you probably came to this tournament growing up.   
 CLIFF KRESGE:  Absolutely.  I used to get auto grooves from everybody, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, I still have them.   
  
  Q.  Obviously winning a PGA TOUR event would be great, but this one?   
 CLIFF KRESGE:  This would be as special as any major in my book because it's my hometown, so it would be really special for me.
