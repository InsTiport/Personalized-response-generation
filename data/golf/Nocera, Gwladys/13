Q.   Can you just give us an assessment of your golf yesterday, first of all, and how that changed today? 
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yesterday I played pretty good.   I missed two greens, but I was like really close to the green so I putted anyway.   So I played really solid yesterday.   It was obviously good putting. 
Today I struggled a little bit with the ball‑striking.   It wasn't as good as yesterday but I managed to miss on the good side and to make some good putts to come back for pars.   So I'm really happy.   I mean, the course is so amazing, the greens are so pure, that it's just a pleasure to play on this. 
Obviously you want to putt well because it's so good when you see the ball roll in the hole.

Q.   It's a strong field this week.   Were you expecting to be quite so high up the leaderboard when you arrived in Dubai?
GWLADYS NOCERA:   I didn't have any expectations, but last week, I played pretty good, so I mean, I'm feeling good in my game and I'm feeling good physically, so I don't want to expect too much.   It's the last tournament of the season.   I had a so‑so season, so I don't want to think about it.   I want to play my best, and see how I end up on Sunday.
