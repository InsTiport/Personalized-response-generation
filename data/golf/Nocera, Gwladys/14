 Q. Gwladys, nice round. Do you think she knew that you were only one behind her?
 GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah. Yes. You can see on the --

 Q. They took the scores down.
 GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah. You don't look over there. I think, yeah.

 Q. You made birdie on 18?
 GWLADYS NOCERA: Yes.

 Q. That had to be satisfying to put that pressure on her and give yourself a chance. 
 GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah. I mean I didn't make many putts today, so I mean that was time to make one. 
 It was good it came on 18, but I wish I had made a couple more before, but that's golf.

 Q. Now, you know Beatriz reasonably well, don't you? You've played quite a bit with her on the European?
 GWLADYS NOCERA: No, not much.

 Q. Oh, okay. What can you say about her, sort of her game, her personality?
 GWLADYS NOCERA: Well, I don't know that much, so it's hard to say anything. 

 Q. How much tougher was the course today with the weather? How much tougher did it play today?
 GWLADYS NOCERA: Well, it was much longer, and the ball didn't carry anywhere, it was so cold, so it wasn't the same course today, so yeah. 

 Q. What did you think when you saw the conditions? Did you think that would help or maybe just make it hard for everybody?
 GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah. I guess it's harder for everyone, you know. We're all in the same boat.

 Q. How long was your putt on 18? Do you know?
 GWLADYS NOCERA: It was like around six meters. 

 Q. Thank you.
