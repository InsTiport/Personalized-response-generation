Q.   Coming in with the eagle birdie finish, might have been eagle, eagle; just reflect on that round today. 
GWLADYS NOCERA:   I played pretty solid.   I didn't miss too many greens.   My driver, just made one mistake on 11.   The rest was pretty solid.   My putting is here, so that's good.   And I just love this place, so I just try to make the most of it.   It's so beautiful here, it's the best.

Q.   Describe the eagle attempt at the last. 
GWLADYS NOCERA:   I just thought about the speed and when I saw it, it was going the right direction, I had some hopes and then, yeah, I don't understand that.   But I guess that's golf. 

Q.   You said how much you love this Royal Birkdale course, and it's on this course that you achieved your best result in this championship.   Why is it that you and the players love it, and could it be something to do with the opportunities for scoring in the last few holes?
GWLADYS NOCERA:   I don't know, I think it's the links, it's very fair.   I don't know if you can say it's the fairest links I know, I haven't played all of them obviously but to me it's very fair.   If you hit good shots, you get good rewards and I like that.   We had good weather so far, so just take it and go.
I think you have to play pretty smart.   I don't think you have to be too aggressive on this course.   The rough is really high and tough, and the bunkers, you can be against the lip and have no shot.
It seems very easy when you look at it but I have to say, it's a tough one, and they set it up really hard this year.   So I don't know, I just play golf and I try to hit every shot as good as I can.   But it's a tough track.
