Q.  Tell me about your wonderful day today.
GWLADYS NOCERA:  It was just perfect.  I knew I had to play well because the girls on the team were not doing very well at the beginning, so I gave it everything that I had on each putt, on each shot, and worked it out.
Q.  Terrific putt on 16.
GWLADYS NOCERA:  Yeah, I don't know, Catrin came to me and she said, "You're doing good, come on."  I don't know, I felt really good, and I said, "Okay."
Q.  Congratulations.
