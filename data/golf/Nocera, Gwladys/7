Q.   A round of 71 today, are you a touch frustrated? 
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yeah, a little bit.   I didn't hit the ball really well in the front nine.   So I was too far away from the pin, missed a couple of greens and had a pretty bad miss, bad shots.   But the round started, not so good, so it was hard.   Then I fought really hard and I finished well. 
So, it's good.   I'm still alive.

Q.   Plenty of birdies, just need to cut out the bogeys tomorrow?
GWLADYS NOCERA:   I think I need to hit better off the tee and my irons, I had some bad kicks, bad bounces, and I was in the rough all the time.   Yeah, I just need to play better. 

Q.   I was just chatting to your caddie, we were running through the scenarios you need to still win the Order of Merit.   You're not that far away from Charley.   It's still very much on. 
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yeah, I think I have a chance.   I'll go for it tomorrow.   I'm the one that's got nothing to lose, so I will go for it no problem.
