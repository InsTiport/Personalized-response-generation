Q.   69 today, 6â€‘under par, what do you make of it? 
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Good, good.   I played really well.   I hit the ball well.   At the end of the round I was a little tired with the heat.   Didn't hit the shots as pure as I want to, but with 18 greens, I don't think you should complain too much.   Playing good.   The putts are nearly dropping, so it's coming closer.   It's good for the weekend.

Q.   A little bit about the heat.   It was actually quite oppressive today at times, hard to keep your concentration in that?
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yeah, it was more humid than the previous days, so when you have to drink so much water and sometimes you forget about it.   I think I did all right and going to rest well tonight.

Q.   You saw what Shanshan did this morning, you must have gone out there knowing you had to go low today. 
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yeah, but again, I don't think about it too much.   It's the last event of the season.   It's the best course we play all year, and I just want to enjoy and enjoy every shot, because it's so nice when you hit the ball and it's so pure and the greens are perfect.   I really want to enjoy it.   The top is the top and I can't do anything about it.   All I have to do is play my game.
