 Q.   How would you rate that round today?   Were you pleased with what you produced?   
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yeah, I played pretty good.   I didn't miss many greens so when I missed, I was just around the green.   A little bit disappointed on the few putts that I left short but overall it's another 4‑under and I can't complain.   I finished with a good birdie on 18, so it's good.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   It took a little while for the birdie to come on the back nine, didn't it.   Did you have to be patient?   
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yeah, very patient.   I think I started to be a little bit tired, maybe hungry, I don't know.   I was not close enough to the pin, and as soon as I had the right behind, I didn't have the speed so I stayed patient and I thought we had a few holes with some wedges to hit the greens, so I just stayed patient.   
   
 Q.   And take us through the 18th, a fabulous approach there.   
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yeah, I like that shot.   It's a good‑looking one, and it's tough with the sand, it's a strain on the eyes.   I left all the putts short so I thought should I just knock it close so it would be easier.  
   
 Q.   How are you feeling tomorrow?   Important to finish on a strong note today?  
GWLADYS NOCERA:   Yeah, of course, it's giving me good confidence for tomorrow.   Tomorrow is another day.   I don't know about the wind.   Sometimes it picks up and it's hard to find the right club.   I don't know, we'll see, it's another round, it's four tough rounds here.   So we will see tomorrow.
