 Q.  Little less windier conditions than the morning?  GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah, much better.   Q.  How were the course conditions and the wind?  GWLADYS NOCERA: The course is perfect, and the wind died down, so I tried to take advantage of it.  So, yeah, I played good.  Missed a couple of fairways so it got me in trouble, but I putted really well.   Q.  Coming off a win, congratulations last week.  What's been clicking with your game?  What's been working for you?  GWLADYS NOCERA: I don't know.  I've been working hard with my new coach for two years.  We -- I really enjoy what I'm doing with him.  I have fun playing golf, so I think that's the main thing.  I just take every opportunity I have to make the best of it.   Q.  Sure, what is your coach's name?  GWLADYS NOCERA: Benoit Ducoulombier.   Q.  Is he French?  GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah.   Q.  And for two years you've been working together?  GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah.   Q.  How often do you get to see him?  GWLADYS NOCERA: I saw him last week.  He was with me in Morocco.   Q.  Does he travel with you?  GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah, he does a little bit.   Q.  How was this course?  Does it feel like it suits your game?  Are you comfortable on it?  GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah, yeah.  I'm really comfortable.  I've played, I think it's my fifth time here, so I've played a couple of times.  I played Q-school here a couple of times.   Q.  Not the ones you want to remember, Q-school?  GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah, I love this course.  It's so fair.  It's so straightforward.  The greens are so pure.  It's such a pleasure to be here.  I'm having fun, so, yeah.   Q.  Is this the best golf you've played in a long time, just this stretch bringing in the momentum from last week, do you think?  GWLADYS NOCERA: Yeah, it's one of the best we've played.  I played a couple of good ones when I played on the LPGA, but this one is very special.  It's so straightforward.  If you hit good shots, you get rewarded.  If you hit bad shots, you get in trouble.  It's really fair, so I like it.   Q.  Solheim Cup this year for you, this is a huge opportunity to get some points.  Is that something in the front of your mind?  GWLADYS NOCERA: No, it's in the back.  I don't want to think about it.  I want to play golf.  I'm thinking a lot about the Olympics.  I want to get in there because that would be the end of my career pretty much, so I want to end with this.  I don't care.  If it comes, it comes.  I want to do everything I can to be ready.  If I'm on the team, I'd be the happiest person.  So, yeah, I'm trying my best, but I don't think about it.
