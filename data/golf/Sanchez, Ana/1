Q.  Janice, how does it feel now?

JANICE MOODIE:  Unbelievable.  The crowds are fantastic clapping away, singing away.  We just had some great closing matches there.  Everybody said they saw me at the top of the leader board and they just followed.  So hopefully I was a little bit of inspiration.


Q.  Little bit of Colin Montgomery?

JANICE MOODIE:  Yes, absolutely.


Q.  It's actually over quite early, isn't it?

JANICE MOODIE:  We were three ahead going into the afternoon.  We all have played very, very solid in what used to be maybe a weak team in the singles is now a strong one.


Q.  Ana, it didn't quite go for you today.  But how have you enjoyed your first taste of the Solheim Cup? 

ANA-BELEN SANCHEZ:  Today was incredible.  I was really comfortable out there.  And I played really solid, but I just make few mistakes.  And she played really good.  I'm really happy about this, and I can't believe it.  It's amazing.


Q.  What is planned in terms of celebrations?

JANICE MOODIE:  We could be at a little bit of hypothermia or something if we jumped in the water.  I'm sure the parties will go on.


Q.  Tell me, did you solve this riddle of Catrin's at the beginning of the week?

JANICE MOODIE:   I did it without even knowing.  It must have been a blond moment or something.  There was changing and shoving and then there was an "it's okay".


Q.  How would you feel about the Solheim Cup coming back to Sweden?

JANICE MOODIE:   I don't see why not.  The crowds are fantastic.  We've got a little bit of an Indian summer here.


Q.  Ana, how would you feel about playing in the Solheim Cup now that you've had a taste of it?

ANA-BELEN SANCHEZ:   I'd like it.  Today I enjoyed it a lot.  More than yesterday. 

JANICE MOODIE:   Relax a little bit.


Q.  You had your own little band of supporters on the first tee. 

ANA-BELEN SANCHEZ:   Yes.  This was a junior team.  There was four or five Spanish players, big group of fans. 


Q.  Is there anything that you can say that you've learned from this week? 

ANA-BELEN SANCHEZ:   Yes.  To be patient and fight.  That's the only thing.  Yeah.
