 Q.  So I heard you talking about the players on the first tee, what did you ask them?  Did you ask them for pointers?  
AGATHE LAISNE: I asked if he had any tricks.  He said, "Make a lot of birdies."  That was not a good trick.   
 Q.  I thought he mentioned something about 8, keep it out of the sand on 8?  
AGATHE LAISNE: No, didn't say anything about strategy.   
 Q.  Okay.  That was his advice, make a lot of birdies?  
AGATHE LAISNE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Just talk about the nerves going to 1 tee box.  I mean, it's already enough nerves, but then you have Bubba right there, just how cool is that to shake his hand?  
AGATHE LAISNE: It was huge.  I never thought I would be standing there and him watching me.  It's really cool.   
 Q.  And how many birdies did you make?  
AGATHE LAISNE: I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe three, I would say.   
 Q.  What was the biggest challenge out there?  
AGATHE LAISNE: Keep the ball like on the fairway and then the putting.  The speed was hard to get because like whenever you would get downhill, it will roll a lot, and whenever uphill, you wouldn't know how to putt it because you always had downhill.  It was hard.   
 Q.  Just the experience as a whole, talk about how much it meant to be out there competing.  
AGATHE LAISNE: It was pretty cool.  In the recording, I was looking at 12 and seeing a player hit her swing, and it was weird because it was a woman, and it's just, we don't -- we are not used to it yet.  So it's pretty special.
