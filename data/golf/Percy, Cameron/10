 Q. Tough day for you. How do you feel after that?
 CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, it was not windy. Felt like -- I had wedge after wedge after wedge and kept hitting them all to the right. So many putts just short and then struck it on 11. It's a few really poor shots.

 Q. What happened on 11?
 CAMERON PERCY: I backed off. There was a bug on my ball. Toyed back off again. Someone else moving, and I hit it in the water.

 Q. Kind of hard to regain focus?
 CAMERON PERCY: I should have put the ball up again, but...

 Q. You're not that far out of it?
 CAMERON PERCY: Absolutely. I played awful on that. I putted nicely. Not a lot of wind. I expected it to be a lot quicker. I left a lot of putts short.
