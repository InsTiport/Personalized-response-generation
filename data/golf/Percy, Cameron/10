   THE MODERATOR: Cameron Percy shot a 9-under today to get to 17-under for the tournament. Just try to take us through your round, and we'll take some questions.   
 CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, hit a nice shot on the 1st, made birdie, and then the 3rd hole, I made a lucky two-putt. I hit it on the wrong side of the tier, just two-putted that one and then whacked it eight feet by on the next hole and just two-putted that, as well, and hit a good shot on the par-3 and made it.   
 Hit a 6-iron on the next hole to two feet, which I was pretty happy with there, because it was a pretty hard pin, so that was an easy birdie.  
 And then I was just in the fringe a foot off the green on the next hole and made that.  
 And then 9, just on the front of the green, chipped up to a foot, made that.  
 Hit a pitching wedge into about eight feet, made that.  
 12, I hit a wedge in there to about eight feet, made that.  
 13, I was on the front of the green and didn't get up-and-down which was a bit disappointing because it kind of killed my momentum.   
 The next hole I was on the fringe, which is annoying.  
 And then I drove the next hole, which I only made par there, too.   
 I drove it in the rough on 16, had a bit of a squirrelly lie and hit a 3-iron out of the rough over the water. I was a bit nervous about that one, to about 50 feet, I think, and then I saw Badds had made a 48-footer on the last, so we both made a long putt. It was like 54 feet someone told me. It was a straight putt from 54 feet. From 20 feet out it looked like it was going in, and it went in.  
 And then the last hole hit a wedge to probably six or seven feet and made that, as well.   
 I had a chance on 17 from about ten feet, but I misread that one.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, I didn't hit it very good today. The first two days I hit the ball -- Thursday I hit it fantastic and missed everything, and the second day I hit it pretty close yesterday and missed a fair few putts. I missed a three-footer that lipped out on the last yesterday in the dark, and I was just really frustrated, and I three-putted that hole from about 15 feet or something. I was really frustrated. It's rough being out there in the last group, 156 guys on the greens. So they were perfect today and really fast. There were a lot of pins where you couldn't hit under the hole or it was going to go in the water, so you had to hit it past the hole, and I kept making them down the hill basically, so it was quite nice.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, I just had a little bit of luck on 16, hitting it half decent. It wasn't a great lie but it wasn't a horrible lie, so I could actually hit it across the water. If it was two feet to the left it would have been worse where I had to hit a wedge and lay it up and try to get up-and-down from there. Just that little bit of luck you get that changes things.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: As far as getting to the end of the year, the World Series is on, as well, it doesn't matter if you lose by 5 or 20, you've just got to sort of do it sort of attitude. This is what I have to do. There's no waiting for next week. There is no next week. I have to do it.  
  
  Q. Is this your last tournament?  
 CAMERON PERCY: Disney. I think I'll get in Disney.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: I think so, yeah, but it's the sort of course where you know -- even though I was doing well today, I had to keep going forward because you didn't know, guys could shoot anything out there. There's been a few 62s already this week. You feel like it's not enough until you get to the last hole.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: I've actually hit the ball really good this year. When you miss the fairways by a foot or two, it's the worst rough. That's what I do, I miss fairways by two or three yards, not 20 yards, so you feel like you've got to hack it out to get it to the green sort of thing. I've been putting really, really poorly this year, too, so that doesn't help.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: Oh, for sure. The first round I should have shot 10- or 12-under easy. I missed a heap of putts the first round. I hit it really close. And then yesterday I hit a few close and missed them and then got a few at the end there. Even yesterday I didn't get up-and-down from the front of the 15th again and I three-putted. On the last hole I had a three-footer straight up the hill, and I missed that, as well. Pretty poor.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: I didn't take up golf until I was 16. I was just starting to get half decent at the game, and I think I turned pro at 25, I think. I didn't have enough money to turn pro. I would have loved to turn pro at 21 or 22, but I couldn't afford to travel anywhere.  
  
  Q. Where did you play?  
 CAMERON PERCY: I played in Australia and the Asian Tour. I played there a couple of years. And then I actually came over here one year with a friend and tried to money qualify, spent six months just driving around, trying to Monday qualify, kept missing out by two or three shots each week. So that's pretty tough.   
  
  Q. How did you deal with that pressure?  
 CAMERON PERCY: You feel it every week. You're just anxious, nervous, irrational.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: No, this year has been crazy.   
  
  Q. Could this be a life-changing experience?  
 CAMERON PERCY: Absolutely. If I can win tomorrow, all of a sudden you're in bigger tournaments, free money tournaments basically. Those free money tournaments add up when you're trying to keep your card.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: Well, even if I finish 5th it would still bump me up to about 160th on the Money List, so a 5th isn't going to cut it sort of thing. It's amazing how much money you've got to make.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: Oh, yeah, absolutely. All my friends are on this TOUR and doing really well. I used to be able to beat those guys comfortably a couple of years ago, but they've taken their chance and run with it. And I was just going out trying to Monday qualify on the Nationwide Tour, which is quite tough to do.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: Everyone tells me it's firm and fast, and it's been wet and soft. I've been lucky that way because I'm hitting driver everywhere where everyone else is hitting 3-wood or 2-iron here, and I'm hitting driver everywhere.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: Just the greens. There's still 156 people on them, and the ball rolls through footprints and pitch marks. They were dramatically different today.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 CAMERON PERCY: The first day it drove it great, then the last two days I was missing it two yards right on every hole. I was trying to hit a little draw and it's fading. It feels like it's going to hit every fairway and it's just to the right.
