 Q. Cameron, nice playing out there. How would you assess your play?  
CAMERON PERCY: I actually played pretty good. I played just in the rough all day, though, so really tricky. I hit a few shots on the right lines and they weren't. I hit it close and missed a few today. I've made a lot of putts in there. In the last hole I drive it like an inch in the rough, come up an inch short. Kept making bogies.  
   
 Q. There's a lot of people near the top of this leaderboard. How do you feel about your position?  
CAMERON PERCY: Pretty happy until five minutes ago. Birdie would have been nice. Just made another -- hit it on the front and roll up. Same thing on 14, just hit a poor chip as well there.  
   
 Q. Can you talk about the position for the FedExCup Playoffs? Looks like you're very close right now. How much do you think about that?  
CAMERON PERCY: The last probably two months I played really nicely and should have finished a lot better. Just a shot or two here and there I'll be all right. Won't sleep much tonight and won't eat breakfast very well tomorrow and go again tomorrow.  
   
 Q. Best of luck.  
CAMERON PERCY: Thank you.
