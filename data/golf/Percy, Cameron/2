Q. Congratulations on a great round finishing back-to-back birdies. Lunch is going to taste fantastic, isn't it?
CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, certainly is. I mucked up the 15th hole. I had a three-putt there.
Got through 16 and birdied 17, 18. Yeah, it was real nice.
Q. Tell me about your feelings of making it back to the PGA TOUR after finishing top 50 regular season last year in the Korn Ferry Tour.
CAMERON PERCY: Just really excited. Almost felt my career was over halfway through the year. I'm like, Wow, this is going to be it. You just realize how privileged you are to be out here playing this TOUR.
Then this week we turn up and they've got green eggs for us, coolers, shoes, pants. Then just the food and they way they treat us is just amazing. Sometimes you take it for granted, when then when you're away from it and you think it's gone, and you appreciate how good it is out here.
Q. Do you think that's resulted in your good play not only today, but to make it back here.
CAMERON PERCY: I think so. Just I thought, Oh, this is it. I'm going to do something with I kids and get a regular job or whatever. I played great the first playoff event, and the second event I just knew I had to play solid and I did that.
It's just pretty cool with what we get to do and you just don't realize how lucky you are.
Q. How is the hand?
CAMERON PERCY: Really sore actually.
Q. Still?
CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, the wrist is quite sore.
