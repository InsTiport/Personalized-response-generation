  Q. Good playing out there. Can you just give us your thoughts on what might have clicked out there?  
 CAMERON PERCY: You know, I was really struggling through about 8, 9. It was getting hot and sweaty and I was struggling swinging it in the wind. And then just really slowed everything down as much as I possibly could and actually drove the ball pretty good on the back nine, which I needed to, and made a few putts, which was really nice.   
  
  Q. Condition-wise was the wind down compared to yesterday?  
 CAMERON PERCY: It was definitely down, and you could definitely score a lot better today because instead of being a two- or three-club breeze it was like one and you could stand up, so that helps.   
  
  Q. Just going into the weekend is it one round at a time kind of thing?  
 CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, it just depends on what the weather is going to be like tomorrow, where all the pins are and stuff. I'm just going to try and do the same thing.  
  
  Q. Any one shot that sticks out today?  
 CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, I hit a poor shot on about 5 and got up-and-down out of the bunker and holed about a ten-footer for par, and that kept me going sort of thing. I had a couple of chances for birdie up until then and just missed and then all of a sudden had a par putt and made it, and then birdied the next, birdied the next.   
 Then didn't get up-and-down on 8, which was a bit annoying. I was right in a sprinkler. I was wanting to putt it but I had to chip it, and I chipped it about six feet past. That was a bit annoying. But apart from that, I can't be any happier.  
  
  Q. Strong birdie to finish out. Take us through that last hole.   
 CAMERON PERCY: Yeah, hit a good drive, couldn't take the bunker on today so had to hit it down the middle and just killed it and had wedge in, hit it to about eight feet, and I thought it was downgrain a bit more, and it fell in the front edge. Yeah, was pretty lucky to get there in the end.
