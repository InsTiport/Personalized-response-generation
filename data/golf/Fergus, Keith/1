  Q. How were the conditions this morning?   
 KEITH FERGUS: Pretty ugly. It was cold, windy, a little rainy at times. All the things that I don't like about playing golf.   
  
  Q. You got through it all right and you had the putt on 14.   
 KEITH FERGUS: Yeah, I made, that was just one of those lucky ones, you shut your eyes.   
 But I played okay in those conditions. My short game was good. I missed some shots, but I hit some good ones. I made some putts. And it was survival, that's what it was.  
  
  Q. What are you going to do to get ready for tomorrow?  
 KEITH FERGUS: I'm going to go eat a little lunch right now and then go practice, probably come back out a little later when hopefully the sun will come out and it warms up and hopefully it will be a little warmer tomorrow, I hope.
