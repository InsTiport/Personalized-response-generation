 Q. What does it mean to be back here?
 RICKY BARNES: A lot, limited field. It proves that you did something good enough to get back in here. It's not a one-week qualifier kind of thing like the Open. You can't just kind of come out and qualify for it. A lot. 
 You know, I love being back here. I always wanted to get back here as a pro and not just an invite from a member. So I'm glad to be back.

 Q. Have you played it since '03?
 RICKY BARNES: Twice, yeah. 

 Q. Did you feel like the forgotten man shooting 68 or so and everyone kind of cleared out and --
 RICKY BARNES: That's fine with me. If I'm shooting 68 and I'm forgotten, that's fine with me.

 Q. Compared to a Nationwide Sunday, not even close, but talk about how it was like people just falling away from you. 
 RICKY BARNES: Yeah, and we had some weather. I think that had something to do with it, people that kind of saw a player come through, then the weather, they knew it was coming, so they're like, let's get out of here pretty quick. 
 It was fine. We made some good stuff in our group on the back nine, so we're going to take that into tomorrow.

 Q. With your brother on the bag, is there anything that he does a little bit differently?
 RICKY BARNES: No, I've been playing pretty good this year with my full-time caddie. My brother kind of did the U.S. Open last year and we had planned on it to begin with. I wasn't really sure who I had on my bag. I'm glad to have him back. He's kind of out of retirement. He's coaching in Tucson year-round, so they finished up their last tournament last Saturday, and here we are.

 Q. Did you guys get a fair amount of overflow from the Tiger crowds?
 RICKY BARNES: It was cool. They kind of sat, watched us, and it seemed like they moved on. My guess is a lot of people took off after they got to see him a hole or two because of the weather coming in.
