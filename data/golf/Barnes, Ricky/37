 Q. Ricky, good run, on the backside you got into it. A lot of guys got into it. Boy, it was tough coming home, wasn't it?
 RICKY BARNES: I had a couple of good looks. My putter let me down a little bit. In the middle of my round with the good birdie looks. On the back nine I made some good swings. I had some really good swings. Par-5, needed a good yardage to the front pin and I three-putted that. And then 16, 17 and 18 are tough holes. So it being downwind, it's tough to keep it on the green.
 Overall I swung it pretty well this week. And I actually swung it pretty well this day. It's a good thing, you know, it's the end of a five-week stretch.

 Q. I was going to say, you will take, to the rest that you're going to have now the next couple of weeks off, some good thoughts and some momentum headed into Texas.
 RICKY BARNES: Yeah, I hit a low left kind of draw off the tee, but I hit a great third shot after my drop. I hit a great 8-iron. Good swing to end the week on and mentally I'm pretty good to go. Rest for a week now. 

 Q. You're a little fried?
 RICKY BARNES: Yeah. I'm going to go and probably come back out, play two more and then get another week off. I'm satisfied with my five-week run, and I guess I deserve a week off. 

 Q. I think you do. Again, congratulations on your first trip here. Hope to have you book again soon. 
 RICKY BARNES: Yeah, hopefully we're coming back. Thank everyone for coming out, it was a great tournament.
