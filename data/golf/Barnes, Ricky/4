 Q.  Solid round of golf in some tough conditions today.  How dry is it getting out there, and how tough was it to post a score like that today?  
RICKY BARNES: Yeah, especially coming off our back nine, which was the front nine yesterday, it felt like the greens, fairways, were crazy hard, tough to get close.   
Today, to take away from it, hit a lot of greens.  Left myself a lot of kind of tap-ins for pars and I took care of the par 5s today.  I think I birdied every par 5.  I think I birdied one other hole besides a par 5.  And like I said, if I missed a fairway, it seemed like I was able to hit the ball in the middle of the green, get a 2-putt and get away.   
Like there on 18, seemed like a 300-something whatever drive, hit sand wedge and it rolls to the back edge, which I bet you later, sand wedges out of the rough are going to roll to the back of the green.  Good to get a 2-putt and get out of there.  Anything in the 60s today and this afternoon will be a good round.   
 Q.  In the valley, is it tough guessing the wind?  Is it a guessing game or can you get a true read?  
RICKY BARNES: It is a little bit of a guess.  I got fooled on the par 315.  We thought we played, 12, 13, 14, pretty stress-free.  Then I hit a shot that got crazy knocked up on 15 and got up-and-down.  But it is tough, because you trust it up top on 11 tee, and really, you don't get that same wind until you get on 16 tee again.   
 Q.  Hitting over 70 percent of your greens in regulation, iron play is solid.  What do we work on tonight, if anything, to make a push tomorrow on moving day?  
RICKY BARNES: I feel like I'm playing good.  I'm actually not even going to go.  I'm going to go get some rest.  I played quite a bit.  It's hot out here and the range really isn't that favorable wind to go do much practice.   
Like you said, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
