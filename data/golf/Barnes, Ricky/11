Q. Briefly, tell me about the hole in one?  What number is it for you?RICKY BARNES: Yeah, it was a perfect 8-iron.  The guy before me hit a good 8-iron, and he said it's a good, stock solid, driving range 8-iron.  I think the yardage was 165 into a little breeze, and it just landed right in the hole and never came out.Q. We saw you get in the car.  How exciting is that to win a car?RICKY BARNES: Yeah, it's super exciting.  The toughest shot after that whole deal is the drive on the next hole.  There is so much adrenaline.  Cool car.  You almost want to sit there and let the other group play through. It's awesome.  What a cool car.  I've had some hole in ones before, but never for anything like this.Q. You win something, but also somebody else wins something.  What's it mean for Quicken Loans to give somebody that?RICKY BARNES: Yeah, that's huge.  People's mortgage?  You never know who that is.  We're always happy to help.  I think it's unbelievable what Quicken Loans does for it.  That's first and foremost.  So let's thank them for the mortgage, and let's thank BMW for putting up the car this week.
