 Q. 1-under on the first day. Can you give me your overall thoughts on the round?
 RICKY BARNES: I played well. I played really well. I hit a second shot in the water on 12 with a 6-iron into a par-5, so there's two shots right there. But I'm happy. Hit a couple other good shots on the next hole. It was really a two-hole string where I didn't really score well, but I played really good all 18 holes. I'm happy with it, go get some rest and be back tomorrow.

 Q. What do you take from today's round to apply to tomorrow and the weekend?
 RICKY BARNES: That I hit it really well. I hit a lot of fairways today, and that's what you need to do out here to control your ball into these greens. You know, you can score from the fairway out here and you're scrambling from the rough, so just hitting fairways out there, greens, and taking par when need be.
