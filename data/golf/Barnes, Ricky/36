 Q. Nice round of 69. Tell us about your round today. 
 RICKY BARNES: Pretty up and down. It kind of reminded me of the last round I played in Hilton Head, a lot of birdies, probably right around 3-under. Good comeback. I took last week off, just took some rest, got my mind off a lot of things. I came back and was pretty happy with the way I played. I definitely played the last six, seven holes pretty good. I think I played the last six holes 2-under. 
 And I shot 3-under only birdieing one par-5, so I've got to look on the bright side there. I'll go hit a few shots here and cool down for tomorrow.

 Q. What is it about Quail Hollow that will equal success?
 RICKY BARNES: Fast greens and pretty undulating. You've got to have your distance control. Kevin Stadler and I think had three putts in a row on 16, 17, 18 that we were pretty much laying up, and they were all inside about 12 feet. Depending on where you hit it, it's one of those courses where three yards off can cost you a 25-footer as opposed to about a six-footer. 
 You know, I did that pretty well today. My distance control was pretty good. The ones that I wasn't on I was able to at least get out of there pretty easily with two-putts and stuff like that.
