   RICKY BARNES: It was a good, solid week. Did I play good enough to probably get a top 2 today? No. I got off to a good start. I wanted one more. I hit two great shots into 18 and hit the putt right where my caddie and I said.  
 Still a good week. I think I'm T8. I'll take that to Pebble next week and build some momentum because it's my last event on the West Coast.  
  
  Q. Tell me about being out here now full-time. You've played well so far on the West Coast. How much momentum and confidence is that giving you to kind of say to yourself, you know what, I am doing okay out here and everything is cool?  
 RICKY BARNES: Yeah, I feel good. This is a pretty good ball striker's golf course. It was wet today. You had to get good yardages, and I have done that pretty well on the West Coast. Had a really good lead-in to this week by shooting 4-under on Sunday in San Diego, had a good solid round of 2-under, could have easily been 3- or 4-under today here, and kind of looking forward to going up to my neck of the woods up north. I kind of grew up around northern California. It'll be a good end hopefully to the West Coast Swing.   
  
  Q. Who are you playing with at Pebble, anybody we should know about?  
 RICKY BARNES: I've been fortunate. I've played the last three years with just some good guys. Four years ago I played with Ray Romano, and I just happened to get paired with him. I'm just kind of one of those guys, go with the flow.
