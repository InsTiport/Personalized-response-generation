 Q.   Ricky, the winds came up and became a very difficult golf course.  
RICKY BARNES:   Yeah, actually well only one hole, made a bad double bogey.   Other than that I shoot probably 1-under pretty easily today.   
Hit the ball, you know, good again, put a lot in the fairways.   Had some good looks.   Had a couple tap-ins for birdies and, you know, overall pretty good.   Conditions got tough the last 9 holes for us, lot of crosswinds and some tough holes playing tougher.  
   
 Q.   Double bogey was strange, came on the par 5 5th.   You had only one bogey in the tournament up to that point, that was with a 3-putt on 17 in the opening round.   Double bogey kind of cropped up.  
RICKY BARNES:   Yeah, one bad shot and kind of had to play down another fairway.   Really had no other option.   If I had another option I probably would have chipped out, gone that way.   
You know, like I said yesterday, if you only have one bogey around this course you're going to do okay.   I just had one bogey again today.   Got to eliminate the doubles.  
   
 Q.   Besides that double bogey still a solid round of golf in challenging conditions and you're going to be one of the leaders going off on Saturday.  
RICKY BARNES:   Yeah.   I was just saying probably within three, four going into the weekend and that's a spot I haven't been in but I'm looking forward to competing this week.   I keep doing what I'm doing, I'll have a good chance.
