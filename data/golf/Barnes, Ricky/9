Q. Ricky Barnes, a 6-under 65, a good score but even better considering the start.
RICKY BARNES: Yeah, actually kind of lucky the one tree got on the right side on 10.  I was behind it and I had to chip out, and then solid pretty much after that.  I think I only missed two greens from there on, had a lot of good uphill putts out here I could be aggressive with, and yeah, good start, 6-under.
Q. Given the course and the condition it is in and the weather, is it perfect for golf?
RICKY BARNES: Yeah, it really is.  Greens are somewhat soft than what we're used to.  We're used to a pretty good first bounce out here.  The weather is benign.  I think it's gusting to 4.  And you've got to score.  Days like this, if you're hitting the fairways, you've got some short clubs in, you're firing at pins.
Q. Given that Michael Thompson has gone off like a firecracker, as well, it must have been a fun day for you guys out there.
RICKY BARNES: Yeah, I think Michael made one par on the front, and it helps when you've got a lot of birdies going on in your group.  Scott made a late charge to get to 2- or 3-under.  It was a good group.  I look forward to more of the same tomorrow.
