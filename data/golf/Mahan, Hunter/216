  Q.  Well played, 2-up victory.  As a Hunter you're used to early mornings, you were first out today.   
 STEVE STRICKER:  That's what I told my caddie walking out.  This would be a great morning to be in the tree because there was a little chill in the air, and cool and crisp.   
 We did well again today, Hunter and I.  We teamed up well and we're going to go back out this afternoon and try it again.   
  
  Q.  Maybe the putt of the match took place on the 7th hole, the par 3, you made a 20-footer for par that halved the hole that looked like you may have lost.   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  Yeah, after the sixth hole, got one back there, didn't want to lose any momentum and made a nice putt there and carried us on there.   
 Then stretched some really good holes together and finished strong?   
  
  Q.  You're playing in the afternoon?   
 STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, we enjoy each other's company, we're doing well, so why not I guess.   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  We got off to a good start, hitting lots of fairways and we kind of put some pressure on them.  Kept putting the ball in play and in good position, and we had a good middle stretch there where we won a bunch of holes and got a nice lead.   
  
  Q.  What about alternate-shot, normally this is not the U.S.'s strength and you were controlling alternate-shot.   
 STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, it's nice to see.  We needed to come out today and put a little pressure back on them I think and we came out and made a little bit of a statement, and we need to do the same thing this afternoon.  We just can't rest on our laurels, really, and we need to come out and do the same thing this afternoon.
