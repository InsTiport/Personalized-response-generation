Q.   Looks like a good day today, five birdies and just the 12th hole. 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, I played great all day.   Started out nice.   Hit a lot of really good shots.   Didn't hit it great off the tee.   Kind of put me in some spots I didn't really probably want to be at but grinded it out and easily my best round of the week.   I was patient and I stayed focus on what was in front of me and just kept plugging away. 
Even the bogey hole, I hit a good putt.   It just didn't go in.

Q.   Do you feel like the delay or the weather hampered anything for you at all? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   No.   It's just a part of golf.   You're going to have stuff like that and delays like that and things like that.   It's your job as a professional to kind of persevere through that stuff and make the best of it and when it's your turn to play, you have to step up and hit a good shot.
