Q.   Just as you're walking, could you just talk a little, basically repeat what you just said back there?
HUNTER MAHAN:   I mean, we knew this was coming, so I think we were all somewhat prepared for the cold and everything.   But I think we also didn't think we were actually high enough to get really snow and get this amount.   I thought we would get some sleet stuff, and sure enough we did.   We got sleet and ice and you can't putt or hit shots with ice coming at you. 

Q.   How prepared were you for it?
HUNTER MAHAN:   I didn't feel too bad.   It's hard to keep your hands warm.   That is the difficult part because your hands are still cold, and they were connected to the club and your feeling of everything just isn't quite there.   By the last three shots we hit, it was unbelievable, crazy.

Q.   You are off to a great start obviously in defense of your title.   How do you keep the momentum going?   You just chill out, unwind, shut down? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   I mean, you just keep playing, just prepare tomorrow like it was for a whole round and focus on hitting good quality shots.   Here it is important to hit good quality shots and put the ball in play and put the ball on the green.
