 Q. This is probably the toughest way to miss a cut.  Can you describe what happened?HUNTER MAHAN: Not much to describe, I just hit the wrong ball.  I looked at the ball.  It looked -- I mean I don't know, it was one of those things I couldn't explain to you.  Off the tee, it looked like that's where my ball should have been, and I couldn't explain to you how it ended up where it did.  Just got to pay more attention.
Q. In a Major, you pay so much attention to detail, and you take every step, every blade of grass, everything carefully.  As a person I'm sure who does that, how does something like this just affect your attitude?HUNTER MAHAN: I don't know.  It's one of those fluke things.  I've played a lot of rounds of golf now and it's happened maybe one time before.  It's a fluke thing.  I couldn't tell you how or why it happened or -- it was crazy.  It was just strange.
Q. How did the course treat you?  What were the good sides, what were the bad sides?HUNTER MAHAN: The course is in great shape.  The USGA did a good job of setting it up right.  It's right where it should be.
