 Q.   What is going through your mind right now?   
HUNTER MAHAN:   Nothing right now.   I mean, trying to figure out how I can play better really.   What I'm trying to think right now is what can I do to start changing my game right now.   I don't know, I'll just have to think about it, I guess, and try to strategize and change something up.   
   
 Q.   Is the Ryder Cup a weight on your shoulders?   Did that add any pressure this week?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, shoot, I mean, you want to make the team.   It's plain and simple, it's not like you can just forget about it.   It's not like it's not there and not going to impact you.   
   
 Q.   I know it's a tough thing for you right now.   Has Davis given you any indication when he may contact you by text or phone?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   No.  
   
 Q.   So tonight you just kind of hang and hope and that sort of thing?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   I guess so.
