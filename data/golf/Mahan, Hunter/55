Q.   What a day.   Talk about the hole‑in‑one.   There's a lot of great stuff that comes with that ace.   Walk us through the hole. 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, just a 5‑iron.   The wind is maybe just a little bit in and right to left, so it's a great pin to go after because it is on the left side.   I hit it, and I hit it solid, it was just left of the hole.   Obviously needed a good kick, and I saw it bounce, and I thought, it's going to be okay, and from there we just heard the roars, and it just got better and better and better, and it just went in.

Q.   The reaction was fantastic.   You were like a gladiator in a Roman coliseum there. 
HUNTER MAHAN:   That's what it feels like sometimes.   There were a lot of people.

Q.   A couple of great rewards with that ace, thanks to the folks from BMW.   One, you're going to get a brand new BMW, a brand new electric BMW, so you can just tool around in that beautiful car. 
HUNTER MAHAN:   That's awesome news.   That's great.   Excited about that.

Q.   And the other great piece of news is the fact that BMW is going to contribute $100,000 to the Evans Scholars Foundation, which means some kid, a caddie, is going to go to college, full scholarship, thanks to your hole‑in‑one. 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Well, that's amazing.   That's awesome of BMW to do that, to have that Evans Scholarship.   I remember playing the Western Junior and hearing about it, and it's a great thing that they do.   Caddies are a big part of golf, and it's awesome that a kid is going to have a great education, so that's amazing.
