  Q. You're 1-up in your match with Mike Weir, you're in the crosswalk between 17 and 18 and I hear you yukking it up with the gallery talking to some friends, a big smile on your face.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, it was a good match. I felt like I played pretty well. I've got some friends here. As long as I was hitting the shots, nothing to worry about.  
  
  Q. It's remarkable that you could maintain that calm and composure; a 1-up lead heading into the 18th and you're relaxed enough to trade a few laughs with friends?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I felt pretty good about my game. I wasn't going to change from 17 to 18, so I just had to keep playing and just hit a fairway.  
  
  Q. Mike Weir is in pocket with par on the 17th, you have a difficult bunker shot. I've seen you hit lots of good bunker shots, and that was another one. You executed perfectly.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, the sand is phenomenal here. You can put a lot of spin on the ball. You can do anything you want with it. I had a good lie, had a good look at it, and with a little bit of luck, it could have gone in.  
  
  Q. Rory McIlroy up next?   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, should be exciting. I don't know much about him, but I know he's a great player, a young European player, probably going to be a Ryder Cupper very soon, so looking forward to it.  
  
  Q. Speaking of the Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup, you're getting pretty good at this match play. You like the format obviously?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: Oh, it's so much fun. I think it suits me pretty well, and it's a nice change from playing tournament golf, four rounds every week.
