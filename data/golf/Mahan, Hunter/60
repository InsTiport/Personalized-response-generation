Q.   Hunter Mahan started on the back nine and where some players really took advantage of some of those parâ€‘5s, you struggled there.   You managed to save your round with a great front nine.   How did you do it? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   I just kept playing.   I didn't hit it great on my opening 9, but started to hit it better on the first one and two on the back nine, got some momentum. (Indiscernible).   Made a lot of good putts. 

Q.   Overall, only hit 11 greens, as we talked about before the week that was going to be the key.   But you're happy with the short game to hold it together today? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, I hit some good bunker shots, gave myself an opportunity.   I putted really well.   That was my key today.   I made some nice putts, and I think I missed the ball in the right spot so my chips weren't that difficult.

Q.   Can you talk about that round and put it in perspective for us? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, kind of the tale of two nines.   I did okay in my opening nine.   Just didn't hit it great.   Didn't give myself a lot of great looks at birdie, but certainly on 1 and 2, I got some momentum on my side and hit it good after that.   Gave myself a lot of good looks and the greens were rolling true.   It's in great shape right now.   In the morning we'll have perfect conditions.

Q.   Are there some low rounds out there do you think?
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, I think the first two days of the afternoon wave is going to be tougher for sure.   In the morning, the greens are pure, cooler temperatures, and the wind is not blowing quite as hard, so it will be a good start.

Q.   Do you feel like you got yourself in a good spot in the first round here? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, as good as you can.   It's only one out of four, but I feel good about my game.   I'm excited about what I'm doing right now and excited about how I'm playing this course.
