 Q. You got the second point of the day, how do you feel? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Great. I think when they put me out first, I need the to set the tone. I didn't want to get the match off to a loss and luckily Stewart played great so, that was two great matches there. 

 Q. 2-down after two, what were you thinking? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: 16 holes left. I gave him those two holes, but he played solid. We didn't give each other many holes and it was nice to make a few putts there and to finish it off the way I did. 
 I talked to Tiger last night, and it was important to set the tone and we needed a good start. We couldn't give up the lead and give up early points.

 Q. Walking to the third tee, what were you saying to yourself? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Just go back to basics, try to hit some fairways, try to hit some greens and try to get into the rhythm of the round. I knew I was playing good and I just had to keep playing. 

 Q. I get the sense that you're really pumped up. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: I'm jazzed. I'm jazzed. I'm really excited right now.
