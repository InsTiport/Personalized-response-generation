  HUNTER MAHAN:   I was just trying to make shots and give myself a lot of birdies. 

Q.   Are you pleased to make that Sunday charge, at least get yourself in the mix a little bit? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, I played, had a good weekend and played really well on the weekend.   Just disappointed with the finish I guess.   You know, I hit a ton of good shots today. 

Q.   That being said, how excited are you to head back out to the Match Play and defend your title? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   I'll get excited when I get there.

Q.   What do you think about the place?   Obviously a great win last year over Rory?
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, match play is fickle.   You can play great and go home in the first day.   So you know, it's really six individual tournaments against world class competition.   You have to step on the first tee on the first day and play well. 
I feel good about what I'm doing and the game feels good.
