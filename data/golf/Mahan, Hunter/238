Q.
Hunter Mahan, can I get you to talk about your round a little bit?
HUNTER MAHAN:  I played -- I putted pretty bad today.  When you get on the green and you miss the putts, it's hard to come back from there.  I didn't drive it too bad.  I think I felt good about being in the fairway most of the time, I just had no momentum today.  I was just fighting myself and fighting the round, so that's tough to get on top of. 

Q.
How did it feel?  Was it a different approach standing on the first fee of your first professional event? 
HUNTER MAHAN:  No, you just try to play your game and do what you know how to do.  It was fun being out there.  I'm just looking forward to tomorrow.
