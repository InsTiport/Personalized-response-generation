  HUNTER MAHAN:   I felt like‑‑ it seemed like the wind picked up from yesterday.   The wind whipping through these trees is very unpredictable sometimes, and you've really got to watch yourself and make sure you hit good quality shots.   If you don't, it's going to go in the water.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
    HUNTER MAHAN:   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about your eagle on 7?  
    HUNTER MAHAN:   I just made birdie.   It was an easy birdie.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about the afternoon?  
    HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, it was blowing yesterday.   It's difficult.   You've really got to pay attention.   You can hit a quality shot but that can end up in a bad spot.  
   
 Q.   You have to make hay on the par‑5s?  
    HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, you can make them look really easy and it can be really difficult, too.   There's water on‑‑ in play on three of them.   You have to pick your spots.   If you play them under par every day, you don't have to play them 4‑under or 3‑under, but if you play them under par every day you're doing good.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
    HUNTER MAHAN:   They're kind of reachable, they're kind of not.   You have to make good drives to reach them, you have to have a good wind.
