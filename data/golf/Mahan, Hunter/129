  Q. Talk about your round.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, played pretty solid pretty much most of the day. Just a couple bogeys at the end. But hit it good, put the ball in play most of the day and had some good up-and-downs at key times.   
 You know, everything feels pretty good.   
  
  Q. Conditions change? Seems to be on a regular basis?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, obviously this morning, it was at its peak of the wind. It was blowing pretty hard. Seemed like throughout the day it got a little bit softer. So I felt like it was actually a good thing that I got to play this morning. Kind of got to see the golf course, playing as tough as it was.   
 But it's great right now.   
  
  Q. Are you working hard or does it feel like it's on cruise control?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: No, you're working hard on every shot. You can't really lose focus out here. It seems like there's water on every hole, so you can make a bogey or a double pretty fast.
