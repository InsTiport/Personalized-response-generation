Q. Just take me through your round today.  How did you play, and are you happy with where you're at?
HUNTER MAHAN: I played okay.  I need to hit it better.  I didn't hit it as good as I need to hit it for the scores I need to shoot on this golf course.  I'm rolling it great with the putter, so I just need to get myself some more opportunities.
Q. How are the conditions out there?  I know it's wet.
HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah.
Q. Is that helpful in a way or is it sort of --
HUNTER MAHAN: Well, it's helpful for low scores.  The greens are rolling really good.  They have really good greens.  The course is -- you miss the fairway, it's going to be tough out of the rough, but it's very manageable.
Q. What's going to be the key to your game the next couple days?
HUNTER MAHAN: Just being aggressive, got to hit good iron shots, got to give myself an opportunity to make a lot of birdies.
Q. You're the only guy that's played every tournament so far in the FedExCup Playoffs.  What would it mean the next two days to go out there and put up a couple good rounds and make it to East Lake?
HUNTER MAHAN: It would mean a lot.  The goal is to make the TOUR Championship every single year, means you've had one of the better years on the TOUR, and everybody wants to be there.  I've got a lot of work to do, but looking forward to the challenge and the next two days.
