  Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the round today?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, obviously played nice. Gave myself a lot of good looks. I had a couple nice little up-and-downs at the beginning to keep the round going, and then hit it well. I only really missed, gosh, one or two shots today.  
  
  Q. How important after the tough eighth hole was it to come out and birdie 10, 11 and 12 to get the back side started?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, it was obviously very disappointing because I was playing so well and just missed one shot, and that's the tough thing on this golf course. We've seen it actually -- I've never seen guys play so well then all of a sudden have one bad hole and then another bad hole, and it's not even holes, it's one shot. It's really one of the more one-shot penalizing golf courses I've ever seen.   
 I knew the round wasn't over because obviously you go through that first stretch, you can make some birdies. So I kind of just confirmed with myself that I'm hitting it good and don't need to worry about the eighth hole. It was nice to hit it close on 10, make the putt on 11 and then played well from there.  
  
  Q. What kind of confidence boost does it give you heading into tomorrow to get back to even par?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I feel good. The game has been good for a while, I just haven't been able to put it together, and today I kind of adjusted my attitude about things and didn't let the eighth hole bother me and just tried to play golf. I'm doing a lot of things well, and I have to recognize that and allow that to happen.
