 Q.   Tell me about that eagle out at 13.   
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, it was playing like a short hole today, downwind, back pin, and hit it‑‑ we knew we had a little bank to the left that could slow the ball down, and came out just a little more left than we thought, but it hit and rolled and tracked in like a putt, so it was a nice eagle.  
   
 Q.   The course got tricky on the way home, too.   Did those greens start to bake out a little?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, the greens were really tricky.   The wind was really tricky today.   Trying to chip it around the greens was really difficult.   A really good test today.   You really had to golf your ball.
