 Q.   Just get some comments on the round.   Not a great start for you, but a couple birdie on the back nine helped out a lot.   
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, it was playing tough out there.   The south wind, playing Monterey is pretty brutal.   There was six holes directly into your fairways and it was tough.   You had to hit a really ‑‑ well you had to hit a perfect shot to hit the green, let alone hit it anywhere close to the hole.   So, just battled through it, keep your head up, keep going.   I made some putts near the end and kept myself in the ball game.   
   
 Q.   T‑4 last week, talk a little bit about your confidence level right now and state of your game.   It's obviously really good?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, things are getting better.   I feel comfortable with each part of my game.   I know it and I understand what I need to do to hit each shot and executing pretty well right now and just have to keep my head up and keep trusting what I can do.  
   
 Q.   And still a little bit of golf to play out there, but if for some reason you stayed where it was right now and in that final group, what would that mean to be in the final pairing on Pebble on Sunday?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, it would be good.   I've been up there before, but not in the final group.   It would be good to kind of relax there and kind of see what you have to do.   There's some good holes where you can be aggressive and take some chances and it's a great course to play.   It's really fun, a lot can happen on it, so I think I'll have a chance tomorrow, I just got to play really good tomorrow.
