Q.   Hunter, 7 & 6 win over Stephen Gallacher, five birdies on the card.   What did you do particularly well today?
    HUNTER MAHAN:   Well, I hit great irons and rolled in some really good putts.   The greens are at a speed that I can be really aggressive, getting the lines right and trusting that.   It was a combo of I played well and he didn't have his best stuff.

Q.   How much do you love match play?   You're a past champion in this event?
    HUNTER MAHAN:   It's a lot of fun.   The next shot is only what you're worrying about.   You're trying to beat the guy next to you.   You don't have to worry too much out there.   You're worrying about the next one and trying to beat the guy.

Q.   You know how long a week can be out there?
    HUNTER MAHAN:   There's going to be a lot of golf, especially at the end of the week.   Keeping yourself fresh, not overworking yourself too much mentally, and going to the next shot and trying to hit that one good.

Q.   What do you think you need to do well on this golf course to be successful at it?
    HUNTER MAHAN:   You've got to get it off the tee pretty well.   You can hit it in the trees and not have much left.   You don't want to be chipping in on these, and trying to get up and down, these guys are too good.   If you put the ball in play, you can be aggressive on your second shot.   And like I said, the greens aren't running real fast, so you can be aggressive.
