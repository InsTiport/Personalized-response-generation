   Mahan birdied four of his last five holes, including the last three (front nine)...
 Birdies on holes 17 and 18... 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Well the tees were up on 17 and that's a tough pin, but I hit two good shots there and hit three good shots on 18. It was a steal to get two birdies there.

 Birdies to finish on 7, 8 and 9... 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Those are birdie holes, 7 and 8 and I just two good shots on nine. It was great. I just played well all day. We had great conditions and the course is just perfect. It's playing hard and fast and if you hit some good drives, you can have some short irons into the holes. The rough is down, but there's enough there to where the ball just sits a little funny.
 I've felt like my game has been pretty good all year, I just haven't scored as well as I would have liked. Things are coming around pretty good. I feel like I now making some putts. It's nice to get through that first major pretty well and get it going.
 I feel confident in what I'm doing and I know what the misses are. I feel confident in what I need to do to play well. I feel very excited to go out there and play even round.
