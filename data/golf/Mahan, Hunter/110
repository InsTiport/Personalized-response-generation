Q.   Hunter, 7‑under par 65, you've got to be happy.   You drove the ball really nice. 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, I drove it really nice.   Luckily out here you put the ball in play and you can be aggressive because the greens are soft and they're rolling pretty true.

Q.   Tell me about the distance to the greens?   It looked like there was a little bit of an adjustment.   Were these greens on the North course a little slower than what you played yesterday on the South?
HUNTER MAHAN:   Probably a little.   They're kind of drying out, so they're getting a little bit of a hop but still rolling pretty true.   But definitely you have to be aggressive because you either putt from up front or putt way back.

Q.   Talk about going into the weekend at 10‑under par? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   I feel good.   I'm excited the way I'm hitting it.   Driving is going to be more important on the South side, and I think that's going to be a strength of mine.   If I can hit a lot of fairways and greens, I think I'll have a good chance.
