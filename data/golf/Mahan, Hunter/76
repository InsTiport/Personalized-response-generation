 Q.   The last man to beat you in this championship was Martin Kaymer.   You dispatched him today.   How sweet is revenge?   
HUNTER MAHAN:   Well, I didn't know that until you just told me, but I played great today, hit a lot of good quality shots and got off to a good start and got a good lead early.   I just played some great golf today.  
   
 Q.   Last time you were behind in any match in this championship was the 6th hole of round 1 last year, 133 holes.   How much does that help with stressâ€‘free golf?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   Well, it's strange, I've always gotten off to good starts and get some leads and been hitting it well.   If you hit fairways and greens, you know you're going to put pressure on your guy.   It's definitely nice to get a lead and that's the goal for everybody, but to do it, it's a good feeling for sure.  
   
 Q.   Is there a secret to getting off to a fast start?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   No.   I mean, just hitting good shots.   No secrets.   I think some of it's luck, too, to get off to that good of a start that many times.
