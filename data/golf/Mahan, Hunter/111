 Q. First point on the board for the American Team, what does this do for you to come here and play this well? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Well, it feels good. Any time you make a team, you want to validate yourself on the team. This is my fifth one, so I feel like I have a good understanding of what it takes to play well in these things and have a good mind-set. My mind was right for this week. I played well, I had good partners and got a little lucky today. 

 Q. No partner today and playing against a tough opponent, because Jason Day had something to prove; what was it like playing out there against somebody from Australia? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: It was special. These fans are awesome. They were having a great time out there. Almost not just playing Jason, playing the crowd, too, it felt like. 
 I knew it was going to be tough. Especially with the conditions and where those pins are, it's difficult.
