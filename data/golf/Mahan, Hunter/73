 Q.   You got off to that hot start and made a little up‑and‑down on the back nine.   
HUNTER MAHAN:   This golf course, if you don't hit good quality shots‑‑ didn't do that the last couple of holes, but made the birdies I did, I feel pretty good about that.  
   
 Q.   And nine birdies out there, you had it going pretty good for the most part?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   I hit it great almost all day.   Made the putts, and that makes the score‑‑ the greens are rolling so good.   
   
 Q.   You like the World Golf Championships, you play particularly well in them, any reason why?   
HUNTER MAHAN:   I like the course, feels great and it's a good time of the year for these events, as well.   Having an opportunity to play in this event, maybe your focus is good but I enjoy those golf courses and I learn every time I get out here.
