Q.   Hunter, no surprise to see you continue to do well here.   How would you assess your performance and advancing to Thursday?
HUNTER MAHAN:   It was solid.   I didn't give him many holes.   I made a couple of nice up‑and‑downs early in the round and got lucky.   He had some opportunities to go two or even three up after four or five holes.   Kind of road the ship and then played some really solid holes on the back nine and was able to get a victory.

Q.   What have you figured out in this championship a lot better than most others?
HUNTER MAHAN:   I don't know if I figured out anything.   I think I enjoy playing here.   I love this golf course.   I put the ball in play a lot.   I don't make too many bogeys around here, not too many three putts.   These greens are pretty tricky and tough.   And not giving holes away is a big key.
