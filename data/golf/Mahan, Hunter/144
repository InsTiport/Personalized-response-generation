   ZACH JOHNSON: Certainly we got off to a great start. You know, finished our first session and second session pretty well I thought. But, you know, obviously the momentum has shifted a little bit. So we have got some work to do tomorrow. 

 Q. How long was today? 
 ZACH JOHNSON: I'm not sure what day it is. It's been a very long day. It's been a long day. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: It looks like obviously right now, they have the momentum, so this break couldn't come at a better time. 

 Q. Did it feel good to finally get out there and play? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: It did, definitely. Especially when they altered the format so we can get out there and play, which is the best thing to do and it's great for The Ryder Cup and great for all of the fans, and good to get out there and start playing.
