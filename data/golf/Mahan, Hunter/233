Q.
First time playing at THE PLAYERS Championship, great start, 68.  Talk about your day today.
HUNTER MAHAN:  Yeah, it was a great day and great weather for once this week.  Yeah, I played solid, kept the ball in the fairway, kept it on the greens and rolled some good putts.
Q.
What were your expectations coming out here this week?  It's a pretty solid rated venue, and I'm sure you watched it on TV growing up.  Just talk about your expectations today.
HUNTER MAHAN:  Well, I really like the golf course.  It's a really great track, it's in unbelievable condition right now.  You know, I definitely have high expectations for this week.  I feel really good about my game and what I can do.  This golf course I think suits me pretty well.
Q.
What holes did you do well on today?
HUNTER MAHAN:  I birdied four in a row on the front starting on like 3.  I think 3, 4, 5 and 6 I birdied.  A nice way to kind of finish the round.  To make birdies out here, you're going to have to do that with the conditions so nice, so I was happy to do that.
Q.
What did you do at 17?
HUNTER MAHAN:  Made a par, hit it on the green.  It's a little tough with that wind kind of blowing the way it was.  It was a tough yardage for me.  I was right in between clubs, so happy to get a par and get out of there.
