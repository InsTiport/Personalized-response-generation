Q.   Hunter you hit the ball awfully well today.   16 of 18 greens, 6 birdies, no bogeys. 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, that was probably the key today.   I hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.   Made a great par save on 11, which was nice.   And birdied the next hole.   It was a solid round.

Q.   What's your goal going into Chicago?   What do you want to get accomplished this week?
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, I think rhythm.   I think I want to find rhythm in my game and how I play.   And I want to find rhythm in my golf swing, and just keep that kind of flow right now. 
It's been off and on the last couple of weeks.   So I'm going to try to find some consistency there.

Q.   Staying away from all the numbers and the points?
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, I can only control basically where I am, what club I pick, that's what I can control.
