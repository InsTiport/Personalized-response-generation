  Q. Talk about the match, ended early.   
 DAVID TOMS: We got off to a really good start, we birdied the first three holes and that always helps to settle your nerves and everything.  
 We just kept the pressure on them. Didn't make many mistakes, the one hole that they won, we 3-putted. So for the most part, we just played our games, hit a lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens and just let them make mistakes after we got up early.   
 And then we made a couple of nice birdies there to finish it up, but it was a lot of fun. Obviously it's going to be hard-fought matches throughout and to get a point any time you can and help your team, that's what we are trying to do.  
  
  Q. And you didn't let up too much, you birdied the first three holes and got off to a lead. Sometimes if you let them back into the match you wind up losing, but you kept it together.   
 DAVID TOMS: We just played solid.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, we are a very good team. We are similar in our games, our attitudes, the way we go about our business. It made it easy and enjoyable out there. There was no really -- I don't think, it was easy to be around one another. We didn't have to adjust at all. Like he said, hit a lot of good shots, put the ball in play. I always felt like we were ahead in the holes, even though we were never behind, to try and catch up and make a save.   
 It was nice, first match of the week to, get off to a start like that feels good.
