Q.   Take us through your round today. 
HUNTER MAHAN:   I got off to a good start.   I hit it really, really good today.   Just had a couple silly bogeys, but I hit it great.   Just have to find a way to make some putts.

Q.   How are you finding the course changes since 2008? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   They look good.   They are pretty subtle.   Probably just redid the greens and stuff.   The course is in great shape this week.   Everything about it is great.   It's very scorable, but still challenging.   So it's a really fun, fun golf course to play. 

Q.   How are the crowds and everything, enthusiastic? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, since we finished on the front nine, there was not many people out there.   But obviously coming up, kind of playing through 18 and kind of 12 and 13 and 16, 17, it's a great arena for golf and a great‑‑ it will be a great finish on Sunday.
