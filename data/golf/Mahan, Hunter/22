 Q.  Seemed like you were playing uphill the whole time?  HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, we didn't get off to a good start.  I didn't put ourselves in a good position.  Then we fought back and played hard, but they didn't give us any openings.  Was able to make a few putts, we thought we could track it in, but they played really well.   Q.  Can you put your finger on why foursomes has been a tough task for you guys over last few days?  HUNTER MAHAN: They played well over the last couple of holes, made a couple of bombs on us, and they just found a way to grab a half here there.  So that's kind of been the determining factor
