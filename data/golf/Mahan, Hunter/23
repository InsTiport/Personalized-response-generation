Q. Can you speak to how neck and neck it was?HUNTER MAHAN: We played good.  We just didn't make any putts at the end of the day.  They made two couple of bombs on us.  They got the momentum earlier.  We played really well, just kind of killed ourselves in the end.Q. Great bunker shot you hit on this hole?HUNTER MAHAN: We got unlucky there, kind of plugged, kind of nasty lie.  I was able to dig it out of there and keep the momentum going. Trying to stop the momentum that they have and played well, we just didn't finish it.  Got around the hole, but couldn't make it when we had a chance.Q. Seemed like you Zach gelled well?HUNTER MAHAN: We had a good time out there.  Yeah, we both played well
