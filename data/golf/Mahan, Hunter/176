  Q. Seems like you're scoring pretty good today.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Good weather. It's in perfect shape. Good greens, and good players. So it's all good for low scores.  
  
  Q. Your group, kind of everybody feeding off each other, and doing well?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, you know, those guys are good players. David Duval, and a lot of fun. We had a good group today and played well.  
  
  Q. What did you think of your round?   
 HUNTER MAHAN: It's okay. Not real pleased with my putting, so I'll try to fix that.  
  
  Q. But 5's not bad. Where do you sit after 1?   
 HUNTER MAHAN: I'm at 4.   
  
  Q. Yeah, no kidding, giving one back?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: No, scored okay. I just could have scored a lot better.  
  
  Q. Getting frustrated at the finish at 18. You weren't happy?   
 HUNTER MAHAN: No, didn't putt good. Didn't make putts. Had great looks at it, but couldn't find the speed.   
 It was okay, just hitting it too hard.  
  
  Q. The fatigue level of everything you went through. Can you hit the reset button?   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, it's fine. It's good. The last couple days we've been kind of off mentally, and just try to physically I hit a couple of good shots. I'll be good for the next couple of weeks.
