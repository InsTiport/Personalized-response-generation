 Q. What's the difference between yesterday and today? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Putts. Today I hit it pretty good, I thought I hit it a little bit better but made a few silly bogeys and just wasn't as sharp as I was yesterday. 

 Q. Yesterday you played in the morning; was there a big difference in the morning and afternoon?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Oh, no question, especially Thursday morning to Friday afternoon, it's a different golf course. The greens are definitely bouncy and firmer and definitely played tougher. 

 Q. You're still right there, though. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, a lot of golf left. A lot of golf left. 

 Q. You're right there, second place; you would have taken that at the start of the tournament?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Oh, sure. The course is only getting tougher. I love where my game is. I just have to keep playing golf. 

 Q. With all of the talk of The Ryder Cup, do you think you're making a good enough audition for Captain Azinger?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Hopefully. I'm going to try to play as good as I can and try to make the decision easy for him. You know, I've just got to play this week for this week.

 Q. Steve Stricker, the leader came in and said you've had great conditions this week, now playing all of the holes in all conditions, do you think you can shoot a better score on the weekend? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: The course is only going to get firmer and faster, the greens, they are going to get a little rough, but there are a lot of opportunities out there. You have a lot of good looks for birdie. The thing with the wind, is you can definitely get to some par 5s. You can definitely still shoot a good number.
