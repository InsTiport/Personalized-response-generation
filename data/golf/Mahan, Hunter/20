Q. Good to get a point?JIM FURYK: I feel good about it.  It was a bad taste in my mouth.  I felt like Matt and I played really well yesterday, but to lose our match there on 18 was disappointing.  So it was nice to come out with H this morning, got off to a great start, got 3-up pretty early and were able to get it going and knock in some key putts.Q. How crucial was the start in setting the tone for the day?HUNTER MAHAN: For sure.  Every time I looked on the board for the first few holes it was blue.  So we had to change that and get off to a good start, and we did.  I think we birdied the first three and got on the tee box early and kind of kept the pressure on them all day.Q. Big session for the U.S. all day, what was the message from Captain Tom heading out?JIM FURYK: Well, it's not over yet.  We are not going to count anything.  There are two matches out, I think we are 1-1 so far.  So hopefully those last two come through and it would be great if we went out 3-1 this morning it would be great. But Captain Tom, I think he was asking for a little red on the board early.  He was tired of seeing brew for the first five holes, so it was nice to got out there and get a good start.
