Q.   How do you feel about your round today?
HUNTER MAHAN:   Not very good.   Didn't hit it very good.   Drove it terrible.   Just didn't hit it very good.   Not what you're going to need to play this course well. 

Q.   Do you feel like the overnight rain had any effect? 
HUNTER MAHAN:   Much softer actually.   The course is really, really soft.   It's hard to be aggressive on the back pins because the ball is spinning back so much.   The ball wasn't bouncing off the fairways like they have been, so it's affecting the course quite a bit.
