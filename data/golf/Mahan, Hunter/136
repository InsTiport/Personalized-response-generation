  Q. Hunter, great start to the round, and then a little bit of a roller coaster there at the end. Just get some comments.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I was able to capitalize on some stuff early, just par-5s, getting it up and down, hitting it close with some wedges.   
 You know, sometimes you try hit it close on some of these pins, and, I mean, you can hit good shots and end up in bad spots.  
  
  Q. Only three guys ahead of you. Your thoughts on the weekend?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: There's a ton of guys. This tournament, like I said, is so far from over. There's all kinds of inexperience on the leaderboard right now, and a little bit of experience with Padraig up there.   
 It's going to be -- and of course playing different golf courses , so a lot holes. Should be a pretty exciting finish.   
  
  Q. And lastly, the bogey on 17, you had gotten it to 8-under and then bogeyed 17.   
 HUNTER MAHAN: Just not a great swing. My swing is kind of in and out right now, so it's kind of difficult. I think the to the right and it was a terrible lie and a terrible spot. So just depends where you hit it out here.
