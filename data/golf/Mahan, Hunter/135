   HUNTER MAHAN: Solid, played well, gave myself a chance at the end.

 Q. Early on you caught the leaders by the turn; that about where you thought you needed to get to?
 HUNTER MAHAN: I had no idea. I know I made a ton of birdies and thought it was good. The course was there for it. Had to do it.

 Q. You made everything on the front side except a couple inside ten feet but just did nothing but give yourself opportunities?
 HUNTER MAHAN: I hit it good, too, hit a lot of greens, a lot of chances, and put up a pretty good number. 

 Q. A very good number, 66. You shot 67 on Friday. You love this course, don't you?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I love coming here. It's a beautiful place. Got lucky with the weather this week. So it's a fun golf course to play when it's like this.
