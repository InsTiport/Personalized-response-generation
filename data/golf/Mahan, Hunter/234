HUNTER MAHAN:  I feel great, feel strong.
Q.  Very nice round.  Looks like you're going to be playing definitely within striking distance.  How do you feel playing into the weekend here?
HUNTER MAHAN:  I feel good.  Anything can happen on this golf course, so I feel excited to be playing.
Q.  What was the difference between yesterday's conditions and today's conditions?
HUNTER MAHAN:  Yeah, the wind definitely died down.  It's a little overcast and it's definitely warmer, too, so the scores will be lower this afternoon.
Q.  If the wind kicks up this afternoon, how do you think 5-under is going to be looking?
HUNTER MAHAN:  Good.  I think it's going to be good no matter what.

I definitely think some wind and the greens are going to firm out, but I think it's going to stay like this for a while.
Q.  The conditions right now, how would you rate them against ideal golf conditions?
HUNTER MAHAN:  About an 8.  I mean, it's overcast and the greens are a little softer right now, so that's good, and there's hardly any wind, so that's nice.
Q.  Thank you.  Congratulations.
