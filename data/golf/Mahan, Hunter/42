Q.   Hunter, continued success in this championship and apparently against Richard Sterne.   How pleased are you to move on to the next round?
HUNTER MAHAN:   I'm very pleased.   It was a tough match.   We had to grind it out on every hole.   Richard played pretty solid. 
In the end, it came down to a couple little breaks.   Luckily, I made two really good swings on 18 to close it out.

Q.   Even though it's a new year, when you know you've had success against a particular person in this championship on this course, how does that help your confidence?
HUNTER MAHAN:   I mean, you feel good about the course, but I'm sure he's extremely motivated to beat me.   I had him two times coming into today.   So I'm sure he kind of circled this and was amped for it.   And he played great. 
It was a tough match and went all the way down to 19.

Q.   Another tough one on Friday, Graeme McDowell.   Obviously you guys played a pretty epic match a few years ago.   How excited are you to get a chance to get back at him?
HUNTER MAHAN:   I mean, Graeme is a great player.   Obviously very tough.   It's going to be a battle.   It's going to be challenge.   I look forward to it.   I'm excited about the opportunity.   And I love playing in this event, so it will be fun.
