 Q. Can you talk about the round so far, what it means to be in contention here after putting up a good score here? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Well, I mean, just trying to make some birdies out here. I haven't really played that well out here. 
 Never thought about the leaderboard there, but it feels good. Looking forward to the next few days. 

 Q. Conditions were perfect in the afternoon, weren't they? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I heard it was ugly this morning, windy, and the greens were firmer, so great stuff. The greens were slower, took some getting used to, but conditions were fantastic out there. 

 Q. You said you haven't played well here before. What would you say is the difference? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: I'm just trying to be aggressive, take it to the golf course instead of the course taking it to me, just trying to go out there and play to my strengths and be aggressive, try to make birdies, play golf. You know, play like I know how I can play. 

 Q. Obviously a win is a win, but a win at home in front of all your people, would that count as a win and a half or something for ya? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: It would be nice. I mean, it's fun to have family and friends here. It would be great to win at home.
