 Q. Hunter, just your thoughts on your round today. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: It was steady. You know, I played pretty solid.

 Q. Did you have chances you left out there?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I mean, I hit it in the water on 13 and just made a good par there and moved on there. But I played pretty solid. I gave myself some good looks, just didn't quite get enough momentum going. But I'm pretty happy with the way I played.

 Q. I know you're focused on what you're doing, but you must have heard all the roars. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: It was great. It was exciting. It was awesome. This is what you want when you come out here, just to hear the roars and the birdies and the eagles and the balls in the water. That's what you want.

 Q. Do you do any scoreboard watching, fan type stuff during the round?
 HUNTER MAHAN: For sure. I'm playing to play good, but there's a lot of free time out there, so hearing the roars, it's exciting. It's fun to be a part of this event.

 Q. You're probably going to go watch the end of this. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: I'm going straight to the airport. I've got a 7:00 flight so I'm just trying to make that right now. But Kenny just birdied. This course is really good for him. I expect him to play well down the stretch here.

 Q. Do you think he can hang in there?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Absolutely, absolutely. He's played the best golf the last couple years of anybody, so he's playing good.
