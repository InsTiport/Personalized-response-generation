 Q.   Kuch conceded that last hole, but you've played awfully well so this last week?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   Yeah, playing solid.   Just not giving holes away, try to put theball in play.   Hit a lot of greens, try to put pressure on my opponents as best I can.  
   
 Q.   Obviously weather a little different today.   How did it affect play out there?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   It's still pretty good.   The wind may have picked up a little bit, the fog, got a little colder but it didn't affect the play too much.   It is match play so you've just got to worry about your match play.
