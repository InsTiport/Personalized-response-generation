 Q. Hunter, 7-under today, nice playing. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Thanks, appreciate it.

 Q. And you got in right before the horn blew. How nice was that?
 HUNTER MAHAN: That was one of the greatest things ever. I mean, to walk in, go into the trailer and to hear the horn blow --

 Q. What were you happiest with today? What was going on?
 HUNTER MAHAN: I kind of hung in there on the back nine, and then the weather -- it was perfect all day. The course was perfect, perfect scoring conditions, and everyone was going on. I made an eagle on 4, and that's kind of what got my momentum back and going it rolling and made some good putts down the stretch.

 Q. And Furyk is at 5-under in your group, too. Were you guys feeding off each other a little bit?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, Bubba shot 4-under, Jim shot 5-under, so it was a great group of guys. Everyone played well, and it was fun.

 Q. What's the plan now? The horn blew, you're done for the day. Who knows when you're going to get back on the golf course. How many movies can you go see in one day, day and a half?
 HUNTER MAHAN: I don't know, I'm going to find out, that's for sure. Luckily I'm staying right by a mall. 

 Q. Talk about your round. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I played well, gave myself a lot of good looks today, and it's perfect conditions, so you're going to have to make some birdies.

 Q. Are you surprised you guys played ball in hand this morning? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, it's just precautionary with the weather and everything. You don't want the guys in the afternoon to have to play mud balls and play in bad conditions. They were just trying to even it up. 

 Q. What was the best part of your game today?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Irons were solid, hit a lot of greens, gave myself a lot of good looks.
