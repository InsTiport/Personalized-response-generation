   HUNTER MAHAN: I hit it great on 12. I had a good -- I had great looks on 8 and 11 but couldn't make them. Nervous to make that swing -- bad swing on 17, set me up, had no shot to the green.   
 Just didn't make good swings and made some bad putts.   
  
  Q. Is it a momentum thing where it was going badly, or just one of those days?  
 HUNTER MAHAN: It's just, you know -- out here, you hit it in the wrong kind of place, you have a terrible angle to the hole and in the bermudarough, you can get a good lie or a bad lie.
