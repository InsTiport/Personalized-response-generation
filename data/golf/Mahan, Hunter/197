 Q. Talk about playing your first Ryder Cup and playing with Justin. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Looking forward to it. Justin is obviously a veteran at these, so it's going to be great to play with him and have that experience. He's got a great demeanor on the course and I'm going to be able to feed off of that. Being able to go out there in the morning is going to be nice.

 Q. Have you looked at who you are playing against or is that a concern for you?
 HUNTER MAHAN: No, I'm concerned about us and myself personally. Who we play is not a problem. We just have to go out there and handle our business, and hopefully the chips fall in our favour. 

 Q. And the course, having played it for the last couple of days, what do you think? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: It's great. It's matured really nicely, and I played here last Thursday and it's gotten a lot better since then so, that's great to see. The greens are going to be fantastic. It's going to be a great test and I think everybody is excited about this venue.

 Q. Any nerves, getting up on that first tee of any event, probably a little bit of nerves?
 HUNTER MAHAN: We'll see. I can't tell you tell I'm there but I'm looking forward to it. The Presidents Cup last year was great and I learned a lot from that experience and being able to put it into this experience, and hopefully take it to this week and play well.
