 Q.   Talk about your round.   
HUNTER MAHAN:   I made a little late rally there and got myself in contention there.   It felt good.   Felt nice to kind of feel those nerves and excitement and energy.   
Just a shot short maybe, I don't know, maybe two.   I played solid and happy with how I played.  
   
 Q.   I'd love to know, obviously the pressure of playing in a final group in a major championship is incredible.   What does it feel like in comparison here at these final few holes and all the crowds?  
HUNTER MAHAN:   Oh, yeah.   I mean, it's right up there.   You're trying to win a tournament no matter where you're playing.  
It's exciting, it's nerveâ€‘wracking, you don't want to put yourself in a bad spot.   You know, I felt like I handled it really well, made a lot of great swings when I had to.  
I think everything was solid.   I just didn't play as well as I needed to.
