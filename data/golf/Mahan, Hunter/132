  HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, there was nothing pretty about it. We really didn't play very good. But I did hit some good shots coming down the stretch. I wish I could have made it a little easier, but I finished well and I'm going to take that for tomorrow. 

 Q. Gutsy birdie at 15. That was a birdie putt that you very much made. And that was so well done, what kind of confidence does that give you moving forward?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, he hit an incredible drive up to 4 feet. And I hit it solid and just that hole kind of grabbed him luckily. And that was a big turning point for me for the match.

 Q. Your tee shot on 16. Very aggressive line, and very well executed?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Probably the best one I made all day. A good 5-iron and had a good putt. Luckily got a win there. 

 Q. You were behind for the majority of the time, how does it feel to come out on top?
 HUNTER MAHAN: It feels good. I gutted it out and made a few good shots at the end. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 HUNTER MAHAN: No question. He hit an incredible shot in there. I just tried to make birdie, and hoped for the best.

 Q. Did you come into this week thinking it could be a big one?
 HUNTER MAHAN: You know, I really didn't know. Fifth week in a row, so I didn't know how my energy level was. But actually I feel pretty good. 
 It's match play, so you can focus on one shot at a time and gut out one hole at a time. 

 Q. Some of the American announcers predicted a big year for Hunter Mahan, is that how it feels for you?
 HUNTER MAHAN: I feel good, I feel like I'm improving in every area. I feel my short game is better. I could hopefully save myself a few shots a round and hopefully it will be something special this year.
