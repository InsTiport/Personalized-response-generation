 Q. You kind of dominate. How good does it feel to know that you are making the turn and you're already in full control? 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I hit fairways, hit greens, gave myself some looks. Sean didn't have it for the first nine or ten holes there. He gave me a few holes. But I played solid throughout.

 Q. How different do you play strategically when you're 4-up versus all square?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Not too much until you figure out where the pin and where your playing putter is. But I had to keep playing.

 Q. How happy are you with your swing, your putting, your short game, the whole package?
 HUNTER MAHAN: It feels good. It feels pretty good right now. These greens, they're pretty grainy right now, and obviously there's so much slope on them. Every putt kind of has a lap. So you have to pay attention out there. 

 Q. Talk about maybe a few key shots in the round, a few key holes in the round. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: I just -- obviously I got off to a good lead there. I birdied 9, which is nice. I hit two good shots there. And got up a nice lead there. But I think it was probably -- making the putt kind of on 14, if I missed that, he makes that and goes to the FedExCup hole, he's got some momentum coming in. That was great to be the first one to make it and he had to make it and go dormie.

 Q. Between this tournament you've had experience in, the Presidents Cups, the Ryder Cups, are you getting used to match play, are you figuring it out a little bit?
 HUNTER MAHAN: It's only twice a year, it's pretty simple. You have to play good. You have to beat the guy in front of you. There's no unbelievable extra strategy involved in it. You've got to be good, better than the guy you're playing.
