  Q.  What a great match, back and forth.  If you have to lose, I guess to go out swinging is the way to do it.   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  I knew it was going to be a tough match.  He's a good player.  I had a tough one yesterday, but I knew he played well.  I was behind all day, and I was kind of battling, because he put it on me early.  I'm happy with the way I played, I just couldn't get over the hump.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the putt at 18 that sent it to extra holes.  You didn't come away with a victory, but your game is standing up under pressure?   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  For sure.  I didn't know how close it was.  I didn't know it was that close.  It gave me a squirrelly lie in the fairway there.  When I saw the ball, I knew I was definitely going to -- it was definitely a makeable putt; I just had to put a good stroke on it.  And I put a good one on it and it went right in the middle, so that was nice.   
  
  Q.  It seemed like you guys were having fun.   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  Yeah, I like Steve a lot.  He's someone I look up to, for sure.  We were just playing golf out there.  We weren't trying to kill each other.  We were just trying to play good, solid golf.  At the end we didn't talk as much, but that's understandable.
