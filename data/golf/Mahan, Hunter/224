  Q.  Assuming you get into the British Open, it's a nice accomplishment for you, not only getting a win, but being able to get into the British would be nice?   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  I love the British.  Any time you can play in a major, it's good, get a little bet of experience.  I love the British, I've been there two years, it's a ton of fun, golf in it's pure form and it's a lot of fun.   
  
  Q.  Do you know anything about Carnoustie or just what you've seen on TV?   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  No, just kind of what I've seen on TV a little bit.  I know very little about it.  I'm going in there pretty fresh and have to come up with a game plan Monday through Wednesday.   
  
  Q.  You have a week off, just go home and chill and practice?   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  Yeah, I'm going to hang out for a little bit.  I'm going to play four in a row, so get some rest and kind of get ready for the British as best I can.   
  
  Q.  What is a typical travel schedule, you go overseas and get there a couple of days early?   
 HUNTER MAHAN:  I'm going to leave Saturday, get there kind of Sunday afternoon.   
 I played pretty good at the British just getting there when I get there.  So I'm not too concerned about getting acclimated.  I think that's just a little overrated, so I'll get there when I get there.
