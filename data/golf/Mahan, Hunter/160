 Q. Just a couple comments on what might be the round of the day today, 6-under 65. 
 HUNTER MAHAN: Well, I got lucky with a tee time, really. Started on the back, there were expectations of high, high wind, and for about 15, 16 holes we didn't really have much. Got through the turn and played it solid and played pretty well all day.

 Q. This is your fourth or fifth tournament. Are you disappointed in your start? Or are you not worried about it too much?
 HUNTER MAHAN: Yeah, I'm a little disappointed, but I'm doing the right things. I'm getting better. The whole of my game is actually really good, so that's kind of exciting.
