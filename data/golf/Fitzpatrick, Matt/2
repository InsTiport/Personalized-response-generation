 Q.  An opening 69, 5-under, how was that?  
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was great, obviously.  Not the ideal start.  I started on 10, and 2-over through four I think.  Then got it back together and realised in the scorer's hut, it was five birdies in a row from 16 to 2.  So yeah, it was great.   
 Q.  What was the change that came about there?  
MATT FITZPATRICK: I knew I had to stay patient.  I really love playing this golf course.  Suits my eye well.  Played a really great pitch on the par 5, 14.  That just sort of got my round going, basically.   
 Q.  Tough conditions with an unusual wind this week.  
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, absolutely.  It is a strange wind.  I don't remember it.  Some holes are playing quite short today, and it's a strong wind today.  Hope it stays the same and shoot the same scores the next three days, I'll be all right.  But yeah, it was good.
