  Q. Stephanie, nice 4-under to start the 2021 Kia Classic.  Take us through the round and maybe how the wind maybe affected both nines out there today.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, definitely picked up on the back.  I got off -- I mean, I birdied 1, which is always nice, but kind of bounced back with a bogey on 2.  But then I hd three in a row 6, 7, and 8.  Was able to get to 8 in two today which was a nice two-putt birdie, which was nice.
 And, yeah, just kind of really solid on the back.  Gave myself some opportunities.  The wind definitely is a big factor here.
 Q. Is there one nine that's maybe more scorable in the practice rounds that you thought to yourself, This is where I can do some damage?
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   I think it always depends on setup, to be honest.  Like when they have 8 up today obviously that is a big help, but I think in general the back might be a tiny bit harder, yeah.
 Q. You played this event in 2019 and started off 5-under there.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah.  Yeah, I did.
 Q. What's is about Aviara and hot starts for Stephanie Meadow?
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, hopefully I don't finish like did I '19.  I like this golf course.  I feel like if you hit good golf shots you'll be rewarded, and if you don't hit it in the fairway it's really penalizing here, so that kind of plays into the strength of my game.
 It's a pretty walk, it's a gorgeous golf course, and it's just easy to be happy out there I think.
 Q. How nice is it to have this event back on the schedule after a year off, just to have the Kia Classic back, Aviara back?
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, it's great.  I live in Phoenix so I can drive here.  I love this California swing.  Very thankful that we can have it this year and we're past that.
 Q. There was one other I had for you.  Can't think of it.  Oh, Kyle.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Oh, Kyle.
 Q. You guys have had a few events under your belt now.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah.
 Q. He was on the bag on the Symetra Tour.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah.
 Q. But out a little different game.  How nice has it been?
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   It's been really nice.  It's been a great change, and I really just enjoy -- like I can be so open and tell him exactly how I'm feeling and he kind of like knows what to say and what not to say for the most part.
 So far it's been a great team and I'm just enjoying having someone really have my back.  Obviously normal caddies do, too, but he's got a little more skin in the game I guess.
