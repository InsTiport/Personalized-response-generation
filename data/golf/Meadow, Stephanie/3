  Q. All right, Steph, I feel like you been fighting this whole round.  You fought yesterday and now you fought to here.  Still what a great finish for you this week.  What are your thoughts as you exit the course?
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, really pleased.  Scared myself a little bit on 18 there.  Rounded a putt by but made it and finished solo third.  I think that tee is my best finish ever.
 Yeah, really pleased, and I think just a lot of hard work paying off.  Obviously it's important to thank everyone that's gotten me here.  It's not just me.  There is a huge team behind me.  My fiance, Kyle my coaches, Terry, Debby, my sports psych that's amazing.
 Q. This does tie your career-best finish.  What does that mean to you about how far you've been able to come to get to this point?
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, it's been a long journey but a great one.  You learn so much about yourself.  Golf is one of those things where you always feel like you can do better, but I'm pretty satisfied where I'm right now.
 Q. What does that say about your game as we go into the three-week stretch here?  I think your goal is going to be to get to CME Group Tour Championship.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah.
 Q. What are your thoughts as we close out the season over the next three weeks?
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, just build momentum now.  Sometimes you get the confidence and you know you can do it, and you just have to keep the pedal to the metal basically; no letting up.
 Just have a nice week at Thanksgiving next week and back on the grind.  I was third reserve for Texas, so top 10 gets me in.  There you go.  Don't have to worry about that anymore.
 Q. What does it mean for you knowing that you'll be able to compete after Thanksgiving, just another event to notch under your belt, especially after how well you've done here?
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, gosh, at one point in the year I didn't know if I was going to get in this event.  Things have been so fluctuating.  So to think your season is over and now until March or end of February, and then all of a sudden you get two more at least, which is great.
