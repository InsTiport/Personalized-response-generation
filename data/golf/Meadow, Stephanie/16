 Q. Even par, within striking distance at least through 16, you have to feel pretty good about your spot right now?STEPHANIE MEADOW: Yeah, absolutely.  I'm just focusing on one shot at a time, trying to do the best.  You have to be patient out there.  You hit some great shots and you're going to be in some terrible places with some great shots even.  So patience is really key.
Q. Playing in the heat, trying to play a challenging course at the same time, what's the key to keeping your composure, as well as the patience that you talked about?STEPHANIE MEADOW: I think just knowing that you're going to get good breaks, as well as bad breaks.  You're going to hit bad shots and they might bounce into something, but the other thing is everybody else is having to deal with it, too.  Everyone is hot, everyone's going to get bad breaks, so you just have to deal with it.
Q. Final question, it would be nice to be able to finish this round, because you got to go to bed early anyway.  Now you got to go to bed even earlier.STEPHANIE MEADOW: Yeah.
Q. What's the added pressure or what, is there any difficulty in this at all?STEPHANIE MEADOW: No, to be honest, I mean, done for the day, I can sleep, I'm going to get up early anyway, so it's not too bad.  Most people, if you get a good rest then you'll be ready to go even fresher for the last two holes tomorrow.
Q. Does it mess up any routine you may have had for tomorrow?STEPHANIE MEADOW: No, not really.  I've been in these situations before, you need a full warm-up just do your normal thing and just treat it as you're playing 20 holes instead of 18.
