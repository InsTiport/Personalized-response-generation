Q. Talk about how you played today.
STEPHANIE MEADOW: Yeah, it was great.  Three birdies in a row coming in there.  I started off great and then kind of had a little lull in the middle, but I hung in there.  That's what golf is about, you just keep fighting and hope for the best score at the end.
Q. Likely in that penultimate group tomorrow; what's going to be the approach going into that?
STEPHANIE MEADOW: No different than what I've been doing.  I feel pretty comfortable right now.  I know it's been a while since I've been up here, but I still feel comfortable.  I have confidence in myself, and I think I have a really good game plan for this golf course, and I'm just going to stick to it no matter what.
Q. What are the keys to this golf course for having success out here?
STEPHANIE MEADOW: Hitting fairways is key.  The rough is pretty penal, especially with the greens being so firm, so if you can hit the fairways there's a lot of wedges into holes here, and if you can kind of dial in your yardages, you're going to make some birdies.
Q. What do you look back on to give you the confidence to go out there and put a good round together tomorrow?
STEPHANIE MEADOW: Yeah, U.S. Open was obviously my first time that I was really up there, and I handled that really well, and I know I can handle that pressure.  I think that's what I work for, and I kind of thrive on it.  It's a great position to be in, and there's no point in being scared, you're just here, and it's fun.
