  THE MODERATOR:   Nice round of 69 today, nice little bounce back from yesterday.  Tell us how you played today.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, really solid, bogey-free, so that was nice, especially out there.  But yeah, a lot to make up for from yesterday, and I'm not quite sure it's enough.  You know, end on a good note, but obviously yesterday kind of killed me.
 THE MODERATOR:   It was a bogey-free round with one birdie, but that's all you need on a day like this.  What was the change from yesterday to today for you do you think.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Definitely had better speed on the greens.  Had quite a few three-putts yesterday, and honestly I just hit the ball really solid.  I think it played a little easier today.  The wind is not quite as up as it was yesterday, although it was pretty chilly this morning.  Overall just better ball-striking and better putting.  Pretty much everything -- after 8-over, pretty much everything gets better.
 THE MODERATOR:   You've done what you could do today and now we sit and see what the field does.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   We'll see.
 Q. I was just wondering how much it would mean to you to get in for the weekend because obviously it clicked for you today.  It would be nice to have another two rounds.
 STEPHANIE MEADOW:   Yeah, definitely.  I haven't had a chance really to look at the leaderboard yet, but if I do get in, it would be fabulous.  Obviously my game is in pretty good shape, and I think 8-over yesterday was kind of an anomaly.  Yeah, it would be very nice to make the weekend.
