   MIKE SCANLAN: Can we go through your card? Started birdie on 2.   
 SOO-YUN KANG: I'm on the green for the second shot. I'm not sure for the feet, but I'm sure for the yards, maybe five yards.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: So 15 feet?   
 SOO-YUN KANG: Yeah.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Okay. Birdie 5.  
 SOO-YUN KANG: Yeah. Maybe two feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Did you two-putt?   
 SOO-YUN KANG: One-putt.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: One-putt for birdie. What was it you hit in? A wedge?   
 SOO-YUN KANG: Yeah. One yard short of the green and then chip in and then two feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Got it. Birdie on 11, the par-3.  
 SOO-YUN KANG: I hit the 7-iron, maybe 20 feet, made putt.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: 12.  
 SOO-YUN KANG: 12, hit a pitching wedge and then chip in.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Okay. 14.  
 SOO-YUN KANG: 14, hit the pitching wedge and then maybe six, made putt.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: 16.  
 SOO-YUN KANG: 16, hit the sand wedge and then six feet.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: And 18.  
 SOO-YUN KANG: 18, 9-iron, maybe six feet, made that putt.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: All right, Soo-Yun, nice round.  
 SOO-YUN KANG: Thank you.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: 7-under par. Right now you're tied for the lead in the clubhouse. If you would, just talk about your day and how you played.   
 SOO-YUN KANG: I'm so happy today. My shot is pretty good. Still missed a few fairways and greens, but still, I have good feeling for putting, if everything make it.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Okay. Questions?   
  
  Q. Is this your best round so far this season?  
 SOO-YUN KANG: Yes.   
  
  Q. And just talk about your thoughts on you talked about putting. What were some of the reasons you were putting so well today?  
 SOO-YUN KANG: The putting felt so good. Sometimes the putting is good, sometimes shot is good, didn't match, but this time, it matched everything and made the course good.   
  
  Q. You're on the list of the players at the moment who are tied for the lead at 7-under. It's a pretty clouty field here, the top 28 of the 30 players. Do you think the scores being as low as they are is just sort of a reflection of how good the field is?  
 SOO-YUN KANG: I think the condition is too good right now, with the green and fairway. Every year we have the rain here, but nothing rained and greens perfect.   
 Wind is not much. The weather is good. It makes scores good.   
  
  Q. So this is as good as the course has ever been when you've played here in the past?  
 SOO-YUN KANG: We have a few more good conditions, but this is a little bit shorter than that course, which makes it good for the low score.   
  
  Q. So far the people I see on the leaderboard are people that haven't won before. Now, you have a victory. Will that possibly help a little bit where in a lot of tournaments, first-round leaders are nowhere to be seen later in the week where this is just still the first round and you know you still gotta go through three more to get the repeat, you know, a victory.   
 SOO-YUN KANG: Yeah. I think so. First round is pretty good for going to the victory, the winning. It more makes them comfortable and more feeling to go for it, and then mine is more like relaxed going into the rest of the rounds as the leader from the first day.   
  
  Q. I didn't have a chance to look up to see how you performed here before. Have you done well here in the past? Is this a course you're comfortable with?  
 SOO-YUN KANG: Yeah. This course is -- I'm not sure whether I finished in Top 10 one year and then a few times I missed the cut and a few times I make the cut.   
 But I like this course too much, and sometimes if I didn't make the putt, I miss the cut. Everybody do that. But I love this course.   
  
MIKE SCANLAN: Soo-Yun, thank you so much.   
 SOO-YUN KANG: You're welcome.
