Q. Excellent round today.  How was it out there for you?
TREVOR FISHER JNR: It was good, found a bit of rhythm and started hitting a bit of good shots.  It's always easier to putt a score together when you're hitting your irons better and your driver is obviously in the fairway.  It was good.  I played solid today.
Q. What is the course playing like?
TREVOR FISHER JNR: The course is a bit easy, but much different to last year.  Last year it was quite thicker.  If you missed the fairways you had to hack it out and you couldn't hit the greens sometimes.
But yeah, it is playing a bit more forgiving this year, but it's still fun and you've still got to putt the ball in the hole.  It's going to be interesting.
Q. Potentially a bit of rain on the way tonight which could soften up the greens.  So could even more be target practice tomorrow.
TREVOR FISHER JNR: Yeah, the greens are a bit soft at the moment and obviously with the field going through, they start spiking up a bit.  Obviously the surface isn't the best but that's okay, I think they have done well with what they have had here.  I don't think there's been too much rain.  But it's a good test and if it rains we'll be firing at the flags tomorrow.
Q. 123rd on the Order of Merit at the moment.  You started off well but got a big weekend ahead.
TREVOR FISHER JNR: Yeah, this is a big week for me.  I did start off pretty good.  I've been battling a back injury for quite a while now, and I just tried to play through it, which is a bit silly, but I'm a bit stubborn like that.  I'll just fight through and see what happens at the end of the week.
Q. Are you feeling positive?
TREVOR FISHER JNR: Yeah, if I hit the ball like this, I have a good chance to win.  Just stay patient, and obviously if I keep my rhythm nice, which I will be trying, I think I'll have a good chance.
