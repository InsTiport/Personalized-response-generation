Q Tell us how you feel you've performed in some of the season for us,
SAMI VÄLIMÄKI:   Yeah, really good tournament, and all year, and in little like spaces, but really good golf this year.
Q Obviously when you were coming on to the European Tour, you must have had some expectations and achievements you wanted to make.  What did you feel like you were going to get into and has the whole year lived up to your expectations?
SAMI VÄLIMÄKI:   My main goal was to take the one win, and so it was good I made almost straightaway.  But in the end, it has been a really good year, and I mean, even this virus happened, but the European Tour has made it really good that we can still play.
Q Making that achievement and win on Tour, what's it been like, being in the thick of the drama here at the DP World Tour Championship, it must have been overwhelming at times?
SAMI VÄLIMÄKI:   It was hard.  Even though you know you still have almost 13 holes to go and if you shoot low, you're going to win but if you shoot bad you're going to still be okay.
Q I know you're going to welcome the festive break that's around the corner for yourself but at the same time probably eager to come back and get it all started again?
SAMI VÄLIMÄKI:   I think so.  It's going to be a good start in Abu Dhabi.
