Q. Great Result this morning can you give me your thoughts on the match?
CORMAC SHARVIN: All positive, me and Jack both played really nicely and its probably the best I've ever played and putted I would say.   We both just got off to a great start and holed a couple of good putts on the first couple of holes and we kept capitalising, every time we made a mistake Jack or I would maybe pitch it out and make par.   It was just the dream game really.  
Q. What do you think was the key to you winning?
CORMAC SHARVIN: We play a lot together and practice a lot together so we know each other really well and know each other's games really well so we gel pretty nicely.  
Q. Do you think the conditions helped you today?
CORMAC SHARVIN: Yes I would say so, me and Jack had total control of the golf ball, I would say the guys struggled a bit with the wind.   I don?t think anyone would   have beaten us to be honest.   They would have had to have their "A" games to have the chance to take us a bit further.   They struggled a bit but I think in any conditions Jack and I would have won today
