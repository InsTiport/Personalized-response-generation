 Q.  You have been unbeaten all week, three out of three. How do you feel right now?  
 ?It feels great. It has just been an unbelievable experience. My golf game has been pretty good as well and it has been nice to get three out of three but as I said before it is a team effort and I?m just glad I could contribute to the win.?   
 Q.  The way this team has gelled this week, it has been a true team hasn?t it?  
CORMACK SHARVIN: ?It?s been great. We are all really good friends and we have been even before this week so it was just nice for everything to gel and to get the victory in the end.?   
 Q.  For the five Irish to be part of the team that is going to win and by the look of it part of a team that is going to win well, this is history for Irish golf as well as the Britain and Ireland team as well isn?t it?  
CORMACK SHARVIN: ?Exactly, it?s unbelievable history for Irish golf. It just shows the strength that we actually have in the team. And not just the strength that we have in the team. We are good golfers but the gelling we have, we are all really good mates. We talk to each other every now and again and have a drink together every now and again. We are all really good friends which makes it even better. We are all looking out for each other?s back which is nice.?   
 Q.  Eventually it will hit home that you have won a historic match and hopefully by a clear margin. How is that going to sit with you and what you have experienced as an amateur golfer?  
CORMACK SHARVIN: ?That?s by far the best experience of my life to date so far anyway. I have done some nice things in golf. I have won the Brabazon Trophy and it doesn?t even come close. It is just an unbelievable experience. I think the whole experience of playing as a team and playing for each other makes it even sweeter.?
