And I play good today, so keep going for tomorrow and the rest of the weekend.

Q.   First back‑to‑back rounds in the 60s I think on tour for you.   Did you feel this coming?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yeah, not first time.   I think I do it in Bahamas this year.   I don't remember.
But it's pretty good.   Especially today I hit good.   After like 7 when I make an eagle, I feel so stress and I keep it, so I'm happy about my round.

Q.   Were you on the green in two there on 7?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yeah, I got a lucky bounce and hit the green in two and ten feet on the pin so I made the putt. 
So it was good.

Q.   What did you hit on 7?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   3‑wood.

Q.   So when you got the birdie, you said you were a little stressed before. 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yeah, I got a birdie on No. 3.   I make like a ten‑feet putt, eagle on 17, and I make birdie on 17. 
So it was good.

Q.   So your mentality going into the weekend.   You said you're excited.   It's your first time. 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Excited.   It's not my first time, but for like a long time.   Yeah, I'm excited but a little bit stressed because I'm close to the leader, so I want to be good and maybe win the tournament.

Q.   What's your mindset going into the weekend?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Just be happy and enjoy.

Q.   What was working for you?   Was it your drives or the putting?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   My putting was good this week and my chipping was better.   I work a lot last week about my chipping, so today was better.   And yesterday.
So it was good.

Q.   Did you change anything with your chipping before?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   No, I just practice more.   So it was better. 

Q.   When you first saw this golf course, did you think, Okay, I like the way this suits my eye? 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   I play last year and I got a good memory.   So when I come this year, I say, Oh, I got a good memory and everything.   So I'm happy to be here.   I love the course.
