 Q.   Overall today maybe not the start that you wanted.   
PERRINE DELACOUR:   No, but I'm so stressed ‑‑   like I was nervous at the beginning, so my putting wasn't good.  
So I feel like so nervous.   My putting was bad, so I start putting better after like the 7 when I make birdie.   I make a good par on 8 and par on 9, and now it's better.  
I hope to keep it tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel like you were less nervous before the birdie or was it the birdie that helped you?   
PERRINE DELACOUR:   No, I think after like when I make three bogey in a row then say, Okay I'm not going to lead so I was less nervous.   I save, Okay just be patient.  
Yeah, help for my birdie.  
   
 Q.   How about suspended play tonight.   What do you do tonight?  
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Eating, rest, and play tomorrow morning 7:00 a.m. on the 15 tee.  
   
 Q.   What is your approach for tomorrow?   Let it fly?  
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Just try to be my best and we'll see after 18.
