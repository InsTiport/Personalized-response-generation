Q.   You will be in the final group tomorrow.   You have a one‑shot lead over everybody else.   First time in that position.   How are you going to feel when you go out there tomorrow?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   I think tomorrow I will be nervous because that's the first time in the lead.   So I'm going to be nervous, but I'll try to do my best, and we'll see after 18 holes.

Q.   You've had some experience.   You won the British Open Amateur.   Is there anything you can take from that experience?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Just try to be my best and enjoy and be in the present.   We got 18 holes, so just try to do the best.

Q.   This year has been a rough start for you.   Only made one cut.   Where has this week really come from?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Like I got more confidence on the ‑‑ the last few events I got a bad chipping, so I work a lot last week on my chipping and I got more confidence. 
So like if I miss the green I got more confidence and I know I can make an up and down easier than last week. 

Q.   15 minutes ago did you think you were going to be standing here as the leader?   I think you were four shots back. 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   No, 15 minutes ago I would say like ‑‑ even like after 18 I say, Oh, no, I'm not in the lead because, Alison Lee was 11‑under or...

Q.   For a while she was 13‑under. 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   13‑under before 16, and I was just 10‑under.   I make a perfect birdie and so it was good.

Q.   This is the only time on the LPGA that you've had three rounds in a row in the 60s.   Where is the momentum coming from? 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Just try to be patient and just my best.   I know like if I try to be my best I'm going to make some birdies.   So I'm just patient and make some putt and everything.

Q.   I noticed you an injury last year; is that correct? 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yeah, I had a shoulder injury.

Q.   What did you do to pre‑hab and rehab your shoulder?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Like try to reinforce my shoulder.   I got a special fitness program with my coach about my shoulder and my back, and now it's better.

Q.   Feeling a little bit more fit this year?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yeah. 

Q.   I noticed you also did a few events on the Symetra as well. 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yeah, I play in Sarasota this year, and I don't think I'm going to play more events.
Like why I play in Sarasota is because I didn't get in San Francisco.   I don't have a lot of confidence, so I said better to play Sarasota and make the cut and get more confidence. 
So I think it's a good idea.

Q.   Do you think that helped your game a little bit this week?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yeah.

Q.   You mentioned earlier you think you'll be nervous tomorrow.   What do you usually do to calm your nerves?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Just breathe and not thinking about lead and everything.   Just try to do my best and be in the present.

Q.   Like they British Amateur, do you feel like you performed well when you were in such a situation?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   When I won the British Amateur, I don't have the game to won, so I just play every match and win every match, and at the end I win the tournament. 
So I try to do the same tomorrow.

Q.   Were you looking at the leaderboard at all today? 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yes, sometimes.   Especially on 18, because I said, Oh, I need to make a putt to make like‑‑ when I was close to the hole I need to make the putt like one shot behind the leader.
It was good and everything.   I didn't hear ‑‑ I mean later. 

Q.   Talk about 18.   The whole hole and then the putt, the birdie, and the excitement that you felt about it. 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   I got like 77‑yard shot.   I know it's downwind and everything, so I tried too hit like 70‑yard shot.   I hit perfectly what I wanted to do and stop on the hole. 
The putt was easier, so I make it.

Q.   How does it course play to your game?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   It's good.   Pretty similar o European golf courses.   I'm from France, so pretty similar to French.   It's good for my game.

Q.   You mentioned you were a little nervous but excited last night when you left the course on contention.   What do you do last night? 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Just rest and, you know, watch myself on the TV.   Was so funny.   All the night it was funny.   Nervous, but funny.

Q.   What are you going to do tonight then?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Probably the same, and enjoy with some friends.   That's it.

Q.   Where you living in the States now?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Orlando with you my coach.

Q.   Who is your coach?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   He's from France.   He moved here with the wide and kids, so I live with them in Orlando.

Q.   He moved here when you moved here as well?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   No, no, before me.

Q.   So you know him before or just got connected. 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   No, just connected. 

Q.   Great.   What would it mean to you to get this victory tomorrow?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Happy and that my hard work pays.   Tomorrow is another day.   We'll see tomorrow. 

Q.   When is the last time you played in the final group on Sunday? 
PERRINE DELACOUR:   On LPGA event? 

Q.   Or just in general.
PERRINE DELACOUR:   In general, I think never.   Or like I remember, but I don't remember all time.   But was as   a pro first time.

Q.   Are you excited?
PERRINE DELACOUR:   Yeah.   Nervous, too.   I'm going to try to do my best.
