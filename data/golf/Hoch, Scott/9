 Q. How were the conditions today?
 SCOTT HOCH: What a great course. It's tough. It's tough. This morning might have been a little tougher, but this afternoon I think they have a little more wind. 
 Geez, it's, there are just no let up holes. And even the holes that you think would be good birdies, you still have to be careful on them. 
 You got to get the ball in the fairway. I missed the fairway on 10 thinking that's normally a birdie hole, and I missed the fairway, I was just chipping it down in the fairway and I hit it too far in the rough and made double. But even if you play it the right way, sometimes it's tough.

 Q. 1-over is a good score so far today, how do you feel about your round?
 SCOTT HOCH: I wasn't that pleased. Driving was a little erratic. I did much better on the back side. But there was a point there for about three or four holes in the front and the back where I missed some fairways and it cost me some bogeys and doubles. 
 So other than that, I played a little safer than I would like to. I didn't, wasn't even as aggressive with my driver as I would like to be. I need to get in better position where I have a better chance at birdie. 
 So I was mostly really trying to hit the fairways and going for 2-putt pars. And that's just, when you're not aggressive and get the ball down the fairway it's kind of tough to get the ball close. And it's not that easy to make many putts here.

 Q. What will you work on this afternoon in preparation for tomorrow and hopefully tomorrow it's going to be a little warmer?
 SCOTT HOCH: After I'm finished with my round I just want to go have lunch.
