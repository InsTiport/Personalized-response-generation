Q.
20 years after you won it, a lot has changed, the tournament, the course, everything.  Has it become a -- obviously a bigger event, but a better event?
SCOTT HOCH:  Yeah, it's a very good event.  I'm pleased to see how the people respond to it, come out.

The weather could be a little different.  It's a lot of people out here and it's nice to see.

This is a great place to have a tournament.  I'm not sure you have too many other big events out here, so people come out and support it, and I'm glad to be back.

I was here last year but I didn't play because my hand was bothering me.  This is the first time I've played 72 holes and I enjoyed it.
Q.  We jumped in here mid-stream, two-time winner here.  This has got to be a nice area for you to be back at.
SCOTT HOCH:  This is one, I just miss the pork chops.  Pork Chop Hill at the other place, they just don't have that here.  The pork chops they have here aren't any good compared to what they have at the other course up on the hill, Pork Chop Hill.
Q.  Got to feel good going into today.  One wouldn't have bet against you after your success in this area.
SCOTT HOCH:  I would have because plenty of people are ahead of me.  I tried to make a good run early, but I had a couple errant shots and a couple putts that should have given a little better effort.  Seemed to be a little tentative today, especially after I got it going, made some early, and you can't do that.  That's why I'm down with the also-rans.
