   DAVE SENKO: Questions for Scott.   
  
  Q. What happened on the last?  
 SCOTT HOCH: Just hit a terrible putt. Just right hand took over on it. Had not been putting all that good, but I haven't missed anything like that. Just pitiful putt. That's all it was.   
 I'm thinking I'm going to make birdie on the last hole, that's always been good to me. I got a little sidehill lie on my second shot so the ball started out right of where I wanted to and I knew the wind was going to take it. I guess I just thought it was a foregone conclusion on the putt. There's nothing to it.   
 And I thought I made the chip shot -- I think I was still thinking about that I had already made the chip shot or I made the chip shot and it just kind of hung in there and didn't break like I thought it would.   
  
  Q. Turned out to be the demolition derby the last couple hours.   
 SCOTT HOCH: I lost it on 7. It could have been a walk away. I had a 4-wood to the green, and I thinned it in the trees. I'm thinking of definitely making birdie there and I'm making double, and then I bogey the next hole. So I lost four shots right there on those two holes. I didn't even have a chance to win, crazy, without having to shoot nothing. Demolition derby is about right; who can step on themselves more.
