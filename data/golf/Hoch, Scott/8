  Q. Nine over par, but still right there in the mix toward the very end.   
 SCOTT HOCH: I couldn't wait to get that last putt in the hole. It was draining. Because I played poorly. And it was a struggle all week.   
 And actually came out today feeling pretty good. I hit some good shots. And I thought I got my game back. And then I had about a four or five hole stretch where it reappeared what I had been doing most of the week. So it was just a struggle and luckily like the last five or six holes I parred. And some of them were -- they were tough. 17 and 18 are very tough right now.
