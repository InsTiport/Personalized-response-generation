  LUKE GUTHRIE:   Learned a lot, played a lot of good golf.   Just I don't know if it was nerves or what.   Just didn't putt very well today.   Missed a lot of makeable putts, but it's another building block for me.   Hopefully I get in this situation more and more, and a lot of great players, took them a little bit, so I'm just going to be patient for my time. 
Basically all the way up until he chipped in on 17‑‑ that was kind of the nail in the coffin there, because 18 is a dangerous hole and you don't know what's going to happen and with where the pin was, if you hit a good shot, it might go in because there's some bowls towards it.   That's about when I thought it's over.   It was a good week.

Q.   You said at the start that you wanted the world travel, so now you've seen a little bit of China.   Have you enjoyed the whole experience of playing golf in a different part of the world? 
LUKE GUTHRIE:   Yes, very much so.   I mean, it's been great.   I've never been on that long of a flight.   Just landing here, getting to meet a lot of people here and trying to communicate a little bit.   It's all been a little bit of a challenge but it's been a fun challenge, and I'll definitely come back to China at some point.   At certain points for sure I'll come back.   I'll play majority of the PGA TOUR but when the opportunity presents themselves, The European Tour is great.   There are a lot of great players over here and events are awesome, so why not. 
Tonight I'm going to get to go to Shanghai and see where I've been this whole time, because we've been kind of staying right here on property.   It gets late kind of quick, and to me, I should be sleeping right now compared to where I'm from, so it's been a little different.   Looking forward to getting to see the city tonight.
