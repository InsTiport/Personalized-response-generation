Q. Bruce, 4 under, a couple thoughts about the round.
BRUCE FLEISHER:  You know, I could have been better, could have been better.  I let some get away, but I played pretty solid.  I think I missed one fairway, and that's really the key here.  You've just got to keep the ball in play and hopefully hit some good iron shots.

I birdied three of the par 3s, and that helped obviously, and then I birdied three par 5s. So a couple bogeys, four birdies, pretty good.
Q.  All the guys in the morning were saying there are going to be low scores out there later, and sure enough, the afternoon guys took advantage of it.
BRUCE FLEISHER:  Oh, boy, who was it?
Q.  They all said it, every one of them.
BRUCE FLEISHER:  Well, I'm glad it's over, buddy.
