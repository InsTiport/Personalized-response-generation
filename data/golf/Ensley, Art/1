 Q. Just talk about winning with Jay Don Blake. 
 ART ENSLEY: Jay Don was a great partner. He was really steady all the way. Unfortunately he came up a little bit shy. John Cook is a great champion. 
 Jay Don is just a great partner. We teamed up real well. Really ham and egged it and did the best of it.
 But a great guy. Great player. I'm sure you're going to see more of him.

 Q. Have you played this event before? 
 ART ENSLEY: This is my fourth year. Made the cut my first year, so this is my fourth year to play. It's always just a pleasure to play on Sunday and get that extra round in. But winning is such a bonus.

 Q. What was it like for you being right near the end when both the tournament and the amateur competition are coming down the stretch?
 ART ENSLEY: Well, you're dreaming a little bit. You feel like you're a part of it. Even from the amateur side you get a little glimpse of what it must be like to play on tour. 
 It gives you are a lot more appreciation for what these guys can do on a day-in, day-out basis. I hit a few good shots, but they hit an awful lot of good shots. 

 Q. Can you quickly give me your mini bio. You're from Houston, 5 handicap. 
 ART ENSLEY: Houston, Texas, I'm 5 handicap. I play out of BraeBurn Country Club. You might have heard Fred say that our good friend Johnny Carrabba got me involved in the tournament a few years ago. I'm good friends with Johnny and his family, and so we play quite a bit. 
 5 handicap. I've got a little company called Ensley Properties, an oil and gas consulting company I have with my wife. She's an integral part of the company as well.
