Q. Emily, currently in second place.  You must be very happy with your first two days here?
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Yeah, I'm very happy.  I didn't get to play a practice round, so I'm really happy that I get some good shots and kept it going today, even though I had a little bit off-start, very happy.
Q. What's working well for you here?
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Putting and my ball-striking is pretty solid, and today I only hit 13 greens but my chipping was very good, so that kept me in the game today.
Q. Happy memories of this course, because it was here you won Rookie of the Year.
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Yeah, it's happy and I like this tournament.  I love the place here.  Then I had a really great flight, so it's just so many positive things the last couple of days.  I think that's kept me very calm and happy.
Q. It could be an extra good round, because this afternoon, the wind is supposed to strengthen, so the draw could be kind.
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Yeah, I'm happy with the draw.  The last three holes, the wind picked up quite a bit and played quite tough.  I'm glad we're in the clubhouse now and can have some lunch and practice.
