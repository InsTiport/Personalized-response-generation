Q. Did you have a good day today?
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Yeah, I had a really good group, so it was very nice to like feel a bit of relaxed, really calm all week, and I was quite tired coming in on Tuesday and waking up with all the jetlag, so that was very nice.  I think it just helped me that I was so calm on the course and really enjoyed it out there and hit a lot of good shots, holed a lot of good putts.
Q. Did you play in the pro-am or did you have a practice round?
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: No.
Q. You were just remembering it from last year?
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Yeah.
Q. So feeling good like you can do a bit better now here this year than last year?
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Yeah, hopefully if I keep staying calm -- I struggled a bit with my long game and ball-striking last week, but that seemed to be better today, so if I keep that going and keep making some putts --
Q. So you're still going to play a few events next year?
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: For sure I will.
