 Q.  Happy with your day?  
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Yeah, quite happy.  Minus three is a good start.  The first nine holes, I played some of the best golf I've ever played.  Really had a good flow and made a lot of birdies.  I don't think I had a chance outside of five meters, so that was really good.   
A bit annoyed, disappointed that I couldn't keep it going on the back nine and I had to shoot 2 over.  That's a bit disappointing, but overall, really satisfied with my start.   
 Q.  It was almost perfect conditions today.  Wasn't too hot, hardly any wind and a day you had to go out and made a score, wasn't it?  
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: True.  I won't say it's easy out there but it's much easier than Monday, Tuesday, and a lot of good pins, opportunities, especially the back nine, which was my front nine.  The pins are good and you have a lot of wedges and a lot of good birdie chances.  So it's really about making the best out of these holes.   
 Q.  How did you feel you were playing coming into this week?  
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: Pretty good actually.  I've had a lot of changes in my swing.  I've been struggling a bit with injuries.  My hand was not very good in Japan.  But I'm starting to hit the ball better and I'm starting to be better at my putting, which is something I've struggled a bit on this year, so good.   
 Q.  The contrast couldn't be more different from last week to this week, course wise, temperature wise; how do you adjust?  
EMILY KRISTINE PEDERSEN: This course suits me well.  I get to hit my driver and I get to target the pins a bit more, which I like.  But it's really good.  You know, that's what golf is all about, adjusting every week.  I like it here.  Hopefully I'll do good.
