Q. Well you must be excited.  You are ended up in the Top 5 on the board.
AARON HICKS:   Oh, I did?  Oh, nice.
Q. Wasn't sure if you heard about the passing of Hank Aaron.
AARON HICKS:   Yeah.
Q. Just your thoughts on what he meant to the game and you personally.
AARON HICKS:   I mean, yeah, I heard during my round that he just passed away.
I mean, he's an icon in baseball.  He's a guy as a black athlete, to be able to see somebody do that, you know, that looks just like me, is incredible.
And he means a lot to our game.  We've truly lost somebody that means a lot to our sport.
Q. Did you ever have a chance to meet him?
AARON HICKS:   No, I never had the opportunity.  But that's one that's going to suck.
