MAUDE AIMEE-LEBLANC: The wind was very tricky today.  It was the complete opposite of what I played during the practice round.  So I had to pretty much change every club on every tee shot.  So it was tricky, but it was the same for everybody.   
 Q.  As it stands right now, you're the low Canadian so far today.  How does that feel?  
MAUDE AIMEE-LEBLANC: It feels good.  I mean yeah, I've been playing well lately.  My putting was good today.  So I just need to keep that up the next couple days.   
 Q.  How does the support of the pro Canadian crowds feel?  
MAUDE AIMEE-LEBLANC: It feels amazing to play in front of Canadians.  I mean last week and this week.  You can tell they're excited when we play well.  So that's nice.   
 Q.  So your game seems to be rounding into form over the last several tournaments.  What's different?  
MAUDE AIMEE-LEBLANC: Just mentally.  Just feel more confident.  Just trying to keep things more simple and just stay in the present, stay patient.   
 Q.  Knowing that there's going to be back-to-back tournaments in Canada, were you looking forward to these two weeks?  
MAUDE AIMEE-LEBLANC: Absolutely, yeah.  Playing in Canada is always my favorite thing.  So these are by far my two favorite tournaments.  So yeah, I was definitely looking forward to it.  And it's towards the end of the season, so gotta make every shot count.   
 Q.  You've quietly had a really good season here.  We think of Brooke Henderson and Alena Sharp.  But you've had not quite as good but very good season.  Was that your goal?  Did you expect to have kind of this break-through season?  
MAUDE AIMEE-LEBLANC: I wouldn't call it a break-through season.  But definitely keeping my card for next year, that was a big thing.  Yeah, coming back after a terrible first half of the year feels really good mentally.
