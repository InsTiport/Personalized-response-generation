Q.   I'm sure you're disappointed.   Tell me how you're feeling now.
KOUMEI ODA:   Yeah, disappointed, almost. 

Q.   What were you trying to do on the last putt?
KOUMEI ODA:   Of course, to get in‑‑ I was going to make it but they had a par putt, also, so that's why I couldn't hit well. 

Q.   You were down, but you fought back.   Watching the leaderboard, did so many of Asia winning help you? 
KOUMEI ODA:   Of course.

Q.   If you could play this round again, how would you play this round differently if you could play it again? 
KOUMEI ODA:   Luiten played very good so what I regret is 3‑putt he made on number second, that I regret so much.

Q.   What do you think about this week, first time, EurAsia Cup, have you enjoyed yourself here? 
KOUMEI ODA:   Of course, I enjoy, but of course he lost.   That's why I cannot enjoy very well.
