Q.   Europe won the first four matches.  Any thoughts?
 
ROSIE JONES:  The first thing I did was see a lot of blue on the score  board.  Two years ago we were the ones who came back on Sunday. 
 

Q.   How have the fans been?  It seems they want the Americans to win.  How are you feeling?
 
ROSIE JONES:  The fans are great.  It added to the intensity to play for these fans and people. Your country is great.
