   ROSIE JONES: It's so emotional to watch these girls. They fought so hard and really came together in the last couple of days to do so well, and it's just really hard.  
  
  Q. Ryann O'Toole was visibly shaken there at the end. She came over to you. What did you say to her to try to help ease the pain?   
 ROSIE JONES: You know what, she played awesome. She's undefeated in her first Solheim Cup. That is just unbelievable. She feels, you know, she feels bad because she was 2 up coming in.   
 But I tell you what, she got three points this week, and I don't know if anybody else did that. So that's pretty awesome.  
  
  Q. What would you like to say to Alison Nicholas and her team who so fervently wanted to win to avoid losing four of these in a row?   
 ROSIE JONES: Well, congratulations. They were really hungry for this, and you could see it on those last five holes. It was really amazing.  
  
  Q. Is there anything that you could have or would have done differently that might have brought you a different outcome?   
 ROSIE JONES: Well, I think I might have made some changes yesterday and given Cristie Kerr a break. Maybe changed a couple of pairings in my yesterday morning matches. But for the most part, it's like I said, in golf you can't really go backwards, and you've got to commit to your decisions and adjust later.   
 Unfortunately, Cristie couldn't play today, and she felt really bad about that. But we had 12 really strong girls, and they all played their heart out for each other. We just didn't have enough.
