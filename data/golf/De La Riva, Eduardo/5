Q.   67 around here is a good score.   You must be happy with it?
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yeah, very good. I played really good golf, and with the wind, it's very difficult, and the greens are a little bit difficult, also.   So I am very happy. 

Q.   Do you like this style of golf, links golf? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yes, I like very much the links courses.   I played last year the British Open at Muirfield and I finished 15.   So I like very much these courses, tricky courses.

Q.   Do you like it when the wind blows more or less? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yes, I like very much the wind, not too much the rain.   But with the wind I am happy. 

Q.   Why is that?   What about the wind do you like? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Because I always play in‑‑ my course is near the beach, and I am‑‑ I play all my life with wind.   So I am happy with the wind. 

Q.   Does it feel stronger this afternoon? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yes, very strong.   The nine back holes are very strong, the wind.   And I think tomorrow it's going to be a lot of hard winds.   We need to play good golf with this wind. 

Q.   What about this tournament, how much do you like this tournament and the Pro‑Am format? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yeah, I like it.   I am with a very good guy, so I am happy with this tournament.   All is good. 

Q.   You played last year, didn't you? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yes.   I played last year. 

Q.   You did reasonably well, didn't you? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yes, I finished 30 or 40 or something like that, and with my amateur, we finished fourth.   So very good.   It's different, different tournament. 

Q.   Does that make it sort of a bit more enjoyable, you can relax a bit? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yeah, it's very slow.   You need to be concentrated, but it's good.   It's good.   It's different. 

Q.   And what about your season as a whole? 
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   My season, I play good from January to June, but from June to September these last three months, I played very bad.   So I need good tournaments to finish the year. 

Q.   Maybe this week?
    EDUARDO DE LA RIVA:   Yeah, this week.
