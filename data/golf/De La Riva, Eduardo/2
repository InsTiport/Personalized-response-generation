EDUARDO DE LA RIVA: Very, very nice second round with 4-under, and the day was tough with the wind, and yesterday I played very nice.  And 3-under today, still be very happy.   
 Q.  How tough was it, because you still have come out with a very nice score.  
EDUARDO DE LA RIVA: Yes, it was very tough, because with so high winds, are very difficult to do good shots.  And the putting in the first nine holes was very, very difficult to putt.  So I am happy with the round.   
 Q.  What are you thinking when you see Andy Sullivan, you might not be aware, but he moved eight strokes clear at one stage but now you've narrowed that gap to five.  
EDUARDO DE LA RIVA: Yes, five shots is a lot, no, and he's playing very, very well.  And I try tomorrow; if the day is like this, can be possible with a very low round.
