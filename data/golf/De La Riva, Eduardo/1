 Q.  Please give us your thoughts on how well you played across the course of this week?  
EDUARDO DE LA RIVA: I played really, really bad the first nine holes, but I made three birdies to finish and then I bogeyed the 18th.  But my game was today very poor.   
 Q.  When you started, were you still thinking you could chase down the man who has won?  
EDUARDO DE LA RIVA: Yeah, but when you see how he played -- it's very difficult, and with my game of today, I don't have any chance.   
 Q.  When you do get a chance to sit back and reflect, though, it has been a good week, hasn't it, an awful lot of positives?  
EDUARDO DE LA RIVA: Yes, third place in a European Tour event is also a good tournament.   
 Q.  Still a lot to play for this season?  
EDUARDO DE LA RIVA: Yes, I hope I can arrive to Dubai and then to finish there my year.
