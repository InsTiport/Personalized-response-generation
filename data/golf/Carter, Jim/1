 Q.  Initial thoughts on the round, final round?  JIMMY CARTER: Well, I shot a couple over.  I had my chances, and I didn't quite get the momentum going.  Then I made a couple of mistakes and just kind of deflated me a little bit.   Q.  Seemed like the front nine, you maybe had some momentum going?  JIMMY CARTER: Yeah, I was close.  I had chances to get some good birdie runs going, but it didn't happen.   Q.  What did it feel like, taking the wind out of your sails?  JIMMY CARTER: I just think I was a little too tight.  It was exciting.  It was -- I wanted to really play well today, and sometimes you just try too hard.  I've been guilty of that before.   Q.  Were you taking more risks?  JIMMY CARTER: No, I just -- I don't know.  I just don't think I was quite as loose as you need to be.
