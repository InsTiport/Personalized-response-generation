 Q.   Compare and contrast your first three holes compared to how you finished off with three birdies, is that right?  
JIM CARTER:   Yeah.   Well, it's not a big difference, just the scores changed.   The course is tough and there's a lot of tricky pins out there.   So if you stray very far some bad things can happen.   You can get in some tall grass and it can all happen in one hole.   
   
 Q.   Did the wind direction affect anything at all today?  
JIM CARTER:   Yeah, we're not, none of us have played here very often, so it's, every time the wind changes it's a little bit of a practice round.   Because we're a little bit unsure of the distances and what's going to happen.   But it's a nice place.   It's a good challenge.
