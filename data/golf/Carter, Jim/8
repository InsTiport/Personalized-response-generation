Q.  Couple thoughts from you about the golf course, how it played and about setting the course record? 
 
JIM CARTER:   I always like to set course records.  No doubt about that.  This was a good day to do it.   It was a little softer so you could hold your longer shots.  But to do it in the afternoon round is  -- that's a little bit more of a feather in your cap because it had been walked on and stuff. 
 

Q.  Having played the course now twice, what are your thoughts about it? 
 
JIM CARTER:   I like it.  I mean, I think there is a lot of great courses in Pennsylvania, in this area, to be sure, and this is a real good one.  I've heard nothing but good from all the players.
