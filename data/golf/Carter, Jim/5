 Q.   Solid round today, a few birdies, one bogey, only a few shots off the lead, what are your overall thoughts on how things went?  
JIM CARTER:   I was really pleased.   It was good ball striking and I made a couple more putts today, weather was nice, felt good temperatureâ€‘wise, which is nice, I guess, when we get older.   
It's a tough course and it's a little bit stressful, but it was fun.   
   
 Q.   Take us through number 7 today.   
JIM CARTER:   That hole, I think it was just good fortune, that hole is just tough.   You got to hit a great drive, the cold wind is coming off the lake there and I think I had a maybe a 185 yard shot that I was lucky enough to get on the green and just make the putt.   
So you're happy if you get out of there with a four.   You're happy to hit the fairway and then to hit the green.   It's just great hole.   It's tough, challenging from the second you walk up there.  
   
 Q.   What are your overall thoughts on the course condition so far this weekend?  
JIM CARTER:   It's perfect.   I was really surprised that it would be this good with the winter that they had up here, but it's awesome.   There's not really a dead spot in sight.   It's amazing.   The grounds crew must be magicians.  
   
 Q.   What's your mentality heading into tomorrow only a few shots off the lead?  
JIM CARTER:   I'm sure those guys will probably stretch it out a little bit, but I'm just going to stay patient and play as hard as I can and get as low as I can and hopefully it will be good enough.
