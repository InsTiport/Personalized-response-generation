  YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Three birdies and an eagle, and then I made four bogeys.   I made three straight putts.   That's good in a way.   That's good for the day.  
   
 Q.   Being a Tour player, how good is it to have made the cut?   
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   I've made the cut in every tournament in MENA Tour I've played this year.   I make every cut.   I play, I think, seven in Dubai and two in Morocco, I make nine cuts.  
   
 Q.   And here you made‑‑  
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   And here I make cut, too.  
   
 Q.   And that's good because this is Asia Tour, too.   
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Perfect.   I like Asia Tour.   
   
 Q.   It's much more difficult to make the cut, more of an achievement?  
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Yeah, exactly, more difficult to make the cut here.   But I like this course, too.   Very nice.   Very nice.  
   
 Q.   And your back was hurting?   
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Yeah, yesterday and this morning.   Very, very bad here.   But I try tomorrow to keep going.  
   
 Q.   Play through the pain?  
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Exactly.  
   
 Q.   You wanted to quit, give up after nine holes?  
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Yeah, after nine holes I hit all the bad shots, and then I talked to the medical person, he doesn't go.   I talked to the players, maybe I stop, hold up at 9, and then they said, keep going, Younes, keep going, you need to play, you need to play, nice course.   And then I finished.   
   
 Q.   What's it like; you're the only Arab who's made the cut?  
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Yeah, I think maybe Saissi made the cut, too, no?   I don't know, but‑‑  
   
 Q.   But is that good for MENA Tour?  
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   That's good for MENA Tour, yeah, because they all want Arabs to play this tournament and he make the cut, because we play 10 tournaments in MENA Tour and we give the place to play here, and you make a cut.   This is very good.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised that MENA Tour players have made the cut here?   Are you surprised?   
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Yeah, in MENA Tour they have some good players like Zane Scotland and (indiscernible).   There are some good players.   I think very good players.   I think he made the cut here.   It's too easy for him to make the cut here.   
   
 Q.   What is it about this course that you like?   Why do you like this course?   
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   I like this course because I like the course when you need to hit good second shots.   Here when you hit good second shots, you play very good.   When you lose the second shot, it's very difficult because the greens are slopey.  
   
 Q.   And the conditions compared to yesterday?   Were they very different?  
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Yeah, exactly.   Yesterday was in the afternoon I think it was windy and in the morning it was perfect, and today it was not windy.   It's a very good day.  
   
 Q.   So tomorrow you're hoping for no more wind?   
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   No, not a problem with the wind.   I need only this one‑‑  
   
 Q.   Get a massage tonight?  
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Yeah, exactly, and we'll play.   We'll play with good players, too.  
   
 Q.   Do you expect the MENA Tour players to finish quite highly?   Can they keep going higher?   
    YOUNES EL HASSANI:   Yeah, yeah, we can do good because when you make the players MENA Tour, the first time I think he need to make the cut first, and then when he make the cut, then he stay two days, and two days he play for top 20 or top 10, you know, because the first time he said, I need to make only the cut.   When you play good, you are seven shots to eight shots behind the leader.   In a way we've got to play now because I made the cut, and maybe he play good, maybe he make 6‑under, 6‑under.   No pressure.   No pressure.
