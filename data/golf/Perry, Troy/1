  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 TROY PERRY: Sure, it would have been great for me to be playing tomorrow. It was good to see all the players that you see on TV and see  
 most of them in the dining area and all that.  
  
  Q. Talk about your round today. What happened?  
 TROY PERRY: I got off to a good start this morning. I birdied 16. I made a good par on 17 and then I finished with a double on 18.  
 Got off to a bad start on the second round on number 10. I had 60 yards and hit it over the green and made bogey.  
 I bogeyed 12. I kind of hung in there throughout the round. I was like plus three making the turn. And then I 3-putted 2 and just from the front of the green and then I 4-putted number 3. And then that put me plus 6. So I thought I had to do something to give myself a chance. I made three birdies coming in. I was pretty proud of that.  
  
  Q. With the weather delay and all that today, how did that affect your play? Did it?  
 TROY PERRY: I don't think. So as a club pro, we're used to seeing some of that sort of stuff. It's just part of the game. Everybody is doing the same out there.  
  
  Q. Talk about your experience or talk about the experience coming from your section in the PGA?  
 TROY PERRY: It's been great. I was probably the only one that made it from the section. So it was fantastic. I hopefully I -- I had a couple hiccups out there but I made a couple birdies out there and I felt I represented my section well.
