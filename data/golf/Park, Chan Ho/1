Q. What was it like to play with Lydia?
CHAN HO PARK: Well, I've been watching her playing on the TV a lot, but I never think about to play with her, you know.  But this is great for me to learn from, and how amazing her personality I realized today.  I can see she's feel like she has many experience and she gets along with us very well.  It makes us very comfortable.  I'm hoping we gave her good luck.
Q. Thinking about a second career as a caddie after baseball?
CHAN HO PARK: Maybe, maybe.  It's fun.
