 Q.   Talk about No.2?  
JOSEPH BRAMLETT:   Yeah, I blocked my tee shot down the right side.   I had about 187 flag, about 174 front, and actually kind of awkward lie in the rough, ball was sitting in some dirt just up against some grass.   Came up perfect, 6‑iron, came off like a laser and hit a really good shot and just right on line the whole time and went in.  
   
 Q.   You had never had a double‑eagle before?  
JOSEPH BRAMLETT:   My first double‑eagle.   I've had three hole‑in‑ones.   I came close yesterday, and now I got a double‑eagle.   
   
 Q.   You guys have hit every shot, what's it like when you get a double‑eagle?   
JOSEPH BRAMLETT:   Oh, it was unbelievable.   It was unbelievable.   It's awesome.   
   
 Q.   What was your reaction?   
JOSEPH BRAMLETT:   It was cool.   I don't know what my reaction was.   I was just, you know, enjoying the golf and it was a lot of fun.   
   
 Q.   Three‑shot swing there‑‑ I know you've been playing good all weekend.   
JOSEPH BRAMLETT:   Just got me off to a good start.   Spyglass is a tough golf course.   So starting off like that was really good, we are right in the tournament and in really good shape.   
   
 Q.   Did it change your way of attacking the course at all?   
JOSEPH BRAMLETT:   No, I mean, I was trying to do the same thing all day.   I was just fortunate enough to get off to a great start.   
   
 Q.   Talk about making the weekend in general, or Sunday?  
JOSEPH BRAMLETT:   It feels good.   Today was very up‑and‑down.   Pretty draining day.   So I'm going to try and rest up and go attack Pebble tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Just throw caution to the wind and go for it?   
JOSEPH BRAMLETT:   Well, things don't change.   Still going to play the golf course the same way I always do.   Just going to try to get the ball in the hole as fast as I can.
