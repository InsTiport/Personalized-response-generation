Q.   That must have felt pretty good. 
    LAM CHIH BING:   Yeah, it's nice to be making putts.   It's been a while. 

Q.   It was putting today then?
    LAM CHIH BING:   Yeah, I hit the ball reasonably well, not great, but yeah, I made a lot of good putts today. 

Q.   The winds were swirling all day, I think?
    LAM CHIH BING:   Yeah, it was pretty windy when we teed off in the afternoon.

Q.   Ball‑striking must have been fairly decent, as well?
    LAM CHIH BING:   Yeah, fairly decent, yeah, but main thing was putting today.   I actually made some putts today, which it's been a while, I think, since Q‑school this year.

Q.   You put yourself in a good position for the first round.   How do you feel going ahead for the next three rounds? 
    LAM CHIH BING:   Well, obviously after a round like today you've got to feel pretty good about your game.   But it's three more days.   Hopefully there will be a few more rounds, same kind of scores. 

Q.   Looking at the Order of Merit at all?
    LAM CHIH BING:   No, I'm not.   Frankly I'm on holiday.   I've not even bothered.

Q.   Maybe that was the best approach to take away all the pressure?
    LAM CHIH BING:   Yeah, I've actually been playing so bad I haven't been looking at the Order of Merit for the past couple of months.

Q.   What will be the thoughts for the next few days then?
    LAM CHIH BING:   Again, I think it's the first time in Dubai, seems like I really like this place.   My family is coming on Saturday, so I'm pretty much on holiday mode, no matter how it goes.   If I play good this week, it'll be a bonus.
