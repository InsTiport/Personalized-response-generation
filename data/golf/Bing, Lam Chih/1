Q.   Did you miss an opportunity this morning? 
    LAM CHIH BING:   Yeah, I did.   The thing is I hit the ball exactly the same as I did yesterday.   I was hitting it pretty solid, just the putts didn't drop today.   Simple as that.

Q.   It was down to the greens then?
    LAM CHIH BING:   Yeah, it was just around the greens.   I missed six greens today and I shot 7â€‘over on those six holes.   I made my share of birdies, but yeah, I just need to stop making soft bogeys.

Q.   I suppose the only consolation is that you're only three behind the current leader, which is not many on this course, right? 
    LAM CHIH BING:   I mean, I don't know where it's going, but I guess.   Obviously I'm still in with a chance, yeah.   Again, I just need the putts to drop like they did yesterday.

Q.   Will you go back to the putting green later on?
    LAM CHIH BING:   Yeah.
