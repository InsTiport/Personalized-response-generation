 Q.  Jeong Eun Lee, 9-under round, a career best round for you, what was working so well for you out there?  
JEONG EUN LEE: Overall, my ball striking was really today and my short game was too, so I was able to score a 9-under. After there were many birdie opportunities but I left a couple of them out there so that was a little disappointing.   
 Q.  The back nine in particular, you played very well, 7-under on the back including four birdies in a row to finish it, what worked so well for you on the back nine?  
JEONG EUN LEE: I think that my short game on the greens came together really well and I was able to make long birdie putts that went in and I want to say that those really came into play today.   
 Q.  You had the best finish of the year last week at the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship, tied for 18th- what did you take away from there coming here to Thornberry Creek?  
JEONG EUN LEE: I didn't play at this event last year because I was injured, so now that Iâm here this week, I really wanted to shoot a low score. I shot my best score last week at the Walmart Championship but one month ago, I switched to a new coach and heâs given me a lot of great advice on several things in my game and weâve changed a couple of things. Thatâs the reason why I had luck today.
