Q. How do you feel starting the tournament as a such a great round?
JEONG EUN LEE: Overall, everything went well today. Iâve got my condition back from the last day of the Buick LPGA Shanghai. I am trying to keep this going.
Q. What do you like about this golf course?
JEONG EUN LEE: I really like this golf course. The course has very similar condition as Korea. I felt very comfortable playing here, just like how I have been doing in Korea.
Q. What do you feel like coming back here to play?
JEONG EUN LEE: Although I have been in Taiwan several times, it felt different as the golf course has been changed. Personally, I feel more comfortable to play at this course. I will do my best to make some great result.
Q. Youâve got some good results recently. Have you been working on something that is paying off?
JEONG EUN LEE: I focused on taking some rest as it was so hot at the practice round and the course has lots of uphill. The hotel is really great to take some rest and provide great food and fruits for vitamin!
Q. Towards the end of the season, are you hoping to have a strong finish?
JEONG EUN LEE: Although it has been only 2 years, I wish to make good results. Things went well at the beginning of the season, but I was not always feeling satisfied with my performances. I want to win an LPGA tournament as soon as possible. As I feel very comfortable playing at the Asian Swing, I will try to put my best effort on winning.
