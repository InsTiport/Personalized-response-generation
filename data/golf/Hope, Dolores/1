Q.  We wanted to know, you know, neither you nor Bob were at Bermuda Dunes today, are we going to see Mr.  Hope this week or you at the tournament? 

DOLORES HOPE:   I don't think, so.  The doctors say no and the family says no. 

Q.  Is it just that he's tired right now or something specifically that's going to keep him away at this point? 

DOLORES HOPE:   Thank God, he's doing very, very well.  They are all very apprehensive about picking up germs and being around people and all of that.  There's so much stuff going around that I think it is unwise to subject him to any of that. 

Q.  I know he had some problems last year where he was hospitalized.  We understand he's recovered from that?

DOLORES HOPE:   Oh, yes.  Thank God, yes.  He's in very good physical health.

Q.  Will we see you out at the tournament this year at all? 

DOLORES HOPE:   Pardon? 

Q.  Will we see you out at the tournament at all this year? 

DOLORES HOPE:   I'll be there.  Absolutely.  I would have been out there today, you know, but I was told not to come out because Parnevik could not be there, and they thought the weather was not as good, I don't know.  So I would have been there.  I'll be there. 

Q.  Will Mr.  Hope be watching the tournament over the weekend on television? 

DOLORES HOPE:   No, he's not going to be out at all.  He's retired. 

Q.  Will he watch his own golf tournament over the weekend on TV? 

DOLORES HOPE:   Yes.  Yes, he will.  So if you have anything nice to say about him, he'll hear you.
