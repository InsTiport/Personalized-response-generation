 Q.   (Inaudible)?
GIBBY GILBERT:  (Inaudible.)  I ended up playing professional golf.  If it hadn't worked, I don't know what I would have done.  Every day I thank my lucky stars that I did this.  I wouldn't advise my son or anybody else to do that.  It's not real smart.

Q.   You were 20 when you were in Florida.  How quickly were you on the tour and all that?
GIBBY GILBERT:  In '61 I played amateur golf and turned pro in '65.

Q.   That's a lot of years.  How were you supporting yourself through that?
GIBBY GILBERT:  I put my wife to work.  I hustled the golf down there and she worked.

Q.   What was she doing?
GIBBY GILBERT:  Working in a bank.  It was my first wife, and then, you know, in 1967 I went to qualifying school and took second to Bobby Cole in qualifying school.  I have been on the tour ever since.  The first two years I did not make the top 60, and I didn't qualify, and in May of the third year I won Houston.  That was in 1970.  I stayed with them for the next 14, 15 years. 

Q.   (Inaudible)?
GIBBY GILBERT:  Of course, Arnold Palmer was the king back in our days.  Now Tiger is the king.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
GIBBY GILBERT:  If you go back years ago, early '60s, all you heard of was Arnold Palmer.  I think those two actually put golf in the eyes of the world, and we owe a lot to them.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
GIBBY GILBERT:  Absolutely, and he's a 73-year-old, and I know he's going to quit playing out here one of these days.  We hate to see it.  He could play out here at 90 years old and we would love it.

Q.   Anything else you would like to add?
GIBBY GILBERT:  No, that's about it.  You covered all the questions I would ask. 

Q.   Okay.  Thank you.
GIBBY GILBERT:  All right.  Thank you.
