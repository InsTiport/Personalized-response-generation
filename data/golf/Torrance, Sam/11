Q.   What did you think of today's play? 
SAM TORRANCE:   They played well, our boys played well today, but they had a few more birdies than us, three 3 1/2, 1 1/2.   Return tomorrow. 

Q.   What are the main positives you take out of it?   I'm sure you guys are always looking for the good things?
SAM TORRANCE:   Well, the opening match, you put your best match out first, and they stood upto be counted, great win, 3 & 2. 
Second match, Tommy Fleetwood, Chris Wood had a great come back.   They had a good chance on 17, about ten feet, and about 8‑footer on the last.   Unfortunately didn't make any of them, but lost 1‑down, but that could have turned either way.   Four or five holes to go, we were well down and it almost turned where we could have got 3‑2 ahead, but that's golf. 

Q.   What are you doing out there to try and help the guys along?   What are you saying to them as the matches are progressing? 
SAM TORRANCE:   Just cheer them on.   They don't really need much.   They are all great young players and it's great to watch.

Q.   What about the pairings for tomorrow?   Have you already decided those? 
SAM TORRANCE:   No, I'm not going to change much.   It's difficult to change a winning partnership‑‑ haven't really had one of them, but Simon Khan and Paul Casey had a fantastic match, as well, good birdie on the last from Molinari‑‑ lucky with his tee shot, but Manassero was in close, too.   So I don't think I'll split them up. 
Scott and Mark just came up against a red‑hot team with Colsaerts and Gonzo.   We are going to talk about it and see.
