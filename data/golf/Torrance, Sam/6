Q.   Pretty delighted with that? 
SAM TORRANCE:   Great day's golf.   Great fighting from both teams.   JimÃ©nez's put on the last was fantastic, 49 years of age.   He hit that like a 29‑year‑old but David Lynn knocked it straight in, and David didn't play this morning.   Just a fantastic result for us.

Q.   The comeback from your lead team, as well; you wanted that revenge with Paul Lawrie and Stephen Gallacher?
SAM TORRANCE:   It's ideal, when there's only four playing the session, you put out your best teams.   All four were great teams but you want the teams to lead and for there to go four‑up early on against their absolute best team was fantastic for us.   Lifted the whole team. 

Q.   I'm sure you wanted a lead into the singles but 9‑all isn't bad. 
SAM TORRANCE:   Of course I wanted a lead but we were two points going into the last session of four.   Fantastic day for us.

Q.   What's your thinking in the singles with Jamie Donaldson out first, Paul Casey second? 
SAM TORRANCE:   Well, they have played the best golf this week.   Donaldson has been fantastic, 10‑under, 9‑under, 10‑under the other day.   He plays quickly and I just wanted him out there first, and Casey is just playing fantastic.   I couldn't have picked a better man to play against Colsaerts.   I think he's their best player.   And the rest just fell in beautifully. 

Q.   Your thinking, since your Ryder Cup victory has been the template for European teams‑‑
SAM TORRANCE:   I didn't do anything like that.   It was totally different than The Ryder Cup.   I went best first, worst last, which it's not a good way to describe it because there's no player in The Ryder Cup is your worst player; they are all great players.   But I felt who was playing best out first and just filtered down the whole way. 
Here it was different and they are all playing great and it was actually quite easy to put them in.   As it turned out, amazingly enough, off the sheet, when you get the alphabetical sheet, I went down, went straight to Donaldson first, he was always going to be first out in my mind, and Casey was always going to be second.   I thought Fleetwood is just ready for a cracker, so I put him in three and then I put‑‑ because it's in alphabetical, he's four, he's five, he's six, he's seven, he's eight, he's nine and he's ten, and the four Scotts are right together and it was not planned whatsoever.   So that's great for them, too. 

Q.   They are the backbone, are they? 
SAM TORRANCE:   They are all the backbone.
