   SAM TORRANCE:  It's a good score. I played really solid and had a chance to shoot 67-68 quite easily, but it's the Open and it's tough. This is a great test of golf. Everyone likes testing conditons and these are testing. You have got to play really well, hit a lot of different shots, high and low. It's fun. 

 Q. Your only frustrations today were on the greens? 
 SAM TORRANCE: I missed so many putts it was scary. I three-putted 12 and missed from four feet on 13, just missed on 15 and how my putt on 16 didn't go in I don't know. But these are the things you have contend with. 

 Q. You suffered again with some mixed weather? 
 SAM TORRANCE:  It started off just as bad as it was yesterday. It abated for two holes, that was it, and then it pissed down and the wind got up. 

 Q. I guess you would have taken this position at the start of the week? 
 SAM TORRANCE: Absolutely. I just want to go out there and play well tomorrow. I was up there going into the final round of the US Senior Open so I know what it feels like and it will be great. I am looking forward to it. The fans are great, I have great support, so I will go out tomorrow and see what I can do.
