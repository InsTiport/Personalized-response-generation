Q.   Talk about the afternoon of foursomes. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Pretty simple, we lost the session and we played three days of golf, and looks like we start from scratch tomorrow.

Q.   What will you be saying to your team this meaning? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, what I kept on saying all week long, that we have to play the best we can.   We have a very strong team facing us, and that we have to play good tomorrow. 

Q.   Six consecutive losses, how much do you want to win this?   Can you put it into words? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Obviously I want to win it badly, as simple as that.   I don't like that record at all and hopefully this group of ten people will be able to achieve that tomorrow. 

Q.   How impressed are you with what these guys are coming up with under this sort of pressure?
SAM TORRANCE:   Fantastic, first two boys out winning both their matches, Chris Wood's bunker shot to 17 which is magnificent.   JimÃ©nez knocking that in there to put the pressure back on, it's just been a fantastic event.

Q.   What pleased you most about your play this afternoon? 
SAM TORRANCE:   Just they kept going.   Paul Casey, they were 2‑down most of the way around and they just kept fighting and went 1‑up and lost 16 and one on 18, fantastic. 

Q.   What will you be saying to your team this evening? 
SAM TORRANCE:   Same again, please. 

Q.   How formulated is your singles order?   You top‑ordered when you were captain at The Belfry.   What's the plan today? 
SAM TORRANCE:   I don't know yet.   I have a glimmer of what I'm doing the top 5 matches, I'm not certain.   I'll go chat with the boys.   Everyone doesn't mind where they play so it's really down to me.
