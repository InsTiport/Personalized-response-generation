 Q. Thoughts on the day?
 SAM TORRANCE. Played pretty well tee to green to be honest, I was pleased with that aspect, but I just never holed anything out there which was a pity. I had a lot of chances out there and perhaps I should have shot around 70 if I had taken some of them but not to be, that is the way it is. I pitched in at the 16th for my eagle three which was a real bonus. The course is in magnificent condition even though it is strange with the wind the way it is being 100 per cent the other way round from how it usually is. But I know it this way as well, it doesn't bother me. I think to be honest, it is an easier wind for the course because the back nine is the harder nine. The back nine is easier while the front nine was harder but not impossible. Looking forward to tomorrow there, I'm still in there fighting.
