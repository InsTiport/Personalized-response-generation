Q. How was it today?
SAM TORRANCE: Fine. Tough day but I played well and just putted terribly.
Q. Do you know how many putts?
SAM TORRANCE: 36.
Q. Not good enough?
SAM TORRANCE: Useless, but 74 total was all right.
Q. Still striking it well though which must be encouraging?
SAM TORRANCE: Yes, I'm playing very well.
Q. Carnoustie tomorrow -- the toughest of the three courses this week?
SAM TORRANCE: It seems to be. Well it always has been, but the scoring seems to be better there for some reason. I don't know why that is, maybe they have set it up easier but I am sure I'll find out tomorrow.
