  Q. You've had a great couple days here. What can you say about the field and the course?  
 SAM TORRANCE: The course is beautiful. Got to put it on the fairway, put it on the right side of the green, and don't be aggressive. But it's a pleasure to play and I'm enjoying it.   
  
  Q. Looking forward to the next couple days?  
 SAM TORRANCE: Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.  
  
  Q. Did you do any change to your game plan for today?  
 SAM TORRANCE: No, not at all. Just go out and shoot as low as I can.   
  
  Q. Is this one of the more difficult courses for the Senior PGA events?  
 SAM TORRANCE: No, no, it's not. No. No. We played that one down in Kiawah there, we played where Vijay won. I can't remember the name of the course.   
  
  Q. Did the course play different this morning?  
 SAM TORRANCE: Yeah, the wind was a hundred percent opposite direction. So it was totally different, yeah.
