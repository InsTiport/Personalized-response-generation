SAM TORRANCE:  Got three or four treatments from the physio van has been great.  Done a good job. 
 
Q.  Is it the intercostal?
 
SAM TORRANCE:   No, that's gone.  The one I actually had a couple of years ago that kept me out for six months, it isn't anything like it was you about, but it's the same place.  Two years ago  -- maybe not that long ago, a year and a half ago.  
 
Q.  Any idea why? 
 
SAM TORRANCE:   Just woke up and it was there. 
 
Q.  Do you think it was the same thing again? 
 
SAM TORRANCE:   No, it was never serious.  I played yesterday.  There was no way I could have played if it was serious.  
 
Q.  So all in all, you've you're fairly satisfied?
 
SAM TORRANCE:   I played well.  I didn't hole much. 
 
Q.  How frustrating was it at the Belfry when you were not playing so well and then taking a week off and coming back again  --
 
SAM TORRANCE:   Ten days without striking a ball when I was playing great, but my dad is here and he sorts me out. 
 
Q.  Are you still swinging as well as you were then? 
 
SAM TORRANCE:   Yeah.
