  Q. Tell us about your round - a very tough day out there.   
 SAM TORRANCE: I ripped a drive up the first and a three wood and nailed both of them and was 50 yards short of the green. The wind was that strong. Got a nice birdie on 5 and played to the turn in level par. Missed a five foot putt for par on 10, 14 I drove in the bunker and didn't get it back on the fairway, doubled after lipping out for my bogey putt. Bogeyed the next, made a nice birdie on 17, but drove in the bunker on 18. I was pleased to get up and down for my 5 out of the sand again. It's been tough, very testing. I said yesterday it was the toughest I've seen Muirfield, and I'm not going to change my mind after today, that's for sure.   
  
  Q. Do you think you've had the worst of the draw and conditions?   
 SAM TORRANCE: Definitely. We definitely had the worst yesterday, out in the mini-tornado. It's testing, but I said to Daniel today, it's a great day to play golf.  Daniel's doing great on my bag, I haven't sacked him yet! I was never under par today, but over the two days, my two scores are getting better, as players go the other way. Hopefully, that'll continue today. I'm in with a fighting chance.
