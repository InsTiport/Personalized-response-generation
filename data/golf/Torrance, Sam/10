Q.   How do you reflect on a first day here? 
SAM TORRANCE:   Obviously disappointed.   I thought the team played very well.   They had some fantastic scoring, the Europeans.   A couple of matches towards the end.   Could have swung either way.   Didn't go our way, went their way, so we are two points behind.

Q.   So you've turned things around a little before day two, tell me the reasoning behind that?
SAM TORRANCE:   Well, we sat in there for an hour, all of us, and I couldn't see any reason to change anyone, but then I thought maybe just change‑‑ well, ends up being two pairings changed, Marc Warren and Scott Jamieson.   They are very friendly, and sometimes playing with your best friend isn't the best thing.   So I've split them up, we'll see. 
I see JosÃ© has not changed any of his pairings, so obviously if it's not broken, don't change it.   Obviously ours isn't broke, that's not why we changed it.   We'll see.

Q.   Satisfied everybody is pulling their weight?
SAM TORRANCE:   Absolutely, they just played their heart out.
