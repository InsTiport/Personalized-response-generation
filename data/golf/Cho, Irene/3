 Q.   So, second place finish today.   Your career best.   Just talk about how good that feels versus having to sit there and wait to see if maybe you had a playoff?   
IRENE CHO:   You know, it feels exactly the same, and I'm very proud of Ilhee.   She played hard.   I'm just thankful we got in all 36 holes, and here's to next week.  
   
 Q.   Just talk about this week.   When you showed up here, did you feel like there was something you wanted to work on in your game?   
IRENE CHO:   Honestly, I was always working on something with my game.   I was working really hard on my putting this week, and that helped a lot because I (Indiscernible) the first day, just FYI.   So after that day I was going to work on my stroke and make sure I got my stroke back.   
It is what it is, and I'm happy for everybody.   Yeah, here's to next week.
