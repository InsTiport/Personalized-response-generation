Q.   So only eight players are under par right now, I don't know if you all know that, you both are two of them.   What were conditions like out there today? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Rainy. 
IRENE CHO:   Rainy. 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah.
IRENE CHO:   It was like we didn't even get a chance to talk to each other.   We were like so busy doing stuff.   We just chatted, like, all right, one hole down. 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   That's basically what we did.   And now the wind picked up a little.   I think it was an advantage to start early today.   It feels nice to be done now. 
IRENE CHO:   Yeah, I don't know ‑‑ it feels nice to be done.   I think it slowed down a lot on the back nine.   At least on the front, we were like ‑‑ had to set the pace.   So it was a lot quicker and we could just do our thing.
But on the back it slowed down a lot.   So more stay in your routine I guess atmosphere.

Q.   So what was working well for both of you out there under the tough conditions? 
IRENE CHO:   Judging, just your yardages I guess and your iron shots and just hitting drivers, like in the center and being in the fairway and then just judging the rain and the non‑rolling. 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I think we hit it close a couple of times. 
IRENE CHO:   Yeah, we did.
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   And made a good amount of birdies for being in these conditions.
IRENE CHO:   It was nice to have like fresh greens I think on the front. 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Yeah, yeah.
IRENE CHO:   I think the greens definitely slowed down on the back just because of all the traffic they were getting.

Q.   So you all didn't talk at all today? 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   A little bit but not much.   Everyone was just focused. 
IRENE CHO:   Good shot, good shot.   Like that was pretty much most of our day.   I think I asked her like one question when we were on the back nine, but just kind of staying in like your little0.
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Just with the umbrella ‑‑
IRENE CHO:   Under the umbrella ‑‑ it's like hard.   You can't like walk next to each other.   This is a good week to test if you really like your caddie because you're spending a lot of time with him. 

Q.   Does it make it even more difficult the fact that you've been out in Asia now for four, possibly three weeks in a row? 
IRENE CHO:   You're just used to it now.   You know, you hit and go, hit and go. 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Basically. 

Q.   Caroline, for you, International Crown coming up next year, your leading the standings I think in your country. 
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Oh, we are?   Yeah, yeah. 

Q.   How excited are you?
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Well, I just love playing team events.   I'm very excited about it, so it would be fun. 

Q.   You have a good record at Solheim Cup.   Is that just kind of your‑‑
CAROLINE HEDWALL:   Anna and I, we played really well at the Solheim, too.   So it would be a lot of fun playing with her.   Because it's foursomes and stuff, too, right?   Yeah, I think I'm just looking forward to it.   I think it's fun to have another team event on the schedule.
