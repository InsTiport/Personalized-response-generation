 Q.   So I just saw a few of the highlights of your round?  
IRENE CHO:   You did?   
   
 Q.   You holed out‑‑  
IRENE CHO:   Par‑5.  
   
 Q.   For eagle?   
IRENE CHO:   I didn't even see it, but apparently it was just in.  
   
 Q.   What club did you hit?   
IRENE CHO:   I hit a 9‑iron from, gosh, I want to say it was like 118 into the wind, so it was just a punch.  
   
 Q.   Then a par save from the beach?   
IRENE CHO:   Oh, yeah, that was awesome.  
   
 Q.   That was hole 13?   
IRENE CHO:   Yeah, 13, that hole is playing super hard, especially because the wind's blowing everything right, and you're like, man, how far left do I have to hit this thing.  
   
 Q.   Is it in that little cove?   
IRENE CHO:   Yeah, uh‑huh, and it was in the beach, and I was like there is some water around it.   And I was like, shoot, I'm going to pull out a little Bill Haas and just try to get this up and over.   My caddie's like do it, and I was like, okay.   
So, yeah, I got it out perfect, and I was like, okay, let's make this fly.   And he was like yep, you got it, pro.   And it was a nice little solid putt.   My putting was so good today, and I'm very happy with that.  
   
 Q.   Just talk about obviously a strange week?  
IRENE CHO:   A little bit.  
   
 Q.   12 hole rounds, but regardless, how nice is it to finish up?   
IRENE CHO:   Oh, my gosh.   I wish we got to see the rest of the golf course because it's really, really pretty, and it's a great look out on the ocean.   But kudos to the maintenance crew for having us finish on hole 18, which is only the second time I've played it.  
   
 Q.   What did you end up shooting today?   
IRENE CHO:   7‑under.  
   
 Q.   Great round.   
IRENE CHO:   Thank you.
