  KARIN SJODIN:   It went in.  
   
 Q.   Did you celebrate?  
KARIN SJODIN:   Of course.  
   
 Q.   What did you do?   Did you jump?  
KARIN SJODIN:   No.   I had my mom.   She's here.   She came last night late, so it was good to have her here.   And Tom, of course.   It was one of the few solid shots today.   
   
 Q.   What club was it and how far?  
KARIN SJODIN:   Was it 133?   And it was like a tiny 9‑iron.   
   
 Q.   How many is that for you?  
KARIN SJODIN:   Seven.   
   
 Q.   Is that for sure?  
KARIN SJODIN:   Yes.   My mom thought it was four, but‑‑  
   
 Q.   Did it fly in or kind of trickle‑‑  
KARIN SJODIN:   It landed about three feet short to the right and then kind of trickled in.   It looks good in the air, too, though.   It's kind of one of those where you enjoy it the whole way.   
   
 Q.   How many on Tour?  
KARIN SJODIN:   I had one in a European Tour event last year before I got injured and then two in the Swedish Championship, but this was the first, I guess, real LPGA one.   Awesome.
