 Q. Tell us a little about your round today. 
 BERNHARD LANGER: Struggled today a little bit with the long game, the swing, the rhythm wasn't there, I was swinging too fast, I think, and just blocking a couple. And didn't hit as many fairways and greens as I wanted to and then struggled all day somewhat with my long game.

 Q. So that was the big difference, it wasn't putting or?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Well, I didn't putt great, but I didn't putt any worse than the other two days and just didn't hit the ball as good. 

 Q. What's your mindset now going into tomorrow? Do you feel like you've got to put up a pretty low number now?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah I got to be aggressive tomorrow, I think, and actually as you say, put up a low number and hopefully put some pressure on these guys by creeping up the leaderboard and posting a good score. 

 Q. Do you feel like with the earlier tee times and the way this course is playing that you might have a slight advantage going off a little earlier?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Well, no, a half hour an hour is not going to make much of a difference. It would be a difference if you, you know, it was two or three hours earlier the course might be a little bit different, but I don't think it's going to be a huge difference.

 Q. So do you go to bed tonight with a number in mind?
 BERNHARD LANGER: No, not really. Just going to play every shot as good as I can and hopefully go into the 60s and as I said, post a good score.
