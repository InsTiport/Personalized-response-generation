 Q. A few general thoughts, you moved into contention there, nine holes to play, and had a shot at the end but the bogey at 17 probably just bitter pill right now, right? 
 BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, I looked at the leaderboard as I got on 16 and saw I was one behind McNulty and behind Funk and he still had the par 5 to play, so I figured he might birdie that. 
 So I changed my game plan. I used to hit hybrid there all week and I felt all along it's a driver down there hopefully on the fairway and hopefully make birdie. Made a bad swing, pulled it to the left. Actually hit a lady on the chest. Shook her up, shook me up, and ended up making bogey and had a nice birdie on the last. 

 Q. Is she all right?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, I've heard she was okay. A little in shock early on when I saw her. 

 Q. Still in a good stretch, looking forward to next week's Senior Open?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, still playing well. I just had one bad day, that was Thursday, that really put me in the hole and I had to dig myself out of there. I'm pretty pleased with the way I played the last three days. 

 Q. Are you going next week?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Another big one. It never ends. Another big one after this.
