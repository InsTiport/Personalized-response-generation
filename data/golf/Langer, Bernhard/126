Q.   Beautiful round today. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   Yeah, it was. 

Q.   Striking the ball better or conditions or both?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Well, conditions were good, but especially the last five holes I was 5‑under, hitting the ball well and finally making a few, 10, 15 footers.

Q.   You eagled 15?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Yes. 

Q.   What did you hit there?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Driver, 5‑iron.   To about 10 feet. 

Q.   18?   Birdie?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Yeah.   I hit 3‑wood, 6‑iron another about 12‑footer, 15‑footer. 

Q.   Well, what's your feelings about Harbor Shores?   You've seen it both ways with the weather bad and good. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   Well, they set it up very fairly.   It's, the greens were soft, which helped. 
The greens, if the greens had been firm it would have been a very, very tough test.

Q.   What do you think they were running at?
BERNHARD LANGER:   I don't know, probably about 10, 11, I would think.   Not a lot more, not a lot faster than that.   And the greens are pretty severe, so they kind of had to do it that way, I think. 
If they would get really fast and firm, it could be really, really tricky.   So I think the setup was good and that's what they did.   There's a lot of good players out here, scoring is good too.
