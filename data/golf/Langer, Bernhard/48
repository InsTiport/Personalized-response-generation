Q. Change of wind conditions today.  How did that affect the course?
BERNHARD LANGER: Just a little bit.  It wasn't that much different.  It was south, southwest going out and then changing to south.  Just slightly different but not majorly, and the wind was only about ten miles an hour, so it wasn't ridiculous.
Q. How did you play today?
BERNHARD LANGER: Played all right actually.  Got it to 3-under and then just had a tough finish.  Actually hit not too bad shots actually.  4-iron on 16, just pushed it a yard or two, and same on 18.  Just went in the bunker both times.  Didn't get up-and-down.
Same story.  Just haven't made a lot of putts.  Made a couple today from 15 feet or, so but you have to make more to be up there.
Q. Are you going to change any tactics for tomorrow's final round?
BERNHARD LANGER: There's no other tactics you can go.  You can only play so aggressive on this golf course; if you go crazy, you're going to get punished real bad.  I think my tactics have been good.  Just not making too many putts and a tough break at the end there.
Q. Because the course is so tough, would you say it's a benefit for the chaser rather than the leader around here?
BERNHARD LANGER: Not really.  I think I'd rather be two or three in the lead than two or three behind, just because it's not that easy to make a lot of birdies.  It's the kind of course where you just grind to make pars and hopefully make a few birdies here and there.  But it's not one where you are probably going to make eight or nine birdies.
