 Q.  73, two back, are you satisfied with that round?  BERNHARD LANGER: Not totally.  I didn't play very good the first, whatever, nine holes anyway. I had a really good first hole, missed a birdie putt, and then struggled a bit from that point on.  But I was pleased with the way I played the last sort of six or seven holes.  That was pretty solid.   Q.  Very tough golf course, only one player under par, but obviously you're in the mix.  How do you feel going into the last three days?  BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, I'm happy that I'm only two behind.  So there's still a lot of golf left.  It's going to be hard tomorrow morning, with the temperatures and the weather, the wind, the course is going to play even longer at 8 in the morning.  But we'll try and hang in there and try to avoid the big mistakes.
