 doing pretty well.   Can you talk about your round today?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Really don't want to talk about it ‑‑ just kidding. 
It was a rough start.   I just couldn't get much going early on.   It was very tough with the wind and I didn't make a lot of putts.   So I was 3‑over after nine and just tried to hang in there and finally played very steady on the front side and shot 1‑under.

Q.   You came in 1‑under par for the front?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Right. 

Q.   Looking forward to tomorrow?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Yeah.   It's a long week.   A lot of stuff can happen on a golf course like this.   So at least I didn't shoot myself out of the tournament, I'm still in there and I'm five back at the moment, but five shots can be easily made up in a whatever, 54 holes.
