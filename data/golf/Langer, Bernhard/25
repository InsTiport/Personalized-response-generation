 Q. Obviously the bogey there at the end made a little bit of a down note. But overall pretty good first day for you?  
BERNHARD LANGER: I played well. I really hit the ball very well. I hit a lot of shots the way I wanted to hit them. It's difficult when you come in with long irons to stop the ball to get it near the hole. So I didn't have a lot of birdie chances. I made one mistake on 8 when I attacked the green in two, and shouldn't have. Ended up making a six, when I should have made four or five. That was really the only mistake, the bogey on 8 and two threeâ€‘putts.   
But there was a lot of good, and much more good than bad. I just didn't make a putt. I was playing with Finau, Tony Finau, he made one putt after another, and that's what you need to do. The greens are great. You've just got to make them.   
   
 Q. Some sort of carry over when you're playing with somebody that hot, sometimes it can give you a little push there?  
BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, it usually gives you a push, but it didn't happen today. He made them all.
