VIJAY SINGH:  It was really wet out there, which made playing conditions difficult, but I am playing well enough I just need some putts to go in. I knew it would be tough against Bernhard, he is a great competitor and I am sure it will continue to be a good match this afternoon.

BERNHARD LANGER:  I played quite well but missed too many short putts. That was the biggest problem today and the three footer I missed on the last summed up the first 18 holes.
