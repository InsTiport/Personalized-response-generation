Q. Now that round three is complete, how would you assess your play?BERNHARD LANGER: It was a quick turnaround, but what else can we do.  The weather was so bad the day before.  The greens were so wet you couldn't even putt the next morning I don't think.  But we don't control the weather. It's been a very tiring week, especially the way I was playing last week, as well, at The Open Championship going into Monday.  So I never had a day to rest really.  It's taxing but my play is not too bad.Q. You'll play 54 holes on the weekend here.  What is the key to maintaining performance over that period of time?BERNHARD LANGER: Just keep your patience I think and try to keep everything dry, especially the way the forecast is supposed to be for the fourth round.  I don't think we are going to have any breaks with the weather.  So just maintain your energy and your focus and keep plugging along.
