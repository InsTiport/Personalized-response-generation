  BERNHARD LANGER:   I gave it away.   I could bogey the last hole and win the championship, and probably chose the wrong club for my second shot.   I should have maybe played it short to take the bunkers out of play. 
A little unlucky that the ball got in a bunker where it was pretty deep, and thought I hit a decent shot but it came out too low.   The sand is firm with the rain that we had.   Had a chance to make the putt.   Didn't make the putt. 
But I made two good pars on the playoff in the dark, so what can you is say.

Q.   Did your thoughts go back to Valderrama and sharing for a tie with Colin Montgomerie? 
BERNHARD LANGER:   Yeah, I actually did.   I shared one with Seve, TrophÃ©e LancÃ´me one year and one with Monty, but this is a major and we are not going to share majors.

Q.   Have you ever known anything quite like headlightson the buggy, going back down the 18th and trying to beat the dark?
BERNHARD LANGER:   I used to play when I was young, 15, 16, 17 at my home club in Munich, we used to play in the dark, but never in competitive golf.   This is the darkest it's ever been.
