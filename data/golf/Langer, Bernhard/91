Q.   You had a good run on the back nine.   Talk to me about that and how you did today overall.
BERNHARD LANGER:   Yeah.   Well, it was a really good run.   I played the front nine pretty good at 3‑under, and then made a really good shot on 14 and came up about three feet short, plucked in the bank and made bogey.   That slowed me down with my momentum, but then had a fairly decent finish.

Q.   How much was the wind a factor?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Oh, wind is always a factor, especially around here when you have tall trees and it was swirling around and it was pretty strong.   It was anywhere from 10 to 20 at times.   So makes it tricky.

Q.   Anything about‑‑ you got within two.   Were you watching the leaderboard?
BERNHARD LANGER:   I was watching at the end.

Q.   I mean if it wouldn't have been for the big winds, I mean you may have had a chance?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Well, never got closer than two, I guess.   They still have a play a good of good holes, I suppose.   And 15 is not easy, and 16 is pretty tricky.   I don't know where they're at.   But I needed to birdie the par‑‑ I hit some really good putts.   Just was unlucky.
I had four lip outs, four putts that went over the lips on the last eight holes, and that was the difference.

Q.   Bernhard, 15 straight Top 10s now dating back to last year.   Your plans between here and Augusta?
BERNHARD LANGER:   No plans.   I'm going to have a colonoscopy, so that's a lot of fun.   Just spend time with my family at home, relax a little bit, work out, practice a little bit.   Have some friends from Germany coming in, and just a normal thing at home.

Q.   Okay.   We'll see you in Atlanta.
BERNHARD LANGER:   Sounds good.
