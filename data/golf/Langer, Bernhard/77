When you have to try to finish it, everything seems to be...BERNHARD LANGER: Well, the two days, nothing you can do.  You have days like that and there will be days when everything goes for me, so I'm just going to continue what I'm doing.  Swinging the club pretty good.  Been putting good all year.  Last two days were not good.Q. Setup of the golf course for the week, what was your opinion of it?BERNHARD LANGER: It was tough.  It was good, though.  You know, if you could shoot some decent scores, you get perfect shots.  That's what U.S. Open golf is all about.Q. Germany, World Cup?BERNHARD LANGER: I heard.  The guys kept me informed.  Congrats to them.  Well done.
