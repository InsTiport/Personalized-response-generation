Q.   I know it probably isn't what you wanted.   What happened was ‑‑ you had the back to back triples, is that what happened?   Can you discuss that, what happened there?
BERNHARD LANGER:   I just played pretty poorly.   I had several double crossers.   Mostly to the right.   I think I was in the water four times today.   And I just didn't putt very well either.   Just nothing really went my way.

Q.   How did the course play today and did it change with the rain?
BERNHARD LANGER:   No, the course played quite well, actually.   Only had a couple mud balls.   But not nothing too serious.   The course was in fairly good condition.   Obviously, the rain slowed the greens down a bit, but I can't blame it on the conditions, I just wasn't swinging very good today.
