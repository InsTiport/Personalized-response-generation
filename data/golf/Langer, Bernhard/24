Q. Have you seen that?
BERNHARD LANGER: I didn't want to see it, I heard about it from my kids. I was going, there's no way he can play. How they described it to me. There's no way. I think he's had that before.

Q. He said he's never hurt that ankle before?
BERNHARD LANGER: To put it right back, it's just the thing that from the outset jumps out and then they tape it up. Anyways, it doesn't seem to bother him much. I asked him several times. He wasn't wincing or complaining. 

Q. What makes this place so special in your mind, Augusta National? 
BERNHARD LANGER: A lot of things. First of all, it's the only major that's in the same spot all the time. So people can relate to it. It has a history. There's so many great players from the past, with Bobby Jones, and just how they always run the tournament, conduct it themselves. They're very specific. No running. You know. On and on it goes. Unlimited budget. They can do with the golf course whatever they like. No tents anywhere, solid structures. It's really a very special place. And they've created a tremendous following around the world for this tournament. And now they're supporting another event and women's event. I mean it's great to see how they grow the game amongst many, many other things they do here.
