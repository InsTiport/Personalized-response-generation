 Q.  Talk about Bobby being on the bag today and the unfortunate incident with your caddie.  BERNHARD LANGER: It's wonderful that Bobby would fill in for my caddie, Terry, and I was very appreciative.  He's a great gentleman, knows the course very well, and was very professional carrying the bag.  Never did anything wrong.  We read a few putts together, and sometimes we're right, sometimes we're wrong.  That's human. He was fun to be with all day, very encouraging, and I would recommend him to anybody.   Q.  Do you think it gave you a little bit of an advantage with his course knowledge?  BERNHARD LANGER: I'm not sure.  He's in a difficult situation.  He's never caddied for me, so he can't really say too much.  I play in meters, and I think I have a fairly good grip on the course in general because I played three practice rounds and I talked a lot with my caddie who was with me, my professional caddie. But there was once or twice when he thought I should maybe keep it there or there, which I basically knew.  That's what we do.  We do that for a living.  We pay attention to detail when we play practice rounds so we're not surprised.
