 Q.   So you have to be happy with your round.   Are you?  
BERNHARD LANGER:   I was extremely, very happy with the way I played and everything.   
Number 10 and number 17 I hit two perfect shots into the green.   Neither one got on the green.   I made two bogeys after hitting two really good shots, which is disappointing, but that's Augusta.   The good and bad is like this close together.   
   
 Q.   And how is the course playing?  
BERNHARD LANGER:   Very good.   Conditions are really good.   I like the course playing firm and it makes it a little bit easier for me I don't have to hit 3‑woods and hybrids into every par‑4.   I get to hit a few mid irons in there.   Which helps.   
The greens are firmer, that's the other thing, but it played very good.   The course is in fantastic condition.   Probably the best I've seen it for many, many years.   
   
 Q.   What are your goals this week?  
BERNHARD LANGER:   My goal was to win.   I had a different mindset this year.   The last few years I was trying to make the cut and that didn't work, so my goal is to compete, contend.
