Q. Intermittent rain today.  How did it play out there?  Were the conditions tough?
BERNHARD LANGER: No, not really.  There wasn't too much wind.  The rain, nobody likes holding the umbrella and getting wet, but it wasn't terrible.  It was just for an hour or so, or hour and a half.
No, conditions were great.  Golf course is in fantastic shape.  It's there for the taking.  Just got to hit proper shots and make some putts.
Q. Did you accomplish what you were hoping to today?  You're still right in contention going into Sunday.
BERNHARD LANGER: Well, I was hoping to be in the lead but that didn't happen.  I'm still there, but within shouting distance.
Tomorrow should be an exciting day.  There are a lot of guys with this five shots.  Anything can happen.
Q. Do you see that as something you can take advantage of tomorrow, getting out a few groups ahead of the leaders and trying to put up a number that they have to think about?
BERNHARD LANGER: We'll see.  I don't know where I'm going to be grouped with and when and all that stuff.
Doesn't matter where the grouping is; it's more how many you are behind.  Yeah, a good start would help to close the gap on the leaders.
Q. On the back nine I saw in the broadcast that you had a couple putts that you gave a little fist bump to.  Did you start to feel good about the putter?
BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah.  Yeah, I did make a couple really good putts there on 15, 16 I think, a save on 16 after a poor second shot and poor chip.  Really good par save there, and then a nice birdie putt on 14, I think.
So it kept the momentum going.
