  Q. How was this round compared to the first day?  
 BERNHARD LANGER: Actually I thought I played very solid. Hit it really good off the tee. I hit a lot of great iron shots today, much better iron shots than in the last couple of days I thought. And just was a little unlucky with a couple of putts.   
 My only bogey came, when I probably hit my best drive all week, and it went so far, middle of the fairway, back behind one of these big pines in the middle of the fairway and clipped the branch and ended up making a bogey there. But otherwise it was a pretty solid round.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 BERNHARD LANGER: Oh, yeah, definitely. I love playing with Fred. He's a great champion. He's won a lot of tournaments. I'm sure he's going to have a lot of support here tomorrow. He's got the background coming from Seattle. So it's going to be a little hard for me tomorrow, but I'll stick in there and play my own game.  
  
  Q. You said play your own game. That's one thing you're legendary for, your focus, your preparation, your commitment. How are you going to do that specifically?  
 BERNHARD LANGER: Well, I'm obviously going to watch Freddie hit a few shots here and there. I don't know, looking into his bag, the irons he hits, because he's quite a bit longer than me. I didn't do that today with J.R. Roth today, so I'm just going to -- as I said, I have my own game plan. I know the people will be cheering for him, because he's a local hero, and I'm just going to have to play along like I used to when I played with Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus or many others.
