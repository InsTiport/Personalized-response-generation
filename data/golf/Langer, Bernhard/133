  Q. Can you talk about the 18th hole for me?   
 BERNHARD LANGER: Today or in general?   
  
  Q. Today.   
 BERNHARD LANGER: Just hit 5-wood and sand wedge and missed about a 12-footer for birdie, made par.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the day then?   
 BERNHARD LANGER: The day was hot and humid, like every day here, but it was beautiful, sunny. We had good course conditions, played pretty steady. Just never got really hot but played all right, and 3-under is not a bad score.  
  
  Q. Any adjustments you've made from yesterday to today?   
 BERNHARD LANGER: None whatsoever, no.  
  
  Q. And anything for tomorrow?  
 BERNHARD LANGER: No, not that I'm aware of at this point.   
  
  Q. Anything else you want to add?  
 BERNHARD LANGER: No, just enjoying the golf course. Weather should be good tomorrow, just trying to play a little better, make some putts.
