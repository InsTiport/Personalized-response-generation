Q.   Talk about rallying after the 79 yesterday for a 67 today, which is tied for the low. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   Yeah, I played a lot better.   I hit some balls last night and found something that obviously worked and hit a lot more fairway, a lot more greens today.   And yesterday I just had two triples on 5 and 6 that really hurt. 

Q.   Was there a difference in the golf course from yesterday and today?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Not a whole lot, no, not really.   Maybe the greens were slightly faster today.   But maybe a fraction less wind.   But there's still some good pins out there and it's a testing golf course. 
I just made too many mistakes yesterday.   You can't make triple bogeys, two in a row. 

Q.   How fun was it out there playing today?
BERNHARD LANGER:   It was a really nice day.   Blue skies and a lot of people out there cheering us on.   I had a good group with Sluman and Rocco, so it was a lot of fun.   I played a lot better.   All three of us did good today.
