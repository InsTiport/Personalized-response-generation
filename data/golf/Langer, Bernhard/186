   BERNHARD LANGER: I was encouraged by my play the first 70 holes, and felt like I needed a birdie on last two, not easy, two tough holes. I should have taken a different club on 17. I was in between 4- and 5-iron and tried to hit a soft 4-iron and never felt comfortable. Should have taken a five and go hard at it, so that was a mistake I shouldn't make really.   
 Then 18 was not a good swing off the tee, and caught a bad lie. From there bounced into the bunker and on and on, and it is disappointing.   
 It was fun playing with Greg. He drove the ball fantastic. I think he hit driver on almost every hole. I've never seen anyone attack the hole like that. He was fortunate on a couple of them, they were close to going in the traps but he missed him but he had a bad finish and it caught up with him.  
  
  Q. Looking forward to next week?  
 BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, little tired next week but hopefully I'll be okay in three days' time.
