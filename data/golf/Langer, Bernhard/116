Q.   Your thoughts on the final day? 
BERNHARD LANGER:   I don't know, I have to think about it first.   I just finished the round and obviously the back nine was a disaster.   Just hit a couple of loose shots.   Got some bad breaks.   Ending up in pot bunkers and all of those things.   We were on the clock, as well, which didn't help.   We had to rush a lot of the shots.   Didn't make it any easier. 

Q.   Did that particularly affect you, being on the clock and having to month of a bit faster? 
BERNHARD LANGER:   It affects you more in conditions like this when you have to figure out what the wind is:   Is it across; is it slightly helping; is it slightly hurting; where do you want to land the ball, and you're in the semi‑rough and you've got a flyer, you might not.   You've got to consider all of these things, not just, okay, I've got 150, give me an 8‑iron.   Not that simple. 
So I think it did affect both of us.   It wasn't just one hole; it was a number of holes, as we were trying to catch the guys in front of us.
Fred played very well, played a solid round of golf and I think deserves to win.   He finished in style with birdie, birdie.   That's like a great champion, well deserved.
