BERNHARD LANGER:  We showed out strength in depth out there this morning. We knew it would be tough. We knew the Americans would be lifted by the spectators and that was the case. They played great but my guys showed their skills and determination.

I've said that I think we have more depth than we have ever had and Paul Casey and David Howell worked magnificently. They came into the contest with their A-games and I'm proud of both of them. Their win was vital because we all know that momentum swings are common in this game. Paul and David just played some of the best golf you will ever see from two partners making their debuts together in The Ryder Cup.

I take my hat off to Sergio and Lee. It was vital they got something out of their match. The atmosphere was electric --vocal and fair -- and Sergio and Lee stayed focused. They are great in these situations and it was just like them to hang in there. It was great theatre too. Sergio put a smile on everyone's face and Lee came out with his first halved point in 18 matches.

This is what The Ryder Cup is all about. It's a challenge every step of the way-- and our challenge this afternoon will be to extend our lead again.
