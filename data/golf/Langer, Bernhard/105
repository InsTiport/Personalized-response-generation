Q.   Three days without a bogey on this golf course.   How good is that?
BERNHARD LANGER:   It's pretty special.   It doesn't happen very often.   Because it's a very tough golf course.   It's a great test and there's so many chances to bogey holes.   It just takes one bad tee shot in the rough or whatever, a bad iron shot in the wrong place, where you short side yourself and have a bogey.   So that's very unique.

Q.   What's the lessons for somebody looking at your three scores there, you never know what's going to happen. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   Well, there's no lesson.   I just played poorly the first day and hit some bad shots at the wrong time and got some bad breaks on top of that.   I made two triple bogeys there on 5 and 6, which pretty much cost me being in contention. 

Q.   Talk specifically on your round today. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   Similar to last few days.   I drove it fairly good, gave myself actually lots of chances.   I should have really been a couple better today.   Two or three better. 
But I 3‑putted 17 from the front edge, which was disappointing.   I missed a couple of other opportunities where I left putts short or just didn't make any putts.   Longest putt I made all week was about a 18‑footer, I think.
