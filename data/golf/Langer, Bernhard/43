 Q.  So just tell us about the golf course today, all the rain, and how it affected it any differently --  
BERNHARD LANGER: It was very wet, totally different golf course.  Had a lot of mud balls, which was disappointing.  I wish we would have played preferred lies.  The greens were slower with a lot of mud balls on the fairways.   
 Q.  Did you have a different mindset coming in today, being a past champion?  Anything change your --  
BERNHARD LANGER: No, just tried to play aggressive, hit solid shots, give myself opportunities.  And I actually played very well but I did very poorly.   
 Q.  At the beginning of the day, was there a number in your head you thought you'd need?  
BERNHARD LANGER: I just knew I had to go low and didn't get off to a good start.  As I said, the first six fairways, I had five mud balls.  The ball was just getting off line so you can't get it close.
