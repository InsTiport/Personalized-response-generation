Q. How tough was that to play in?
BERNHARD LANGER: It wasn't a lot of fun, let's put it that way, and it wasn't easy.  Just constantly holding the umbrella and doing something, keeping the clubs dry and trying to keep yourself dry.  You know, thank goodness the wind didn't pick up like the forecast was, but it wasn't easy, let's put it that way.  Played long.
Q. Were you satisfied with that round?
BERNHARD LANGER: Played pretty good, actually.  Played pretty solid.  A little ticked off I made bogey on the last.  I drove it in one of those 180 traps or whatever there is.  I was trying to avoid that, so it's not great to finish with a bogey, but overall, it was a good day.
Q. Did you need patience today?
BERNHARD LANGER: Absolutely.  This golf course, you need a lot of patience, anyway.  There's trouble everywhere you look, left or right or straight ahead.
Q. With your experience, only three shots off the lead, anything can happen tomorrow?
BERNHARD LANGER: Well, that's true.  You know, the weather is going to be maybe more miserable tomorrow, and who know what is the wind does.  But yeah, anything -- I've won tournaments from seven behind, but there's a lot of good players up on the leaderboard.  So it's going to take a special round to get on top.
