 Q.  Thank you.  With Bernhard Langer.  Even par 71, is that reflective of the way you played out there, today, Bernhard?  BERNHARD LANGER: Actually I played better today than I did yesterday.  Yesterday I made a bunch of putts.  Today I had a bunch of lip-outs.  I probably should have had 69 today.  I played well enough for that score.   Q.  You were talking about as you came off the golf course, how hot it is, how difficult it is out there.   How would you describe the way it is to concentrate when you're trying to play at such a high level for a championship like this in conditions like this?  BERNHARD LANGER: It's very difficult.  We're all old, it's a little harder for us than 20, 30 year old but I never was a friend of heat and, you know, it's 95 or whatever in the shade so we're out in the sun most of the time, it's going to be over a 100.  It's just uncomfortable.  Then you're out an hour before and four hours, five hours in a row in the heat.  It's tough.   Q.  Another thing we were talking about before we started the interview here, some of the lip-outs you had after you hit some really good approaches and some really good iron shots, how frustrating is that and how do you stay so calm on the outside when we know that you're burning inside?  BERNHARD LANGER: Well, it's golf.  You have to take the good and the bad.  Sometimes they lip in, sometimes they lip out.  It was frustrating.  I played really good golf on the back-9, the last 9 holes, had a lot of chances, lot of opportunities and I think I had four lip-outs or something and left one short on 18 and could have easily been three better but could have, should have, would have doesn't count in this game.   Q.  18 holes to go.  Thanks for the time, Bernhard.  BERNHARD LANGER: Thank you.
