Q. Do you see any change to the course today from when you started?BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, it played slightly longer I think just with the rain we had yesterday and today.  The ball wasn't running as much on the tee shots, but otherwise it was very similar.  I think the course can take rain pretty good.Q. (Indiscernible.)BERNHARD LANGER: Nothing really, to tell you the truth.  I was going to say I drove it pretty good, but I did miss three fairways, I think, and so it wasn't bad but it wasn't perfect. Probably, you know, played smart.  I didn't leave myself in horrible positions.  Never made a double bogey or something like that.  So took whatever, took the penalty when I had to and then created some chances with some decent shots. With a little bit of -- had some chances early on.  If I had made a putt or two I would be 3- or 4-under, but towards the end of I putted a little bit better.Q. You're 6-under right now.  Is that...BERNHARD LANGER: That's a great score.  I mean, 6-under is a good score anywhere, but in these conditions with the kind of wind we had, that's certainly a very well-played round of golf.Q. (Indiscernible.)BERNHARD LANGER: Well, sure it's going to play a little shorter.  Could get harder, you know.  The ball bouncing more on the fairways could run through the doglegs into the rough, that's true.  I don't know.  I don't know this place well enough to really comment too much on it at this point.Q. How do you feel?BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, I feel fine, I think.  They say you don't win a tournament on the first day.  You can certainly lose it with a bad round, so, you know, I'm somewhere in the top 10 or top 20 after today, which is a good spot to be.  Still have three rounds to go.
