 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BERNHARD LANGER: I had a full sand wedge from about 104 yards, that was for eagle there. And I birdied the next hole as well. So I was 5-under after about six holes or whatever. So it was pretty neat. 
 Then made a couple of bogeys, but still played fairly well coming in. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BERNHARD LANGER: Everybody struggled with the wind during the practice rounds and today too I think. Wind makes it very difficult. Especially when it's gusty and it's not consistent out here and we look at the forecast and it said south winds, but sometimes they were southeast and then it went to southwest. So you're standing at a few shots and just guessing and hoping you're hitting the right club. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BERNHARD LANGER: I'm surprised how good the scores were. Because the course played really tough. I played almost as good as I could play pretty much and there's and Robin Freeman is in there with 6-under and there was some fives and some fours. I played with Fred Couples. He played pretty solid after a not so good start. So I'm very happy with my 66 and I think anything under par is a great score in these conditions. 

 Q. Given the late tee time tomorrow was it important for you to pose a score today?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Every round counts, every shot counts, so I don't know what tomorrow brings, I don't know if a late tee time is better or worse. You never know. But the last few days the wind picked up in the afternoon's and so there's a good chance it might blow even more tomorrow afternoon, so it's nice to have a good start. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BERNHARD LANGER: Well, I practiced some on Monday and I tried to play, but I gave it up after about 11 holes. I sent my caddie in and said I'm just going to walk the course and look at the greens and make some notes and check out some stuff. But it was really unplayable. So I didn't learn anything playing the course with 50 mile an hour wind gusting to 60, so. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, yesterday I tried to just play the back nine. I only had a quick look at it in the practice round or in the pro-am, sorry, on Tuesday, so I really wanted to have one more practice round. So I went out there playing again at 30, 35 miles hour, sometimes gusting 40, which wasn't ideal because you can ruin your swing in strong wind too, but I needed to have another look at some of the greens and see where to hit it, where not. And I think that it proved me, it helped me today. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BERNHARD LANGER: Well, actually last two weeks I didn't play as well as I would like to, but I had a good start to the year and played pretty solid most of the year. Just the last two weeks I actually played really good last tournament I played in, I didn't putt good and finished 16th. But today it was a solid day with only three or four lose shots and a lot of good ones. And the putter was good. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BERNHARD LANGER: Like most of it. It's got a lot of interesting holes, a lot of -- every hole is different, it's not boring, only two holes look alike and that's number 3 and 4. Everything else or actually 4 and 5, everything else is very different and very unique. Some of the greens are pretty severe, especially when the wind blows. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 BERNHARD LANGER: It is drivable, but you have a lot of trouble left and right. If you push it right you're either in the bunker or in the bushes. If you hit it left you have hardly any shot there either out of the thick grass. And the green is tiny, depending where they put the pin. Today it was a pretty simple pin. But there's going to be tougher pin positions the next few days.
