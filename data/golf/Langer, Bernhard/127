Q.   Talk about how today went for you. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   It was steady.   Nothing spectacular, nothing terrible, just played some good shots, hit a couple loose ones and made a couple putts and missed a couple.   So it's just a steady, solid round of golf.   2‑under, 69.   Needed a little more to get into contention. 

Q.   I was going to say, just talk about when you're chasing a guy like Chapman, the way he's playing right now.   6‑under today.   He's on fire. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   He's 7‑under right now for today, so as we speak he's birdieing.   It's phenomenal the way he's playing.   It would be a great tournament if he wasn't in the field, because the next player is like 8‑under and then 7‑under, but now he's 14, that's fantastic scoring and my hat's off to him.

Q.   Is that something that you guys like to see every once in awhile, when a guy whose maybe not a big name gets his opportunity to kind of shine out there. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   Sure, it happens all the time.   Usually in big tournaments the so‑called star players or name players come through, but every once in a while you get somebody like John Daly when he won his Major, he was just on for the week, everything goes their way, they feel good, their swing's good, and they're making putts and it's hard to stop them.   And that's what he's doing right now. 

Q.   What are your impressions of this golf course?
BERNHARD LANGER:   We have had just about every wind you can think of.   I think the first day was out of the northwest and then it was from the south.   And then we had a bit of everything.   We had very strong winds, we had just five to 10 miles an hour, and it's been a very interesting challenging golf course.   It's a beautiful place, Nicklaus did a great job, just some of the greens are a little severe.
