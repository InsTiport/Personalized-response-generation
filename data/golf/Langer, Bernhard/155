  Q. Describe some of the two rounds so far?  
 BERNHARD LANGER: Well today I didn't make any or not many putts. Yesterday I putted very well and I had a lot of lipouts today, a lot of close calls. I really didn't play quite as well. I had a really bad finish. I went the double bogey, bogey.   
  
  Q. Do you think the morning and afternoon start times had anything to do with that?  
 BERNHARD LANGER: Well there's a lot more wind today or more wind than they had this morning, yeah. Yesterday it was kind of blowing all day, it got stronger in the afternoon, but today it's very little in the morning and more in the afternoon. But that didn't have too much to do with it. I just didn't play as good.  
  
  Q. What's your overall mindset going into the weekend?  
 BERNHARD LANGER: I got to be aggressive and -- but I'm playing well, I just didn't get anything out of the day.
