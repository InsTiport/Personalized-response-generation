BERNHARD LANGER: We have plans, we have flights.  We have -- anyway, places to go and see, and we were hoping to finish it today but not going to happen.
Q. How do you think the course is going to play differently now with all the weather?
BERNHARD LANGER: No idea.  We'll find out tomorrow, but it's got to be really wet.  It will play quite different because it was pretty firm.  So probably get plugged balls in the fairways, mud balls.  So don't know if they'll play preferred lies or not, and the greens will be softer, might spin balls back off the green instead of going over.  So things like that.  It will be different.
Q. Until tomorrow, what do you do now to kind of prepare yourself mentally, physically?
BERNHARD LANGER: Not a whole lot.  The day's almost over, you know.  It's 3:15.  Probably going to hit a few balls, but there's another rain shower coming in soon.  So trying to get out, practice a little bit, and then just go to bed early because we're going to have an early start tomorrow.
