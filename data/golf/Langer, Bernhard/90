 Q.   How did you find it out there?  
BERNHARD LANGER:   It was challenging.   With the wind as swirly as it has been, it caught me on No. 12, I made a double bogey with a pretty decent golf shot.   
A couple other times, too.   It was just constantly moving directions and it's difficult.   That's what makes Augusta so hard.   The greens firmed up a little bit, which makes it harder for me coming in with longer irons, the ball doesn't stop very quickly.   
I was glad the way I played, I played pretty good, pretty solid.   I putted okay.   After all, a 72 is not that shabby.
