Q.   After the finish, and then two pars in the dark, where is your heart and where is your head at right now?
BERNHARD LANGER:   It's everywhere.   It's been a roller coaster day obviously.   I had quite a nice lead and all I had to do was bogey the last hole, and I'm sorry I keep you all hanging around till tomorrow, because I usually play a little smarter, a little cleverer.
Pulled the wrong club for the second shot.   Ended up in a bunker close to the lip with firm sand and didn't get it out.   I should have played short of the bunkers, chipped it up and make an easy bogey. 
But, things happen in the game of golf, especially when you're tired and you've had a long day.   But I was pleased with the two pars I made in the playoff and still got a another chance tomorrow.

Q.   With your experience and the highs and lows of today, do you sleep fitfully or restfully?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Ask me tomorrow.   I think I'm so tired, I should sleep pretty good.
