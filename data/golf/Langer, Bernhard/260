BERNHARD LANGER:   I really had it going today after four birdies in a row from the eighth.  Then I cut my tee shot at the 13th and it found a horrible lie and the ball was damaged, as well.  I came up short, knocked it on in three and 3-putted from 65 feet.  It should have been a bogey, at worst.  After that I kind of lost my rhythm and hit a few wayward shots.  At the par  5, the ball jumped off the club with my third shot and was buried in rough behind the green.  At least I finished well with two birdies.  I holed from 40 feet at the 17th and from six feet at the 18th.  It's been like that all week.  Some great shots and some bad ones.  That's not like me.  I'm normally very steady and I've got to get rid of the bad shots.
