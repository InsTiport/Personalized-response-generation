 Q.  I'm standing with Bernhard Langer, who's just completed his final round at St. Andrews of 72.  Got a flight to catch because there's a big tournament coming up for you in a few days?  BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, we have the Senior Open Championship down at Sunningdale.  It's a wonderful course, and obviously with the delay here, everything is kind of messed up.  We all had to rebook, and tomorrow I've got the pro-am at 10:00.  So it's going to be a busy couple of weeks.   Q.  And as the defending champion you're much in demand.  Can you just talk about your experience here?  Is this the last time you're going to play at St. Andrews at an Open do you think?  BERNHARD LANGER: Well, I'd love to come back, but it's kind of unlikely, let's put it that way, because as I've never won The Open Championship.  I would have to win the Senior Open championship to get exempt or qualify, and The Open doesn't come back here for another six years.  I'll be 64 at that point, so it would be pretty tough to qualify or win the Senior Open at age 64.   Q.  Did that cross your mind when you were crossing the Swilcan Bridge?  BERNHARD LANGER: It certainly did, yeah, that this might be my last time playing The Open Championship here at St. Andrews at The Home of Golf.  It's a little bit emotional.  It's been a wonderful tournament over four decades really for me, and I love the Scottish crowd, I love the links golf courses and all that, so it's been a big part of my life.
