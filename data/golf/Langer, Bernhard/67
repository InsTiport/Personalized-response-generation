 Q.  What are your thoughts overall on the round today after starting plus four and turning it around?  BERNHARD LANGER: I was proud of the way I fought back.  I got off to a very rough start. I actually hit two beautiful shots on 1 and a really great drive. And actually I thought a pretty good second shot on 2, but it just caught the edge and bounced into an unplayable lie where I had to play backwards, sideways, and made double bogey. I didn't know where -- it's that kind of course though.  Just was a little bit off my rhythm.  I missed a really short putt there somewhere for birdie on 6 I think it was. Then I eventually settled down and played 2-under from that point on.  But I wasn't on my A game, let's put it that way.   Q.  What are your thoughts on the course and your performance over the collective four days?  BERNHARD LANGER: It's a one of a kind golf course.  Not my favorite.  And what was the other part of the question?   Q.  Just your performance over the four days.  BERNHARD LANGER: Well, I finished sixth, which is not bad.  Would have like to have done a little better in the position I was in after two days, but it was tough.  The wind was blowing, I was surprised how good the scores were today.
