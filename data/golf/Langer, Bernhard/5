Q. How was it today and how much are you thinking about you've got to turn on the jets and put something low up tomorrow?
BERNHARD LANGER: I wish I could.  The jets were going between hole whatever -- hole 14 or 15 and about 3 or 4 I was playing really nice and doing everything well.  But the start was a little shaky, and then the double bogey really hurt.  It wasn't that bad a shot, but anyways, no penalties, just made a mess of it.  And then played good again from that point on.
So it's just -- it can grab you out here.  One bad shot at the wrong time.  But, yeah, in general, I just got to play slightly better and make more putts.  Play like Stricker, make more putts.
Q. Is this a course where you can kind of maintain momentum once you get it, or is it too hard?
BERNHARD LANGER: I think so.  If you feel good about your game, why shouldn't you.  If you can hit it where you're looking and play decent iron shots and have a good feel for the greens, read them right and roll them on the line you want them, yeah, we've seen some very low scores.  So it's out there.  It's possible.
Q. Pre-tournament, you and a lot of other guys, Watson said they were the most challenging greens he'd ever putted on and there was this thought that there was a good defense with these greens.  Are you somewhat surprised somebody's 14-under par?
BERNHARD LANGER: Absolutely.  No, I am.  But, you know, the rain has made it a little easier, I think.  We've had soft conditions.  So you can fire it at a lot of the pins.  If the greens were hard, firm and fast, it would be a different story.  But we've had rain every night.
Q. Going to need something pretty good tomorrow to get it?
BERNHARD LANGER: Not just tomorrow, in the next two rounds.
