Q. Your thoughts on the week ahead?
BERNHARD LANGER: Match Play is always different. You are playing against an opponent - not against 150 other guys. You watch your opponent a lot. You might play aggressive when your opponent is playing well but then you may be less aggressive when your opponent is in trouble. Wentworth is one of those courses where you have to have a good all round game. You have to drive the ball well, hit some good irons and make good putts. You need the whole shebang.
Q. You have a strong opponent?
BERNHARD LANGER: Yes, Luke Donald is one of the most consistent players around. He hits it straight, doesn't have much of a weakness and putts great, which is exactly what you need at this course.
Q. That's why you picked him for your Ryder Cup team?
BERNHARD LANGER: That is exactly why I picked him. He is a very strong character as well - I definitely have my work cut out for me.
Q. You have had some great success here?
BERNHARD LANGER: Yes. Three PGA Championship's here at Wentworth and some success in the Match Play. One of my bets memories from this event would be beating Vijay Singh last year when he was world Number One and I was one of the worst ranked players to be in the tournament so it was nice to cause an upset. I had some great matches with Seve in the 1980's, so there's a lot of good and a few bad memories - as usual!
