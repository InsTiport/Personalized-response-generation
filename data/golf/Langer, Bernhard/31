 Q.  Fantastic round, you must be happy with how you played in the conditions?  
BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah, I'm pretty pleased that I'm on top of the leaderboard at the moment.  Conditions were extremely tough, and not feeling very good physically.  So just glad that I made it through the day and I'm in contention.   
 Q.  Can you tell me how tough it is physically and mentally when you're not 100 percent, and to play in these conditions?  
BERNHARD LANGER: It's hard to tell because these conditions are tough even if you feel good.  But I'm not, so I'm even more pleased that I put together a pretty good score.  And it looks like the wind is not going to let up the next three days, either, so we're going to face similar conditions for the rest of the weekend.   
 Q.  And of course this is one of the toughest golf courses in Wales and this is your fifth consecutive round; you must like the golf course?  
BERNHARD LANGER: I do like the golf course.  I think it's very challenging.  You can be aggressive at times and you've got to be cautious at other times.  There's places to hit it and there's definitely a lot of places not to hit it.  So I think my game plan is pretty good.  It's just a matter of executing the shots and the putts.   
 Q.  Five birdies today, so your all-around game is very good?  
BERNHARD LANGER: It was reasonable.  I didn't drive the ball as good as I wanted to earlier on.  Like the first shot I put in the bush and it was unplayable.  That's not how you want to start a championship.  But I bounced back very strong and recovered pretty good a couple other times.  Had one bad 3-putt that I wish I could have back.  But overall, as I said, I finished with maybe two of my best shots on 18, so that's encouraging.
