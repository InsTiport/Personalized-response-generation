BERNHARD LANGER: I got off to a little rough start, three-putted 11 or 12, one of those early ones.  Teed off on 10 and hit a couple of loose shots but then got it together, got a nice string of birdies and pars and played pretty solid from there on.   
I had another three-putt on 7, which was not from a bad place, which was no good, but it is what it is.  So 3 under is not a bad place to be in right now.  You can't win it the first round, but you can't lose it by shooting yourself out of it.   
 Q.  3 under in the first round.  Anything in particular you're looking at for tomorrow?  
BERNHARD LANGER: No, just try to hit fairways and greens, and hopefully make some putts, leave myself in the right place where I might have some good birdie looks.  So that's what this course takes.   
 Q.  Thank you very much.  
BERNHARD LANGER: You're welcome.
