BERNHARD LANGER:  It's a beautiful day out here and we got to work hard.  It's going to be close.  It will be exciting to see the next few matches come in.


Q.  Playing 10 years after the fact, playing on this golf course again, how do you feel about that?

BERNHARD LANGER:  Well, I went ahead and found some time to think about that.  And obviously 10 years ago it was a great atmosphere and the Europeans, we lost the Ryder Cup.  And I needed to make that putt to win the match and keep the Ryder Cup.  And I missed then and I halved our match then.  And we halved again this time around.  And I'm looking forward again to getting invited next year.


Q.  Have you enjoyed your experience in this first time event?

BERNHARD LANGER:  It's been wonderful.  It couldn't have been any more better.  Being with my team and getting to play with Frank Nobilo that was a great experience for me.  And just being around some of these great players is always a lot of fun.  And again, my opponents were very gracious and very gentleman-like and it's been a pleasure.


Q.  Do you think this event has a future?

BERNHARD LANGER:  I definitely think it has a future and I think if you get the best players to participate over the years, and if the matches stay close as this one is, I think we have a great opportunity here.
