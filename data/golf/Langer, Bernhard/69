Q. Talk about your round today.BERNHARD LANGER: It was pretty breezy today.  Started off real windy going out, then it let up a little bit, now it's kicking in again the last hour or so.  So it's pretty tricky.  It's just a very demanding golf course. Played okay starting out.  Hit one bad tee shot there on 6 -- 5 or 6 -- into the hay and fortunate to find it and shanked it out of there and made six, which was disappointing, out of, on a par-5 to make six, but it happens. Otherwise, just try to keep the ball in play, hit some fairways, hit some greens, which is not easy. Putting was fairly good except for a 3-putt on 17 there.  But otherwise I was pretty happy with my putting, just still need to improve my ball striking a little bit the next two days.Q. Is this still a test of patient for the weekend?BERNHARD LANGER: You got that right.
