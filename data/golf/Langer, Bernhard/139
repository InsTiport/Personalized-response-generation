 Q. Your hole-in-one there, that was No 15, was it?
 BERNHARD LANGER: It was, yeah.

 Q. How many have you had on the Champions Tour?
 BERNHARD LANGER: First one.

 Q. That was your first one?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Uh-huh.

 Q. What club did you hit?
 BERNHARD LANGER: 5-iron. Pitched to about six yards short and was right online and just rolled up there. It had perfect speed. Just rolled in. 
 I didn't see it go in because it's an elevated green.

 Q. So what do you think of the course today?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Course was really good. We have to play preferred lies because too many mud balls. But the rest of the golf course is very, very good. 
 It's a really good test. You have to drive the ball well; you got to hit really good iron shots and still make putts. 
 I'm surprised how good the scores were. Conditions are perfect.

 Q. So you feel pretty good about starting off? 
 BERNHARD LANGER: Yeah. I'm in the hunt. Three behind, so still got three rounds to go. Just got to work on my putting a little bit, and hopefully make a few more putts. That would help.

 Q. Perfect. Thanks again for Tuesday night. Appreciate it. 
 BERNHARD LANGER: Thank you.
