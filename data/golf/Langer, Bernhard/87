Q.   Tell me about how it went. 
BERNHARD LANGER:   Some good and some bad.   How did it go?   Just hit some nice shots and hit a couple of crummy ones.   I made a 3‑putt bogey there on the fourth or fifth hole we played. 
Then I had three birdies in a row, which was nice. 
It was really not too bad except for one hole of the I pull hooked my 8‑iron into the hazard on 3?   4?   4.   It was double bogey there.   It was ugly. 

Q.   Four round event though, so you have some more golf?
BERNHARD LANGER:   Yeah, whatever is leading, five, 6‑under.   I'm not too far behind, so I'm within shouting distance.
