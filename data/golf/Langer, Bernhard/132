   BERNHARD LANGER: I played a lot of good shots, just too many bad ones, and what really got me is I left a lot of putts short. I thought the greens were very slow, and I struggled to adjust all week long. They looked faster, they putted very slow. Even downhill putts were slow. It was weird.

 Q. Was it a little faster today? Corey thought maybe they got more toward the speed they --
 BERNHARD LANGER: I really struggled, even today. Today especially. I felt the putting green might have been a little faster this morning than the last few days, but out on the course it still felt -- you can't make birdies if you leave them short. They won't go in. That's a guarantee. That's as much my fault as anyone else's, I just couldn't make myself to hit it. 

 Q. Was it just a function of the moisture, all the rain?
 BERNHARD LANGER: You know, I don't know, I'm not an expert in whatever, on these greens here. Probably a lot to do with the moisture and the heat. I guess this kind of grass they have to keep it moist, otherwise it might die, and then they had a lot of rain anyways a few days ago. A combination of that. 

 Q. Did you feel like your game was -- maybe the ball-striking was coming around and you played okay --
 BERNHARD LANGER: Well, it was lacking a little bit in all areas. My ball-striking wasn't quite good enough, my short game wasn't quite there, and my putting wasn't quite there, so it's just 10 percent everywhere, and all of a sudden you lose six to ten shots.

 Q. How's the form?
 BERNHARD LANGER: It didn't get any worse. It didn't get better, but I played three weeks in a row, which is a lot of golf, three majors, and it didn't get any worse, so that's encouraging for me. But it still needs to improve.
