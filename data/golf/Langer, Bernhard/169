 Q. Are you going to play at the Senior British?
 BERNHARD LANGER: Yes. 

 Q. I just wanted your thoughts on the Sunningdale and looking forward to the week. 
 BERNHARD LANGER: Sunningdale is one of the old, classic golf courses that we have in Great Britain. A lot of tournaments have been played there. 
 I've won the European Open some years ago there and so I played a couple other events there. It's built on sand and usually it's in very good condition, good soil. And it should be a great venue for the British Senior Open.
