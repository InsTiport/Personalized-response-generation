 Q.   Take us through the ace on 17.   
GIULIA MOLINARO:   Well, I hit second and‑‑ I just stared at the car‑‑ really nice car but I didn't think of it.   Just went and hit an 8‑iron and I hit it and I saw it land and went in, and the first reaction was like, oh, great, hole‑in‑one.   
Then it clicked that it actually was a car, so I think I screamed car in Italian.   It was great, a great feeling and good to finish the day like that and obviously it's a lot of luck, especially when there's a car involved.   So I'm very happy.   It's been a good week.   Monday qualified in and got the car, so that's pretty good.   Can't complain.  
   
 Q.   So you were actually able to see the ball go in the hole then?  
GIULIA MOLINARO:   Yeah, I saw the ball go in the hole.   I saw something white hit and it was really close and disappeared, and I figured‑‑ then people started clapping so I figured it was in.  
   
 Q.   How many holes in one does this make for you?  
GIULIA MOLINARO:   My second on the LPGA.   I had one last year in Alabama and I think it's fourth in my life.   
   
 Q.   Does it mean anything more to you coming in your adopted hometown area?   
GIULIA MOLINARO:   Of course it means more.   I mean, I love living here and I love how close I am to ASU and how close I've become to the school and how strong I feel for it.   It's obviously a great feel to play at home and Justine the fact that I'm sleeping in my own bed and everything is so much easier.   It's an honor to play any event but when it's back home, it's a bit more special.  
   
 Q.   Where do you live in the Phoenix area?  
GIULIA MOLINARO:   Upper Grayhawk.
