Q. I notice there's a late change to your caddie selection. Was that a last‑minute decision that you brought your sister?
GIULIA MOLINARO: Well, I've been changing caddies this year and I put Sophia, my sister, as a backup, in case the caddie I was with was not working out. In golf, unfortunately things change and caddies change, even though I'm a big believer that the best thing is to stick with one caddie for a very long time. 
But it's not that things didn't exactly work out, but I just felt like it was such a once‑in‑a‑lifetime opportunity that I would love to share it with my sister. So we can remember it like something that we did together forever.

Q. Has she ever caddied for you before?
GIULIA MOLINARO: No, she hasn't. But she's a player, so she knows. She played college golf in the U.S. She went to SCAD, an art school in Savannah, Georgia. 

Q. How special is it to be able to share this experience together?
GIULIA MOLINARO: It's been great. Up to now, it's been just unreal, the village life and seeing all the best athletes in the world. The tournament is going to be fun, so I'm looking forward to starting tomorrow. But so far, it's just a once‑in‑a‑lifetime experience, and probably the best time I've ever had. 

Q. How old is your sister? Is she younger than you? 
GIULIA MOLINARO: Yeah. She's 22 years old. 

Q. Any expectations for the tournament? 
GIULIA MOLINARO: I mean, I came in with very, very low expectations, because of the calibre of the tournament and I just don't want to put extra pressure on myself that I don't really need to. But I see the course and I love the course and I'm feeling good and I feel like I'm playing really well. 
I expect a little bit more now than I did at the beginning of the week, but I'm still here to enjoy it and just give my best and have fun doing it.
