DANA VON LOUDA:  Heather, today a 65, 12 under total and you currently have a one shot lead.  You must be very happy about that.
HEATHER BOWIE:   For sure, but I'm very happy with the way I played the first three days.

Obviously, I got it up and down, made lots of birdies and three bogeys.  I just putted the best I've ever putted.  I made a lot of 15  , 20 foot birdie putts that I typically haven't had a round where I've made a lot of those.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Let's go over your card.
HEATHER BOWIE:   1, I hit a driver and a 5 wood to about 25 feet, made the putt.

Second hole I hit a bunker shot to 15 feet and made the putt, 4 iron into the bunker.

3, I hit driver off the tee and hit it in the rough and had a sand wedge that I hit in the green and rolled over into the back bunker and I did not get up and down.

5, I hit a 9 iron to about 25 feet.

7 iron to about ten feet.

9, I hit a driver off the tee there and chipped to about 12 feet and made that putt.

10, hit a 5 wood over the green and 2 putted from 20 feet.

11, hit a lob wedge; didn't get up and down.

I hit 6 iron to about three feet on the par  3 12.

15, I hit a 5 wood there to 20 feet.

16, I hit a 5 iron to 15 feet.

18, I missed the green left with a 5 iron and did not get up and down.

How many pars did I make?  Not many.  Six pars.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Can you talk about the course conditions?
HEATHER BOWIE:   Well, the course was playing fast but the greens were still holding which is definitely an advantage.
Q.  You played well in this event last year?
HEATHER BOWIE:   I played very well the second round in Turnberry, to make the cut on the number and finish it up.
Q.  What were your expectations coming into this week?
HEATHER BOWIE:   I think it's very difficult but I don't have very high expectations.  I try to stay very level because you can make a ton of birdies and you can make a ton of bogeys and you're playing about the same.  But I don't get real excited when I get going well and I try not to get too down when I'm not.
Q.  Does todayÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s round change your expectations going into the final round?
HEATHER BOWIE:   Well, my expectations, I really didn't have any .  I didn't think about the outcome at all.  I think that it takes so much out of you on each hole that I really, I don't even find myself ever thinking ahead.  Like if I'm on 13, I'm not thinking about 14; whereas sometimes I do, I'll think "birdie hole is coming up."  But here you have to really stay in the present.  And I don't think I really have any expectations at all coming over, which is neither negative or positive.  I was just really trying to figure out how I was going to play each hole.
Q.  You did well last year.
HEATHER BOWIE:   Well, you know, I was the leader last year after two rounds and didn't play very well on Saturday.  So Saturday is usually a difficult day for me.  I was happy to get through today and I feel that tomorrow I will be nervous, but, you know, it's a great position to be in.  I'm looking forward to seeing if I'm up to the challenge.
Q.  You have a Scottish grandmother?
HEATHER BOWIE:   I think it was last year actually at Lytham.  I had to ask her where my family was from and she finally found out it was the Isle of Sky.
Q.  Have you prepared the same this year as you have in the past by going to Long Island before this event?
HEATHER BOWIE:   I did do it again this year.  My teacher is at Firestone (phonetic) and I went there the week after the U.S. Open and practiced and I'm actually headed back there from here.  We are going to go and play one event and go back.  I did do the same thing because I felt it helped me last time.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Thank you very much.
