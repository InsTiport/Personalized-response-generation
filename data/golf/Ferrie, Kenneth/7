KENNETH FERRIE:  The greens have been very inconsistent during practice.  I didn't play on Monday.  The guys were saying they were very, very quick on Monday afternoon.  I played with Warren Bladon who said that on Tuesday morning.  And he said the greens weren't as quick as they were the night before.

The course is very fast running but the greens are quite slow.  I see a lot of people leaving putts short.

My game generally was okay.  My putting was dreadful.  I had three birdies but one was a two putt.  One was an eight footer and the other one just off the back of the par 5, 16th, and two putted that, as well.  I chipped it to a foot and holed that.

I'm not really interested in just making the cut.  I need to go out there and play well, do what I can do.  It's hard to shoot a score when you know you're not in contention.
