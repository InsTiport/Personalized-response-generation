Q. You must be pleased with a good start to the week?

A. Yes, it is kind of the way I have been playing for a while. I have had a couple of breaks that haven't been going for me the last couple of weeks but it was a nice start. I was a little bit disappointed not to finish it off but in the first round it is always nice to get off to a good start.
Q. Did you have chances on the last two?

A. I had chances most of the way really. I three putted the 12th, the par five, and had an eight footer from the back of the green at the 14th as well and missed that. The only bad drive I hit all day was at the 15th which is the one hole you really can't afford to and so a five was what I deserved and what I got and then I had half chances at the last two. A little disappointed to only shoot three under but at the same time with the changes to the course, the scoring kind of reflects that. But if I keep doing what I'm doing, I should be all right.
Q. A good performance as well after what I presume have been an upsetting few days for you?

A. I don't want to talk about that. Whatever happened last week happened last week. If you want to ask me any questions about my round today I have no qualms about standing here all day. But what happened last week, happened last week.
Q. But that's what I'm saying, it was a good round in the circumstances?

A. Well regardless of how I played today, it is nothing to do with what happened last week. What happened last week has been put totally to the back of my mind. It was an unfortunate situation which I have learned a valuable lesson from. I am a golfer, that is what I am, I'm not aÃ¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦
Q. Politician?

A. Exactly, and I think nobody who knows me would say I would make a good one of those! I am a golfer and that is what I have come to do this week and, like I say, I am pleased with my start and hopefully I can keep it going all week.
Q. A believe you got closure on it at least, by writing to Paul McGinley.

AÃ¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦Ã¢ï¿½ ¦anything else? As I've just explained, I have nothing to say about what happened last week.
Q. Have you had a run of consistency like this before?

A. It is kind of the way that my game goes. My game is based, loosely, on that of Colin Montgomerie's. It is fairways and greens and if the putter doesn't work, then the scores don't come. It is a bit disappointing at times because I feel like I am doing what I need to be doing and I am approaching things the right way and it is very frustrating and disappointing when you do things right and you don't feel you get the rewards you feel you deserve. It is kind of plodding on and hoping that the light at the end of the tunnel comes sooner rather than later. In this game that is the way it kind of goes, you usually have your better finishes when you least expect them. You can have good finishes from nowhere sometimes. Last year going into the K Club I wasn't really showing anything, even though I thought I was doing everything right. I think a lot of people looked at that and thought it was maybe a lucky week and maybe it was, but you can only do what you feel as though you need to do and I feel I am doing everything I need to be doing and I am hoping that if I keep playing the way that I am playing then things can click.
Q. How often does the Ryder Cup cross your mind?

A. Every time you guys mention it! No, it is one of those things. It is a huge thing for any golfer, that is the goal to play in that and it is the byproduct of playing very good golf for a long time other than just the odd good week. It is in my mind quite a lot but there is still a long way to go. I got off to a great start but if you look at it now I think I'm 12th on the list and I am two places outside of getting in and even then I am quite a long way off getting in. So I need to keep on doing what I am doing but the guys who will get in the team are the guys who will do well in the bigger events. There are plenty of guysÃ¢ï¿½ ¦..Nick Dougherty has had five top tens since the start of last year and only one of them has been worth any sort of money, the rest have all been twenty, thirty grand which is nice if you can do that in your average weeks but I think in the big picture it is playing well at the right times that counts. You won't get many people in the team who haven't played well in the big events. Look at Thomas last week who has come from nowhere really, wins the Irish Open which is one of the bigger events and all of a sudden he is right in contention. So for me it is just onwards and upwards and if it happens it happens and if it doesn't, then I am only 27 years old and I will hopefully have some other chances to do it.
