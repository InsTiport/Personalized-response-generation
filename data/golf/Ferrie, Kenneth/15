KENNETH FERRIE:  A round of golf involves playing 18 holes so no matter what I did earlier, it wasn't an impressive finish. In my mind it was an impressive nine holes but not an impressive round of golf.

I would have taken this position before I started out yesterday morning but I definitely wouldn't have taken it after nine holes today. Regardless of where I am at the end of this round, I know that I've left a bundle of shots out there.

The hole-in-one was just a good four iron. A good shot but holes in one are just lucky. People play their whole lives without getting one. I've had about six or seven now and two in competition. I had one in the Spanish Open a few years ago.
