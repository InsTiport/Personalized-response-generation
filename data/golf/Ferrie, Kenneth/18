Q. Reaction to that?
KENNETH FERRIE:  That's what happens when you are playing against one of the best players in the world. He was just holing everything out there today and you have to do that if you are going to be one of the best players in the world.
Q. You played well this morning?
KENNETH FERRIE:  Yes and no. I mean the scorecard probably looked alright but I just never really hit it inside him and he was always having three putts for the hole or he was putting it to 15 and 20 feet and I was always a few feet behind him so he was always putting for the hole. As good a putter as he is, he is always going to hole a few of those and he holed more than his fair share today. That kind of continued into the afternoon -- he holed from 20 feet again at the first and that set the tone for the day.
Q. Good experience for you?
KENNETH FERRIE:  It's one of those tournaments that you want to play in every year. It's been alright but to get beaten the way I did it's hard to say that you have learned a lot and it's been good experience.
