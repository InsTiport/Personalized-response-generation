Q. Jason, great way to start the tournament.  6-under for your first round, six birdies, no bogeys.  What was working for you?JASON GORE: I hit it really well.  I think I missed two fairways and two greens and both of the fairways I missed was on 15.  The last one was on 9.  I just drove it and hit a great drive and hit through the fairway.  So just hit it really good.  Missed a couple shorties. You always say it could have been that much better, but I made one I shouldn't have.  So Thursday is over and we go to tomorrow.Q. How about the course conditions for round one?  Lot of guys raving about the greens and their consistency and the way they were rolling?JASON GORE: Yeah, they were very, very good.  Just typical afternoon.  They had some footprints on them, but all in all they were tremendous.  Looking forward to getting on some fresh ones tomorrow.
