 Q.  Jason, many seasons in two days.  Thoughts on today's round?  
JASON GORE: It was a good round.  I mean, I hit it pretty well.  I didn't miss a fairway again today.  Any time you can get your hand on the ball when the ball is in hand a lot that's good.   
So just kind of got a bad break on 8.  I thought I hit a really good second shot in there and then (outside noise disturbance) buried in the hill and then had to go back to where I was and made bogey.   
A little lack of concentration and missed like a four-footer our something like that.   
Other than that, birdied 10, which was a great birdie.  I think it might be a (indiscernible) today.   
Then just kind of got it rolling from there.  Kept hitting good shots and rolled in a few putts.
