 Q.  Club selection first, thoughts on what you were planning to do.  
JASON GORE: I had 2-iron out and Scotty talked me into hitting 3-wood.  He said, just a nice big cut 3-wood, and he was right.   
 Q.  We saw your reaction on TV, but did you see it?  
JASON GORE: We could see it.  Once it hit the green and started rolling up the hill, I'm thinking, oh, this is going to be really close and then just saw it kind of disappear.  And it was pretty fun.   
 Q.  As far as shots that you can remember, obviously fans went crazy over that shot, will this stick out to you?  
JASON GORE: Oh, yeah.  That will be a good one for awhile.  That will be a good one for awhile.  Until I forget.
