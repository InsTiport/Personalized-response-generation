 Q.  Gotta think exactly what you were looking for today, bogey-free, getting right back into contention.  
JASON GORE: Yeah, especially after the start I had yesterday.  Had three bogeys early and that's the great part about this format.  I had an eagle on 13 and all of a sudden right back in it and make a few birdies, and bang.   
 Q.  You're a guy that likes to fire at pins.  I would think this format kind of fits you perfectly, to be aggressive and go at everything?  
JASON GORE: Yeah, I mean, you would think so.  It's a fun format.  Every week we play the same, 72 holes of stroke play.  And for me it's 36 holes of stroke play.   
But, yeah, it's fun to get a little change of pace and have a little different format.   
 Q.  Birdies on three of the first four, got started early today?  
JASON GORE: Yeah, it was a good start.  And just had good looks and took advantage of it.   
 Q.  What was the difference between today and yesterday, was it anything ball-striking-wise or anything?  
JASON GORE: Actually didn't hit it as good today as I did yesterday.  And I just made a few putts and didn't do anything really stupid and got a few good breaks and attitude stayed well and stayed good and positive and kept moving forward.   
 Q.  Is this a golf course you like?  
JASON GORE: Very much so.  I think it's fun.  I think it's challenging.  You gotta keep your head on the swivel around here with the changing winds and swirling winds and the altitude changes, gotta stay on your toes around here.   
 Q.  You've played here quite a bit.  Does that experience help you this weekend?  
JASON GORE: Yes, very much.  It's similar grasses to what I play on at home.  So it's very familiar.
