 Q.   Jason, you had a good round, some good golf out there, 5‑under, tied for third right now.   Tell me a little bit about your round.   
JASON GORE:   I played really solid, made a few key putts, just little five, six‑footers that you need to make to keep the round going.   Other than that, I hit it really solid and really well.   
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about your experience with this course.   
JASON GORE:   I haven't had much luck here, actually.   I don't think I've ever made the cut.   I don't know.   All these years kind of run together.   I think it's a good thing if I ever made a cut I don't remember.   I've always liked the course; I think it's great.   It's straightforward, it's difficult, you just have to hit good shots.   There's nothing goofy about it.   It's a good test of golf.  
   
 Q.   There's always a wind factor here.   How did that treat you today?  
JASON GORE:   It keeps you cool.   It's a pleasant wind, because the golf course is designed for this wind.   You just kind of have to play your shots and take a few extra clubs and get through it.   I grew up at a place where it's pretty windy, so I like it.   
   
 Q.   Puerto Rico, how are you liking it?   It's a lot warmer than the rest of the U.S. ?  
JASON GORE:   Puerto Rico is awesome.   It's a beautiful place, and I love coming here for sure.   I think we're going to venture out on the town to see what we can find.   We can go have a little lunch somewhere.   But it's a great resort and just love being here.
