   JASON GORE: The golf course played tough.

 Q. You're still in the final group tomorrow. You'll be many shots back. What will be your objective mindset heading into tomorrow?
 JASON GORE: Just going out and keep doing the same thing. I felt like I hit some great shots, but you've just got to keep moving forward, stay focused. Sean is obviously playing great, so you just go out there and play hard and see what happens. 

 Q. What will the damp golf course do tomorrow? 
 JASON GORE: Well, it's definitely going to make the greens a lot easier to hit shots into for sure. It's going to play longer, and I don't know what the wind is supposed to do, but the wind is brutal out there. Maybe if the wind dies down a little bit it'll probably be susceptible to a few more birdies.
