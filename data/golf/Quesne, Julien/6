Q.   How do you feel about that start? 
JULIEN QUESNE:   Quite happy with this first round.   Played good golf today, and had a good attitude and we'll see for the rest of the week.

Q.   Seemed like birdie after birdie after birdie, so many chances. 
JULIEN QUESNE:   I had many chances, many birdie putts, but I didn't hole many putts.   I hit a good wedge on the third hole I think for an eagle, so that was good. 

Q.   Tell us about that, how far out were you? 
JULIEN QUESNE:   132 meters I think. 

Q.   Which is a beautiful, lovely 2 that really kickâ€‘starts your round?
JULIEN QUESNE:   Yeah, it helped, it helped to keep playing good and have a good attitude. 

Q.   I'm sure the answer is obvious, but do you like it here?   Do you like the sunshine? 
JULIEN QUESNE:   Yeah, yeah, we come in Portugal for the sunshine.   We like it. 

Q.   It's a relaxed week? 
JULIEN QUESNE:   Yeah, yeah, more relaxed than the beginning of the season or in August.   But keep playing well, and just try to do my best and maybe have some good tournaments towards the end of the season. 

Q.   Do you actually feel a change in yourself having won in Italy?   Has it just changed your approach? 
JULIEN QUESNE:   A little bit, yeah.   Less stress than before.   A little bit less stress.   But I need the stress to play good.
