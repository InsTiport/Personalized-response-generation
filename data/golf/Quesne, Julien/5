  JULIEN QUESNE:   Yeah, I'm very proud about the score.   It was a nice day for me today.   I holed a few putts.

Q.   On 9, everything looked so well and then a double‑bogey.   Not the way that you would like to finish a round. 
JULIEN QUESNE:   Yeah, I miss one shot and recovered. 

Q.   And the eagle on 17, did you try to go for it?
JULIEN QUESNE:   No, I didn't try to reach the green.   I played the lay‑up on the left and I had 95 metres for the flag and just holed a sand wedge.   Just perfect. 

Q.   There are a lot of low scores in general; does it surprise you? 
JULIEN QUESNE:   No, because the course is in very good conditions.   Greens are soft, so if you play well, you can make some birdies. 

Q.   Looking forward to tomorrow? 
JULIEN QUESNE:   Yeah, I am.   I will try to do the same tomorrow.
