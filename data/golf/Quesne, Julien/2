JULIEN QUESNE: You look at my smile, yeah, I think it's my best round here.  It's my third time here in the final and it's my best score ever, so it's very good.
Q. And four birdies in the last five holes, what happened there?
JULIEN QUESNE: I make a lucky birdie on the 15th -- 14th, the little par 4, just a recovery shot and the ball finished three meters from the flag, and I was hoping to have a par here and make birdie here.  So it was good.  And I make a two meters putt on 17 and a two meters putt on 18, so my putting was good today.  So I'm happy with that.
Q. What has made the difference from South Africa last week?
JULIEN QUESNE: Maybe more than ten shots, I don't know.  My game was not so bad last week, but the course was tough with the rough and greens, and I don't like the greens last week.  I prefer this one here and I think my attitude was not good last week, so that's why I miss it.
Q. And does the fact that you know this course from previous years does that help, as well?
JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, a lot.  A lot, because I know it's a tough one.  I know that my best round here is around 2-under, something like this.  So I look less expectative, so that's why I think I enjoy more here, yeah.
Q. We come to the end of The European Tour season, or at least we will in another three days.  Do you reflect on the year?  How has your year been?
JULIEN QUESNE: A little bit like this, but in the end, very good, because I'm here for the third time, so I'm quite happy about that.
