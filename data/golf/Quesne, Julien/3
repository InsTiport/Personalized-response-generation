 Q.  Thoughts on a good finish in a championship you came so close in?  
JULIEN QUESNE: I played good golf today, like yesterday, I missed maybe some few putts.  But I finish top five here, so it's a great week, and playing amazing golf.   
 Q.  Must have been so exciting when you started the way you did with those birdies early on.  
JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, I make a good start, so it helps.  And I played very good, I'm very happy, I enjoy a lot.  We'll see next year.   
 Q.  It's a nice step up from last year where you played well here; who knows what can happen next year?  
JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, maybe.  I finish eight last year, four today.  Maybe next year.   
 Q.  Is this good for the rest of the season to have this kind of platform at a big event?  
JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, it's a great tournament.  We enjoy a lot I think here.  There was a lot of people around the course and they all support me and Chris.  It was a great week.   
 Q.  You did play alongside the champion, so please tell us how well he played to deserve this title.  
JULIEN QUESNE: I was telling my caddie over the first nine holes, every shot he made, I was telling him, wow, he was playing very, very good golf.  He deserved perfect shot for all of the flags and putting very good and everything's good.  I'm happy for him.
