JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, it's a good one.  I played good golf today.  Win four and three.   
 Q.  And good right from the start of that match?  
JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, because he start very good with two birdies in the first three holes I think.  So I was 2-down, and I just keep playing well and I make maybe four birdies after that.  So, I'm happy.   
 Q.  One of those courses where you can see plenty of chances, I guess.  Or maybe not.  
JULIEN QUESNE: No, because the wind is very strong.  So we need to hit some good shots to have birdie position and putting with this wind is not very easy.   
 Q.  Is it exciting, being in the last 16 and knowing you've got Chris Wood to play?  
JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, yeah, I'm very excited about that, because yeah, we are 16 players now.  So it's good to be inside the 16 players.   
 Q.  And does it matter who you play next?  
JULIEN QUESNE: Yes, but Chris Wood is a very good player, so I think it will be hard tomorrow.  But I will do my best.
