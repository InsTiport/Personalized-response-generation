Q. Interesting reaction from you at the end?
JULIEN QUESNE: Yes, this day was amazing for me because the game is very good.  Today I just holed some putts, so that makes the difference.
Q. Been quite a disappointing run for you this season.  What's been the difference in the game this week?
JULIEN QUESNE: I don't know, I think I've had some technique problems.  Like the face closed on the top of the backswing, something like that, and my game was not good.
It's coming better since two weeks, so I hope the season begins now.
Q. You had a fantastic run of birdies on the back, four in a row, five in six holes.  It's always nice to get that kind of run going.
JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, I enjoy a lot.  I hit so many good shots.  This course is so nice, obviously, and to play nice on this kind of course is even better.
Q. And of course in a Rolex Series event, as well, how nice would it be to get a good finish here this week with all the ranking points available?
JULIEN QUESNE: Yeah, it's better to do it this week.  So I hope tomorrow will be good, also.  Just focus on tomorrow and we will see.
