 Q.   You've gone well this week.   How do you reflect on the three days so far and in particular this third day?   
JULIAN QUESNE:   Very happy with my game.   I enjoy a lot today more than the past two days.   I make nine birdies today.   
   
 Q.   It could have been so much better, you were really moving up that board?  
JULIAN QUESNE:   Yeah, we've been not lucky on 16 and 17 because we have a lot of wind.   I make two bogeys, but a birdie at the final was very good.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you've got a good chance going into the last day knowing that Scott Jamieson is very much in control at the moment?   
JULIAN QUESNE:   I hope so.   I will try.   With the rain, with the wind we never know.   I will do my best tomorrow so we'll see.  
   
 Q.   What's working for you this week?   
JULIAN QUESNE:   Everything.   I hit the ball very good.   My driving is very good.   I hit a lot of fairways and my putting is much better than usual.
