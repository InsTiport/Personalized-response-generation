Q.   Julian, congratulations first of all for the victory last week, and apparently you took your form from last week into this week, 6‑under par today, a very good round, put you at 9‑under after two rounds.   How do you feel? 
JULIAN QUESNE:   I feel good.   Conditions are perfect, so need to make a lot of birdies.   My game is good.   Just need some more putts maybe. 

Q.   Being at 9‑under par now after two rounds, you'll be playing St. Andrews tomorrow; how do you feel being at 9‑under? 
JULIAN QUESNE:   I'm quite happy about the score.   But I'm four shots behind the leader, so still a chance. 

Q.   Just the third round tomorrow, what are your preparations going to be like today?   Are you going to go to the driving range? 
JULIAN QUESNE:   No, no, just have some rest.   You know, it's my sixth tournament in a row, so I'm not in very good form and I need to calm down.
