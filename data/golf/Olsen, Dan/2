 Q. Talk about the experience, how is the course playing and how do you feel the round went just overall? 
 DAN OLSEN: Well, you know, you're going to pay for mistakes and you have to be sharp to play here. 
 So I think the top players in the world are probably sharp and it's a great course for them. Good championship. 

 Q. Is the course playing like it did during the practice rounds? 
 DAN OLSEN: Yeah, pretty much. I don't see any difference really.

 Q. No problems with 14 or 17, the green issue? 
 DAN OLSEN: No, that wasn't a big deal. I mean, I almost had it affect a chip I was going to play but not really. 

 Q. What are your expectations for tomorrow?
 DAN OLSEN: Just try to play well, avoid some mistakes. That's what I'll do.
