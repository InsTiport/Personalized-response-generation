 Q. Just talk about the day, how you played, how you feel about it. 
 MARK WIEBE: Well, it was a struggle today for sure. I got off to a decent start, but I made a bogey and a double bogey on 13 and 14, and then I bogeyed 16, so I was 3-over on my round and 1-under for the tournament. And it was a battle from then. But the course played harder, the tees were back on some holes, and the course played harder for sure. So I'm happy with even par today. 

 Q. What adjustments do you think you have to make for tomorrow?
 MARK WIEBE: Well, I need to probably not make some stupid mistakes like I did today and try to just keep hitting it on the fairway and on the green and be patient because it's hot.

 Q. Was it more physical or mental today?
 MARK WIEBE: No, it was mental. I made a couple bonehead moves and I learned from them and stopped making them.
