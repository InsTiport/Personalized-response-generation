 Q. The curse of the 18th hole, striking right at the end?
 MARK WIEBE: You know, the last three holes -- actually, the last four holes are really tough. You know, 18 is just a hard hole. I hit a great drive and had a 2-iron in. Then I had a hard bunker shot, but, you know, I'm happy with the way I played. I felt like I played pretty well, and you have to know that they are going to play hard at the end. So they played hard at the end. 

 Q. What would you say was the pick of your birdies today?
 MARK WIEBE: I really liked the birdie on 17. I hit it pretty close to the hole. I hit a 3-iron off the tee and I hit a 6-iron ten or 12 feet. That was probably my favourite birdie today, because it's a hard hole, also, and it balanced out my bogey on 18. 

 Q. As far as general conditions, a bit of breeze, how is that affecting things? 
 MARK WIEBE: They call this a little breeze? 
 The course played hard. I putted well today. There's no doubt about it. But I think the course is hard if theres with a no breeze, so you put a little wind in there, it makes it play tough. Even downwind holes, it's tough to know what club to hit or how much roll you're going to get, bounce, or if you hit against the wind it's not going to go as far obviously. It made it just tricky. It's not terrible but there's enough. 

 Q. Not too many players in red figures come the end of the first day?
 MARK WIEBE: I haven't really paid attention to tell you the truth. I was kind of busy doing my own thing trying to not bogey. 
 But, you know, it's a hard golf course, and I guess they call it Carnasty for a reason. If there's too many red numbers, it will come back and get us tomorrow.
