Q.   Talk about how this has mapped out in the twilight here?
MARK WIEBE:   Wild, right.   I don't know what to say.   I really thought I had great chances, with birdies on 15, 16, 17 and 18, and I didn't come away with any.   And I know what kind of player Bernie is.   But I was surprised‑‑ and then playing in the dark is a new one for me, really dark.   I was hoping that one of us would bogey or something so we could move on. 
But, it's a never‑ending day and it's going to continue tomorrow at 8.00.

Q.   So you've never had a situation where you've gone out with the headlights on the buggy and tried to find an orange ball somewhere?
MARK WIEBE:   Yeah, but I was younger and not as a professional.   We used to do that stuff because it was fun. 
I think it's probably pretty fair that we both made pars, because it was dark, and that's not‑‑ we want to have a true champion here, I would imagine, and not that either of us aren't, but I think it's nice to play with sun out. 

Q.   And a challenge to go back down the hole for a second time; presumably you could not see an awful lot. 
MARK WIEBE:   All I was thinking, my flight's at 9.15 tomorrow, and if we could get one more hole in, and Bernie said sure‑‑ but we never saw tee shots.   We never saw second shots. 
And the putt, luckily it was where I was the first hole of the playoff, or I would have had no idea.   You know, it's just kind of a weird happening here, a weird run of events. 

Q.   Well, it will all add to the memory or the history coming. 
MARK WIEBE:   Yeah, hopefully we'll figure it out tomorrow.
