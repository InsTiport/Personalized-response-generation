 Q. Do you have any different mind set as you were leading going into Round 2?
 KRIS BLANKS: It's obviously new. I've never been in that situation before, but I felt pretty calm when I teed off. It wasn't like I was nervous and obviously we're still talking about Friday. There's a long way to go in the tournament. I had people asking me about if I had my passport. You know, you're only a few bogeys away from being in 30th place. Obviously I'm still in the top ten right now, but I'm sure by the end of the day I'll be right around 16th, 17th and we'll have to do some work on the weekend.

 Q. And you're still there. 
 KRIS BLANKS: Yeah.

 Q. Just I guess how does this illustrate just the importance of that first round?
 KRIS BLANKS: Well, obviously the first round to get the low number under your belt. Obviously if I'd shot 5-under, 5-under I'd be two better than I was at this point. So it was good today not to shoot over par. Even though even par you're definitely going to lose spots out here. 
 But I'm still in decent shape. Obviously Chez is playing really good. You know, guys are going to take it low out here just because I mean we're all pretty good. So just have to go out tomorrow and make some more birdies. And just gotta hit it a little better. I didn't hit it very good today and got out of position a lot, so can't be too upset.

 Q. Course play much different today?
 KRIS BLANKS: No. The wind started picking up a little bit on the back nine, but the course played great. Played like it was all there in front of you. The pins were set up good. I just didn't execute my shots from the fairway very good today. So just going to work on it and get after it tomorrow. .
