 Q. Talk a little bit about playing in THE PLAYERS for the first time? 
 KRIS BLANKS: It's basically I wanted to hit two shots my whole life. I wanted to hit the tee shot off 16 at the FBR or the Waste Management tournament, and I wanted to hit the tee shot on 17 here at THE PLAYERS. Those are the two shots I've wanted to hit.

 Q. Have you played 17 yet in a practice round? 
 KRIS BLANKS: Yeah, I played a practice round.

 Q. How did you do the first time? 
 KRIS BLANKS: Yeah, it went in the water there. So that's promising. 
 I played out here a few times over the last couple of years. So it's a great test of golf. It's in wonderful shape.
