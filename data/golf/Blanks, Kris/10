  Q. 3-under 68, you're obviously getting the job done, halfway to working your way into next week. Just comments about the round as you're heading into Sunday and Monday.   
 KRIS BLANKS: Really I did extra this week, stayed here and practiced. I got here early, put in a lot of work on the range, implemented a new -- I don't want to say a new putting stroke, but I'm really thinking -- really my main focus for the next two days, obviously getting into the next tournament would be great. I'm really just trying to figure out how to win golf tournaments. I've got my card locked up for next year. That's kind of my main focus. I figure all the rest of it will take care of itself.  
  
  Q. A little bit different today than yesterday afternoon?  
 KRIS BLANKS: Yeah, I think the guys in our wave might have been playing a little bit downwind, so that actually helped us out. I think for me personally, I think we might have when it's all said and done had the best of both days.
