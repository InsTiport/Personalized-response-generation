  Q. Obviously a disappointing finish to the round but still in good shape given your situation.   
 CHRIS COUCH: No doubt. Made birdie on 17, so makes up for 18 a little bit. But 18 had my number this week. I'm 2 over on it. So hopefully this afternoon I can attack it and get a birdie or so out of it. But I played well all day.  
  
  Q. How much different was the course this morning compared to yesterday?   
 CHRIS COUCH: Man, it was perfect this morning. Barely any wind, nice and sunny. Couldn't ask for better conditions.   
 The greens are in perfect shape. They've kept this course in great shape for us, so it's good for scoring out there.  
  
  Q. Your situation, having to make a certain amount of money. You're in good shape to achieve that this afternoon. What would that mean for you to get that done this week?   
 CHRIS COUCH: It would definitely be a weight off my shoulders. I'm trying not to think about it. Just going to go out there and continue to have fun this afternoon and see what happens.  
  
  Q. You must enjoy coming back here being a past champion?  
 CHRIS COUCH: No doubt. I love it out here, people are great, fans are great, and it's nice to be back.
