 Q.   Nice par save at the last to keep a pretty good number together headed to the weekend?  
CHRIS COUCH:   No doubt.   I hit it good all day today, and hit a good shot there on 9.   Don't know what happened; miss‑club.   But a great par save.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the golf course today.   More difficult?   The scores do not seem to be as low.   I mean, we are not talking about PÃ¡draig's crazy round but did not seem to be as many 4s and 5s.   3‑under looks like a pretty nice number?  
CHRIS COUCH:   You said it right when you said PÃ¡draig's crazy for.   I tell you what, that was something.   I just don't see a 61 out here.   You know, this is a good golf course.   You have to drive it well and you have to hit your irons well, and the greens are tough, especially the finishing holes.   You have to keep it together.  
   
 Q.   Usually better conditions in the morning than the afternoon; did the course play tougher?   
CHRIS COUCH:   I think so.   You know, a couple tougher pins.   Course played a little longer today.   So you know, with this wind, it's tough, because a couple of par 5s are into the wind and you can't get home, and you are going to see little higher scores.  
   
 Q.   Been a tough start for you this year.   What have you found that is now working?   
CHRIS COUCH:   I've been struggling with the putter all year.   I have been hitting it well all year and I feel like my game is right there, but the putter has not been there for me and I've been working really hard on my putting.   So hopefully will see some results on the weekend.   
   
 Q.   They gave you an early tee time today so you could go watch the Gators this afternoon if you want?  
CHRIS COUCH:   Looking forward to it.   Two o'clock.  
   
 Q.   High expectations?  
CHRIS COUCH:   I'm hoping.   You know, a lot of good teams out there.   I think we have got a lot of talent on our team, so in the Tournament, you never know.
