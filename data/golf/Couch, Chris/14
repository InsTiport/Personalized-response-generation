   CHRIS COUCH:  These greens are tough.  It's a little bit Mickey Mouse out there at times.  I mean, I hit a chip today that broke about 45 feet.  So, you know, you've just got to play the hills and make them be your friend I guess.   
  
  Q.  You look really comfortable over the 4- and 5-footers on the way in, that has to feel good.   
 CHRIS COUCH:  Yeah, definitely did.  That's kind of where I've been struggling scoring this year is around the greens.  And today it was nice, I made all of my 4- or 5-footers.  I think I only missed one inside four feet.   
 Played really good, made a couple long putts and just played solid all day.  I stayed patient, hit a lot of greens, and that's what you have to do out here.   
  
  Q.  This is a golf course that not too many people know a whole lot about.  You, on the other hand, you've always been considered a bomber.  Is this a bomber's course?   
 CHRIS COUCH:  At times.  I hit a lot of 3-woods today.  The desert comes in at times where I can't hit driver.  It's just placement out here.    
I hit a lot of 6-, 7-, 8-irons into the greens.  Just have to stay patient out here and hit fairways and greens.   
  
  Q.  With the win last year, you're really working hard toward the end of the year, trying to get something going to start next year off?   
 CHRIS COUCH:  I haven't had the year I wanted this year.  I played a lot better than what it shows on the Money List, and it's kind of frustrating.    
You know, I've been working really hard.  I came out here last week and practiced just about every day out here, so I got to learn the course a little bit and hopefully that will help out here.  I think knowledge out here definitely helps.
