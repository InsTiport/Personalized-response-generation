Q.   How good a round is that today from indifferent scores after the first two days?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   I played solid the first two days, too.   So today just seemed to hit it a little bit closer and make a few more putts, but still a pretty good score.

Q.   Was that the key, knocking yourself close? 
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   I played the par 5s, I think I played them in 4‑under.   Hit a couple on for two, so that helps, easy two putts for birdies.   I had one 3‑putt out there, so you know, you always feel like you could have shot one or two less but I'm very pleased with 7‑under. 

Q.   Did you get the sense of building some momentum and moving up the board?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   I just tried not to think about it just try and birdie every hole out there.   Now I'm so far behind and to have any sort of chance tomorrow, you know, I knew I had to shoot a low one but I just tried to make birdies.

Q.   Your caddie yesterday came in and said, have we made it, have we made it, there's a doubt so presumably there's a sense of relief when you can get on this things again?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   Almost when you make the cut‑‑ it looked like I was missing it for 35 holes until I birdied the last hole, so you almost feel like you have nothing to lose.   Then I birdied the first three holes and set the pace for a good days. 

Q.   Nice continuation of your form?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   Yeah, seems like it comes and goes but for the most part seems like it's in good form.
