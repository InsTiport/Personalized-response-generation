Q.   4â€‘under is a decent start around a championship like this? 
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   Yeah, this golf course is extremely tough.   Anything under par I think is a good score. 

Q.   Difficult, and it was difficult in Durban last week but markedly different courses?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   Yeah, totally different but they are both difficult.   There's just so much pressure and emphasis on hitting the fairway.   If you don't hit a fairway, you just take out your wedge and you can't get to the green.   The rough is tremendously tough, so it's important to get the ball in the fairway and from there, it's not all that hard. 

Q.   Do you feel the benefits of playing in Durban, and playing pretty well in Durban, as well? 
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   I mean, playing in the wind definitely helps, and getting a tournament under your belt, some of the guys haven't played for a couple of weeks.   So coming off a tournament, to know where your game is, that helps a lot, too. 

Q.   After the season that you had last year, when we saw you out on Tour, to achieve what you had done right at the start with that victory, do you have new aims and resolutions now that you're out on Tour like this? 
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   Yeah, definitely.   I've set my goals and I'm just trying to take it one tournament at a time.   I have goals after every week, so we'll see the end of the year if I achieve them or not. 

Q.   Presumably the goal is just aim high this week?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   Exactly, that's the goal. 

Q.   Any thoughts on your car? 
DAWIE VAN DER WALT:   Yeah, I'm still trying to negotiate with them to see if I can get an SUV in America, otherwise I might just have to take the cash.
