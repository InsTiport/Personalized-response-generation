Q. Great way to celebrate your birthday with a nice round.
DAWIE VAN DER WALT: How do you know it is my birthday?
Q. Somebody told me.
DAWIE VAN DER WALT: Well, thank you very much.
Q. What was the key to your round today?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT: I think I made a lot of putts.  I think I did well in strokes gained putting.  I had a couple of good wedges too.
Actually I got the tee shots in the fairway, and then hit a couple of wedges pretty close.  I left myself in pretty good spots.  These greens are pretty good.  If you leave yourself in the right spot, you can make some putts out here.
Q. So what is your key to playing well here out at Pebble Beach?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT: I don't know, it's only my second time here.  But today, like I said, I just hit a bunch of wedges close.  So it wasn't playing too hard, because there was no real wind.  But if you can get it in the fairway, you're going to have a lot of wedges around here.
Q. What's your mindset going forward for the rest of the weekend?
DAWIE VAN DER WALT: I just got to keep playing well.  We still have two more rounds.  My goal's ultimately to get in the top-10 so I can play next week.  I'm not in for next week, so I just got to keep playing well.
