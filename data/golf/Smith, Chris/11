Q.
Chris, you talked a lot yesterday about what it takes to kind of win a golf tournament.  What went right, what went wrong for you today?
CHRIS SMITH:  I played well.  Everything went pretty good.  I had two three putts on the par-3s on the back nine and those kind of kept me from winning.  But everything else I hit the ball really well and played really well.  Things went good.
Q.  What do you take away from today that carries into the end of the season?
CHRIS SMITH:  A job.  That's really all I'm taking a way from today is that I did accomplish what I needed to accomplish.  And I couldn't be much happier right now.
Q.  Just got off the phone with your wife.  Good conversation?
CHRIS SMITH:  Yeah, I think she was probably happier than I was.  Because the kids are very happy to, because we get to go back to Hawaii in January.

So it was a good phone call, it was a great week, and I played really well and I'm really happy with the way things turned out.
Q.  Congratulations and good luck next year.
CHRIS SMITH:  Thank you.
