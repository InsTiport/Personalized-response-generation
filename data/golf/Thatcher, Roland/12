 Q. Talk a little bit about playing at THE PLAYERS for the first time. 
 ROLAND THATCHER: Yeah, to be a part of the field, it's an honor, because this is our tournament. As a PGA TOUR player this is the one put on by our staff guys and our rules officials, and to be able to play the tournament that showcases what can happen here at our headquarters, it's an amazing feeling.

 Q. Anything can happen at this golf course and specifically those last few holes. Talk a little bit about those holes and the first time that you played them in a practice round. 
 ROLAND THATCHER: Yeah, coming up on some of the holes, they definitely had a little different look than I anticipated them having because I had only seen them on TV, and you notice the subtle changes that you wouldn't ordinarily notice. 
 Yeah, coming around to finishing 16 and seeing the island green, seeing probably one of the most famous holes in golf and getting a chance to play it is great. Tuesday and Wednesday it didn't really feel too stressful out there. It was just a pitching wedge or a 9-iron. I know it tends to mess with people's minds a little bit as the week goes farther on, so hopefully I'll handle it well.
