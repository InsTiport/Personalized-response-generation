 Q. Really long day today, 36 holes. Tell me about it. 
 ROLAND THATCHER: I don't think I was quite prepared for that this early in the season. I know I'm not alone in that, but I found myself out there struggling a little bit physically and mentally, and I'm sure others did, as well. Congratulations to Mark for getting past all that and playing a great 36 holes today.

 Q. A strong finish, though, and continuing momentum from the end of the year in 2010. Did you find that that momentum at the end of the year kind of carried you over into 2011 despite the fact that it was 36 holes today? 
 ROLAND THATCHER: Yeah, the momentum certainly carried me over the off-season which carried me over to a good week here. To be able to start off with a top 10 first week out of the gate was great. I would have loved to have done a few things better today, but really happy to have gotten four straight rounds under par today.

 Q. Any thoughts to take on to the next tournament?
 ROLAND THATCHER: Actually, no, I've got to get on the redeye and see four courses and tee it up on Wednesday. If I can get past all that hopefully I can ride a little momentum into there.
