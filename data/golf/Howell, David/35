 Q. Well down at the last. That was crucial and should keep you here for the weekend. 
 DAVID HOWELL: That was a big finish. I was going nicely, two under after nine, and then it all went wrong on the back nine. I hit it into the water at 16 and you think, 'I'm going home now'. But I managed to make a great birdie with my second ball and then a birdie at the last to make the cut on the mark is just what the doctor ordered. 

 Q. Missing out would have been particularly hard as you need the golf at the moment? 
 DAVID HOWELL: Absolutely and not only that I would have been very disappointed to miss the cut in that fashion, having looked to get myself in contention after nine holes. I was delighted to hole that putt. The other two tournaments I have missed (the cut) in Europe this year I have missed by a shot I think, so that would have been hard to take. 

 Q. Take me through what happened at 16? 
 DAVID HOWELL: I hit a terrible drive, hooked it into the water. It was that bad a shot I could not drop down there so I had to hit three off the tee. Hit a seven iron to 15 or 18 feet and managed to roll that in. Had about an eight footer at the last after another seven iron. It was a strong finish and a hell of a boost.
