DAVID HOWELL:  Yeah, I started off dodgy the first day, didn't quite do what I was working on with the coach, started that out after nine holes and played, for me, really well to be honest with you.  I had the loose shot here and there, but yeah, delighted.
Q.  I suppose that's to be expected after such a long time off.
DAVID HOWELL:  No, I'm swinging it well.  I wouldn't say I'm rusty.  I can hit the shots with maybe that bit of focus or swing easy just that little bit more, so no one or two bad swings a round makes a difference.

But yeah, great, and just made a great upÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½andÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½down there at the last, so fantastic.
Q.  What were you working on?
DAVID HOWELL:  I'm swinging beautifully with the irons and then the driver was going haywire.  Strangely I had to keep cupping my wrists, keeping the club face square at the top of the back swing with my driver, so that's a bit bizarre.  When I do it, it works really well.  I drove it great this week, got a new driver, so that helped.  So yeah, things are looking up.
Q.  Do you feel like you're back to where you were when things left off?
DAVID HOWELL:  I feel like I'm swinging it better.  I had that great run, but I was really getting good results, by I wasn't swinging it all that well.  It seems strange to say that.  I honestly wasn't.

Yeah, I'm hoping I can get straight back in the ring.
Q.  What's the schedule from here on out?
DAVID HOWELL:  Well, that might get me in the Match Play.  So I play next week, try and seal that position, and then I'm playing Switzerland, and if I do get in the Match Play, I'll miss the German Masters, I guess.
