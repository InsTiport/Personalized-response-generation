 Q.  Do you feel tired? 
 DAVID HOWELL:  No, I'm all right.  It was typical really.  I played quite reasonably to be honest with you.  Yeah, quite promising, nothing much happened really, got that birdie at the last. 
 You know, it's tough out there.  I never hit it really close, I hit it to 12, 15 feet a number of times and didn't make any.  Made a couple of errors in there as well.  So all in all, I don't feel like I could have scored any worse, which is promising. 
 I hit two poor 6-irons.  Those were my two real mistakes out there.  My only bad swings were on 11 and 4.  I hit them both left and didn't get them up-and-down. 
 Other than that, didn't hit any particularly poor shots. 

 Q.  Very happy with your game? 
 DAVID HOWELL:  Yeah, frustrating not to score better.  Obviously the scoring is still pretty good out there with the leaders, but no, it bodes well for the next three or four rounds, so that's good. 

 Q.  How difficult is it to putt out in the windy conditions? 
 DAVID HOWELL:  It's obviously tricky trying to work out whether it's going to turn or not with the wind, but I didn't do a very good job of that today I must admit.  If I holed a couple of more putts, it would have been what I deserved.  Tricky but the greens are perfect.  And we have all putted in wind before.
