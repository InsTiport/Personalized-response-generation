 Q. Glad to be back after missing out on defending last year?
 DAVID HOWELL: I am delighted to be back because, as you say, I missed last year and didn't get the chance to defend which was a big blow. The place looks great, the course and everything around it and the tournament looks bigger and better than ever. 

 Q. Have you been out for knock this week? 
 DAVID HOWELL: I played on Sunday and it's pretty firm which always makes Wentworth tricky. Plus we have all the bunkers that Ernie has put in over the last couple of years to contend with now so it's going to be a tough test.

 Q. I take it you are looking to get back to where you were in Portugal recently, get the good form abck and start climbing up the rankings again? 
 DAVID HOWELL: Yeah. The game's not bad - obviously I have had some disappointment in the last couple of tournaments with missed cuts etc, but I have only been missing by one shot. It's not the way I want to be but at the same time it's not a million miles away either. We all know how fickle a game this can be. Hopefully winning here in 2006 can inspire me to get up there again.
