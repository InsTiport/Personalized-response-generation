  Q. 8-under par, you must be delighted?  
 DAVID HOWELL: Yes, I am, definitely. We are always greedy works have liked a few more birdie putts to go in. Made a bit of a hash at the 16th, but overall 68 was a really good score in these conditions.   
 Yeah, it was a nice week for me.  
  
  Q. How much of a battle will it be, the final few holes for the final few groups?  
 DAVID HOWELL: Well, you can make some mistakes but once you get past 16, 17, 18, they are pretty much downwind. So the length that Quiros has got, and Thomas has a couple of shot lead, it's going to be down to those two I think. I think I'm probably safe to go to the airport, but I'm pretty happy with my week's work. So I'll let them battle it out.   
  
  Q. What's been the difference with your golf in recent months?  
 DAVID HOWELL: I think a bit more responsibility for my own game I think, and try to think less. And I've been working hard, as well. Been enjoying my golf a bit more, had a nice winter in Dubai and get a little bit fitter, so healthy. Mind is in a good place. All in all, a pretty decent package.  
  
  Q. You spend lots of time in Dubai, are you looking forward to next week? You know how to win there and you also know how to beat Tiger Woods.   
 DAVID HOWELL: Yeah, that's easy, that -- I wish. I'm looking forward to it. I missed the cut last year, and my apartment overlooks the course, so it wasn't a very nice weekend spending everyone battle it out for the Classic trophy. This will give me some confidence going into next week and obviously looking forward to another good one.
