   DAVID HOWELL:  It was great to be out there to be honest. I have been chomping at the bit to come out on tour. Even though the weather wasn't very welcoming I enjoyed myself out there. Funnily enough the one thing I didn't do too well today was putt, which is normally my strong point.  I hit a few bad putts. I drove the ball very well today but my iron shots were average at best. My putting let me down so I will try and do some work this afternoon. I misread a couple of putts, which is nothing to do with the lay-off, just poor decisions. I played with Michael Campbell and Monty and I pretty matched them all the way round. You can't be too greedy first round back in almost three months and I shot under par in pretty testing conditions, so I guess I should be pretty happy.
