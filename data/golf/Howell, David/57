Q.  David, a quiet start to the day for you, 1 over par through ten holes, I think everyone was going low, what are with you thinking at that stage?
DAVID HOWELL:  A bit frustrated, not the greatest start, bogeyed the first and nothing really happened.  But as yesterday, I reminded myself, I had a great day yesterday, stayed patient.  And you never know what's going to happen.  And sure enough, I managed to roll a cup until at the end and delighted and a very nice way to finish.
Q.  What was the key to such a strong finish and good all around play?
DAVID HOWELL:  I didn't do anything different than I had done early on, really.  You know, I played the two par 5s, 9 and 11 nicely.  Poor drive off 10.

But there's birdie chances out there and managed to hit a nice 5 iron to 17 and rolled it in to 12 feet which is no mean feat.  The greens are bumpy, they are in great condition, but with 150 guys gone through, you can certainly see a few spike marks.  That was very pleasing, and then hit a fairway driver off the last but managed to rescue myself with my wedge play.  So all in all, delighted.
