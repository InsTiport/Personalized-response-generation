Q. Tell us a bit about today.
DAVID HOWELL:   I finished 2-under and I would have been happy with 3-under -- it was a bit disappointing with a six at the last. I didn't play great -- it was typical me really, I got it round alright, a few bad shots, a few good shots.

Q. We thought you were going to go to 4- or even 5-under?
DAVID HOWELL:   I was thinking that three threes would have been a lovely way to finish, but I played three terrible shots at the last and was disappointed with the finish.

Q. There are a few exceptions, but in the main, all your premier ranked players have done OK but nothing better?
DAVID HOWELL: I had noticed that none of the major names are right up at the top of the leaderboard.

Q. Can you explain that?
DAVID HOWELL:   No. I wish I could -- I suppose none of them played well enough. I suppose it doesn't matter Thursday does it? I don't know if any of them have gone the other way and put themselves out of the tournament but I'm there on two under and will take that for the moment.

Q. The fairways are quite bouncy this week -- could that be a reason why you had some difficulty with it?
DAVID HOWELL:  Possibly. This course always plays more difficult when it's bouncy. Lots of people assume the opposite, but that's not the case. The 18th is a classic example. I hit a poor shot into the bunker but it's very tricky to get that line right off that tee because if you take too much club you will run into the traps and not enough you are in the rough on the right, so it can be pretty tricky at times.
