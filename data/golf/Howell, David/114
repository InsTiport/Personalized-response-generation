DAVID HOWELL:  I hit the ball very well but didn't have to hole any significant putts. All the birdies were from close range. My longest was from 12 feet at the 16th. All pretty good really.


This format does seem to suit my temperament. I finished third two years ago. I like to help the amateurs along and I actually find it quite relaxing. I know it's a long time out there but it's something different and there is no point in getting frustrated. I am able to switch off and try to help my amateur and take some of the pressure off my golf in between shots. I accept it as something different and you just give it your best.


Not been a bad season. France was my main chance to win. I've been up there for each of the last three weeks but not quite close enough to win. I am playing well and hopefully the chance will come. Maybe this week. I've had a few top tens so I have been better since I came back from injury and able to play more regularly. I had a broken arm last year and a shoulder injury this season but the last two months are probably the best physically I've been in years. That makes a difference. I have been doing a lot of work with my coach, Clive Tucker, and I am starting to see the results.
