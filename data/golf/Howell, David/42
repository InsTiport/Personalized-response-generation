 DAVID HOWELL: We played some all right stuff the front nine  but didn't have any putts. It was  obviously difficult at times. Really got  no momentum whatsoever. 10 was playing  fairly easy and didn't birdie that and obviously the shot stiff on 11 really  gave us a bit of impetus. 
 Our job today, our job was to stay  in touch with the leaders, being only 1-under after nine which we did really  well. 

 Q.  What did you hit at 11? 
 DAVID HOWELL: Hybrid. 

 Q.  Strange nature of this format, if you get it going in foursomes, you can  suddenly go right through. 
 LUKE DONALD: The weather tomorrow, it could be quite  tough, and a good score really can shoot you up the leaderboard. So a couple behind --
 DAVID HOWELL: The weather on this course, you really could  -- it's fairly bunched today with the weather being as it was. No one is going to shoot 59, and if you play  poorly you still shoot 2-under. 

 Q.  After playing your first practise round, you thought no 58s in this  place with the weather. 
 LUKE DONALD: It's got tougher every day. There's a couple holes out there where the  rain was just coming in sideways, 350-yard 5th.
