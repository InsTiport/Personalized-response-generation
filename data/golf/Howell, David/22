  DAVID HOWELL:   Another really good finish.   Had not had a really good finish since France and I knew one was coming and it's come this week.   End of the day, it's my second best finish in two or three years I guess.   
So, got to be delighted.   Obviously a couple of shots better would have been all the nicer.   I didn't play quite well enough to challenge to win with bow and Jason playing so well.   But pretty strong effort.  
   
 Q.   Just in terms of the season, it puts you into that Top 60 bracket hopefully, which has obviously been your goal for the last few weeks?   
DAVID HOWELL:   Well, I don't know, somewhere near I guess, round and about, and obviously it's just got me into Singapore, so delighted with that.   I've really been gunning for Dubai World Championship, and I don't want to commentate there.   I'll gladly do it if I have to, but yeah, just be the wrong side of the ropes.   Living just down the road, it's been rubbish the last few years.   Still a bit of work to do to finish the job off but it's good fun trying, as well.  
   
 Q.   Plenty of positives to take from the way you played?  
DAVID HOWELL:   Absolutely.   I played really nice again this week, and so difficult out there with the greens so firm and fast.   It's pretty nerve‑wracking knocking the short ones in, and the only one I missed really was 17, just didn't get down the hill.   
But a lovely 2‑putt at the last would have been nice if it had gone in obviously.   But funny enough my caddie said, you haven't had a real long one all week.   I thought he was talking nonsense, but as it turns out, it was half a roll from being right.   But a great finish.
