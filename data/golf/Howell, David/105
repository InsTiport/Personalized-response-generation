Q.
Obviously you played very well, very well today, and in a pretty dominant fashion.  Did you think you had it in you to do something like that to your opponent today?
DAVID HOWELL:  Absolutely not.  With about seven minutes to go before I teed off, I threw all the theory out the window and I got out and decided to just hit the ball pretty much as hard as I could and see what happens.  So I didn't play fantastic early on, hit a few poor shots, made some good saves.  It didn't appear it was going to pan out.  I just had a good run, made some birdies, chipped in.

Shigeki couldn't match me with any birdies.  It looked like it was going to be a close match, around about 73 for a long time.  And this run came from nowhere, really.
Q.  How do you look going into tomorrow?  Are you going to continue to grip and rip it tomorrow?
DAVID HOWELL:  I'm going to the range and do some work and just try and get a feel for exactly what I'm doing.  The greens and tees are fine.  I feel the fairways are wet, but on match play it doesn't make any difference if you have to take a drop.

I had a situation on one of the early par 4s where I was in pretty wet conditions on the fairway.  You've got to play a few wet lies.  But overall it was fine.
