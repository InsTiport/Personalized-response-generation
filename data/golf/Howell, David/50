Q.  David, how would you assess that round?
DAVID HOWELL:  Yeah, disappointing in the end.  Obviously I was 3 under through 10 and going nicely and just hit a couple of loose shots there and let the round get away from me a little bit.  If I could have plowed on and shot 67, 66 again today, but 71 really wasn't what I was after.
Q.  Did you look at the scoreboard and realise that Tiger probably wasn't what you were expecting, going away from the field and that you were going towards him; did that have any bearing on you at all?
DAVID HOWELL:  No, I had already dropped a shot at 12 by the time I looked.  And I actually looked on 13 and it gave me a bit of a boost to be honest with you, that I was right in the hunt.

The wind came up and the storm came up for ten minutes and I hit a bad drive on 15 and that cost me a shot on the par 5 and another loose one on 16.  I realised Tiger wasn't too far away, but I made a couple of birdies around that stretch, as well, from the looks of it, and he's stretched away from us again.
Q.  The premium is on the fairways because the rough is absolutely fierce out there.  Did that have any sort of bearing on tightening up a fraction, you know you need to hit the fairway?
DAVID HOWELL:  Yeah, 15, especially, the par 5, obviously you're thinking birdie, but you know if you don't get the drive in the fairway, it's tough to make par and that's exactly what happened to me.  I had to hit my 2 iron in for the third shot and short sided myself, and then they had a tricky pin on 16, as well, and the wind was quite breezy there.

Yeah, you had to hit the right shot at the right time and unfortunately I wasn't able to do that.
