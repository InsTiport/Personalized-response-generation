DAVID HOWELL:  I had about 220 pin, just the difficult shot I've played in my life really, slightly cut 3 iron.  When I finally start doing that, I'm going to be pretty decent at this game.  Amazing thing was, I had the ball in my hand ready to drop and I just said, "What line do you think, Lads?"

And they said:  "Well, we'll walk up and see if we can see a pitchmark."

Then we shouted across, it carried the line by that, and plugged, couldn't see the thing.  Yeah, so to make two birdies from that position was quite fantastic.  It's kept me right in the ballgame, as they say.
Q.  Same with Harrington, 69 puts him right back in.
DAVID HOWELL:  Yeah, makes it go down to the wire with a bit of luck.  I need to play a bit better than I did today, but shoulder felt good, which is great.  So might even attempt a little bit of practise    maybe not tonight.
Q.  Quite encouraging the way things are?
DAVID HOWELL:  I didn't play great, don't get me wrong.  But if I can turn around and have a great weekend, I'd be in with a shot which is more than I can ask for.
Q.  If it was 50/50 about you playing on Wednesday, what is it about being in contention to do what you need to do?  Have you virtually you dismissed that from your mind?
DAVID HOWELL:  Well, no.  Like I said if I knew I could get it around some way around par the first day, around this course, you know, third generally only takes 5  or 6 under on this course.  So I knew I would be in with a shout if I could just stay in that first day.  Obviously not easy to stay third, but I was hopeful, underpractised, you know, who knows.
