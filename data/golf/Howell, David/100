DAVID HOWELL: Last week I was gutted after losing the play-off but today I wasn't. I was really pleased with how I finished.  I drove it terribly today.  I was laughing, really.  I couldn't do anything but keep trying, and to get in the playoff    I didn't surprise myself, but I'm proud of myself for doing it the way I drove the ball.
Q.  Did you reckon you needed to play the last four in 3 under to have a shout?
DAVID HOWELL:  Well, I didn't really think about it much to be honest with you.  I knew I had to make birdie.

Certainly had the chance on the two par 5s for birdie, and then getting the eagle
Q.  How far was that?
DAVID HOWELL:  260, with a three wood, something like that.  And then my drive in the playoff, hit it right all day long and finally get a drive right in the playoff, and I missed the iron shot.
Q.  You really had to hack it hard at 18, as well, just to get it back again.
DAVID HOWELL:  Exactly.
Q.  What did you hit it in third shot there?
DAVID HOWELL:  7 iron.
Q.  7 iron from?
DAVID HOWELL:  155, 15 feet.
Q.  Would you say that one must be the best element you take out of that?
DAVID HOWELL:  Yeah, I'm much more positive about it than last week.  It's between twixt and between all week.  I've been hitting right all day long and I've had to give up on the first playoff hole with a driver, been working well with the iron shots so.
Q.  What was the second shot in?
DAVID HOWELL:  3 iron. Not a good lie.
