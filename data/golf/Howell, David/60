Q.
Talk about your round today.  You got off to a good start?
DAVID HOWELL:  I didn't play very well at all.  I struggled with my swing all week, and today was more of the same, so it was a case of damage limitation, really, even though I got off with a nice birdie start.  I'm not really swinging the club well enough to attack any pins.  I got away with the lowest number I could, which I really did.
Q.  You said with your swing not working it was probably a little bit of a grind?
DAVID HOWELL:  You know, shooting a low one tomorrow would be nice.
Q.  Did you find the course change a little bit during the day?
DAVID HOWELL:  Yeah, obviously the rough is really difficult because of the rain we have overnight, but other than that it was easier.  The fairways are playing wider, the greens are softer, so overall it's an easier test today than it has been.

It wasn't quite as sticky, either.  There was a gentle breeze which wasn't enough to make it difficult, but it was quite cooling, which was nice.  Overall you can see why the guys are playing well today.
