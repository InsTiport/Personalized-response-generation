Oakland Hills that proved pivotal, as well, in the four balls?
DAVID HOWELL:  We gel well.  We're comfortable in each other's company really, on the course, and of course Paul has more power than I've got maybe.  We gel well and we get on great, and that's what good partnership is all about.  Fortunately today we managed to play some good golf as well.
Q.  Pretty convincing.
DAVID HOWELL:  Well, Zach and Stewart played well; they didn't do an awful lot wrong.  Zach, he holed all his putts this morning, he obviously played some fantastic golf in the morning and couldn't find a putt in the afternoon.  We didn't make any mistakes in the first and they also made a bogey there, as well.  We were always in control, but it's never as easy as that when you turn to the back nine.  Things went our way all day and it turned into an easy day in the end.
Q.  Quite a margin going into tomorrow.  What are your thoughts heading into the singles?
DAVID HOWELL:  We're four points in front and we have lost in that situation before.  Our goal is to go out and win the singles, and that's certainly going to be our goal.  Hopefully we've got our players playing well to do that and they are going to come out all guns blazing and I'm sure it will be another classic Ryder Cup Sunday and it's our job to make that not happen.
