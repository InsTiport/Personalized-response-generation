Q.  You've achieved your goal; you're a Ryder Cup player.
DAVID HOWELL:  It's fantastic.  I stayed as calm as I could today and did everything right and just had one -- well, I hit two bad shots on 16.  The tee shot wasn't disastrous, and the second shot I went too far right, went in the water and wasn't trying to hit that far right and just felt all the pressure come on.  I didn't know how anyone was doing.  I just tried to focus on my own game and sort of limped over the line.
Q.  10, 11 and 12, gave you a lovely cushion.
DAVID HOWELL:  Yeah, a lot better today.  I really played my heart out and stayed patient again, and there was 5-under with three to play and those three birdies really settled me down.
Q.  Where does this rank on your list of achievements?
DAVID HOWELL:  The biggest, by far.  I want to go there, and I've always said I wanted to play on a winning Ryder Cup Team, not just play in the Ryder Cup.  That's the next big step.  Delighted to be there and get the first step of the job done.
Q.  Inaudible?
DAVID HOWELL:  I've really come on, working with Claude, I think my best finish has been third which is amazing.  Most people say you have to win to get in, but I've just kept persevering and had a lot of Top-10s, and hopefully this will give me the belief that the next win won't be far away.
