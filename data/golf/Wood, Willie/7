 Q.   Talk about your round today.   
WILLIE WOOD:   My round was very uneventful.   I hit a lot of greens and 2‑putted all day long.   I had one birdie and two bogeys.   I hit the ball pretty solidly, but it got harder as the day progressed because the wind came up.   The first five or six holes wasn't too bad, but then it got pretty hard.   
And so I'm ‑‑ I thought they set up the golf course pretty fair and hopefully tomorrow will be better.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the challenge of these greens?   
WILLIE WOOD:   They are very undulating and rarely do you have a flat putt.   Unless you could put the ball ‑‑ if you have real control of your irons you can put the ball in the right spot where you have an uphill putt, but it's quite difficult at times.   
But it's a ‑‑ there's just a lot of holes that have greens that are just have knobs and humps and bumps, and you got to think your way around the golf course.  
   
 Q.   What are you looking to work on for tomorrow?  
WILLIE WOOD:   I'm going to try to hit the ball a little more solidly and I'm going to go putt for an hour or so and hopefully they will fall tomorrow.
