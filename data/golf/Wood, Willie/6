Q.   Talk about your round today and your mentality going into tomorrow. 
WILLIE WOOD:   My round was pretty solid today.   I didn't make very many mistakes, I didn't have a bogey, I putted better today than the first two days. 
Tomorrow, just going to try to do more of the same. 

Q.   With five bogeys yesterday, but none today, did you change your mentality on certain holes?   What was the thing that clicked today?
WILLIE WOOD:   Well, I putted better.   I made those ‑‑ I just made more putts today.   I left a lot of putts short yesterday and today I got them to the hole.

Q.   And did the weather affect you at all today with the rain?
WILLIE WOOD:   Well, I was shocked when I drove up here it was raining so hard I didn't think we were going to play for a long time.   We got off almost on time and after they juggled or moved the guys to both tees, and I'm a little bit shocked, but the course was great.   It drains well.
