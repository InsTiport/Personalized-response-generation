 Q.   Talk about your round a little bit.   Five birdies?  
WILLIE WOOD:   Five birdies and I putted terrific today.   The best putting round I've had of the year.   I actually chipped in twice.   I didn't drive the ball very good.   Hopefully, if I can put the ball in the fairway this weekend, I can have a real good tournament.   
   
 Q.   What was the big difference from yesterday to today?  
WILLIE WOOD:   Oh, mainly just making those putts.   I haven't added up my total putts per round today, but it was in the low 20s, I believe.   
   
 Q.   How was the course playing today versus yesterday?  
WILLIE WOOD:   A little longer.   They set it up, they set the tees back a little further.   Because the golf course is drying out and so it's a little nicer day.   So they made it a little harder today.   But it's a good day to score because it's not cold and windy and so I'm sure there will be some really good scores out there.  
   
 Q.   What are you looking forward to tomorrow?  
WILLIE WOOD:   I'm looking forward to putting it in the fairway and making a bunch of birdies.
