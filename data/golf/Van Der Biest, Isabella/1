Q. One question I had was has this been a little bit of -- you folks got into the field last Thursday or thereabouts, so just tell us about the whirlwind of that.  When did you find out and how much did you have to scramble to get here?
SOPHIA BURNETT: I actually missed prom, my boyfriend's birthday, and state for the high school team, so.
Q. What high school team is that?
SOPHIA BURNETT: Hilton Head prep for the boys team.  So, yeah, I kind of had to scramble a lot.
Q. That was all this weekend?
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Uh-huh.
Q. Hopefully people are going to be a little understanding considering you you're now in the round of 16; you qualified.  Does that hopefully make up for that a little bit?
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah, for sure.
Q. Okay.  Cool.  Now what can you tell us about the match today?  Seemed like you got up pretty quickly?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Yeah, we started out getting up, and we kind of maintained that position the whole way through.
Q. Seems like you were 3-up a lot of the way.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: It was.  It was down to two once, and then we got it right back up on the next hole?
Q. What was the key to that?  Did you say to each other, Let's get on top early?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: No.  We were just focusing on playing the course.  My caddie told me to treat every hole as a different match, so...
Q. And his name is?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Tyler?
Q. Last name again?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Fountain.
Q. So every hole as an individual match.  Great way to separate it and concentrate, put it down to just shot by shot.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Yeah.  Not get to high, not get too low.
Q. And you won a couple of early matches then, right?
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah, we did.
Q. How did you do that?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: We par'd and they bogeyed.
SOPHIE BURNETT: Yeah, I think that was the first one.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Uh-huh.  Then I made a really long putt on the Par 5, yeah.
Q. How long was that?  Any idea?
SOPHIA BURNETT: Probably like 35, 40-ish.  It was a good long putt.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Yeah.  It was a putt you don't usually make.
Q. Excellent.  That always helps.  Feel like you got a bonus a little bit?
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah.
Q. Then you kept the pressure on as well to get to 3-up.  How did you do that?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: I think it was another par and they bogeyed again, yeah.
Q. We found that especially as we turn from stroke to match play, that pars are really good to get around here.
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yes.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: For sure.
Q. Have you felt a little more comfort with the course as you've played?
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah.  And knowing she's here.  Kind of have our backs the whole way through.  So she hits a bad shot and I hit a good shot and I hit a bad shot and she hits a good shot.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Yeah, we balance each other out.
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah.
Q. So knowing that pars are good, did you both get to play the full practice rounds before?
SOPHIA BURNETT: We played 18 one day and then 13 holes on...
Q. (Indiscernible.)
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah.
Q. So comfort level growing every day with this course?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Yeah, for sure.
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah.
Q. What's the key?  Keep it below the hole or keep it in front?
SOPHIA BURNETT: Pay attention to pin positions and smart yardages, yeah.
Q. Is there one that's more conservative or more aggressive?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: No, we're both pretty conservative.
Q. Okay, that can be a really good thing.
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah.  We don't really play very aggressive.
Q. Does anybody ever say, Hey, go for this one?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Yeah, when the right time is.
Q. So maybe you've gotten a little farther than you thought and now you're into Tuesday, round of 16.
SOPHIA BURNETT: Yeah.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Yeah.
Q. This is bonus time or what do you feel like?
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: I think same philosophy:  just playing our own game and treating every hole as a different match.
Q. Any particular parts of your game that you feel like has really shown has gotten you to this point?
SOPHIA BURNETT: I think my putting, yeah.  And both our puttings.  We just made some putts.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Yeah, I think putting is key, especially match play.
Q. Can come down to that quite a bit, right?  Well congratulations.
SOPHIA BURNETT: Thank you.
ISABELLA VAN DER BIEST: Thank you.
