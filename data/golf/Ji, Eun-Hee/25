  Q. So if you're like me, absolutely sweating. How are you feeling?  
 EUN-HEE JI: Really hot today. I didn't play well, so I'm trying hard but really hot out there.   
  
  Q. What was the course like? Was it as hard as everyone was expecting?  
 EUN-HEE JI: Yes, really hard. Like weather is really hot, so making more hard green and hard fairway.   
 So we have to really perfect shot, but sometimes really good shot, but, like, bounce different way, like really hard out there.  
  
  Q. What do you do, now that you're done, to regroup for tomorrow to get yourself cooled down both physically and mentally?  
 EUN-HEE JI: I play tomorrow afternoon, but tomorrow was -- I thought about it rain tomorrow.  
  
  Q. It's supposed to maybe a little, yeah. Bring the cool weather?  
 EUN-HEE JI: Yes, really cool, and I think make more easier for the course, because rain make more softer fairway and softer greens, so I think make more easier for us, yeah.
