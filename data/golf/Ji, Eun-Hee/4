 Q.  So what is it like to be back in Taiwan and thinking about your wane last year?  
EUN-HEE JI: Actually, it's a really, really good memory for in Taiwan for me.  I always when I come here, I play well, and actually, I have won last year, so I have a really good memory.  So it's really good to be back here, so it's great.   
 Q.  What do you remember most from last year?  
EUN-HEE JI: Actually, I felt really good with my swing because I couldn't hit it well for, you know, eight years, and finally I hit it very well, and I made a win.  So I just remember that.   
 Q.  What do you think was the difference?  Why did you start hitting so well?  
EUN-HEE JI: I changed my swing from like two years ago, and that helps a lot.  Actually, I'm hitting pretty much a different length than before, so maybe that makes me a lot different.   
 Q.  You won by six shots last year.  Is that the biggest win you've ever had?  
EUN-HEE JI: I think so.   
 Q.  At any level, like not just LPGA?  
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, any level.   
 Q.  How did it feel to just be so far ahead of everyone else?  
EUN-HEE JI: Actually, like day before, last two days, was a little bit nervous because I was pretty far from the second place, but you know, if I lose, kind of makes me more bad than one, two strokes.  Was a little bit nervous.   
 Q.  How do you feel like you've been playing this year?  
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, I made win, beginning of this year, I think because of this tournament because I get more confidence from this tournament.  It's not quite where I want to be, so I keep trying to be working hard.   
 Q.  Do you have any goals for the rest of the season?  
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, my goal is another win, and keep the spot for this tournament again.  That's my goal.
