 Q.  So we're here with our Swinging Skirts LPGA Taiwan Champion, Eun-Hee Ji.  That must be a wonderful sound to hear, "Champion."  How do you feel right now?  
EUN-HEE JI: I'm so happy and excited because I haven't won for the past eight years.  So I was waiting for this moment for so long, so I'm super happy right now.   
 Q.  Super happy, and a super day today, bogey-free 65.  Did it help that the weather was bright and sunny, or what propelled you this week to such a good week?  
EUN-HEE JI: It is a nice day for playing golf today, and I have a really good group with Lydia and Jenny, so I was more relaxed with them and enjoyed playing with them.  Yeah, it's been great.   
 Q.  It's been about eight and a half years since that last win at the 2009 U.S. Women's Open.  Were you ever concerned about, would it happen again, or did you know it was in you?  
EUN-HEE JI: I mean, I'm trying all the time, and I tried to make another win, quite a long time to make another win.  But I was trying pretty hard.
