 Q.  So Eun-Hee Ji, you had six birdies today, no bogeys.  I'm not the first person to ask this:  What golf course were you playing today?  
EUN-HEE JI: Same golf course as everyone.  I just played great.  I don't feel like any nervous, nothing.  So I just focus on my game.   
 Q.  That's pretty incredible considering these conditions.  How were you able to separate the conditions from you playing out there, because they often so well go together.  
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, I just tried to work on my swing, other than playing with wind or with the weather.   
I didn't play well last week, so I practiced a lot and I changed my swings a little bit.  That one I worked on a lot.  My caddie is helping me a lot.  It's like more information for wind and club choosing.  That's everything.   
 Q.  Any particular moment out there on the golf course that stood out to you as your best moment, or was it all just a good day?  
EUN-HEE JI: I think just a good day.  Just nothing changed.  I'm just more relaxed with the weather.  That makes it a lot easier for when I play.   
 Q.  Now you go into tomorrow, maybe expecting more rain.  Do you feel about where you stand on this great first day going into the rest of the week?  
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, I just try today and do my best every round.
