Q. Birdie a great way to end a round and even better when it gets you into a tie for the lead.  How do you feel coming off the golf course?
EUN-HEE JI: It's not feel bad, because I'm still leading.  Not as great as yesterday but I don't feel really bad, you know.  I just struggled with my putting this first nine, and I get just a little bit better on the back nine.  I just made it out a little bit, and, yeah, I think I'm pretty happy to make a birdie on the last.
Q. The weather changed a lot today.  It was windy and then it was sunny and then it was wet.  Did that affect you at all?
EUN-HEE JI: I think it was more windier than yesterday.  So I feel like, you know, I think more wind, and couldn't get relaxed like yesterday.  So I'm trying to get relaxed more and don't try to hit it harder.
Q. So you're tied at the top of the leaderboard with Jenny Shin.  What's your game plan going into the weekend?
EUN-HEE JI: I'm not trying to make a birdie out there.  I'm trying to make a safe play, and don't try to -- I mean, I'm not trying to make, you know, like losing or struggle or whatever it is.  Just trying to make a safe play.
