  Q. 2-under par, nice round. Can you give me your overall thoughts about how you played?  
 EUN-HEE JI: I play really well today. I felt really good in my putting, so I can make really good save on like couple holes.  
 So pretty good.  
  
  Q. A lot of other players have been saying that because of the mountains, because of anything, that reading the greens are very difficult. Do you find that the case, or are you dealing with it well?  
 EUN-HEE JI: I just look at my yardage book and I listen to my caddie, so we just figured out which way we going.  
  
  Q. Has it been tough to get into a rhythm because of all the stoppages and starts and the breaks in play?  
 EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, I just played two holes yesterday, and I played today 18 holes. Then maybe we can play after finish with everybody. I hope. I hope really good weather today.   
 But it's really tired for player, so we have to make really good condition for all day.   
  
  Q. What part of your game do you think is the best right now? 2-under is a very good score. What led you to 2-under?  
 EUN-HEE JI: Um, I'm just trying to like keep in the fairway and then keep in the greens.   
 I just feel really good today. Yeah.  
  
  Q. How do you feel going into the next two rounds? You're only a few strokes back. What's your plan?  
 EUN-HEE JI: If I feel really like today, I can play, I hope, really good play next two rounds.
