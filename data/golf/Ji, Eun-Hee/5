Q. It's four days since your amazing, emotional victory last weekend.  How are you feeling now?
EUN-HEE JI: Great.  Actually I haven't won the past eight years and I just won.  It's just so exciting.  Still exciting couple days.
Q. When it comes to the golf, coming out here, was it really easy to find form?
EUN-HEE JI: You know, I played here quite a long time, a couple times in eight years.  I know this golf course.  I know what I need to do.  So just little more comfortable.
Q. And tell us, what do you need to do if you're going to continue your winning streak this week?
EUN-HEE JI: I fix my swing last week.  I'm just trying to get more comfortable with my swing.  So just do what I did last week, what I fixed on my backswing, and just focus on my game.
Q. Nice 5-under 66 today.  You said you've played here every tournament but you're also coming off a great big win.  What helped propel you to that great round today?
EUN-HEE JI: Especially my putting was really well today.  And actually, my shot was really great.
Front nine, I hit it close to the pin and just make easy birdie.  Back nine, I was just a little bit more control with my ball-striking, but it was great.
Q. We're just a few days removed from your big victory, eight years since your win.  Are you still maybe running on a little adrenaline from that this week?
EUN-HEE JI: The players still talk to me a lot.  I'm still excited.
Q. It's very hot out here.  My last question for you before you go inside to the air conditioning:  How do you deal with the heat and humidity out here during a round of golf?
EUN-HEE JI: I'm trying to keep outside of the sun.  So I'm trying to keep my umbrella on and drink a lot of water and take some amino stuff.
