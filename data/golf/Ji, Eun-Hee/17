Q. So 7-under today.  Up to 18 for the tournament.  What's been working for you so well this week?
EUN-HEE JI: Actually, my putting was really good.  Actually, my iron shot was really good, too because I was really struggling with my irons the last couple of weeks but it's getting better this week.
Q. Is there something that you worked on, any changes you've made that's kind of led to this improvement?
EUN-HEE JI: Actually, with my back swing, trying to a little bit shorter my back swing.  So that's pretty good for me.
Q. And 18-under is obviously a pretty low score.  Do you have any score in mind for tomorrow and what it would take to win this thing?
EUN-HEE JI: No.  I didn't think about that score.  I just try my best on every shot and just trying to focus on my game.
Q. You're a two-time winner out here, but not since the Open in '08.  What would it mean for you to break through another one?
EUN-HEE JI: Actually, I changed a lot of swing after the Open.  But it's almost what I was to be, so it gets closer, I think, right now.
Q. What will it take to come out with a victory tomorrow on this course?
EUN-HEE JI: Putting, I think.  Yeah.  The putting is always important.
Q. Thank you so much.  Good playing out there.
