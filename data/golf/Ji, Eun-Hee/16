 Q.  Very well done, two days in a row you're visiting us, that means you're playing well?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah.  Actually, I hit a lot of wedges today, but I hit a lot of hybrid and long irons today.  But greens a lot softer, so I can go for the green.  So that makes a little bit more chance to make birdie today.   
 Q.  What was the best part of your game today?  Did you put yourself in position with your driver?  
EUN HEE JI: My driver wasn't that good today, but my iron was really good, so I can make the green a lot.  So I had a lot of birdie today, but I made a lot of bogeys, too.   
 Q.  Are you starting to get the feeling that you got when you were in Saucon Valley in 2009?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, kind of.  Yeah.   
 Q.  Does that come as you play?  Do you feel things are right or explain that a little bit?  
EUN HEE JI: It's a long time ago, but I trying to remember everything.  So, yeah, trying to be more positive and what feels like, yeah.   
 Q.  Do you think, given the fact that you're now safely in the mix for the weekend and you're in a good position on the scoreboard, do you think you're going to have to do a lot more under par?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, I think so, because there is a lot of good players.  And if greens softer or less wind, you will have a lot of under pars coming up.   
 Q.  Did you feel like this morning was easier than yesterday?  
EUN HEE JI: I think so, a little more softer, yeah.  I can control the ball a lot more.   
 Q.  Was the wind different again?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, it's swirling every hole.
