Q. Well played today.
EUN HEE JI: Thank you.
Q. What was working best for you?
EUN HEE JI: Actually it's a little different today.  When I practice round, I hit it longer iron, longer hybrid.  But today I hit a wedge a lot.  So that's probably help a lot.  A lot of difference.  So I have to think about a lot of shots, every shot.
Q. Did you hit it close or did you make some long putts?
EUN HEE JI: Actually I hit it close, a couple of putts for birdie.  But I made one long putt.
Q. You have one of the best scores in the afternoon.  Much different conditions than this morning.  I guess you're hoping you get those good conditions in the morning?
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, it's going to be a lot different tomorrow morning.  I have to think about on each shot, especially with second shot, I think, because I have to kind of different angle, yeah.
Q. Having had a nice history with this event, does it give you a little more comfort?
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, I won 2009, and I'm trying to think about like good memories.  And I hope to do that again.
