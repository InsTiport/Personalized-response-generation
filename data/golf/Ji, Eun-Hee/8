 Q.  It is terrific to have the Swinging Skirts LPGA Championship in Taiwan for the first time, and we are delighted to have our prize presentation with Johnson Wang, the Chairman of Swinging Skirts Golf Foundation, and our Champion in 2017, Eun-Hee Ji.  This is your first win in 203 starts.  Are you surprised yourself?  
EUN-HEE JI: Oh, yes, very much.  I mean, it's like I haven't had a win in eight years, so I was waiting for this moment for so long.   
 Q.  You've been incredibly patient.  I have to ask, how difficult was it to sleep last night on a six-shot lead?  
EUN-HEE JI: I couldn't sleep at all.  I might sleep about five hours, four hours.  I wake up at two o'clock and four o'clock, every hour.   
 Q.  I think you were even doing some putting last night at two o'clock on your hotel carpet.  
EUN-HEE JI: Yes, I did practice my putting stroke.   
 Q.  This means a lot to you.  Given how the depth of competition on the LPGA is, this week, you beat 17 out of the Top-25 on the Rolex Rankings.  You must be so proud of your achievement.  
EUN-HEE JI: Yes, I am.  I was really lower this season, and just keep working, and I try to go win and I just did it.   
 Q.  You certainly did that, and to fend off the very best, So Yeon Ryu made a late charge, and Lydia Ko you played with rallied with four birdies midway around.  Did you think what the chasing pack were doing?  I know your lead was significant.  
EUN-HEE JI: I mean, always know they are going to be chasing me up because they are really good players back there.  I wasn't worried about it because first hole when Lydia made birdie, we had a lot of holes left, and I stayed patient and just keep playing my game.   
 Q.  It can be a tough game, golf, but days like this make it all worthwhile.  When did you realize you could relax on the golf course and enjoy the moment?  
EUN-HEE JI: Actually I wasn't really relaxed on the front nine but going to the 18th hole I was more nervous because I couldn't get a win for such a long time.  I was really nervous on the last hole.
