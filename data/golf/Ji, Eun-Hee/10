CHRISTINA LANCE: Welcome, everyone.  We're here with Eun-Hee Ji, who shot 6-under today, six birdies, no bogeys.
You had an absolutely wonderful round despite the weather.  Tell me how proud you feel coming off the golf course.
EUN-HEE JI: I didn't play well last week, so I work a lot on my swing.  I was pretty -- like last week, when I swing, I was a little bit of nervous I feel.  So I kind of like -- I couldn't hit the ball last week.
So I work on with my caddie what was wrong and I fixed it a little bit.  Today just going on.
CHRISTINA LANCE: You said you made some changes to your swing.  Can you tell us what changes you made?  Clearly they worked for you today.
EUN-HEE JI: It was on my backswing, too far inside.  I hit draw all the time but actually I hit a fade all the time.  That's why I couldn't play last week.
So my caddie said I have to come in more straight up.
CHRISTINA LANCE: Two years ago, you led after the first round, led after the second round and ultimately finished second.  What about this golf course seems to suit you so well?
EUN-HEE JI: I mean, I'm not really comfortable with this golf course.  But I'm trying to be more patient and I'm trying to be not too fight with the wind because always wind here.  Just focus on my game.
Q. You come here every year, this is the seventh edition of the championship, and you are here every year.  What is so special about this tournament that makes you want to come every year?
EUN-HEE JI: I like Taiwan, and always when I come here, I play great.  That's why I come always.  I like all the people here.  I like the food here, dumplings (smiling).
CHRISTINA LANCE: Thank you so much.  Great round today.
