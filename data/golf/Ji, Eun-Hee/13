 Q.  What was the most critical point of the day for you today?  
EUN HEE JI: I think my putting was a little bit differently than yesterday.  One hole I hit it too hard, so I kind of scared a little bit after that.  So my putter is keep shorter every hole.  That's why I think I didn't make a lot of putts.   
 Q.  How were the conditions out there compared to the rest of the championship, were they more difficult?  
EUN HEE JI: Oh, yeah, a lot difficult.  Every day they make challenge every hole.  So, yeah, it is difficult.   
 Q.  When Lydia was having her struggles, did you see that as an opening for you?  
EUN HEE JI: I didn't think about it, I just play on my game and I focus on my game.  And I wasn't thinking about the other players, yeah.   
 Q.  I just heard this, but did you all look for Lydia's ball in the hazard on the 9th hole?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, I did.   
 Q.  You guys are competitors, but it seems like you have a rapport with each other?  
EUN HEE JI: I trying to looking for find her ball, but we couldn't find the ball because the rough was so thick.  So, yeah, we couldn't find it.
