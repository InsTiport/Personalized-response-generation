 Q.  Your back nine, which was the front nine, can you tell us how you managed to conjure up four consecutive birdies?  
EUN-HEE JI: My putting wasn't really feeling good, so I just be patient with the winds and I just was calm with my putting.  I just look at the line and just go hit it.   
 Q.  Clearly not that technical but playing well within the wind.  And your ability to keep the ball low in these windy conditions, just having a chat with your caddie, something you're able to do extremely well?  
EUN-HEE JI: Actually, I didn't fight with the wind.  I just using the wind a lot.  My ball flight wasn't too lower today.  I just see my ball line and I just look at my shot, my image was really good.   
 Q.  Great visualization out there.  You've been starting to play very well.  You were tied for eighth at the Evian Championship, so finding form in the latter half of this season?  
EUN-HEE JI: Yeah, it's getting better from the beginning of the season to the last of the season.  I just working on my short game last week and the week before, because my chipping wasn't feeling good.  So I was working a lot this week and I just chipped in twice today and I think I worked on a lot of right things.
