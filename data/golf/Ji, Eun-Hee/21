 Q.  Great round, good start.  
EUN HEE JI: Yes.   
 Q.  How critical were those three birdies to get started?  
EUN HEE JI: Actually, I didn't swing well today.   
 Q.  All day?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, pretty much, but I made a lot of putts because my putting was feeling really good, so that makes a lot of change I think.   
 Q.  Have you been working on putting specifically recently, any changes?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes, I didn't putt well like a couple weeks ago.  I worked on it a lot.  I practiced a lot and I'm talking with my coach and my caddies about what I needed to do.  So I think that works.   
 Q.  Who is your coach, just a putting coach?  
EUN HEE JI: Ian Triggs, he's my coach for swings and putting.   
 Q.  On the phone?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes.   
 Q.  What happened in Alabama with the WD?  Were you hurt?  
EUN HEE JI: I was hurt in my back so I had to pull out, yeah.   
 Q.  So did you just rest a lot?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah.   
 Q.  So no swinging, just putting?  
EUN HEE JI: And I played in Korea last week.  I played pretty well.   
 Q.  Were you home in Korea at all?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes.   
 Q.  How was that?  That had to be nice and relaxing or busy?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, I was really relaxed being home.   
 Q.  Perfect, what was the last time you were home in Korea?  
EUN HEE JI: Last year.   
 Q.  Oh, my gosh, was it with your parents?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, it was it was with my parents.   
 Q.  Did they cook a lot for you?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, my mom cooked a lot every day.   
 Q.  Perfect.  This event, there are not as many low scores today as there were last year in the first round.  Is it playing harder, do you think?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes, it is harder than before a major, so I have to really keep it on the fairway and really have to keep it on the greens and have to make birdie on the pars.   
 Q.  Everyone says the greens here are tricky?  
EUN HEE JI: Really tricky, yes.   
 Q.  So the putting helps?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes.   
 Q.  Was there anything specifically you've changed during your practice, alignment?  
EUN HEE JI: Not really, I just did my posture a little bit higher, that's all.  I think that's it.   
 Q.  Now a good first round in a major, you have to feel good kind of being in the mix.  How does it feel going into the mix for the next three rounds?  
EUN HEE JI: I feel more comfortable being with my position, and it feels more positive.   
 Q.  Is that something you've been working on, just positive attitude?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes, (laughing).   
 Q.  Well, you're a major champ.  Do you ever go back on that and say I've won this before?  It's been a while, but have you ever played on that before in the back of your head?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah, pretty much.  Because I'm playing pretty well when I had won, so I'm trying to be more positive and confident.   
 Q.  So a good round like that helps?  
EUN HEE JI: Yeah.
