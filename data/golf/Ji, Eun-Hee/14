 Q.  You moved on moving day.  Good job.  
EUN HEE JI: Thank you.   
 Q.  What was the best part of the game today?  
EUN HEE JI: Actually my putter pretty well today.  But I made a lot of fairways and greens, so that makes a lot of easier.   
 Q.  When you made your birdies, did you hit it close?  
EUN HEE JI: Yes, it was pretty close.  I have like -- yeah, inside ten feet, yeah.   
 Q.  Now, where you stand on the leaderboard, very impressive.  Talk about that, please.  
EUN HEE JI: You know, I'm not trying to see the leaderboard.  I'm trying to focus on my game and trying to be patient more.   
And tomorrow like same thing as today, trying to hit the fairway more and green, middle of the green, and trying to make a putt a lot.   
 Q.  Now that you're in the position you're in, how much do you go back to 2009, when you actually won, to help you do what you need to do tomorrow?  
EUN HEE JI: It's nothing different, I think.  Still a little bit of pressure from the leaderboard on the top.  So I just focus on my game.
