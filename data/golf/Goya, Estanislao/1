  ESTANISLAO GOYA:   I think the key was putting, putting really well.

Q.   I was going to ask about mentality, because after you come from Merion and how hard work there is, here there must be a release and you open your shoulders a bit more?
ESTANISLAO GOYA:   To be honest at Merion I was playing really good but I had to play 26 holes on Friday, and to be honest I was tired, and when you start to miss there, it's really, really tough to recover.   So that is what happened on the second day. 
But I had a really good experience and I think it's a lot of positive things, and a lot of things that I started using on this week.

Q.   When you say positive things, do you feel that you will benefit from that experience?
ESTANISLAO GOYA:   Yeah, of course.   I was in the top at one point in the U.S. Open, which is for me, my first U.S. Open, it was a great thing, and that means that it can be possible, you know. 

Q.   Essentially, we haven't seen you on The European Tour right up there for a little while so presumably that experience helps kickâ€‘start things, confidence?
ESTANISLAO GOYA:   Yeah, I'm working very hard.   I think it will pay off sooner or later, so I just keep on working hard and I think it's going to come.
