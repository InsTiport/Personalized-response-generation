   NELSON SILVERIO: Thanks for spending a few minutes with us here in the Media Center. Currently in the lead.
 ESTANISLAO GOYA: (In Spanish). 

 Q. However you feel more comfortable. If you could do it in English, it would be better.
 ESTANISLAO GOYA: Well, it was a tough day today because it was very windy, especially during the last six holes, it was difficult for me. 
 It was really windy and raining a lot, but I feel really confident in my putting today. I putt really good, driver better. Yesterday I didn't drive very good, but today I drive very good, so, well, I finish a really good round. 
 The last three holes were tough, and I couldn't make par the three of them. So well, I am looking forward in the weekend to play as well as I am playing now. And if I can play to win the tournament. 
 NELSON SILVERIO: Very well done. Any questions? 
(Question and answer in Spanish)
 NELSON SILVERIO: You said you found a new club on the range this morning? Is that what you said? 
 ESTANISLAO GOYA: No, no, no. I said I get a feeling. And I gotta keep that and use that. 

 Q. So this is your first PGA event. Did you come into it with any nervousness or --

 ESTANISLAO GOYA: I know when I get invited to this tournament, this is my first tournament with the PGA, so I'm really focused in European because I got my TOUR card last year, so I make it like just, you know, just know how the PGA is, and I tried to get serious. 
 But of course, if I can play good and win the tournament, it will be great because I can get my PGA TOUR card. 
 But you know, I try to enjoy my rounds. I enjoy being here because this is a great place to be. It's really nice weather. Well, today was so-so (laughs), but it's perfect. The hotel is great, and we are having a really good time. So I'm trying to enjoy it, you know, and have fun.

 NELSON SILVERIO: What age did you start playing golf?
