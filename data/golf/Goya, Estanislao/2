 Q.   A few comments about your round today?   2‑under so far?  
ESTANISLAO GOYA:   1‑under.   
   
 Q.   1‑under?  
ESTANISLAO GOYA:   Yeah, yeah, playing good.   Long day.   Hopefully just can keep up the good game for tomorrow.   But, yeah, just solid, solid from tee to green.   So I hope I can keep it up tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Premium on hitting the fairways?  
ESTANISLAO GOYA:   Yeah, I think that it's a very important thing here.   The rough is playing very long and especially now wet, it's even thicker.   So it's very, very important to be in the fairway.   
   
 Q.   How about the speed of the greens?   Did it change after the delay?  
ESTANISLAO GOYA:   I think so, yeah.   Especially having an uphill putt, it really felt it on that hole.   But tomorrow, fresh greens in the morning, it should be relatively better.   So it should be good.
