Q.
Talk about your impressions about your week here with the John Deere Classic and what makes this tournament special as you move around?
JOHN RIEGGER:  I am originally from Illinois.  Any time that I can play in my home state, it is a plus.  I get a lot of family and friends coming out to watch.  I have got a lot of friends here in this area.

I love the golf course here.  If they just kind of would knock down some of these hills a little bit.  I am getting too old to be walking around in this heat.  It is a great golf course.  It is a great venue.  I used to play it when it was over at Oakwood.  It is a great atmosphere.
