  Q.  Seve, your morning didn't start so well with Thomas Bj√∂rn pulling out but I suspect you are delighted at the way it finished?   
 SEVE BALLESTEROS: Obviously I am very happy with the result. In the last match, when you are two down with two to play, you don't expect to get anything but it was good to get a half point from it. I wasn't optimistic but Markus and Mikko played fantastic and to birdie this difficult finishing hole was great.   
  
  Q.  Nick, any consolation that you came up against some inspired golf? Your boys played well.   
 NICK FALDO: That's the bottom line. They did play well but we only won seven holes out of four matches so I guess we need to win more holes somehow.   
  
  Q. The golf has been incredible, Seve?    
 SEVE BALLESTEROS: There have been some incredible matches and incredible golf out here. I am telling the Irish people they are missing a great show here at the Heritage. Believe me!   
  
  Q.  Encouraging signs for The Ryder Cup?   
 NICK FALDO: Fortunately I can look at the positives. I don't mind that out of those 20 guys, a good fair few are going to be serious contenders for that Ryder Cup team next year.   
  
  Q.  Give us your thoughts on the afternoon pairings, Seve.   
 SEVE BALLESTEROS: I told Mikko that he could take a rest and Thomas is sick and cannot play, so I've moved Markus to Miguel Angel which I think will be a good pairing.   
  
  Q.  And you, Nick?   
 NICK FALDO: Casey's struggling so that's one choice and Marc is working on his swing. The other guys are very happy together. I'm trying to do some mucking around a little bit this afternoon but everybody's good and hopefully Rosey and Nick D will lead off and do something.
