 NICK FALDO:   Scoring is good. I arrived this morning to see Steady Eddie and Paul in, that's what got me going.  After 10, you've just got to forget about what you're doing; just keep going for the score.  Kept pushing myself along, so I'm pleased with that. 

Q.  Good scoring today. 
NICK FALDO:   Yeah, everything was just  -- compared to what we had yesterday.  I played all right.  Just got to weasel a few more putts in.  That would make a big difference. 

Q.  Do you feel like 25 PGA Championships  --
NICK FALDO:   Oh, gosh, sometimes.  Some days.  No; feeling all right.  Feeling good and trying to charge along.
I had great  -- I hit a really good pitch and it just  -- had never been by there before in 25 years.  That was a shame.  I played the shot as well as I can do, but I'm in 9-under, and I could be three back or I could be five back.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens. 

Q.  Are you inspired by this course?
NICK FALDO:   Yeah, I love to play.  It's got a great rhythm to it.  You've just got to get out there and get on the flow. 

Q.  Are you in the mood to win? 
NICK FALDO:   I feel good.  I'm going to give it a blast and see what happens. 

Q.  Do you think conditions are going to change that much? 
NICK FALDO:   As I said, three or five back.  Depends what Immelman does, he's gaining a lot of experience.  He's a young guy looking for his big win.  We shall see. 

Q.  And Paul Casey as well? 
NICK FALDO:   Yeah, he just won a couple weeks ago.  He's good on these fescue greens, obviously. 

Q.  Do you see that kind of ambition in his eye that was in your eyes once? 
NICK FALDO:   Of course, yeah.  These young guys, they are making their mark; aren't they. 

Q.  Do they ever see you  --
NICK FALDO:   No, I think they are still scared of me.
