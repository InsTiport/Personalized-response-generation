NICK FALDO:  I was flagging on the back nine in that heat and humidity. It could have been better and it could have been worse. It hit me. I was getting tired out there. I still hit good shots and the thoughts are still good and I left a couple of putts short right in the jaws. The greens are a little different in the afternoon. The grain seems to stand up a bit more. The down grain putts I left short because they look like silver but it's alright. Good to consolidate. I was going great but I was huffing and puffing, trying to get as much food as possible in me.
It's a nice position. It's good. Nice to get the feet up and recharge and come out ready for tomorrow. I've got to be more aggressive with these putts. I just couldn't push myself to get past the hole.
It's very humid out there and especially playing under the cosh. We are drenched through, so it's all right.
