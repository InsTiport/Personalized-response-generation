Q.  When you came in, you got the round of applause from the gallery out here, they believe that you can still challenge this weekend and you do, too.
NICK FALDO:  Yeah, I do, to be honest.  I'm enjoying it, it's great to be here and great to play in this atmosphere.
Q.  You haven't played it that many times in this kind of temperature.
NICK FALDO:  No, it's steaming.  I was struggling on the back nine and that was the problem.
Q.  Birdie at the last puts you in a good position for the weekend.
NICK FALDO:  Yeah, I'm lurking.  Just go and play and we'll see what happens.
Q.  Whatever you might be giving away in terms of length and stamina, where do you believe you are capable of competing?
NICK FALDO:  You can make it all happen.  It's tricky.  It looks like it's going to be dry again and there's tight pins on the greens, it's very difficult.  Just get it on the green, that's the goal.  You can't second guess yourself.
Q.  Ernie was in a short time ago and he was saying these greens need some water.  How do you feel?
NICK FALDO:  Yeah, 17 was really rough, singeing a little bit.
