Q.  Couple of drop shots? 
 
NICK FALDO:   Nothing, not very consistent in the middle.  Just sort of struggled in the middle for a while and then had a couple of chances coming in, which I didn't make, so it wasn't  -- nothing great.  When they are shooting 9-under, doesn't feel very good. 
 
Q.  How good is that round of 9-under? 
 
NICK FALDO:   The guy (Cabrera) is a long hitter.  He's probably  -- you know, it's par 68 for him, anyway.  He's playing nicely.  He played well at Augusta.  
 
Q.  Won in Argentina. 
 
NICK FALDO:  Making the course look easy with his length.  
 
Q.  How is your own game as well?  Obviously nice to be playing at Wentworth? 
 
NICK FALDO:   Rusty.  I've had a month off, so a bit of a shock to the system to come back playing competitive. 
 
Q.  Does this course sort of inspire you at all? 
 
NICK FALDO:   I've been here a million times.  So, yeah, I've always enjoyed playing here. 
 
Q.  Nice to be reunited to be reunited with Fanny, as well?
 
NICK FALDO:   Very, good.  We're really enjoying that.  That's really good for us.
