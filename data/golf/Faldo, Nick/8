Q. How would you describe what was going on out there today?SIR NICK FALDO: There's not a word.  You can't fall out of a TV tower and come and play here and hope.  Silly boy.Q. Did you have fun under the circumstances?SIR NICK FALDO: No.  No.  No, it's no fun when you look at some of those holes we had to play finishing.  Left to right into you, and if you hit a good tee shot you end up behind a mound.  I hit a couple good shots to finish.  Pars at 15 and 16 were pretty impressive.Q. Did you have any idea before the day began it was going to be as tough as you found it?SIR NICK FALDO: Did I have any idea?  You know, we got the rough end of the day because you know what this morning was like:  Flat calm.  Yeah, I blame it on the conditions (laughter.)Q. What specifically happened on 14?SIR NICK FALDO: I lost my ball.  I hit it left and lost the ball, had to go back and start again.  After that I played it pretty well.  I made a 6 after that.  That's not bad down that hole.  It's not easy.Q. What are your thoughts ahead of tomorrow?SIR NICK FALDO: Luckily I've got a bottle of Glenmorangie at home, so I'll be all right for tomorrow.  I'll be refueled for tomorrow.Q. The weather was tough today and it's due to get any tougher tomorrow --SIR NICK FALDO: Oh, you're kidding.Q. I'm sorry.SIR NICK FALDO: Beautiful.  That's fine.  I feel like I've let the leaders get away from me now, so I don't think I have to worry about anything rather than staying dry tomorrow.Q. (Inaudible.)SIR NICK FALDO: Yeah, properly.Q. (Inaudible.)SIR NICK FALDO: When it starts going badly, you can't -- I'm not a golfer anymore.  You come here to try to do your best, but these guys play every day of the week and it's a tough golf course.  I'm not even a part-time golfer.Q. Are you saying you can't enjoy your final time around here?SIR NICK FALDO: I will.  Of course I will.  I'm here with my boy, and my family is here and my friends.  Bottom line is I still did it 25 years ago.  You know, I'm still very grateful for that.Q. Is it going to be your final round tomorrow?SIR NICK FALDO: I'll let you know.  When I walk to the Swilcan Bridge I'll let you know.Q. Under better circumstances will you play next year?SIR NICK FALDO: No, these circumstances are fantastic.  This is St. Andrews.  This is where I won 25 years ago.  I'm very happy.
