Q.  (Inaudible.)

NICK FALDO:  It's interesting.  Yeah, it makes it interesting.  Yeah, you just got to hit --  it sprung up occasionally.  I had, you know, had one scary shot on 17 this week. But the weather has been great.  Today was great.  We had a, how do you describe our match?  The start was very nervy or disappointing.  We both were missing way too many putts to make it a little bit demoralizing.  And then it got a little bit better. We played under pressure and it's never encouraging.  I got to work on a few bits of my game.  If you can't hole those putts under pressure, it's a tough game.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NICK FALDO:  No, that was the goal.  We were very competitive.  I think that we were all a bit relaxed and then when we came out with a good lead after the third day, the golf got serious.  The chit chat slowed down a little bit.  And guys have got a lot of pride.  They want to play hard and win a point.  And playing for a team is always, if it was deemed a fun event, it's still a bit of pressure.  You want to be the man who gets the point and you don't want to be the man who let's the side down.  So guys are competitive that way this week.

Q.  (Inaudible.)

NICK FALDO:  Well this is perfect.  I mean it's a very challenging course.  It's not too bad off the tee.  It gets tough around the greens, on the greens.  Which is what the pros like.  It really keeps your attention of where you're trying to hit your shot to the green.  You can't just blast away and go long or that.  You can't hit it in the wrong place here, because you got some wicked slopes.  And I think, as we found, as they get slippery, the greens, you don't want to go any anywhere near those slopes because you leave yourself hard breaking putts, which is very tough to read.
