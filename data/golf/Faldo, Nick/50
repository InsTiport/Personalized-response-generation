NICK FALDO:  The PGA was the first 72 hole event that I won so it has been a big part of my career. I won four of them and finally won one round here which was great. I still feel it is our biggest event and with BMW's involvement now they really will elevate it even further, make sure it is THE event on The European Tour.
Q.  You also mentioned you went to the Monaco Grand Prix as a guest of BMW last week?
NICK FALDO:  Absolutely. I am ambassador to their World Championships so kind of part of the group and I was invited down. Their corporate hospitality was pretty slick so if they have the same vision to bring to golf and this tournament, then the guys are going to be in for a treat. They will take this to a new level, a new standard which has to be great for the Tour. If they do that then hopefully other sponsors will follow suit.
Q.  How is your own game?
NICK FALDO:  Rusty. I am in and out of playing and business and it is tough. I am feeling it. The body is feeling it. It is hard work on the body right now. But I am here to do my absolute best this week. This is one which gets my interest and I will make a big effort in the short time we have got before the tournament starts on Thursday.
Q.  Has the course changed much in the years you have been coming here?
NICK FALDO:  I don't think it has. They have thrown in a few bunkers here and there but the basic shots are pretty much the same. Nothing much has changed around the greens and I think it is very similar. That is why we enjoy it. It is the same rhythm around the golf course, same strategy. We shall see. This weather will help. If it plays easy the guys will eat it up. It is a great golf course.
