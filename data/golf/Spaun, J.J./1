 Q.  Just comment on the final round, if you can.  Eight total points today.  T-3 as of right now.  
J.J. SPAUN: Yeah, I'm very pleased with how I played.  I mean, would have been nice to put a little more pressure on Putty, but he played great, and I limped in on the last hole.  But to only loss one point, still stay T-3, it is what it is.  But overall it's a good week.   
 Q.  Every spot counts, too, in the FedExCup standings, you'll hop into the top 50.  A little bit of a bump.  And just comment on that as we wind down towards the playoffs?  
J.J. SPAUN: It's better than taking an off week like a lot of people did.  I like to be playing good headed into tournaments, and I've got the PGA next week.  I'm kind of happy with how I'm putting things together.  It's not completely there, but at least I know I can kind of manage the game right now and have some decent rounds.
