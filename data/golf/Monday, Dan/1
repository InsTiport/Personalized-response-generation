Q.  How was practice today?
DAN MONDAY:  Practice was good.  The golf course is getting extremely difficult, but we wouldn't have it any other way.  Difficult is what it's supposed to be.
Q.  So do you feel confident about the tournament tomorrow?
DAN MONDAY:  I do.  I really do.  I'm just a club pro on a hall pass having a good time.  I have my son caddieing for me and it's just a great time.
