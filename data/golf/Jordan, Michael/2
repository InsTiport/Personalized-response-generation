 Q.  How was it out there? 
 MICHAEL JORDAN:  A lot of fun.  You know, we had a good time.  It always gives me a chance to spend time with him.  Our schedules are very hectic and rarely do we have a chance to spend time, and even though it was on the golf course, I still had a good time playing with him. 

 Q.  That's what golf is all about, isn't it? 
 MICHAEL JORDAN:  You're absolutely right.
