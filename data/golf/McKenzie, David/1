Q. How good was that round in the conditions today?
DAVID McKENZIE: The first eight or nine holes, I hit it really well, and made a lot of putts.  I missed probably about an 8- or 9-footer on No. 9 to shoot 5-under around the front nine.  But then it started to rain and I was kind of back into the wind.  So you're right, it did get tough.
Q. Do you like links golf?
DAVID McKENZIE: I love it.  I enjoy the challenge of different shots.  It gives you lots of different options.  You can hit it along the ground, bump it and run it and hit it in the air.  You've got to use your imagination.  It's fun.
Q. How difficult were conditions today compared to the first two days?
DAVID McKENZIE: The wind laid down a little bit and the course is a bit softer, so you can get at it a bit.  But the rain was constant from the 8th to the 17th.  So just got wet and hunkered down and do the best you can.
Q. I suppose it was important for you to get off to a good start today?
DAVID McKENZIE: Especially.  You play almost all the front nine downwind.  You play, what is it, I think the fourth hole is the only hole playing into the wind.  To get yourself off to a good start is really, really important.
Q. You're in a good position, only two shots off the lead.  Nice to play yourself into contention before the final round?
DAVID McKENZIE: It's always good to play well and to have a good result.  It sort of surprised me that guys have come back a bit, but again, you never know.  These bunkers out here can catch you, and if the rough catches you, you miss a putt, all of a sudden you drop two or three shots without even blinking an eye.
Q. What type of weather would suit your game tomorrow?
DAVID McKENZIE: I would like it firm, bouncy and sunny, but I don't think I'm going to get any of that.  Whatever I get, I'll take.
