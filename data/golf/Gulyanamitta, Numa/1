  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Numa Gulyanamitta into the interview room.   Thanks for joining us.   Good round today, 5‑under par.   Take me through the day.   
NUMA GULYANAMITTA:   Well, I start the day okay.   Kind of like got a bogey, bounce back birdie, then birdie, bogey kind of thing.   
Starting the back nine, I start rolling the ball good, start making putts.   I hit the ball closer.   I chip it in on nine.   That's the start of things going good, like going up.   It was kind of like an okay day, like just a normal day.   I just happened to play good, made a couple putts that I need to.   
I holed one long putt, that's all.   Today it was kind of like short putts all day long.   
THE MODERATOR:   You're a rookie on the LPGA Tour.   Can you tell me how the transition has gone for you so far.  
NUMA GULYANAMITTA:   It's been interesting.   I've been trying to get used to the Tour and stuff, it's my first year.   Don't really know where to go.   First time I get to the tournament, I be like, Where am I supposed to go, where do I get my registration done?   That's the first couple tournaments.   Then after you've been doing that for a while, you get used to it.   Now it's normal now.   I can do anything like a normal LPGA player.   
THE MODERATOR:   Who is your Big Sister?   
NUMA GULYANAMITTA:   Heather Bowie Young.   
THE MODERATOR:   Has she helped you a lot?   
NUMA GULYANAMITTA:   Actually I don't even know.   We never really talk to each other.   Because if I have a question, I would ask my sister, Russamee.   She knows a lot, so I pretty much ask her and I never really use a Big Sister.   
Everybody asked me who is my Big Sister the first time.   I was like, I don't know, I have no idea, I have to go back and look it up.   That's kind of bad.   I have really bad communication with the other people.   
THE MODERATOR:   I don't think anyone knows, but your sister played on the LPGA Tour for a while.   You don't get to see her a whole lot.   
NUMA GULYANAMITTA:   No, I don't.   Not at all.   We don't really keep contact with each other.   It's going to be through my mom.   My mom is going to tell me, Your sister is doing this, doing this.   Then she's going to tell her what am I doing now instead of talking to each other, it's just going through people.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   What was the best part of your game today?  
NUMA GULYANAMITTA:   I would say it was the chipping part, like a short‑game kind of thing.   I made a couple up‑and‑downs, really good ones, that I didn't expect to make it.   I just happened to be good today, so that was good.   
THE MODERATOR:   You had a successful collegiate career.   Do you think that's going to help you heading into the next few days?   
NUMA GULYANAMITTA:   Yeah, it's going to help me.   It's been helping me a whole year.   I have experience, a big thing, play in a big tournament kind of thing before.   It's going to help me a little bit just get through the day, trying to be confident and keep my game going.   
THE MODERATOR:   All right, Numa.   Thank you.   
NUMA GULYANAMITTA:   Thank you.
