 Q.  Give us an overall assessment of how things went.  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I played really solid today.  Tee-to-green, I played exceptionally well.  Really nothing I would change.  I maybe got a little bit aggressive on my eighth hole but outside of that, nothing to complain about.   
Just I had three 3-putts today, which damaged the scorecard a bit.  Felt like I played exceptionally well, and it would have been nice to scrape a couple of those away.   
But overall, very happy with the round.  It's such a difficult golf course, and just nice to get through in red figures.   
 Q.  Give us an overall insight into conditions today, a lot different to yesterday?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I think I got fortunate with the draw.  The wind died a little bit towards the end of the round.  I know this morning, it was quite windy, and you know, it definitely -- yesterday was just perfect weather.   
I mean, beautiful, sunny, warm, no wind, and today it was about probably 60-degrees cooler and there were a lot of gusty and swirling winds, which made getting your yardages right quite difficult.   
 Q.  Only a few shots off going into the weekend.  An exciting prospect in store?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I'm very much looking forward to the weekend.  I like the golf course a lot.  The sight lines set up well for me, so I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  What's your mind-set, being only a few behind?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: It's the same game plan all week.  It's worked thus far, and hopefully it will continue to work the next two days.
