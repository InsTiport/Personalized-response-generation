 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: You know, really just trying to stick to the game plan, plodding along.  It's difficult in my first major - you have the nerves going on, all the people around and it's just really nice for -- stick to the game plan, go out and execute and come away with a nice starting round.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, I think that links golf really suits my game really well.  I'm very happy with how I plotted my way around the course.  Yeah, I think this place suits me quite well, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Throughout the round.  Mainly first tee jitters, but I was pretty calm throughout the round.  But it's nice to hold it together coming down the stretch.  There are some difficult tee balls, some bunkers that you don't really want to hit it in.  So it's nice to get through and make a few birdies on the back nine.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I think there's no question I got the good draw.  I would say I got the good draw today, as well.  Looked like this morning the guys that went off early it was raining and cold and windy, but very pleased with the draw I got.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: No, I was totally fine.  Honestly I was very calm.  I've been very calm all week.  The first tee jitters were there, for sure, but once I got that first ball off and down the middle I was good to go.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, you know, a lot of times I think about the holes, it helps me fall asleep, kind of going through the golf course.  But nothing -- I try to stay a little bit off the golf topic whenever I'm not out here.  You might drive yourself crazy if you think about it too much.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, I mean, I'm very happy with how I played.  I think it's something that I can do again.  It didn't take anything extraordinary to do it out there, it just took solid ball-striking with a good game plan.  And just some good fortune with a couple of putts rolling in.  Yeah, I feel like this place suits me very well, and I think I can go around there composed throughout the week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Not much about this week.  We mainly just talked about the golf course.  We went around the course in the practise round with my coach, Cameron McCormick.  And we just kind of spoke with the strategy here, how far we want to fly it on holes like No. 1, where you have so many different options, and just mainly things the golf course.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: You know, they never really bothered me.  I knew in my mind I made the right decision.  Not really, I don't really think about it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: No, I mean, I don't think so.  I like being -- I like going around the course just being very calm.  I like just being relaxed and pretty much carefree.  I don't think about very many things like that.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Just relax.  I'm going to go grab some dinner with my family.  It's nice to have my granddad here.  He was able to make it.  He showed up yesterday.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Back in December, Web.com Q School.  It's nice to have him and my parents here.  And just going to rest and get ready for tomorrow.  Got an early tee time.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: My dad's dad.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: You know, not too much, no.  I had a really nice dinner with him a couple of nights ago.  And we got to chat a little bit about the week ahead.  But nothing too specific.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Correct, yes, Bill Connelly is his name.
