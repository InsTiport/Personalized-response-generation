 Q.  You must be absolutely delighted with the start?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Thrilled.  It's very difficult out there.  It's nice to stick to my game plan and make some putts and really feel like I played very well today.   
 Q.  What's the key to getting around this course?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Well, avoiding big misses.  You have to make sure when you mis-hit a shot, it's still directionally straight and in front of you.  You have to make sure you don't short-side yourself out here; it's a guaranteed bogey if you do, unless you hole some miracle putt.   
 Q.  Perfect conditions out there.  How much did that help you?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: It helps a lot.  It helps because I feel like I know where I'm hitting it.  I feel like you get wind picking up and dying sometimes.  It can swirl through these trees.  It gets windy, it becomes very, very difficult to control your ball.   
 Q.  What's the game plan for tomorrow?  Anything different?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I just can't get myself in any binds.  I'll take my medicine, hit it to where I can at least give myself a chance to get up-and-down for the next one.  Just the same game plan all week.  Just it's a grind out there.
