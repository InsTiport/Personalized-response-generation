AUSTIN CONNELLY: If felt amazing.  I played very solid today.  It was nice to get off to the start I got off to.  It's not very often you're 3-under through 2 on two par-4s, or ever, really.  So it was just incredible the rush you get from making a shot like that so early in the round with the crowd as big as it was.  I just tried to stay composed after that, keep moving forward.  A little hiccup on the next hole, which wasn't ideal.  But overall I'm very pleased with the round.  It's nice to stay patient throughout the day and get rewarded with a couple of birdies on the last two.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I never felt nerves from the first tee on, which is surprising to me.  I was very calm.  I think it has to do with I'm very confident with how I'm hitting it.  And so I'm not standing on any tee nervous about where it might go.  I feel like I'm hitting it straight and solid.  And it's just translating into being very calm.   
 Q.  20 years old, how does it feel?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: It's a dream come true.  It's something I've been dreaming about and picturing myself here for a long time.  And it's really just nice to be here.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: You know, it's hard to tell coming into the week.  I knew that I liked the golf course a lot.  I felt very comfortable and I liked the way my game was trending.  And of course I'm very pleased with where it's led me thus far.  But I wouldn't say it's surprised me the way I've played.  I would say more than anything it's surprised me that the numbers haven't been a little bit lower.  I've played very well and I think I might just feel that way because the golf course fits me so well and it fits my eye.   
 Q.  How will you feel tomorrow standing on the first tee?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I think I'll feel the same way I felt today, confident.  I'm just going to stand up there and hit every shot to the best of my ability.   
 Q.  Golf is such a fickle game.  You're 20, it's your first Major Championship.  Conventional wisdom says you're not supposed to be doing so well, why are you?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I guess long hours of hard work and practise.  And just picturing myself here.  I've believed when I turned professional that I was going to rise and be able to play with the best in the world.  And it's just nice to have that confirmed.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, you know, I'm very pleased with how I'm playing.  It's nice to be in this position.  It's nice that the putt went in in a qualifier to get here.  It's just been a really special week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I'm still rooting for him, yeah.  I hope the best -- I hope he plays well tomorrow.  I hope everyone plays well tomorrow.  I just hope that I have my "A" game.  I can only control what I can control.  So I'm just going to go out there and do the best I can.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, I had 145 yards into the wind off the right.  I hit 9-iron, just as flush as I could hit it.  And I got the best results I could possibly get, which was nice.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, I would love to play.  It's going to depend on how tomorrow goes.  I want to make sure I have my European Tour card secured for next year first.  But obviously I'd love to go back and play in Toronto.  It's really one of my favourite tournaments I've played so far.   
So it would be an honour to go back, and to receive an invitation this morning was very humbling and very nice.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, I wasn't so much thinking about it like that.  I was more just taking the whole experience with the crowd there and the giant leaderboard, it's not something you see every day.   
 Q.  Have you had any surreal moments?  
AUSTIN CONNELLY: The shot on No. 2 today was pretty incredible.  The crowd went crazy.  Obviously I couldn't see it go in because of the sun, so it was pretty neat.
