AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, you know, I played very solid today.  It was extremely difficult out there.  It was very windy, got very cold, as well.  It was definitely a rough start on the front nine.  But it was nice to battle back the way I did.  The main issue I had out there was just hitting way too many bunkers.  I think I plugged it in three bunkers, and you just can't do that.
Happy with the way I played.  Happy with the way I hit it.  It was just very difficult out there.  Take a lot of positives away from it.  Great experience, Major Championship on Sunday.  Yeah, just looking forward to getting back into the same position.
Q. (Inaudible.)
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Oh, absolutely.  I'm very blessed to have been put in that situation.  I played quite well this week.  I take nothing but positives away from it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
AUSTIN CONNELLY: I'm going to go -- next week?  Next week I'm going to Germany.  I'm going to go catch a flight right now, actually.
Q. (Inaudible.)
AUSTIN CONNELLY: No, I'm just going to play the European Tour the rest of the year.
Q. (Inaudible.)
AUSTIN CONNELLY: Yeah, I mean it should be fine.  It will be good.  Just like normal, just had a good week this week and hopefully have another one next week.
