Q. How would you describe the conditions and the test of survival out here on a day like this?
CAMERON CHAMP: It's just a grind.  You have to just stay positive.  I hit it very well today.  I hit a few loose shots, but with the weather coming in, I just kind of parred it in.  I had the one birdie on 18, which was very unlikely.  I hit it pretty firm and it went in.
Q. What were the odds of that going in?  You're trying to get done and as you said you hit it a little too hard?
CAMERON CHAMP: They probably weren't very good.  Like I said, the hole was still the hole.  It was a lot of water.  We were all just trying to get to the house.
Q. The last time you played Pebble Beach before this week was back in 2012 PGA TOUR Champions event.  Your grandfather Max was on the bag for you.  The man that taught you the game.  What are the memories you have from seven years ago?
CAMERON CHAMP: Oh, that will still last with me.  Like I said, he walked 72 holes, for how old he was.  The week after he was hurting, but it's just great memories and we played well that week, too.
Q. How would you describe the last six months, coming off the WEB.COM TOUR, winning in Mississippi, and now on the covers of a lot of golf magazines.  How have you been able to keep it all in check?
CAMERON CHAMP: It's just been fun.  I've been enjoying it.  Just trying to stay positive about it and just trying to block out everything you hear.  But it's something I'm enjoying and still getting used to, but for the first year it's going well.
