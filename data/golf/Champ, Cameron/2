  CAMERON CHAMP:   Really I'm just hitting the ball off the tee, really found the driver.  I was able to give myself a lot of chances, hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in, and that's just how it goes.  But if I keep hitting it like I am and keep giving myself chances, eventually they'll fall.
 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 CAMERON CHAMP:   It was awesome.  It was good to see him.  He was stoked about it, and him and his father, my dad, walked today.  I'm sure they chatted it up and he had a great experience, I hope.
