CAMERON CHAMP: I had some nerves and just started doing everything real quick, just got out of my rhythm.  Started on 8, just slowly got it back and was able to fight the whole day, at least get three back from where I started.
Q. It's pretty tough to get the wheels back on, or does that come naturally to you?
CAMERON CHAMP: No, once I calmed down, slowed down, I think it was on 5 tee, I hit a great tee ball there and calmed down.
7, my second shot was quick.  But after that I just finally slowed down and just kept my normal speed routine and pre-shot and all that stuff and I was fine after that.
Q. Scottie played a lot earlier than you.  Did you notice he had gotten off to such a good start?
CAMERON CHAMP: I know he was playing well, from what I understood.
Q. He was 4-under at the turn, but then he tripled the last hole.
CAMERON CHAMP: Okay.
Q. He started strong, had a tough finish.  So you think that's the way it's going to be tomorrow, you're just going to play your game?
CAMERON CHAMP: Yeah, I've just got to slow down and start.  Just too excited and nerves, those two don't go too well together.
Q. But it's a great opportunity, big crowd.
CAMERON CHAMP: Yes.
