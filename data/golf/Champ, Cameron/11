 Q.  Nice putting. Just talk me through that round.  
CAMERON CHAMP: Made some good putts and good saves and then just kind of started hitting some more quality shots.   
I'm putting good, so just trying to give myself as many looks as possible. The ones I gave, I was able to make the putts, so...   
 Q.  How important were those birdies coming home this morning?  
CAMERON CHAMP: They're big. Kind of momentum boosters. Like I said, I've been hitting it pretty decent for the most part. Now starting to get the putter going. I'm getting up and down when I need to.   
 Q.  Does it give you confidence being back here knowing you got the job down here a year ago?  
CAMERON CHAMP: Oh, definitely. Definitely a comfort factor. I like the course. Sets up sell for me. So I know if I just play my game kind of everything falls into place.
