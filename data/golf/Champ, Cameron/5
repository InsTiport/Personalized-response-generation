  Q. Cameron, I know this week hasn't gone as you might have expected, but you're still very much in the bubble mix heading into tomorrow.  What are your thoughts with one day to go?
 CAMERON CHAMP:   Yeah, I knew today was an important today, if I could shoot around par or shoot a few under just to give myself a chance tomorrow, and I did that.  You know, as the day goes on, the course gets harder, so again tomorrow obviously will be a slightly early tee time, but if I can kind of play how I did today and get a few putts to fall, you never know.
 Q. With everything that comes with making it to East Lake, is it hard to put that aside and focus on the round tomorrow?
 CAMERON CHAMP:   Oh, definitely.  Like I said, it's a tough golf course.  I like the way it looks.  It favors me.  Again, if I can just hit it the way I did today and kind of putt the way I did and get a few of those 15-, 20-footers to go and post a number, then we'll have to wait and see.
