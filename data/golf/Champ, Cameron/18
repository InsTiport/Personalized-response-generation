Q. Cameron, just get some comments on your round today.
CAMERON CHAMP: Yeah, you know, kind of just been struggling with the swing a little bit; just getting a little quick.
But, you know, coming down the backside just kind of slowed down a little bit.  Made a very lucky birdie on 12 that kind of got me going on that five-birdie stretch.
So, yeah, it was just great to finish the day like that.
Q. Hole looked pretty big during that stretch?
CAMERON CHAMP: Definitely.  I was just hitting quality shots, just giving myself chances.  On 15 I kind of just pitched it left, just a take out long kind of where my pitch shot was, and I was able to make that.
Then 16 an errant drive, but then hit a good second shot up there just past the green and two-putted from there.
