Q. Tell me about the state of your game and how you played out there.
CAMERON CHAMP: I played amazing, I hit it extremely good, I got some putts going. Unfortunately I made really only two mistakes all day, misreads on 8 and then the missed tee ball on 18. So beside that I made 8 birdies on this course, I'll take that any day. So all around, even with two doubles, it was a solid day.
Q. Coming out to a course like this and a tournament like this, what's the overall feel of a week like this?
CAMERON CHAMP: It's amazing, it's the PLAYERS Championship, we have the crowds, obviously that may change, but just the atmosphere of the event, the prestige of the event, the players that have won, the players that are playing. A lot of players feel like it's the fifth major. It's different.
Q. Playing college events, a few fans, it might feel something like that tomorrow. So how are you going to gauge the atmosphere and how strange is it going to be on the first tee?
CAMERON CHAMP: The first tee probably won't be bad. But 16, 17, some of those will be a little weird, I think. But, hey, it's a situation we're in, just going to embrace it and just keep playing like I am.
