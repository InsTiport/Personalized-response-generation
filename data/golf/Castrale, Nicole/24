   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  Thank you all for coming in.  We have with us Nicole Castrale, Brittany Lincicome, and Stacy Prammanasudh. 
 Okay.  Thank you all for coming in.  Y'all, it's kind of interesting.  Y'all obviously have played golf for awhile and been on Tour for a few years.  This is your first Solheim Cup.  Does it feel different to kind of be in the position as rookies this week? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I don't know if we really think of ourselves as rookies.  At least I don't.  We play with these players day in and day out, and they don't treat us like we're rookies, except Juli Inkster told me I had to pack her luggage on the way home. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Told me that, too. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Guess we're double dipping.  (Laughter.) 
 Other than that, no.  I have to think we're all pretty confident.  We've all had success at a high level.  It's just great to be out here as a team with the other players. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  The only thing that would classify us as a rookie is that this is just our first Solheim Cup experience.  We've all played match play back in the States, so I definitely don't consider it a rookie experience. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Cristie Kerr said after your first shot in the first round, you're not a rookie anymore. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  We're getting closer. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  That's great.  We have questions for the three women. 

 Q.  You came out here I think about six weeks ago and played.  Did that put you -- give you some good preparation for playing here? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, the course is playing a little bit different than it did when we were here after the British.  It's in really great shape now.  I'm sure they were just in the preparations when we were here earlier but, you know, just to have seen it one other time before, just really helps with your practice rounds, and that way you know what shots you need to work on in preparation for coming here. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  The greens are beautiful.  They're real nice. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I think it just makes us all comfortable.  Like we know where the clubhouse is, where our team room is, know where the bathrooms are, know how to get to the driving range.  It gives us a sense of just knowing what's going on. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Playing together, just kind of looking with your team as well as with your captains, how is everyone feeling about that. 

 Q.  Have y'all been having a good time together? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Betsy is starting to go break out of her shell.  She's normally very quiet and calm. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  She's honking golf cart horns.  She's crazy.  No.  I mean, I just think it's awesome.  We've only really been together about a day or so.  We all get along so well.  I just think good things are going to happen. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Ping-pong is on later, by the way. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Bring it. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Are we going to have to post the daily ping-pong results? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Exactly. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Brittany and I are two up. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Switch partners on us.  Pat is our partner.  We were winning too much. 

 Q.  Do you guys have much fan support coming over here to watch you? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I actually thought there were more Americans out here today than I thought there would be, and that was actually surprising.  You know, I think we'll have a good amount of support.  But when you're -- we knew going into this week we're the underdogs and not on our home turf.  We have to play hard to win, and I think we're up to the challenge. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  We have some of our families here. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  What does it mean for two of you?  Is Pete over here for you to have family members or even husbands on the bag for you?  Is that comforting?  What kind of experience is that to share a Solheim Cup with him? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Makes it extra special, being our first one and having a loved one like a husband on the bag to share it with.  It just makes it that much more special. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Yeah.  I think it's pretty cool that like Stacy and Pete.  It's Stacy's first and Pete's first just as it is For Craig and I.  It's pretty neat. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  My caddie and I fight like we're married.  Does that count? (laughter) 
NICOLE CASTRALE:  She doesn't listen to him, either. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  That's why we fight. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Brittany, they are 3-3 going into the afternoon matches, if you were wondering.  Is that any different?  Do you carry some of that experience coming on? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  It's kind of a weird feeling, especially if they get to come to watch the first round.  You see them there and myself actually being on the golf course.  It feels like yesterday that I was out there trying to cheer the girls on.  So it's just kind of funny how the world goes around and how the hard work and everything has paid off and I'm here playing on the actual team. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Any other questions for them? 

 Q.  What about playing in Europe? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  The veterans that have played Solheims over here before have kind of warned us.  It's a different atmosphere.  We kind of know it going in.  We're not going to really know until it's actually happening, and, you just, got to know going in that it is going to be different and you have to stay focused and do what you have to do and play your own golf game. 

 Q.  Stacy, have you played in Sweden before? 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  I played in Scandinavia in an event earlier. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Just at the practice round out here. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Any other questions? 

 Q.  What's your hotel like?  Are you pleased with the accommodation? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I think it's very nice. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  It's cozy. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Small. 
 STACY PRAMMANASUDH:  Cozy. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  We have an awesome team room.  Awesome job with that. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I think they're cute. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  We can't give away our secrets what we have in there. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  Weird people. 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  It's good.  It's convenient, close to the golf course.  Food has been good so far.  We're just looking forward to playing. 

 Q.  Brittany, can you remember the result of your matches in the Junior Solheim, who you played? 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  I have no idea.  I know we won one, last one, but I have no idea. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  We have those records if you're interested. 
 BRITTANY LINCICOME:  We'll look it up. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  Anything else?  Thank you all for coming.  Good luck this week, ladies.
