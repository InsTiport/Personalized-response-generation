   NICOLE CASTRALE:  We're bringing the Cup back.   
  
  Q.  One point deficit into this final series.  Were you always comfortable that your team could come from behind?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Apparently it's the best start ever even being a point back.  I was optimistic.  I knew we had 12 awesome players on our team and we've got a lot of heart.  I think that's what it came down to.   
  
  Q.  Congratulations.   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Thanks.   
  
  Q.  Well done.  How satisfying is this for you?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  It's pretty neat.  I think I'm speechless right now, and, you know, just looking forward to being up there for the team.  And I don't know, don't have much more to say.   
  
  Q.  How nervous were you this morning, you had singles?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I haven't really been -- of course, I'm going to be nervous.  I knew I needed to take care of myself and just keep executing golf shots.  That's what I did, especially this afternoon, played really good, hit a lot of fairways and greens.  Putted the ball really well.  It was awesome.   
  
  Q.  Is this everything -- is this Solheim Cup everything everybody told you?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  It absolutely surpassed my expectations.  It's one of the best weeks of my life, and it will go down as something I'll always remember it.   
  
  Q.  This year has been pretty special, hasn't it?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  To finish this way, I couldn't, you know -- I couldn't pick this year to go any differently than it has.  It's pretty awesome.   
  
  Q.  Come a long way, huh?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Sure have.
