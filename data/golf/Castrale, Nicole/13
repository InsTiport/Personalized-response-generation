   JASON TAYLOR: Thanks for joining us today. Nice rounds. You're 4-under, currently one shot back from the lead in the clubhouse. What did you think of your performance today?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE: I felt like I played solid. Really got on a hot streak on the back 9, which was my front 9. Shot a 5-under on that side.  
 A lot of good shots on the 9 coming in and just didn't quite make as many putts. Overall, still a good day.  
 JASON TAYLOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. You're still at 5-under coming in. Take me through that last bogey that got you a shot down?  
 NICOLE CASTRALE: I had 177 pin and I pulled 5-iron just left of the green and didn't hit a very good chip shot to about ten feet short.   
 Hit a really good putt and lipped out hard. All you can do at this point is hit a good putt, and if it goes in, it goes it. You know, like I said, hot a lot of good shots and a lot of good putts, so definitely happy with where I'm at.  
  
  Q. It's kind of hot and muggy out there. How has the course played today?  
 NICOLE CASTRALE: The air is definitely heavy, and it was pretty breezy at times. The greens are very receptive, so that's the only thing you really have in your favor.   
 The golf course is in great shape and the greens are rolling well. It just really depends on the wind and the rain that we're expected to get.
