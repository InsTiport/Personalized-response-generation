 Q.  The shot coming in at 18, how much harder was that? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Well, I was just trying to do what I needed to do to make a good golf swing.  I didn't make a good golf swing on 18 the second time in a row.  I mean, it happens.  What are you going to do? 

 Q.  Talk about your emotions.  Did you think you were out?  Did you think you were in? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Really I didn't have really much time to really get up or down.  I didn't know whether I was in or out really at any point.  Like I said, I was just trying to go out there and hit good golf shots. 

 Q.  You and Juli had a pretty good front nine and then you both basically struggled on the back nine.  What was that like for both of you when the two of you made birdie on 3, you guys were fist pumping? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Oh, absolutely.  We're good friends so we were trying to feed off each other.  We did a great job on the front nine, 32 and 33, and the back nine, we just hit a few loose shots.  We still were trying to get each other fired up going down 15, and just neither one of us played well on the back nine.  It happens. 

 Q.  What did you have on 18 in regulation? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I had 142 in regulation and then 148 in the playoff. 

 Q.  What did you hit? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I hit 8-iron in regulation, 7 in the playoff.
