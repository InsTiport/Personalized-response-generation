  Q. Nicole, you gave it a really good run. That putt on 17, how long was it and what did you see when you stood up to that ball?  
 NICOLE CASTRALE: It was about a 12-footer and we had hit that putt in the practice rounds, so we knew exactly where it went, and I just got up to it and made a good, committed stroke. We just came up a little short today.  
  
  Q. These guys are pretty tough, aren't they?  
 NICOLE CASTRALE: Yeah, they played good and made key birdies on 15 and 16 and 18.
