 Q. What's it -- she's your roommate and watching her do this, what's the feeling that goes through?NICOLE CASTRALE: It's awesome.  I've always looked up to Juli.  She's such a role model.  She's a mom and obviously a Hall of Famer, but Juli is just Juli.  What you see is what you get.  She's very real.  She has a huge heart and so it's fun to stay together.  It's definitely fun knowing that this could be her last kind of send off like that.  So it's been a fun week.
Q. Not to reveal great secrets or anything, but what's it like rooming with her?  I mean as if there's years of wisdom right there at your feet.NICOLE CASTRALE: Oh, absolutely.  She's always trying to just give insight about golf and events and just life in general, being a mom.  She's one of my good friend out here.  So, it's been fun.  Making dinners at night.  She made dinner the night I was late, so it was ready when I got home.  And vice versa, I made dinner for her last night.  I'm guessing I might have to make the same dinner again tonight.  So that's what I'm waiting to find out if I need to go to the store.
Q. What did you have for dinner?NICOLE CASTRALE: Pork chops and pasta and garlic bread.  Are we having pork chops again? (Laughter.)
Q. Pork chops before the third round, right?NICOLE CASTRALE: Yeah.
