  Q.  You have to be satisfied with your round overall.   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Absolutely.  It was a good day and definitely moved my position up and I think I'm in a good position going into tomorrow and we'll just see what happens.   
  
  Q.  Does this solidify anything, just after your win last week; that you're right there?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I feel like I'm playing well right now.   
 So I'm really just kind of riding it and just doing the best I can, trying to hit fairways and greens out here, because the rough is so penalizing.  Two 1-putts kind of help.   
  
  Q.  How do you adjust to the wind?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Well, the wind seemed to be coming out of a different direction today.  So you just have to really be patient and pick your targets and really just do the best you can, because it's playing tough for everyone.   
  
  Q.  Are you looking at this tournament any different than last year with how it's playing and your mentality?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I'm just looking at it trying to do the best I can each day.  Obviously I feel like I'm riding a bit of momentum off last week.  I'm just going to enjoy it and keep on going.   
  
  Q.  And your plan for tomorrow?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Fairways and greens and 1-putts help.
