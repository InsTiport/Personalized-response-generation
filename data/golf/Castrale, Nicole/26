  Q.  Pretty cut and dried.  What were you doing particularly well and what was turning for you in the match, do you think?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  You know, I just played well from the start.  I was just trying to hit fairways and greens and make the putts when I had chances to.  I got off to an early lead, and so just the momentum was kind of on my side.   
  
  Q.  Was there a hole or was there a shot or something that kind of really seized the day for you?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  No, I don't think so.  I just like I said, I felt like I played well all day and really didn't make too many mistakes, and that was kind of the key.   
  
  Q.  Was it just you more or less playing your game or did your opponent have some trouble?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I would say it was a combination of both.  You know, I think especially early on in the match, you need to focus on what you need to do to play well and not worry so much about the other person.   
 You know, as the stretch, maybe strategize more, but I was just trying to focus on me and do the best I can out there.   
  
  Q.  Is this year your first year in the event?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Last year.   
  
  Q.  Easier this year, or tell me how so.   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  My World Ranking is better.  My first match last year was against Mi Hyun Kim and I think I shot 4-under and still lost 3 & 2.  So, you know, played well last year and lost.  I mean, anything can happen in match play.  I mean, it really doesn't matter what your World Ranking is.  Like I said, if you just take care of yourself and play the golf course and see what happens.   
  
  Q.  How did the match start; did you win the first few holes and then seize command there and then it was just a matter of finishing it out?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I was 3-up after three, and then lost 4 to a birdie.  And then ended up getting -- actually I was 6-up going to 12 and then made a bogey.  Just kind of had a little brain lapse.  Then made a good par on 13 and 14.   
  
  Q.  Where did the match end?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  On 14, so 5 & 4.   
  
  Q.  Pretty solid, good step up for you.   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Yeah, it's good to be done early and get some rest.
