 Q.  Just talk a little bit about your round today.  You had a pretty good round, some big names up there.  How do you feel? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Good.  Like you said, all the names are good at the top, so I'm going to have to post two good rounds on the weekend to have a chance. 

 Q.  What was the course like today?  Was the wind a factor? 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  It wasn't quite as windy as it was yesterday, and we were anticipating high winds and didn't get them, so it was actually nice.

 Q.  What are you looking for with (inaudible). 
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I'm just looking forward to sticking with my game plan, hitting fairways and greens, and making a few putts and seeing what happens.
