  Q.  I'm here with Nicole Castrale and Cristie Kerr.  Looking like a slaughterhouse out there.  5-down with 6 to play.  What did you say to yourself and what happened?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  We knew we had to start doing it.  Hit good irons.  Cristie made some awesome putts.  It was close.   
  
  Q.  Cristie, how proud are you of Nicole?   
 CRISTIE KERR:  So proud.  She was great on 17.  We played pretty sloppy the front-9, but we were 5-down.  I missed a couple putts to get it 5-down.  I said, you know what, you start getting it up and start making it.  Damned if we didn't.   
  
  Q.  How about that shot at 17?  How special was that?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I had 105.  I hit it perfectly.  Came off all, it looked like it was going in.   
 CRISTIE KERR:  Hit the pin.   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  Cristie made a great putt.  She focused and made the putt.  We gave it our all down the stretch and that was it.   
 CRISTIE KERR:  Even though we lost it, doesn't feel like we lost.   
 Conditional page break: 2   
  
  Q.  Are you tired?   
 NICOLE CASTRALE:  I'm looking forward to it.  I'm looking forward to the first point in the Solheim Cup.   
  
  Q. Alright, guys.
