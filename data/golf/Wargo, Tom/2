 Q.   Can you give some initial comments about how Bellerive was playing today?  
TOM WARGO:   I think it's playing quite soft.   They didn't set it up extremely hard.   There's a lot of good rounds as I guess it looks like there's quite few guys that's in the red.   
So if you drive it good here, same old stuff, the irons, if you can hit a few irons, you can get in the red pretty easily I thought.   I didn't think it was overly hard.   I know I didn't have a good day, I made a couple of bad strokes and it cost me dearly, but other than that, I think the golf course is playing, it's ready to be had a little bit.   There's a lot of guys in the red.  
   
 Q.   Was there a hole or a set of holes that kind of proved crucial to a turning point in your round today?  
TOM WARGO:   Which way?   Up or down?   
(Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   Either way.   
TOM WARGO:   Well, no, I was cruising right along and I hit a bad iron on 6, I mean on the first hole I hit a 6‑iron in, I pulled it in that left bunker and kind of hit a bad bunker play and then 3‑putted for a double and then hit it in the water on 6.   That was where my play come bad.   I hit it in the water and then I went and dropped one and misread the yardage just enough and hit it in the water and made seven.
