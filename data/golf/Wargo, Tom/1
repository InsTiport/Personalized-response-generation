Q.   How is it playing in front of family and friends here today?
TOM WARGO:   Well, it's always enjoyable to coming back to St. Louis and see ‑‑ and the surrounding area, I played all my golf in this area and I mean it was nice to see the people that I haven't seen for a year being on the road for the last 20 years, it's awful nice to see them and to have some of the people coming out of the crowd that I haven't seen in a long time.   It's very nice.   I enjoyed it.   It felt good to see them.

Q.   Talk about your round today.   35 on the back and 42 on the front. 
TOM WARGO:   Well, I just got off to a bad start.   I hit some bad irons, I played extremely well basically and in the two days, but I drove it really good enough to be probably in contention to make the cut, but my irons were just terrible.   I probably made three, I think I made three doubles and a quad off my irons.   So that kind of kept us behind the 8‑ball all the time.   The irons, I struggled with them all the tournament.

Q.   Beautiful week here for golf. 
TOM WARGO:   Oh, you can't ask for anything better.   The spectators are having a great week.   I hope the people show up.   This is always a good golf town and they will show up tomorrow and Sunday.   They like to see good golf and these boys will show them some golf here on this golf course.
