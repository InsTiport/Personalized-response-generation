Q.   Talk about the course. 
TOM WARGO:   It's generous a little bit, but you got to play the golf course enough to know where the pins are at and try to work your way to the pins from back to front or left‑to‑right, so you can give yourself some opportunities to at least try to get the ball up‑and‑down. 

Q.   You were born and raised in Marlette?
TOM WARGO:   No, born in Marlette, but I went to school in Mayville and Lapeer.   I left Michigan when I was 30. 

Q.   Do you still have friends up there?
TOM WARGO:   Yes, I do.   I have a good friend here working for me here right now.
