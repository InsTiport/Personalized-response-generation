 Q. Your thoughts about this round.
 
 TOM WARGO: Steady. Just good and steady and nothing wild and nothing exciting,
basically. Four birdies, two bogeys. 
 
Q. Pretty different course today from yesterday?
 
 TOM WARGO: Yeah, much so. Obviously the wind is not blowing like it was yesterday and
that rain last night softened up the greens and softened up the fairways, but it also
softened up the greens so you could hit some shots out of the rough and keep it on the
greens. 
 
Q. Pretty welcomed sight, the rain?
 
 TOM WARGO: Well, yes, and one of the things, it gave us a little relief from the heat.
Yesterday that hot wind got to blowing yesterday afternoon and it got hot and it was kind
of warm coming down the stretch there. It is a nice one to go for, yeah, but I don't know
about winning. It is a long ways to go. But I work hard as a general rule in anything that
I do. I knew practice rounds Tuesday and Wednesday I hadn't really struck the ball real
well. As a matter of fact I actually shanked a couple of shots in the practice rounds so,
I had to get to the range and tried to get things worked out as quickly as I could and as
fast as I could because you are running out of time to get something ready to go for
yesterday. So far, we are kind of plugging right along.
