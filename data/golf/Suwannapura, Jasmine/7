  Q. Very well played.  How pleased are you with today's performance?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Very happy about today.  I mean, I didn't expect that I'm going to had a good score today.  I mean, you know, even though it's not raining, it's still pretty windy out there, and then you can't really expect any good score every day here.  Just try to do your best out there and play golf.
 Q. What was the approach after the last couple of days heading into today in a good position on that leaderboard?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Well, I don't really look at the leaderboard so much, but I just focus on my game, if I miss the shot, I just try to up-and-down, make some par.  Just play my own game, really.  Like just do my best.
 Q. What will be the focus for you tomorrow?  What will you need to do to try and win this wonderful championship?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Probably get rid of my three-putts because even though I had 3-putts every day, like the first day, I had three-putt for three holes, and then yesterday was one hole and today was one hole.  That's like five stroke that I give it away.
 Probably have to look at the speed of the green more and then just keep hitting good shots and make some putts for tomorrow and hope for the best.
