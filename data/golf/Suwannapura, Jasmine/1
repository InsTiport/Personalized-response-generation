  Q. Here with Jasmine Suwannapura.  You end your first round under par.  Seemed to be a harder golf course this morning.  Not a lot of really low scores out there.  What is it about this course that's a challenge for some of the players out here?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I think you really need to keep it on the fairway, on the green, try and give yourself opportunity.  And believe it or not, I think this green is a little tricky.  I feel like I misread a couple of them.
 But today I hit it pretty good and give a lot of opportunity for myself.
 Q. I was going to say, what were some of the challenging holes out there and what did you do best to get those birdies that you had there, especially on your front nine?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I think just, you know, hit it on the green and try not to be too aggressive.  I feel like the pin could be on a corner of the green and they're challenging you to go for it.  But I feel like the green is really firm and some of the hole you can't really go for the pin.  If not, you will be bouncing off the green and you will short side yourself and have a really hard up and down.
 So I tried to play a little safer those holes, and the hole I can attack the pin on the par-5, I try my best to attack the pin.
 Q. Have you played Lake Nona before?  Is this your first time getting used to this course?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   First time.  I never been here.  It's really nice.  I like it here.
 Q. When you first came to this course and started your practice rounds, what are some of the things you picked up on right away?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I notice that the rough is pretty thick.  I know that for the long hitter they still need to keep it in the fairway.  For us -- yeah, everybody need to keep in the fairway.  As soon as you hit in the rough the second shot will be hard.  It's either fly or like hit it way short because very thick.
 Q. One more thing.  What is there to take away from this round heading into the second one tomorrow?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Well, today I missed a lot of -- missed some of the fairway.  Like my layup shot on the par-5 was not that good, so I was leave myself in the rough on the par-5.  Yeah, those three hole I did not make birdie, but, yeah, keeping the same.  Keep it in the fairway and the green and play it safe.
 Q. And lastly, we have Annika in the field this week.  Have you been able to talk to her at all as you've been practicing?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I see her walk around and she say hi to everyone, which is very nice.  It's good to see one of the legend in golf come back and play her home course.
 I haven't really checked the score and see how she play, but it's excited to have her back.
