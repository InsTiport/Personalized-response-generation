  Q. How do you feel about your round today?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I think we pretty relax in the golf course today.  Just I make fun, I make a joke about today is like -- I didn't see the front nine like for two years, so I did not hit balls or practice on the front nine at all yesterday.  I just been in the hotel and then pretty much just hit where she tell me to do.  Like just give me the target and just go for the target.  All right, on the green; all right, in the fairway; and just keep going.  Just try to make birdies out there.
 Q. You're a feel player as you said.  How did you feel today about the different course conditions?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   It's big different for this year.  I feel like the green, fairway, and everything is very soft.
 Also, like it's hard if it's -- if you hit in the rough this year because very thick and wet.
 For the speed of the green I feel like it looks like it's going to be slow but it still roll.
 It's been all day that I feel like I need to get the speed right and try to get the chance for birdie.
 Q. From AIG to now, how do you feel about your golf game?  Is it around the same?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   About the same, yeah, because I feel like I have the same mental game from AIG, try to carry it as long as I can and see a different part of the game.
 I feel like if I can play good over there I can play good anywhere basically.
 Q. I heard Portland has amazing Thai food.  Have you had the chance to try any restaurants?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Yes.  There is a restaurant that I been there every year except last year because I didn't play here.  But I been thinking about it and I'm like, oh, is it open, is it open?  They are open.
 Q. Did you try it?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Every day.
 Q. Oh, my goodness.
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Oh, every day.
 Q. Speaking of last year, may I ask what was the decision behind not playing?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I mean, I love Portland.  I love the golf course and everything.  But I feel like when the green is firm and they always tuck the pin on the right side on the edge and you kind of like need to hit a fade to get in.
 I'm a -- hit a draw, a baby draw.  Plus the green is firm and I can't really stop the ball.  So it's not really my course.  But then this year the green is soft and everything I feel like can attack the pin more for sure.
 Q. What's your strategy heading into the last two rounds?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Just keep it in the fairway, you know, and then try to get a chance to make birdie as much I can, and hopefully I get the speed right for the green.  It's a little tricky.
 Yeah, hope for the best.  Make birdies.
 Q. Last question:  You got two stars on your (indiscernible.)  Are you excited about potentially putting on a third?
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Of course.  But I might -- you know, I had my thoughts about maybe putting on the side, on this side, or maybe a little more.  Yeah, I'll change about a little bit.  I might put some hearts or a moon or something different.
 But always open.
 Q. But third one would be great.
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Yeah, third one will be great.
 Q. Thank you so much, Jasmine, and I hope you enjoy a lot more Thai food.
 JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Oh, yeah.
