Q. Jasmine, you were able to end the day at 3-under.  How were you feeling out there on the course?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA: Pretty up and down today, like especially my front nine.  Like after the birdie I make couple mistake on 2nd hole and then end up with double.  From minus one to plus one is really quickly.
And then, yeah, talking to my caddie and thinking that it should be okay.  Like we had a lot of opportunity out there.  Just try to make birdie and we would be okay.
Yeah, just hang in there and try to find birdie, and then, yeah, happy to finish 3-under today.  It was good.
Q. Feeling the breeze a little bit towards the end your round.  Did that affect anything?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA: No.  I think like it's cool down a little bit and I feel like it's better weather.  You know, like I just had like a positive thought that the weather is getting cooler, better.  I mean, it's more fun to play golf with the nice weather.
I think the wind not too bad.  I don't think it's too windy.  We're still playing good golf.
Q. A lot of girls sit at 3-under, but there is still a lot of golf to play.  What's it going to take to break out above of that?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA: I think just got to be patient here.  Like especially a lot of hole tuck in and then small green.  Sometimes just trying to be on the green and say, you know what?  Just be done with this hole.  Don't think too much about it.
Some of the hole like time to attack the pin, and if you got a good chance you will make birdie.  Just keep it that simple.  Hopefully I had a good day and the next three day.
