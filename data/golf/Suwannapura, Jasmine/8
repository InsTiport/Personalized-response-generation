Q. Ending the day at plus 1-over all, you had quite the round out there.  Take us through what happened there.
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Today a lot of things happened today.  I had a really lucky on the par 5, it's like 142 yard and then hit 5-iron and one bounce and go in for eagle.  I'm like, I don't know, I didn't see the ball but people say it's in the hole.  Yeah, so a lot of up-and-downs and you have to be really patient.
Q. That No. 6 hole has been difficult for so many people.  What was it like for you to be able to hole out?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I mean, yesterday I made double, and today I made eagle.  That's the best way you can do.
Q. What excitement did you have throughout the round when you're able to still, despite a bogey here, a double-bogey there, that you're able to still come out with quite a good score?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Just not expect anything.  I mean, you just play with the golf course and every hole is different, different wind every hole.  It's just like mentally you just have to have fun with it and play with the golf course and just do your best out here because you never know, like one hole you hit it in the hole, eagle, and the other hole just make double.  It's just like, it's tough.
Q. That's the beauty of links golf.  We were talking the other day on the range and you said during the practise rounds it was a wash because you didn't know what to expect.  What have these two days been like?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I just know that I can play this course.  To be honest, if you know your game, you will do pretty good year because I think I know my game enough to like hit this kind of shot and expect it to be here, there, but again, you never know what's going to happen.
Q. I believe you made your first appearance in this major last year; correct?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   I'm not sure.
Q. What have you learned maybe from last year to this year?  You made the cut last year as well, but what have you learned about yourself and your play to get ready for this kind of major tournament?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   We had a long break, five, six months, and to be able to adjust to the wind this week, to be able to get a good number and be next to the hole is very important.  Be happy and glad that I can do that until now.
Other than that, just have to hopefully put it in the hole.  I mean, I miss a little short birdie putt, like two of them on the back nine, really, really beautiful, but I'm here, 1-over, I'm happy.
Q. It's one of those things where you kind of can't -- you don't know what you're going to expect this weekend, but what is there for to you work on?  I know I was talking with your caddie earlier and it's kind of just maybe the putting around the greens.  Is that something you want to focus on heading into the weekend?
JASMINE SUWANNAPURA:   Probably the speed of the green because sometime when it's into the wind, it could be slow and with the wind it can go long.  I had a lot of three-putts yesterday, 3-putts on three holes and today, two holes.  That showed that I can hit the green, but just have 3-putts.
So if I could stop making 3-putts, it might be better.
