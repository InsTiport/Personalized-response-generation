Q.   Real quick, just a comment, good week, got to be feeling good, moving on.
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   Yeah.   I mean, it was a good week.   Obviously when you're out there and you have a chance and you play quite well, like I feel like I did today, it's always a little bit disappointing.   But, you know, sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn't.   Just a couple not great breaks on the back-9, 13 and 18.   But other than that, I thought we fought hard and good and just a shame.
