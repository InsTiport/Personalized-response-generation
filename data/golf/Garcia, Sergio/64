 Q.  Nice to finish with a birdie at the end there, but what are your views on the overall round, Sergio?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah.  Obviously, finishing with a birdie, it's the nicest way to finish.  Unfortunately, it doesn't make the round any better.  But I don't know, to be totally honest, I felt like, obviously, I didn't have the best of starts.  I felt like I fought hard, started playing better.  I got a couple iffy bounces, made a couple bogeys, kind of put me a little bit behind the 8 ball.   
Then I was trying to recover, and unfortunately, things just didn't want to drop, simple as that.  But, you know, I guess that's what happens sometimes.  We'll go out tomorrow and try to play well and see what happens.   
 Q.  What happened on the 10th?  Obviously, we've all seen the pictures of you playing out in the burn.  You got a bad bounce to drive in there, did you, or something?  Or what happened?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, the way I hit my driver, I never thought it was going to get to the burn.  I hit -- the wind was down on the right.  So I hit a cut drive.  I never thought I would get it that far.  Obviously, it must have just rolled in.   
You know, it's funny.  I wish I would have got the bounce I got on 9.  On 9 I hit a beautiful drive in the middle of the fairway, and it took a huge hop to the right and went in the rough.  It would have been nice if that happened on 10 instead of on 9.  Unfortunately, it didn't happen on either of them, and I made bogey on both of them.   
It was just one of those days, and I didn't hit a good shot on 12 after hitting a great drive and three-putted.  And I hit a great putt on the next and had a big lip-out.  And then on 14 I pulled it, and it went in -- there was one little bush, and it went right in it.  It's one of those things, I guess.   
 Q.  When it went in the burn, it didn't look like there was a lot of space to play with, but you saw enough to make you think that you could get it out?  
SERGIO GARCIA: No, I did get it out.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
SERGIO GARCIA: I did get it out.  It would have been nice, there was one little rock behind the ball.  If that little rock had not been there, I'm sure I could have got on the green.  Unfortunately, the rock was there.  I was hoping it was going to come out fairly straight, and it came out, obviously, hit -- the ball hit the rock as I hit it with the club, and it came out left, and then it went pretty much in the bunker again.   
I didn't have a stance.  I couldn't get to the flag.  And I ended up making a good 5, I guess.   
 Q.  It's not often you play out of the burn.  
SERGIO GARCIA: I played before, yeah.  I'm sure it won't be the last time.
