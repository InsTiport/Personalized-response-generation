 Q.  Which round did you get the most out of? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Definitely today.  Yesterday I played easier conditions.  I played better yesterday.  I hit a lot of greens, a lot of fairways.  Unfortunately I didn't make a lot of putts yesterday. 
 But today, I felt like I played nicely on the front nine, and after the tee shot on 8, it kind of went a little bit south.  I had a bit of trouble with some pulled shots.  But then I recovered nicely.  I had a couple nice recoveries, and I managed to finish on the red numbers, even though today with the conditions soft it was quite windy. 

 Q.  When you tee off and you see Rocco Mediate got to 9-under par already, with the conditions changing like you stated, can you take an aggressive mind-set to that first tee on this course under these conditions? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, what you think about is that it can be done.  For quite a while I thought that I was probably going to be around that number.  Unfortunately it just got quite tough toward the end.  These holes coming in were playing difficult and some good pin positions.  I'm happy with it.  I would love to be a couple better, but you know, it's not a bad round. 

 Q.  1-under, halfway home. 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, fortunately I had it going for a little bit.  Got it to 7 and felt like I was playing quite well under the conditions.  Then I struggled a little bit with my 3-putt on 11.  You know, that's the way it is.  And this course was not playing easy at all today.  You can see it in the scores this afternoon.  I still managed to shoot under par which is not a bad round. 

 Q.  With the wind whipping around and the rough as it is, is this a place where you have to really pick your moments to attack? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  More than anything, if you drive the ball well, the greens are still soft, so you can pretty much attack pretty nicely. 
 But if you start missing fairways, it's going to be a bit of a struggle because you need to get really lucky with your lies in the rough.  You know, if not, it's going to be a lot of up-and-downs for pars. 

 Q.  It's supposed to get cool and the wind is still around; is that something would you like to see on the weekend, tough, difficult conditions? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, definitely, I've always enjoyed playing if the wind.  I've always felt like I can get most out of my game there.  So you know, it will be nice to see it blowing a little bit like it did today and we'll see what happens. 

 Q.  (About the rough this week compared to course setup in a major). 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Maybe a little bit.  It's similar setup.  Probably fairways in the majors will be a little bit narrower. 
 Yeah, but it has some similarities. 

 Q.  How encouraging is it when you see Paul case's name up there and more and more weeks Europeans are up there with some consistency? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, it's great.  It's great to see Europeans up there, and, you know, friends of yours.  It's definitely nice to see it.  But at the end of the day, I want to do the things I can do. 

 Q.  Speaking of friend of yours, a lot of Lake Nona guys, a lot of Isleworth guys, how is it playing close to home with all of these guys? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  It's great.  Any time you can go back and sleep in your own bed and be around your hone house, even though you don't spend much time in it, it's always nice.  It always gives you that kind of home feeling. 

 Q.  Sort of a mini Tavistock Cup here today, of course Tiger plays for Isleworth, you for Lake Nona, how do you feel the two places did today? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, I don't know.  I'm not worried about that.  I'm worried about trying to be in this tournament and give myself a chance to win Sunday. 

 Q.  How does your game feel overall? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  It feels pretty good.  Yeah, it feels pretty good.  I feel like I'm getting better every week.  I've just got to keep working hard and hopefully keep it on the right track.
