Q. Great finish.  How do you get a ball to spin like you did on 17?SERGIO GARCIA: Just hit the pin (laughing).  No, it was obviously very lucky.  I guess the good thing was the ball was going straight at it.  But it just came out a little bit hotter than I thought.  I obviously didn't want it to be too far short because it's not an easy shot from the front of the green with the wind and the way the pin was.  But for me, the nice thing was to be able to make the putt after the good break and make a great birdie there on 17, definitely stole one, and then finish with another nice birdie on 18, so I'm very happy with that, and looking forward to -- I was going to say the weekend, but Sunday and Monday.Q. How do you feel about your position in the tournament?  Do you feel you're right back in there?SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I feel like I'm in a decent spot.  Obviously I would love to be a little bit higher, but I think that we fought well the first two days.  Yesterday I didn't feel amazing, and I managed to keep it fairly good with the windy conditions, and I finished it off well today.  I'm very satisfied about that.
