Q.  The back nine, is there anything much different to your game? 

SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I birdied 12.  I eagled 11. 

Really, it wasn't, the main thing was that I just was able to hit it a bit closer to the pin on the back nine.  I hit a lot of good shots on the front.  I mean, I hit a good shot on the first but I flew the green.  I had hit too much club.  On 2, I hit another great shot with a 6-iron and hit about four yards right of the pin, so it was a good birdie, didn't chip it in. 

Then on 5, I hit another good shot and it came up just a bit short. 

7, unfortunately I was blocked by the tree on the right, just missing the fairway. 

8, I had a good opportunity but hit it a little bit, probably about 16 feet and didn't make it. 

Then on 9, I hit a really good shot.  I hit it to about, I don't know, eight feet, nine feet and didn't make that putt. 

Then on the back nine, I was able to hit a couple close ones and make them and that was the main difference. It was pretty consistent.  I'm pretty happy the way I hit the ball with all of the wind and everything. 


Q.  We asked Jose Maria about 17 and he said you're never really happy until it's over; do you agree with that about the hole? 

SERGIO GARCIA:   Yes, well, it's a hole that you know it's going to get your adrenaline going.  You have to be so precise with every single shot you hit.  You have to hit a good drive because the landing area is not big.  Then you have to hit a great lay-up.  You have two options:  You can hit is short of the bunker or over the bunker, but over the bunker makes it a little easier.  The problem is, you hit over the bunker, you know you have to be a bit careful with the spin.  With the greens as soft as they are, you have to be really careful  with that. 

Definitely, a five is always a good result.  I felt like the three shots I hit, I probably deserved a bit more but any time you get out of there with a five or lower, you're happy.

It was a fairly easy pin today, anyway.
