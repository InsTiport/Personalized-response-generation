  Q. Just comment. First one on TOUR, I believe?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, first one in competition, ever, as an amateur or professional. I mean, I've had, I think, like seven of them, but always practice rounds and things like that. That was very exciting for me. I've been very close many times, but you don't expect it to make it all the way from 205 yards, so that was nice.  
  
  Q. Jump start the round in any way?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it definitely did. After that I started going pretty good, and unfortunately I just lost a little bit coming in. I hit a couple bad shots and just happy the round is over and looking forward to this afternoon.  
  
  Q. It was a 5-iron, right?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: 5-iron.
