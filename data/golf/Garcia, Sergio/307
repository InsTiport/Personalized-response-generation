Q.   14‑under par for the week, not a bad one. 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It was a good week.   Obviously second round kind of put me a little bit behind the 8‑ball.   The other three rounds were pretty good.   Just, you know, a little disappointed with my second shot on 18 today.   But at least we managed to make that putt for bogey, which makes it taste a little sweeter. 

Q.   There's no such thing, really, as a good 5 on a par 4 but it's nice to see‑‑ it doesn't really matter what you make.   You make a nice putt like that to end the week, I really like the fist pump there. 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, after the second shot‑‑ it was a good 5.   But yeah, I mean, it's a tough hole.   You've got wind into off the left and there's not that much room to miss it.   And you know, I want to still try to hit the proper shot. 
I don't want to just blast it in the right bunker and hope for the best.   I'm still trying to hit the right shot and I kind of quit a little bit on it and just right hand took over and unfortunately hit in the water. 
But you know, like you said, it was a good week, and I can't be disappointed with that.

Q.   I've got to tell you, the way the field played that hole today, I'm sure you didn't make the scoring average too much higher than it was today.   Out of the first 11 guys, eight guys hit it in the water and at one point the stroke average was almost 6 today?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It's playing tough today.   It's quite breezy.   The wind is hurting more than it was yesterday, so if you don't catch it absolutely perfect, which I did, and I probably carried by two feet, you know, you don't carry that right corner of the water. 
And the problem is that once you hit a good drive, you think it's over, and you have to hit the second shot, which is not that easy either.   But I played it fairly well for the week I would say.   I think I made one birdie and one bogey and two pars.   So I can't be disappointed with that. 

Q.   Well where are we going to see you leading up to the Masters in the next few weeks? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I'm playing the next two, Tampa and Orlando, and then I'll have two weeks off and kind of get ready for the Masters.

Q.   At this golf course even if it's windy like this, you know the guys are going to score well.
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Overall, I'm pretty happy.   Not happy with the second shot I hit on 18 but I'm happy with the up‑and‑down which made it a little better. 

Q.   And how are you going to get prepared for the Masters? 
SERGIO GARCÃA: Well, going to play the next two weeks.   I'm going to play Tampa and Orlando and then have a couple of weeks off and then hopefully be ready for it.   It's obviously the first major of the year, we always don't know what to expect but hopefully my game will be on form there and I'll be able to play well.
