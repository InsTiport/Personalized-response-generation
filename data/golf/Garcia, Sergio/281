 Q.   What do you expect this weekend to be like just generally?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I don't know, depends, because the course is going to slowly get a little bit firmer if it doesn't rain anymore.   I think with the wind we had today, if it keeps going like that‑‑ I mean, the greens got a lot faster than yesterday.   
So the course will get faster as the week goes on if it doesn't rain, and it will get more difficult.   Even though there's not much rough, there's a lot of danger out there on all those tee shots and you have to be careful with where you position your ball.   
   
 Q.   Is this case that you have to get your work done today and this afternoon to put yourself in position for the weekend?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, it wasn't easy, though.   The only good thing about it was that the course was still soft from yesterday's rain, but it was quite windy.   So it was difficult to hit it close to some of the pins.   Some of the pins were quite tucked, but I was able to hit two or three shots that were very, very close, some good birdie opportunities.   I rolled a couple really good putts, and obviously the long bomb on 6 for eagle.   
But it's nice to be able to play 30 holes and play them fairly well and get myself in a good situation for the weekend.   
   
 Q.   What time did you get to the course yesterday?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yesterday, well, yesterday at 1:30, it got to the point where I couldn't stay in the room anymore.   You know, I did a little bit of bike and I just couldn't really stay anymore, so I came here and I just waited it out until we got to tee off at 5:40.   
So it was a long day, not easy.   I would rather have a day like today, I would rather play too much than too little, because at least you get in a rhythm.   When you've been waiting all day and you only play like five or six holes at six in the afternoon, you feel like the whole day has gone and you've pretty much done nothing.  
   
 Q.   So you would rather have a day like today‑‑  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I would say so, because of today, but yesterday wasn't nice, it was a lot of waiting for us, too.   We weren't starting, stopping, but there was a lot of waiting and not knowing if you were teeing off at 2:00 or 4:00 or 5:00 or 6:00.   But other than that, it was fine, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Do you have a chance in between shots to look up at the Statue of Liberty?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   To tell you the truth, not really.   You're so‑‑ you know, when you get quite a windy day like it was today, it's not easy.   So I don't think you have a lot of time to enjoy the views, even though the views are great.   So at least we get to enjoy them on Tuesday and Wednesday.
