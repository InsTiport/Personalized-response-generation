 Q.  (Inaudible).
SERGIO GARCIA:  I 'd say they were the fastest and
firmest links greens I've played, for sure.  They were so firm
that it wasn't really much friction on the ball, between the ball
and the grass.  And some of the putts were extremely quick.  I
think we got lucky that the wind didn't blow too hard, because if
it would have blown a little harder, the ball I think would have
definitely moved on the greens.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:  We played them, so I guess they're fair.
Q.  Some of the players coming in before you
said (inaudible).
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, but I think what will be unfair is
for the guys that are in the afternoon tomorrow to play them soft
when we've played them like this.  That would be unfair, I think.
Q.  You're not the first person to say that as well.  Do you
think they'll water tonight?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I think coming Saturday, then, it's a
different story.  Then if you do that -- we've had -- if we don't
obviously get any rain, then you're favoring in the guys that
played in the morning, I think.
Q.  Are you still in the hunt?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Am I still in the hunt?  I would love to
finish 1- or 2-over, which I think I could have done today and I
think that would have been a pretty good score this afternoon.
Unfortunately just a couple of bogeys coming in didn't help very
much.
