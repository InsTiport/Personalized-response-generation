  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Thanks for joining us and welcome back to the BMW International Open.   How was your journey over?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It was good.   Obviously a little bit tired with jet‑lag and everything.   But today didn't help very much.   The Pro‑Am we played with rain and everything.   But other than, that it's fine.   You know, always looking forward to playing the BMW International Open here in Germany where I've been fortunate enough to do really well.   So hopefully we can have a decent week.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Nice to play a golf course where you can make a birdie?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, yeah (laughing).   Funny enough.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   It does change, doesn't it.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It is.   We were making birdies today but it didn't feel that great after last week, with how hard it was last week, and today with the rain and how uncomfortable it was out there, it wasn't great.   
   
 Q.   Does the football make you feel better?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, Spain doesn't play until early.   
   
 Q.   But you must have fantasies; I think you are a fan of soccer?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Of course I am.   Are you not?   Are you not a fan of Germany?   
   
 Q.   Martin Kaymer told us two hours ago that there is a big question among golf pros, talking about football, and especially Germany versus Spain, which could collide in the final.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, it could happen.   I think Spain needs to start playing a little bit better than they have.   The first three games, or at least the first and third game.   
But obviously it's a possibility.   There's still some really good teams out there, and in 90 minutes, any of the teams can lose.   Obviously Germany is looking good.   Spain had a good team but they need to improve a little bit better.   You know, Portugal is looking pretty good.   Italy, I think Italy can go quite far.   
So we'll see, when you get to World Cups and you get to the quarterfinals and things like that, it gets very, very interesting.   
   
 Q.   You won your second event in 1999; how special is it to come back to such a special place in your career?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It's nice, but at the same time, I think I only remember two or three holes on the golf course.   So it's been a long time since I've come back to Cologne.   Yeah, it's always nice to come back to a place where you've done well and hopefully we'll be able to do well again.   
   
 Q.   (How much does the U.S. Open take out of you)?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It does quite a bit, there's no doubt about it.   We all know how hard the U.S. Open is, and especially because it played exactly like the USGA wanted it to play, fast and firm.   Obviously if your game wasn't 100 per cent on, you were going to struggle.  
So you could see that in most of us, and you know, it takes quite a bit out.   But we'll try to get through this week, and then we have three weeks off, which will be nice.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about your career, where you see yourself now, and where you see yourself in one, two, three, four, five years and what are your ambitions?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, right now, I feel like I've been fortunate enough to have a fairly successful career.   Obviously some tournaments here and there that I probably feel that I should have won and maybe didn't, but overall, I think it's been good.   Four or five years from now, I don't know.   I would love to be able to tell you I could see the future, but so many things can happen.   
So hopefully good things will happen for me.   You know, hopefully injuries and things like that respect me and see if I can kind of keep playing the game as well as possible.  
   
 Q.   How much does it bother you that you should have been the guy with a few major victories and now there are some Webb Simpsons and Bubba Watsons that sneak from behind and they have major titles now?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, they are obviously better than me I guess.   
   
 Q.   Well, have you finished the subject, or do you still feel a major title in your‑‑  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   We'll see.   Like I say, I can't see the future.   I go to the majors.   I try to play the best I can and I try to give myself a chance at winning them.   It has not happened yet.   Hopefully it will.   
But I would love to tell you it's going to happen, when it's going to happen.   But unfortunately I don't have a crystal ball that can tell me.   
   
 Q.   You're still a happy man without a major title?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, obviously if I don't have it, what can I do?   I'm not going to take my life because I don't win a major.   Fortunately I have a lot of other things that maybe some of those guys don't have‑‑ well, many things, many friends, many other hobbies that make me happy.   So, you know, some guys need it, some guys don't.   
   
 Q.   Looking back to last year, we talked yesterday night and it was special for you; you needed five extra holes with your friend, Pablo.   What are your memories?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It was great.   Last year was very nice for many reasons.   Not only because I almost won the tournament, but it gave me the possibility to gain a lot of World Ranking points, to get into the British Open, which is my favourite tournament of the year; to kind of get my year started and kind of get going.   It gave me a lot of confidence going into the summer.   
That obviously helped me get my couple of wins towards the end of the summer.   It was a great week, and hopefully I will be able to do something similar this week.   Obviously I don't feel like the last probably four or five days haven't been great, the way I've felt about my game, but hopefully I'll be able to find something tomorrow and see if at the end of the day we can survive and hopefully we'll be able to do that.   
   
 Q.   (What's your experience at Lytham)?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, I've had the experience of playing twice there, once as an amateur and once as a professional.   There's obviously a lot of things that come to mind.   '96, I played practise rounds with Seve, which was amazing as a 16‑year‑old playing my first British Open and my first major.   
Well, I played really well that year.   Unfortunately I didn't make the cut.   But 2001, obviously we finished Top‑10, which was nice.   There's obviously one bad memory about it, the accident that Carlos had that week.   But other than that, like I've always said, I love the British Open.   I love the people that come to watch the British Open.   I love the golf courses and the challenges that it provides you.   That's why it's my favourite tournament.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Sergio, thanks for joining us.
