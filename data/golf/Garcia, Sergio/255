Q.   Sergio, first of all, what happened on the 7th green, and why you were offering the half, and did you regret it later on when it got tight?
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, not at all.   I don't regret it at all.   He played much better than me on the last ten holes and he deserves a win.
This is a gentleman's game, and lately it hasn't felt like it's been like that.   This is the way I was brought up by my dad, you know, playing golf.
I felt like my drop on 6 took too much time.   And then I was playing as hard as I could to try and beat him.   I made a birdie on 8 and got to 3â€‘up.   Then he got going and I wasn't able to keep up.
