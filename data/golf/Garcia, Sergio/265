Q.   Thoughts after two days? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I'm obviously very happy.   I played okay yesterday.   Probably a little bit better today.   Started nicely.   Made a couple birdies.   Missed a couple good chances.   But then I got a couple good saves when I missed a couple shots on the back nine, and I was able to finish nicely. 
Just a little bit disappointed on 16 after hitting such a great tee shot and hit it on the green and to 3‑putt.   But other than that, it was nice, a great up‑and‑down on the last.   I'm very happy with it.

Q.   I take it there are plenty of opportunities; you're in tune with your game? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, you have to play well.   It's a challenging course, and we were fortunate on Wednesday night when it rained because as firm as these greens were getting, it was going to be very, very difficult to score on this golf course.
But any time you come back to a venue and a course where you've won, obviously brings you great memories.   So that's always very nice.   Hopefully we can do something similar. 

Q.   Does it aid the confidence, the knowledge that you've done well on it before, that sort of gives you an extra strike, if you like?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   To tell you the truth, I don't think so.   I think that the confidence only gives it that week and how you're feeling that week.   If you're swinging well, you'll have confidence; if you're not swinging well, you'll struggle a little bit.
It is a nice feeling, but it just depends on your ability that week.
