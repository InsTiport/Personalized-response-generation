 SERGIO GARCIA:   Those kind of putts, those 6-, 7-footers you need to make, and when it gets a little bumpy and you start losing confidence, it just makes it tough.  But you know, I just wasn't fortunate enough to get the right bounce on the green.

Q.  Tough holes out there? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   After I hit a great shot, I made a great putt on 12 to stay 2-up; and then 13, I didn't hit it too good and won that hole.
And then on 14, it looked like I had a good chance of making the 28-footer for par and the momentum swings a lot.  But a good putt on 15, it just broke a little too much.  Didn't hit a very good putt on 17 and couldn't close it on 18.
On 18, the ball just hooked, it looked like three yards from the putter.  It's one of those things, poa annua greens, when they are not smooth like they were last week, sometimes there's a little hole you don't notice and the ball starts to move.  But that's the way it goes. 

Q.  What are your plans now?
SERGIO GARCIA:  And take a couple of days off and get ready for Doral. 

Q.  How much do you plan to play in Florida? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Doral and then Bay Hill and TPC. 
Played good until, probably the 14th hole, maybe 13 after hitting that loose shot with the sand wedge.  But I think I played the best today and felt like I was hitting the ball better, but I wasn't making putts, and you have to.  In match-play, you have to because that's what keeps the momentum going and that's when it can change the momentum.  If he has a 6-footer and I have a 10-footer and I make the 10-footer, the 6-footer all of a sudden is like 50.  I wasn't able to do that and he was. 

Q.  Do you like this tournament?  Is there anything you would do to change this format?
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, I think it's great.  If the greens would have been just a little better, it would have been great.  

Q.  Do you think coming back here for next three years, does that excite you? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I think the course is a good course.  You know, hopefully, we can catch good weather like it's been the last four or five days and get the course a little firmer.  The firmer the greens are, the better they are going to be.  When they are a little soft like they have been this week, it's a little tougher.
