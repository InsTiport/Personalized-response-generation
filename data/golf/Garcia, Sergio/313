 Q.   Sergio, very good day for you today.   I enjoyed following you.   How would you classify your play today at 69?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I obviously played better than yesterday.   I made three stupid bogeys, but for the most part it was good.   
I had a good finish, which always helps.   We'll see what we can do on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   The last 21 holes have been great.   That shot you hit yesterday at the parâ€‘5 16, did it kind of spark you today?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, I wouldn't say it sparked me.   I'm kind of running almost on empty.   I'm looking forward to going home and relaxing for a couple weeks before The Masters.   But I'll just try to hopefully keep doing some of the good things we did today and see if we can put out two good scores and see where that ends up.   
But the way I was feeling to be able to make the cut this week, it was already an achievement.  
   
 Q.   It's been a good start to the year for you.   Are you excited about where the game is heading into your first major?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I guess the results have been pretty good.   I think that the game could be better, there is no doubt.   But, overall, I guess I can't be too disappointed with it.  
   
 Q.   Solid day keep it going.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   What is your energy level?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   It's not the highest at the moment this week.  
   
 Q.   Why?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   I just want to go home get some rest.   Simple as that.
