 Q.   You got back to 3‑over par.   How were you able to do that today?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know, I guess I got a little fortunate, I made a couple birdies and then a nice eagle on 2.   And I was able to birdie a couple of those shorter holes coming in.   
   
 Q.   The eagle here at No. 2.   How good was that?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   It was good because I was 6‑over at that time.   I hit a really good drive and then a very nice 3‑wood to that distance and I was able to roll that in, which is a really nice that I made a great save on the next, so that was good.  
   
 Q.   Over the course of the 18 holes, how was the reception from the fans here?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   It was good.   I think that it was very good for the most part, and I was happy with it.
