Q.   Good start?   Missed opportunity?   How do you assess it? 
    SERGIO GARCIA:   I think overall, it was good.   It was a decent start for being first tournament and first round of the season, obviously a little bit nervy and don't know exactly what to expect. 
    But no, overall, I think it was good.   Obviously the greens are very tough to make putts on them, so not only me, but also Paul and Ernie, we hit some good putts that didn't want to go in but overall, I think 69 is not a bad round to start with. 

Q.   Quite nice to get those little sudden nervy, first tournament feelings again?
    SERGIO GARCIA:   Oh, definitely, at the beginning, it's always interesting to see how you feel and see how the swing is working and stuff, so it's nice, but hopefully we'll get better as the week goes on and have a chance on Sunday.

Q.   And the clothes? 
    SERGIO GARCIA:   It's going to be very yellowâ€‘ish all week.   It's just the launch of the shoes and the launching, the new adidas adizero shoes with the yellow colour.   It's going to be a good amount of yellow this week going on, so it's nice, I like yellow, so it's good.
