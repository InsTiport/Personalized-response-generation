Q.   How deep have you had to dig to shoot 1‑under? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, it wasn't the most comfortable week, that's for sure.   The conditions did not help very much the first couple of days.   I guess quite happy with the result.   It wasn't easy but we managed to shoot a decent number.

Q.   Talk about the reaction that you've had from the players and the crowd; as you walked across the bridge, everyone was cheering for you. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   It's been amazing.   Yesterday the walk up on the first tee was unbelievable.   Like I said yesterday, I've been very fortunate throughout my career with the way the crowds have treated me, not only here in the U.K. and Europe, but all over the world.   You know, to get that kind of reaction yesterday; and also from my fellow players, it was great. 

Q.   And I know you've been trying to get a hold of Tiger to apologise to him, any news on that yet? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, we have talked to his manager, but we'll try a couple more times.   If not, I'll definitely see him at the U.S. Open and I'll talk to him face‑to‑face.

Q.   A quick question about the golf:   How difficult is it out there today?
SERGIO GARCIA:   It's quite tough.   It's very, very cold.   It's quite windy.   Obviously with the rain it doesn't help.   So the ball is just going nowhere.   You have to be very patient.   Obviously making a lot of pars is always a good thing, and we managed to do that today.
