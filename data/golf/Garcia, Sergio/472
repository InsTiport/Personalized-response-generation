 Q. Off to a good start, 4-under, just a few comments about the round. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I scored nicely. Obviously I didn't hit the ball as well as I've been hitting it lately. But I managed to score well, and that's the important thing. Hopefully I can get it sorted out. If this is my worst ball-striking round, then we'll be in good shape. 
 Conditions were good, too, to be able to score out there. The greens were soft and there was pretty much no wind. So if you were on, you could shoot a really good round.

 Q. What did you feel best about in terms of your game?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Obviously lately I've been feeling good with pretty much every part of my game. Today I started a little bit driving the ball, hit a couple wayward tee shots here and there, but I got away with them, and I managed to recover nicely. Obviously my short game is still in good shape, so that's good.
