   SERGIO GARCÃA: It's been a good day. I played well, similar to how I played yesterday afternoon.   
 I could have holed a more putts here and there, but it's been fine. It's a pity that it didn't happen yesterday.   
 I'm going to China with very good feelings. The public has been fantastic. Here in Spain I always feel they treat me very well, and I am feeling a bit frustrated for not giving them a spectacle for the weekend.   
 The new Volvo World Match Play format I think is very good, because you have to think a lot. For example, the match that we had in front, Anthony Kim was the winner of the group, because he won the last hole, which means that this format keeps the intrigue until the end. And it makes us keep concentrating until the last hole.
