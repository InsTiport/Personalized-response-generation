 Q.   Sergio, you're golfing royalty, but I understand at the Proâ€‘Am you played with the queen.  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it was great.   Great experience.   She played quite nicely, and you know, we had a great time.  
I didn't know what to expect, you know, when it comes down to royalty and stuff like that, but she was very, very relax, very chill.   Had a great time.   She was quite funny, making jokes and things like that.   So it was a good experience.  
   
 Q.   So she inspired you to a really fast start today.  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I guess she did.   She kept saying those things yesterday.   You know, when I hit a shot, she said, "oh, tomorrow you'll hit it over there.   Don't worry."   So I guess she knew something that I didn't know.  
   
 Q.   Well, you know, we always think of you as someone who drives the ball a long way and straight and that's what you need around this golf course.   So it obviously suits you.  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   I think it's the kind of golf course.   It's quite narrow.   Not the longest, but you have to drive the ball well.   I think I managed to do that fairly well for the most part today.   My irons were quite good.   
I would have loved to make a couple more putts, but I hit some good putts that unfortunately didn't go in.   But the greens are not very ease to read.  
   
 Q.   Right.   But now you got a lot of confidence for the next three rounds.  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it's good.   When you start like this it's always nice, gives you a little extra confidence, so hopefully we'll be able to do more of the same.  
   
 Q.   Hopefully I'll be talking to you for the next three days.   Best of luck.
