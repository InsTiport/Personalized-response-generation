Q.   Overcast, not too much wind and scoring has been far more difficult today than it was yesterday. 
Any reason for that?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I guess I would say probably couple of pins little bit tougher here and there.   For me, mainly it was the putter.   I just wasn't -- I had -- I didn't play as good as yesterday. 
Don't get me wrong, but I wasn't able to hole it as well as yesterday from four, five, six feet.   Unfortunately missed four, five putts inside that distance and, you know, they get tricky when you start having five, six footers down the hill on these greens as fast as they are.   It's tricky to get it going on the right line and make sure you hole it.

Q.   I don't think anybody is going to get to 18 or 19-under this year.   5-under par seems like a pretty good start for the first 36 holes.
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   Well, I would have loved to shoot at least a couple under today.   That would have been nice.   I probably feel like I played well enough to do it but I didn't.   So, you know, going to have to have a good weekend and see what happens.
