Q. Talk about last night. Your first time not having to host. Were you able to be a little more relaxed in there?
SERGIO GARCIA: I mean, yeah, I mean obviously you didn't have to worry about if anyone liked the menu or anything like that, but, yeah, and it was a great dinner. We had a lot of fun, some great stories, and it was very relaxed and very easygoing. 

Q. Did you give Patrick any advice leading up to the dinner?
