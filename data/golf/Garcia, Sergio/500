  Q. What did you think of your round overall?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I'm a little disappointed with the last hole. I thought anything around par today was a great score this afternoon. Nine course was playing tough, and the pins were tougher. Very difficult. Even the hitting good shots to some of the greens. But, you know, we just got a little fooled right with the wind on the last hole. We thought it was down to the left, and it actually turned from the right. So that's how it was. I just got to keep my head up.   
  
  Q. That stretch of 3, 4, and 5?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: I was trying before 2. That's what I'm telling you. It's so windy. I mean, the wind is changing constantly. So it's not like it's blowing from the same direction all the time and, you know, do a good shot on 4 and got the wrong club and the wrong wind and over the green dead. Then on the par 5, the same. I felt like I hit the ball pretty nicely. I hit a lot of good shots. I hit a lot of good putts. Couple went in. Not a lot of them, but, you know, I'm not disappointed.  
  
  Q. What about this weekend?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: I'm looking forward to it. Like I said, it's not going to get any easier. Pins are going to be tough, and if the wind is blowing, this course is going to be playing very difficult. Got to hold my head up there and make sure I have a chance on Sunday.  
  
  Q. How about the score tomorrow, low?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: We'll see. It depends on the conditions.
