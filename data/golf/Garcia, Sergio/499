  Q. Talk about the closing round today, nice finish for you?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was a great round. I knew to do something, something really good to have a chance. I still think it's probably going to be just short. At least I gave myself a possibility. I put myself in a position that on the back-9, I made some good putts coming in and, you know, unfortunately probably going to be short, but a good week overall.  
  
  Q. What do you do while you wait around?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Go back to the clubhouse and watch a little bit of the Euro Cup. Round one is over.  
  
  Q. Talk about the week, getting you ready for what's to come next week. Do you think this course prepared you?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: It definitely prepared me on the competitive side. I guess it's a little different, the greens were quite quick. That's something we're going to see next week. The grass is different so -- I think overall it was a good week to play before the Open.  
  
  Q. Sergio, slick greens out here again, putted well, obviously. You've got to have some confidence.  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Got to be something about the TPC courses. No. I felt like unfortunately yesterday I didn't hit the ball the way I've been hitting it, and I managed to shoot a good 1-over par. Today I hit the ball a little better and holed some beautiful putts. You know, at least I tried hard, and I gave myself a chance.  
  
  Q. Not burned out, are you?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No. I'll be fine. I'll take a bit of a rest the next couple of days and make sure that, you know, my energy level is all the way on the top for the U.S. Open.
