Q.   Splendid round of 66, how pleasing is it to play that well in just your second competitive round of the year?
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   It was nice.   I definitely feel like I played a little bit better than yesterday.   Hit a good amount of good shots.   Overall it was good.   I gave myself a lot of good chances for birdies.   Hit some good putts that didn't go and then made some nice ones, too.   So overall, can't be disappointed.

Q.   Quite breezy this afternoon, how differently did the golf course play to yesterday morning when you played in flat calm conditions?
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, yesterday was an absolute perfect day.   Today looked like it was going to be the same and the wind kind of started picking up a wind.   It wasn't the wind what we are used to seeing here but it made it tough enough to choose some of the right clubs and it made some tee shots a little bit tougher, so you know, we tried to play smart and well and managed to do that fairly nicely.

Q.   You are renowned for your shot‑making skills; how much do you enjoy those sort of conditions where you have to manufacture shots?
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   I do.   I do.   When I feel good, I love to hit all sort of shots, draws, fades, high, low, things like that.   I'm just hoping that I can be able to keep doing it throughout the weekend here and hopefully we'll be up there on Sunday.

Q.   You were out there with Paul Lawrie, didn't work out for him any Ryder Cup chat, reminiscing in the early part of the round?
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   We did talk a couple things here and there, a couple funny comments from that week and stuff, where we talk about obviously Paul McGinley getting the captaincy and stuff.   Yeah, it was nice, a little bit disappointing that he finished the way he finished and hopefully he'll do better next year.

Q.   Your thoughts on Paul McGinley being announced as the captain? 
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   It's great.   Obviously my personal choices were either McGinley or Darren.   Obviously Darren didn't want to do it yet, so for me, it's perfect. 

Q.   How do you feel about your position in the championship now? 
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   There's a lot of good players out there.   I think that it was nice to shoot a good round today and put myself in a position, because I was a little bit far, a little bit behind yesterday, so today I was able to do that, and you know, hopefully I'll be able to play well again on the weekend and see where we finish. 
    It was nice, I obviously played a little bit better than yesterday.   I gave myself some good birdie chances throughout the day and was able to hole some.   So very happy with it, good round.   It was a little bit tougher today with a little bit more breeze in the afternoon, the greens got a little crunchier, but happy with it. 

Q.   Do you relish the fact that the wind picked up, as well? 
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   It wasn't a lot of wind but it definitely made a difference from yesterday.   It made it a little tougher.   But we were able to play fairly well in those conditions, and you know, very happy with the actual round.

Q.   I know you're aiming for the top every single time you play, but given your pedigree here at this tournament, is this one of those that in the list of wonderful tournaments around the world, you want to get your hands on that Mother of Pearl Trophy?
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   You want to get your hands on all of them.   But there's no doubt that I always, more most of the times, I start my year here, so that only tells you and shows you how much I enjoy it here and how much I like it.   It would be nice to be able to get a win, but you know, to at least kind of get a feel for it and get a feel for the year and the season and stuff and shoot some good rounds to start with, it's already nice.
