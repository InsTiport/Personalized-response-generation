 Q.   Assess the day as a whole and being 6‑under par.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Definitely I think it was actually a good thing for us that the wind didn't pick up as much as maybe it was in the practice rounds, because as firm as those greens were getting, and as fast as they were getting, it would have been quite tricky out there.   But conditions were pretty good.   
A little breeze here and there, but not too bad.   And if you played well, you could score.   But at the same time, if you didn't play too good and you missed a good amount of fairways, then it was tough to hole some of these greens.   
   
 Q.   Do you have a number in mind when you start in terms of where you attack and maybe where you lay back?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Not really.   I think that depends how you feel.   Obviously there's holes where you feel more comfortable than others and where you feel like you can be a bit more aggressive.   There are some others that you don't feel quite as comfortable, so you kind of push it back a little bit.   
But it all depends on conditions.   One hole today playing easy; tomorrow, the wind changes and it can play really, really tough.   So you just have to play it how it comes.   
   
 Q.   You've played here a lot of times.   Is this about as docile or easy as it can get?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, not at all.   I think we've played it here where it's been easier than this, and where the greens were softer and not as fast, and even missing the fairways, you could attack some of these pins.   
Obviously today, the way they were, even though the greens were firm, if you drove the ball well, you could score.   But if you missed a lot of fairways, you could easily shoot even par or 1‑ or 2‑over and that puts you quite a bit back.   
   
 Q.   Which holes were playing more difficult than usual and which were playing easy?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   18 was playing easy, downwind.   You could carry the water for the most part I guess, and it was only a wedge or a 9‑iron in so that's a big difference.   
I think that holes like, I don't know, 10 was playing tricky, because it was into and off the left, not very comfortable.   Then I think 13, they put the tees up, but into the wind, it was still playing fairly long.   I think 14 was playing tough into the wind.  
There wasn't a lot of wind, but you can still manage to get through.   
   
 Q.   You had expressed frustration last year at Augusta, your major fortunes and stuff like that.   But you've won in Greensboro since and you've been playing great golf since the end of last summer.   Has your outlook changed about your prospects down the road, and just how well you're playing?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, I'm worried about what I'm going to do here this week.   You know, that's hard enough.   And that's where I want to try to do well here.   I've had good round here, but unfortunately I haven't had a great tournament yet, so hopefully I can do that before they tear the course up.   And then I'll go to next week in Tampa and try to play well there.   
When the Masters comes, I'll try to figure that one out.   But you don't want to start thinking about the Masters when you are still five weeks away.   
   
 Q.   Your form now, is it as good as it was at any point in your career, the way you're playing and as consistently well as you're playing?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, I wouldn't say so.   I think 2008 was definitely the best I've played in my career, the way I felt hitting the ball and putting and chipping.   Obviously I feel quite good now, not great, but I'm starting to feel a little bit better and hopefully I can ride that good momentum.
