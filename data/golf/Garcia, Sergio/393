 Q. Sergio, let's get rid of the nasty stuff first. 17, what happened from your point of view? Didn't look like you did a lot wrong?
 SERGIO GARCÃA: No, I think it's unfortunate. I guess you're fighting all day, I felt like I was doing pretty good in the conditions. And hit a great shot on 17, I think it was just right of the pin and expecting the ball to be maybe on the green or just around it. Maybe I can get up-and-down for three. Apparently the odds of hitting an eight-inch-wide pond from 340 yards are bigger than I thought. I hit a trunk and then went back in the push and made a good double.

 Q. Positives you can take from the day? You played the front nine beautifully. 
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Yeah, I didn't play the back nine that badly. I hit a couple bad shots, but I was holding it nicely. I was 9-under. I had a couple chances to get to 10, and if you manage to shoot even par or 1-under, even 1-over in these conditions, is a good score and I was on my way. 
 If something different happens on 17, I birdie there and you never know, I might birdie the next, and I'm at 11-under instead of 7. 
 So there's really nothing you can do about that I guess. 

 Q. Thoughts on tomorrow? You're still very much in this. 
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Yeah, that's the good thing. The good thing is that we are still in it. We are only one or maybe two back at the most, and it's a shame, because I could at least have had a one-shot lead. 

 Q. 2-over par for the third round of the tournament, extremely tough playing conditions, tell us how difficult it was. 
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Yeah, I mean, I hit a few good golf shots and the wind was really tough and swirling, and the greens were extremely firm today.
