Q.   You finished at even, 1‑under, what were you doing well today? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   My swing is not feeling very good at the moment, but I guess I made a couple nice putts and managed to make a couple birdies at the right time and was able to salvage some good pars.   Pretty much as simple as that but I didn't feel like I played very well.

Q.   You did a good job hitting the fairways. 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Might have, but didn't feel that good. 

Q.   When you woke up today and saw the rain, did your mind‑set change at all? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, not really.   The course is still there, and you still have to hit good shots obviously.   It makes it a little bit easier if you miss fairways now, because then you might be able to stop it if you get a decent lie from the rough.   Your chips around the greens are usually going to be a little bit easier, but it doesn't really change things.
