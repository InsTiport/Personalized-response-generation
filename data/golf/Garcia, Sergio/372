 Q. Well played today, 69, how hard was it out there?
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was hard. It was just uncomfortable. It was very, very rainy all day long. The course started playing very, very long. So, don't get me wrong, I didn't play my best, that's for sure. 
 But I felt like we hung in there. We finished nicely which is good, two birdies to finish with, and yeah, not too bad in the conditions I guess.

 Q. Are you feeling good about yourself, about your game?
 SERGIO GARCIA: I didn't feel that comfortable today. So I hope that it gets better for tomorrow. It just didn't feel quite that great today. 
 But I hit some good shots, but unfortunately I hit some that I would like to hit again. 

 Q. Because you played so well last week at Congressional, that must have been a big fill-up for you?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yes, that was nice, definitely nice to play nicely at the U.S. Open, get a good finish there. 
 So hopefully we can do the same thing here. Hopefully we can -- you know, there I played very nicely on the first day and then I played okay the next three rounds. Hopefully here today, I played just okay and I can play really nicely the next three. 

 Q. Because I know you would love to play The Open, wouldn't you?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I would love to. That would be great. It's my favourite tournament of the year, so it would be nice if we can get in it. 

 Q. Wouldn't be the same without you. You played with Henrik Stenson today and he certainly produced some great golf in those conditions?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, that was a hell of a round in the afternoon. It was very, very difficult. Very tough. He hit a lot of good shots, he hit a lot of good wedge shots, made some easy birdies, and then you know, the shot on the last was pretty impressive.
