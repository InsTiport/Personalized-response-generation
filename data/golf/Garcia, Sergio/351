Q.   How was it out there today?
SERGIO GARCIA:   It was okay, I guess.   We had a horrendous start.   I managed to shoot 1â€‘under, which under the playing conditions I think it wasn't a bad score.

Q.   We saw the comments you made to the Spanish press yesterday about not thinking that you could ever win a major.   Do you really believe that? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Do you think I lie when I talk? 

Q.   No.   Was it just more emotions after a really bad day?   I think it was the oddest thing I've ever heard an athlete say actually. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Everything I say, I say it because I feel it.   If I didn't mean it, I couldn't stand here and lie like a lot of the guys do.   If I felt like I could win, I would do it. 
Unfortunately at the moment, unless I get really lucky in one of the weeks, I can't really play much better than I played this week and I'm going to finish 13th or 15th. 

Q.   What do you think it is that you are missing? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Everything.
