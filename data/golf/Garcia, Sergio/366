 Q. You had it going for the first 12 holes but then you stumbled?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I think obviously I was feeling very, very good before the break, and then you know came out and I didn't feel quite as good after the break. I hit a couple of wayward shots, but I made a couple of nice saves and kind of kept the round together and then I think three good putts to finish with, with two birdies, but overall I can't be disappointed with it. Obviously if I would have played the last six holes the way I played the first two holes, it could have been a better round. It's not too bad. 

 Q. Have you heard anything about reports about the governor evacuating the coast?
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, I mean, we know what's looking like is happening and stuff. I guess we'll deal with it when it gets here. We don't know if we are going to finish Saturday or Tuesday or Friday next week. (Laughter).
