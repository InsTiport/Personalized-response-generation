  Q. Well played match.  It's always nice to get somewhat of a comfortable lead because some of these other matches might be tight down the line?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   I wouldn't say it was a comfortable win.  Westie, he's a good friend of mine, he's a tough competitor, and he didn't make it easy.  Obviously, you know, I had to make seven birdies to beat him, so obviously had to play hard, had to play well, and make sure that he didn't get too many chances to come back.  Had a couple nice breaks in there and that's what you need.
 Q. Do you feel like this is a Spanish home game for you?  You live in the area now with you and your family.
 SERGIO GARCIA:   When we are here in the United States.  But obviously, yeah, it is fun, it is fun to be around with some of the people we have met here that were able to come and it's a great town, so you know, hopefully they're going to see me for a long time now.
 Q. For you to close it out in 15 holes saves a little bit of momentum and a little bit of energy for the coming days.
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, definitely, definitely the faster you can close it out, the better.  But every match is, it takes a lot out of you, so just got to keep playing that way and keep doing obviously doing well and hopefully get to the weekend and see what we can do.
