 Q. Obviously we all want to know what happened on 15.   
SERGIO GARCIA: I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. It's one of those things. I feel like ‑‑ I don't know, it's the first time in my career where I make a 13 without missing a shot. Simple as that. I felt like I hit a lot of good shots and unfortunately the ball just didn't want to stop. I don't know, you know, it's one of those things. So it's just unfortunate, but that's what it is.   
   
 Q. You played the rest of the round in 1‑over, so do you take something from that or just‑‑  
SERGIO GARCIA: Not really.  
   
 Q. ‑‑ does it seem to linger?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Not really. Obviously I shot 81, which is not great. And, I mean, I was fighting hard, I was doing quite well, obviously had a good possibility on 13 to get back to even and kind of keep my round going after not having a great start and unfortunately we didn't hit the right club there and hit a great shot and left myself no putt. Then I hit a pretty good birdie putt and unfortunately it lipped out. And then the bogey on the next and then obviously the rest is history.   
   
 Q. Can you describe the difficulty of that pin on 15?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Well you saw it. I don't think I need to describe it. It's not the first time it's been there, so it's not new, but with the firmness of the greens and everything, I felt like the ball was going to stop and unfortunately for whatever rebound it didn't want to.  
   
 Q. What did you have in the first time from out there?  
SERGIO GARCIA: I had 206. I had 6‑iron. I thought it was perfect. Straight at the flag. I don't know, if it carries probably two more feet, it's probably good. And if it probably carries a foot less, it probably doesn't go off the green and probably stays on the fringe like Doc's ball did, but unfortunately I flew it on the perfect spot for it to come back. And then I kept hitting good shots with the sand wedge and unfortunately I don't know why, the ball just wouldn't stop.
