 Q.  (Inaudible) playing with Andrew Johnston?  
SERGIO GARCIA: No, it's great.  Any characters in our game are good, and he's obviously a good player, but he's a character.  He's a great guy.  And I had the pleasure -- I met him several times this year, but I met him a little bit and talked to him a little bit more at the Spanish Open when he won, obviously.  And we played together today.  So he's a really nice guy.  He's obviously playing well, so it's good for him.   
 Q.  Did it help you or hurt you at all playing with sort of a crowd the whole time?  
SERGIO GARCIA: No, not at all.  I got my cheers too.  They love me here, so obviously he was pushed hard by the crowds, but so was I.  I've always loved this tournament, and I can't thank the people enough that follow me here and the way they cheered me on.   
 Q.  (Inaudible).  
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, it looks like it, yeah.  Obviously if they manage to finish where they are, it's going to be difficult because the back nine is playing tough.  It's not easy to make birdies the way it was playing today.  I mean, we're hitting good drives and 5 and 4-irons and 3-irons into a lot of the holes.  I mean, I hit 3-iron on 11 and a good drive, 5-iron on 13, 5-iron on 14.  If my ball would have stayed out of the bunker, I would have hit 3-iron on 15 for my second and 4-iron on 17.   
So it's playing tough.  But obviously they're playing very well.  So we'll see.   
 Q.  Going into the final round, how will you go into the final round?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Same way.  If the lead is 1 or 6 or 10, it doesn't matter.  I'm still going to go out there and try to play the best I can, try to shoot a good score and see where that puts me.  Obviously winning is great, but it's not the only thing.  I'd rather finish fifth or third or sixth than 15th or 20th.  So that's what I'm going to try to do.
