  SERGIO GARCIA: Well, why should I be frustrated?  I mean, obviously, yeah, you can always come back and say, oh, I missed a couple here or there, yeah.  But it's not that easy.  It's easy from the bleachers.  But really, the one on 18, I would have loved to make that one.  I felt like -- I hit two great putts on 16 and 17 and they looked like they were going to go in.  They both missed.  And then 18, I actually read it right but I saw Jordan's ball going up the hill and it stayed very straight and I thought if I hit it outside right it was going to miss high, so I hit it a little bit less, and then obviously it did break. But no, I'm not -- I'm still happy.  I didn't feel like I played -- at least my feelings weren't amazing.  I'm not saying that I played badly, but I didn't feel like I was totally smooth and totally on.  To be able to shoot a solid round like I did today, I'm still happy with that.Q. What's your relationship with this championship?SERGIO GARCIA: I love this tournament.  Everybody knows it's -- after the Ryder Cup, it's my favourite tournament.  For so many reasons.  Obviously I've been fortunate to do well on it.  I think -- I mean, I love the courses, the links game.  I really, really enjoy it, and also the people.  I feel like they carry me around the golf course wherever I go.  It doesn't matter if I'm doing well or not so well.  They're always there and cheering, and I can really feel the energy.  You know, it's great.Q. You seemed to have fun out there with Jordan.  Is he the man to beat tomorrow?SERGIO GARCIA: He's one of them for sure.  We did have a good day today.  We both felt -- I think we both felt comfortable with each other out there and played nicely.  But yeah, I don't think he's the only guy to beat.  There's a lot of really, really good players there that are going to be there having a chance tomorrow.Q. Do you see any of the young Sergio in Jordan?SERGIO GARCIA: It's different.  Obviously you can say, yeah, age-wise and stuff, but everybody is different.  I mean, I think he's a little bit more -- probably a little bit more reserved than I was when I was younger.  I'm not saying that he doesn't get excited, but probably I did get a bit more excited, or showed it maybe more.  But obviously he's a wonderful player.
