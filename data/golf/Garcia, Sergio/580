Q.  Just talk about today, 68, pretty good, one off the lead.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, it was a solid day.  Felt like I played well.  I didn't play extremely well, but I drove the ball pretty nicely.  Hit some good iron shots, and then made a couple putts when I had to.  But a bit disappointing with my two bogeys, pretty weak bogeys with the 8 iron, both of them.  You never want to finish with a bogey, but that's the way it goes.

But it was a nice, solid day, as I said before.  The golf course is playing pretty nicely, t there was a bit of wind at the beginning and it kind of died down towards the end and made it play not as tough as it was, but, you know, that's the beauty of this course.  Even without a lot of wind, it still plays quite difficult.
Q.  Just talk about the bogey at the last.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, I pushed it a little bit with my 3 wood, but still was a pretty good tee shot.  Just on the first cut on the right, and had a clear shot just over the trees with the 8 iron.  I tried to draw it in there a little bit and came out of it just a hair.  Hit it in the right bunker and didn't hit a very good bunker shot to about probably ten feet and missed it.  Not many good shots on that hole but that's the way it goes.
