Q.  68 today; Sergio, assess your round.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, I don't know, I guess I felt like I didn't play badly, but it was quite difficult to choose the right clubs.  It was quite windy, I was struggling a lot and the greens were really firm.  I hit a lot of good shots that almost didn't even smell the green, and then I hit some bad ones that I got away with and made some nice pars.

I'm happy with the round.  I think 68 the way the course is playing is a good solid round on this course.
Q.  What's the atmosphere with the players this week coming off a major championship to playing in a tournament that obviously everybody wants to win and has such prestige on the Tour?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I think it's great.  I think that this is a wonderful event, and I think NEC does a great job with getting this event ready for us, and after a tough week like last week, the PGA.  They've done a very good job every year, and the golf course is just a very nice golf course to enjoy.  Hopefully it keeps playing the way it's been playing today.
