SCOTT CROCKETT:  Sergio, thanks for coming in, as always.  A good win today.  Just talk us through the morning.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, definitely good to get through the first round and get some play today after all the rain we had.  The course is a bit wet, but it's hanging in there.  And I started very well.  I hit a lot of good shots, pretty much all day long.  I made a couple of nice putts and I got up early.  That's always the way you like to start.

And then at the end I kind of let down a little bit and I tried to give Alex a bit of life, but fortunately for me I had good bonus there and I finished good on 16.
SCOTT CROCKETT:  You like match play.  Do you feel the same way about this event?
SERGIO GARCIA:  It's great to play match play once in a while.  Unfortunately we don't get to play much, until we start playing those two events.  But it's nice to get here.  Unfortunately I would like to see this course play fast and firm because I think it can be a very challenging course if it plays fast and firm, because the greens are pretty small and the fairways are not too big.  So it would be a very, very nice challenge for us.

But unfortunately the weather has been bad every time we come here.
Q.  You've played well in all kinds of weather.  Do you consider yourself a good mudder generally or does it depend on how you're playing at the time?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Of course, there's no doubt that if I could choose I'd rather play in wind than in rain.  It feels more comfortable for me, although it might be tougher.  But you've just got to deal with it.  That's what you get, and you've just got to look at it the best way possible.

The day was beautiful; unfortunately the course just took a little water, so it's quite wet.  But other than that, it's pretty good.
Q.  Do you have a feeling that this year might be a special year, or do you always have that feeling?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I don't know, I guess I feel good about myself.  I feel like I'm playing well.  I feel like my short game is starting to come around nicely.  But I don't know, we'll just wait and see.  I just want to go slowly, slowly but surely, and I'll just try to keep doing the right things.

I think if I keep working on the same way I've been working, I'll have a good chance of doing some good things.  If I don't, then I'll struggle.  We'll see, time will tell.
Q.  How did the weather affect your preparation this week?  When did you get in, and have you been over at Taylor Made, or how have you been getting ready?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I got in here on Sunday night and just pretty much relaxed on Monday after all the rain and stuff.  We couldn't practice much.  I worked out a little bit, and then practiced Tuesday.  And then on Wednesday because of all the rain again, I decided to practice my chipping and putting a little bit and just work on it a little bit again.  I just took it pretty easy, watched a bit of soccer on ESPN and just enjoyed in general my time a little bit.
Q.  When was the last time you were at a golf course and played some holes, last week?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Tuesday.
Q.  You played a practice round?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yes, Tuesday I played.
Q.  How much does your success last year, winning twice, the Ryder Cup and all that, carry over to this year?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, it's not that important, but every year is a new year and you start from scratch.  Whatever you did last year, I mean it can be nice confidence wise, but it's not going to do anything for you this year.  So you have to go back and do the right things like you did last year.  That's what we're trying.

I feel like I've become a much better player in the past year and a half or so.  I feel like I'm a lot more consistent than I used to be.  So I guess it's just a matter of keep trying hard and hopefully it will happen.
Q.  Have you put on more muscle since last year?  You look like you've been working out more.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, I've been working out a little bit.  I do weigh a bit more, probably muscle weight.  But nothing, just normal workout.  You get bigger as you get older.
Q.  You look like you have the strength of ten now.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah.
Q.  Are you talking about a couple of pounds or half a stone or what?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, probably by the end of    towards the end of 2003 I was about 160 pounds and now I'm probably about 170 something    I don't know, I was about 68 kilos and now I weigh about 75.  So I did put on a bit.
Q.  That's it, you want to stay at 75?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  I don't want to get too strong, either.  You still work out, but not to get too pumped up.
