 Q.  A great match.  How do you feel it went there?  Are you still a little shocked right here on this 18th green?  
SERGIO GARCIA: It's never easy.  Obviously I needed the putt to win.  I had the chance of tying it up.  I hit a good putt.  It was really, really slow.  I guess that's why my chip didn't -- we didn't play great.  We definitely didn't make anything, neither of us.  I think we made probably two or three putts between the two of us.  At least I think we both fought hard.   
 Q.  Your lovely fiancÃ© is here from Austin.  You are getting married here pretty soon.  Does it feel like a home away from home?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Kind of, yeah.  The people have been great.  She went to the University of Texas, here in Austin.  We spent a little bit of time here, not a lot.  It is nice to feel kind of like a second home.   
 Q.  You're a lovely couple.  Getting half a point, that's not bad either?  
SERGIO GARCIA: It is a good half.  At the end of the day, if I win my next two matches, I'm through.  If I would lost today, it puts me in a situation where I don't depend on myself anymore.
