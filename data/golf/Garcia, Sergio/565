Q.  You bounced back from a disastrous double bogey on No. 11, what happened there?
SERGIO GARCIA:  You know, as we were talking again, the wind kind of played a little trick on me.  It was kind of left to right and I was sitting there with a 3 wood, just tried to hit a drawing 3 wood into the fairway and it switched and went straight down.  Kind of backed away and instead of grabbing the 2 iron that was probably the club to hit, I tried to hit 3 wood and squeeze it in between the water and the right side of the fairway and then pulled it left and hit it in the water.

But, you know, it's one of those things, I knew that I was playing well and that I was putting well, and, you know, I just had to keep doing the right things.  Came back nicely with a birdie on the next, almost eagled that hole and from then on, I played very solid and got a couple bad breaks.  I managed to get around very well.
Q.  Talk a little bit, everything just consistent today?
SERGIO GARCIA:  It was.  I mean, I really feel like I only really missed that shot as a really miss, that tee shot on 11, probably just because of bad management there with the wind and everything.  I felt like I was striking the ball very nicely, hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens and I putted well.  So it's a good mix.  I had a couple tough breaks at the beginning on the front nine, and I got through it nicely and that helped a lot.
Q.  Talk a little about your level of confidence now going into the weekend.
SERGIO GARCIA:  It's good.  I'm looking forward to it.  I've really enjoyed playing with Jonathan these last couple of days.  I think the course is getting tougher every day.

So it's going to be interesting to see how things develop tomorrow and how firm the greens are going to be and if the fairways are going to keep firming up a little bit.  So it will be interesting to see how it goes.
Q.  Would it be hard to project a number for Sunday afternoon?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, I think so.  I think if we get a little bit of wind and the course keeps firming up like it is, the winning score can change very dramatically in a very short period of time.
Q.  Guys have said that 5 under par for the weekend total would be a really good weekend.  Do you think that's fair?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Definitely, yes.  I really think that 5 under is going to be probably around the Top 10, no doubt about it.  Even with the scoring that we have right now.  Because this course is just going to get tougher, so it does sound like it.
Q.  If you were to put together two rounds of a 70 69?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, I'll take that or two 69s and wait and see what happens.
Q.  Talk about when Jonathan leaves, what that does to your rhythm and how you adjust to that?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, it really, you know, you've got to get used to it.  The only thing it did was we started having more time.  We were waiting on pretty much every hole.  So it helped us get a bit more time thinking about the shot; with the weather conditions that we had with the wind going all over the place, it really helped a little bit.
Q.  How radically different are the weather conditions with the wind today than they were yesterday morning?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, yesterday morning it was quite similar.  It did blow a little bit, not a whole lot but it did blow enough to make you think a little bit, but the greens were softer, so it was a little bit easier to get the right clubs and everything.  This afternoon, you were getting some release on the greens and some shots kind of got a little bit uncomfortable to pull the right clubs and things like that.  So I guess that's pretty much the difference.
