SERGIO GARCIA: It wasnât a great start, but I came back nicely after a couple of early bogeys.  I played really solid after that.  I felt like I hit a lot of good shots, made a couple of good putts and a couple of good up-and-downs when I needed it, and Iâm very happy with the final result.   
Weâve had a lot of rain, but the course is still challenging.  Itâs not as brutal as it was, so it gives you a bit more playability.   
I didnât play great early on.  I made a couple of bad swings early on, on 1 where I made par, then 2 and three-putted 3, so it was nice to hit two good shots on 4, get it on the green and make a nice easy birdie.  That settled myself a little bit.  I gave myself a few chances and made some putts.   
I hit my driver really well today.  I only missed two fairways.  I hit a great drive on 17 and then hit a pretty nice putt and then made the one coming back, which was nice.   
Every time you win, it gives you extra confidence.  I felt last week I had a couple of days where I couldnât really practice that great and this week didnât start great, but Iâve settled down a bit and hitting the ball well, and hopefully it will be similar to Byron Nelson.
