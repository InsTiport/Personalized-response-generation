  SERGIO GARCÃA:   I think this afternoon it was playing a little tougher than this morning.   A little more breeze and the wind switched on 12 for us, and the way I was kind of feeling, I'm not disappointed with it I guess.  
   
 Q.   Describe your second shot to 13, although it didn't result in an eagle it was a terrific shot to the flag?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, no, I hit a great tee shot with a 3‑wood and hit a wonderful 5‑iron.   I thought it got up a little bit in the wind and thought it might just come up just a little short but fortunate enough to hit the pin and almost went in.  
   
 Q.   Saw you holding your left shoulder as you walked down to see me, any problem there?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I don't know, this morning it was a little tight in the back and as the day went on it's been bothering me a little bit more.   
Where it bothers me the most is putting because with the claw grip, the way I putt, is just left arm only and if I'm not feeling great with, that obviously I hit a good amount of bad putts that I usually don't, that I haven't hit for a while.   So you know, hopefully we'll get it fixed.  
   
 Q.   With some treatment on that, tomorrow morning you go out with an opportunity to go low?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, hopefully, I want to feel better, obviously if it doesn't get better than what it is right now, I don't know if I'll play tomorrow or not but I want to make sure that we get it fixed and it's just the beginning of the year, so hopefully it will be okay.   
   
 Q.   Give us your impression of the golf course and it's condition, some players this morning are saying it's fantastic?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It's definitely amazing.   Obviously the greens in the afternoon, you can see a couple spike marks here and there, but the fairways and tees are in perfect condition.   The greens are really, really good and rolling beautifully.   I'm sure in the morning they are unbelievable.
