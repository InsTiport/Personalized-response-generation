 Q. Can you talk a bit about how you played today and what went wrong out there and what
happened that you made the bogeys that you made?
 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I didn't play really well today. I felt -- I didn't feel very
good, like I was doing last week or something. But I just missed too many shots and too
many putts. But I guess it was one of those rounds where nothing goes the right way. And I
just hope it will be the only one in the tournament. And let's see if we can make three
good rounds to finish with. 
 (Translated from Spanish) 
 I played badly today and I didn't feel comfortable hitting the ball. I didn't putt
well. Now I'm going straight to the putting green and later to the driving range. Let's
see if I can shoot three good rounds and let's see what happens. The wind is making the
course more difficult, especially because of all the trees. I think it should have been a
few shots less today, but I am not playing as well as I did last week. If you miss six
greens and you make five or six bogeys, that's no good, is it? I was not myself today, at
all. It was just one of those days when you feel so-so. I have been sneezing all night. I
didn't sleep well. I haven't felt well all morning. It was just one of those days when
nothing goes your way. Today I hit the driver off the tee more than normal. I hit it on
the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 17th. It's not that I want to play with more
or less wind. The only thing I want to do is play better, and that's it. If the wind keeps
blowing the scores will be very high. Let's see if I can shoot three very good rounds.
This has been a very good year for me. No matter what happens this week nothing is going
to change that.
