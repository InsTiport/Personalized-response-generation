  Q Round of 66, it's the 11th time you've shot 67 or better on this course.  How well do you feel you played today?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I felt comfortable out there for sure.  I felt like I hit a lot of good shots.  Conditions obviously were good, but they were tricky.  The greens are a little patchy when it comes down to firmness.  Some spots are really firm and some spots you can definitely spin it.  So it's just a matter of getting the right hops there.
 But other than that, I felt like it was a good, solid day, and very happy with the way it went.
 Q When you won the Sanderson Farms on the PGA TOUR in October you said it felt like the old you.  What did you mean by that, and was it about shaping shots,and was it hitting the shot you wanted to, and what's been the key to it?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, for sure, confidence, it's important.
 But equipment, I'm a lot happier with the equipment that I have now because I feel like I can do that.  I can shape shots and I can do a little bit more what I used to do.  That obviously has been a process, a building process when it comes down to confidence and I'm very happy to see where I'm heading.
 So I think that it's a big year, and hopefully I can be in good shape because I want to be a part of a lot of things this year.
 Q Playing with Collin Morikawa out there today, and making your first cut on The European Tour at the age of 15, two years before he was born.  You've been out here for quite a long while.  What fuels the desire now, with all the success and all the tournaments you've played in, over 550, what fuels the desire?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   The desire's still there.  I think at the end of the day, we're till competitors and obviously, don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed playing with Collin today, but you know, obviously my focus, it's a little bit different than it was with family and getting married and having kids and stuff.
 But that doesn't mean that I'm still -- that I'm not a competitor.  I still love to compete.  I love to practice, try to get better and that's what I try to do all the time.  So it's nice to see rounds like one today, because it shows that I'm putting some good work in there and just got to keep doing more of that.
