  STEVE TODD:   Sergio, welcome to the Volvo World Match Play, thank you for joining us today.   We had Branden Grace talking about going for a potential hat trick of Volvo titles and of course you're going for a hat trick of your own after your two wins last year.   Your thoughts on going for another victory on home soil.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, everybody knows how exciting and how special it is for any guy to play in his own country.   In this case, obviously for me being Spanish and playing here in Spain is always very special.   
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.   I just hope that I can get my game in good shape for tomorrow, and have a couple of good days to qualify for Saturday and then we'll see what happens.   
STEVE TODD:   If you can just reflect on your group a little bit.   Obviously you've got Hiratsuka and Alvaro, as well, a couple of good matches for you.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, definitely.   I think there are good players everywhere, in every group.   It's going to be difficult no matter what.   
Obviously Alvaro I know very well, and you know, he's a great player.   With his game, he'll be tough to beat.   And Hiratsuka, I have not played with him that much, but obviously we know the potential that the Japanese players have, so it will be another competitive match.   
Hopefully I can play nicely, and if I manage to do that, then, you know, get a couple of wins obviously and get through; if not, I have to at least get one and make sure that my differential is good.  
   
 Q.   A lot of people were surprised, even shocked, how at the Masters how negative you sounded in the quotes that got widely used about your chances in majors going forward.   Was that just catching you at the wrong time or how do you feel?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I guess it was a combination.   I think obviously there was some frustration in there after kind of playing my way out of the Masters on Saturday.  
And then a little bit, I don't know, you may call it reality; I've been out here for 13 years, played every major since I've been a pro other than the U.S. Open in '99.   
So, you know, it's just been one of those things when sometimes I have played, I have played myself out of it and sometimes I have gotten beaten.   It just feels like it's taken a long time, and you know‑‑ I don't know, I mean, it doesn't mean that I'm not going to go in a couple of weeks when I go to the U.S. Open and try my hardest to win it.   But at the moment, it's taking a little bit of time to be able to do it.   
   
 Q.   Match play gives you an out from that, and you've got a fantastic record in it; would you put yourself down as a contender for this week?   Would you get on yourself?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   At moment, probably not.   I didn't feel great last week the way I was hitting the ball.   The last couple of days, I felt a little bit better but still not quite what I want it to be.   
So I think the good thing is, hopefully if I get going throughout the week, if I have a couple of good matches and I can get myself going, get some confidence, it could be good.   
But, you know, we know how match play is.   It can go either way.   Hopefully I'll start getting a little bit better and I'll feel a little bit nicer with my game, and you know, just kind of try to get some momentum true the week.   
   
 Q.   Does it feel like a bit of a grind at times?   Do you have fun?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Definitely.   But there's definitely moments where it is a grind.   Like everything in life; there's moments where things seem to happen easily and there's moments where things just don't want to happen.   I think it happens in all aspects of your life, not only in golf.   
I think that's the beauty of this game.   That's why we love it so much; if it was easy, and then you would probably get tired of playing it.   
   
 Q.   Another question, and perhaps on to happier matters.   Real Madrid is obviously leading the league; a couple of Manchester City guys in the Pro‑Am today, do you see them as a threat to Spanish domination?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Man City?   Well, obviously they have a good team to be able to beat Manchester United and Chelsea and Arsenal; the guys that are usually up there contending in the Premiership, they obviously have a good team.   I have seen some of the matches they have played.   
So it's hard to say.   At the same time this year, they were in the Champions League, and you know, they unfortunately couldn't get to the group stages.   But I think it's a brand new team, so it's a good time to get kind of done and get comfortable; I think they are starting to.   
To tell you the truth, I don't think at the moment there's anybody better than Real Madrid and Barcelona.   They are just too good‑‑ they are good, too, just not that good.   
   
 Q.   Players that are not here this week ‑‑  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, it is a little bit of a shame, but I guess you know, with THE PLAYERS last week in the U.S., some of them, I don't know, either stayed or they played the week before and maybe too many weeks in a row.   
But I think that it's still a great field, and that's the important thing.   We will try to show the people that come to watch us, show the best that we can do, and hopefully they will leave the week with a good taste in their mouth.   
   
 Q.   How much of a priority is the Ryder Cup to you this year?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It's very important, no doubt about it.   You all know how important The Ryder Cup is for me.   So I'm looking forward to it.   There's still a long time to go.   But you know, I have a good possibility if I play half‑decent to get into the team, and that is definitely one of my goals.   So hopefully we'll be able to be there.  
   
 Q.   And last time when you were there, obviously as an assistant to the captain, did that make you even more determined, and did you enjoy it or did you hate every moment of it?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, I enjoyed it, because The Ryder Cup is special, but I don't really want to do it again as a vice captain.   
Am I more determined to make the team?   No, I'm as determined as I was before.   Every time I try as hard as I can; sometimes a little bit better, sometimes a little bit worse.   But it obviously would be great to be in that team.   
   
 Q.   Are you even more excited because it's at Medinah and your record there?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, not really.   Just saying Ryder Cup, that makes it special enough.   You don't need to add anything to it.   Ryder Cup is special.   It's my favourite event, other than the British Open.   So you know, you just‑‑ you don't need to add anything to it to make it more special; at least for me.   
   
 Q.   At Medinah the shot everyone remembers is the one by the tree‑‑  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It's not there anymore.   
   
 Q.   They cut it down or something?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Unfortunately I think it died.   Yeah, it's a shame.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to try anything different, or have you tried everything in terms of preparation or the way you played?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I think that I tried everything that I'm capable of, and there's no‑‑ I don't think there's a way that you say, you know, if you do this, it's going to happen like every single time.   It just doesn't work like that.   
You try to prepare the best way you can.   And then, it's just a matter of having the week; having the week where‑‑ whether the everything is right on, when things are happening and you hit a bad shot and you get a good break and it kind of keeps your momentum going.   You just need one of those weeks and unfortunately I haven't had it yet.   
The good thing is, that if I'm fortunate enough and injuries don't go against me, I still am probably going to have a lot of chances.   So hopefully I get lucky one of those days.   
STEVE TODD:   Thank you.
