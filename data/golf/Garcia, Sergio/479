  Q. It wasn't the lowest round of the day, but nonetheless, you went shooting up the leaderboard.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it was good. I played really good on the back nine. You know, I'm happy that I finished with a few birdies on the last four because I left probably at least two or three out there on 11 to 14. But it was good. I played solid, played better than yesterday, and I rolled the ball nicely. A couple putts here and there could have gone in that didn't, but overall I'm in a good position.   
  
  Q. You've got to be pretty happy with your position going into the weekend. You played solid golf today.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: I did, yeah. I played good. I would have loved to have made a couple more maybe on the back nine, a couple good putts that unfortunately didn't go in. But overall it was a good solid round to put me into the weekend. The way the course is playing, you know you have to shoot around these kind of scores if you want to try to move up a little bit.  
  
  Q. It looked like you and Vijay were having a lot of fun out there and almost feeding off each other. How cool is it to be able to play out there with one of your friends on the golf course and both of you start playing really well?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, obviously he didn't play as well as he did yesterday. Yesterday he played unbelievable. But he got going a little bit on the back nine, too, and it's always nice when you play with a friend of yours. It makes things a little bit more fun, and it's good to see both of us playing well.
