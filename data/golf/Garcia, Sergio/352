  SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, I think I scored well.   I didn't think I played that great.   I didn't feel like I hit the ball that great.   I managed to score nicely, and that's the main thing.   That's the nature of the game.   So happy about that and hopefully we can do the same thing on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   When you came off the Pro‑Am, it was very heavy rain and a miserable day out there but we've been lucky in conditions haven't we by and large?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I think so.   The Pro‑Am it was very hard.   It was a very long day.   It was tough to get through it.   Yesterday was nice.   There wasn't much wind.   It was nice and warm.   Today, it was quite breezy which made the course play a little bit tougher.   
You know, any day that we don't get rain, we are happy with it.  
   
 Q.   Is it fair to say that you feared the worst, because some players did about the playing conditions for this week, and they have turned out to be a wealth of very good scores.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, I guess the rain on Wednesday softened up the course and made it a little bit easier for us to play.   Obviously these windy conditions make it a little more challenging.  
Yeah, it's been good so far.   Hopefully we'll get through the weekend with decent weather, and you know, it's nice, because that way the people can enjoy it, too.   
   
 Q.   You sound like as if you're just waiting for something to click to really make you happy out on the course.   The scores are good?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, definitely, there's still something that I need to find.   I hit the ball nicely.   I felt really, really good in Sweden.   Unfortunately last week I didn't feel that great.   This week, I'm not feeling‑‑ I'm not delighted about the way I feel about my game but we managed to score nicely and that's the important thing.
