Q.   Sergio, after an amazing come from behind win, you just looked over at the board and it's 13‑1 Europe.   What's going through your mind now?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, we need one more point at least.   A couple tight matches there, one coming‑‑ obviously Peter is coming to 18, so it's amazing.   I don't know how my teammates have done it.   We obviously haven't won, but what I'm saying is that to be able to have a chance today, right now in the last three games, it's already an achievement.

Q.   You told me in Wales you hated not playing, being the vice captain.   Did you love playing this week?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I did love it.   I love the Ryder Cup.   There's nothing I don't like about it.   The only thing I didn't like about it this year was my game.   Unfortunately, my game hasn't been great, but I found some ways and a couple things here and there and managed to get something for the team and hopefully it'll be enough.
