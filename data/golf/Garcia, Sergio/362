Q.   Sergio, there are many ways to shoot 68 and I understand yours was an interesting way.   Tell us about your day. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Golf is a funny game.   I can't believe I shot 73 yesterday, the way I played.   And today, I played nicely until the 12th hole.   And from then on, I just‑‑ I don't know what happened.   I just couldn't hit a straight shot, and I started chipping in, and then, you know, making great saves and made a nice birdie on the last. 
Nice to score well, which at the end of the day I guess is the important thing.

Q.   We have a runaway leader at the moment, Alvaro Quiros.   You had a big lead in Castellon earlier this year; it has its own challenges, doesn't it, having a big lead into the final round? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   It definitely does.   I think that you know that someone is going to attack you.   There's no doubt about that.   And you just have got to be comfortable and have a good start, feel confident, be calm, and hopefully maintain the lead. 
If you don't, then you make a bogey here there, and then they get within a couple, it kind of gets a little bit tighter.   So, we'll see.   I mean, they are not finished yet, but we'll see what happens. 

Q.   How do you feel about your position in the championship now, without knowing how Alvaro is going to finish up? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I think that yesterday, it was unfortunate, because I felt like I could have easily shot 3‑under on tough conditions.   Unfortunately didn't, and today, when I probably should have shot even par, I shoot 4‑under.   So I guess it kind of evens out. 
I need to go to the range and hit a couple of balls and kind of make sure that I have it sorted out for tomorrow.
