 Q. How does it feel to get that sort of reception (cheers of Ole! Ole! Ole!). 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I'm not even playing. It's great. Everywhere we go, but every time we come here to play, the crowds are just amazing. It's a shame that unfortunately they didn't get to see much golf but hopefully they will get some coming now, and some more birdies for the Europeans. 

 Q. Why do you love Ryder Cup as much as you do, because I know you really do. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: It's just so special. It's just so special. I mean, you just saw it, the atmosphere, the receptions you get, the first tee shot is just amazing. You know, all of the people are around and all of the cheers and all of the singing and everything, it's just, you don't get it anywhere. 
 And for us, it's something that we really, really enjoy and some of the rookies today, they were talking about it, they are on the moon.

 Q. Could this help you coming here and being part of this team, could it help you to get your mojo back, if you like?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Definitely. Definitely. There's no doubt about it. I played a little bit last week, and it's definitely -- my will with the game is definitely better. This is no doubt going to help me. 
 But that's not the main goal. The main goal here this week is for the team to play well, for us to regain the Cup, and you know, that's what we are going to try to do. 

 Q. What does Sergio GarcÃ­a bring to this backroom team?
 SERGIO GARCIA: I try to bring as much as I can. Unfortunately I can't bring any birdies, so I'll try to bring a little experience, a little joy, and just trying to help everybody as much as I can and make them feel as comfortable as possible.

 Q. I know how big of a fan and hero Severiano Ballesteros is, how special was that phone call with the team and tell us about what went on?
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was extremely special to talk to him, all of us, and listen to his voice and listen to him giving us some good cheers and asking some good advice. 
 So it was the perfect way to start The Ryder Cup for us, and we hope that that carries on. 

 Q. Tell us about the team spirit of this particular team; is it better than Valhalla? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I think we've been fortunate with that. I think that the team spirit has always been good. I think it's one of the strong keys about The European Team. 
 It's great. The atmosphere and everything around it, around the team, is very nice. Everyone feels very comfortable with each other. That's obviously very important. 

 Q. Have you been able to give some of the rookies pearls of wisdom about what they will experience in Ryder Cup? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: A little bit. You kind of tell them a little bit what they are going to see and just like, for example, Martin was a little bit worried that he didn't play that great this morning. And I said, just try to enjoy it. 
If you try too hard, you're probably not going to play as good as you know you're going to play and you're not going to enjoy it. 
 So it's a lose/lose situation. Just go out there, enjoy it, loosen up and it doesn't matter. Just play. You know how good you can play, and just let it come out. So he's going to be fine. 

 Q. And what kind of job is Captain Monty doing so far? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: He's doing great. So far he's been bringing a lot to the team. He's been very talkative. He's trying to help everyone, so I think he's done an excellent job so far, and you know, we just hope that we'll try to keep helping him and make his job a little easier.
