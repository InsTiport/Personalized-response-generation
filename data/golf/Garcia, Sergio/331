 Q.   Were you inspired by the man on your sleeve?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   There's no doubt, there's no doubt that it's been part inspired by him but also mostly from our captain, JosÃ©.   What an amazing guy.   What an unbelievable captain, no matter what the outcome will be.   He's an unbelievable.   He's one of the nicest guys I've ever met, and you know, it's amazing.   
   
 Q.   You were a vice captain last time and missed out playing on the team, how us how it feels emotion‑wise to be back here winning vital points?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know.   It's been a hard week.   I haven't felt very comfortable.   I just tried as hard as I could.   I got a little bit lucky today, a couple shots here and there.   And Jim gave a couple away, he missed some crucial putts, and I couldn't be happier for my team.   
   
 Q.   We saw what the pressure of those closing holes did to Jim Furyk.   Can you describe what it was like to play under those circumstances today?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   It was tough.   It wasn't easy.   And probably a little bit tougher for myself because I wasn't feeling 100 percent with my game.   But somehow I managed to hit good enough shots.   
I think there were a couple key moments, obviously 11 was huge to be able to halve that hole.   And then winning 13, a great up‑and‑down; the up‑and‑down on 16, and then he lips out, that was huge.   You know, he missed a couple shots coming in and I was able to make a couple solid pars and that was good enough.  
   
 Q.   And your point has taken Europe on the brink of retaining this cup.   If I told you this yesterday Saturday lunchtime, would you have believed me?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, we did believe it.   We knew it was very difficult to be able to put ourselves in front of a very good team.   But, you know, it's great to see that my teammates have come along and hopefully we'll get what we need.
