 Q.  I thought you hit the ball very solid today, was it a matter of just getting some putts to fall?  Still a great opening, mind you.  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I feel like I was hitting the ball really, really well at the beginning when it was playing quite firm.  Obviously, I left myself a nice short easy eagle putt there on 9 to finish with.   
Then the back nine I felt like I hit it pretty decent.  I left myself a good amount of birdie looks, not extremely close, but a couple here and there 15, 16, nice to make 15, unfortunately 3-putted 14 after hitting a good shot.  But overall it was a good round and happy to be done.   
 Q.  We spoke to Kevin Na and he suggested the course played very different after the rain delay.  Did you find it was playing much different when you came back out?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Definitely.  It was playing beautifully early in the morning when it was firm.  Fairways were running, you had to hit good tee shots, you had to hit good shots into the greens.  Unfortunately, the rain made it soft and then made it easier for everybody that started after the rain delay.  But it is what it is.  I think that 3-under this morning, the way that the course was playing, it would have been a really, really good round and unfortunately we're probably not even going to finish in the top-10.   
 Q.  What would you like to do better to keep vaulting up this leaderboard?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Well I feel like I hit some good putts.  Obviously, I would love to hit it a tiny bit closer to the hole.  That would be nice.  A lot of good shots that went maybe 20, 25 feet away.  So, hopefully we can do that and the greens are running beautifully, so hopefully we can make some birdies.
