  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Welcome back to Germany and the BMW International Open. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Danke schÃ¶n. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Bittes.   And that's the extent of my German.   I suppose start us off on last week.   You went very close in America.   Can't do much about someone birdieing the last seven holes to beat you by one.   But you're in good form? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yes, obviously played nicely last week at the Travelers, but Kevin ways just on fire making those seven birdies to finish with. 
But overall it was a good week.   It was a nice, solid week to have there and very excited about this week.   I think the course is playing‑‑ I think the course is in the best shape I've ever seen it, no doubt about it.   It's playing very, very nicely.   It's quite firm, so hopefully if it doesn't rain, it's going to be a great tournament.   The course is playing exactly the way it should play, and playing fast and firm, and you know, some of those pins will get tricky when they are near the corners of bunkers and things like that.   It looks really, really nice.
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   As always, BMW looking after you well; saw you driving the i8 yesterday, or were you Henrik Stenson's passenger? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I was copilot.   It's a nice car.   We had a good time there. 

Q.   What is it that brings you every year to Germany in general? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Usually I come with a plane (laughter).   I'm kidding.   I think that I've always‑‑ obviously there are different reasons for me to come to Germany. 
Obviously I've always enjoyed playing here in Germany.   I've been quite successful and I felt like the people have all welcomed me very nicely.   I think we've had a good relationship with BMW for some years now, so it always makes it a little bit easier to come and play here.   You know, obviously I have a lot of German things going on with sponsors, girlfriend, things like that, so yeah, I'm always excited to come back and play here. 

Q.   Four years ago we spoke, you had the Spanish dresson; we don't have to see that.   Four years ago, you didn't make the cut and you played poorly and made the cut.   What changed the last four years with the Spanish National Team and with you? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   This year, the Spanish National Team, they didn't play very good and hopefully I will play very well (laughs). 
I think that obviously four years ago, I was in a different state of mind, as probably the Spanish team was.   I think obviously it's a little bit disappointing because we all had high expectations but it's understandable, too.   I think that they have had six amazing years, and the majority of the team is starting to get a little bit old, so they probably need to rejuvenate it a little bit. 
You know, it has had happen at some point and unfortunately it happened this year.   But I think we have good under 21s, so we'll be fine.   Thanks for your question; I'll support Germany now. 

Q.   Martin Kaymer is the home guy here.   Are you surprised by his performance in the last week? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, not at all.   I've known Martin for a long time now.   We get along quite well and we are friendly with each other.   Obviously he went through something similar to what I went like a year and a half, supple years of struggling a little bit and trying to find the right way and stuff like that on the course.   But obviously you can see that since The Ryder Cup, I think he's been improving every year and every month.   Obviously the victory at THE PLAYERS I think gave him such a big boost of confidence, and you can see even the week after winning THE PLAYERS, he shot like 7‑ or 8‑under the first round, and then you know, we all saw how well he played at the U.S. Open. 
So he's done it before, and it's not really a surprise now. 

Q.   The Top‑10 in the world now, you have the feeling there are a small group of players who could actually dominate. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, only ten of them‑‑ (laughter).

Q.   There's not just one anymore.   Is the game as healthy as it's been in a long time? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   I would say so.   Obviously Tiger has been out for three months.   But yeah, I think if you look at‑‑ like you were saying, if you look at the Top‑10 right now with Adam, Henrik and Bubba and Kuchar and Jason Day, it's a great mix of players.   I think that fortunately, we all seem to be playing at a good level, which I think is always exciting for the golf world.   You know, hopefully we'll be able to keep that going. 
You know, like you said, it's nice and healthy at the moment, so it's good to see. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Many thanks for joining us.
