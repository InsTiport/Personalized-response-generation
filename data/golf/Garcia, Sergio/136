 Q.  And just when it was going so well --  
SERGIO GARCIA: It's a shame, I just overhit my second shot on 16 a little bit, and still looked like it was going to hold on, and unfortunately it went in the water.   
Other than that, I felt like I played really nicely all day.  I hit a lot of good shots, a lot of good drives, a lot of good putts.  So it was a good round.  A lot of tough pins out there today for the first day, so I guess that's why the scoring is not maybe as low as we've seen it some other years.   
 Q.  One mistake doesn't take the shine off it.  So how good do you feel now about the next three days?  
SERGIO GARCIA: If I keep playing like this, I like my chances.  I felt like my game was on in pretty much everything that I was doing, so that kind of showed.  We've got to keep going the same way for the next three days.   
 Q.  Just by being here is a measurement of your success over the years and your commitment to The European Tour.  What do you think about the Rolex Series for next year, these big events?  What's that going to do for the Tour and for players like you?  
SERGIO GARCIA: I think it's great.  I think it's going to help all of us.  Keith Pelley and his group are doing obviously a good job.  They are working hard, and it's not easy.  They are starting to show some nice things, so we're excited about it.   
You know, for me, obviously I've played The European Tour for almost 20 years now, so I've always enjoyed playing here.  I'll keep doing that as long as my body allows me to.
