Q. (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA: Definitely.  Definitely.  And when things are not going great I tried to think of her and it brings a smile to my face.  And I definitely think that it helps me.  But, you know, it's been fun.
But at the end of the day, like I said earlier, Xander played unbelievable on the front nine, tricky conditions, and he kept making good putt after good putt on me.  So I was just hoping to stay in it and give myself some chances as soon as he gave me a little opening on 12.  And then I was able to make a great birdie on 13 and 15 and 16.  And that kind of closed the match a little bit for me.
Q. (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I mean I love playing golf, no matter what.  Obviously match play it's fun, because like you say -- as an amateur we play a lot more than as a professional.  It is nice to play it a little bit here and there.  Obviously I would love to have done a little better than I have.  I have had some good weeks here.  But not probably as good as I should have.  So hopefully this week it will be better.
Q. It would be easy for someone to say it's probably tough to focus on this week, but how are you able to limit everything and focus?
SERGIO GARCIA: The way I looked at it, when I was 2 down, the way I looked at it today, well, we're going to try to turn it around, but if we don't, it means that I get to spend more time with Angela and Azalea for the weekend.  I tried to look at it in a good way.  It didn't mean that I wanted to lose.  But that's the way I kind of looked at it.  And like I said earlier, thinking of them kind of brought a little smile to my face.  And then I was able to get going nicely.
Q. How were you able to finish so strong all through your matches?
SERGIO GARCIA: I don't know, it just kind of clicked on the back nine.  I feel like I've played well in the front, just a couple of mistakes here and there that I've been a little bit more punished by it, but mainly some strong playing from my opponents on the front nine.
I think Dylan yesterday on very tough conditions with firm greens and very windy, I think was 2- or 3-under par.  I think Xander today was 3-under par or something like that.  It's not easy to keep up with that pace on these conditions.
