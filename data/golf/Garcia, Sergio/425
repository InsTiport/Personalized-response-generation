  Q. I imagine you'd have been happier if you'd got into double figures to get a little bit closer to Westwood, but you're not out of it yet.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Definitely. We got to double figures but unfortunately hit a poor shot on 16 with a wedge. Almost made a great four. But you know, it's one of those things.   
 I felt like under the conditions we played fairly well. We hung on nicely and we gave ourselves a lot of birdie chances. You know, the course is slowly playing a little bit tougher with this breeze and the greens firming up a little bit, getting a little quicker.   
 Would have loved to probably shot three shots better.   
  
  Q. Westwood looks like he's in determined mode the way he's playing.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: He's been playing great for the past 2 1/2 years. He got a win this year if Portugal and you can see he's got a lot of confidence. He's playing nicely and he's doing everything well. You can definitely see that.   
  
  Q. Allenby shot 7-under the other day there; presumably that's well within your compass if you can just get a few putts to go down.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, well, it's possible. You have to play really well. The pins are quite tough. It's not easy to hit it close to some of these pins. If you roll your putter amazing and you make a lot of putts, you can shoot that kind of score. It's always easier to do it earlier in the week than it is as the week goes on.
