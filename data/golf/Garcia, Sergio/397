  Q. That was a very nice round today, talk about what was going right for you?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Well, like you said, it was pretty nice. I felt like I hit the ball pretty good. Maybe a little better than yesterday, and hit a lot of fairways, a good amount of greens again, and managed the two or three greens that I missed, I managed to hit some good chips. Yeah, it was pretty solid overall, and you know, just happy to be able to go through two rounds on this course without making a bogey.  
  
  Q. Good start, too, three birdies in the first four holes, something like that?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Yeah, the start was a dream start, good drive on the first, hit a 7-iron and hit it to three feet. Easy birdie to start with. Kind of settles you down a little bit.   
 Then I made a nice putt on 11 for birdie. Hit it close on 12. Almost made birdie and then I hit a great shot on 13, but just hit it over the green and chipped it in. So it was a really nice start.  
  
  Q. Your shot on 9 out of the rough, how treacherous was that shot?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: The good thing was that it was into the wind, so I knew that I could stop it if I hit it properly. So it wasn't like a full-blooded flop shot because it was a little bit into the wind and I was kind of chipping at the green. If I would have been ten yards farther, then it would have been a bit more difficult.   
  
  Q. Do you feel with the wind down a little bit these first two days that it's necessary to take advantage now while you can?   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Well, if you can, yes. But it's not an easy course. It doesn't matter, with or without wind, this is a course that you have to place the ball nicely and you have to place it on the right side, you have to place it on the right side of the fairway, then on the greens, and if you're a little bit off, it can make it quite tough for you.   
 So I don't think it's -- people are playing nicely, but it's not that easy.   
  
  Q. What are you doing this year that is allowing to you have great success here?   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Well, just two days. I had some good rounds here and I've had two good rounds this year. Just like I said, I hit the ball nicely, I hit a lot of fairways, I hit a lot of greens and been chipping and putting nicely.   
 So everything seems to be on the right way.   
  
  Q. I thought yesterday you were really good and today even better. You must feel great?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: It was good, yes, definitely. It was positive. Like you said, I think I played nicely both days. Probably a little bit better today. To be able to go without making any bogeys for two days on this type of golf course, it's always a very positive thing. I might have had a couple of chances of making bogeys but I hit some nice chips, too. Seems like things are working out nicely.  
  
  Q. Did you did he tell stung by a bee out there today?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: I did, on the 14th, it was funny, early morning, just the fifth hole, I hit my drive on 14 on the par 5 and hit it a little bit left. I was walking off the tee and I felt like I had something on the back of my hat and I kind of thought maybe it was a leaf or maybe a little bug or something and I went to scrape it off, and it stung me on the finger.   
 Fortunately I was able to get the, whatever you call it, the stinger out, and it was fine. It was just the moment.  
  
  Q. Didn't affect you. Talk about your putting stroke and the grip. How would you describe the grip you're using?   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: How would I describe it? Left hand on top and right hand on the bottom (laughing).   
  
  Q. You have the shaft, seems a little --  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: No, it's kind of like something similar to Chris DiMarco's, it's some sort of claw, but a little bit different grip on the right hand. I don't know, I tried it last year in November in Dubai at the Dubai World Championship and it felt good, and for the last couple of days I've been going with it.   
 There's days where I make more putts and there's days where I make a little less, but the good thing is, I feel like I'm hitting a lot golf putts and that's the most important thing.  
  
  Q. Looks like you're having fun out there as you approach the weekend, what a great story this would be, but what is your thought process now?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Same thing. Just keep trying to do the right things, and see what we finish. I'm not worried about winning. I just want to keep building confidence into my head, and these rounds obviously help. If we go out there tomorrow and shoot another round, beautiful. If not, that's fine. I've just got to make sure that I keep building up.
