  SERGIO GARCIA:   Third hole.   Well, no, first thing is a bad drive, to start with.   There's no high rough in the middle of the fairway.   So you know that you can get bad lies when you hit it in this rough.   Obviously it's very thick.   But yeah, I actually‑‑ I actually hit it too good.   I thought with all the grass it might come out a little left, and it didn't.   And it went through the fairway and then I had no shot.   I had to chip out and just an easy 6.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, not really.   No, no, I didn't feel‑‑ obviously I hit a couple of good shots here and there, but I didn't feel comfortable all day.   I haven't felt comfortable all week, just not able to swing the way I know I can.   And just kind of working with what you have and trying to get around it.   Obviously it's a shame because it was an ideal day to shoot a decent score and unfortunately my game just wasn't up to the test.

Q.   I was curious when you first birdied (inaudible). 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, it was‑‑ no, I mean I could get it up, no problem.   I had to grip it quite short.   My feet were a little bit up against the edge of the bunker.   So it wasn't like a normal stance, which was just‑‑ I actually felt I hit a good shot.   I didn't think I was going to be able to hit it that far that easily with the lie. 

Q.   When you guys got around the 12th, 13th green and you look at the boards and there's six and four guys on the board, it's alarming for the first round of an Open?
SERGIO GARCIA:   It's alarming.   Like I said before, the day was perfect to do it.   Obviously with all the rain we had, the greens were soft.   The fairways were soft.   So if you're hitting the ball half decent you could hit a lot of fairways, you hit a lot of greens, you could attack most of the pins. 
And then the greens are in very good shape, so you could roll some putts in.   Unfortunately I didn't manage to do pretty much any of them.   I hit some good putts, left some short, two in the jaws just short of the hole.   A couple of lip‑out putts here and there.   But just didn't play well enough, simple as that.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, it's just‑‑ you know, it's just‑‑ when it doesn't feel good, those kind of things, usually my problem when I'm not feeling good on a swing is I kind of tend to lose my right hand.   I kind of lose the feel of it on the club.   Usually everything kind of gets a little bit behind me.   So it was just kind of that.

Q.   Can you talk about how Tiger played? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   How do I feel he played?   I don't know, he'll probably tell you better than I.   It doesn't matter what I think.   He'll tell you better what he thinks.
