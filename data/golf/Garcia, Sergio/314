 Q.   What a way to finish a pretty good second round for you.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, no, great, great to finish with a birdie on a very tough hole.   Obviously disappointed with a shot on 17.   But overall it was good.   It wasn't easy out there.   The course is getting firm.   
It's a tight golf course.   I managed to score well.   I probably didn't play amazing, but I managed to score pretty well.   
   
 Q.   As you said, the conditions getting a little bit more difficult with regards to the course, but the weather a little bit better today, not as breezy; did you feel like you needed to at least get a few under par?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, it definitely wasn't as breezy as yesterday morning.   I don't know if it was as breezy as yesterday afternoon, but it definitely felt like it calmed down a little bit.   
The winds are supposed to change tomorrow.   So, we'll see.   But the course was getting firmer, so it was difficult to get it close to some of these pins.   
   
 Q.   In the mix heading into the weekend, what's the game plan, only three back halfway through?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Nothing, just keep playing, and hopefully play well and see if we can have a chance on Sunday.  
   
 Q.   Would you like to see this course continue to get more difficult?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I think it is going to.   I've always enjoyed that, so if I manage to play well, that should play into my strengths.   If not, then it will be tough.
