Q. 67 to move yourself into contention.  What was the secret to that performance today?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know, a little bit of everything I guess.  Hit some good iron shots.  I didn't drive it quite as well.  I didn't feel like I drove it badly but it was a little bit windier, a little bit trickier.  Wasn't able to hit as many fairways.  But obviously a couple good birdies on the back nine and then a nice save on 12, and then obviously the chip-in on 17, that was a big bonus.
Yeah, happy with the score, but there's some things that we need to improve.
Q. You've won a lot of tournaments, including right here, 16 on The European Tour.  Question to you is:  The first one was in 1999, The Irish Open.  If you can remember what that felt like on the Saturday night, how different do you feel now having done what you have in your career, how do you feel differently at this stage with another opportunity?
SERGIO GARCIA:   You definitely feel different, there's no doubt.  Obviously things have changed a lot since then.  The excitement is still there obviously.  It is exciting and you feel nervous early on and stuff like that, which is normal, because it means that you really want it.  I don't know, you try to take it the best way possible and be as -- be as positive as you can be, commit to everything that you're doing, even though it's not easy.  You try to do that and hopefully have a great day and see what happens.
