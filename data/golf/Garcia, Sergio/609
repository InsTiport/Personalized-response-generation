Q.
6-under today.  Talk a little bit about your round.
SERGIO GARCIA:  You know, it was a nice round.  I got off to a good start, birdieing three of the first four, and I actually had a really nice try on 14 from about eight feet that I missed.  Then I hit a bad shot on 16, unfortunately made bogey there, where I had a good birdie opportunity and then got it going on the back nine.

I made a couple nice birdies, 2 and 3, hit two really good shots.  I hit it really close on 4 to about three feet and I missed it unfortunately.

Then I hit another great shot on 7 to about nine feet and made that for birdie, and unfortunately I missed the eagle putt on 9.  It's a shame, but my second shot was closer than my putt unfortunately.
Q.  You and Lee and Padraig and Luke all up there on the first page, did you guys have a Ryder Cup meeting and decide to come out and torch this place?
SERGIO GARCIA:  That's what we decide to do every week.  Some weeks we do better than others.  It's nice to see some fellow Europeans up there on the leaderboard and having a chance.  Steve Jones I think played an awesome round, too, and I give him a lot of credit.

I'm looking forward to the rest of the week and hopefully keep playing the same way I played.
Q.  Talk about the second shot on 9.  Describe that for me.
SERGIO GARCIA:  It was a great shot.  I hit a nice cut 3-wood and I don't know how close it was.  I thought it might be a two, and unfortunately it ended up being a four.
