SERGIO GARCIA:  Yes, but I had a 9-iron to the green.  I wanted to put it close, and maybe a little too aggressive; just short in the water.  Then, I don't know, I didn't hit a good lob wedge from there.  And then I had to drop again.  Hit a good lob-wedge, and missed the short putt.  But, you know, sometimes it happens.  And now I think I'm going to take a little rest.  I need it, and I'm going to be 200 percent for the Ryder Cup.


Q.  Do you just put this down to experience again?  The 16th hole was very costly.

SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, 16 and 18.  It's not the experience.  It's just, it didn't work.  It went the wrong way.  The first day I made birdie, and a couple -- the last couple of days I made bogey on 9.  What can you do?  Sometimes it goes that way.  You have to take it that way and just think that I'll hopefully be here next year.  And, well, I'll try to -- I'll try to win this tournament.  Now more than before, I want to win this tournament.


Q.  How much tougher did the course play today?

SERGIO GARCIA:  It was playing tough.  It was playing very tough because of the wind.


Q.  Were the pins hard as well?

SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, there were some good pins, and also the greens were harder.  But, you know, I was playing a great day.  And I hit the driver perfect, almost perfect.  And I'm so happy I hit it. I hit the ball really well today.  One of those things.


Q.  You'll be meeting all the Spanish press on Tuesday?

SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, it's because I think they deserve to know what's been happening these last weeks, and they really took care of me.  They were putting everything in the newspapers; so, I think they deserve a press conference.


Q.  Are you worried at all at the European Ryder Cup team, you guys didn't play that well.  Is Ryder Cup too far off or too early to go maybe --

SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, I'm not worried.  You don't know what's going to happen.  It's still three weeks to come, and it can happen, so many things.  But  we know what we can do, and we'll try to go out there and win the -- win the Ryder Cup.  If not, we'll try another year.  But I'm not --  I'm not worried about the Europeans didn't play great here.


Q.  Guys (European players) were pretty tired this week?

SERGIO GARCIA:  Yes, well, they have to play -- they had to play in Germany and they had to come here.  But, you know, we'll see at the Ryder Cup.
