 Q.  Good day?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, a little bit better.  Finally felt
like I knew what I was doing out there.  And it wasn't easy.  It
was definitely breezier than it was yesterday.  Very similar wind.
But I finally was able to hit some good shots and was able to
trust my shots a little bit better.  And thanks to that, I was
able to score nicely.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:  I don't know.  I can't tell you what's
going to happen this afternoon.  Obviously I needed to do
something like that today to have a slight chance.  But if someone
at 2- or 3-under shoots, 3- or 4-under par, it's going to be too
far back.
Q.  The course setting up easier today than the first two
days?
SERGIO GARCIA:  The majority of the pins were a bit more
accessible.  You could see that they put a little bit of water.  I
think that with being a little bit overcast this morning, even
though it cleared up, you could see that -- it was not as firm.
I'm not going to say it was soft, because it wasn't.  But it was
definitely not as firm, and you were able to -- if you drove the
ball well, you were able to hit some good shots at it.  But it's
definitely breezier than it was yesterday.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:  Great.  Every day.  Never had a
complaint.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:  I've always said this is -- as an
individual tournament, this is definitely my favorite.  And it
would be nice.  But hopefully it won't be the only one.
Q.  How do you describe your relationship with Padraig?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Good, yeah.  Normal.  I think we both
respect each other.  We seemed to be a little bit slow out there
today, but other than that it was fine.
Q.  You were on the clock for a couple of holes, does that
make it more difficult?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, I felt like I was rushing quite a
lot.  I mean, I even played out of position probably when it
wasn't my turn, probably two or three times to try to catch up.
But it's difficult when it's this breezy.  If you're not hitting
the ball well, you have to think so many things.  Because shots
from the rough, you have to realize where you want to fly it, how
much it's going to roll, take care of whichever bunker is around.
So it takes a little bit more time to realize or to
figure out all those things.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:  I think it's difficult when you're on the
clock.  It's difficult with anybody that is struggling, because
it's always going to take a little bit more time.  And it feels
like you have to make up for that time a little bit.  So I think
we tried as hard as we could, both of us.  And we managed to get
back on time.  I think it was on the 14th.  So, you know, the last
four or five holes were a little bit better.
