  Q. Looking at your matches and you're eight under for the last six holes, and you haven't lost a hole in the last six holes on the golf course?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: I didn't think about it, but I guess that was a good thing. So hopefully I can keep doing that and I get to those last holes and the championship.  
  
  Q. Well played this morning. This is obviously the farthest you've been in match play. Your thoughts so far?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, good. It's been a good week so far. I managed to get around it what we have. And today it was a tough day. It was quite windy. It was cool and the course was playing tough.   
 Neither Ollie or I played our best golf. But I think I managed to play well enough to get in the final event.  
  
  Q. We're getting to the matches where fatigue can be a problem. You're playing 36 today, and it's kind of managing your game. But in match play how different is it for you, because the consequences of a bad shot isn't as bad as maybe medal play?   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Oh, yeah, definitely. The consequences are always bad of a bad shot. Usually there's no good things that come out of a bad shot.   
 But I think that here you can kind of let it go a little bit more. You lose a hole, and it's not like you make a double and the other guy makes a birdie, so you deal with that. But hopefully I won't get many of those.
