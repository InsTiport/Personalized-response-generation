  Q. Great way to follow up your 5-under round yesterday.  7-under today.  Five birdies, an eagle.  Your thoughts on how well you played in the second round.
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Played nicely.  Definitely probably not as well as yesterday.  Couple loose shots in the middle of the round, but I recovered nicely obviously.
 Made a couple good up and downs and then holed out on 6 I think it was, so that obviously always gives you a little bit of extra calmness, I guess.
 But, yeah, good to finish with a birdie.  I felt like I hit two good shots on the last and had a nice chip, so very happy with the way the week is going so far.
 Q. Scrambled well today, five of five up and downs, including two sand saves.
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, like I was saying, in the middle of the round I hit a couple loose shots.  Probably the par on 14 was the best hole of the day, from a flat lie, no green to work with.  Have to hit the bunkers to give myself a chance, and then rolled probably a 16- or 17-footer for par.  That was massive, because then that helped me go birdie, birdie the next two holes.
 So that was always -- that was a nice momentum kind of going I guess.
 Q. Take us through the shot at 6.  You hole out I think it was 111 yards.  What was the club selection?  How did you see it after you hit it?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it was a 15-degree, my lob wedge, my most lofted club in the bag.  Hit a really nice shot just right of the hole a with a tiny little draw.  Obviously saw the ball bounce just right of the hole and spun.
 From where I was you couldn't quite see it, so I saw a little bit and I thought it hit the hole or hit the flag and I thought it stayed next to it.  Obviously people -- the little amount of people that were there, they kind of went crazy.  I was like, Is it in, and someone started going like this.  So then it was nice to know that it was in.
 Yeah, obviously would've been nicer to do with crowds, but even without crowds still very nice.
 Q. When is the last time you felt this good about your game?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   You know, it's funny.  It's funny because I felt -- earlier in the year I felt like I was playing as well as I've been playing the last week and a half; just things weren't really happening.
 So obviously it's a combination of playing well, confidence, couple good breaks when you need them at the right time that keeps your round going, and that's what I did.
 Like my par save on 14 today.  You know, two months ago that was probably a bogey at best.  I hit an unbelievable bunker shot from a flat lie and left myself about 16, 17 feet for par and I rolled it in.  Those are the kinds of things you need to keep your rounds going.
 You know, it's funny how it happens, but then I go birdie, birdie and almost birdie 17, too.  So it's -- you know, this game is -- it's funny when it comes down to those things. That's why when you have one of those good moments, you try to enjoy it as much as possible and hopefully make the most out of it.
 Q. One last thing.  Have you ever won back to back weeks?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.  In Europe, yes.
 Q. You did?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Yes.
 Q. Do you know what years?  I'll look it up, but...
 SERGIO GARCIA:   2011 I won Castell√≥ Masters and then I won in Valderrama.  And I don't know if I've done it another time, but for sure that one and I might have done it one more time, but I can't really.
 Q. You playing next week?
 SERGIO GARCIA:   Yes.
