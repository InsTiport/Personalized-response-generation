 Q.  That was a beautiful finish?  RORY McILROY: We needed it, we really did.  We were making life difficult for ourselves out there.  I don't think either of us was playing from the fairways very much.  We were 3-under for the last three holes. We just wanted to ask them a question and get them going and we were able to do that.  And Sergio had the shot of the day at the last.  It was big, and at least we get something out of the day.  We played two really tough matches and we have half a point to show for it.   Q.  Talk us through your putt on 17.  RORY McILROY: It was one of those you knew what you needed to do.  There was actually a little short of piece of dirt or I don't know what it was in the line, and it was sort of embedded in the ground, so I couldn't move it.  Sergio said it was easier to hit the hole than hit that.  I stood up and it was going at quite a speed, and I was lucky to hit the hole.   Q.  What about your drive?  SERGIO GARCIA: That was nice after the first few holes.  Finally felt like I hit it.  Their pair came and made a run for it and it was very quick.  I told Rory he's playing very quickly.  I said hopefully we'll have a good lie.  I was able to hit a great 5-wood from there.  I was very pleased with it.  I felt like I owed him a lot today.   RORY McILROY: We owed each other a lot, I think.   SERGIO GARCIA: We knew we weren't playing good.  We fought as hard as we could.  Half a point is just huge.
