Q.   Health update, if you can, saw you getting treatment on the course, what were the issues you were facing today? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, the same as yesterday.   Obviously it's a little bit of a tight shoulder, and trying to protect it, the neck and the arm gets a little bit sore from that. 
So that's pretty much the same that it was yesterday.   We got treatment yesterday and felt better this morning, but as the day goes on, giving it more shots, it tightens up a little bit.   So hopefully we'll work it out again and see if we can get it better every day. 

Q.   Was there a point in the round where you thought, I might not be able to continue? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Definitely, yeah.   We started on 10.   On the 14th green, I told my caddie, if it doesn't get better after 18, we'll probably walk.   Because what I don't want is to keep building up and not really recover it. 
Then, unfortunately, we started making birdies and eagles, and I thought, well, what do we do now.   So I got the physio out, robe, he worked on it a little bit, put some ball on it.   It did feel a little bit better.   It got a little stiff on the back nine again and then it kind of loosened up again.   So it definitely feels a little bit better than it felt yesterday.

Q.   Yesterday you said mainly when you putted you were uncomfortable, was today the swing a problem, as well?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   The only problem is I have a hard time releasing so most of my shots are kind of little fades.   So you know, that's the way it is, with the irons, I tried to hit a couple draws here and there, but it does feel hard to do it.   And with the putter, like I said, to keep it smooth, it's a little bit more difficult when your arm feels a little tense. 

Q.   Give us a sense of the conditions out there now and the conditions the players are going to face this afternoon when they play? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Definitely, we got windy conditions yesterday and today.   So we are hoping for nicer, calmer conditions like they did yesterday.   But it was blowing, and hopefully it just keeps blowing the same way all day.   You know, it's probably‑‑ it was blowing a little bit harder than it was yesterday afternoon. 
So obviously the course does not play as easy as it played yesterday in the morning, and you can see some 67s and 68s and something like that, but I think that if the wind stays like it is, 62s and 63s will be tough. 
It tightened up as I was hitting balls yesterday morning and on the course it got tighter and tighter as the day went on.   We worked out yesterday, felt fairly good throughout the night.   This morning, we worked on it again, and it was a little sore but we worked it nicely and it's pretty much the same thing, it just got tighter and tighter as the day went on. 

Q.   Is it the backswing when you feel it the most? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, it's the back of the shoulder.   But the problem is, because I'm trying to avoid that hurting, it gets my shoulder‑‑ it gets my neck a little sore and my forearm and my triceps a little bit.   So it is obviously a little swollen.   That's what the physios told me.   We'll have to rest it when we finish this week.

Q.   Have you had a problem in that area before in your career? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Not really.

Q.   And you're on painkillers, too?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, took some Advil, Ibuprofen I think it was. 

Q.   How much of a distraction is it during the round to have treatment done to you while you're playing your round?   Does it get inside your head almost? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, not really.   No, I think you kind of deal with it. 

Q.   Talk us through your first nine, you had a ball in the tree and then you had the eagle on 18.   Even though you were going through such pain, that's a pretty good stretch. 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Definitely.   It was a little unfortunate there on 12, obviously pulled it a little bit. 

Q.   Did it go in a tree?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Caught the last palm on the left and went on top of the ball.   The good thing is we were able to see it and our photographer took a picture of it and we were able to identify it, so I was able to drop down there and have a good bogey. 
And then we made a good birdie on the next, which was nice, and then obviously a great finish on the last three on the front. 

Q.   Can you tell us about 18, what clubs did you hit? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I hit‑‑ well, the wind was down on the left.   I hit 3‑wood for my tee shot.   I thought I pulled it a little bit, but I hit it nicely and it carried and then I had 219 to the pin.   I hit 6‑iron to about probably six, seven feet and had a little left‑to‑right up the little.
