 Q.  What is it with you at The Ryder Cup?  You've had a wonderful career but when you get to this event, something gets into you.  Can you describe it?  
SERGIO GARCÃA: I love it.  I love golf, playing every week.  Obviously this is very special for me -- sorry, I said that wrong.  This is very special for us.   
And to play with this guy, I mean, he was a rock out there.  He gave me so much confidence to be able to go for shots and go for putts and things like that.   
 Q.  One of six rookies, very shrewd move by your captain, he not only put you with an experienced and accomplished player, but he put you with a countryman.  How much of an impact did that have?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Well, I've been practicing with Sergio and learning from his game throughout the entire year.  We've been long, longtime friends.  And for me, having my Ryder Cup debut with a good friend, a countryman, it was extremely special.  I just feeded off his golf and played great today, as well, and most importantly, Europe got the point.
