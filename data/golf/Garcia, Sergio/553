Q.  Yesterday you said you played like crap.  I guess it was a little better today, right?
SERGIO GARCIA:  What do you think (laughing)?  Yesterday I played better, and today the game was on pretty much the whole day, and it was nice to see.  On this golf course, the way I was playing in these kind of conditions, it was nice to see the way I hit the ball, how many shots I hit close to the pin.  I made a nice couple par putts when I had to.

It was a nice day to have, and hopefully we can have another good one tomorrow.
Q.  What do you need to do tomorrow to win?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Probably one less than the guy that finishes second.  No, I think you shouldn't have a number in there because you never know.  The course is playing tough, and you never know what's going to happen.  Just go out there and try to play like today.  Try to play the best I can, try to shoot the lowest score I can, and see if that's enough.
Q.  You really attacked the par 5s today.  Talk about how you played on those.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, I drove the ball very well on the par 5s.  Unfortunately I thought I hit a perfect drive on 9 but just hit it too far and it just ran through and couldn't get it down there close to the green.  But I still hit it fairly close, to about seven or eight feet, and missed that.

The other par 5s I hit my drives nicely, hit iron shots to the middle of the green and made easy birdies.  That was nice, nice to do.  But not only that, I think I played very well all day long.
Q.  You said before that the time is now to start winning some of these big events.  There's only so many of them in a year.  Mindset going into tomorrow?  I know you're ready to win one of these things.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, I think so.  I think I'm ready to win.  I've just got to go out there and do the same thing, try to keep improving, keep testing myself, and hopefully I'll play well enough to win tomorrow.  It would be nice, but if it doesn't happen, it's not the end of the world.  You always learn from whatever happens.
Q.  Wind conditions out here, really gusty when you guys first teed off and then it died down late afternoon?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, as the day was progressing, it did die a little bit, but not a whole lot.  We were still hitting 9 irons into 17 from 124 yards and things like that.  It was tough out there.  There was quite a lot of wind, and as you say, it was gusting a little bit, and it makes it really tough to pull the right clubs.
