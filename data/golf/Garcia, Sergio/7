Q. It's your first PGA TOUR win since 2017, your first PGA TOUR win since becoming a father.  How much does this one mean to you?
SERGIO GARCIA:   It's great.  It's pretty sweet.  There's no doubt.  I was fortunate enough to win a couple of times in Europe so Azalea could see it.  Now both Azalea and Enzo can see me win here in the U.S., which is amazing.  It's great.  Obviously a lot of hard work, my whole family, Angela, Azalea, Enzo, my family in Spain, everyone around.  It's been tough because I lost two uncles because of COVID, so it's been tough for my dad, but this one was for him.
Q. This game can be a battle even for the best players in the world like yourself.  But you battled back.  You only had one top 10 last season on the PGA TOUR, missed the Playoffs for the second time.  What has been the key to this resurgence?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I think it's just keep believing, keep working hard, just got to get it right there, your mind right.  I think my whole team has been behind me trying to help me in every way they can.  I've also been able to find a couple things here and there that obviously have helped, and it's great.  You know, it feels great to be able to stand there on 18 and just rip a nice draw and hit a great 8-iron like I did and make a putt.  Obviously I want to thank all my sponsors for their support.  It's never easy, and when you're struggling a little bit, it's always tough, but they stayed behind me, and that's why I love them.
