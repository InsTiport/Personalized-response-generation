Q. How was it out there?
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it was a little bit of a lottery.  The wind was all over the place and it was blowing really, really hard, very gusty.  Like what happened on the fourth hole, I had 9-iron to the green -- tend to hit pitching wedge, and hit it 20 yards right of the green and hit 9-iron and hit it five yards short of the green.  That kind of shows you the wind, how much it was blowing and how much it was changing.
Obviously with trees coming down and things like that, we managed to hold on well for those first, however, six holes, which wasn't easy.  I think tomorrow will be a little bit calmer and we can get out there.
