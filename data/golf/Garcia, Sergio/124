 Q. Could you just talk about your round.   
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, no, I'm happy with it. Obviously, under the conditions we played on and to be able to go bogey‑free, I don't know if it's probably my first bogey‑free round here at Augusta. So it was good to do that.   
I would have loved to have made a couple of those birdie putts that I had, but I hit some good putts.  
And it's very difficult when it's this gusty, too. It's hard to figure out the right clubs and you need to get a few breaks and stuff like that.  
   
 Q. A few players have said that this is the toughest Augusta has played. Why is it today on a day like this that you put together such a good round?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I played fairly well, stayed quite patient, and I got a couple decent breaks on a couple holes that helped me salvage par and kept my round going. But it wasn't easy out there, I'll tell you that.  
   
 Q. Do you feel your game is at a place now where you're ready to win one of these majors?  
SERGIO GARCIA: I would love to, yes. I feel like ‑‑ I said this since the beginning of the year ‑‑ I feel like my game is in pretty good shape, I feel like I'm hitting the ball nicely. Even though today wasn't maybe my best ball striking round, I still hit a lot of good shots.   
I just need to keep working hard on my short game and get more confidence in there and if I can manage to do that, then I should be able to do that.
