 Q.  Your thoughts on that opening round?  
SERGIO GARCIA: I'm happy with it.  The conditions were absolutely perfect.  Just a shame, maybe two or three chances on the back nine that could have gone a little bit better.  Other than that, it was good.  I felt like I played quite solid.  Gave myself a lot of chances, a lot of good opportunities, some putts, made some, missed a couple, but overall it was a good round.   
 Q.  Looked slightly frustrated.  Was that the highest score you could have shot?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Probably.  But I wouldn't say frustrated.  I was obviously trying to do my best out there.  I hit two or 3-putts that looked like they weren't going to go in, didn't go in and then I hit a couple that weren't quite as good.  You know, overall, it's a good start of the week.  I know that I'm going to have to shoot around 5- or 6-under every day if I want to have a chance.  So I got five today so hopefully I can keep doing that.   
 Q.  How good is it out there condition-wise?  
ALEXANDER BJÃRK: Yeah, it's perfect.  It was perfect.  Not much wind.  A little bit at the end but really probably, I don't know, like half a club or something like that.  So not much.  So it was nice to see that we were able to take advantage of it.
