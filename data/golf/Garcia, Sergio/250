Q.   How do you assess your day?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know, it was tough.   For some reason I can't seem to find the comfort.   There's just too many shots that I can't really see the shot I want to hit. 
It's difficult.   It wasn't easy out there.   The greens were quite firm and it was a little bit breezy, the wind was swirling quite a bit.   I just can't really feel it. 

Q.   Did you hit the ball pretty well today?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I obviously hit some good shots, but when you don't feel too comfortable and you have doubt some of the shots are difficult to hit, it's difficult to hit good shots.   You're going to hit some bad ones out there and this course is going to punish you when you do that.   So that's the way it is.

Q.   Disappointing first round, you would obviously like to have a couple of strokes back and you're really in this thing, right?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it's a shame because I felt like I was still doing pretty good.   I was 1‑under, obviously I bogeyed 11, but I hit a good shot on 14 when I was 1‑under and then it went over the green and I couldn't get up‑and‑down. 
I missed a short putt on the next and just couldn't really finish it coming in. 
It would have been nice to be able to shoot even par, which I feel like I could have, but that's the way it is. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
SERGIO GARCIA:   You got to keep the scorecard cleaner than that.   Any time you make six bogeys, that's not going to result in a good score. 
The only thing I can do is see if I feel a little bit better out there tomorrow and get some good things going and we'll see how it goes.
