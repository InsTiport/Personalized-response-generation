  Q. Talk about today.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was hard. The course is not getting any easier, but at the same time I got absolutely zero out of my round.   
 I could have shot higher, but the good thing is even like this I'm one shot back and I have a shot tomorrow so that's the positive.  
  
  Q. If I would have told you you weren't going to make a birdie and you were going to be in the final group on Sunday, you could have taken a day off.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: If you would have given me no bogeys, then, yes.   
  
  Q. There you go. Tee to green you played well today other than 18 but --  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, just feel uncomfortable on 18, not really committed to the shot I want to hit and obviously it showed.   
 But, yeah, played good under the conditions. Tough to play when wind is so gusty, left pitch, and it goes right, so it's hard to commit to some of those shots. Sometimes you get too caught up with the wind and you forget about the shot.   
  
  Q. So is there anything to work on or give it up and go home and come back tomorrow?   
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, obviously there are things that would be nice to work on. Not great practicing in this wind but we'll see.   
  
  Q. Good luck to you.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Thank you.
