  Q. Talk about how Vijay played in this tournament.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: I'm glad I got to watch it. That was awesome to watch. I mean, obviously he made -- Vijay made a lot of putts, but to shoot 8-under today under these conditions, with the wind and as firm as the greens were, it's just impressive, and that's the only thing you can say.  
  
  Q. You had said before this round that you're happy you were able to keep yourself in contention. Do you still feel that way?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I mean, it didn't matter what I did today. A lot of things had to happen for me to shoot 8-under to go into a playoff today. It didn't happen early on, and unfortunately when they needed to happen on 9 and 10, I got two huge horseshoes, and that really stopped me a lot.   
 You know, that's the way it goes sometimes, but I'm still happy, still feel like I performed well. Obviously I missed a couple opportunities today that I would like to hit and have a chance on a couple holes. But overall, the only thing you can say, well done to Vijay. He played amazing.  
  
  Q. Your mindset going into next week?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I'm going to relax a little bit. It's been two -- actually been three very, very tough weeks with the PGA and these last two, and I've got next week coming, I've got Ryder Cup coming, TOUR Championship, so I don't want to get drained out before the year ends.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Obviously the greens were extremely firm all day, but the back nine more than anything. You couldn't miss a fairway. The pins were tucked, and as soon as you missed the fairway -- even from the fairway, some pins you couldn't get to. On 14 I hit a great wedge sky high from 160 yards, and I flew it right next to the hole, and it rolled probably 12 yards.   
 You know, if you missed a couple fairways here and there, you were struggling to -- not even to hit it close to the pin, you were struggling to hit the greens. I hit some good shots out of the rough and I couldn't hold the greens.   
 Vijay managed to hit a lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens, and he rolled the ball beautifully today.  
  
  Q. What was it like watching Vijay rolling those --  
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was awesome. I mean, with all due respect, it was great to watch. It was something that I don't think you guys are going to realize how good that was because you weren't playing and you don't know how tough the course was playing. Obviously he played very good, and then when he got a big lead after 11, you know, he started playing a little bit more conservative you could see, but he was still hitting the greens, and then he started rolling some bombs. It was good to watch.   
  
  Q. He's kind of turned the FedEx thing into a one-man show now with back-to-back wins, and mathematically I think you might be the only guy that has a chance to catch him, and you've got to basically go win-win, I think.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it's hard. When Vijay is playing like this and rolling the ball like he's rolling it, it's hard to get him because we all know how good a ball-striker he is, and when he goes on a roll like this like he's gone on these past couple weeks with his putting and everything, it becomes quite difficult. I don't see him finishing outside the Top 10 in the next two tournaments.  
  
  Q. Did you play here before they modified the greens?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No.  
  
  Q. They used to be real humpy. It's hard to imagine making anything of that length --  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, I mean, last year was the first year I was here.  
  
  Q. Are you looking forward to another draw with him?   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, definitely. He's a good friend of mine, so it's like when Tiger is playing well. You want to beat him, but you've got to give it up to him. It's awesome to watch. You're watching history, and to have the chance of playing and battling it out with these kind of guys, you know, it's great. I felt like I did well today, I started great, and you know, unfortunately I missed a couple, two good putts on 9 and 10, and those things could have gone in. Unfortunately they horseshoed like hell, and it puts me in a very difficult position to try to get back into the tournament and try to win it. But that's the way it is.   
  
  Q. How were the greens today?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yesterday they got firmer already, but today they were extremely firm.  
  
  Q. More breeze today, right?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, it was similar. It was fairly similar. The greens were just much, much firmer. Any time you're hitting a wedge or a sand wedge and you can't stop it within 25 feet, you know that the greens are -- they're getting to the point.
