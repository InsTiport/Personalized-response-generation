 Q.  How do you feel about your game today?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I obviously played okay but I didn't play as well as the first two days.  Unfortunately just nothing wanted to happen for me.   
I hit some good putts that didn't want to go in, and then I wasn't as fluid, as smooth as the first two days, and because of that, my distance control wasn't as good.  I wasn't hitting the ball as close to the pin, and you know, it's one of those things that happens.   
At least it was a good mental test on some of the things I'm working on.  I stayed patient.  Even though I could have kind of given up, I kept my cool and I tried to make something happen.  At least we made an eagle on 14, and would have loved to shoot probably three or four shots better, but that's what it was.   
 Q.  You are seven shots behind the leader.  You think you can still win this tournament or it's impossible?  
SERGIO GARCIA: No, nothing is impossible.  Obviously if I go crazy tomorrow and shoot 9- or 10-under, something like that, and the leaders don't go too low, it can happen.  But a lot of things have to line up.   
So it's most likely that I won't win but it doesn't mean that I'm not going to give it my best shot and try to play as well as I can tomorrow, shoot the best round possible and see where that leaves us.
