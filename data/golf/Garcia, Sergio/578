(From taped interview)

Q.  Happy with your round?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, I mean, I am happy because I knew I had to shoot something like that to get back into this tournament and have a chance tomorrow.  Unfortunately, it could have been really good today.

But it's a shame, you know.  The course, believe it or not, is not playing that easy.  The greens are quite firm.  Some of the pins are pretty tricky.  If you hit good shots, you can get a lot of looks.  That's what I did today.  Unfortunately, I made a couple very bad bogeys and it cost me a little bit.
Q.  What is your mindset tomorrow?
SERGIO GARCIA:  We'll see.  Depends on the day.  If it doesn't rain, it's not supposed to, the course is going to keep getting firm.  The greens were getting nice and firm at the end.

It's not going to be that easy.  Maybe if we get a bit of wind, it will be nice.  If not, you're going to realize although it's not playing easy, you're still going to have to play some birdies.  You got a lot of par 4s you're hitting wedges in.  These guys can play, so they're going to make some birdies there.  You're going to have to do the same thing.

I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
Q.  Is this the kind of course you have to put on the pedal early; if you don't get a couple of birdies early, you'll be out of it?
SERGIO GARCIA:  No, I wouldn't say so.  I think you can get it going any time if you're hitting the ball nicely.  But definitely the first probably seven holes, you have some good birdie opportunities there.  Unfortunately today, I birdied the tough holes and I didn't birdie the easy holes on the first seven.  I was like 2, 5 and 7, I didn't birdie those, but I birdied the other ones.

I think if you can get it going a little bit there, it's great.  If not, you know you're going to have some birdie chances and a couple eagle chances if you're playing well.  You've just got to be patient out there.
Q.  Michelle Wie is going to turn pro next year.
SERGIO GARCIA:  I heard something about that.
Q.  Good for golf?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Definitely, yeah.  Anything like that, it can only be good for golf.  She's a wonderful player.  I think she's been doing a great job.  Just has to keep getting better and better.  Whatever helps the game of golf, it's always welcome.
Q.  You turned pro at a very young age.  What would you tell her if she asked some advice of what to expect in the next year?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, I didn't turn pro that early, not as early as her.  I think probably the only thing I could really tell her is to not burn out early on.  She's a good player, so she's going to have every chance to play any tournament if she wants.  The first couple years, it's always tough because you want to play a lot, get yourself a good status.  But you got to control your scheduling a little bit.

I'm sure she'll do a good job.  She's a smart girl.  She'll know how to handle that.
Q.  Did you play too many?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I think the first year I did, yeah.  Unfortunately, the first year I didn't pretty much have any rest.  That cost me a little bit.
