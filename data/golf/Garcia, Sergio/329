 Q.   You equalled the course record with a 64, but nine birdies, two eagles, two bogeys and a triple.   Explain yourself.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I wish I could (laughing).   I don't know, I played very, very well, and after yesterday, for having some weeks off after The Ryder Cup, obviously I was a bit disappointed yesterday.  
But today I started really, really well.   I played great on the front nine and I hit a lot of good shots.   I made a lot of good birdies.   
Putted pretty nicely and then I started with another two birdies on 10 and 11, and got going, and all of a sudden, I kind of lost it a little bit with the putter, missed a couple short putts for pars, and then I made a bomb on 14 for eagle.   I made a good birdie on the next.   
And then I just probably hit the worst shot I hit all day.   I just didn't commit to the shot I wanted to hit.   Unfortunately took myself out of it, made a nice triple on 16, but finished with two really good swings on the last two.   
I got lucky on the last, my drive.   I hit it five yards left of where I wanted but got a very good bounce off the rocks and then hit a very, very nice 5‑wood and a great putt.  
   
 Q.   Emotionally, how is a round like that when it's going up‑and‑down like a yo‑yo, and one minute you're playing and the next minute you've made a triple.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I was trying to be as calm as possible.   Obviously I wasn't very happy about my shot on 16.   But I accepted it and I thought, you know, if you can make one birdie in the next two, it's still a good round, you shoot 6‑under, still a good, solid round.   
Like I said, coming back from a long break, so trying to get some good vibrations going and I managed to finish better than that.   So happy with that.  
   
 Q.   Are the flags fairly friendly today?   Because you're not the only one that's going low?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, it's the kind of course that if you drive the ball well, which I did today, if you drive the ball well, you can make some birdies and an eagle here and there.   
Obviously we have 14 and 18 with front tees, so you can get to those in two.   Then we have 15, front tee, too, so you can drive that one.   So if you hit good shots, you can put a good number on it.   But you still have to hit the shots obviously.   
I have had a couple rounds where you make a double or eagle here and there but not like it happened on the back nine today.   Happy about the way I played for most of the holes and hopefully we can keep doing a lot of the good things that I did today.  
   
 Q.   You must be particularly pleased with the way that you finished given how it could have unraveled a lot of very good work earlier?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, yes, I guess so.   I think that everything was kind of going quite smoothly until 12, and then missed a couple short putts.   Came back nicely from that with an eagle and a birdie, and then unfortunately I threw it away on 16 and somehow I managed to get it back again on 17 and 18.   
So you know, a little bit lucky on 18 obviously with the tee shot but the 6‑iron on 17, which is not the easiest pin, and then the 5‑wood on the last were really nice.   
   
 Q.   What was the key to sort of turning your tournament around today, because obviously something clicked?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, I hit the ball nicely.   I drove the ball very well.   I hit a lot of good shots.   I gave myself a lot of good looks at birdies.   I managed to roll some in.   That was pretty much it.   
Obviously I still feel the rust from these last seven weeks without competing, and you know, I still need to sharpen that up.   But it feels lies to be able to shoot a good round.  
   
 Q.   And thoughts for the weekend, you've given yourself a platform with a lot of your Ryder Cup colleagues and some of the biggest names in the game right now.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, it's nice to be able to do what I did today and come back after not playing very well yesterday.   So that's good to see.   
Hopefully I'll be able to do something similar on the weekend and see if we can manage to have a chance.   Obviously the leaders, I'm expecting them to be easily in double digits today, somewhere around 11 or 12, at least.   So we'll see how far we are.   
   
 Q.   It's not often that you card a triple‑bogey and get close to breaking a close record, and in this case, equalling one.   What goes through your mind after that at 16 and how do you put it out of it to carry on your round, because we've seen in the past sometimes that can just break a round to pieces; in some senses, a little bit luckier that it came late.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I don't know, I think that the main thing for me was that obviously I wasn't happy with the shot I hit on 16.   I wasn't happy with my triple for sure.   
But you know, I guess it was done.   I guess it was already done because I hit a bad shot.   If I would have hit it straight at it, I would have been 15 yards short; it probably would have rattled me a little bit more.   
I just thought, you're still 5‑under, let's see if you can make maybe one or two birdies coming in, it's still a good round, 6‑, 7‑under after the big layoff that I had.   So that was my thinking, and I managed to put a couple really good swings coming in.  
   
 Q.   Is it a big difference, your eyesight?   Do you see things sharper?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   A little bit.   Not immensely, but a little bit.   Mainly the main reason was‑‑ I mean, it's not like I couldn't play the way I was before.   Mainly the reason was with contact lenses, I was feeling very, very uncomfortable, so it was either do nothing, or get the LASIK surgery and kind of get rid of it.   I decided to go with it.   
I'm still kind of getting used to it a little bit.
