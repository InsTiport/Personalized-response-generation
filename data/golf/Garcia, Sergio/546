Q.  It's another point.  José Maria, did you ever feel anything other than comfortable in that match once you got into it?

JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  Well, I felt comfortable yesterday, I felt the same way today playing with Sergio.  We had a good start.  I think that was very important.  And then we had a good stretch of holes where we made a few crucial putts and they didn't, and I think that was the key to the match.
Q.  How much difference did it make to the freedom you could play with, that you went into today's play two points up already?

SERGIO GARCIA:  I don't think it was that, I think it was feeling comfortable.  José played amazing today.  I mean, I don't think he missed a fairway.

JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  Shock.

SERGIO GARCIA:  No, it was awesome.  A couple of the holes that I was pretty much out, like 13, he hit a great drive and a great 4 iron into there.

You know, we got a little bit lucky because they missed a couple putts that could have kind of leveled the match a little bit.  But I think we still played very solid in these difficult weather conditions, and we still made a good bunch of birdies.
