 Q.  Talk about your day.  
SERGIO GARCIA: Tough day.  Obviously I didn't have it today.  But I fought as hard as I could with what I had.  And obviously proud of the way I stayed in it.  It would have been very easy to kind of lose it and go home.  But I fought as hard as I could and a couple of nice birdies on 17, and got up and down on the last two of the day.   
 Q.  Talk about the weekend ahead of you.  
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I have to play better than today.  The way I played today I have nothing -- I have no chance.  But obviously -- you can shoot scores on these golf courses if you play well, but you have to.  If you don't we can see what it can do to you, and we saw what it did to me again.   
 Q.  Going into the weekend, what's the biggest part of your game?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Obviously I need to drive the ball better like I did yesterday, not like I did today.  But a bit of everything.  But obviously I hit four or five poor drives that cost me a lot.
