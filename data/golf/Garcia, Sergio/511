   SERGIO GARCIA:  It is not a bad round but it was a nice way of throwing a good round in the trash. Two bad reads in the last three. The holes are playing tough. It's really hot. You constantly have to clean the sweat off your arms and hands and 15 seconds later you are sweating again and it makes things tough. The greens were pretty receptive and playing nicely. There were so birdie holes out there but some tough ones to get through. 
 I played pretty good and hit some good tee shots. Overall it was pretty good.
