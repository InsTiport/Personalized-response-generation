Q.   You get off running, he had some chances, missed it.   The back nine everything started going his way.   What was your take on how this day played out?
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, I think we both played solid.   I think that I started very nicely.   Then I got to 3â€‘up after 8, and then he started making some really good putts, 9, 10, 11, with me inside of him almost every hole.
He just put some good pressure on me.   I feel like I held him nicely.   It's just a shame, you know, the putts on 10, 14 and 15. 
But he played really well.   He made some really good birdies coming in.   And that's all you can do, I guess.

Q.   A game of sportsmanship.   What was your thinking on the 7th green?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Just about that.   I feel like unfortunately the game lately hasn't been what it should be.   I think that we are gentlemen.   That's the key thing in this game of golf.   I felt guilty.   I felt guilty that my drop on 6 took so long.   I felt like if I would have been in his position I would have been uncomfortable waiting so long to hit my birdie putt.   So I just thought I have to do something.   I have to do something to make sure that I feel good with myself.   And I had the opportunity on 7 to give a nice half.   It wasn't like my putt was a foot and he had to make a 15 or 16 footer.   I still had a four or five footer.   At least I can leave here feeling good, even though that I lost.   And that's all there is to it.
