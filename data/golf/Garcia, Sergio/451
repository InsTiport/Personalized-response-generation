  Q. Your thoughts on the course this year?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: It looks good. It's a little different than last year. Obviously this year they overseeded the greens. The course looks in great shape and looking forward to playing it.   
 Obviously it's a tough course, we know that, and you have to be very patient throughout the week.   
  
  Q. You have played in these Pro-Ams quite a bit now, have you ever gotten a tip from any of the amateurs that you've played with or anything fun that you've seen out of them a little bit?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Not really. Sometimes they tell you what not to do.   
 No, usually they are good fun, a good group of people. For example, today, they played great, and it was good fun. But no, they are enjoyable. Pro-Ams are a lot easier than some people might think.   
  
  Q. What interested you in playing in the Honda Classic this year and coming to play here?   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Well, I played here last year and I enjoyed the course. I think the course, it's a really good course to play on, and to get something going in your swing and your game.   
 Obviously it fits on the schedule perfectly, so both things kind of worked perfectly for it.   
  
  Q. Everybody is looking for a big, big year out of you this year. Do you feel that coming, too? You've obviously built up a lot of momentum here lately.   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Well, I hope so. I'm looking forward to it. I had a good season last season, and I'm looking forward to keep going in the same direction. It's never easy to maintain the level, but you know, that's what we practice for and that's what we are going to try.  
  
  Q. Are you going to shake anything up in your schedule leading up to the Masters?   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: What do you mean?   
  
  Q. Do anything differently leading up to it?   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Differently than?   
  
  Q. Than what you've done in the past.   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Well, I'm going to play Houston this year. I heard that they set up the course nicely there the week before the Masters, so looking forward to see how that works, and hopefully I'll play good at the Masters.  
  
  Q. '96, going into the British Open, do you remember Tom Lehman and holding the Jug?   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: That was great, as a 16-year-old, knowing that one of your dreams is to win that championship, it was like a dream come true. I was more afraid of not dropping it than anything else.
