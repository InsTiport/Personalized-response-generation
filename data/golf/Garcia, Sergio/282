  SERGIO GARCIA:   I think overall it was a good week and I would have liked to putt better today, but overall, not too disappointed.   I was a little bit tired throughout the week but looking forward to rest a little bit. 

Q.   Tomorrow is another great day in Munich sports, especially you have been to the Champions League final in London and Wembley; what do you think? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I think it's great, it's a great coach, a very nice person, so it's going to be interesting to see how everything evolves here in Bayern Munich with him and I know he's very excited about it, so it should be interesting to watch because they have a great team so it will be interesting to watch how they get used to it.

Q.   Did you have problems because of the Wayne jersey in Wembley back home?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Not at all, I watched final, it was very, very exciting, I think both teams played great, and it was nice to see Bayern win.   Obviously my girlfriend is a Bayern fan and I was happy for her and I was pulling for Bayern. 

Q.   Your verdict on this week, please? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I don't know, it's hard to say.   I think as probably as flat as I feel energyâ€‘wise, mentally, not too bad.   I feel like for most of the week, I played quite decent.   I obviously didn't hole the amount of putts I need to hole to try to win, but you know, overall, I think it was a solid week, and I'm excited about having a little rest now.
