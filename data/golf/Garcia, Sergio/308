  SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, today, even though it was playing tougher, different wind, a bit hard, a bit more intensity in the wind, I definitely played much better than yesterday. 
So I'm hoping that, you know, it doesn't go good round, bad round, good round, bad round.   Hopefully it goes good, bad, good, good. 

Q.   Michael Thompson played well, too, he shot 67.   Must have been a must day out there. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, he played very solid.   Obviously he didn't really miss a lot of shots.   He hit some really good putts.   And we both played fairly well. 
I obviously struggled a little bit with the wind on some shots that I hit well and misâ€‘clubbed because of it but other than that, for the most part I hit the ball fairly well and I'm happy with that.
