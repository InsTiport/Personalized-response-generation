Q.  Feeling better about today as opposed to yesterday?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, yesterday I had a great round going and I threw it away with a couple of bad decisions coming in.

Today I felt like    I felt like I played pretty decent.  I felt like I played well, but I just couldn't make a putt really.  Twice I hit good drives and I just missed the fairway by a foot and it was unplayable.  Tough breaks there.  But it's just a shame.  I just couldn't make any putts, and that was pretty much the end of the story.
Q.  You're pleased to be around for the weekend, I would think.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, 1 over is fine.  The good thing is the way this course is playing, and the weekend, hopefully it doesn't rain, it's just going to be tough.

So I think if I manage to shoot 5  or 6 under par tomorrow, get myself back in there and have a 5 or 6 on Sunday, I still have a chance.  I mean, I feel like I'm playing well.  It's just a matter of rolling a couple of putts in and getting some nice confidence.
Q.  Obviously it's out there; Furyk is doing it, so the number is out there.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, it is there.  I mean, you have to play well, because the greens are firm, but you hit the fairways and you can still manage to get around.  You have big par 5s that you can get to, with my length I can, and a couple of par 4s.  So if you get it going a little bit, you can post a good number, and I've done it before here, so I know what's going on.  It's just a matter of getting it done.
Q.  When the putter is going like this, what do you do?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Not much.  You just forget about it a little bit.
