 Q. Thoughts on the day? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, tough day obviously but I felt like even though in the tough conditions, I felt like I was in good control in my shot on 11, and then you know, I guess it was bad timing on 13. A guy shouted on the top of my backswing and made a poor tee shot and made double and I struggled a little bit and that rattled me a little bit and that took a lot of momentum out. I just came off a good birdie on 12. That's harsh and that's pretty much what happened. It was three guys, must have been drunk, like always. 

 Q. On the top of your backswing? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah. 

 Q. Thoughts for tomorrow, you have a bit of ground to make up, do you think you can make up the shots? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, we'll see what the weather conditions are like. Obviously both Graeme and Ross are playing well and shooting anything under par today was a great round, and that's why I'm disappointing because I had it there and I felt like I was doing well and I had a couple birdie opportunities coming in towards the end and unfortunately that double there on 13, put me a little behind the 8-ball and, you know, that's the way it goes. 
 But you know, I still, want to get a good finish here and get as many points as possible.
