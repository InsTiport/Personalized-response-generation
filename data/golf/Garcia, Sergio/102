 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SERGIO GARCIA: Not really.  Obviously it was a terrible day.  Just a combination of not playing really well and really not -- didn't really get anything going.  So at least, like you said, we finished with a couple of nice birdies.  But it's a shame, because it was a day that if you played decent, you could shoot 2, 3, 4-under, and that would have been a really nice round.  And unfortunately I just didn't have it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SERGIO GARCIA: A little bit of everything.  I didn't hit many fairways.  Even the good drives I hit, I didn't hit the fairways.  My iron play wasn't great.  And the birdie chances I had early on I didn't make them.  And then I started hitting some bunkers and they got tougher as the day went on.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, if I play like today, definitely not.  But hopefully I'll play better.  I'll play more like the last couple of holes, and try to shoot a good round to get us back into the tournament and try to have a hell of a weekend.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SERGIO GARCIA: No, no.
