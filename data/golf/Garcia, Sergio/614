SERGIO GARCIA:  Nobody seemed like they wanted to win.  We were trying hard and just couldn't play well.

I had a good finish.  I wanted to win, and that's what counts.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:  No, I drove it in the fairway, a little bit short and sprinted back to the front of the green.  I had a long putt, about a 25 footer or something like that.

I hit it just a little right of the hole, probably about 18 feet, and it looked like    it looked like they cut the greens.  I ran it by seven or eight feet.  I hit my putt soft and then I still ran it by about three feet, and he made his and I made mine.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:  You'd rather win it better than that, but you've got to have some luck throughout the week.  You've got to have a bit of luck in this one, when you don't play well and you somehow manage to get through.  So hopefully I can keep doing that.
