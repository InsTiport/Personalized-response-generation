  Q. Tells us how you hit the ball. You said you didn't think you deserved to be 3-under?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, not at all. I was hitting the ball very poorly.  
  
  Q. You started off on the first five holes --   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Didn't matter. Probably shot, obviously, made a good birdie on 10. I made a great shot on 11.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, but I know when I'm swinging well and when not. And obviously we're here, so if I didn't hit the ball I was doing something else. But I can feel like -- not smooth, my swing, I can't feel it going the right way. Everything seems to be like -- feels like I'm trying to steer everything to make it go the right way and it didn't go the right way today.  
  
  Q. Is there a certain ball playing pattern to the misses or --  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Anything goes.  
  
  Q. Are you happy with your score or is it just kind of --  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, no, I mean I can't be happy with anything that's better than today. The way I played, obviously 71 is not that bad a score, but when you're 3-under and you have to go tomorrow. The course is playing the easiest than it is going to play all week. The greens were soft because of the rain last night. And there wasn't a lot of wind. If you play halfway decent you are going to shoot 65, 68, 69.   
  
  Q. Do you equate this kind of situation you're in now to something that you've had in the past and how did you get yourself out of it?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: I don't know. I think it's been a while since I hit the ball that badly. But, I don't know, I'll find a way.   
  
  Q. You said the change doesn't feel right. Can you pinpoint anything in particular?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No.
