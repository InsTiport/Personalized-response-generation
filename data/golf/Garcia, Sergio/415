  Q. You ran into a buzz saw today. Ian made a lot of putts out there, it was a tough match.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I mean, I obviously didn't play well. The first four or five holes were really stupid.   
 But, you know, at the end of the day he played awesome. He made everything he looked at and I just didn't. So that's how it is. It's been a good week. We still have tomorrow to go.   
  
  Q. Were the conditions kind of tough with the rain?   
 SERGIO GARCIA: That would have been fine. It was beyond that.
