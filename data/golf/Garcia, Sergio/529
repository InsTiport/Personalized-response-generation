   SERGIOA GARCIA:  1999 was the last and first time I was here. The course has changed quite a bit. It is a lot tougher than it was in those days. The rough has grown up and it is consistent and thick and hopefully I can have another good week this week. It was okay out there today. 
Yesterday was much windier. But I have always enjoyed the wind and playing the different shots. That's one of the reason's I enjoy playing The Open as you always get a different wind there. It is good fun. 

 Q.  Good field this week? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Definitely. The tournament is a good tournament and you can see that by the players that are here and the quality of the course. It will be a great show for those watching. 

 Q.  What are the goals this year? 
  GARCIA:  Just keep improving, hopefully win a Major. If not then just keep improving my game overall. 

 Q.  And it would be good to get off to a nice start this week? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  I played last week and it was not too bad. It is getting better and better slowly and it would be nice to have a good week here in Qatar.
