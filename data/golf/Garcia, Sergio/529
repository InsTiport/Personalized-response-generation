  Q.  On the course conditions?   
 SERGIO GARCIA:  It wasn't easy.  The greens were really firm.  Had a hard time getting comfortable out there.  It was quite gusty.  Had a couple of wrong clubs because of the winds.   
 The speed of the greens was what to expect.  They were quite firm.  Quite tough.   
 It's going to be a very tough week.  It's not supposed to rain so it will be harder and firmer.
