Q.   What were your thoughts on the streak that Bubba put together on the back nine?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, not only the back nine, I thought he played great the rest of the day.   He drove the ball really, really good, very far.   His iron play was extremely good. 
So he played extremely well throughout the whole two rounds.   And that's why he is where he is.

Q.   That streak of five birdies, was that particularly impressive with the wind?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Everything was impressive, not only that.   It just happened.

Q.   How difficult is this wind today?
SERGIO GARCIA:   It's quite windy.
