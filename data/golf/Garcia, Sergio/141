 Q.  That was an incredible match to watch.  What was it like to be a part of?  
SERGIO GARCIA: It was amazing.  Obviously I played Phil many times at the Ryder Cup.  I think we played once in singles at Oakland Hills.   
It was a great match.  Obviously he played well.  He definitely putted very well.  I think I played extremely well.  Putted very nicely.   
A couple of shots here and there, couple turning points on 12, hit a great tee, almost goes in, he makes the putt.   
Next hole I lip out from the bunker, he makes the putt for par.  It's tough but it was a great match.   
 Q.  So as the takeaway with a half point, do you look at it as a negative that you didn't get the whole point or a positive that you were able to scratch a half point for Europe?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Definitely a negative.  I was out there to get a point, not to get half a point.  I tried to deliver, unfortunately I was just a little bit short.  But while I am still very proud of the way I played, the way I handled myself all week, obviously a lot of matches.   
Yesterday just unfortunately I went on a little break with my putter for six holes and I played as well as I played yesterday.  I made seven birdies missing everything yesterday.  That point would have been huge and unfortunately Martin and I couldn't deliver it.  The Americans they have definitely played very well.
