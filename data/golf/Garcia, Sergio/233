 Q.   Sergio, how do you classify that?   Is that like a dream run?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   It was definitely a dream back nine.   I felt like I started well.   I hit some good shots early on, missed a couple good birdie chances.   
Then I obviously got a little bit lucky on the front nine.   I hit three bad tee shots on 4, 8, and 9, and I was able to have a shot at the green and made a couple good up and downs.   
Then back nine was, I don't know, I just started hitting good shots, rolling the putts in, and everything seemed to happen.   I was just enjoying it as much as I could.  
   
 Q.   Is this any continuation from The Open where you played so well?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   I wouldn't say from The Open.   I think it's just a continuation of the whole year.   It's been a solid year for me.   
Obviously, I know that everybody, when they look at a year, they look at wins, and I only had the one in Qatar, but if you look at the way I've been playing, I've had a lot of high finishes.   I've been very close to winning probably two or three tournaments.   Unfortunately, that hasn't happened.   
Like I always say, the most important thing for me is to keep getting better and keep putting myself in situations to try to win tournaments.   It feels great to be able to do it.  
   
 Q.   What happens to you when you're going, okay, you just made three birdies in a row, then you made a fourth, then you made a fifth, then you made a sixth?   What happens inside you?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   To tell you the truth, I don't know.   I felt quite comfortable throughout that whole stretch, and obviously I was fortunate enough to hit some really good shots on tough holes.   
13‑‑ I mean, the pin on 12 wasn't that easy because there was a little bit of breeze from the left.   But 13, 15, obviously they're holes that maybe you don't expect to birdie that often.   
And then when I hit a little bit farther, I just kept rolling them in.   It was one of those moments where you can see the lines, you can see everything, and everything feels smooth.   
The only thing I was worried about was on 18 on my second shot, not to flush it too much with the wedge and hit it over.   I came out a little bit of it, and I gave myself a putt and was able to roll it in.
