 Q.  How favorable were conditions out there this afternoon?  
SERGIO GARCIA: This morning, I think, the weather was absolutely perfect.  It's been perfect every day.  It looks like it's going to be the same throughout the week.  It's great.   
The golf course is nice.  The greens actually held up better than I thought in the afternoon.  I expected them to be a little bit bumpier, but they did quite well.  The weather was just amazing.   
 Q.  How pleased are you with a 66?  
SERGIO GARCIA: I'm happy with it.  Obviously there was some chances there that maybe I could have taken care of, but you can't really make them all, or at least some days you can't.   
At the end of the day, I played nicely.  I putted quite well, made some good putts here and there.  It was a good solid round and excited to hopefully do more of the same over the weekend.   
 Q.  Is there a particular highlight in the round that you can pick out?  
SERGIO GARCIA: I don't know.  Difficult to say.  I think the birdie on 5 was really nice because I had a bit of a mud ball just in the right rough, and you never know if the ball is going to do exactly what you think it should do or not.  I was able to hit a really good shot there and make that birdie putt.  That was a nice birdie.   
 Q.  How good was it to see so many people out there supporting you?  
SERGIO GARCIA: It was really good, obviously.  Standing ovation for the Italian people to come and support.  It was so many people watching and supporting us.  It was really fun to see.   
 Q.  Does that inspire, that support?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, always.  Of course.  We play no matter if it's big crowds or maybe not so big.  Obviously, when you see the amount of people that come and watch you play and stuff like that, it makes it extra special for sure.
