SERGIO GARCIA: Just to get a bit more confirmation.  If I'm comfortable with what I'm doing, even if I get it wrong, I usually don't.  So it's a little bit of a combo, I guess.  But obviously probably a tiny bit more under these conditions, yeah.
Q. (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, it feels better than it felt when I did it.  Obviously it took a good amount of pills to make it feel better and a little bit of treatment.  And it's warm at the moment.  So I want to see how it feels tonight.  But I'm going to go to the physio track and make sure I get some work on it because it still feels a little bit sore around it.  So we'll see.  Hopefully it will be fine.
Q. (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA: It felt -- it didn't feel good.  It felt like -- because I hit it backwards and I was very weak, very weak position.  And it felt like the muscles on it, it felt like one -- like they just went on top of each other.  So it didn't feel good at all.
Q. (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA: No, I mean obviously I am not happy about it because I almost screwed up my British Open.  Fortunately for me I didn't.  But obviously it's not what you want to do.  But sometimes you're out there and you're trying your hardest, and when you can't do it, it gets a little frustrating.  We've all had those moments.
Q. (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA: It definitely cheered me up a little bit, but at the same time I didn't know if I was going to be able to finish the round, and I was very concerned about it.  But obviously it did help but it was still a bit of a question mark.
Q. (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA: On the next tee.  On the 5th tee.
