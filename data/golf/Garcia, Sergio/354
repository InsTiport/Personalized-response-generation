 Q.   What are your thoughts on that match today?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   It wasn't great.   I mean, Tom unfortunately played poorly, and I played poorly but a little less.   So I got fortunate early on, I got in front, and then he just couldn't get back.   
Obviously he didn't play very good at all, but I just got fortunate.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on playing in these kind of conditions?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Hopefully they get better.   We still have a few hours so hopefully it will get a little bit better, because it's never nice to play in the rain.   But the rain might help me.
