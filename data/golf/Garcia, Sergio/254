 Q.   Making that putt on the 18th green, it really keeps you in the ballgame going into Sunday?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, you could tell.   You could tell after 17 that it was nice to make that one and not finish bogeyâ€‘bogey.   You know, on what was a tough day again, a lot of wind, the greens obviously firmer every day, a little bit faster.   But obviously very happy with the way it went.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned the bogey at 17.   Did you catch a wind gust on that two and a half footer?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, it was just a bad putt.   I was uncomfortable with it.   It was into the grain, and I just couldn't get comfortable with it.   I got really, really tight, and I just pulled it.   At least I made the one on 18, which was good.  
   
 Q.   It's a long tournament, there's going to be bogeys made out there.   But on the whole you have to be happy with this round because I thought conditions were difficult.   Did the greens get faster?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Definitely.   They were faster and firmer than yesterday.   Every time you missed the fairway today it was difficult to hold the greens, even with a lob wedge in your hands.   Yeah, I think even though the guys scored fairly well, I thought that it played a little bit tougher, and I was happy to break 70.
