Q.   You said during the Pro-Am that you are having a hard time concentrating; how would you describe the way you felt out there today? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, it wasn't easy.   Obviously it was a little bit better.   But you know, we are slowly getting better, which is important. 

Q. How pleased are you with the reaction you got on the first tee from the fans? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   It was great.   It was amazing.   I've always been very fortunate with fans all over the world, not only here in Europe but I've always been very, very lucky with that and I'm very thankful for it.

Q. Along those lines, you're someone who likes to play along with the fans outside the ropes.   With the reception that you got after you got off the first tee, were you able to get back into your normal rhythm or did it feel different out there for you today? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Obviously it probably felt a little bit different.   But you know, I tried, and I think I was very fortunate to be paired with two friends of mine so they could help me get along a little bit easier.   But you know, for the most part it was pretty good. 

Q. At what point were you able to exhale out there and get back into the golf rhythm? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know, I tried through the whole round, there were moments.   Like I said, for the most part, I felt pretty good and I tried to play the best I could. 
I feel like people support me everywhere I go, obviously in Europe, and I'm very thankful for that.   It was great to get a welcome like that. 

Q. Are you pleased with your decision to carry on and play here? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yes, I would say so.   Like I said yesterday, I think that the tournament wasn't the problem of it.   I did it myself.   I felt like I needed to support the Tour and the tournament as much as I could, because it's a wonderful tournament and you know, it deserves the best players in the world.

Q. Have you had any chance to contact Tiger Woods yet?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Unfortunately not.   I mean, we talked to Mark Steinberg, and he said that they are moving forward.   But if I manage to talk to him, perfect; if not, I'll definitely see him at the U.S. Open and we can talk face-to-face. 

Q. And are you aware that the rumpus has rumbled on today with George O'Grady and some comments he made in a television interview today? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   I didn't hear -- I mean, I've been told about it.   Obviously I was playing so I didn't hear it.   But you know, I think it's unfortunate.
