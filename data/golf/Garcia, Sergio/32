Q. Sergio, another solid match today with the win.  Talk about the match today.
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, no, it was great.  Obviously difficult conditions again.  Very windy, probably even windier than yesterday.  I was very happy the way I played.  I drove the ball really, really well.  I hit a lot of good iron shots.  I only missed one or two greens at the most on these conditions.  Got off to a good start and kept giving myself chances, kept putting pressure on Andrew, and I was able to finish on top.
Q. What part of the game does the wind out here on this golf course really affect?  I heard a lot about the putting, it affects a lot of putts out here maybe?
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, putting it obviously affects, because if you're hitting a 7-iron up on difficult conditions you can hit it five yards left of the hole or something like that, and it's still a good shot.  But putting if the wind moves it a little bit, it's the difference between making the putt and missing it.
It obviously affects that quite a bit.  But on this golf course you have to do everything well.  You have to drive the ball well, because if you do that it gives a lot of good options to be aggressive on your second shots.  If you don't, then the greens, where the pins are and stuff, they're not that easy to get to.  So it's important to do step by step everything well.
Q. You put yourself in a great position to advance to the knockout round.  Talk about your mentality for your match tomorrow.
SERGIO GARCIA: Same thing, just got to go out there and play well again, try to win my match.  It's as simple as that.  Nothing else will do for me.  And that's what I'm going to try to do, go out there, be confident, play the best that I can play and hopefully that will be good enough to get into the round of 16.
