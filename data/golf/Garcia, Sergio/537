Q.  Guys, I suppose we should have expected that.  Phenomenal record together and on your own in these foursomes.  I'm sure people want to know, Sergio, what is the key?

SERGIO GARCIA:  I don't know.  I guess, as I said, good partners help.  I think Luke and myself, we just make a really good couple, and unfortunately it's because on this course he just hits the drives, hits it down the middle.  I somehow get it around the hole and he just taps it in.  It works perfect.
Q.  Except on 16, of course.  That was a regulation little birdie, wasn't it, Luke?

LUKE DONALD:  Well, it always looked like a 4, actually.  We were never worried.  Sergio hit a great third shot.  I didn't really hit a very good layup, and he gave me a chance to make that putt, and what an arena to make a putt.

That was probably the loudest roar I've ever heard on a golf course, so that was pretty special.
