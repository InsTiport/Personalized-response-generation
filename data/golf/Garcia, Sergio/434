  Q. We're here with Sergio Garcia who posted a second consecutive 64. Now you're headed to Sunday definitely in contention. How do you feel heading into the final round?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Oh, I played good yesterday and today. A little weak last couple of holes. Made a good 4 on the last -- hit a weak ball on 17.   
 Other than that, it was good. I hit a lot of good shots. I hit it pretty close. I made a couple good putts here and there and I was -- it was a fairly easy 64, you could say.  
  
  Q. You said you came here to kind of recapture some of your game that you may have lost in the last few weeks. Looks like you've done that.   
 How important is it to capture a win again?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I wouldn't go that far. I wouldn't go that far. There's still some -- like the shot I hit on 18. I don't like to see those kind of shots. I'm still trying to get better and, you know, this afternoon is going to be a good test and hopefully I can be up to the challenge and see if I can get a win.  
  
  Q. Good luck.  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Thank you.
