 Q. That must have been a frustrating way to end a tough day out there. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it was definitely tough. Totally different wind. The course played much different. But I just didn't play well. I hit three very poor shots and cost me quite a bit. Funny enough, decent on the last, wasn't that bad. I was just trying to cut it a little bit with the wind and actually hit it too good and hit it dead straight. I guess not much you can do. 

 Q. You and a lot of others. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I mean, it's a tough hole to finish which it issue with, because you know, the wind is into off the left and obviously all of the water is on the left because if you block it right, you don't have much of a shot. 
 Tried to put a decent shot in it, and actually hit it too well and the wind just didn't move it at all. 

 Q. Are you seeing any encouraging signs this week at all?
 SERGIO GARCIA: I was happy with the way I played yesterday. I was pretty happy the way I played today until probably the fifth hole, just hit a horrendous shot there, and you know, obviously not concentrating. 
 That kind of took me a little bit out of my comfort zone. After that bad swing, I hit a couple of bad shots after that, and it kind of put me on the defence a little bit.
 But you know, I guess that's the way it is. 

 Q. Must be so frustrating when you know how well you can play. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I mean, maybe it is, but I didn't do it today, so there's no excuse about that. 

 Q. Mind-set for the weekend? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: We'll see. Try to play well and see where that gets us.
