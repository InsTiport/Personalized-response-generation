 Q.   Tell us about that finish, because that's a spectacular end to the championship.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   It was a great finish, unfortunately kind of left myself too much work to do.   But very excited about the way I played, pretty much all week.   
   
 Q.   You knew that you had to shoot low going into the final round; were you looking at boards and seeing how close you got?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   I didn't really look until the ninth hole.   Then I saw when I made that putt‑‑ I was trying to get it to 20‑under and hope that that's going to be enough‑‑ obviously it's not going to be enough.   Like I say, just too much work.   
But it was nice, nice the way I played, and the way things kind of come around, it was nice to finish like that.  
   
 Q.   Something special about you and this track, isn't there?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I've been fortunate to play well here.   I think that I didn't play since 2009 I think, so it's been a while since I've been back here.   It's been nice to be back and play nicely and have a nice week.  
   
 Q.   Nothing but positive events to come.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it's been good.   This year, a lot of good finishes.   Unfortunately no wins yet, but I can't be disappointed with the way I played.
