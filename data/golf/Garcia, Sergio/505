   SERGIO GARCIA:  Missed a couple of short ones coming in but it was good overall. I guess being the first round of the year it is not too bad. I am not that happy as I could easily have been around the lead or one back but still a decent round. 

 Q.  Not too many signs of rust early on? 
 SERGIO GARCIA:  There were some. There are some things I still need to work on so need to get them sorted.
