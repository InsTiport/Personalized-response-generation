 Q.   An up and down match that took 22 holes to resolve.   Is the first emotion relief?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, you know, it was a long match.   It was a tough match.   I mean, I thought Marc, other than 18, he played very well.   He put me under pressure most of the holes.   
I didn't play that great, but I managed to stay, you know, with a couple of nice birdies and then a couple of really good pars, I guess.   But it was a difficult match.  
   
 Q.   You had a chance to close it out at 18.   You had a poor chip and then a poor putt.   How do you put that behind you and go on and get into that sudden death where it's so crucial, every shot is good?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, the putt was terrible.   The chip wasn't that bad.   I just misjudged it.   I felt it was going to be much quicker as soon as it went over the hill.   I should have hit the pitching wedge instead of the sand wedge.   The putt wasn't good.   
You know, I thought just keep giving yourself chances to win and hopefully eventually you will make it and get through.   And he gave me a little bit of a breather on 2, when he hit it left, after I had a difficult chance at making birdie.   
And then good up‑and‑down on 3 and a very nice birdie on 4.  
   
 Q.   Bill Haas tomorrow.   Your thoughts on that one?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Going to be a touch match.   He's a great player, a good friend of mine.   We get along well, but very good player, so it's going to be difficult.   
Hopefully I'll feel a little bit better.   I'll play a little bit better tomorrow.   I'm going to need it.   We'll see.
