SERGIO GARCIA:  It was easier than yesterday in the
morning.  The last five, six greens, there were already signs of
getting a little bit -- not like yesterday afternoon, but close.
So I think it's still going to play difficult.  And we'll see.
The wind is subtly different, so some of the clubs you hit off the
tees and shots into the greens are totally different than
yesterday and the practice rounds.
Q.  Is that part of the problem that you're not really sure
what to expect from the different winds?
SERGIO GARCIA:  No, it just plays different.  You just
have to rethink everything that you've done.  But that's about it.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, he's definitely putted -- chipped
and putted better than he usually does, these first two days.  I'm
sure he's played -- he's practiced a lot.  And you can see it.
Some days it comes out better, and some others it doesn't come out
that great.  But he's done very well these first two days.
