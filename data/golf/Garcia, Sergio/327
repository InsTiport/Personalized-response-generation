Q.   That match was incredible to watch, tell us what it was like to be a part of. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know, it was‑‑ the way that Luke held the match on the back nine was amazing.   I was struggling a little bit this week, I didn't feel very comfortable, but I putted well, I hit some good birdies and then he took over. 

Q.   On 17, how big was the adrenaline? 
LUKE DONALD:   I felt really calm all day.   I don't know why, but I just did.   And kind of went back to 2006 where I hit a 6‑iron to the right pin to about that, and I just thought, just do the same.   I knew we had to make birdies coming in.   Tiger was making‑‑ they were making birdies on the hard holes on the back nine, 12, 13, 16.   So we just had to stay patient and keep making more birdies. 

Q.   Describe coming up the last. 
LUKE DONALD:   We knew it was going to be a tough match.   You never give up against Tiger and Stricker.   They are a formidable pairing and they played great on the back nine.   They birdied all the tough holes 12, 13, Tiger hit an unbelievable shot there and 16 again.   The holes you think par may be good enough for a halveyou needed birdie.
SERGIO GARCIA:   We wanted it because we knew it was very important to the team.   We were trying very hard.   I was trying my hardest.   You know, Luke, the way he played coming in was amazing.
