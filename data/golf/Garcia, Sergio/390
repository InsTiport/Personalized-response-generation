  Q. How difficult was it to go out there today knowing that we've lost Seve?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, it's unfortunate and it's difficult, but that wasn't why I played so poorly. I just hardly did anything great this week. But yeah, it's a sad day. We're all feeling for Seve's family. He's been suffering for quite a while now, so probably better that he's resting now.  
  
  Q. For future generations that come up and ask you, what was he like, what was it like to be a friend and be mentored by Seve, what would you tell them?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, he was special. He was just such an amazing player, such an amazing person. He was just different, the charisma he had and everything, the way he played, the way he went around it, it was great to watch. You know, it's a shame that some of the young guys didn't get to know him more.
