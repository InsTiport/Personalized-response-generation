Q.  Sergio, talk about your round today. 

SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I'm pretty happy about it.  It's a tough day and the course is playing tough.  It's difficult out there.  It really feels like a U.S. Open type of championship.  So, you know, definitely it could have been a couple of shots better.  You know, 2-over is not that bad of a round.  The course is playing tough. 


Q.  Is it the rough that's making it difficult?

SERGIO GARCIA:   I think everything, everything.  The rough is thick.  It's tough.  The greens are very little and they are getting firm and quite slopey.  So if you miss a fairway, it's tough to get it on the greens.  I think that they build up and they make the course play tough by the end. 


Q.  Is it drying up? 

SERGIO GARCIA:   It's the greens were a lot firmer this afternoon and tomorrow they are just going to be firmer and firmer.  If the weather does what it is supposed to do, by Saturday and Sunday it's going to be  -- this is going to be a struggle out there.  A lot of guys are going to be struggling. 


Q.  4-under is the lead right now; do you think the score will be higher? 

SERGIO GARCIA:   Definitely, with the weather, definitely. 


Q.  What do you think you need to do tomorrow?  Are you going to work on anything tonight?

SERGIO GARCIA:   Not really.  I felt pretty good about it.  I hit a couple loose shots, but I felt like I hit some really good ones.  I probably wished I got a little better start but other than that I think I'm not too unhappy about it.  So we'll see about tomorrow. 


Q.  Any tough holes? 

SERGIO GARCIA:   17 is tough, 18.  There's a lot of good holes out there.
