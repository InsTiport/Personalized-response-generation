   SERGIO GARCIA: You know, Charl played well and didn't give me much, and finally I worked really hard for 15 holes and played really, really well, and unfortunately just hit two bad shots on 16 and 17, he took chances, and on the last I had a chance. 

 Q. What did you hit in there?
 SERGIO GARCIA: 9-iron.

 Q. What's it like playing with a guy who just made everything? Was it hard to just keep grinding like that? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, he did. He did make a lot of putts, but even like that, I still had my chances. I was 2-up, and I was in control of the game. Unfortunately I just let it slip away.
