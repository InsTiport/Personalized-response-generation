 Q. Could you just talk about your round a little bit?   Seems like you made everything you looked at just about.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I didn't, funny enough.   If you would have seen me on the front nine, I played better on the front nine than I did on the back.   Obviously I couldn't really‑‑ I mean, I only made a couple putts on the front nine.   I hit every single green, gave myself good birdie chances everywhere.   Hit some good putts.   But then on the back nine I played well, probably not as well as the front, but yeah, I started rolling the putts in.   I just got in a good rhythm on the greens.   It seemed like I had a good feel for it, and every putt just wanted to drop.  
I actually thought that the one on the last was going to go in, too.   I hit it exactly where I wanted, but unfortunately it just didn't break to the right.  
   
 Q.   But you made that one on 8?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, and the one on 7 and 6 and 5 and 4 and 3 and 2.   
   
 Q.   You get on a roll like that, do you feel like, hey, I can make anything?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I mean, unfortunately we don't have enough of those, but when you start going like that, obviously it feels great.   You know, everything seems kind of clearer in your head, you seem to see the break.   You don't see like, it might break left but it might not.   You seem to feel like everything is a little bit easier, a little bit smoother, and you hit the putt and it manages to go in.   
But yeah, it's good to enjoy them.   Unfortunately if it was easy we would have plenty of those, but it's not.   It's enjoy them while you have them.
