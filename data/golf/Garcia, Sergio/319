  SARAH GWYNN:   Sergio, thanks for coming in, welcome to the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters.   You have a fantastic record here the last few years, it must be a place you enjoy coming back to.
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, I guess it's been a nice place to start the year for me.   I haven't been able to win, but like you said, I had some good success here good, amount of top ten finishes.   I enjoy the course.   Usually plays quite difficult, a little breezy, so yeah, it's a good week to start the year, hopefully we'll get it going this year again.
SARAH GWYNN:   How is your game feeling right now? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It feels okay.   Obviously probably still a little rusty, after five weeks off.   But, you know, it feels like it's slowly getting into it.   Obviously when the competition starts, everything, it's a little bit different. 
SARAH GWYNN:   Anything in particular you've been working on in the off‑season? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, not really.   Just kind of try to keep improving on every aspect of the game, short game, long game, everything.   So hopefully we'll be able to make sure that things work out and put some good scores. 

Q.   Paul Lawrie sounds like he owns this place   how do you feel about that?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, everybody's obviously got a chance here, and Paul obviously played very well last year, and I think he's won twice here.   So he obviously is very happy about this place.   Like I said, I've done fairly well here without winning, and we'll see.   We'll see how things turnout.   We'll try to give it a good performance and hopefully we'll come in Saturday. 

Q.   What did you do in the winter break?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I went to Crans Montana for a couple weeks during Christmas.   We usually spend Christmas there with family, so that was nice, a lot of snow.   Then I went to Bahamas for a week and then last week I went back to Spain and practised a bit and tried to get ready for the coming season. 

Q.   You ve had some slumps in your career, how have you come back from them?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   At the end of the day, this is what we do.   We love doing it, and we know that there's going to be good moments and bad moments.   The most important thing is to only give the bad moments the credit they deserve, try to learn from it.   But you know, improve as the years go by and believe in yourself and be patient. 
Life, I mean, golf is the kind of sport that is asking you to be very, very patient, just like in life.   So I think that's the only thing you can do.   Try to play with the best attitude possible and be as patient as you can and wait for things to happen. 

Q.   But you re comfortable now?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, obviously I'm happy with the way things have been going the past couple years and I feel comfortable within myself, which is important.   Then, you know, it's just a matter of trying the best you can out there and hopefully the best is pretty good.   You're obviously going to keep trying but I feel pretty happy where I am. 

Q.   You obviously play pretty well in windy conditions.
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I don't know, I just enjoy it.   I feel fairly comfortable on it.   Usually windy conditions are fairly good for me.   I usually tend to do okay in windy conditions, and we get a lot of that here in Qatar.   So, you know, probably those are some of the reasons. 

Q.   Did you play last week?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I did not. 

Q.   Are you ready for competition?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, the competition is going to be great, as every single tournament is.   I'm hoping that mine is good, too.   But I'm sure that the level of play will be great.   There's a good, strong field this week.   Maybe not as strong as a couple years back or something, but still a lot of good, solid players are here, and you know, we'll see what happens. 

Q.   Have you set goals for this season?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   No, not really.   Just keep improving, keep up the kind of attitude and the kind of will that I've been having for the past probably seven or eight months.   And you know, just hopefully keep improving on every aspect of the game and just try to play as well and win as many as I can. 

Q.   How much will you play on The European Tour and the PGA Tour this season?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It's going to be very similar, like every year.   Obviously a little bit more in the U.S. than in Europe.   The minimum is obviously higher there, but it's going to be very similar like every year has been. 
SARAH GWYNN:   Thanks, Sergio.
