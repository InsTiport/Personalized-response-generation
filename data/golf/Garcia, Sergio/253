 Q.   Describe the approach shot that you hit into number 10 in as much detail as you care to.   Because it looked to me like a hook wind and I don't know how you hit a draw shot there.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it was, the wind was helping right‑to‑left.   I think I had 176 yards to the pin, 171 to carry the bunker.   But it was a really nice yardage to hit like a solid, hold 8‑iron.   
Just fortunate to put a great swing on it.   It came out dead straight, obviously holding with the wind.   And I managed to hit it to ‑‑ it flew like three feet into the green and managed to hit it to like a couple of feet.  
   
 Q.   Is that shot actually a fade shot that the wind drew a little bit?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, I hit it just left of the hole with a little fade and it kind of faded a little bit and then kind of maybe just dropped to the left with the wind when it kind of lost its speed or its power.   
   
 Q.   That was really good.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Thank you very much.   I was happy with that one.  
   
 Q.   What do you make of your position now?   Going into tomorrow, are you pleased or?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, for sure.   Of course, I would love to be six shots better, if I could.   But, no, I am happy.   I can't be disappointed with it.   I think that the playing conditions were tough.   You had to be very much on your game to be able to make birdies and not make many mistakes.   I think that the greens, the greens definitely felt like they were at least a couple of feet faster than they were on Wednesday, for sure, and probably over a foot from Thursday.   
So the greens were firmer, they were definitely faster, a little bit tougher to get to some of those pins, but I think we managed to do fairly well overall.  
   
 Q.   Can you describe your comfort level on this golf course.   It seems to be a golf course that fits your eye.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yes, they say that there's courses for horses.   I think that, unfortunately, Augusta is one that doesn't get into my eyes for some reason, I seem to struggle to feel comfortable there.   I see too many shots at Augusta.   
Here, I see less shots.   I see, in my head, I have everything a bit more clear of what I want to do.   
Then it's a matter of being able to do it.   
I've been fortunate to play well here, I've been fortunate to do well for awhile now here, so I'm always, obviously, always excited to come back and give it a shot.  
   
 Q.   How long did it take you to be comfortable here?   Do you remember the first time you came here?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I do.   At the beginning it was a little bit tough.   I didn't ‑‑ I didn't see it right away, but I guess, probably after the second year or so, I started kind of realizing what I wanted to do on the course a little bit more often, kind of having a bit more clear thoughts of how I wanted to attack it.   
I think probably, because of that, since that, since that year, I think it's been good.   I've been in contention quite a lot of years, a lot of good finishes here, so I'm excited about that.  
   
 Q.   Are you surprised that a European hasn't won yet this year on the PGA TOUR?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I didn't even think about it.   Yeah, I guess so.   I guess.   But it's such a thin line between winning and fishing second or third.   So I think that I've been close a couple times, Justin has been close, Luke has been very close.   So there's been a lot of guys that have had the chance.   
It's a very thin line between winning and finishing second or third.   So it's not like we haven't had chances, but hopefully it will happen soon.  
   
 Q.   We talked about the conditions today, is this more like what you guys are used to at the PLAYERS, a little bit harder, a little bit faster?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, definitely.   Definitely this is a bit more of what we are used to seeing here.   Still, because of the way the greens are, some of them are a little bit sandy, so you can sort of stop the ball a little bit easier on some of the holes that maybe you don't expect it as much, yeah, but overall, it is definitely a bit more, with good weather, what we expect to see here.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember the last time you have shown as much emotion on a Saturday as you did with the putt on 18 there.   It's only a third round.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Probably in Houston, when I got up‑and‑down from over the green.   
Yeah, every time ‑‑ every time I play I try to show what I am and how I am and, obviously, when you are in contention, it comes out a little bit even more.   
But I think it was a big moment ‑‑ I'm not going to say for tomorrow, but for tonight.   So I don't go home ‑‑ even though I still would have been happy with 70, to finish bogey, bogey, hitting good shots, it would have felt ‑‑ dinner would have tasted quite horrible.   
So I guess that's probably one of the reasons why it was nice to make it.   It's a tough putt too, that one on 18.  
   
 Q.   That consistency that you talked about earlier that you've had here over the years, it's pretty unusual on this course, a lot of guys are up‑and‑down, like Phil hasn't had a top‑10 since he won.   You see that a lot with guys.   Why do you think that is and why do you think you've been able to sort of overcome that?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know.   I don't know.   But if I told you, I would have to kill you probably.   
(Laughter.)  
No ‑‑ oh, so you want me to tell him?   
(Laughter.)  
I don't know.   It's funny, it is the kind of course that it's a very thin line between doing well and maybe shooting a couple over or something like that and then being off the cut like Phil was.   
But it's the kind of course that, if you're on, you do get a good amount of birdie chances.   So I guess you just got to be patient and wait for those good moments.
