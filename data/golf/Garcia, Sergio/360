Q.   Great hole‑in‑one, when was the last time you had one? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Last, well, actually, it's my first one on The European Tour in competition.   Last one I had in competition was at the BMW in St.Louis, I think it was, three years ago. 

Q.   Do you know the prize that you won?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, I stay three nights in the Emirates Palace every year. 

Q.   What club did you hit? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   7‑iron. 

Q.   So how would you assess that round of golf today? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I think that funny enough, I hit the ball better than I probably expected it.   I haven't had the best of practise back home and the first couple of days here.   I hit the ball fairly good.   We didn't make a putt between the three of us. 
We hit some really good putts but we could not hole a putt.   These greens are very, very tricky.   But other than that, you know, I'm happy with the round.   This course is so different from two or three years ago, the last time I played it.   It's much harder.   Fairways are narrower.   They put a lot of bunkers into some of these tee shots, the rough is really thick.   It's definitely a lot tougher. 

Q.   Two great wins last year, how important was that for you coming into this year?   Because you were down in the dumps, when I saw you at The Ryder Cup, you were there in a supportive role but not the guy I knew, and you had two great wins; how important was that for you? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Before that, I think a lot of things were important.   I think throughout the whole year last year, a lot of good things‑‑ we managed to do a lot of good things.   A lot of good things happened to us in the majors and some tournaments here and there, and obviously BMW and Munich and things like that, and that helped me get a little bit of confidence back, and then obviously Castellon and Valderrama were a perfect way to finish the year.
