 Q. In great position going into the weekend at a Major again. Is this the same thing about being happier and enjoying the golf? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Definitely. Definitely. Today was a day where I could have been quite frustrated because I felt like I did a lot of good things and I didn't get rewarded at all. I hit a lot of great putts and I holed nothing pretty much other, than the putt on 14. 
 So, but that's the way it is. I think that the other day I gave it good chances and I hit, I put some really good rolls on it and unfortunately it was one of those days where the ball just didn't want to drop. And, but the good thing is that the game was there. I played solid again. 
 I hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens. And it's just a little bit unfortunate I guess that I didn't get a little bit more out of my round. 

 Q. You said that you had some garbage that you needed to get out of your head and then the next day you went out and shot a really good number at St. Andrews. Was that a turning point and is that how far you've come, do you think?
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, I did -- I did have some good rounds last year, I mean it's not like I never shot a round under 70 or anything like that. So, but I wasn't very consistent. 
 I think that this year I think my attitude is a little bit better, I think that I'm doing things a little bit better. I'm trying to, I kind of figured out myself a little bit better and that's important too. 
 So it's just a matter of hopefully keep going like I've been doing, I think that for me there's a lot of good things that have been happening in the past about my attitude and I just have to keep building on that.

 Q. How good was it to be back among the guys and not playing?
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was good, it was definitely good, but at the same time it was hard, because I wasn't playing. And I felt like, even though I tried as hard as I could, I felt like I couldn't really help as much as I wanted to. So, but it kind of puts things into perspective and I'm just looking forward to get back home.
