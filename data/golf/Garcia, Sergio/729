Q. How many tournaments have you played here and your record in them?

SERGIO GARCIA: Here in Valderrama? I've never played -- I just played a match, I think
it was in '95, but I've never played a tournament.

Q. What about this week, Sergio, how do you find the course?

SERGIO GARCIA: The course is in very good shape, fairways are perfect. We have a pretty
tough rough out there, because this grass is kind of difficult. And the greens are very
good, so the course is in perfect shape. There's no complaints about the course.

Q. How do you rate your chances of catching Monte at the top of the money list?

SERGIO GARCIA: It's going to be difficult, but I have to try to play my best and let's
see if I can win the tournament. If not, I don't know if I can finish worse than second.
And he has to do bad. So I'll try to win the tournament, and if I do, I'll have my
chances.

Q. In the short time that you've been a professional, how much pressure do you feel
performing, playing in your homeland?

SERGIO GARCIA: Not really. I've noticed that there are some people who want me to play
well and to do well and to win here, but that's not something I really focus on. I just
try to play well, just try to have some fun and feel proud of myself. If I win, that
doesn't matter. Last week I played very well, and I did well, because I didn't make too
many putts. But I felt proud of myself, even without winning.

Q. Would it mean more to you to win in Spain as compared to winning in Germany or
Ireland or the States?

SERGIO GARCIA: It would be different, it would be my first victory in Spain as a pro.
But I think this week it's pretty tough to win. I'll try, but if not, hopefully one day it
will come.

Q. There's a fear among some players that the greens are going to spike up and be more
difficult for the players playing later in the day; you have a late tee off on the first
day.

SERGIO GARCIA: Yes, it looks like they're spiking up a little. Today they look a little
better. But Monday and Tuesday they spiked up a little. Hopefully they won't too much, but
if they do, that's something that has been happening on greens for a long time. Hope not
to get too many spikes on your line, and just focus not too much on that.

Q. Do you think Tiger Woods can be beaten here this week? And if so, how would you do
it?

SERGIO GARCIA: Well, of course I think -- the best players in the world are here, and
of course I think he can be beaten. He can be beat. You probably have to play really well.
I don't know, it all depends on how the weather is going to be and how he's going to play.
You never know if he's going to play great or he's going to play not that good and maybe
somebody can beat him. But he's having some great weeks. I'm sure it's going to be tough
to beat him. He's confident. I think his confidence is pretty high.

Q. How much more do you look forward to a tournament when Tiger is there, just because
of the way he's been playing over the past two months? Is it much more satisfying to win?

SERGIO GARCIA: Not because of the way he's been playing, but because of him -- I like
to play against him. And I always have a lot of fun playing with him. I would say that
when he comes, when I play a tournament with him, I kind of feel like more inspired, but
I'm really looking forward to this week, not only because of him, because of the great
field we have here.
