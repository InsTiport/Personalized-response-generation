Q.   Well, can't win a golf tournament on Thursday.   You kind put yourself in position.
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yes, no, great, I'm very happy with my 67.   Even more after not having the best of starts, 2-over after 4 and under windy conditions, wind that wasn't easy the play in.   I'm very happy with that and more of the same for the rest of the week.

Q.   What is it about this course you enjoy playing and preparing for what you're going to see next week?   You come back here quite a bit.
SERGIO GARCIA:   I guess I got to enjoy it a little bit, and I think it's the kind of course that is -- it's obviously easier than Augusta might be, but it's asking you to hit a lot of tense shots, lot of tight shots with water and things like that.   It's kind of putting you in similar situation to what you might have next week, you know, more or less, and -- but more than anything, they take great care of us.   Golf course is nice.   Great tournament and that's great people, lot of press, enjoy that. 

Q.   Just going to ask you real quick, one of the guys doing a story on the crowds here.   Y'all see crowds every week.   Specifically the walk from 18 to here, nice little alley.   Fans line up for you guys even after a bad round, good round.   You see the support out there.   What does it mean to you personally to get the continued support?
SERGIO GARCIA:   It's great.   It's real important.   Without all these people, without all the fans, we wouldn't be here.   So, you know, we feel very blessed that they're all here supporting us and cheering us on, and we try to give them our best show that we can.

Q.   Few autographs and you guys reach out like everyday.
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, of course.

Q.   As many as you can.
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   We wouldn't get home, you know, if we did everybody, but we try to sign as many as we can and make some of the little guys happy.
