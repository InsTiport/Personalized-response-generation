 Q.   Obviously we can't do anything about the weather.   Just off to a good start, 1-under on the 5th hole of the day.   How did you feel getting going today?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I had a great par on 1, kind of lipped out for birdie.   Made a good par on the next and then hit a very nice shot on 3 to make my birdie.   
So, yeah, it's just a shame I caught a little heavy with my second shot on 5 but, overall, it was a decent start.   You know, we're all out there.   Going to be a long day tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Certainly not the first time you've been affected by weather.   Do you just keep kind of doing what you're doing, cards, light-hearted night?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   There's nothing you can do.   I mean definitely the weather is one thing we can't control so yeah, just kind of be patient and we'll see.
