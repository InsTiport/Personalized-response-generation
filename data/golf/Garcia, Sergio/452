   SERGIO GARCÃA: A round around par on this golf course is always a good round. A shame the 17th but overall, I think I drove the ball very nicely and I hit a lot of greens. 
 I had a couple of not great putts early in the round, but overall, I think I putted well.
 On the 17th, I went for it. My short game, I think it's better than it ever has been. 17, I had to go for it. If I wouldn't have gone, I have felt bad. I tried to make birdie on the 18th. Pity with the weather, but I think I've played quite decently. 
 Yesterday it was one of those days. I stayed here until maybe between four or five until they decided that we could not play. I went back to the hotel and I was watching TV and then I went out for dinner.
