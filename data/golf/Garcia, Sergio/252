  SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I mean, obviously I didn't play as well as yesterday with the difficulty.   I didn't feel like I played that badly.   Obviously a couple bad shots especially on 11, second shot on 15.   Other than that, it wasn't too bad.   I made a bogey on the 1st.   I misjudged the wind a little bit.   I hit a good shot on 10 and, you know, it just -- I don't know -- it hit the hole and took a bounce. 
You know, I guess that's the way it is, and it was difficult out there.   It wasn't that easy.   I played really, really well, I thought, that under the conditions, still quite breezy and as firm as the greens were.   It was difficult to hit it close.

Q.   I thought your short putts were good.   A lot of putts burned the edge.   Little luck factor involved there.   Maybe it goes your way on Sunday.
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I think the only thing you can do is do the best possible.   Sometimes you read them right, sometimes you don't, and sometimes they go in, sometimes they lip out or they are on the edge.   But I felt quite good for most putts.   I thought that, like I said, I handled them well without maybe playing my best, and, you know, we'll see what happens tomorrow.

Q.   You know what you need to do, you need to eat more sushi tonight.
SERGIO GARCIA:   That's probably it.
