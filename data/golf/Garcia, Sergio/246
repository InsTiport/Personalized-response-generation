  SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   I can say that I am‑‑ obviously I didn't play my best these last couple of days, but I think overall, you know, this is a good result.   We'll see how the weekend goes.  
   
 Q.   Same question I just asked Vijay.   We talk about good fields and bad fields on the PGA TOUR, but there's a lot of big names, you, Vijay, Kuchar, Snedeker, they're all on the leaderboard now.   Is that sort of an old notion, the fact that there aren't good fields on the PGA TOUR?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I think there's‑‑ I think there are no bad fields on the TOUR.   I think that we're fortunate to get a lot of good players playing here on the PGA TOUR, and when some of them are not playing, then the others are playing.   
So you know, for the most part every field is really, really strong, and you know, I think it only gets weakened up when you have like one of those I don't know how you call it, close sanction, the one that you play on a world tour event week or something like that, but other than that, I think usually they're very good.  
   
 Q.   Did you make any adjustments coming into this week off the past couple of weeks in your performances?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, not really.   I mean obviously you have to adjust to the speed of the greens, different grass in comparison to last week, but other than that, no.   The game is still pretty much the same.  
   
 Q.   How low do you think you're going to need to go this weekend to be right there?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know.   I'm going to try to shoot the lowest I can and see where that puts me.   I don't think that‑‑ it's difficult to say.   You know, the weather stays good and it firms up, the greens were much faster today.   They were designed to firm up a little bit.   So I think if it firms up, this course won't go crazy, but it all depends on the weather.
