Q. Sergio, how would you sum up the day for you?
SERGIO GARCIA: I was doing fairly well all day, looking at shooting between 3 and 5-under, and unfortunately, you know, ended up shooting 1.  So, little disappointed with that, but I'm a little bit flat at the moment.  Yesterday was a very long day in the afternoon with the rain.  That didn't help very much.  Hopefully I can charge up a little bit today and have a decent run tomorrow and a good weekend.
