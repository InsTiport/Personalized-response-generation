 Q.   3‑under for the round today, were you pleased and what was the difference today in the back nine?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It was just making putts.   I played pretty much the same way front and back.   I just got a good draw on the front nine, holed three good putts.   I was in pretty close but had a lot of really nice putts.  
Unfortunately on the back nine, I could have easily finished 6‑, 7‑under for the tournament, but unfortunately the putts didn't drop.   That's the way it goes.   
   
 Q.   Looking at the results from last year, do you see any difference scoring‑wise?   Is it more difficult?   Scores are a little bit higher than they were last year.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   They are much higher, definitely.   At the moment, 8‑under is leading and that was leading probably in the last three or four years in the first round.   So this course‑‑ the course is much tougher.   The rough, it much thicker.   
The fairways feel much narrower than three years ago, the last time I played here.   They put some bunkers in.   They have got a couple new sections in a couple of the greens.   So it's definitely a much tougher course than it used to be.
