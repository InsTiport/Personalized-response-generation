  Q. How do you feel about your round today?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, disappointing day. I tried hard, but I don't know, just my head kind of went out on 9 and I just couldn't recover. But it's been the same all week. It's a work in progress and we need to get better at it and there's been some good positive things and unfortunately today it's been a really bad nine. And nothing you can do about that.   
  
  Q. So you had, on the front side can you go over your birdies and then on the back side if you wouldn't mind going over those as well?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Really?   
  
  Q. If you don't mind.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Birdied 2, hit a really nice drive and a 5-wood, almost eagled it by about 15 feet, the first putt.   
 Then on 3 I hit a nice drive and then I had like 60 yards. Hit it to about 8 feet and made that.   
 Then on 5 I hit a good drive again, really nice 8-iron to about nine feet and made that.   
 And then hit a bad second on 10, left of the green. A good chip and then unfortunately I pulled my putt a little bit.  
 On 11 I hit just a series of bad shots and made double. I pushed it into the bunker, tough bunker shot. Hit a good putt, unfortunately it didn't go in.   
 And 14 I hit a bad terrible second shot with a wedge and 3-putted from the front of the green.   
 And then, oh, what else? I made -- on 18 I hit a great drive and a really bad second shot 9-iron and couldn't get up-and-down.   
  
  Q. So tomorrow? How do you regroup and start?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Nothing. I'll come here and an hour before my tee time, I'll practice, I'll go out there and I'll try to do better.
