 Q. You had it going, you were cruising and we're seeing a lot on the leaderboard on back nine in trouble for some folks.   Can you tell us about that?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, the greens were really firm, so it was, even though there wasn't much wind it was playing tough.   It was very difficult to hit it close.   
I had so many good shots that didn't end up close and some of them I made bogey with.   So it was just tough.   
   
 Q.   What about the bounce back of making those back‑to‑back birdies after 11.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it was nice, but then I bogeyed 14 and it wasn't great.   
On 15, I couldn't make birdie, unfortunately.   
I had a good birdie on 16.   And it's a good way to finish, I guess.  
   
 Q.   What iron did you have on 16?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   8‑iron.  
   
 Q.   With the youngster making the cut, what do you make of that?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   It's great.   It's amazing.   I don't know what he shot today.  
   
 Q.   5‑over today.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I mean it's ‑‑ with his distance and how long this course is, I can't imagine some of the clubs he's been, he must have been hitting, so it's very impressive for him to make the cut.  
   
 Q.   How do you rate Langer's performance at 55?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Amazing.   I mean, he's just a fighter.   I've played with him here a good amount of times now and it was impressive.   He plays solid and he doesn't waste any shots out there.   
He manages to get everything around the best way possible and it was very impressive.
