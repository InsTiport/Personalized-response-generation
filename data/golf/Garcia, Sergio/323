 Q.   Fantastic shot.  
    SERGIO GARCIA:   Of course, fantastic three shots.   Hit a great drive and a great 6‑iron and then a wonderful putt.   So happy for him.   Obviously he's been trying for a while and he deserves it, and you know, after the start he had today, it's quite impressive for him to come back the way he did and win.   So I gave it my best effort.   
   
 Q.   Still disappointing, because you couldn't have done much more?  
    SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, obviously the last ten or 11 holes was good.   The first six holes, I didn't feel great with my swing and you could see it.   But the way I played those last 11 or 12 holes in windy conditions, it was pretty good, so happy about that.  
   
 Q.   Was today the toughest day for the conditions?   
    SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I guess‑‑ I think that the wind was similar to yesterday but because of the situation it was probably the toughest.   
   
 Q.   Where is next for you?  
    SERGIO GARCIA:   Dubai next week.
