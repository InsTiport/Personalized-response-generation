Q. Let's say you were writing it to the end.  Obviously a bad discussion on the back nine, but positives to take away?
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, a lot.  A lot of positives.  I felt both Scottie and I played extremely well under the conditions.  We've done really well, and unfortunately one mental error for me on 14, knowing how fast that putt really is.  Got too greedy.  And I was just coming off a birdie, I was thinking let's make another one and keep going.
Unfortunately got a bogey and it stuck with me and a couple bad breaks coming in.  But it is what it is, I guess.
Q. (No microphone) all week long, do you feel happy with the way you're playing?
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, definitely.  I think it's great.  I was telling the Spanish media that it's been a while since I've been in a Major four rounds out there in contention.  So it was great.  It was a great experience.  Obviously, there's a lot of nerves, but I really enjoyed it.
I think that I handled it quite well, and unfortunately, came up a little bit short.  But I'm still happy with it, with the week.
Q. Dustin's one of these players, we were just talking to Scott about it, that you feel like he's just too good to not win.  Certainly, that can be said for you.  Do you sort of feel that your game is just too good to not win a Major championship?
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I mean, I definitely think so.  I just got to keep putting myself in this situation and, you know, at some point in time, I'm sure that, you know, the coin will end up, will fall off on heads instead of tails.
But at the end of the day, this is what we work for.  This is what we practice hard for, to put ourselves in this position over and over again.  That's the most important thing.
I think, for me, it is very hard to keep putting yourself in that situation.  And that always shows me a lot for myself.
Q. Sergio, did you know what happened with Dustin behind you?
SERGIO GARCIA: Yes.
Q. What did you make of that situation, if anything at all?
SERGIO GARCIA: No, they mentioned on the 15th tee, the USGA, the woman that was rules official that was following us in a group, she said, you know, there's a possibility that Dustin might get a penalty shot.  And it was nice to know.  I thought that that was great from them.
But at the end of the day, it is what it is.  It's not certain.  They're probably looking at it now.
Q. On the last day of the Majors, was it hard to figure out where to attack and where to challenge and where to be a little bit smarter just because the golf course changed a little bit, or no?
SERGIO GARCIA: Not really.  I kept playing the same way I played all week.  It's just a matter of it's a tough golf course, and you -- if you're a little bit off, it's going to bite you.  You've just got to hit good shot after good shot after good shot.  Sometimes it's not that easy, but I thought the USGA did really well.  I thought the course was awesome.
I felt that it was presented unbelievable.  Personally, I think these are the best quality greens I've ever putted on.  Probably a little too much sand in the bunkers, if there was one little thing.  But other than that, I thought the championship was amazing.
