 Q. Nice round of golf. Were you content with the round?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, it was a good result, I would say. I did play some decent holes coming in. I didn't start the day the best way, but I think overall it was good. It was a nice round and we'll see what we can do tomorrow.

 Q. Rory is at 14-under, a ten-stroke lead. Do you try not to let that get into your objectives?
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, not at all. I'm trying to play well tomorrow and shoot the lowest I can shoot. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not going to go out there and say I'm going to try to shoot 62, no. I'm trying to shoot the lowest I can. If the lowest I can is 70, great. If it's 65, great. If it's 73, great. That's all I can do.
 He's playing awesome. I would expect him to play the same way tomorrow and probably win. He's looking great. So like I said yesterday, I hope he does it, he's a great guy and he deserves it.

 Q. You did well out there today. Were you able to get yourself out of trouble at times? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I hit a couple of bad drives here and there. I think 11 was huge after I hit my drive right and unfortunately hit an old man in the neck and went in the water, and managed to make a great 4 after bogeying 10. 
 And from then on it seemed like I started to get things a little bit better. Not great, but a little bit better. I made a fortunate birdie on 15, obviously. I mean I had a great shot, but to be able to hit the pin and then make the putt was great. A nice birdie on the next.
 I actually thought I made the putt on the last. Unfortunately it didn't go in.

 Q. So you're mentally in a good place going into tomorrow?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, we'll see tomorrow. We'll see how I wake up. I'm obviously happy where I am. And I'll be trying my hardest to put up a good round tomorrow.
