Q.
Talk about the eagle that you had early.
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, it's a shame because I started pretty well and had a good birdie on 2, hit a good putt on 14.  Unfortunately it didn't go in.  Then I make a weak three putt on 6 and got back nicely with that eagle on 7, and unfortunately it just wasn't meant to be.

After that I hit a wonderful shot into 8.  I thought I was going to hit it stiff.  I was just off the green and it bounced really hard and had a tricky lie and made bogey.  Went in the rough on the next, a pretty bad lie and made another bogey there.  That put me a little bit behind the 8 ball.  I was trying hard, and I felt like I hit some good putts out there on the back nine.  I felt like I played pretty solid, and unfortunately it just wasn't happening.  I hit a good chip on 16, and unfortunately I left it in the jaws on 17.

I knew that something around 10 could still    the holes were playing tough, so somewhere around 10 could still get into the playoff.  It's just a shame.
Q.  Are you surprised that there's a playoff down there today, the way you guys have battled all week?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Not at all.  It's a wonderful golf course.  The leaderboard has been bunched all week long.  I guess it was meant to be to have a playoff.  I'm disappointed that I'm not in it, but that's the way it goes.
Q.  You finished with eight consecutive pars.  Do you think you left out some opportunities of what might have been?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Definitely, yeah.  But more than anything, it was just a shame because every time I was getting it going today, something was stopping me.  You know, after making a great save on 6 for par, I made that stupid three putt on 6.  Then I make my eagle, get a couple of bad bounces, make two bogeys in a row.  Then made a good birdie on 10, and a good putt on 11 that didn't go in, and hit a couple good putts coming in that didn't want to drop.  That's the way it goes.  But I'm happy with the way I played all week and the way I handled the moment.  It's just a shame that I couldn't finish one better.
Q.  Take us through your second on 7.
SERGIO GARCIA:  I hit 2 iron off the tee and had 112 yards to the hole and hit a good, solid lob wedge, and just flew it about a yard short and right and spun back into it.
Q.  Do you think this should be a regular stop on the Tour?
SERGIO GARCIA:  This golf course?  Yeah, it would be nice.  I think it's been a great week.  I mean, the weather has been amazing, the fans unbelievable, and it's been just an incredible week.  It would be brilliant to keep playing something here.  I mean, it was my first time.  They don't come many times here, other than Olympic Club, but it would be nice to see it a bit more often.
