SERGIO GARCÃA: It was a good day.  I can't complain about it.  I played solid.  The course was playing different today, different wind.  It's not easy to get used to it.  I thought I played nicely and I would have taken 67 on a tough course like Doral is right now.
Q. The wind felt different out there, and the way the holes were set up, you mentioned playing them a little different; is there a specific corridor the guys this afternoon are going to be surprised about?
SERGIO GARCÃA: 18 is tough, into off the left.  I hit a really good drive just right of the fairway and hit 6-iron in, where yesterday we were hitting driver 9-iron and driver wedge.  It's going to be interesting to see how they play that.
Other than that, I think 14 is playing straight downwind, so it's not that easy to hit that fairway.  And then you've got holes like 11, it's playing a lot longer today.  So it's going to be interesting to see how they manage over there.
