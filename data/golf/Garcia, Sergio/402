 Q. Talk about how the course played.
 SERGIO GARCIA: Course was playing good. Unfortunately, I left some shots out there, didn't play my best today but it wasn't as windy as we thought it might have been. It was a little gusty at times but they moved some of the tees up and made it a little bit easier but there was some good pins out there, too. Overall, still a tough golf course. There's not a lot of low scoring and the weather was pretty nice.
 It's pretty good.

 Q. Is this the kind of course that golfers like? Is it challenging?
 SERGIO GARCIA: We do. I've had a lot of feedback from not only from pros but amateurs and we all agree that it's a good challenging golf course. They all love it. They like the way it looks. So that's important.
