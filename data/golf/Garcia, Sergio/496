 Q. Start by talking about your day. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was a very similar day to yesterday. I hit the ball nicely again. I felt like I putted nicely, unfortunately just the putts didn't want to drop. And then just a bit of an unfortunate finish, I guess. 
 But you know, with everything that happened, I'm still there. I still have a good chance, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow coming out and playing well again, and we'll see if we can win this championship.

 Q. Is the golf course itself harder today or the conditions were a little bit more benign? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: I think the course was harder. I think the greens were firmer and quicker than yesterday, so that made it a little bit tougher. Obviously it wasn't blowing quite as hard as yesterday, but it was still tricky out there. As the week goes on, the course -- like I said on the first day, courses always get tougher as the week goes on. This one is going to be no different.

 Q. You've always liked this golf course. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah.

 Q. But now you're having to hit a different kind of shot into a lot of different holes, particularly as the week goes on, right? You can't fly it in there anymore or as much?
 SERGIO GARCIA: You've just got to realize that the ball is going to release a bit more, so it gets a little bit trickier with the amount of movement that the greens have and everything. But it's not something that we haven't done before. So I guess it's something we can still handle.

 Q. On 17, the two putts, how much of it was maybe a little misread or just not hitting the ball the way you wanted it?
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, the first one I just -- I didn't want to hit a soft putt, and I just killed it. I hit it really hard, and I probably hit it about four feet by. 
 And then the second one didn't feel like a bad putt, it just really snapped at me, and it was hitting the right edge and kind of snapped a little bit, and instead of lipping in it kind of just caught the edge and missed. What can you do? 

 Q. You've come so close at majors and THE PLAYERS before. Do you feel any pressure at these events?
 SERGIO GARCIA: No.

 Q. Does it help you to play with somebody who's putting good, who's playing good? Will it matter to you? If somebody starts going good, do you kind of feed off that a little bit?
 SERGIO GARCIA: I obviously didn't. I didn't on the shots and the putts; unfortunately he made a lot of putts and unfortunately mine didn't drop as well as his. 
 But you know, Paul played very nicely. You know, he kept himself under control at all times. It seemed like every time he made a mistake, he came back with a nice birdie on the next, so that always helps.

 Q. You wouldn't mind getting in a shootout tomorrow, would you?
 SERGIO GARCIA: I'd love to win it tomorrow. I don't care how it is. 

 Q. How much did you know about Paul? He's been around on the TOUR a long time. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: I've played with him quite a bit.

 Q. Just about his game. He's never broken 70 on this course until this year, and for some reason he seems to be catching lightning in a bottle this week. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Obviously he's a very straight hitter of the ball. He doesn't hit it far, but he controls his ball flight nicely. Obviously around the greens he's been very good this week. I guess that's a good mix when you come to a tough course like this one.

 Q. Where you are off the leaderboard, will you go out tomorrow with a number in mind?
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, I've just got to go out there and try to shoot the lowest score I can shoot, and hopefully it's good enough. And if not, we'll come back next year.

 Q. Do you feel like the conditions with the way they are, as they'll probably get tougher tomorrow, do you feel that the field can come back to you if you hold even par tomorrow?
 SERGIO GARCIA: I hope I move forward. I'm not waiting for the field to come back. That's my goal.
