  Q. Sergio Garcia, you now advance into the semifinals. Your putting was pretty good this morning, except for the last one?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I guess it was pretty solid. It wasn't easy out there, we didn't play our best, that's for sure. I managed to do better the last four holes, but I need to play better. I'm looking forward to the challenge.  
  
  Q. Now you've got this next hour. What about the change in climate in it's probably about 25 degrees different today from yesterday?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, and it got really dark. Hopefully it won't get too wet.  
  
  Q. What will you do with this hour?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: I'm going to go back and relax a little bit and have some food and get ready.  
  
  Q. It wasn't really pretty at times until those last three or four holes. But that's match play. Nicely done.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I guess so. It was tough. I played some good holes on the front nine. I eagled 2, birdied 4, and had some birdie chances.   
 But then I played a couple of terrible holes. But I got it back again. On the back nine, I played the last four or five holes, when I needed it most, I played nicely and got it done.  
  
  Q. Great shot at 2, that second shot, that got you jump started after you lost the first?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, tough start on the first tee. I hit a good tee shot and it went just into the downside of the bunker.   
 But anyway, we managed to get back and win the match and that's what counts.
