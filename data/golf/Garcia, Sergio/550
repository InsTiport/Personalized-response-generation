Q.  How easy is this course playing from what you might normally expect in a major?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, definitely with a softer fairways and the softer greens, it's playing easier.  It's playing easier if you're playing well.  If you're struggling, you're going to shoot a bad round.

I think that you've just got to realize that the guys out there    nowadays, if you don't have perfect weather and the course gets quite firm and quite fast with nice rough, the guys out there can shoot a low number because they're good enough.  That's the main reason.

But definitely the rain made it a little bit easier for the guys that are hitting the ball nicely, and you can see it on the scores.
Q.  Do you change your strategy for this fourth round from other fourth rounds?  You've had a few struggles in fourth rounds.
SERGIO GARCIA:  No, not at all.
Q.  What's different about a Sunday of a major?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Shouldn't be any different, I guess.  You know you're playing for a major, so that might change a little bit.  But you should take it the same way.  You should try to commit to your shots, try to hit as many positive swings as you can, and hopefully finish the best way possible.  We'll see what happens tomorrow, but that's what I'm going to try to do.
Q.  Do you have more confidence going into tomorrow because this is where your best major fourth round was?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I don't know, I guess I do like the course.  I've done well on it, so I don't know whether I can do it.  I've been playing well all week.  That helps.  But tomorrow I've got to go out there and I've got to do it.  It's as simple as that.  Hopefully I can just play like I've played all week long, hopefully hole a couple putts here and there and see if we can threaten a little bit on top.
Q.  Are you disappointed your last putt didn't go in?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Definitely, very.  I felt like I hit a great putt.  It looked like a left edge putt to me, and I felt like I hit a great putt.  I didn't hit it with too much speed, making sure that it was going to break, and it just went dead straight.  It's just one of those things.  What can you do?  I guess I gave it my best, good tee shot, great second shot and a good putt, and sometimes it just doesn't want to do it.
Q.  Are you one of those guys who would rather see scores like this in a major?
SERGIO GARCIA:  No.
Q.  Even par?
SERGIO GARCIA:  No, even par.
Q.  Why?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Mainly because I feel like when the scores are around even par or maybe single digits under par, it feels like you don't have to make every putt to stay in the hunt.  Today I was playing nicely out there, and I made a couple nice putts but I didn't hole a lot.  You're 4  or 5 under and it almost look likes you're not making any ground.  I definitely don't enjoy those kind of events, but there's going to be some of those throughout the year.
Q.  If Tiger ends up being in the lead, what does that do, especially in a place that he's won a major before?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, at the end of the day you've got to go out there and try to play well.  You can't control what he's going to do, and you never know what might happen.  You go out there and hopefully you make some birdies at the beginning, and you've got to go and get some momentum on your side, and maybe he has a couple struggles and you get closer, and you never know what might happen in the end.  That's all you can do.

We know he's a good closer, so we're going to have to give it our best.
