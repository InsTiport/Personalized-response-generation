  THE MODERATOR:   Really a tale of two nines for you this week.   You're 1‑under on the front nine, 10‑under on the back.   Any particular something that really suits you well on the Back 9 here this week? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   No.   No.   I guess if you play well, you probably have maybe a couple more chances on the back 9.   I guess on the front nine you have four that usually plays tough.   2, even though it's short, the green is very tricky and getting firm like it is, it's difficult to get close. 
And then 7 is playing quite difficult every day.   8 is not the easiest hole.   Obviously, the par‑5, 5th, is not very easy, it's quite long.   So I guess‑‑ but I don't know.   I mean it's one of those things that I guess just happens.   I was able to make some good things on the back 9, hit it close to some of the holes and convert them with putts, so I was very happy with that. 

Q.   (No microphone). 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I guess it's been‑‑ yeah, it's been a solid season so far.   There's no doubt I would have liked to play.

Q.   (No microphone). 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Overall it's been positive.   Some good high finishes.   Probably, I would say two really good chances of winning here in the U. S. 

Q.   (No microphone). 
SERGIO GARCIA:   No.   I wish it was as simple as that.   No, I guess‑‑ I heard it a couple times out there on the course today, but we've had such great six years with two European Cups and one World cup.   So I guess for something like this it wasn't supposed to happen.   I wasn't expecting for the team to not get through the group stages, but I thought the season was getting very long, maybe they get to the quarterfinals, semifinals, they would play very well.   But it's different out there in South America for the European teams, so it was a little disappointing on that aspect, but there's nothing that I can do. 

Q.   In all seriousness, is there a little national pride where you can sort of give the fans back in Spain a little something to be happy about?
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, I wouldn't say so, no.   FÃºtbol in Spain is everything.   If I would manage to, it would be great to go and win tomorrow.   It wouldn't make up for it, not for the fÃºtbol fans.

Q.   First time back here in five years; correct?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.

Q.   How come?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I thought this year it fit nicely into the schedule.   Obviously I need to get my numbers up to standard to make sure that I don't have to play too much going into the Ryder Cup.   So with the U.S. Open here last week and then this week‑‑ because usually it's been U.S. Open and the week after has been the BMW in Germany, which I always play and I'm playing this year.   But this year there was a week in between, so I thought it was a good chance to come for two weeks instead of for just one, and you know, hopefully play well, which I have been able to do, which is nice.

Q.   Sergio, your putting obviously is strength, and it was today.   Can you talk about your claw putting grip and how much more comfortable you are feeling with your success on the greens. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   I mean it's no secret to anybody that it has been quite good for the past three years, I would say, since 2011. 
I guess I have my days where I make more putts and others where I don't make as many. 
But you know, I like to practice normal, and it gives me a little bit better feel, and then of course, I bring the claw.   But you know, today was very nice.   Yesterday it wasn't as good.   But you know, overall it has been an improvement, which is nice.

Q.   Sergio, you weren't sure yesterday what number you would need on the weekend to win.   With no rain in the forecast, what do you think you're going to need tomorrow to be sitting here?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Still don't know.

Q.   No idea?
SERGIO GARCIA:   No.

Q.   How low?
SERGIO GARCIA:   If I shoot 62, I'll probably win, but I don't know.   It's just difficult to say.   The way the course is playing every day, it's playing harder and harder. 
You know, if it comes up with a little bit of wind and the greens getting crispy, like‑‑ a little bit crusty like they are at the moment, you know, it's not going to be easy tomorrow.   So I don't know, maybe 3‑under might be enough.   Maybe you need 6.   You never know what the rest of the people are going to do.   The only thing I can do is go out there, try to play the best I can and hope that that is good and see where that puts me.
THE MODERATOR:   Anybody else?   Jason? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I'm disappointed about Spain, yes.

Q.   Is there a better comfort level for you at a course like this, tournament like this than there is maybe at a major championship where there's more focus, more pressure, more stress throughout the week?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I wouldn't say so.   Every week‑‑ every week there's pressure.   Winning is not easy.   And every week there's pressure to do well and give yourself a chance at winning. 
I guess if you would say, you know, you've never had a chance to win a major, then I could say maybe yes, but I have had my chances and I've been very close of doing it several times. 
So it's just a matter of keep putting yourself in that situation and wait for that day where you feel great, where everything goes your way, and you know, there's no one that can catch you.   Kind of like what Martin did last week, when it looked like he was going to be in trouble, he made an unbelievable bogey, for example, on Saturday and made sure that nobody else was getting close to him.   So you just gotta play the best you can and wait for that week where everything happens.

Q.   (No microphone). 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Great.   I think it's great for the TOUR, great for golf.   It's interesting to see how he is, how he's feeling.   I guess that obviously he wants to be as ready as possible for the British Open and wants to have maybe a little bit of a try, but yeah, no, it's obviously very nice to see him come back, and hopefully he stays healthy. 
THE MODERATOR:   Okay.   Sergio, great playing today.   Appreciate your time. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Thank you.
