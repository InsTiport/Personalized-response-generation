Q. You were 2-down through 11 holes but then you win five of the next six.  How were you able to flip this match on the back nine?
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, it was quite simple.  Obviously Xander played amazing on the front nine.  I want to say he made three or four putts over 20 feet on me.  I played okay.  I made a couple of mistakes on 6 with a wedge, par-5.  A little bit too aggressive and I wasn't able to get up-and-down.
I just kept giving myself chances.  I felt like he gave me a couple of openings and I hit some good shots.  I obviously made -- you can't really count 17 as a birdie because I had a 30-footer.  But I made four birdies coming in on the back nine and that's what kind of changed the match.
Q. For the first time in this format, you made it to the knockout round on the weekend.  What does that mean to you, especially here in your adopted hometown?
SERGIO GARCIA: Well, it means that I should have switched to make it into the weekend.  It's as simple as that.
It's fun to be here.  It's fun to -- we have so many friends here now.  To be able to make it into the weekend so they can watch us play, it's fun.
