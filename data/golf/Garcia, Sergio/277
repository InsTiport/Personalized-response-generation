Q.   Nice finish, good to hole one of those at the end? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, always great to finish with a birdie.   Just, I don't know, just been a hard week.   Hit the ball poorly, very poorly.   But I managed to more than anything putt very, very well and that's probably why I'm where I am.   So hopefully I can hit the ball a little bit better on the weekend, because if I keep hitting it like this, it's going to be difficult to get away with it every single time.

Q.   It was nice you had the better conditions today. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, definitely, definitely.   We definitely got the good side of the draw.   So that was nice.   That was nice to see.   But hopefully I'll play a little bit better on the weekend and keep putting the way I've been putting, which has definitely been my best club this week.   You know, we'll see where that takes us.
