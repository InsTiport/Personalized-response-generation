  SERGIO GARCIA:   I just wasn't comfortable.   I wasn't able to trust myself as I did the first few days.   It was hard, but I tried‑‑ I still tried as hard as I could the last four holes I felt like I played quite well.  
But overall, I think it's been a good week.   Very, very positive things from the first three rounds.
