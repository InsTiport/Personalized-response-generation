 Q. You needed a low one today, how does it feel to get just that?
 SERGIO GARCIA: It's good. The day didn't start the way we expected it playing the first. And then I hit a good second shot into 2 with a driver and plugged it in the face of the bunker, if that's possible. Didn't manage to birdie that. 
 But after that I played pretty consistent. I hit a lot of greens and made some nice birdies. And got on a good stretch on the back nine with three birdies in a row, put me in a decent position for the weekend.

 Q. Are you learning more about this course with each round you've played, playing a practise round and two in the tournament?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, definitely. Every time you play a course for the first time, it's funny how you hit a drive, you hit a tee shot and you know it's going where you want to hit it but you are still looking at it, because you don't what to expect on the bounces and things like that. 
 But yeah, as the week goes on, I think we are getting a little bit more used to it, and we are trying to figure it out a little better.

 Q. Is there a different vibe to this tournament than normally was for the Volvo Masters, the season finale normally? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Is it? I don't know. I loved the Volvo Masters at Valderrama. I thought that was an unbelievable course to finish the year at. 
 This is a good tournament, but you know, for me, it was always fun to finish at my home in Spain, my home country.
