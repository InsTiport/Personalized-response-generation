Q.   Match didn't turn out as you hoped?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, disappointed.   My partner was trying really hard, and we got back to all‑square, and then I started spraying it all over the place and lost a couple holes.   Then we had two or three good putts to win holes, and unfortunately we didn't make‑‑ it was just a little too late.

Q.   Yesterday you felt the ecstasy of The Ryder Cup and today you felt the agony; how bad is it? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It's a big difference.   You don't feel that proud when you lose a point.   In a game where I thought we would get something out of it, it's pretty painful. 
It's pretty painful; when you are in a game that you have a chance to go all the way to 18, or you get something out of it, it's a big difference.   It's very, very painful. 

Q.   Sergio's chip was magical at the 16th; did you think that might turn it in your favor? 
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Of course.   We get to one with two to go, and all of a sudden we have a decent chance to go to 18 and get something out of it.   It's just one of those moments where you feed a few Ryder Cups under your belt.
