Q. Another phenomenal performance in that match against Jim Furyk.SERGIO GARCÃA: It's funny, but you know, I felt so bad all week, uncomfortable, like I felt like I was letting my teammates down a little bit, not playing as well as I've been playing all year. Today I felt better.  I hit a couple wayward shots here and there but felt much better, felt a lot calmer.  Looked like my thoughts were a little bit clear, and the feeling was just amazing, the last four or five holes.  It was unbelievable.Q. There was tears in your eyes down 17, what does it mean, The Ryder Cup is Europe's again; what does it mean for to you win it on Scottish soil?SERGIO GARCÃA: It's amazing.  I'm going to try.  I very rarely cry and I couldn't hold it in.  This event is so special.  You know, I've been so fortunate to be able to play so many and do fairly well.  I just couldn't be happier.Q. And for Captain McGinley, fantastic captain?SERGIO GARCÃA: It was amazing.  He's been so methodical, every single aspect that he needed to touch on, he did.  Very, very inspiring.  You know, it was really -- I've been fortunate to have a lot of great captains, but Paul was -- he did things a little bit different but he did it with great style.Q. What kind of things did he do different?SERGIO GARCÃA: I think that he kind of probably brought a little bit more modern kind of captaincy to it.  You know, really, really taking care of every single detail; knowing that what we had before was good and it worked and just trying to improve it a little bit without changing it. So I think he did a great job.  He did an amazing job.  He was -- not even this week; he's been on me for some months now.  He told me how much I meant for him to be on his Ryder Cup Team, and that's probably one of the things that helped me play so well this year.
