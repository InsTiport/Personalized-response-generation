Q.   Six birdies on the day, 5â€‘under, you had great control of your game out there, tell us about it a little bit. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I guess I hit the ball quite nicely.   I hit a good amount of fairways, a lot of greens, three of the par 5s in two. 
So yeah, and the weather conditions were great.   It was just a little breeze.   So if you were swinging the ball well, you could score out there.

Q.   Was the breeze and the wind the major difference from the scoring conditions, as opposed to yesterday, from today, primarily? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, yesterday in the afternoon, the greens were firmer.   They were a little bit spikier.   And also, it was a bit breezier.   So it was definitely tougher yesterday. 

Q.   When you shoot a round like this, what sort of confidence does it do for you for the rest of the way as you head towards the weekend here at Bay Hill Club? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Not much.   I think that you go day by day, and I'll try to do the same thing tomorrow and hopefully shoot another good round.   But if I don't, then the confidence from these days doesn't work at all.
