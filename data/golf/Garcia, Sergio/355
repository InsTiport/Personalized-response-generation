  SERGIO GARCÃA:   I wasn't hitting the best of shots, but somehow I found a way of getting the ball in play and hitting a couple decent iron shots, gave myself good birdie chances on 11 and 12 and 15, and rolled a good putt in to get things going.   
   
 Q.   What is this course like‑‑  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I think it's great for this kind of format.   You know, when it gets windy like this, it would be difficult to play if you're a little bit off your game, it feels like you might not be able to finish.   But in this format, I guess it makes up for that.   
   
 Q.   You made a statement at the Masters that you haven't got the game to win a major; we were staggered by that.   Was that heat of the moment or do you genuinely feel that?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, it was obviously a little bit of the heat of the moment, but at the same time, that's the way I was feeling at that point.   Because, you know, I've been 13 years around here, and it hasn't happened to me.   You know, at the moment, the way I'm hitting the ball, there's no chance of winning a major.   Hopefully I'll get better and I have my chances so hopefully I'll get some more and, you know, get lucky one day and win.   
   
 Q.   You're not on your game but match play, you have a great record, how much do you think that's carrying you through, two great wins over good players.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I obviously got a little bit fortunate because neither of my playing partners played great the first two days.   I got on a good run today after starting poorly the first seven holes.   
Overall I think it was a mix of hitting a couple of good shots at the right times, and getting a little bit lucky.   
   
 Q.   Or you're good at match play.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   If you think about it, you know, I guess throughout my career, I've been fairly good at match play.   As a professional, maybe not as good but as an amateur I was usually pretty good.   It's nice to get a couple of wins and hopefully we'll play well tomorrow and have a chance of winning again.
