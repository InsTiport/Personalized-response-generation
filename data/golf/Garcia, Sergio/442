 Q. 3-under par, well done in tough conditions today. You even had the jacket on coming in. 
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Yeah, it got a little chilly. It was good. I felt like I played well. I felt like I played consistent. Hit some really good shots. Hit some good putts. Made a couple nice putts on the front nine. 
 It wasn't playing easy. With this course, you don't need the rough to be six inches or ten inches high just to play tough. Just a little wind and it takes care of itself. 

 Q. When you made that 32-foot putt on the front nine, what were you thinking?
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Well, I was happy to do it. I was happy to see that ball go in. I knew the course wasn't giving anything away. 
 I still felt like I played great on the back nine, and I shot 1-over. That tells you everything about this course, and the last four or five holes are quite tough. I was happy to finish 3-under, and it's a good start.
