 Q.  Tough day.  Smiles at the end, there, but I've got to ask you about hole 7.  Can you give us your idea of how things transpired?  
SERGIO GARCIA: It's quite simple.  I screwed it up, it's as simple as that.  Obviously I missed my putt and I kind of tapped it with the back of my putter before he said anything.  Yeah, it's a loss of hole.  I understand that.  The only issue that it was, was that Kooch was like, I didn't see it good, but I don't want to take the hole.  I don't want to do this like this.  So I was like okay, it's fine, what do you want to do?  Because there are many options that you can do if you don't want to take the hole, even though I've already lost that hole.  But obviously he didn't like any of the options that were there.   
It's fine.  At the end of the day, I'm the one that made the mistake.
