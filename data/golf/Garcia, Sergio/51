Q. You knew the Americans were going to come back this afternoon.
ALEX NOREN: Yeah, it would have been great to get another chance on 17, but you know, they played better than us.  So that's how it went.
Q. Bit of a grind at times, you both fighting back and forth all the way through there.
SERGIO GARCIA: Yes, we know they are very strong, and we know anything can happen in match play.  But playing with Alex here, we played very well and now we have to focus for tomorrow.
