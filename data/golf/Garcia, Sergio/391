  Q. How was your weekend?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, a little bit of a shame. I think that I had a really tough back nine yesterday and today I actually played better than I thought I was going to play and I putted horrible.   
 So you know, it's not great, but.  
  
  Q. Still a confidence builder then?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Oh, there was some positive things, but unfortunately it's easy to think about negative things on this course and that's the way it was this week and throughout the weekend, I guess.  
  
  Q. Your next event here in the States?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Wells Fargo.
