 Q.  The sixth straight point for Europe in this Ryder Cup.  How would you describe the emotions of this match?  
SERGIO GARCÃA: I think you could see there on the last putt.  It was great.  I think we played really, really well.  We gelled extremely well because a couple of times, he was out of the hole.  I made par, a good par or birdie.  When I was out of the hole, he made a couple of great birdies.  I think we gelled, and that's what you need in fourballs.   
I've always enjoyed playing with Rory.  He knows that.  He's a good friend, and today wasn't any different.   
 Q.  Speaking about being good friends, you guys get along very well off the golf course.  On the golf course, you're a very good team.  When you have somebody who can pick you up when you're down or vice versa, what is the mentality going into the day?  
RORY McILROY: Yeah, it's very important, especially for me, I didn't have my best stuff out there again this morning, but any time I didn't hit a great shot Sergio was always on my shoulder with encouragement telling me to come on, and that's great to hear that from someone like him; and his passion and fire for The Ryder Cup is second to none and it's pretty infectious.  We had a great time out there.
