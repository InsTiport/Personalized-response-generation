  SERGIO GARCIA:   But I don't know, I'd love to feel a little bit different out there on the course.   You know, I'd love to feel a little bit more‑‑ with a bit more energy, probably with what this tournament deserves.   
But unfortunately, I had to play where I had to play, and it's kind of dragging on a little bit.   But we'll try to hopefully find an avenue to play decent the next two days and then rest up.  
   
 Q.   With that said, you had a pretty good day out there today.   You had to be pretty satisfied with the score.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I didn't feel like I played that great.   I managed to score nicely, I guess.   I had some good up and downs early in the round and then made a couple nice birdies towards the back.   
Overall, it was a good day.   It's a difficult golf course even though the conditions were really, really nice.   Every time you shoot under par or around par on this golf course, you're never happy with that.     
   
 Q.   A few tournaments that ends on a par 3.   Talk about that.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   I mean, I don't know.   It doesn't really bother me.   I guess the great thing about that is that you know you're hitting‑‑ no matter what, you know you're hitting from the fairway.   
So obviously, it's a long par 3, but it doesn't‑‑ I guess it doesn't really bother me that much, I guess.
