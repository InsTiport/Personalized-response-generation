 Q.   Was it a day of what could have been?  
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, I would say so.   Obviously I can be a little bit disappointed with the score.   I don't think I can be disappointed with the way I played.   Even the last shot, I thought I hit a nice shot, tried to draw it a little bit with a 9‑iron and the wind just didn't hold it at all and unfortunately went in the water.   
    But you know, we managed to make a good up‑and‑down for bogey, and you know, hopefully the putts that didn't want to go in today will go in tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   How hard, me standing there and watching you guys, how hard are these things to read?   
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   They are hard, and obviously they are not perfect.   Sometimes you hit a good putt that looks like it's going to go in and it just dribbles at the end.   
    Obviously 15, for example, we pretty much have the same putt, he was a foot away farther, a foot farther from me, and you know, he hit his putt, pretty much went dead straight.   I hit mine and it broke half a cup to the right.   Sometimes you can't control those things.   
    But if you give it your best and you feel like you've put a good effort on it, you know, the other things you can't control.   
   
 Q.   You've won many tournaments around the world.   Wood has not won on The European Tour, he's three shots in front.   What's he feeling and what have you got to do to catch this young man?  
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, I think I have to play pretty much as well as I did today and hopefully drop some more of those birdie putts.   I don't know how he is but obviously tomorrow it will be a big day for him; if he goes out there and plays well, he'll probably win.   If not, he'll have to work it out and suffer it.   
    The only thing I can do, the only thing I can control is my game and hopefully I'll go out there tomorrow and play as well as I did the last two or three days and put a good score on.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on how round three has mapped out?   
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, I don't know, I think I feel like I played well.   I feel like I played as well as yesterday, and it could have probably easily been a 66 or a 67 today, but unfortunately some of the putts didn't want to drop and then we didn't have the best of finishes.   
    So overall, I still feel happy about the way I played and I just have got to give it one more try tomorrow and hopefully that will be good enough.  
   
 Q.   It's not often that you have to look through a camera lens on the last and check a point of entry, but not likely to prove too costly, is it?   
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, what was costly was that I felt like I hit a good shot and unfortunately it went in the water.   But no, those are the things that happen, and I was able to get up‑and‑down, and make a good six, if there is any time a good six on a par 5.   You know, hopefully we'll go out there tomorrow and play well.  
   
 Q.   I'm sure the answer is obvious, but what is necessary tomorrow?   Do you feel a low round in you again?   
    SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, if I want to win, if the weather is like it's been the whole week, I'm probably going to need, yeah, a good round, somewhere in the mid 60s.   
    We'll see.   The only thing I can do is give my best effort and try as hard as I can and hopefully if it happens, great.   If not, we'll take what comes.
