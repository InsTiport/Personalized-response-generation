  RORY McILROY: Very disappointed, but just got to pick ourselves up this afternoon and make up for it.   Q.  It was a tough battle out there, wasn't it?  RORY McILROY: Tough battle.  The wind was a little tricky.  Felt like we played decent golf.  It was a little scrappy at times but we fought until the end.  Obviously a little disappointed that neither of us made birdie at the last.   SERGIO GARCÃA: Yeah, well, you know, unfortunately obviously I didn't think neither of the four of us played especially well.  It was tough conditions. I don't know, probably the fairest thing would have been a draw, but you're not supposed to be fair here.  They played the last two par 5s well, and they beat us.  The only thing we can do is regroup and hopefully play a little bit better this afternoon and get it back.   Q.  Nice to get a chance to go straight back out?  SERGIO GARCÃA: Yeah, obviously it's not nice to lose the way we were, but it is what it is.  You've got to hit the right shots at the right times, and unfortunately we weren't quite on today.
