 Q. Thoughts on your final round for today?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, well, I felt like I played pretty decent.   Front nine I was quite good, gave myself a lot of chances.   Unfortunately the putts didn't want to drop.   Then finally started making some birdies on 5, 7 and 9, and I just had a really bad break on 10, hit my tee shot a little left and hit the cart path, and the ball kind of disappointed.   That one kind of put me a little bit behind the 8‑ball, had to do something really, really extremely good coming in, and there were some tough holes.   12 and 13 were playing quite tough.   Even 18 wasn't that easy to make a birdie.   
 You know, but I felt like I fought quite hard, and obviously Ryan played really, really well.   He hit two or three really good shots coming in that gave him a little bit of extra room to maneuver with, and he deserved it.  
 Q.   Was there a point in the round at which you thought you could claim a title?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, after 9 I thought I had a chance.   I thought if I can hit a decent tee shot on 10 or even make birdie on 10, even missing the fairway, which you can do, I thought I had a chance because I finally got some things going after two or three lip‑outs early in the round for birdie.   But unfortunately that double bogey kind of stopped me a little bit.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on the event?   Do you think in the future it will attract more players to the CIMB Classic?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, hopefully.   I think the tournament is good.   The golf course is nice.   Hopefully.   Hopefully it will attract more and more high players as the years go on.   But I can't see the future, so we'll see.
