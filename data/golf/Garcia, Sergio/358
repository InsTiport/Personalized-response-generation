  SERGIO GARCIA:   There's two ways to look at it, I guess.   I think that it was a good finish.   Unfortunately, obviously, when we got going nicely after 11 today, we had a chance of winning, and unfortunately that ‑‑ you know, things didn't kind of go our way. 
You know, so I think that there's some good things.   There's obviously some things that need to be better, but overall it was okay, I guess.

Q.   Well, you looked irresistible when those birdies were dropping, and I fancy that you thought I've got a realistic chance here?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I did.   I did have a chance.   I was 10‑under.   I was one shot behind Paul, and I did have a chance.   I needed probably to make three more birdies, which was doable.   14 was a hole that you could birdie. 
16 and 18 were birdie holes.   17, if you hit a good shot, you can make birdie.   So it was definitely doable.   Unfortunately, things kind of started going the wrong way, and putts started not dropping, and that's the way it goes.

Q.   Just the nature of the game, isn't it?   14th derailed you a little. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I wouldn't say it derailed me.   It kind of stopped my momentum, and from then on, don't get me wrong, I hit some great putts coming in, and unfortunately all the putts that seemed to be dropping in until 13 now they were lipping out or burning the edge, and unfortunately that's what happens.

Q.   I guess like all of us you look for pointers at the start of the year, so overall, it's good, good foundation for the year?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   No, I definitely think that there's been some good things.   Obviously there's some things that I need to get better at, but there's been some good positive things.
