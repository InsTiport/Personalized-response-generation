  Q.  East Lake has given up some low scores today, including yours in the third round.   
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Yes, funny enough, we know the greens are soft because of all the rain and everything that's happened to them.  But still, it wasn't easy out there.  It was quite windy.   
 The good thing is you knew when you were in the fairway you were going to be able to stop the ball nicely, so that made a little bit of a difference.  But still, you still have to play well to shoot a good score.  Looks like a lot of guys did that.   
  
  Q.  Soft greens sometimes mean bumpy greens, but you rolled it well.   
 SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, I putted nicely.  I hit a lot of good putts.  I've been getting better and better every week with my putting, and today was nice.  I made a couple long ones, so it felt good for a change.   
  
  Q.  You'd have to go low on Sunday in order to win, but you're capable of low scores.   
 SERGIO GARCIA:  It's not looking great.  The problem is it all depends on myself, and unless I shoot 56 or something like that, it's going to be tough.
