Q. Following what was a long day, Sergio, how do you think you performed out there today?
SERGIO GARCIA: I thought I did quite well.  I probably didn't feel like I was swinging 100 percent, but I still managed to hit a lot of greens and hit a good amount of fairways.  So I thought I did quite well.
Q. Such a mental grind out there for the U.S. Open in general, and tomorrow it's going to be a physical grind because you have to come back out early and then finish the final round.  What mentality do you have heading into that what might be --
SERGIO GARCIA: It's the same as each day.  We played 36 every single day.  It's obviously a tough golf course, but you've got to go out there and believe in yourself as much as possible.  Obviously, there's going to be moments where it's going to be tough because this golf course is very difficult.  But you've got to stay patient and wait for your moments and try to make sure that the mistakes you make, they're not too big.
Q. Final thing.  Whether it's mentally, mechanically, or strategically, what do you think you have to do tomorrow to ultimately win that major championship?
SERGIO GARCIA: I don't know.  I think I have to keep playing well and keep giving myself chances.  I was playing with Shane today, and he played really, really well.  There's still a lot of holes to be played.  Hopefully, I'll be able to play well, and I'll have a shot in the last round.
