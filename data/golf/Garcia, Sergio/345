  JOHN BUSH:   We'd like to welcome Sergio Garcia into the interview room here at the Barclays.   Sergio, coming off of the win last week at the Wyndham Championship, your eighth win on the PGA TOUR, two of which came at this event.   Take us back to the event last week and talk about how you're feeling heading into the Playoffs.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   Well, like you said, I had a good week last week where I managed to do things fairly well.   I got a nice win and kind of was able to achieve a couple big things.   Obviously playing well coming into the Playoffs, and at the same time, securing my Ryder Cup spot for Chicago, which was huge for me.   Very excited about that.   
   
 Q.   I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about a couple of holes on the back nine, the 13th hole, the par‑5, long par‑5, kind of a double dogleg.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Here?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   I haven't practiced here yet.   I played obviously twice before, but I don't know exactly how it's playing at the moment.  
   
 Q.   So you haven't been out on the course?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   No.   
   
 Q.   Around this time two years ago you said, "I'm not happy out on the golf course; I'm not going to lie."   How did you get from that point to getting back into the winning circle here?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I think that you go through spots and through times in your career where obviously you have up and downs.   And when you go on those downs obviously it's not much fun.   But you kind of try to get through them.   I guess that's why we love the game so much.   
You know, it's a hard game, but it's also‑‑ when you can do a couple things right, it gives a lot back to you.   You just kind of keep practicing, keep trying hard, and just kind of wait for the right times to come around.   You know, it's pretty much as simple as that.   
   
 Q.   You've always had success here in this area even though the fans haven't always been kind to you‑‑  
SERGIO GARCIA:   What do you mean?   They've been great.  
   
 Q.   Well, once in a while you get some stuff.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, not at all.  
   
 Q.   Is there anything about New York that gets you going?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I've always enjoyed playing around here.   I think that the fans are very rowdy, but at the same time, they're very, very sports‑related and sports‑driven.   It's always exciting to come back to New York.   Like you said, I think I've done very, very well here in this area.   I do like the courses they have around here.   I think they're very blessed with the golf courses and all the spots that they have around here.   They're very beautiful.   
I've always felt comfortable around here, and I'm just hoping that this week it'll be no different.   Hopefully I can ride a bit of that momentum from last week and see if we can have another good week.  
   
 Q.   It's been a few years since you've been here, but what do you remember specifically about this place, this course?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I mean, I really like the course.   The other thing I feel‑‑ not regret, but I love to play the course the way it's supposed to play, fast and firm.   It would be nice to see it‑‑ both times we've played it it's been very, very wet, and the course isn't as tough.   It plays a little bit easier that way.   So it would be nice to see if we get decent weather, which it looks like we might have, and hopefully the course plays it's the way it's supposed to be, and then we can really see how the real teeth of Bethpage Black.   It'll be nice to be able to experience that.   
   
 Q.   Since your win on Sunday, have you heard from Europe's captain and what did he say to you?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, he was one of the first to call me, but not only on Monday.   He's always called me to see how I'm doing, even before he was Ryder Cup captain.   But obviously with the Ryder Cup coming along, he's very concerned about me and how am I feeling and more about the game and how I'm feeling mentally and emotionally.   
No, he was one of the first to call me and congratulate me, and he was very happy for making his job a little bit easier.   He's excited to have me in the team, and he's looking forward to it.   
   
 Q.   You used a local caddie last week in Greensboro.   I just wanted to know what are your plans for this week and going forward?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I'm going to have Wayne Richardson that's a good friend of mine.   He's not a professional caddie, but I don't feel like I need that at the moment.   I'm probably just going to do my own thing until the end of the year, and then at the end of the year I'll decide what's best for me.  
   
 Q.   What about for the Ryder Cup?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Same thing.   Doesn't change anything.  
   
 Q.   Would you use a local caddie at Medinah?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   No.   I'll see who I use.   
   
 Q.   I was just wondering, do you feel the playoff format kind of extending the season a little bit later kind of helps you and/or the Americans in their preparations for the Ryder Cup?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know.   We'll see.   Hopefully it helps us more than they do.   But I don't know, it's five weeks still to the Ryder Cup, six weeks.   So we'll see.   
But there's definitely a lot of tournaments, so I'm going to have to probably pace myself a little bit.   I want to make sure that my energy levels are the right way going into the Ryder Cup, so we'll see what we do.   
   
 Q.   There's obviously some bad blood between Padraig Harrington and JosÃ© MarÃ­a and there's a lot of people that think that even if Harrington is playing better and should be the second pick, he wouldn't be because of what happened at the Seve Trophy in '03.   What's your thoughts on the possibility of not getting the best team out there if he decided not to take Harrington?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I'm sure that JosÃ© is going to pick whoever he thinks is best for the team.   I mean, I don't know if that includes Harrington or not.   So we'll see.   I mean, I can't speak for both of them.   I know that JosÃ© is going to do the best thing for the team, and if that includes Harrington, it'll be fine.   If not, there's a lot of other guys that are playing very, very well, too.   I don't think he's a sure pick.   He wouldn't be a sure pick for me.   
   
 Q.   You put yourself in contention a lot this year, only to have one bad round be your undoing, at THE PLAYERS, at Doral, at Bay Hill.   What was going on then, and does it have anything to do with what you were talking about last week about having a caddie and maybe listening too much to that extra voice and relying too much on it?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, I wouldn't say that that was the main reason.   Obviously there's some rounds where you feel better and some rounds where you feel a little bit worse.   The main thing, obviously there's a couple situations here and there where you wish would have done things differently and you would have made a better decision.   But at the end of the day, I think it comes down to myself and how I'm feeling.   At the end of the day, I'm the one that's hitting the shots.   So if I'm comfortable with what I'm doing, I should be fine.   If not, then I'll probably‑‑ it probably becomes a little bit tougher.   
You know, just mainly that.   
JOHN BUSH:   Sergio, we appreciate your time.   Play well this week.
