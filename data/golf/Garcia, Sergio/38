SERGIO GARCIA: Very intense.  Obviously Grace started really well.  Then it got really tricky.  When this kind of weather came in, it got very, very difficult.  I managed to make three really good putts, so that obviously shows me a lot.  And it's going to be a tough match this afternoon.  But I'm excited to be here.
