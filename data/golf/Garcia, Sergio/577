Q.  How did it go, Sergio, a bit disappointed?
SERGIO GARIA:  Yeah, definitely.  I'm not going to lie, I mean, I am disappointed.  But what can I do?  I wasn't good enough, and you know, it's always    the good thing is there's always room for improvement.  That's what you've got to take back to your house and think about.  You know, I tried my hardest and unfortunately, I wasn't able to do it.  But, you know, that's what happens.  Sometimes you want it so badly that you almost try too hard.
Q.  Does this feel worse than last year?
SERGIO GARCIA:  No, pretty much about the same.  I think that the positive thing about last year is that I did play very consistently in the last round and I had a chance of winning it.

This year, unfortunately, I didn't get that last putt to have a chance of winning, or at least getting into a playoff.  But I felt like as bad as everything started, I still kept my composure pretty nicely.  I never threw it away and I tried hard.  Unfortunately, just hit a couple of bad shots that cost me a lot.  That's the way it is.  I fought hard coming in and unfortunately couldn't make a couple of putts when I needed them.  That's what you get.
