 Q.  What did you think of the start?  
SERGIO GARCIA: I mean, the conditions were great, no doubt about it.  Probably some of the best conditions I've played in an Open.  It's a good score for sure.  I'm not going to say no to that, but I didn't feel like I played well at all.  I hit some good shots, obviously, but my swing didn't feel too compact.  I scrambled nicely.  I need to obviously play better the next three days if I want to be up there.   
 Q.  Are you mindful of getting a good score when the weather's expected to worsen?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I mean, we'll see.  We'll see what will happen in the next three days.  But obviously today was a good day to be able to shoot a good score.  That's why I'm a little bit disappointed that I didn't hit the ball a little bit better and maybe shot 5- or 6-under.  But at the same time, I'm very happy with the way I fought and without feeling comfortable at all, I still managed to shoot 3-under, which could have been 4-under.  Hit a good putt on 17; unfortunately it didn't break.  Overall, I guess I'm happy with the day.   
 Q.  Is that frustrating when you see there's been some good scores out there, Phil, for example, does that frustrate you?  
SERGIO GARCIA: No, no, not at all.  It's frustrating for me that I didn't play more like the way I know how to play.  But, frustrating because someone else shot a great round?  No.  Of course, shooting 63 in a major championship it's amazing and you've got to congratulate Phil for doing it.  I'm sure he played awesome.   
 Q.  Nine years after Carnoustie, you must be pleased to be at the forefront of the European championship.  It is a start.  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it is a decent start.  Obviously, I felt like it was the kind of day that you could really, if you played well, like we saw with some of the guys, you could put a really good score.  Even though the back nine were benign conditions, it's still not easy.   
But like I said, I'm happy about the way I fought, and it was a round of the way I was feeling it could have been 73 or 74 and ended up being a 68.  So that's good.
