Q.  Talk about your round a little bit.
SERGIO GARCIA:  To be sincere, I think I played like crap.  I didn't play very good at all.  I didn't drive the ball great, hit a couple wacky iron shots, but I made a couple nice putts at the beginning when I was struggling, got me going a little bit.  I guess I managed to put a half a decent round.  Overall, not too bad, but I can definitely play much better than I did today.
