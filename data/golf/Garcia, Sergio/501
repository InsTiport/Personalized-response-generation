  Q. Tell me about this golf course today.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: It's set up really perfect, because it's playing tough. You can't miss a fairway. The rough is really thick. So you pretty much have no chance of getting it to the green. And then the greens are probably the fastest greens we have played in a long time.   
 So even though I played well, it felt like you couldn't -- you didn't. There were very little chances of giving yourself a putt that you could go for. Every putt felt like it was like a conservative kind of stroke and it was difficult because even hitting soft putts, some of the downhill putts, hitting them even when we were hitting them soft, you're still running them by three and four feet.   
 So it's just not easy, but it's just unfortunately that double on the last, after all the work I did, you know, that didn't feel that good.   
  
  Q. That putt that you hit on 8 though was a great putt there.
