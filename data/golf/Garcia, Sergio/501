   SERGIO GARCIA: The course wasn't playing easy. I guess the changes, the length and the movement of the greens, it definitely made the course a lot tougher, and with this wind it was tough. 

 Q. Do you like the changes yourself?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I think the course is improved. I think some of the greens might be a little too severe, but overall I think it's definitely become a better course, and that was the goal. 

 Q. Compared to last year, was the sand in the bunkers difficult to work with?
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, it was fine. The bunkers are good. They did a good job this morning getting them ready. They were still in good shape. I had a plugged lie on 5 and 6 fairway, but other than that, they were pretty decent for the rain they had last night.

 Q. Did you think the improvements, changes that have been made here, would be enough to bring some of the other Top 10 golfers back to this tournament?
 SERGIO GARCIA: If it fits my schedule I'm going to come and play. I can't really answer what the rest of the guys are going to do.

 Q. Why do you like playing here? Why do you come back? 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I've won here before. That always helps. And I feel like the people always treat me very nicely here in Dallas, and I like the area. It's always nice to come back and play here.
