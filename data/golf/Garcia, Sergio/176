Q. How does it feel to be 10-under par?
SERGIO GARCIA: Didn't start very well.  First day I played terrible but I managed to score well.  Yesterday I played a little bit better, not great, in difficult conditions.
Today was definitely the best day I played.  I think I hit 16 greens, a couple par 3s, a couple par 5s in two.  I hit a lot of good putts that burned the edges.  I missed a couple short ones for birdies mainly.
But at least I had a good finish there with a good save on 17 and a nice birdie on the last.  So I'm happy with that.
Q. Do you get a sense that you've moved into at least a decent position?
SERGIO GARCIA: It's tough.  I'm still probably going to be at least five or six shots behind.  It's a lot of shots, I'm not going to lie.
When you're that far back, you don't rely on yourself anymore, because you can shoot 64 and the other guy shoots 68 and you're still losing.  You rely on an unbelievable round from yourself, probably like a 62 or a 63 and something not too great from the leaders.
But there's a lot of guys in between, so it's going to be tough, but we'll give it a shot.
Q. Do you get a sense that there is a 64 or 62 within you?
SERGIO GARCIA: It's definitely there because the course is soft and how much rain we've got and we're playing lift, clean and place.  So you can definitely see -- I could definitely have shot it today, the way I played, but unfortunately I didn't and I probably needed it to be really, really in contention.
Q. With The European Tour hat, are you conscious of The Final Series and plenty to play for?
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, obviously there's a lot of things to play for, not only for The Final Series of The European Tour but also for my season next year in the U.S.
So at the end of the day, the only thing I can do is go out there and play the best I can and give it my best shot and see where that puts me at.
