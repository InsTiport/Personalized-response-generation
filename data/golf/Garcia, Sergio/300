  SERGIO GARCIA:   I guess the issue was that someone called on my short putt on 17 for par saying that I marked the ball on the side and then put it in front, which would mean that I gained about an inch or an inch‑and‑a‑half. 
But what I did was I didn't want to step on Billy's line, which was behind me, so I kind of marked it behind the ball but from the side.   Then I put it straight up or straight down where I thought it was the same spot.   I thought I put it as close as I could, obviously, with the coin still behind the ball.   It looked like it might have moved a tiny bit, but the rules officials felt that obviously I didn't gain anything by it.   There are obviously a lot of times that you try to put it in exactly the same spot but it's difficult to do, not just for me, but for everyone.   They thought that it was fine. 
They would have said if I marked the ball from behind and then put the ball in front of the coin again; I didn't mark it from the side and then put it in front of the coin like maybe someone thought I did.

Q.   And you were out here for quite a while.   I heard you mentioning these guys how important it is to you to make sure the right decision was made.   You obviously feel like the right decision was made? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, I've always‑‑ the way my dad brought me up in golf and everything, he showed me that the game is the biggest thing.   There is no tournament, there is no player bigger than the game.   And I said if you guys feel like I gained something by, obviously, moving it‑‑ I don't know how much, like a centimeter or couple centimeters, whatever it is, I'm fine with the two‑stroke penalty.   I'd rather take the two‑stroke penalty than come out here like I was a cheater. 
Obviously, they felt that wasn't the case.   I told them exactly what I did, and they felt it was fine.   That's pretty much it.
