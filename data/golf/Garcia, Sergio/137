 Q.  Thoughts on the day?  
SERGIO GARCIA: I'm happy with it.  Obviously started very well and got it to 5.  Unfortunately I didn't hit a great shot on 4 and 3-putted that hole, and then I couldn't really make anything coming in.   
Obviously the greens are not great to look at, with the problems they have had and all this rain, they are quite bumpy and quite slow.  But we try to deal with it the best way possible.   
 Q.  And that was bound to happen, wasn't it, with all this rain and I take it that course is playing longer than it usually does.  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, they did move a couple of tees up here and there.  But yeah, it's very wet.  It's obviously extremely wet out there and it is what it is.  Unfortunately this is the weather we have, and we have to deal with it the best way possible.   
 Q.  Does it help that you've performed so well here before?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Does it help -- obviously it does help a little bit.  It brings good memories from 2008.  Yeah, it definitely helps a little bit.  So we're happy with that.   
 Q.  I appreciate the course has changed, not only from that time to this, but across the intervening period.  But you probably know some of the nuances where to hit?  
SERGIO GARCIA: A little bit, yes.  We've been playing here for a long time now.  But the rough is a little bit thicker than it's been lately, so you obviously have to avoid it the best way possible.   
I managed to do that, other than a couple of holes.  But you know, it's just very wet out there and you've just got to try to putt it in play the best way possible.
