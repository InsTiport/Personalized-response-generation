Q.  Bad hole at No. 10, yeah?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Not really.  I played pretty poorly on the back nine.  I didn't hit many good shots.  I started really well.  I played solid the front nine, but I just hit a couple bad shots on 10.  After that, I don't know, I just couldn't really find it.  You know, finishing with a terrible second shot on 18 and wasn't able to birdie with the two irons in my hands. 
I'm a little disappointed with that, and just got to go out and practice a little bit, hopefully get it back into shape.

Q.  What element was missing today?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know, I just wasn't hitting the ball well.  If I would have known, I would have changed it and then it would have been better.  But unfortunately I couldn't find it.

Q.  On 9, you decided to go with the flop shot, was that a tough decision?
SERGIO GARCIA:   I just realized, the other way, it was too tough to hit it close and I had to hit a perfect shot.  Even if I hit the perfect shot, I was probably going to be pretty much where I was with the flop shot.  I figured if I hit a really good flop shot I should be able to hit it close.  If I hit it a little too hard, it's going to stay there and I'm still going to have a chance of saving par.

Q.  Does this course suit your game?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, it should, but unfortunately not today.

Q.  At the PGA you had that epic battle with Tiger, and today he was playing a couple of groups behind you, when you hear a roar, does that motivate you knowing that Tiger just did something?  Do you take note of that at all?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Not really, no.
