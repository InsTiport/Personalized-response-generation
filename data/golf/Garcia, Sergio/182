 Q.  Tell us about a lovely round of 64.  
SERGIO GARCIA: It was nice.  Obviously played nicely.  Conditions were quite good, not much wind.  A little bit of a drizzle but other than that it was good.  The course is nice.  I drove the ball very well and that gave me a lot of opportunities to hit some good iron shots.  Yeah, it was a nice round.   
 Q.  From the word go, got off to a lovely start on the front nine and another lovely one on your back nine?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yes, I did.  I had a couple nice birdies -- three birdies in the first four on my front nine and then another three or four birdies on the first four or five on the back nine.   
Yeah, it's the kind of round that you are looking for.   
 Q.  Has it helped already having a week inform your belt in ^  Shanghai to get acclimatised as well as laying well at Sheshan?  
SERGIO GARCIA: No, I wouldn't say so.  It's just a matter of feeling a bit more comfortable, a bit better.  Obviously had a couple of rounds last week where I felt like I played better than I did in Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur.  You know, hopefully I keep improving as the week goes on, and we'll be out there on Sunday having a chance.   
 Q.  You jumped the gun, it's only one round, but do you have an indication of maybe what the target is now?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Not really.  I'm going to try to shoot the lowest I can and I don't know what that's going to be, to tell you at the end of the week.
