Q. Sergio, what a moment, what a reaction from the fans.  How sweet was that putt for you?
SERGIO GARCÃA: It was amazing.  I think we played great all day.  Obviously they started coming hard at us the last few holes, a couple little mistakes here and there, but you know, we knew that we just had to keep giving ourselves chances and you know, the way we're playing -- it was great for him to make that, gave me a little more freedom and great to roll it in.
Q. What relief did you feel walking off 17?
RORY McILROY: Yeah, 4-up, five to play, you're thinking win the 14th and get this thing over and done with, and then to be going up 17, it's not what you want, but you know, we tried to just make the best of the situation and I mean, Sergio was so clutch.  It's great.  We played together at Gleneagles, and obviously we enjoy each other's company, but we love coming out here, and the fire and the passion that he has, it's infectious, and it rubs off on me pretty well.
