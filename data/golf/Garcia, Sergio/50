 Q.  Well played today.  A move up that leaderboard, how do you reflect on day two here in Dubai?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it was a nice day.  Obviously could have been a really good day.  I felt like I played nicely.  Gave myself a lot of chances.  A couple putts here and there that just didn't want to drop.   
But other than that, at least we shoot a good round and we moved a little bit up the leaderboard, and hopefully the guys behind don't get too far in front.   
 Q.  You've been playing well coming off The Ryder Cup, Valderrama, which was another sweet moment for you; last week.  How high is the confidence right now, how high?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Game feels good.  Obviously we're starting to get a little bit tired at the end of the year and excited to hopefully have a good week here and a good week next week in Hong Kong and then put the clubs away for a little bit.   
But you know, the game has been feeling nice.  Short game feels good.  Even some of the days that I'm not making as many putts, I feel like I'm hitting a lot of good putts, so that's all you can do.   
Overall, it's been a good second half of the year and we're excited to finish as low as possible.
