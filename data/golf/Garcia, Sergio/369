 Q. Can you talk about your round a little bit?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I guess a little bit disappointed, a little bit disappointed with the finish. Just didn't really play that great coming in. But overall I think it was pretty good. I obviously wasn't feeling my best, but we got it to 2-under, pretty good. I hit some good shots early on the back nine and then unfortunately I just wasn't that comfortable with the driver today, and it kind of paid off at the end. 

 Q. Talk about the bogey at 16. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: It wasn't only that, it was a bad tee shot on 15. We managed to make a great 4 there, and then obviously a couple of the swings with the driver kind of got in my head and I started worrying a little bit too much. I guess we'll work on it this afternoon. Hopefully I get it better, and we'll be ready for tomorrow. 

 Q. The first Open since Seve's passing, have you been thinking about him? And did you think about him out there at all?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Obviously, yeah, he did come to mind here and there. Obviously it's hard enough already, so you want to try to keep your attention on the right things. 
 But yeah, he obviously came to mind. Obviously he's not only going to be here, he's going to be very missed for a long, long time. You know, it's, I guess, way of life. 

 Q. He'd have enjoyed that great save you made from the right thick stuff. 
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it was quite tough, but we managed to get a good club on it. Unfortunately it came up quite a bit left and didn't have a great lie in the bunker. Hit a decent bunker shot and then rolled a really nice putt in. That was nice. It would have been nicer if I would have played a little bit better the last three holes, but that's the way it is.

 Q. Which hole was that?
 SERGIO GARCIA: 15.
