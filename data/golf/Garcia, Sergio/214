 Q.   How would you assess your round out there today?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   I felt like I played quite well.   Obviously I didn't hole a lot of putts.   I hit some really good putts that I had quite a lot of lip‑outs, but other than that, it felt good.   
I started well, obviously played a good Front 9, and then Back 9 I felt like I played pretty solid, gave myself some chances, and unfortunately I just wasn't able to convert, you know, like two or three of the putts on the Back 9.  
But other than that, it felt pretty good.  
   
 Q.   How did you feel the course was playing today?   Greens speed and‑‑  
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, pretty similar to last year, I guess.   Just a little bit softer, obviously, but other than that, quite similar to last year.   
It was a little bit breezier today, which we're not that used to seeing here, but overall it was nice.  
   
 Q.   So you feel you left a few shots out there?   Are you pretty happy overall?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah.   No, I definitely left some shots out there, but not because‑‑ you know, not because I didn't putt well or anything.   It just, it was one of those days where instead of lipping in, they seemed to lip out, and I probably had at least four or five putts that looked like they were going to go in, and didn't, and you know, I would have loved to play the par‑5s a little bit better, mainly on the Back 9, my 1 through 9 holes.   But other than that, it was okay.  
   
 Q.   How about the heat?   Does that become a factor?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   It does a little bit.   You start sweating and it becomes a little bit uncomfortable, your hands and stuff, but it's okay.   It's actually not too bad.   We've seen it much hotter than it is here, so we can't complain.
