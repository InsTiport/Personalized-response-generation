Q.   Sergio, not the finish you want on the 18th hole, but you come home in 30.   How were you able to turn your round around? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I think the front nine I didn't play great, but I didn't do too bad.   Just didn't give myself a lot of really birdie chances.   I was never really too close.   Then on the back nine I started hitting the ball a bit closer and gave myself some good birdie putts and an eagle putt.   I was able to make pretty much all of those, and, yeah, a little bit on 18 for the second shot I left myself in a terrible spot.   But overall I think the way I was feeling on the 10th tee, it's better.

Q.   How big a challenge is it from a week ago that grind to this week at the TPC River Highlands? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   It is a change, there is no doubt.   The course is different, and it's playing softer than it was playing last week, but you kind of you're used to it because you've done it year‑in and year‑out.

Q.   I know it wasn't the finish you were looking for, but that was a great back nine with those six birdies after an even par round at the front. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, a shame because when you hold a bogey‑free round to screw it up on the last hole is never nice.   But, like you said, I got in a good round there on the back nine, and I was happy to see that happening.   Hopefully somewhere around that tomorrow.

Q.   Any special adjustments you made with the putter for those results? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, not really.   I was just able to hit it a little closer on the back nine.   I hit a lot of shots that were a lot of my birdie putts were inside five feet.   So obviously when you manage to hit it like that, then your chances are a little better.

Q.   Haven't been here in a few years.   What do you think? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it's good.   No, it's a good course.   It would be nice to see it play a little bit firmer, but unfortunately, we had a little bit of rain this morning.   But the course is in good shape.   It's good to be back, and we'll see what we can do.

Q.   Talk about your round today, Sergio.   I know maybe 118 wasn't your favorite, but other than that, a pretty good round?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, unfortunately, I missed probably the worst putt I could miss there on 18 after a decent drive.   But yeah, I think that we're not going to‑‑ obviously, when you're 6‑under there, you don't want to finish with a bogey.   But if you had given me 3‑under on the 10th hole, I would have taken it, so five was still good.

Q.   Even through nine and you were just kind of going around.   What happened on that back nine that got you going? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Nothing special.   I just started hitting‑‑ I just started hitting a lot of shots close to the pin.   I hit it quite close on 10, which is not an easy hole, and made birdie.   Hit close on 11, missed it, and hit it to like three feet on 12.   Very close for eagle on 13.   15 chipped it to two feet, and the next hole I hit it to three feet, and then to a foot.   So when you give yourself those kind of chances, usually you can get a good run.

Q.   Sitting at 65, just three off the pace puts you in a good spot in this place going into the next three days. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, we'll see.   It's still a long week to go.   We'll see where we'll be tomorrow.   Hopefully we play well, and we keep ourselves up there and we'll have a chance.   If not, we'll have to scramble around it.
