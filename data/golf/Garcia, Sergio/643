SERGIO GARCIA:  It was the most painful thing -- it was the most painful golf to watch.  I played so bad.
Q.  Really?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Yeah, I did, but I managed to get around.  I hit a great shot on 9 and I holed it and that got me going a little bit.  But I still didn't hit a lot of good shots.

I hit some nice ones.  I hit a couple of good shots on 111 and a good shot on 13.  I played 14 pretty nicely.

But I was just hanging around there and I managed to actually shoot a pretty good 73.
Q.  How do you explain that after you played pretty well yesterday?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I played very well yesterday, but I don't know.  I didn't have the best of starts.  I hit a great drive on the 1st, and it just went through the fairway and it went down the middle and it was in the thick rough and I had no chance of stopping it, and I ended up making 5.  And I hit a really bad drive on 2 and hit the trees on the left, and it went on the right and it was a struggle.  That took a lot of confidence out of me.
