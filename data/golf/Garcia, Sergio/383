  Q. Are you happy with the round out there? 2-under par is normally a good position except for what Rory is doing.   
 SERGIO GARCIA: Am I happy? Yeah, obviously I am. I don't think I played very good today, so I think even par, the way I played, it was a good round. I would have loved to play obviously much better and been able to shoot 3- or 4-under. It was very possible today. But unfortunately the game wasn't there.   
  
  Q. Could you put into words what Rory is doing out there?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: He's just playing great, simple as that.   
  
  Q. Did you feel there were a lot of opportunities out there for you today that you were not able to capitalize on?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, I didn't hit it close enough. Obviously if you hit the ball well, there were a lot of good opportunities that you could leave yourself because the greens were soft because of the rain, the overnight rain. But if you're hitting it all over the shop, it's quite difficult to give yourself chances. You're kind of fighting to make pars.  
  
  Q. Based on what happened to Rory at Augusta, is there part of you that's actually sort of rooting for him?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Definitely. I think it would be great for him to win. He's a wonderful player, very nice kid. I get along very well with him, too. It would be nice. Even if what happened at Augusta would have not happened, it would be nice for him to win. I think he deserves it, and hopefully he'll be able to do it.  
  
  Q. Having to chase someone that's so far in the lead, does that change your plan of attack?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Not at all. I have bigger worries than Rory McIlroy.
