 Q. Sergio, how did that not go in on 18?
 SERGIO GARCIA: I wish I could blame it on that but, unfortunately, it happened before that. So, I gave it a good chance on 18. Unfortunately it didn't go in but I should have been in a different position.

 Q. The week as a whole for you?
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was good. It was a shame because today -- when I was at 18, I just couldn't get comfortable and, you know, the one on 11 bothered me quite a bit because it was one of my best things on the 6 iron and went over the green, couldn't get up and down. Then hit a couple bad drives coming in. I guess it is what it is.

 Q. Did you find a rhythm on your backside, back-9?
 SERGIO GARCIA: No, no, don't get me wrong. Like I said before, I just didn't feel it all day today. When I was 3-under for the day, I still wasn't comfortable. You know, I felt like I was fighting, I felt like I was fighting myself and, unfortunately, I wasn't good enough today so that's the way it is.

 Q. How was your experience coming back to Greensboro?
 SERGIO GARCIA: It was a good decent day of weather, you know. I wish I could have gotten a W but unfortunately I couldn't pull through.

 Q. Sergio, the playoffs now, you had a good run in the playoffs last year. A little more exciting in your veins, especially coming off a good performance here?
 SERGIO GARCIA: Well, I've still got to get better. Definitely there's room for improvement. But I still have to keep working on things and try to make sure that we keep heading in the right direction. We'll see where it goes.
