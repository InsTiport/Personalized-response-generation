 Q.   5‑under par, despite a double‑bogey at 17, how do you feel about your day?   How well did you play?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   Played nicely.   I feel like I played nicely all day.   Obviously all of the putts I made on the back nine, I missed on the front.   I had probably about three or four good chances on the front that I missed.   
But then I got going nicely on the back nine, and unfortunately just a combination of a little bit of a slip with the left foot on 17 and a bad swing, and it ended up being actually a pretty good double‑bogey.   So good thing is, we came back nicely with a birdie on the last, and you know, 5‑under is a good score.   
   
 Q.   Third time playing in this championship.   What do you think of this golf course?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, I'm not going to lie to you, it's not one of my favorites, that's for sure.   But it's always in good shape, so that makes it fun playing it, and we usually get great weather, so you know, it's a fun event.   
   
 Q.   We know you've been through your barren spell and come out the other side with two consecutive wins in Spain.   How different is your attitude now on the golf course, from, say, a year ago?   
SERGIO GARCIA:   To a year ago, it's probably changed a lot.   To probably the last seven or eight months, it has not changed much, no.   I tried to take it as easy as possible.   Obviously I wasn't happy with my shot on 17, but I tried not to get too caught up in the moment and don't let it affect me too much.   
So that's probably why I was able to make birdie on the next.   In the past, probably would have gotten really frustrated and then probably done something bad on 18, too.   You learn as you go, and hopefully we'll keep going like that.
