Q.
Is somebody going to beat Tiger on a Sunday in one of these some day?
SERGIO GARCIA:  Well, it doesn't look like it so far.  What can I say?  I mean, he definitely played extremely well.  Everything went his way, too.  The bad shots he hit all week long, he got away with them.  You know, that's about it.  When everything goes your way and you play well, you putt well, do everything well, it's going to be difficult to beat him.
Q.  When you're in a position like you're in, four shots back and if you get it to three early on, you know it's going to be him and you know you're probably going to have to 4  or 5 under to get in the middle of it?
SERGIO GARCIA:  I knew I had to shoot    I had 64 in my mind.  It's not very easy to do it out there, shoot 64 in a Sunday in a major where the wind was a bit tricky.  It wasn't a lot of wind but it was quite tricky.

You know, I actually felt like I was giving myself a chance of putting together a good solid round, but unfortunately I had a couple bad holes, and then you know, I hit a lot of good putts that didn't want to go in.  When that happens, you can only play for second, but it was close.
Q.  Do you take a lot of encouragement from your putting this week?
SERGIO GARCIA:  It was nice.  It can still get a lot better.  But I definitely felt pretty comfortable out there under the pressure and everything.  So it's been a good couple of last majors, happy about that.  To shoot 23 under par, in those two majors, it's not a bad thing.  Obviously it wasn't good enough, but it was    it felt pretty good.
Q.  Geoff Ogilvy said to us, he can't do this forever; I want to be there on a Sunday when he doesn't come in.
SERGIO GARCIA:  It will happen eventually.  It's going to happen.  I mean, he's not going to be 68 years old and in the final round of a major and tied for the lead and he wins.  It's going to happen eventually.  We'll see when.  (Laughter)
