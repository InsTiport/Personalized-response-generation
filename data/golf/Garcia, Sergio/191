Q.   Talk about the way that you closed with four birdies in the last five holes. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Well, if not for that, I would be heading home.

Q.   Have you ever done that before at Augusta, birdie four of the last five?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Have I ever done that?   Probably not.   Obviously, a bogey in the middle there.   I have had a good finish like that.   I think it was 2004 where I made eagle, birdie, birdie, birdie, par, par, or something like that.   But I'm not sure.   I think four birdies in the last five, probably not. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
SERGIO GARCIA:   I don't know.   I just got lucky, I guess.

Q.   Talk about 18, the birdie on the last hole. 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, 17 was big to make birdie there and give myself a little bit more breathing room going into 18. 
Then I hit a decent drive, just in the left rough.   And then I hit a really good shot from there.   I'm glad it came down the hill and gave me a nice easy putt for birdie.   So, we'll see what we're able to bring out on the weekend. 

Q.   Do you feel like you might not have made the cut, did that go through your mind?
SERGIO GARCIA:   Oh, for sure.   For sure.   Before that.   Before that.   Yeah.   After the bogey on 13, I felt ‑‑ I've seen this movie a lot of times here. 
So, it definitely didn't look like I might make it, but I managed to hit two or three good shots, couple nice putts, and I got fortunate to be here for the weekend.
