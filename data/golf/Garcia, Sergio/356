 Q.   Hard‑fought victory against Alvaro.   If you could just reflect on a good battle out there.   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, I guess you could say it was a good battle, because it was a battle.   That's about it pretty much.   I think the one that has the most credit today is the people that were following us for not walking off after 9 probably, because I can't really imagine that that was a lot of fun to watch.   We weren't playing very good.   
   
 Q.   It was a key point, key turning hole that you can reflect on where you thought you got it back?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I think that we are going to have a stretch‑‑ I had a stretch there on 10, 11, 12, where he did hit some good shots.   I made a big putt on 11 to stay 1‑down, and then he had a great chance on 12 from about probably five feet, no more than that, to go 2‑up.   If he would have made that, the way I was feeling, I would have struggled.   I think I would have struggled to get it back.   I had a lot of holes but it would have been difficult.   
You could see that he felt that, because after that hole, he struggled the next couple.   He kind of hit a couple bad drives and I managed to win both of them and got 1‑up.   And then I was fortunate enough to hit three really good iron shots coming in on 15, 16 and 17.   So that was about it.     
  
 Q.   A good win, how do you assess the match?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   It's hard to say, I really don't know how to take it.   I would like to say that the guy that played was the least‑‑ it wasn't a good match to watch.   I give credit to the people‑‑ if I was on the grounds, I would have walked in, simple as that.   
   
 Q.   As a golfing purist, I enjoy watching golf like that.   The turning point, if I may, the 11th, the par5, when you holed that putt?  
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I would probably say it was more the 12th.   I would say when he missed, because at some point in time, I was going to get lucky and I was going to make a putt.   But when he missed the putt on 12, he had me right there, and you know, obviously you could see he was a little bit deflated because of that.   And then I won the next two holes without really having to putt.   
I managed to hit three good iron shots coming in.   
   
 Q.   It's very, very difficult physically this week; will you go to the range or just go back to the room?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I will probably try to go to the range and hit a couple balls, not many.   I don't know, I seemed to hit it nicely on the range and then I go on the course and I struggle to hit good tee shots.   I don't know what's the deal with that.   But we'll try to hopefully find a way.   
   
 Q.   Your dad will be here to look at you?   
SERGIO GARCÃA:   He will be.   I don't know if he can fix me though.
