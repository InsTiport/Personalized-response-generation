Q.   Left knee?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, unfortunately same thing, same thing that happened on Sunday at the Spanish Open.   It felt better, I guess from resting it Monday and Tuesday.   Yesterday it felt okay.   But I think from walking on it and going down and up and up the hills and down the hills, it's just been pinching more than anything. 

Q.   Do you know what it is?
SERGIO GARCÃA:   I have an edema on the kneecap.   So I guess it just tightens up as I go. 

Q.   Is it just a case of resting it? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, I don't know, I'll go to the physio there in Spain and see what he says.   I'm sure I'm going to have to take some anti‑inflammatories.   I don't know, probably have to do a little bit of work on it I'm guessing, but we'll see.   But I don't know exactly. 
Yeah, I thought‑‑ and obviously it was a bit sore on Sunday, but you know, Tuesday‑‑

Q.   Did you go to the hospital on Monday? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Yeah, I had an MRI done on Monday morning.   Yeah, they checked it out and they said, yeah, it was obviously a small edema on the kneecap. 
But you know, it kind of felt better, Monday and Tuesday, and I don't know, I thought I was going to be able to, I was hoping I was going to be able to feel fine throughout the week.   But the way I felt more than anything on the last four holes and on 17, on 17 and 18, didn't feel good at all. 

Q.   No option there? 
SERGIO GARCÃA:   Well, the problem is, to play thinking about it and with the U.S. Open coming up, I'm not rested and stuff, I don't want it to get worse.
