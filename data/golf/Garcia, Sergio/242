 Q.   What is your verdict on the week?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   I guess a good week overall.   Some really good things, some not so good ones a couple of days, but you know, I just left myself a little bit too much work today to catch up.   But it was nice to play a good, solid round today with a little bit more wind and the course playing much longer.  
   
 Q.   Lovely score to finish with.   Were you thinking back to Qatar, coming from 11th place?  
SERGIO GARCIA:   No, here I was just way too far back.   I mean, I thought realistically, if I wanted to have a chance, I needed to shoot no more than 62 and it's not that easy to shoot that kind of score.   You know, I felt like I played nicely.   Finished with a good round, and that's the most important thing.
