 Q.   Sergio, every time I follow you, it's just another solid round of golf.   You could have gone lower today, but I thought 68 was a pretty solid day.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, you have to follow me more often then.   
We got fortunate with a little bit of rain yesterday, yesterday night.   The course wasn't playing easy.   It's a very challenging course.   It was a little bit windy.   So some of the tees were very tough.   If you didn't hit it perfect, you wouldn't hit those fairways, and it became a little bit of a struggle.   
I felt like I played okay.   I hit some good shots.   Probably didn't hit the ball as probably the shots felt, but two or three really good up and downs on the back nine.   So I'm happy with it so far.  
   
 Q.   So many big events now, just one right after another, and your game is in such a good spot right now.   You've got to feel that you're trending in the real positive direction.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, fortunately, I've been playing nicely all year.   So I'm excited about it.   
But we all know how golf is.   One day you have it, and the other day it's gone.   So hopefully, I'll be able to keep playing well and keep posting rounds like the one I had today.   If I manage to do that, I should have some chances of victories coming into the end of the season.  
   
 Q.   You seem like you're really enjoying yourself out there.   I mean, it's fun to follow you, but it looks like you're having fun.   
SERGIO GARCIA:   Yeah, it's good.   Obviously, we go through our up and downs, and we're going to enjoy the ups as much as possible because you don't have as many throughout your career.   You've got to enjoy those as much as you can.
