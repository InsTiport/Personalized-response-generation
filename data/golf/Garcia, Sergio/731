SERGIO GARCIA:  I didn't hit the driver very well on the back nine.  You know, I was hanging in there.  Making some good pars.  A couple birdies.  I made a big mistake on 16 and hooked it into the hazard, made bogey.  And then bad drive.  Just a little unlucky on 18, and I had a pretty difficult shot and it didn't work.  You know, double-bogey there.  You know, at least I played better than a couple days before.  I struck the ball better, and that's what happened.


Q.  What can you say about Tiger's performance today?

SERGIO GARCIA:  It was just unbelievable.  He was making birdie and birdie, and it was very good.


Q.  Were you almost looking around and seeing the ball?

SERGIO GARCIA:  I wanted to see how I was doing, because obviously I was 7-under and I wanted to see how far I was from him.  You know, it was real exciting.


Q.  Are you too far back to catch him?

SERGIO GARCIA:  Probably better.  It's maybe a little too much.  But I'll try.  I'll try to finish as good as I can.


Q.  Unrelated to today, how have you been spending your time?  Have you had any fun here?  I just heard you got your driver's license.  Are you out driving?

SERGIO GARCIA:  We went to see a movie yesterday.


Q.  You were trying desperately hard to get into that last group tomorrow, but at 17, what happened?

SERGIO GARCIA:  That was probably the key. That ball was in the hole.  7-under, I'm sure I hit a better driver or something else.  But, you know, it kind of put me a little down, and then double-bogey on 18.
