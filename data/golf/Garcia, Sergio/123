Q. Thoughts on that?
SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, it was a nice round.  Obviously it wasn't easy, a little shaky here and there at the beginning.  But back nine was great.  A lot of good shots, a lot of good putts.  You know, overall, I'm happy with my round.
Q. Pleased going into tomorrow's round?
SERGIO GARCIA: Definitely, for sure.  I have a chance of winning the OMEGA Dubai Desert Classic, which is a great tournament, a great event.  I'm going to give it my all tomorrow.
Q. How tough was it getting out there?
SERGIO GARCIA: At the end it was very, very dark, I'll tell you that.  I didn't think -- when we were walking on 17, I thought, well, it will probably be a little dark but not too bad.
But then it gets dark very, very quickly here.  Couldn't really see much on the last three shots.  Pretty much couldn't see the ball land and the last putt was a little bit of a feel and a little bit of the read that George gave me, and I'm very fortunate to be able to make it.
