  Q. Well played today, heartbreaking always to lose a playoff like, that but it was some fight between you and Pablo?  
 SERGIO GARCIA: Yeah, I think the playoff was awesome. We were hitting good shot after good shot. You know, I just wanted to make that putt so badly. Just hit it a little too hard. I don't know, I hit a great second putt. I mean, that ball has to go left, it has to. The putt coming up, it went a little right, and I don't know why it did it, but unfortunately lipped-out.   
 But you know, I felt like I played nicely. Just unfortunately got on a bad roll after the 11th, after the eagle there.   
 But you know, I think that the up-and-down on 17 and the birdie on 18 really meant a lot to get myself into the playoff. And then I think I played great on the playoff. I can't believe the putt on the third hole, I can't believe that putt didn't go in. It's one of those things.   
  
  Q. You got one goal achieved, at least, even if it's not a victory, you're in The Open at Royal St. George's in a couple of weeks?  
 SERGIO GARCÃA: Yeah, that's great. That's definitely one of the goals. We wanted to obviously get there and win the tournament if we could. Unfortunately Pablo was just a little bit better than us today.   
 After all when you look at it, I'm pretty satisfied. I think that I'm sure that we can learn some good things from this week, and we just can move forward.   
  
  Q. Are you still going to play Scotland, or are you going to look at your plans?   
 SERGIO GARCÃA: No. I'm not going to play Scotland.
