 Q.  On a day when the scoring has been pretty low, how nice to join the party at 67 and be nicely up there now in contention?  
 SERGIO GARCIA.   
 :  Yeah, well, we're going to be a little bit too far back, or farther back than we wanted.  It's a shame.  Today I played very well.  Today it could have been a really, really good day.  It could have been an 8- , 9-under par kind of day.  Unfortunately a couple lip-outs, a couple short misses and you know, unfortunate.   
 At least we stayed patient.  We came back nicely.  Played great on the back nine and you know, was able to shoot 5-under which is a great score.   
 Q.  So you played the back nine pretty well on all three days so far this week.  It seems to suit the game quite well.  
SERGIO GARCIA: It's just one of those things.  Today I should have been 4-under par on the front nine, easily, between like I said, a couple lip-outs and probably three putts inside six feet that I missed.   
So unfortunately it didn't want to happen but like I said, we stayed patient and finally a couple of them started dropping on the back nine and we were able to shoot a decent score.   
 Q.  You mentioned you might be a few shots back.  What will be the strategy going into tomorrow to try and chase that?  
SERGIO GARCIA: Nothing.  Just more of the same.  Try to play as well as possible.  Try to score as low as possible and see what happens.   
But you know, it's going to take a really, really low score because everybody is shooting good scores here.  This course, you know, this is not a Valderrama.  This course, it's allowing you to make lots of birdies and unfortunately even if you shoot 7-under, it's probably not good enough.
