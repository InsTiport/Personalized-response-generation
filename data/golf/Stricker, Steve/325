   STEVE STRICKER: I always enjoy coming here. The people, the tournament is run great. The people are great, and the food is awesome.   
  
  Q. I've known you for 20 years, I still don't know what kind of golf course favors your game. I would think it would be this style. Got a 68 today, and you've done quite well here in the past?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I enjoy the course. Yeah, I don't know what kind of course favors my game either. But I'd like to think I can play good anywhere. That's what I really think.   
 You know, I've been playing well this year, and I continued again today, and I look forward to doing it in the next few days.  
  
  Q. This golf course has changed a little bit over-the-air years. You never know what you're going to get here. It can be soft and squishy, and firm and fast. Do you like those conditions?   
 STEVE STRICKER: I love the firm and fast part. They try to get it firm and fast for us. And the last few years it has been. That's what I enjoy about it. The weather is usually warm, and the course drys out a little bit, and I enjoy that.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 STEVE STRICKER: You've still got to buckle down on each and every shot. And play smart and not try to get ahead of yourself. That's what I've been doing really well.
