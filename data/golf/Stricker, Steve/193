Q.   3‑under parch, pretty solid after last week, have you got a little rest now and kind of back into normalcy? 
STEVE STRICKER:   I didn't strike it too well today.   Felt really sluggish out there but you have days like, that whether you come off a win or not.   And I hung in there.   That's what I was proud of.   I just hung in there, I battled it out and I didn't hit it very well today but gutted it out and shot 3‑under to keep in the tournament. 

Q.   There's a fine line between the Top‑10 players in the world and the Top‑50 players in the world, and it's rounds like this that make you one of the top players in the world, that mental toughness that you have, just hang in there and you really battled the mental toughness last week with the struggles early in the last two rounds, and hung in there for good finishes; is that helping now going into this or is that just from old age and all that hard work?
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it's from experience I guess, and learning to stay in there and not give up and even though you don't have your best stuff, you just keep plugging away.   I was taught that at an early age and you know, it's stuck with me and it's important. 
You know, days like this, when you can salvage a round like you say, it means a lot because when you do have your best, you can move up because of this round today.   So it was‑‑ I was happy the way I hung in there.

Q.   I caught up with you on 16, the up‑and‑down on the last three holes, the lie on 17 it was close to the hole, it was a little dicey but the up‑and‑down on 16, 17, 18, could go a long ways to tomorrow if you shoot a low one. 
STEVE STRICKER:   No doubt.   And you never know what's going to happen.   12‑under is leaving now but they have to play that back side and it's tricky out there.   It's tough to get the ball in the fairway this year. 
The ball is really running away from you and I've hit a bunch of drives where you think you're going to be in the fairway and they end up in the rough in the first cut. 
So it's tough to get the ball in the fairway and you just never know what's going to happen.   A lot of guys up there are looking for their first win, and you just have to keep plugging. 

Q.   The whole thing, too, really, is not how many shots back but how many people are between you and that's really the huge thing right now. 
STEVE STRICKER:   I have not really looked at it but I saw I was 14th before making that birdie.   I'm sure there's eight or nine in front of me, and who knows by the end of the day but just got to keep hanging in there, keep doing the things that I did last week and hopefully hit it better tomorrow than what I did today.
