  Q. I think you had putts of 27, 28 and then 27 putts today.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I'm giving myself a lot of opportunities. I guess that's why I feel like I'm not making some, because I'm getting a lot of opportunities. Some are makeable, some are not. But I had a couple today that I -- I hit good putts at but didn't go in. So just trying to hold my head up, keep moving on and giving myself another chance.  
  
  Q. A lot of good memories last year come floating back to you I imagine in the final round on Monday.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I'm looking forward to tomorrow. You know, it's going to be a tough challenge. I think the weather is supposed to be perfect tomorrow, and I'm going to have to shoot something really low I imagine to catch the leaders. But it'll be fun to try, and we should have a good day.   
  
  Q. Are you cognizant of the streak that you're on?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I am. 72 holes?   
  
  Q. Going back to the final round at Barclays.   
 STEVE STRICKER: No kidding, yeah. I forgot about that round. I knew I was bogey-free here. I had forgotten about Barclays.  
  
  Q. Do you remember ever having a streak like this?  
 STEVE STRICKER: No, I never remember having a streak like that. I'd like to do one more day, though. I'd like to go the whole tournament without a bogey.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I mean, obviously when you win here and have had some other good finishes here, you know, you feel good coming back here. My game has been good. I'd like to be making a few more putts, but all in all, everything is going pretty well.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, it's hard to win out here on TOUR, no matter if you're old or young, veteran or not veteran, because the guys from behind are free-wheeling it. They can take some chances. And the guys up around the lead always play a little bit more conservative with the lead. It's always hard to win. You know, I'm just going to have to go out and do my best and try to get in position the last few holes and see if I can get a chance at it.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 STEVE STRICKER: I'll do the things I've been doing and see if I can't hole a few more putts.   
  
  Q. You're walking around with a permanent smile at the TPC Boston. What is it you like about this place?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I don't know, it's a great venue for a tournament. It's supported very well. The tournament runs it great, the tournament staff. I enjoy the course. It sets up well for me. It fits my eye, I guess. The greens are pure. There's a lot of good things here, and having won last year always helps, too. So it's nice to be playing well and having a chance going into tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You have had so much success in the Playoffs. How is your mental approach different in this stretch of tournaments let's say than it is for any other stretch of tournaments during the year?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I don't know, and I don't know if it is any different. I know the end of the season is near, and that excites me, spend more time at home. But we've got a lot of important golf left. Maybe I just concentrate a little bit harder or whatever, but it's always a good time of year to play well.
