  Q. Right now you're projected 5, so in that respect you did your job you feel like?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I played well all week. Today, you know, I bogeyed both those par-5s on the back, otherwise I'm right in there. If I birdied both of those, I'm four shots better. A little disappointing in that regard. But other than that, I played well all day again.  
  
  Q. On 11 you're coming off two birdies, that's the first par-5 you bogeyed. That was a back pin there?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, and I tried to chase a little wedge back there and it ran through the green. I chipped it up to a couple feet and missed that. I felt like I put a good stroke on that one, too. I've been doing much better putting. And then drove it in a bunker at 15, didn't have the stance really to even get it out of there, so kind of behind the 8-ball there.  
  
  Q. So a little mixed bag this week, or are you more happy than disappointed?  
 STEVE STRICKER: No, I'm more happy than disappointed. I hit it well. I thought my putting came around a little bit better. I worked on it a lot this week.   
 Yeah, if I can finish in the top 10 here and be in the top 5 going into the TOUR Championship, you know, it's a good thing.  
 Who is the other guy? Two guys are going to pass me.  
  
  Q. I'd have to look. Right now it just shows you No. 5.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Is there a couple of guys tied for the lead?   
  
  Q. Yeah, Casey and Dustin.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, sometimes in those projections they'll give 2500 to both leaders.  
  
  Q. So you might wind up 4.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Might. I know when you look on pgatour.com, they'll give 2500 to all the leaders, so four guys could be tied and you've lost four spots because of that. But if I can stay in the top 5, that would be good.  
  
  Q. How much are you looking forward to next week, just a week off? What are you going to do?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Nothing for a while. Actually I've got an outing up in Minneapolis on Tuesday that I've got to do, and tomorrow I'll go do something different.   
  
  Q. I think you're tied for 10th, which would be I believe your tenth top 10 in 15 playoff events?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Really?   
  
  Q. That's an incredible run. Any logical explanation for that, how well you've done?   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I don't know, except the fact that we go to venues that I like and I enjoy, and it's the end of the year, and I've built up a lot of confidence throughout these years. Other than that, I don't know. It's an exciting time. You want to play well. So there's a little more -- a little bit bigger tournament feel every week just because of what's on the line and at stake.  
  
  Q. And you like East Lake, too, don't you?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I do like East Lake. I had a chance to -- I think I finished 6th or something there last year. Tough course. Another course where pars are good, where you kind of have to play smart golf around there.
