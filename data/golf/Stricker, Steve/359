  Q.  Just real quick, he played six birdies on the front.  It was tough out there?   
 STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, it was tough, but I had a couple of opportunities that if I would have maybe made a couple of little putts I could have applied a little bit of pressure.  But he played well.  My hat's off to him.   
  
  Q.  Did you have fun this week?   
 STEVE STRICKER:  I did.  It was a great week.  I love this match play; I had a great two matches.  I just wish I could have done a little better today.
