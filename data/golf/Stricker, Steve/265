 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEVE STRICKER: I have learned a lot over the years but if you don't learn something every week or every day, something's wrong, I guess in this game. But again, I thought I handled everything very well. My nerves were under control. I played actually tee to green pretty good for two weeks in a row and I got really nothing out of my round with a putter. Today was a little bit better but it was disappointing that I didn't putt the way I normally putt. Because I could have really been right in there the way I hit the ball. 
 But it was a great fun tournament and it's a great venue for it too. The people I think really enjoy it, the players really enjoy it. I think it's a great place to have an event, except for that last hole.
 (Laughter.)

 Q. You had played this place once before the week before, do you wish you would have come up and learned a little bit more about it before now?
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, to some extent that's good thinking and other times it's good to come in a course where you don't know that much about it, you just see where you need to hit it and you focus, and your focus is there, instead of if you played it a bunch you get to know some spots where you don't want to be, if you know what I mean. 
 So it's not a bad thing. I played it enough. I knew where my lines were. I felt comfortable that there was plenty of room out there, but what I did find difficult here was just judging everything. Depth perception here is hard. I found that hard hitting little shots into 60- or 70- or 80-yard shots into some of these par-5s and even some of the shorter par-4s, sometimes it looked a lot closer than it actually was so I found that to be the most difficult thing here. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, they have a PGA back here in 2015. I'll be about 47, so hopefully I'm still playing by then. And yeah, it would be great to come back and play again in another major here. Like I say, it was pretty special week. The support that I got was unbelievable and it was tiring, you know, it takes a lot out of you, but all in all it was very fun. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEVE STRICKER: No doubt about it, yeah. It's really wide open. And it really -- that is all dependent on how you play those last four events and you need to be in the top-5 going into that last event to control your own destiny. So yeah, I feel like my game's good. If I can iron out this putter a little bit, I should be good to go. 
 So it's an exciting time of the year. We got a lot of big tournaments left, a lot of things riding for the last few events and especially the Ryder Cup the last one of the year, so looking forward to it all. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEVE STRICKER: I would love to play with him again. We talked about it earlier this year back in May. The reason it works, I think we get along with one another very well. I think we compliment each other's games nicely. Two different style games, but I think we putt well, we get it up-and-down well, and I think mostly we're comfortable with each other and I'm comfortable with him, which I think in years past some of his partners haven't been too comfortable playing with him and I am. So I'm hopefully looking forward to being paired with him again and it's going to be a tough trip, a tough match, but it should be exciting and fun. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEVE STRICKER: You can see from the leaderboard that you can call that right now, even if they don't win it. I mean I think just one guy up there whose got a major, Jim Furyk, Zach Johnson is up there too I think. And Elkington. Maybe there is more than I --
 (Laughter.) -- maybe there's more than one. But there's a lot of young guys and that's good to see. You need that for the game to grow and for interest to grow and those guys up there are great players, so any of them I'm sure can win. 

 Q. Any advice for the younger guys that are up there on the leaderboard?
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, I may be asking them for advice after they pull one of these off, but it's -- you know, they're just -- a lot of those players up there too hit it a long way. And that's a key to this game nowadays, you got to hit it a long ways. And I played with Rory McIlroy the first couple days and Adam Scott and they bomb it. And that's what you need to do. 
 This course is meant for length. Just look at the last hole, you got to hit it about 300 into the wind just to be able to get it home. So it's a game of length and all those guys up there hit it a long way and they're great players. 

 Q. Any moments or memories in particular that you'll take with you from the tournament?
 STEVE STRICKER: You know probably that standing ovation on the last, on 18 there walking up and feeling the support of everybody and knowing how much they care and same with me, you know. I'm proud to be from here and it was a blast this week, it really was. But I'm glad it's over too.
 (Laughter.)

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEVE STRICKER: I like the way it looks, to tell you the truth. It's young, but yet all the guys on that team are playing great. They're up there week in and week out, Kuchar, Dustin Johnson, Overton, yeah, he's not up there this week, but for the most part guys that are going to make that team have played some really solid golf all year long. So that's good. And it's -- I'm not sure who the captain's picks are going to be, but I'm sure they will be four good ones, everybody's made a strong push to try to make that team and guys have been responding and playing well. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I think that the team will be similar to last year, I would imagine. I'm not sure without looking at the list, but you need that young movement to be on that team and they will gain experience as they keep making these teams and the older guys have that experience and kind of can help those guys along and pretty soon those young guys are the old guys, you know, so it just keeps evolving. But it's fun to be with those young kids because they have no fear, they hit it a mile, and they go and find it. And it's a different type of game now and but it's fun to watch.
