  STEVE STRICKER:   I made a couple of nice putts on 16 and 17, so kind of stole a couple there.   But you hate to give them back.   Any time you go around and shoot a couple under in a major; it didn't hurt me, but I would like to make birdie there.   
   
 Q.   Been a great week for you so far, and obviously the announcement being one of Tom Watson's vice captains at Gleneagles, talk about how much of an honor that is?  
STEVE STRICKER:   It is, it's a great honor for me.   Doesn't look like I'll be a playing member but to be part of it is pretty special, and to get the call from Tom to be asked to be part of it was a thrill.  
I was on that losing team in 2012 at Medinah, and so hopefully in some little way I can help out and we can get that Cup back.   
   
 Q.   As a current player and your relationship with the players on that team, how important will that be?   
STEVE STRICKER:   I think that's kind of why they had me.   I know all the guys on the team.   I play out here on a regular basis and I've played on multiple teams with these guys and other players.   So I think that's kind of why they wanted me to be a part of it, so I could maybe get some insider scoop that maybe they can't.   But I think the guys, Raymond and Andy North, it's just a great thrill for me to be a part of all that.   
   
 Q.   Final question, how do you see the situation right now with Tiger Woods trying to make the team?   
STEVE STRICKER:   We need him on that team.   We need a healthy Tiger on the team, and I don't really know how I played today.   I know he was over par, but I don't know how well he hit it.   He's got a lot of time to get ready and Tom wants him to be a part of the team and I know Tiger wants to be a part of that team.   So we can definitely use him with guys getting hurt and taking time away from the TOUR like Dustin Johnson, so we can definitely use him.   We just have to wait and see how he feels.   
   
 Q.   2‑under par 69, I know 18 you didn't want to bogey, but you have to feel good about your round after today.   
STEVE STRICKER:   It was a good round.   I did a lot of good things, and a couple dumb mistakes.   To drive it in the water on 18, you can't do that.   You have to put over that bunker if anything.   I tried to get aggressive and came off it and didn't hit it solid and hit it in the water.   I would have liked to have that shot over for sure.  
   
 Q.   You were announced as a vice captain for The Ryder Cup Team.   Were you trying to show Tom you could still play?   
STEVE STRICKER:   All these guys are dropping like flies on our team and it's a little bit scary.   Kuch I see withdrew this morning and Dustin Johnson as we know is out and Tiger is not feeling very good; Dufner and his neck, it doesn't bode well for us so far.   But there's a lot of good players still and guys are still jockeying for position and trying to make that team.  
Shoot, I've still got a chance.   I could win or finish second and get right in there yet, so that's what I'm thinking about.  
   
 Q.   You look like you're absolutely fit.   You've had some time off; what have you been doing at home?   
STEVE STRICKER:   A lot.   These kids have me hopping and they are coming with me all the time.   I'm watching what I eat.   I'm not working out so much but just watching what I'm eating, and busy.   I'm staying busy, and days are flying by and years are flying by it seems like.   
But I keep busy and still play a fair amount of golf when I'm home and enjoy coming out here when I do.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday you said you thought you would be able to get it around and looks like you did that pretty good today.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I did a lot of good things.   I made some nice putts at 16 and 17 to get to 3‑under.   I wish I had that tee ball over on 18 but all in all a good start.   Did a lot of good things and hit the ball really solidly on 18.   
   
 Q.   Playing alongside Tom, obviously he played pretty good.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, one bogey.   
   
 Q.   Are you guys concerned, did you talk about‑‑ I know you're into your own games, but guys dropping like flies, a couple withdrawals today?  
STEVE STRICKER:   We didn't talk about it much but I did mention the fact that Kuchar withdrew, and I said the same thing, these guys dropping like flies.   He said, well, you'd better get your clubs ready.   
I'd have to finish first or second here to maybe sneak into one of those spots but that's not really what I'm thinking about.   I'm just trying to take each day as it comes and try to get through it.  
   
 Q.   Are you optimistic about finishing strong and having a good finish?   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I am.   I thought I did a lot of good things today.
