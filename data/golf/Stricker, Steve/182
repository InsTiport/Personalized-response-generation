Q.     How comfortable was it out there? 
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it was a long day, and dealing with all sorts of different conditions and changing conditions throughout the day, that wears on you mentally, too, while you're out there.   But yeah, I don't know how long it ended up taking us today to play, but glad I'm finished.   We probably got the better end of the deal in this, even though we played in some rain.   The guys who are going off this afternoon are going to have to deal with playing in this wind, and it's‑‑ we played the last seven or eight holes in that wind, and it was all over the place.   It's tough to pick a club. 
The temperatures even dropped a little bit, and it's going to be tough for them out there.

Q.   Seemed like you adjusted well, though, with the way you finished. 
STEVE STRICKER:   Well, I made some putts coming in.   Something I haven't been doing for a while, but I made three nice putts coming in and got myself right back in there.   I don't think anybody is really going to run away with it today.   I hung in there and made three good birdies to finish the round. 

Q.   Did you capture a little bit of that magic you had last year?
STEVE STRICKER:   No, it was a struggle the first two days.   I played the first two days like I normally play here, to tell you the truth.   Last year was a little bit‑‑ a little out of the norm.   I don't know what happened last year.   But this was more like the way I usually play at Muirfield the last couple of days.

Q.   When you have a two‑hour rain delay what do you do?
STEVE STRICKER:   Same thing.   We just hung out.   I didn't eat anything this time.   But you just hang out, call home, check on everything at home and play on your phone and just take it easy, I guess, and just wait it out.

Q.   When you pack for here, is it pretty much in the back of your mind that this is going to happen?
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.   You pack for colder weather and some rain, even though I was looking at the forecast all week, and they were calling this for quite a while.   Ten days ago they were calling for this Thursday or Friday kind of rain.   Yeah, you just never know, and you've got to pack for it all. 

Q.   Would you rather have the rain and get it out of the way on Friday and hope that the weekend is nice? 
STEVE STRICKER:   You know, it doesn't matter.   Everybody has got to play in it today, and like I said, I think we got the better end of the deal because they're going to have to deal with the wind today, this afternoon. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, and it's cooled off, too.   The wind switched on us a couple times out there where we thought it was coming out of one direction, it's coming out of another, and then it switched for good, too, at times, too.   It made club selection a little bit tough at times.

Q.   Any issue out there today with the cell phone cameras?
STEVE STRICKER:   I didn't, no, nothing at all.   I'm old and wrinkly.
