  Q. Steve another good ball striking round for you 15 of 18 greens.  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah. It was good and bad at times. Hit a couple squirrely shots, saved a couple that I needed to save to continue the round, and chipped in at 17 to kind of end the day. That was a good way to finish.  
  
  Q. Had 28 putts in each of the first three rounds.  
 STEVE STRICKER: Really? Consistency, I guess. I made a lot of good ones today, all in all a good round. I got a shot going into tomorrow.  
  
  Q. You come down here out of Madison not really knowing what the shape your game in because still cool weather, still golf courses not open in Wisconsin. Got a pretty good idea of how you're playing now?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I'd like to be a little more consistent, more of a consistent feel. The feel part for me is a little -- one of the things that varies for me, and I'd like to get that under control a little bit more. But all in all, I'm hanging in there. I'm stepping up and hitting some good shots when I have to and making some putts.  
  
  Q. I imagine the Shell Houston Open has a fond place in your heart. This is the tournament that gave you an invite when your game was in a little bit of a slump back in 2006. You took advantage of that and haven't been stopped since.  
 STEVE STRICKER: No doubt, yeah. Houston Golf Association, Steve Timms and his group are, like you say, they got a special place in my heart and I always enjoy coming here. Great people, treat you well, run a great tournament.   
 The course is in great shape. The whole community gets behind it, as you can see with the number of people that are out today. So it's always nice to come here.
