   STEVE STRICKER: (Inaudible) Martin Laird's at 12, he's got a birdie putt at 14. Kuch just birdied to go to 11, and he's going to 17. So probably couple short.  
  
  Q. Do you feel you had to get in --  
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, you know I thought if I got it to 11, I might have a chance. That's why I thought that putt, I honestly thought I needed to make that.  
  
  Q. Steve, how about your play today in general?  
 STEVE STRICKER: It was very solid. No bogeys today. A little tougher today, too. The greens got considerably firmer, faster, probably a couple two or three faster than what we played the first three days.   
 It was a different course. A little more run-out in the fairways. It dried up quite a bit in a short period of time.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible)?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, for sure. Big momentum. I mean, it's a good start. I don't know where I'm going to end up in all this, but obviously a good start to the playoffs.   
 And going next week to defend at TPC at Boston. So obviously I've got good feelings going in there and excited to get going there next week.
