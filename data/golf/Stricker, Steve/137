 Q.   You configured your schedule based on family time.   Does this sort of justify the way that you've planned things out?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it does.   I really didn't know what to expect coming into this week.   Last time played was PLAYERS Championship a month ago, so I really didn't know what to expect.   I've been playing well at home, been hitting it well at home, but that's home, it's not out here.   
But I just figured that I'm in a good place mentally, I feel like I'm doing the right thing by not playing.   I'm enjoying my time at home, so it all makes sense in my mind and I guess that's the most important thing.   And I'm happy the way I'm striking it.   
Couple loose shots today that I'm not so happy with, but overall it just justifies what I'm doing and especially when I play well.   
   
 Q.   Is your family here?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   So what's it like to have to be working Father's Day for somebody who really cares about family?  
STEVE STRICKER:   They're loving it.   Believe me, they're loving every minute of it.   They're up ‑‑ we've also got a friend with us here too.   So the girls are all up until 11:30, it seems like, every night.   No curfew here.   And frozen yogurt at night.   And they're loving life.  
   
 Q.   At this point in your career, what value do you place on a Major?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Well, it would mean a lot.   It really would.   But it's going to be a challenge tomorrow.   I'm not the longest hitter in the field.   There's some holes out here that I have to really work hard to make pars on.   
And I'm even laying back.   Like on 14, I hit 3‑wood today just because it doesn't fit my Iowa [ck] driver very well and there's a utility club in there and I hit utility club into 17 and probably would have been utility club into 18 if I was in the fairway.   
So it's a long course for me.   It's the longest short course I've heard of.   They're saying how short it is, but I feel like it's‑‑ there's some really long holes for me out here.   But I've been playing them well.   
But the Major, the win would be‑‑ it would be unbelievable.   But I'm out not trying to think about that yet.   I'm just trying to execute the shots that I know how to do and take one shot at a time and go from there.  
   
 Q.   Just interested in how you're enjoying your new image as a AVIS commercial savage.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I hear that quite a bit out in the gallery now.   And I'm not a savage by any means, I guess that's the funny part of the commercial.   
But yeah, it's, I felt like a dork making it, but it was all good, all in good fun.  
   
 Q.   What's it going to take for you to win the U.S. Open?  
STEVE STRICKER:   I've got to play smart golf.   I got to not make any mistakes.   I think that's the biggest thing.   And it's a course where it's tough to come back from.   There's a lot of good holes, especially coming in at the last five holes.   So you have to play smart, you've got to take advantage of some of those shorter holes and give yourself some opportunities.   You got putt well.   And there were times today where I felt like I didn't putt very well and then I did putt well.   And so I got to get a little more consistent with that, I think, and just try to not make too many mistakes tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   How much do you think fatigue has set in when you're trying to catch up to complete your first round, trying to complete your second round, look like some of the guys are starting to wear on them a little bit?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I think mentally too it wears on you, as well as physically.   But I've been fortunate, I finished yesterday, so I was able to get a good night's rest today or this morning, I was able to sleep in.   It would have been a different story if I would have had to come back out here early this morning.   
So I feel like I'm pretty well caught up and I'll get another good night's sleep tonight and a late tee time tomorrow.   So I don't feel like that should be an issue.   
   
 Q.   How important was that putt on 18?  
STEVE STRICKER:   That was a big putt.   I wanted to make that.   I wanted to be at even par.   I thought maybe the lead could be 2‑under, so I didn't want to get, lose another shot and be three back potentially.   And as it turns out, I'm only one back.   So that was a big putt.   Keeps my momentum going for tomorrow and keeps me closer.   
   
 Q.   Playing less, spending more time with the family, and maybe putting priorities elsewhere, does that in a way take pressure off you especially in situations like this in a Major Championship?  
STEVE STRICKER:   No doubt about it.   That's what I said coming in here.   I really wasn't all that nervous today.   I was excited, I was happy to be in the position I was in.   But, yeah, I didn't really know what to expect coming into here.   I've been playing well and I've had a good year so far.   I've been in contention in a lot of tournaments.   So I've got confidence, guess I should say.   But I just still didn't know how I was going to play.   I'm pleasantly surprised and happy that I'm playing well and it shows that I can do this.   That I can take this time off and still be competitive.
