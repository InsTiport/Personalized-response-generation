Q. An opportunity for the U.S. Team to make history.  Didn't quite turn out that way but an amazing day for a great team?
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, another great day.  Again these guys have played unbelievable golf.  It wasn't a good start for us this afternoon, either, and these guys just, you know, they get in that position where they are down and they keep fighting and scratching.  They hit some great shots coming down the end.  They made some clutch putts.  A long day but another good one.
Q. Conditions weren't exactly easy.  It was tough out there this afternoon?
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, and it got colder as the day went on.  These guys are tired, you know, but they played well.  We'll get out of here, get some good rest and look forward to tomorrow.
