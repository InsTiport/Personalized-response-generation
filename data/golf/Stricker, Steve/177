  STEVE STRICKER:   You got to make the cut to be able to try to win the tournament.   That's always my first goal, believe it or not, in tournaments:   Make sure you're playing on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Talk about today's round.   Another good one for you.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, you know, it was pretty good.   Had a little hiccup right out of the chute on No. 11, my second hole of the day.   Drove it down there with a wedge in my hand and missed the green.   
I've done that two days in a row off this lie, same lie both days in row.   Missed the green to the right and didn't get it up and down.   Missed a five‑footer.   Kind of wasn't the start I was looking for.   I was hoping to get a birdie before I got a bogey ‑‑ or no bogeys at all.   
But I hung in there.   I was patient and hit some good shots.   Made a nice long putt at 13 and birdied 14, so I righted the ship pretty quickly and got her going in the right direction.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you've put yourself in position for the weekend?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, very much so.   I think right now leading is 13, so I'm three back; yesterday I was 4 back.   If that stays the case, I actually picked you up a shot on the lead.  
And there is a long ways to go.   That's the other thing.   There is a lot of good players and a long ways to go, so I just have to keep doing my thing.   
I need a low round.   That's what it's going to take.   One of these two rounds on Saturday or Sunday I'm going to have to put up a real low one and get right in there.
