Q.   Steve, great playing out there once again.   Maybe not all that you hoped for.   Boy, you know how to hang around.
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.   I had some opportunities again today.   I hit a lot good putts, too, over the edges.   Starting to get a little frustrating at times but hung in there and made a couple birdies on 15 and 18, keep hanging around looks like I may be four back by the end of the day.   I got an opportunity to tomorrow.

Q.   Which is more important, the number of shots you are behind or the number of people between you and the top of the leaderboard?
STEVE STRICKER:   The number of people in between the leader and myself.   There's not that many.   It's going to be tough tomorrow.   This is a course where there's some trouble out there and if you're playing around the lead or in the lead, you know, sometimes you're going to play a little more cautious.

Q.   I know you would never say this, I'll say it:   There's not a lot of veteran experience on this leaderboard, either.   You have to like that a little bit.
STEVE STRICKER:   Ernie is up there, John Rollins is up there.   You know, Dufner is playing great.   He hasn't won yet.   He's going to be fighting some nerves coming down the stretch tomorrow and so will I.   It's a nerve-wracking situation but that's part of the fun, too.   That's why we put ourselves in this position.
