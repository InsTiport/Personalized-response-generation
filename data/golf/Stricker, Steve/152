 Q.   As good a putter as you are, it looked to me like that putt you just holed surprised you a little bit?  
STEVEN STRICKER:   Yeah, it was a tough putt.   It was downhill, downgrain, and he had five or six feet left, and I was just making sure I wasn't going to give myself the same comeback or so.   I wanted to make sure I had good speed, but I had a pretty good feel for the line.   It was kind of in a trough.   I had two little mounds on each side there that I felt like I could go in between.   But you don't expect to make a putt like that.   
We both played great, and that's match play.   He didn't make a bogey today and neither did I, and neither one of us really deserve to go home.   But I'm very excited to be moving on.  
   
 Q.   You've got Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals.   What do you think about that match?  
STEVEN STRICKER:   It's going to be tough.   He's a good match play player.   Yeah, that's all I can say.   But I'm playing well.   I like what I'm doing.   I like how I'm hitting it.   I'm making a lot of putts.   I can't give him any holes.   That's the key to this match play, I think, is just stay in every hole and make the other guy beat you.
