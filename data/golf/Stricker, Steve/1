  Q. How did you feel this week?
 STEVE STRICKER:   Obviously when you can have a couple of days of practice, get here a few days ahead of time, it all helps.  But that's no excuse that I missed the cut last week.  I actually got off to a great start and then just kind of ran out of that momentum on Friday last week, and ended up missing the cut.  Yeah, I had a great opportunity.  I got off to a good start last week and then just didn't capitalize on it.
 Q. Today you shot one of the best rounds out there in the afternoon wave.  Especially in these conditions, how good was that round?
 STEVE STRICKER:   I played well.  I struck it nicely, hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens, gave myself a lot of opportunities.  I left a couple out there.  I stole one on 17, got it up-and-down on 17.  But yeah, stuff that you have to do on days like today when it's blustery, and the wind would lay down at times and then really blow.  You had to really pay attention, and club choice was difficult.  I managed my way around there pretty well today.
 Q. Speaking of momentum, last week you struggled with that momentum.  How do you change that this week going into Friday?
 STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I've got to be ready tomorrow, and hopefully do the same thing I did today.  Just keep that nice rhythm going.  Like I said, I hit a lot of fairways, gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Hopefully I can make a few more putts tomorrow and give myself a little bit of a chance over the weekend.
 Q. Anything in particular that you're seeing?
 STEVE STRICKER:   You know, all of it was pretty good.  I made some putts that I probably shouldn't have and I missed some that I probably should have made.  Those kind of evened out.  But like I said, I played really solid from tee to green.
