 Q.   If I could just get a comment, obviously, depending on how you look at it, good news, bad news.   Just some comments on everything today.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, you know, it's‑‑ I think we got the better end of the deal by not even playing in it.   It looked like it was pretty tough conditions for everybody, and cold weather and rain.   I didn't have to really go out and get started in it and come back in, all that stuff.   So that was good, I guess, in that respect.   But I wish we could have got it in.   I wish we could have played for all the fans that are here and the sponsors and everything.   Yeah, got to go back at it again tomorrow and try to put up a good round.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned you didn't have to really get too much of a game face on.   Do you go through a decompression now with the final round Sunday, or how does your mindset work?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it'll be back it again tomorrow.   You just take it like it's Sunday tomorrow, and today was kind of an off day.   I got to hang out and do some different things with Nicki and the kids were here still, so kind of hung out with them, so it didn't really ever feel like I was going to get out there and play today.   The weather just looked bad all the way around.   But I'll be ready tomorrow.   Early start tomorrow, and the weather looks better, so it should be good.
