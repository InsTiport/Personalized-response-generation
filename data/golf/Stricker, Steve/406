Q.
Talk about today's round.  Obviously a big round.
STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, it was a good day.  I played well.  I played well all 18 holes.  I had a lot of birdie opportunities.  I hit a lot of greens.

I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  I need to put probably another one up tomorrow to even have a chance, but at least I have a chance going into tomorrow.
Q.  Bogey-free round, seven birdies.  Couldn't have asked for a better performance today.
STEVE STRICKER:  Not really.  As I said, I had a lot of opportunities.  I made some putts today which I didn't make the last couple days, so I took advantage of some good shots and got away with a couple of bad ones.  It was a good solid day and put me in contention for tomorrow.
Q.  I know that you're fighting for your card to be in the top 125 on the Money List.  How wonderful is this tournament for you to keep your Tour card this year?
STEVE STRICKER:  Well, I don't know.  It all depends what those leaders do the rest of the day.  I'm sure they've still got about six holes to play.  Hopefully I can just put one more good solid round together.  You know, another round like I did today, we'll see what happens.

I need a good tournament.  What a better place to do it for me, you know, right close to home.

I can hopefully go out and get another good one tomorrow.
Q.  How much does it help you, you've obviously been to winner's circle a few times, having that experience, having been there?
STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, it helps.  It's been a while, so I still -- you know, it's not like I'm Vijay who's won three times this year, somebody like that, but, you know, it's helped.  I know that I can do it, you know, but again, I've been fighting some problems that I've had in my game, and we'll see tomorrow.  It's a good test for me tomorrow.
Q.  Do you almost have to almost keep yourself a little under control?  It's been a grind for you this year because you really haven't been this close?
STEVE STRICKER:  Right, and I'm trying to downplay it.  I'm coming in trying to make aggressive swings and I've tried not to think about what position I was in and tried to make some birdies.

I'm going to have to have that same mind set tomorrow because there's a lot of birdie opportunities out here and a lot of guys are going low, so you're going to have to make a lot of birdies.
