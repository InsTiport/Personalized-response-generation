STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I didn't make a putt in four days, struggled mightily on the greens.  Very difficult to hole a putt.  I had a really hard time.  I don't know why, optically they didn't do what I was thinking they were going to do.  My speed was off.  But other than that I had a great time coming over again.  But it's hard to compete and shoot some good scores when you're not holing any putts.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it's been busy but good.  I'm excited to play.  My game is in good shape.  So it was good to come over.  Always a treat to play in an Open and the weather was great on the weekend, which made it pretty enjoyable and a lot of fun to play.  So it's been a busy summer but a good busy.  I've got a lot of irons in the fire.  I'd rather have it that way than doing nothing at all.  So it's been good and exciting.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: And probably play in the playoffs, the FedExCup playoffs, I should be eligible for the first one, at least, and do that and start making plans for that team, The Presidents Cup team in September.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: It's something I'm proud of.  Making that many in a row is something that I look fondly upon.  I wish I would have won one in there somewhere.  But it's a neat accomplishment.  But I guess it shows my longevity and that I'm continuing making these cuts still at 50.  So that's the good part, I guess.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: As a player?  Oh, yeah, I think just making sure that the guys are all on the same page.  They know what's coming.  We'll have a get-together coming up here soon and we'll probably have a practice round at Liberty National before the playoffs start.
So it's just about making sure the guys are comfortable with me, with the rest of the guys that are on the team, potentially, and then they know the game plan moving forward.  Some of these guys could be on the team that have never played on a team.  So that will be a new experience for them.  So to make sure that you hold their hand a little bit more, maybe, and make sure you answer all their questions and they know what's to be expected.  But it's just making a good environment so they feel comfortable, and hopefully bring out their best golf.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, and they're young guys.  Guys that could be around for a long time.  So that I think is exciting.  They're fierce competitors.  They've got a little edge to them.  They don't seem to back down, some of these guys.  So that's good things to have on your team.  So to get them in a team environment early on in their careers is a good thing, as we look to future years.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: You know, I'm sticking to my schedule pretty much.  I'm going to play -- I may play a Champions Tour event in a couple of weeks before the PGA, and then play the PGA, and then whatever holds for me in the playoffs.  So I don't have that many events left, but I'll continue to play.  But, yeah, it's exciting the way I'm hitting it.  I just got nothing out of my rounds any of these days except maybe for the second round.  It's exciting the way I'm hitting it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: It's one hole after another that can come up and get you.  So it's very challenging.  It all depends on the kind of weather that you have during the week.  But a very tough and demanding course.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: Well, I shot a 64, I think, in the third round, I think, that got me in that final grouping.  And then just didn't hole some of the putts early on.  I hit a couple of good shots early on, if I remember right, and didn't hole some key putts, and just kind of felt out of place and never got rolling.
Q. (Inaudible.)
STEVE STRICKER: I thought it played great.  I thought it was very fair.  You can see that the leaders aren't going to go very crazy today.  The pins are in difficult positions, on the edges of little knobs and side hills.  There are some tricky pins out there today.  So it's going to take a very committed round of golf, I think, to play well.  You can't be flag hunting today.  You're going to have to play some smart shots into the greens.
