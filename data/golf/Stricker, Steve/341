 Q. What happened out there? 
 STEVE STRICKER: You know, I got off to a good start. I was through ten holes and I was 1-under, and doing okay and then I made two stupid plays in a row at 11 and 12. Really the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays I ever made trying to do what I did out of the rough there, and from that point on, it was a struggle to get in. 

 Q. How do you get that out of your mind going into tomorrow; you're not that far off the lead. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, four back, not a good day today. It wasn't what I was looking for. I got off to a start, like I said, but then just stunk it up. 
 I've got to try to regroup, try to come back tomorrow and see if I can't put a good, low one up on the board. It's tough, too, it got a little crusty. The wind picked up a little bit. But I didn't do very well today. 

 Q. Better tomorrow?
 STEVE STRICKER: I hope so.
