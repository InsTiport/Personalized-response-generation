 Q. 6-under par through three rounds of the tournament, how would you assess today's round? 
 STEVE STRICKER: You know, it's pretty solid. I hit a lot of good shots. I drove the ball great again. Kind of struggled with my irons coming in, hitting them close enough. I don't know, just didn't hit very aggressive shots in there which is a little disappointing not giving myself some birdie opportunities coming in. Still a good round, bogey-free today and that's always a good thing. 

 Q. You had some birdies out there, tell us about the learning curve on these greens, reading these greens. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, they are in good shape. They are a little wet but they roll the ball well. 
 The ball is rolling on there well. You know, there's a lot of tricky spots. If you get on the wrong side, you're playing a little defensively at times. And it's tough to learn all of the spots because it's our first time around here, so we are learning as we go. So it's difficult at times and maybe that's why I'm a little more cautious at times, too, firing shots into the greens because I'm quite not sure what to expect up around the greens. 

 Q. Boggy-free given the conditions early on, would you guess this would be what would happen?
 STEVE STRICKER: Not really. You never know what's going to happen out there. But I've been hitting the ball well. I've been driving the ball well. Not hitting my irons particularly close but you know, keeping it in play for the most part and staying away from any big numbers last couple of days. 
 I'm in good shape. Hopefully I'll stay within three shots going into tomorrow and we'll see what happens tomorrow. 

 Q. Contrast the conditions to what you've seen the first few days. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Oh, I played yesterday afternoon and it was just as soft then as it was today. 
 It was nice that we were able to put the ball in our hands and wipe the mud off and try to find some dry spots. I took casual water relief probably three or four teams out there today. 
 So the course, the fairways are very saturated but we dodged most of the weather and we got the day in which is always good, and hopefully it will dry out a little bit overnight for us tomorrow. 

 Q. Were you a little disappointed that you went bogey-free and couldn't have got a couple more birdies along the way?
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, especially I had 14, the short little par 3, you've got a 9-iron in your hand and a sand wedge in your hand at 16 and a 9-iron in my hand at 17 and not giving myself very good looks at it which is disappointing. Kind of flinching off the fairways a little bit, they are so wet you have to make sure that you're not going to hit a bad shot or anything like that. So hopefully put some better swings on it tomorrow. 

 Q. Does your game plan change tomorrow?
 STEVE STRICKER: It doesn't change. I imagine if the sun is out and things dry up a little bit, it all depends on the wind. If this course has some wind it can be pretty tough. If the wind is down, scoring is going to be good I think because the conditions are soft.
