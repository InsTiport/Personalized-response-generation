 Q.   Certainly nothing is easy about playing out there, but comfortable win, I would imagine, for you?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, Henrik didn't play his best, and I played steady.   I didn't make really too many mistakes, didn't make a lot of birdies either, but just didn't make too many mistakes.   Yeah, happy to move on and look forward to tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Your back, everything is good?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, everything is good.  
   
 Q.   Looking forward to tomorrow, just playing kind of the same attitude, I would imagine?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.   You know, I play Nick Watney tomorrow, so it's going to be tough.   He's a good player, and he's playing well.   I'm going to have to play a touch better tomorrow than I did today probably.   
   
 Q.   How crazy was the last 24 hours?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, really crazy.   You know, the snow, wake up and still snow on the ground, snow on your car, coming to the golf course and there's snow on your car, there's not too many tournaments I've done that in.  
   
 Q.   Were you getting calls from home bragging how warm it was?  
STEVE STRICKER:   They said it might have been nicer there yesterday.   We could have played there.
