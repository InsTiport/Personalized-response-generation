  Q. Talk about playing against Adam and K.J., you have a good history together, going back to a couple of Presidents Cups and Ryder Cups, I mentioned to Tiger it might have something to do with the fact that 2007, you played in practically every round together in the FedExCup. What do you think the secret has been to you playing together?   
 STEVE STRICKER: I think we are just comfortable with one another. We enjoy going out with one another. Our styles of games I think are different, but, you know, the same, I guess. He obviously hits it a lot further than I do. But we both plot our way around the golf course pretty much the same and are good putters.  
 Going against Adam here in Australia, and K.J. Choi, a good player, it's going to be a tough match.   
  
  Q. Do you think that kind of all the anticipation of Tiger and Adam playing together, is that just kind of -- was too much made of that, otherwise the captains probably wouldn't have put them together?  
 STEVE STRICKER: You know, from what I understood, that's kind of the way it played out. It wasn't intentional to get the two together, but I'm kind of glad that it's going to happen, get it out of the way, and you know, let the rest of the matches take care of themselves so to speak.   
 Yeah, I think it will be good to like I say, just get that part of it out of the way, and Stevie and Tiger have talked, so I think it's kind of a non-issue. But like I say, it will be good to get it out of the way.
