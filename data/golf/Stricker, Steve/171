 Q.   Your caddie said yesterday was just as good as today in the way you hit it.   What was the difference?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Well, I got it a little closer today in some spots and made a couple of putts, left a couple of putts out there, too, but yesterday was a real solid day.   You just had to kind of grind it out yesterday.   73 yesterday was probably like a 3‑, 4‑under round.   It was a good round to get under my belt yesterday because I didn't play particularly well on the first day shooting a couple over in somewhat windier conditions in the morning.   Two good rounds, so hopefully I can put one more together tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   What did today's round mean?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Well, you know, it kind of gets me back in it.   It all depends on what happens this afternoon.   The wind may be kicking up a little bit more, making it a little bit more difficult for them.   But it all depends what those leaders do.   If one of those leaders goes out and shoots a 5‑under round, bang, I'm seven back again.   It all depends what they do will determine how far I'm back, obviously.   
I'm going to have to have another good one or better one tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   How much does it help what you did on 18 just mentally going into a nice sleep and then tomorrow?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, that was a good finish.   I missed a short little putt at 13.
