  STEVE STRICKER:   I played pretty cautiously all the way around the last two days.   I got a new set of irons in the bag.   I'm trying out with different Shafts.   So, it's kind of a little wait and see.   I don't know what state my game is in while I'm out there.   I played pretty cautiously.   Played pretty well.   I picked my spots and putted fairly well.   Missed a couple here and there, but overall it was a good two days.

Q.   The golf course wasn't playing that easy before.
STEVE STRICKER:   No, it wasn't.   We have a north wind today.   Usually it's out of the south.   16, 17, 18, played pretty tough, and, you know, there's holes that can jump up and get you at anytime out there.   You really have to be careful.

Q.   Your game plan for the weekend?
STEVE STRICKER:   Just keep doing the same thing, kind of keep plugging along, doing my thing and, you know, trying to ease back into it and hopefully play well this weekend and get ready for next.
