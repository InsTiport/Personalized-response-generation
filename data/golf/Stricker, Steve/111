Q.   Just talk about how great the competition was. 
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, we realize that, too.   You need to make birdies to win a hole or to tie a hole, so your mindâ€‘set is such that you've got to be aggressive.   Just a couple few birdies we didn't make, and that was the difference in the match.

Q.   Did the rain delay affect anything? 
STEVE STRICKER:   No, I don't think so.   We came back out and we were all even coming out and we tied 15.   Graham hit a great shot in there at 16, the par 3 and that was the difference.

Q.   Talk about Jordan and his performance so far. 
STEVE STRICKER:   It was a lot of fun.   We did well together.   We had a lot of fun, played well together, and you know, he'll have time to rest and get ready for tomorrow.   So that's always good, too.   A lot of golf and a lot to take in for your first time.
