  STEVE STRICKER:   It was a fun round of golf to watch Jason play.   He played flawlessly really all day.   It started right away when he holed out on No. 2 for eagle.   And from there he made a bunch of birdies, bunch of long putts, hit some in there real tight and made those putts.   
Made a great save, I think, at No. 7 for par.   He drove it in the water and hit a great cut around to get it on the green and made about a 30‑, 40‑footer for par.   
But it was just a great round of golf.   He played great and it was fun to see.   I was in that position a couple of years ago and, you know, there's something about that magical 63 mark to try to surpass.   It was a lot of fun to see.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I literally didn't even think about the putt that I had on the last to break the mark.   I was just so engrossed in what I was doing and shooting the lowest score possible that I really didn't even pay attention to how many under I was and what I was shooting at the time.   
So I was able to kind of enjoy Dufner's more than I was able to enjoy mine.   But it was tough to see him leave that last putt short.   But I can understand that.   The greens were a little chewed up this afternoon.   Any putt uphill into the grain became difficult because of all the heal prints and the marks on the greens because the greens were so soft from the rain.   I wish he would have gotten it to the hole and had a better chance at it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
STEVE STRICKER:   I feel like I'm in a good spot.   I'm four back at the halfway mark.   Got a lot of golf left and I need to get it in the fairway a little bit better with my driver.   I haven't hit that many drivers around here, maybe about five a round.   
I didn't drive it in the fairway at 18.   When you do that around here it makes things very difficult, makes pars very difficult.   You have got to get it in the fairway and play a lot of holes in the fairway.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
STEVE STRICKER:   I called for a ruling because it looked like I was in a sod seam.   I had taken a practice swing and basically pulled up, you know, a foot by foot area of grass.   And my ball looked like it was right on that seam, as well.   
He deemed that it probably was sod at one point, but the seams had kind of grown through and you can't see them as much.   It wasn't a very good lie, but I was able to get it up an down.  
   
 Q.   Jason doesn't show much emotion.   Could you sense at all coming down the stretch that he was nervous or aware of what he was on the verge of doing?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, he was aware, for sure.   He's very calm.   I'm sure he was churning on the inside.   He just told me while we were signing our cards he was like, "This is a lot for a Friday."   
You know, he hits some great shots when he had to.   The putt that he hit at 17, I thought he made.   I thought he hit that perfectly.   I thought it was going to go to the right at the end and it kind of straightened out and went a little to the left at the end.   He had two really good looks at it to break the record.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
STEVE STRICKER:   What's that?   
   
 Q.   What kind of guy is he?   
STEVE STRICKER:   He's great to play with.   We had a good time playing.   We talked a lot out there.   It was a lot of fun.   He's a good guy.   And you know, he shows really no emotion, but there it was a lot going on on the inside.   He's a big competitor and it showed today.   What he did today, he put up a great number.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Well, I think he will again.   I mean, you never know about Tiger, he could come out tomorrow and shoot 7‑ or 8‑under tomorrow.   I think he's even par going down the last three, I think I just saw while I was in there.   
So I mean, he's not out of it.   He's capable of extraordinary things.   Like I say, if he can post a good one tomorrow, he gets right back in there.   I'm sure he's thinking the same way.   
You know, it's been, what, since 2008 since he's won one.   It seems like a long time and it is a long time, I guess, but his game is trending in the right direction.   He seems happier on and off the golf course.   I'm not worried about him.   I'm sure heel win more to come.
