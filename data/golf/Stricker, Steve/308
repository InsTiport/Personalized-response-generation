   STEVE STRICKER: I had a couple other opportunities, lipped out a couple times, but all in all, it was a good round. I hit the ball well and hit a lot of greens around here for a change, and it was a good one to get back into it.  
  
  Q. What was the difference in your swing today or your putting stroke?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Maybe just a little more focus, a little bit -- I don't know. I drove it well the first two days and didn't make as many birdies as I did today. It was a little bit harder to get the ball closer maybe on the first day. But I don't know, maybe I'm just figuring this course out a little bit. This is a course where I typically don't put up a low number, so this 66 feels pretty good.  
  
  Q. Did you put a lot of pressure on yourself coming into this week to perform well with the PGA TOUR Playoffs for the FedExCup? $10 million is an awful lot of money.   
 STEVE STRICKER: It is a lot of money. I was feeling a little excited and a little amped up last week at home. I was wanting to get here and get it going. It's a good pressure, though. I'm enjoying it. I was very excited and fired up to play with Tiger the first day, and I played well. Yesterday was a little bit not good. I just didn't do very many good things and kind of just plodded myself along, but today I played like I have been. But I'm going to need a lower one tomorrow. I'm going to need another 4- or 5-under round tomorrow to even have a sniff of a chance.
