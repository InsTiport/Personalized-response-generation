  Q.  You had the longest match of the day today.  Just tell us how you feel.   
 STEVE STRICKER:  You know, tired (laughing), but it was a good match.  I'm just happy to be moving on.  I mean, I knew Daniel was going to be a tough match.  He's been playing good this year, and I'm just fortunate to move on.   
  
  Q.  Any turning points in the match that changed the match at all?   
 STEVE STRICKER:  Not really.  We kind of were, I think -- the biggest lead was one.  I was 1-up.  I don't know if he ever had the lead on me or not.  But it was just that way all the way around.  You know, it looked like it could swing one way or the other all day.   
  
  Q.  You've played match play here before and felt comfortable.  You're playing against Hunter Mahan, a first-time player at the Match Play.  Just talk about your competition tomorrow.   
 STEVE STRICKER:  It's going to be tough.   
  
  Q.  All of them.   
 STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, all of them are.  Hunter is going to be especially tough.  He's a good young player.  He drives it good.  He hits it long.  This course is kind of made for long hitters, so I'm going to have to do some other things to kind of offset his length, I think, and chip and putt well and keep it in play and make him make birdies to beat me.
