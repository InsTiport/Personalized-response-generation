Q.   How would you sum up this day?   Besides wet. 
    STEVE STRICKER:   It was all right.   I let a few shots get away on the greens again.   Three‑putted a couple times, missed another short one in there.   So I gave a few away on the greens. 
    But it was a tough day again.   The wind really wasn't much of a factor, but the rain was just nagging enough that it affects how far your ball flies.   Looks like we're going to get it in and beat the rain for the most part, it looks like, which is a good thing. 
    So tomorrow looks good weather‑wise.   That's all good.

Q.   Are you surprised you got it in?   When you woke up this morning, it looked pretty cloudy. 
    STEVE STRICKER:   Saw a huge cell coming our way when I woke up this morning.   There was a lot of green in there.   I didn't see much red or yellow in there.   I thought we'd be playing in a lot more rain than what we did. 
    Really just a little bit on the back side.   Other than that, it was a pretty good day to play.

Q.   What do you have to do to catch Henrik at this point? 
    STEVE STRICKER:   It's going to be pretty tough.   He's playing great.   It's going to have to be some ridiculously low ‑‑ by someone, and he's going to have to stumble, which I'm not seeing happen just because of the way he's been playing the last half of the year. 
    He's played so well, and he's been so consistent and hit the ball so solidly that I don't see that happening tomorrow.

Q.   So are you going to get a ridiculously low score out here on this course the way it's set up? 
    STEVE STRICKER:   Good question.   It's tough to get the ball close on a few of these pin locations.   A few shots, I was up on the green watching Zach come in with the pitch shots.   There was big bounces to them.   They were skidding a little bit with the rain. 
    It was tough to get it close at times.   You had to hit an exceptional shot to have a set up for a birdie shot.   It's going to be hard to hit a low number, I think.

Q.   Are you surprised by Henrik's form?
    STEVE STRICKER:   I'm really not surprised by Henrik's form.   I'm surprised by the rest of the field. 
    We were talking a little bit about that today.   It seems like a lot of lackluster play.   I think guys are flat.   It seems like a lot of guys are tired.   You know, it's the end of the year. 
    Henrik, obviously, is playing great.   If he wasn't there, we'd have a great tournament lined up.   But he's playing great, and he's going to be tough to catch.

Q.   To that end, Tiger was asked how can you make the schedule more manageable at the end?   And he said play like Stricker.   Have a Stricker schedule.   So what do you think of his saying the solution to that is? 
    STEVE STRICKER:   I think we're going to see that happen.   I think we're going to see some of these guys taking some of these playoff events off, especially next year when there's four in a row leading up. 
    And then the guys play Bridgestone and the PGA.   Some guys feel they need to play wind ham.   So there's a lot of golf there at the end of the year. 
    And then like I say, four playoff events, a week off, Ryder Cup.   I see next year some of those top players taking a break in there maybe to refresh themselves and get ready. 
    Thank you.
