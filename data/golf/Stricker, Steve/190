  STEVE STRICKER:   The wind we were playing in‑‑ so I just tried to hit it on the front part of the green there.  
   
 Q.   That's what I was calling.   I said you had about 215 but a 20‑yard wind, thought we got 230, he's got to play it short right or try to cut a 3‑wood and I don't think he wants to do that.   
STEVE STRICKER:   No, I really didn't, although 3‑wood would have got me over the water.  
   
 Q.   Into the crowd probably.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Into the crowd somewhere and probably would have made bogey anyways.   It's just a hard hole, and you know, just to drive it in the fairway is good.   But then you're only partly done.   
So it's tough.   It's a tough finishing few holes, but I hung in there.   I had a lot of opportunities today, made some, missed some but overall a good, solid start.   
   
 Q.   The wind is supposed to come from the east all week long, you've been playing it from the east, it's laying down, hopefully you're only going to get 15 or 20 the last few days?   
STEVE STRICKER:   That sounds good, doesn't it, 15 or 20.  
The course is playable.   You can see it in the scores.   It's still playable, whether we have this kind of wind or not, so it's manageable out there, and you just have to play hard and play well.
