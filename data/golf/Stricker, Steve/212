 Q. Keeping it in perspective, you're two shots off the lead. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, and that's what we were talking about out there, even when we were 3-over for the day. If I could just hang on and make a birdie or play even on the way in, you know, the way we got there wasn't ideal, shooting 7-under, and then shooting over par today. But if we would have shot 2-under yesterday and 1-under today, we'd be feeling pretty good. 
 The way we got there wasn't ideal, but we're still in there, only a couple back, and anything could happen on the weekend.

 Q. This is the kind of golf course you see all around the field that a bounce here and a bounce there --
 STEVE STRICKER: It's tough. If you get it going, you start driving it in the fairway and you get some opportunities, you can get on a roll. But vice versa, I was on the other end of the spectrum today where it was tough going all the way around. Pulled the wrong clubs, bad decisions, didn't make any putts. You know, it just was a tough day all together.
