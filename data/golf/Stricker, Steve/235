 Q. First of all, how much did the course change on you today, and how much do you expect it to continue changing through the weekend? 
 STEVE STRICKER: I think the course was actually a little bit softer this morning. The wind died down a little bit, so I think that's why you're seeing some good scores out there. It's still fairly soft. The greens are pretty receptive. 
 Like I say, it was probably windier when we got about two or three holes into our round than it is right now. Yeah, I expect to see some good scores here today, especially if the conditions stay like they are.

 Q. To be up at the top of the leaderboard here heading into the weekend in an event like this, what's that like to have that and be in contention? 
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, it's a good start. We're halfway through. I haven't had a great track record here over the years. I think only one Top 10. So hopefully looking to improve on that. 
 But it's still a long ways to go. Tomorrow and Sunday are both, obviously, important rounds. But take one day as it comes and hopefully have a chance come Sunday.
