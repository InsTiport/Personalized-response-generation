  Q. Excited about whenever you play again?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, get.  
  
  Q. Any big difference between yesterday and today?   
 STEVE STRICKER: No. It's a little more wind probably than what we had when we finished last night, but other than that, the course is still in fairly soft, but in good shape.   
  
  Q. Excited about the next -- whenever you play again?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, get back out there in about 40 minutes. Quick turnaround and looking forward to it.   
 15, drove it in the fairway and caught a little bit of a squirter off a utility club, just kind of shot to the right and plugged in the bunker. I was worried about even getting it over the gorse and I had to try to get it over and didn't get it up-and-down for a double.  
 Then hit a good drive and a 3-wood up in front of the green at 16, and didn't hit a very good pitch shot, maybe about 20 feet past and made it.   
  
  Q. Your thoughts on today, maybe finishing?   
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, it's a long day, but I'm just glad we are going to be able to get out there. We'll finish today barring anymore weather problems. Excited to get back out there.
