  Q. If the TOUR Championship were this week, would you be ready, and if not, how are you going to get ready over the next week or so?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, I obviously need rest. I had not a lot of game this week at all, any day really. Yesterday was okay, but today I came out real quiet again.   
 Yeah, I'll just rest up for the next four or five days probably and start working at it come Thursday or Friday.  
  
  Q. You were in a position where you could have won the FedExCup a couple years ago with Tiger Woods, again, No. 1. What will you take from that experience?   
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, obviously I've got to play better. You know, this was just a little hiccup this week. I'm giving myself a break with that and just kind of writing it off and saying that I was tired. Really, I was. I've just got to get prepared.   
  
  Q. You were one of the best during the regular season and you've been one of the best during the Playoffs. There's going to be a reset. What do you think about that system going forward?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I enjoy it. I think the fans are going to enjoy. It's going to lend itself to a lot of excitement, I think, especially the last round. I guess we're just going to have to see, but I think there's going to be a lot of excitement, more so than the other two years. It's going to be kind of a shootout at East Lake.   
  
  Q. Rough day, rough week maybe for you, but really no harm done. Comment on the whole week.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Knowing that going in probably wasn't the best way to prepare, knowing at worst I was going to be second. But I really had nothing all week. Yesterday I played decent; today I just got off to a bad start, bogeyed the first hole, doubled the next. I was just not in it. I just didn't have a good frame of mind going. You know, that leads to poor swings and poor thoughts and poor decisions. So I'm looking forward to this week and getting some rest, going home and leaving the clubs alone for a good four days and then getting back at it come Thursday or Friday.  
  
  Q. In what ways is this like '07 and in what ways is it different, because it seems to be almost dÃ©jÃ -vu the way it's shaping up here.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it does. Obviously it's the same because I've got an opportunity to win again and Tiger is going to be probably the guy to beat, as we all knew he would be coming into the whole thing. But I'm just excited that I have the opportunity to do it. I'm going to be 250 points behind. I don't know what that means. All I know is I'll be 250 points behind. I don't know what kind of place that -- I don't know what it means. All I know is I have a chance, and I'm just going to have to play well.   
 There's going to be a number of guys in the mix; it won't just be Tiger and I. 3, 4 and 5 control their own destinies, too. There will be a bunch of guys involved.
