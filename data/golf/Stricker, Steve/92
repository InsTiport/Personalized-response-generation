 Q.   How does it feel being back?   You're the other guy whose been coming back after a long break.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it's good to play again.   I got here this morning and I got going.   I got off to a good start.   I hit one bad shot that really cost me.   I hit it in the water at 12 and ended up making double.   
I had ‑‑ I missed another little short 5‑footer for birdie.   
But other than that I managed my game okay.   I didn't hit it particularly solid at times, but kind of struggled with either hanging it a little to the right or pulling it a little bit.   But overall I thought I kind of managed my way around the course okay.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   I've been hitting it in the fairway, but not the proper action that I've been used to seeing.   
   
 Q.   Is it not turning over?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it's not turning over.   So it's kind of a different look for me.   I haven't just had the time to work on it and get it worked out.   
But they're going fairly straight.   That's the good news.   Sometimes ‑‑ there's not a lot on them, I'm not hitting the ball that hard, but they're going in the fairway.   So they're not costing me, but it's not going the way I am used to seeing it.   It was good to get a round under my belt and hopefully shoot a little bit lower tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I didn't hit a lot of great iron shots.   Not a lot of crispy ones.  
(Wind noise.)  
Hopefully, I'll go to the range here in a little bit and try to work on it.   See if I can do a little bit better tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   It's hot out there, and not used to walking probably as much as I did today.   But other than that, I don't have any problems.   
   
 Q.   During the par‑3 contest did you and Tiger compare notes on your respective time off?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Not really.   No.   
   
 Q.   Looked like a fun time was had by all.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, we had a really good time.   We didn't really talk much about the surgery or anything.   
   
 Q.   Are you curious to see how he does?  
STEVE STRICKER:   I am.  
   
 Q.   He 3‑putted 1 for bogey, came back and birdied 2.   I think he's par, par.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Is he?   Yeah, I'm just as interested as anybody to see how he does, how he plays.   
On the par‑3s, the little shots that he hit yesterday, they all looked pretty good.   And it looked like he was coming away with some confidence.   So, it will be fun to see how he does.  
   
 Q.   Were you a little more nervous on the first tee?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I was and I wasn't.   I really had nothing to lose.   I haven't played a PGA TOUR event since August of last year, so nine months away from this TOUR.   
I played a couple times in December that doesn't really mean much, as far as the PGA TOUR goes, but, yeah, it's been a long haul to get back to here.   I worked hard and I still got a lot of work to do.   Now I got to go to work on my game.   I've been just working on trying to get fit and just get ready and strong enough to play.   
   
 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   I'll probably play New Orleans and then I won't get in Match Play.
