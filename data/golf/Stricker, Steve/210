   STEVE STRICKER: When I was warming up on the range, I started to feel better.  
  
  Q. Left arm?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it's my left arm. No pain or anything. It's not a pain issue, it's kind of a strength issue more than anything.  
  
  Q. You had a cortisone shot?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I did, Monday.  
  
  Q. Where did they do it?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Right in the front up here.  
  
  Q. How big a round was this to test yourself?   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I was a little worried about it, worried about how I've been struggling with my swing a little bit, too, because of the strength issue. It felt like I had a little bit more strength today, and it's gotten better really every day I feel like since Monday after the shot. They said it takes about three to five days for it to kick in, but it felt better today.  
  
  Q. It's not the easiest thing to measure yourself distance-wise against Gary. But it looked to me like you hit a really good one on 5.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I drove the ball actually -- I don't know if my stats are going to show it. There were a lot of first cuts. But I thought I drove the ball nicely today and played pretty solid all the way around.  
  
  Q. Bermuda rough doesn't have any particular --  
 STEVE STRICKER: There's really no -- the doctor says I can't injure it any more. I'm going to have an MRI on Tuesday to see to what extent it's going on, but really it's just strength more than anything.  
  
  Q. Is it a nerve thing or --  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it is. It's a herniated disk. I actually found it last December, and my arm was about 20 pounds weaker than my right arm. So I went to work, worked out, first part of the season got all the strength back, and it's kind of just showing up again.  
  
  Q. I heard you snapped yourself with a bow.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, well, my arm caved about here. The doe got away, too. She was like, what's that idiot doing?
