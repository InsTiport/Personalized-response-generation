Q.   Well, that was a lot of fun, four birdies in the last five holes, and I know you were watching the finish.   You never know on the TOUR anymore, do you?
STEVE STRICKER:   No, you never know, and you've just got to keep plugging away.   I'm thinking I'm playing for second and third place, or I was really thinking third or fourth at the time, and then you just never know, though.   18 is a good hole.   If you don't get it in play‑‑ yeah, you've just got to keep plugging. 
And I feel horrible for Jim.   He led 71 holes, and then just had a bad last hole.   It's a cruel game sometimes. 

Q.   When he put those three birdies up on the first three holes today and you had made par on the first four, did you just figure, this is a different tournament now?
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, that put me eight back.   Yeah, you know, at that point you're just trying to shoot a good round.   But I still had Ernie Els in the back of any mind.   He was seven back at the turn with nine to go at the British Open.   You just never know.   You've just got to keep playing, and that's why we finish it out and play them all.   I'm so shocked to see what happened to Jim there on the last.

Q.   For you, though, the four birdies on the last five holes looked pure and a lot of momentum going into next week. 
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I haven't played putts like that for a while, and all of a sudden they were all going in.   That's exciting for me.   I keyed on a lot of good things this week with my putting, and today was better yet.   Made a lot of nice putts and excited going forward.

Q.   Any thoughts on Kiawah?
STEVE STRICKER:   I've never been there.   I have the next few days to learn it a little bit and see what we have, get over there and see what kind of course we have and learn to play it.   But I've got plenty of time, got two days to rest up a little bit.
