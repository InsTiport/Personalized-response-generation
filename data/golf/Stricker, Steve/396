Q.  After you played just the 1st and 18th I figured you were on your way today.
STEVE STRICKER:  You know, you shoot 2 under and you just got lapped today, too, which is hard to believe.  I mean, we're in a major tournament, and the scores that    I just looked at the leaderboard.  It's really just the top guys that are putting up those 5 , 6 , 7 unders, and that's why they're at the top of the leaderboard, I guess.  Yeah, my 2 under round just kind of held my place, really.

I had opportunities out there again, which is another positive side.  I had a couple of lip outs on the putts, turned even, scrambled a little bit on a couple holes today but really played well on the back side.  I just didn't get many putts to fall except for the last.
Q.  How long was that putt?
STEVE STRICKER:  Probably 20, 25 feet.  Longest one I've made in a while.  But it was good to end that way.  I mean, it's still a difficult course.  You still have to put it in the fairway and you still have to do all the right things, and obviously a lot of guys are doing that.
Q.  Were you kind of glimpsing at the leaderboard?
STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah.  Like I said, you only see those first eight guys, and they were all going.  Like I said, for the most part, there's still over par rounds, evens, those kind of rounds.  You just try to hang in there, and hopefully I can have a low one tomorrow and move up into that Top 10.
Q.  It looked like the top 12 guys were 60 under par.  Have you ever seen that in a major?
STEVE STRICKER:  No, but the conditions here, a little firmer fairways, the greens a little bit firmer, obviously that rain really softened things up for guys.  Obviously they're putting well, too.  There's less traffic on the greens, too, today.  You only have 70 guys so there's less traffic on there.
Q.  What makes the back nine more difficult than the front?
STEVE STRICKER:  You know, I haven't really even thought about it.  There's good holes on both sides.  I mean, you have 13 and 17 that can come up and grab you, but there's also good holes on the front side that can get you, as well.

I mean, you've got the best players in the world here, and they're proving that by shooting the scores they're shooting.  I just think the PGA sets it up fair.  It's not overboard, it's not to a point where    you want good shots, and sometimes in other majors, you kind of aim for the center of the green and try to make a bomb to get a birdie, and it's not that way here.
