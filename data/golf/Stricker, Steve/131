 Q.   Today's round, did the rain this morning change the course for you at all?  
STEVE STRICKER:   It made it very playable.   It softened things up and the greens were perfect.   Everything was holding.   The fairways, you know, were not running, so they played wider than they are.   You could be aggressive with some of your iron shots knowing that the ball was going to stop.   It was a benefit to have that rain this morning for sure.  
   
 Q.   Good first day for you?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, good start, couple under around here, trying to get a feel for what's going on.   You never know what to expect the first round and as the tournament goes on.   But a good feel, birdied the last, always a good feel, just keep plugging.
