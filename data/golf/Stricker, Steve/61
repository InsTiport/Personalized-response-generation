Q. Why a feather?
STEVE STRICKER: I have no idea.
Q. Is that the weirdest thing you got?
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it's pretty bizarre.  Not sure.  That was nice of her.
Q. Maybe it will help you this afternoon?
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I need some energy.
Q. A couple of big birdies the last three holes.  Does that get you going a bit for the afternoon?
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I wanted to play the next couple of rounds.  And after bogeying No. 11, I knew I needed at least one on the way in.  So to get a couple was nice.
The course played pretty tough.  Wind's out of the north, very soft.  It's playing long.  Some of those short holes played into the wind that normally are scoring holes that we were hitting some longer clubs.
But it was tough to get the ball close because of the wet conditions.  Happy to be around.
Q. Zach said this is the hardest the course has played since the end of September of '03, I think.  Do you agree with that?
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I mentioned that to him inside.  This is pretty hard today.  You know, it's wet.  It's wet.  It's tough to control your ball out of the fairway.  If you hit it in the rough, it's thick and lush.  So you have to be in the fairway.  But even out on the fairway, it's hard to control it because the fairways are wet.
We're lucky to be playing.  The course took a lot of rain.  It's still in great shape, but it's tough.
