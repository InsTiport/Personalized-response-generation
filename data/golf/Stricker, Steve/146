 Q.   Steve, if you can just comment on your day?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it was a good day.   Again a bit of a struggle out there again at times.   The course is firming up and getting fast this weekend.   This whole weekend it was a little firmer and faster.   At times a bit of a struggle.   Played solid, though, all week.   Especially with the short game, the putting, getting it up‑and‑down, getting it around in general was good.   
So happy with the finish and good start so far with these three events I've played.  
   
 Q.   So how many strokes do you think you saved Tiger on the greens this week?   
STEVE STRICKER:   I have no idea.   Who knows, he might have putted just as good without my help, who knows.   But you know, he's happy, he feels really good about what he's doing on the greens, and so that's a good thing; even though he's going to clip me by a couple shots.  
   
 Q.   Does that make you feel pretty good knowing that you may have helped him a little bit?   Do you get some secret satisfaction?   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I guess I do.   But it's just like I've said all week, it's kind of the nature of our game.   Older players have done it with me, and I'm now one of those older players I guess, and when somebody asks me for their help, I tend to give it to them.   
You know, Tiger and I have always talked about putting, and you know, he had me look at him again this week and you know, some things clicked with him it looked like, and he was really excited about what he was doing there.   But he's got a lot of talent.   Like I said, he might have done this without my help.   
But it's good to see him.   It's good for us.   It's good for the TOUR, and I'm happy with the way I played.   
   
 Q.   Has he reached out to you other times when you weren't at an event?   Has he ever called you before for putting?   
STEVE STRICKER:   You know, we've texted back and forth about feels with little wedge shots, putting, yeah.   We've touched base when we haven't been on TOUR together at the same time   usually.   We've talked one other time over the phone, too.   We just like to‑‑ you know, he's the best player in the world, I could pick his brain all day long.   He likes what I do putting and some of my wedge play, so he kind of picks my brain on that, too.   Yeah, there's been a few times.
