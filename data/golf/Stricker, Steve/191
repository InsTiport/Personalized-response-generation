  STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I made a lot of mental mistakes, to tell you the truth.   I hit it poorly at some crucial times, drives at 10 and 11.   I just didn't have my best stuff.   And at times I hit it right up on the green and had a position for a chip.   
And he played on the other hand very well.   He was driving it well like always and not making many mistakes.   And that's what I needed to do is not make any mistakes, but I made it today.  
   
 Q.   Hearing what you just said people would be shocked around the world saying you had a lot of mental errors?  
STEVE STRICKER:   I stepped up on 10 after winning No. 9, 2‑down.   I've been hitting 3‑wood all tournament.   And for some reason I hit a driver today to get it down there farther.   I've learned in the past, if the hole doesn't set up for me and I take out the driver and tried to force it and block it way to the right in the desert.   That really irritated me, because I've struggled with the tee ball over the years, and I should have sent the 3‑wood down there.
