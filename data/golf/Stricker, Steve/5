Q. Steve Stricker, can you take us through your round a little bit.
STEVE STRICKER:   It wasn't that exciting really.  Actually, it was.  I started off with a double on 10, my first hole of the day.  I was a quick 4 over after five.  So not a great start.  But hung in there, finished 4 over.
It's a great, fair test today.  The course is set up nicely.  You can tell by a few of the guys that some good scores were shot.  I thought they did a great job setting it up.  It was hard but fair, and you could score if you hit it well.
Q. Did you see 5 under out there?
STEVE STRICKER:   Not for me, how I've been hitting it.  These guys are talented.  They hit it a long ways.  If you drive it in the fairway, the fairways have a lot of roll to them.  They're probably coming in with some pretty short irons.
The key is driving it in the fairway, though.  5, 4, 3 unders, those are great scores.
Q. How does this course compare to previous U.S. Open courses?
STEVE STRICKER:   This is my third time around here in a Major.  This is one of the tougher ones that we'll play.  Just the green complexes make it very difficult.  The rough, the other Open that I played here in '06, the rough was high and thick, scoring was tough.  So this is as hard as you're going to find at any U.S. Open, but a fair test.
Especially given the conditions today, no wind hardly at all and fairly soft greens.  Yeah, it was a good, fair test, and you could score if you hit it well.
Q. Any adjustments today going into tomorrow?
STEVE STRICKER:   I got my work cut out.  I'll have to -- I didn't drive it particularly well.  So I have to get it in the fairway a few more times.  Shoot a good one just to see if I can hang around for the weekend.
