 Q.  Steve, kind of an up-and-down opening round for you. 
 STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, I hit it fine, just never really got anything going.  I had some opportunities that I didn't make and just made a couple bogeys, though, and didn't make a whole lot of birdies, but got it under par, and hopefully get a good one this afternoon. 

 Q.  I thought that you were getting a little bit tired when I saw you last week, when I walked with you last week at the BMW, but you took a couple days off and you appear to be refreshed this week. 
 STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, I'm a little sluggish I feel like, and yesterday was a long day.  But you know, we've got a lot riding on the line and I'm still fired up.  I'm excited to play.  I'm playing with Tiger, you know, it's an exciting group, so it's a lot of fun.
