 Q. You had two rounds of 71, and today you came out and shot 68. Can you explain why? 
 STEVE STRICKER: No, I can't. You know, I've been close the other two days. Yesterday it could have been 69 pretty easy. I had a couple opportunities that I didn't make. So I think today I just cleaned up the round a little bit and played a little bit better and made some good swings and a couple of good putts.

 Q. Talk about the back nine. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, you know, it could have been better, too. I birdied 10, 11 and 12, and then 13 I had it right up around the green in two and ended up making bogey, and that kind of halted my round. If I could have made birdie there, who knows what I could have kept doing on the way in.
 I'm in position for tomorrow, I'm a couple back, looks like maybe three by the time they're done, but I've got a good opportunity for tomorrow, and that's all I wanted.
