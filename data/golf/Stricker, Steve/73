Q. Seemed like it was tough sledding for a lot of guys out there on Saturday.  What do you take away from your 3rd Round?
STEVE STRICKER: I find a lot of positives in my round today.  Even though I shot 1-over I hit the ball better today than I did the previous two days.  I didn't get it in the hole today.
I had some opportunities to get some momentum going and just stalled out a couple times and it's tough to do on a course like this when birdies are tough to get.
So, when you have those opportunities and you're not making them, you feel like you're kind of slipping those chances and letting them go by.  Yeah, I hit it nicely, I made a couple mistakes but scrambled well, too, and so hopefully I can get some more putts to go in tomorrow.
Q. Overall, what would you say the state of your game is through 54 holes?
STEVE STRICKER: Good.  I'm excited.  I hadn't been in the last group for quite awhile and my nerves weren't too bad and I handled it, I thought, okay.
Missed a short little one right at 1, which wasn't the way to start and bogeyed 2, so wasn't the greatest of starts but I fought back nicely and played nicely from there on out.
Q. What do you have to do to be able to launch yourself into contention on Sunday?
STEVE STRICKER: I have to get off to a good start tomorrow, make a couple birdies early on and get myself right in there.  Only 4 back.  It's not a long ways back and probably a better position for me to be in than out in front leading.  So, we'll see what I can do tomorrow.
