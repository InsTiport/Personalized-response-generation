 Q. So your round is just going along and then all of a sudden, what an unbelievable birdie stretch; what happened? 
 STEVE STRICKER: I started hitting it in the fairway. I was struggling hitting in the fairway to start with, and then started getting in the fairway and giving myself some opportunities, and then made a couple of long-ish putts and then I hit one in there under a foot. So it all came together there at the end and had maybe a 20-footer on 9, also but didn't make it.
 Just came together and made a couple of putts and hit a couple of close shots.

 Q. You've been battling a little bit lately; does it feel like it's clicking? Changing caddies, everything is different; is it yelling?
 STEVE STRICKER: It's getting a little bit better. My driving is still troubling me at times. It's just I'm not very consistent. For a stretch of holes, I'll drive it pretty good, and then all of the sudden for a stretch, it won't be very good.
 So I've got to get that ironed out. I've been working hard at it, changed drivers a couple of weeks ago and it's been better, but still not as consistent as I would like. 

 Q. Did you almost think you had a hole-in-one there? 
 STEVE STRICKER: I did. I did. It was curving in there, and I went to pick up my tee, and then I thought it had a chance, but you know, I'll take that tap-in any time.
