   STEVE STRICKER: My short game in general saved me, and yeah, I think I only maybe hit like six greens in regulation I think. I was on the edge a lot where I use my putter and stuff like that, but it was tough. The ball is sitting down. The fairways are very tight. The ball is sitting down and they are wet and it's tough to make clean contact. At least I'm having a hard time making solid contact a lot. It's a lot of squirters, so it's pretty tough.   
  
  Q. Kind of a day to survive?  
 STEVE STRICKER: For sure. You know, I think we caught the better end of the deal this afternoon. The wind, actually the rain died down. It didn't rain that much this afternoon. I think the morning wave had rain all day in their wave of it.  
 Yeah, I think we definitely caught the end of the deal, but still very difficult. The scores are showing that, too. The course is holing up well, and it's tough to get the ball close and tough to make birdies out there.   
  
  Q. Surprised to see someone at 9-under?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I am kind of surprised to see them keep going. Not that they are not great players but conditions are tough. You can't miss the fairway and when you do hit it in the fairway, it's difficult, as well, just because of the wetness of the fairways.
