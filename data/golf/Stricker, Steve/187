 Q.   Good playing out there today.   First ten holes looked like you might shoot the grass right light off this place.  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it was fun.   I played really solid all the way through 11 and then missed that putt at 11 and kind of lost my thought process there for a little bit.   
Hit a poor tee ball at 12.   I actually played pretty good coming in but didn't get any putts to drop.   All in all, you know, a good, solid round today and a lot to build on over the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Is it frustrating?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it is.   Felt like I let a really good one slip away today.   I should have been right maybe a couple shots better, but that's golf, too.   You got to realize that, that I'm in a good position.   When -- I realize I'm in a good place heading in the weekend.  
   
 Q.   If that's your bad round, it could be a pretty good week.  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.   Just got to limit a couple mistakes.   I hit a poor tee ball at 12 and then really didn't get a very good break at 15, you know.   Hit it in the bunker.   I didn't see that bunker.   
Hit a lot of good shots, good putts.   Some just didn't go in coming in.  
   
 Q.   The golf course is like on 16 you hit a beautiful wedge in there, hits on the down side and scoots 20 feet past.   There's nothing you can do about that.  
STEVE STRICKER:   No.   I've been aggressive, I've been hitting good shots and giving myself a lot of opportunities which that's key when scoring is good.   If I can keep doing this weekend, I'll be in good shape.  
   
 Q.   All told, tell me about the first ten holes, six birdies during that period of time.   What was that feeling like playing that well?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, I was kind of on cruise control.   Everything was going really well.   Hit a lot of good shots.   Gave myself a lot of opportunities.   Hit them in there really close.   
Then, you know, I just hit a poor drive at 12.   Still should have made par, though.   I had an opening there to get it up around the green.   Didn't hit a very good second shot out of trouble.   
But hit it good coming in and just didn't make a couple of putts that I could have in the last few holes.  
   
 Q.   So what do you attribute far better play here this week than you have in previous attempts here?  
STEVE STRICKER:   You know, I've always been real consistent here, you know, around Top 20, Top 15, couple Top 10s, but I enjoy coming here, I really do.   
I enjoy the course and it's going to get more difficult I think but we had a nice day.   The wind let down a little bit for us today.   I enjoy coming here and the weather and the course.  
   
 Q.   Key for the weekend for you is?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Keep doing what I've been doing.   Keep giving myself an opportunity.   I gave myself a bunch today.   I didn't capitalize on the ones coming in.   I need to do more the next two days.
