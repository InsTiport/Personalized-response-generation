   STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, coming in on the second 18 there a little bit, but it doesn't matter.  I mean, he's so strong and he gets it on the green out of the rough.  I can't do that.  I mean, I'm just hacking mine out of the rough and I come up short of the green.  He finds a way to get a lot of club on the ball and he gets it up there, and that's what's amazing, when he drives it in the rough he finds a way to get it up there on the green and sometimes makes birdies. 

 Q.  You smiled your way around watching him, but what were you thinking? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  I mean, what can you do?  I mean, he's making it from everywhere, he holes out a bunker shot.  I have it inside of him a couple times, and I walk off with par and he makes a birdie.  I'm grinding like heck just to make those putts and not getting them in there.  You know, what can you do?  I just kept trying to play the way I play.  I was playing my own game.  We had a lot of fun, not much else I can do, just keep trying hard.  But it was unbelievable after a while, what he was doing. 

 Q.  Does it have any different effect on you as a competitor when you're watching all of those go in instead of just hearing the cheers? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  You know, yeah, I think when you're in the group, especially a couple of them I had inside of him, and on 5 it actually looks like he's going to make a bogey.  I've got 15 feet for birdie, and now all of a sudden he makes birdie and I make par.  You sit back and think to yourself, how does that happen?  I just lost a shot there and I played the hole perfectly and he makes a birdie and I make par. 
 It gets to you after a while.  But you just tell him, "nice shot," and you go on. 

 Q.  Are you looking forward to a different pairing? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  Actually, no, we've had a good time.  It's been good for me, too.  I feel really comfortable with him.  I think it's helped my confidence a lot.  I stand up there and I drive it well and am hitting good irons.  I've actually been hitting a lot of good putts, too, and I've been hitting a lot on the edges.  That's just the way it goes sometimes, but I've enjoyed it the last couple tournaments.  I've just got to worry about myself and hopefully put up a real low one and get all these putts to go in. 

 Q.  At this point does the points chase just kind of fall out of it and now you're just playing to play the best you can and see if you can come -- bring your name up on the leaderboard? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  Yeah, I mean, if I don't win, I'm hoping that he wins, to tell you the truth, as far as the FedExCup goes.  If he wins, he takes all those points with him.  That's the way I'm looking at it. 
 I'm still going to have to play well.  Phil is just behind me in the points list, and K.J. Choi and guys like that, where if they play well they could end up passing me.  I want to protect my spot, too.  I want to make sure I stay at least second on that list.  So I've got a lot riding on this weekend, and I want to play well. 

 Q.  Looked like you missed some putts on the high side.  Are you still having a hard time getting your speed? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  I don't know.  Some look like they want to break and some look like they don't.  They actually are -- they broke a lot, I thought, today.  I missed this one on the low side and I thought I put it up there plenty high enough.  I missed the one on 11, the par 3, I hit it in there about six feet and missed that on the low side.  A couple putts where I thought that they weren't going to go ended up snapping off.  A mixed day, a little bit of everything.
