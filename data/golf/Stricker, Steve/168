 Q.   Do you want to talk about your hole‑in‑one today?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it was about the only highlight of the day, but yeah, it was hard to see it go in, but it was a 6‑iron from about‑‑ I don't even know the yardage anymore.   It was pretty early in the round.   Yeah, the highlight of the day.   Really it was pretty cool, and all we could see was the reaction from the crowd up by the green.  
   
 Q.   At the time you didn't know it, but it comes with a $100,000 scholarship donated from BMW to the Evans Scholars and the WGA.   Do you want to talk about that?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, the Evans Scholars is an important part of this tournament and the Western Golf Association.   They've been associated with the Evans Scholars for a number of years, and they've always been an integral part of this tournament here at the BMW Championship.   It's nice to win some money for the Evans Scholars.   Got to meet a lot of the kids over the years through this event.   They come out and caddie for us some pro‑am days, so it's good.   Yeah, it's a good cause for a deserving kid.
