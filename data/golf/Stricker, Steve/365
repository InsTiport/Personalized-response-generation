 Q. Describe what the Presidents Cup week has been like for you. 
 STEVE STRICKER:  It's been a lot to me, just to get together with these guys.  For me personally it's been 11 years.  For everybody to come together like this -- we had such a good time off the course, and I think that contributed to our play on the course I think. 

 Q.  You've had such a great career at two different stages.  Put this into perspective from where you were 11 years ago to two years ago. 
 STEVE STRICKER:  It's night and day.  Three years ago I was fighting for my card and now to be a part of this is remarkable and unbelievable at times.  So, just fortunate.  Fortunate to be a part of this.  We had a great week.  You know, what can I say?  I'm at a loss for words.  But I had so much fun with the guys and got to reconnect with a lot of them that I had not seen for so many years because of my poor play. 
 This week it's all about the team.
