 Q.  8-under halfway home here at THE PLAYERS.  How would you character your effort through the first two days?  
STEVE STRICKER: Yesterday was a little bit more solid than today's round.  Scrambled a few times here and there, put myself in positions that you don't want to be in around this TPC Sawgrass course, but overall I'm doing some good things and managing my game well and doing what I'm supposed to be doing.   
 Q.  This is your 21st start here, you only have one top-10 finish, in those couple of decades, what have you learned that you're putting into play here of just how to get around this golf course?  
STEVE STRICKER: I think it is just not to challenge it at times.  So many tournaments over the course of the year that we're so aggressive and you go for all the par-5s in two and sometimes going for a par-5 here in two isn't the best thing.  Laying back and trying to wedge it in there, you just got to know what the course can give you and what you're capable of doing around here and that's the tough balance you try to find.   
 Q.  Having great success on the Champions Tour, how much of that has maybe played a part that you're doing so well here?  
STEVE STRICKER: A lot, I think.  I think both tours have helped me at each spot.  When I played the PGA TOUR Champions and have some success out there it gives me confidence out here.  I test my game under the gun out there when I've gotten into contention and then I played fairly well out here, I put together some like tournaments with three good rounds and I'm lacking a round.  So hopefully this weekend can I kind of put all four together and see what happens.
