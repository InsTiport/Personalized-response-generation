  Q. Obviously anticlimactic with the match being over, but you, yourself, nice victory.   
 STEVE STRICKER: When I saw Greg Norman come out and start following us on 13, and the boards were turned off, and I couldn't tell what was going on, you know. I figured it's going to come down to a couple of the last matches.   
 I knew as soon as Tiger won in front of me, I knew it was over. Yeah, it was pretty anticlimactic, but you still want to win your match. You still want to win. Y.E. started to play well at the end, but it was a good victory for all of us. A lot of guys played well this week.
