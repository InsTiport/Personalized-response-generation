 Q. You solidified your position in the FedExCup points, pretty good week and a really strong finish. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, thank you very much. It was a little disappointing the way I played today, got off to just a bad start, a couple over after 3, not really what you're looking for to get off to a start when you're trying to win a golf tournament. So a little disappointed with that, but hung in there and finished strong with an eagle. 
 I get to go home for a day and rest up and get ready for Chicago.

 Q. Tell us about that second shot at 18. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, we were in between clubs a little bit, but I took a little extra club and hit it a little higher and softer, and it came off perfect. Nice to finish up with an eagle here and gain a little momentum going into next week. I'm looking forward to next week. It's close to home, and hopefully the weather will be good and should be a lot of fun.
