 Q. Nicely done. Great finish. Tell me about the shot at 18. Or 9 rather.
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, 9. I had a little bit of a hanging lie in the rough, when I had a great lie in the rough. And you never know how it's going to come out, but it came out perfect and scooted right up to the back of the green. 
 I was just looking to get my four and get out of there. And sometimes that's when you make birdies. But yeah, good finish, and you know, good start to the tournament. 

 Q. And then the hole before you drop a 25-footer, the one putt of any distance or anything that you made all day, so really some nice momentum.
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah. Really, you're right. We played good. We lost David Toms at the turn, but Mark Wilson and I, we kind of fed off one another. I think he played great, played steady all day long and had a lot of opportunities. And you know, even though it was a twosome it was a good group.

 Q. When we talked on Wednesday, everybody said, probably not in the 59s or 60s. This is going to be one of those weeks where you're going to need to shoot 64s and 5s and 6s, but you don't have to go nutty?
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, you're probably right. Those always help, those little 60s or 61s or 2s, those always help. But you're right. I think you're going to have to be consistently in the mid to upper 60s all week long, and it's a little bit firmer than years past and makes things just a touch more difficult.

 Q. Good luck to you.
