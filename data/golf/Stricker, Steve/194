Q.   Steve, 4‑under par 66 today, great start?
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, thanks.   Yeah, a little sluggish at times.   It was a quick turnaround from last week to this week and still thinking about the win last week, but off to a good start and get to come back tomorrow morning and finished up with two birdies, which is always good.

Q.   Talk a little about the conditions out there this afternoon?
STEVE STRICKER:   Wind picked up a little bit but not like normal here.   It can blow pretty strong here, and play very difficult.   The wind was down, probably only about a ten‑mile‑an‑hour wind all day today. 
So scoring is good, and you know, it was still a tough course.   You've still got to work your way around there, and pick your spots. 

Q.   Just a totally different golf course, too.   What's the key to‑‑
STEVE STRICKER:   From last week you mean?   The key is to get in the fairways, and it's hard to do here.   I hit about three drives where I thought I was in the fairway and walking up there and I'm a foot or two in the rough.   From that point, you're just trying to get it up on the green somewhere and make a par.   So that's totally different from last week where we had big, wide fairways and more wind last week than what we had today. 
But just way more generous off the tees.

Q.   And just lastly, the confidence that you have right now, this early in the season, and how that feels?
STEVE STRICKER:   It feels good.   When you can win, just boosts that /TK‑FDZ level way up there.   After a good round today, I only played the Pro‑Am yesterday, really took it easy for two days, and got some rest more so than anything.   So it was a good start.   Looking forward to tomorrow.
