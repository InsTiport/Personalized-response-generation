  STEVE STRIKER: It was really important. I had not made too many birdies the first few days here, and I didn't struggle going around here, but I didn't drive it in the fairway that much in the practice rounds and didn't make my birdies, and I really didn't know what to expect today and maybe that was a good things, I had no expectations, birdieing the first three and hitting it in there on the next two and didn't make birdies there, it just kind of settled me down and got me going on the right foot.  
  
  Q. What does this do for your expectations going into tomorrow?   
 STEVE STRICKER: You have to take one day at a time here in every tournament. This is just a good start. One round under my belt, and you know, take tomorrow as it comes and go from there.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the difficulty of the closing holes?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, the closing holes are tough. You have to suck it up hitting those shots in there. 15 through 18, I told my caddie, if we could play those even for the tournament, we would be really doing well, and we got off to a good start on those holes today, birdied 15 and 18.   
 But they are A very difficult stretch. Double-bogey can jump up and get you there in a heartbeat, so you've got to pay attention and make sure you hit some good shots and stay away from the trouble.   
  
  Q. Were you watching the scoreboard at all today?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised how it was playing out?  
 STEVE STRICKER: No, I was watching Jerry, my buddy, Jerry. We played the last three days together, and he hit it great. In the practice rounds, if I had money to wager, I was going to put some money on him to win the tournament. He hit it great. It was nice to see him continue his form from the practice rounds into the tournament. So it was fun to see.
