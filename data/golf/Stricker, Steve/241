  Q. Tell us about the state of your game.   
 STEVE STRICKER: I feel good. I feel rested and ready and excited to be here.   
 The weather looks good for this week and the course is in great shape after a little bit of rain, so, yeah, excited for the week.   
  
  Q. Does this ever get old?  
 STEVE STRICKER: No, this doesn't get old at all. This Wednesday, playing a little bit, and then coming over here for the par-3 contest is great fun.
