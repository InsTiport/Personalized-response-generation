Q.   Thoughts playing with Tiger again tomorrow, the comfort level? 
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, we are excited to go back at it again and try to win a point.   It's going to be fun.   A lot of excitement and anticipation leading up to the start of the matches, and to get out there in the morning, we are really looking forward to it. 
It's going to be tough playing Poulter and Justin Rose, they are both playing well.   Every match is tough but it's fun to get out there and get going right away in the morning.

Q.   Did you guys practice foursomes during the practice rounds? 
STEVE STRICKER:   We did a little bit today.   We played a few holes of alternateâ€‘shot and tried to get a little feel of it before tomorrow. 

Q.   Finally playing with him, is there a comfort level that reduces pressure, playing in an event like this? 
STEVE STRICKER:   We are friends and we get along with one another and we have a good time with one another.   It's always fun to go out with a friend.   It's a good time and there's a lot of fun, and like I say a lot of pressure to go along with it but we have a good time with it.
