 Q. Were you surprised scores were so low through two rounds?
 STEVE STRICKER: I kind of am. The course is in such great shape, though, I think guys are going to learn how to play it every day, and I think the scores could even get a little bit lower, to tell you the truth.
 The weather is great. The course is in good shape, so I think guys will figure out a way to get it around and play it well. 

 Q. Barclays brings out the best in you. 
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, you're a little apprehensive coming in here not knowing anything about the course. At least we knew what we had at Westchester, but coming to a place like that that you don't know anything about; it's been good, it's a nice place. 

 Q. Strategy for the weekend? 
 STEVE STRICKER: Same as I've been doing last couple of days. Try to get it in the fairway and give myself a put at it. I've been putting well the first couple of days so try to do the same. 

 Q. What's the strongest part of your game this round?
 STEVE STRICKER: Probably just giving myself opportunities. I gave myself quite a few opportunities. I think I only missed four greens. Ended up making some putts. Any time you shoot 7-under -- indiscernible -- holed out on No. 3 for eagle and that jump-started the round.

 Q. You have to feel confident going through the weekend. 
 STEVE STRICKER: It's halfway there and we have a long ways to go and try not to get ahead of myself and put in a good practice session in afternoon and hopefully find a couple of swing thoughts that will last me tomorrow and through Sunday and we'll see what happens.
