  Q. Talk about the conditions out there.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, conditions were very difficult. The first few holes, for us were probably the toughest we had for the 18 holes, and our first four or five holes it was pretty tough. It really started getting a little bit brighter around our 10th, 11th hole, and the rain started letting up a little bit. The wind started dying down a little bit. But yeah, very tough conditions early on.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the 4th hole. Some of the guys were talking about how much the wind -- Tom Watson hit driver-driver. What did you do on 4?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I hit driver, 3-wood, hit my 3-wood left. I actually made a great chip down to about six, seven feet and missed the putt. But it was a hard hole. You know, I got it in the fairway off the tee, which was difficult. But then it just -- it was unreachable. I don't even think if I hit a good 3-wood if I was getting home in two there today.  
  
  Q. Do you still feel like you're in decent position where you can go out tomorrow and put up a good number and have a chance at this?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I need a good number. I'm going to have to have something really low. If I could have made a birdie coming in instead of dropping a shot and getting back to even, that was the goal anyways, and I just didn't do it.
