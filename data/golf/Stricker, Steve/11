Q. So Senior Open champion has got to have a great sound to it.
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it was a -- it was a long week.  A tough day today.  When you go out with that kind of lead, you know, like I said, you have everything to lose kind of thing.  So it was a tough day.  It was tough to try to battle through all the emotions of trying to hold on to win.  And a 3:25 tee-off time, so you've got all this time in the morning to sit around and think about it, which makes for a hard, hard day.
But very rewarding after you do it and get it done.  I played some great golf this week, and today was kind of rely on my short game a little bit.  But I did some good things when I had to.
Q. And in record-tying fashion.  As low as you went with your score, that's pretty impressive.
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it was just a dream week.  I came in here after missing a putt at the Am Fam Championship last week.
