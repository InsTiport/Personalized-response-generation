  Q. Obviously not the result you wanted, it probably just proves how tough match play can be out here and how good the field is?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah. I knew it was going to be tough out here. Every match is tough. We both played really well, we didn't give each other many holes here and there. But he started putting it really good coming in and scared the hole a bunch of times. And obviously made a great putt to end the match.  
  
  Q. Talk about seeing the putt drop, and the first playoff hole of the day?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I hit a pretty good second shot. I thought I had enough club to get over. It plugged in the bunker. A little unfortunate there. But, you know, it was a tough match all the way around. I think the most I was up was two. And it was pretty close all the way around.   
  
  Q. Talk about maybe any other pivotal shots during the round, any other pivotal holes that swung way or another?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Probably him making birdie at 15 there. He made a nice 15, 18-footer for birdie there. And I didn't make my birdie putt. And that got him 1-up at that point. So that was probably the turnaround right there. And me not making birdie there hurt.  
 And then obviously this hole, right here. He made a great putt. If my ball is not plugged it's a fairly simple up-and-down. But it's unfortunate.   
  
  Q. It's match play?  
 STEVE STRICKER: It is.   
  
  Q. Great battle with Ross, I thought he had you closed down at 17 and maybe again at 18. And you forced him to play a little extra golf?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it was a good match all the way around. He hit some great shots coming in there at the stretch. And I was having a hard time getting the ball close.   
 And he started making some putts, too, which always helps. And obviously the putt he made on the extra hole, here, to seal the deal.   
  
  Q. Your lie was just brutal in that bunker, wasn't it?  
 STEVE STRICKER: It was not good. It was just a little speck of white where that ball was there. And I had to kind of wipe some sand away off of it and put the sand back over the top of it. Yeah, it wasn't too good. It was a little unfortunate that I didn't get a clean look at the bunker shot.  
  
  Q. You said yesterday the difference between 1 and 64 is not much?  
 STEVE STRICKER: No. And history is showing in this event. It can happen to anybody. And that's just the nature of this event. And like I said yesterday, it's kind of scary, because you don't know what you're going to run into.   
 You don't know how the guy is going to play. And it forces your hand at times. And it's the difficulty of this match play.  
  
  Q. Phoenix next week or back home?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Back home for a couple of weeks and then Miami.
