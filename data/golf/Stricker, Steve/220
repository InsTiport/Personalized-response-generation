  Q. How do you feel about today?   
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, how about that? Definitely got the better end of the draw today. It was actually very good conditions out there for us, the wind laid right down and the temperature warmed up. It was nice.   
 I feel good about it. It's still a tough challenge, and if you're not in the fairway it becomes very difficult to get it on the green sometimes. So it's a premium driving it in the fairway and being able to get it on the green from there.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, you know, it's been a few years since we've come here. You know, what I really did this year is try to not think about John Deere at all, once I got off that plane. It's been hard, but you know, I have to try to think about what's important here right now and not think about last week too much. But I feel good about last week, and just try to pay attention to what's going on here and try to treat it like last week didn't happen.
