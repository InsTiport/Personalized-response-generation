 Q.   Could you just kind of sum up your day out there?   
STEVE STRICKER:   It was a little scrappy.   It always seemed like I was in the edge of the rough, and then hit a couple wayward drives, hit a bad one on 9 but made a nice up‑and‑down.   But yeah, I always seemed to be‑‑ I didn't hit many fairways today, but I always seemed to be just on the edge, and that makes it tough around here trying to go into the greens out of the rough.   But I managed it well.   I played smartly and got a lot out of it.   
   
 Q.   This is a big stretch, a heavy stretch of events.   Do you pace yourself or do you just go and show up and‑‑ how do you approach that much playing at the end of the year?   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it is.   There is a lot of playing.   You try to pace yourself.   I mean, but you also need to work on your game at times and hit the range and work at it.   You know, we have this two weeks here, and then I'll get away for a week.   And I think this last week, I didn't pick up a club until Sunday actually before coming here, so trying to get away from it a little bit more, just knowing that we've got a big stretch coming.   Yeah, you're right, you've got to kind of pick and choose and do it smartly, I think.  
   
 Q.   Is that a little bit of an endurance test, too?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, for sure.   It gets tiring at the end of the year.   Your legs, everything, mentally, everything, gets a little tired.   It is an endurance test.   I think more mentally than anything, it's fatiguing.   You have a lot of big tournaments and a lot on the line, and that gets to you, too, mentally.   
   
 Q.   You haven't been to Kiawah, right?  
STEVE STRICKER:   I have not.  
   
 Q.   Is part of that the fact that there's just so much traveling already, you're not going to make an extra trip for that?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it's tough for me being in the Midwest and just getting down there.   It's a tough spot to get to in general.   But I figure I still have three days there, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and I'll probably play nine, 18, nine, something like that, and you should get a pretty good handle on it seeing both sides twice.
