   STEVE STRICKER: Obviously anytime you can get a win, get a point, get off to a good start; Tiger and I, and the team we got off to a good start overall. 
 So I think it was a good match, and it's great to be a part of it. The atmosphere here is unbelievable, and you know, pro-Europe, of course but it's still great to be a part of it.

 Q. You've played five times with Tiger in pairs recently and won them all, what's the secret to success?
 STEVE STRICKER: I just think we are very comfortable with one another. We enjoy being out there with one another, even though our games, he hits it a lot further than I do, our games are very similar. We putt well and chip well, and he's a great iron player. 
 So he's always got opportunities. I think the bottom line is, we're just comfortable with one another.
