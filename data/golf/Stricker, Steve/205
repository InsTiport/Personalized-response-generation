  Q. Some thoughts on teaming together and coming away with the victory.   
 MATT KUCHAR: I was awfully excited to get paired with Steve. I was hoping for a pairing like this for a while. We had fun out there and played some good golf. Steve had my back when I was out of holes and it felt like I had his back when he was out of holes. It was a really good tag-team out there.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, we are friends, first of all, so it's fun to go out with a friend, and we get along good. I, too, was looking forward to the pairing, and he hit it right on the head. We had each other's back when the other guy wasn't in the hole, and that's important in the best-ball play.   
 It's tough conditions, too. You've got a 100 yards and in sometimes, and it's difficult just to hit the green. So you have to play hard every shot and play it out. But we had each other's back. It was good.   
  
  Q. How much momentum did you feel coming off of yesterday and getting that halve yesterday?   
 MATT KUCHAR: Such an exciting finish to the day, to be 2-down with two to go and to halve that match felt like a real win for us. I think the whole U.S. was on a bit of a high after that match. I certainly was still on the high coming out today and feeling good about how things finished last night and kept it going today.
