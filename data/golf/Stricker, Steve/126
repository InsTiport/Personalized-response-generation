  STEVE STRICKER:   I thought 10‑under was going to be the number, and just didn't have any firepower today.   Didn't make any putts.   Didn't really have very many opportunities.   Consequently, you know, didn't play very well. 

Q.   Were the greens not that much firm? 
STEVE STRICKER:   I hit a lot of greens, but not real close.   I had a couple opportunities early on that I didn't make.   I had opportunities at 8 and 9.   Didn't make those. 
Just really never got any momentum today.   And really, didn't hit it in the fairway.   Hit it in the fairway the last couple holes, but struggled getting it in the fairway.   A lot of first cuts today. 

Q.   Was the course gettable today? 
STEVE STRICKER:   I think it was, if you were playing well.   It's still one of those things; you still have to hit all the shots.   You have to drive it in play and if you're off a little bit, it's still going to get you.   I think that's why you see a disparity in scores.   In you're playing well, you can definitely shoot a good score here today, and we had perfect weather for it and the course was in great shape. 

Q.   When is your first win of the season coming? 
STEVE STRICKER:   When is it?   Yeah, I don't know.   I'm not playing many more times, so my options are dwindling. 
We'll see what happens the rest of the year. 

Q.   This is your first time here; what do you think of this venue as a major championship host?
STEVE STRICKER:   I think it was great.   Too bad it rained on us the early part of the tournament, otherwise it would have been a different story as far as scoring.   But it was a great venue.   It was a great old‑time course.   No tricks about it.   I thought it was one of the better Majors that I've played in.
