 Q.  How important was it to get that first win for the U.S.? 
 HUNTER MAHAN:  It was huge.  That one on 10 was good, I put the momentum on our side and it was nice to finish with two wins. 

 Q.  The up-and-down -- 
 STEVE STRICKER:  That was my mistake.  I was trying to get it right of the hole and turned it a little bit and didn't hit a very good shot.  I overcooked it and that really was the turning point and Hunter hit a great shot into the green on 16 and I was fortunate enough to make the putt, so we played good coming in when we had to. 
 HUNTER MAHAN:  We had a great match and we both played well.  We had the momentum rolling and fought back ask it was nice to have the lead the whole day and finish the way we did. 

 Q.  Were you nervous on the first tee? 
 HUNTER MAHAN:  I was okay.  Nerves were up-and-down the whole day but I was okay when I rolled the putt in, that helped a lot and through the day just got better and better. 

 Q.  Good to have a guy like Steve to keep everything calm? 
 HUNTER MAHAN:  Absolutely.  He's a perfect complement to me. 
 STEVE STRICKER:  Getting one back at 10 really helped and kind of got the momentum back on our side with two up and 8- to play.  I felt comfortable the way we were playing and giving ourselves opportunity for birdies.  Hunter was rolling the ball great and I think we complemented each other very well today.
