Q. Not quite as electric as Thursday and Friday, but a better round than some of the Saturdays we talked about of late.
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.
Q. Just an assessment of the round today.
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, you know what?  I actually played from tee-to-green better than I did the first two days I thought.  Hit a lot of quality shots.  Just didn't make the putts that I had been making the last couple days.
Really never was in too much trouble.  I think I only missed one green.  Couple times not very close on there.  The pins were a little bit more tucked I thought today.
But tee to green was good.  Couple putts I wish I could have made to soften the blow a little bit.
Q. Finally, as Ryder Cup captain, when you see what Jordan is doing, what Xander is doing, I know you're focusing on your own game, but they've got to creep in your mind a little bit.
STEVE STRICKER:   For sure.  As I'm going around playing with Xander there and watching how good he is hitting it and long he's hitting it.  It's bombing it.  I thought about the Ryder Cup many times out there today, that he'll be a good guy to have on that team.  He's great to be around.
And then to see Jordan play well and seems to be moving in the right direction for him, too.  We'll see tomorrow how he holds up.
But a lot of positives from the guys that are playing well.
