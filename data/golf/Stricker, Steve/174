  STEVE STRICKER:   It was that kind of stuff all day.   Yeah, it was difficult, and then the wind, you know, it wasn't really up that much, but it's out of a different direction and it's cold.   It's out of the north, you know, and it seemed like we always kind of played it into the wind going out and then it kind of turned a little bit, and then we got some holes downwind on the back.   But it was just enough to make it hard.  
   
 Q.   Did you get in any bunkers today?  
STEVE STRICKER:   I was in two bunkers.  
   
 Q.   How were they?  
STEVE STRICKER:   They were fairly dry.   I hit one in the bunker on the No. 3, didn't get it up and down.   And then hit it in the bunker at 6.   Both of them were pretty dry.   I was able to get down and underneath and get them out of there.  
   
 Q.   Were you aware they were small ponds, like 16?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, well, yeah, there were a lot of holes like that.   We saw some right away like at 2 or 3, I can't remember which hole, I think it was 3‑‑ no, it was 2, up by the green.   I don't know which hole, but anyways, a lot of them had water in them.   And we're looking at where would you drop, you know?   And I think that's the difficult part.   I know you've got to take complete relief, but, I mean, do you know if you drop, can you be standing outside the bunker?   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, so sometimes‑‑ yeah, that may be your best option, because we looked at some of them that the drop may be in the bunker, but you may be standing outside the bunker.   I don't know if they do that or not.   But, yeah, it wouldn't be good.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.   I would be up in a tree stand.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, well, you know, if you hit it in the fairway bunkers it doesn't matter, you're just going to chip out.   But I was really trying to stay out of the greenside bunkers today for sure.   The pins were a lot tighter to the edges.   They were in much more difficult spots and you didn't know what‑‑ you never knew what you were going to get up there in the bunker.   So I was just steering away from them.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   No.   No, I mean, but there was a lot of them like that.   There were.   I mean No. 15, you know, it's almost 500 yards and it's sitting basically up on a little deal like this.   If you go past it, it rolls away, and short of it you're putting up the hill.   But a lot of them are like that today, right on a little knob.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about what Brandt is doing out there?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, it's incredible.   6‑under with‑‑ I don't know where he is.   Last time I saw he had a couple to play, which you could birdie one of those coming in.   Those weren't overly difficult, but that's a heck of a round.   I mean, he must be hitting it good and making some putts.   But that's a great round.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.   Well, it was 3‑under and then 4‑under at the turn or it was 4‑under through 8.   4‑under through 9, I think.   Yeah, so we played going out, and I'm like, geez, that's a heck of a score going out in 4‑ or 5‑under, whatever he did there.   So right away, right away I saw him make a couple of birdies within the first, I don't know, four or five holes.   And those were just holes I felt like pars were good and moving on.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
STEVE STRICKER:   No, because, you know what, it was so different from yesterday.   I mean yesterday was pretty fair, benign, you know, you could be aggressive to some of the pins.   It looked like even if you short‑sided some of your shots yesterday, you could get it up‑and‑down.   Today it was not the case at all.   I mean, I'm telling you, every pin was on a little knob.   Maybe they thought they were going to have casual water.   But‑‑ no, I'm kidding.   I'm really kidding.   There's casual in the bunkers, but I don't think they'll have casual on the greens.   But there was that much of a difference.   It wasn't like one or two or three through the course of a round.   I bet if we really go back and look at each pin, there was half of them are up on a little knob.  
   
 Q.   You've got to be happy with your position.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah.   Yeah.   I feel good where I'm at.   I've been playing better over here the last few years.   I think I finished 12th or something last year, and it's been a little more consistent over the last few years.   So I've just kind of got to grind it out and take what it gives you and keep moving on.   
   
 Q.   When you first came over was there a lot of adjustment for you, the logistics?  
STEVE STRICKER:   When is that?   
   
 Q.   When you first came over.   
STEVE STRICKER:   Yeah, you're kind of blown away and you're kind of flustered by it all.   And I still get‑‑ you start looking at the yardage book and you've got pictures and multiple numbers of where you need to go.   You've got to take your time and really figure out where you need to hit it.   Sometimes it doesn't look like you need to hit it there and you actually do.   Just like the last hole here on 18, I mean you've got to kind of challenge that right side but it just doesn't look like you want to try to do it because there's that bunker on the right and there's gourse there.   And if you hit it there you're going to still be in there.   It's a lot of visual things you've got to overcome and be comfortable before you try to hit the shot.   
   
 Q.   Just give me a quick overview of how you played today.   
STEVE STRICKER:   I played all right.   It wasn't as good as yesterday.   I hit a lot of greens, never really had a ton of birdie putts and the pins were in tough spots to try and make putts.   So you had to be aggressive into the green, take some chances or make a lot of long putts, I think.   And scoring was difficult.   It was cold and the ball really wasn't flying like it was yesterday.   And it was a little bit more difficult today.
