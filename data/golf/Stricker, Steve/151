 Q.   (Regarding playing limited schedule).  
STEVE STRICKER:   I'm enjoying it.   I feel good.   I feel rested every time I've been out so far, I'm ready.   My swing feels pretty good.   I still work on it a lot at home when I'm getting ready to come here and play.   You know, I got off to a little bit‑‑ I didn't make any bogeys today, but you know, because I haven't played a lot, which obviously those first few holes are a little bit jittery and not really knowing what to expect, but I got it going right away and hit some good quality shots and gave me some confidence.   
   
 Q.   What will be your next after this?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Houston and then Augusta.   
   
 Q.   What about after that?  
STEVE STRICKER:   Three weeks off and then THE PLAYERS.   
   
 Q.   What was it like having Nicki on the bag?  
STEVE STRICKER:   It was a lot of fun.   We try to do it at least one time a year.   We did it last year at Greenbrier.   It worked out with the kids and everything this week.   We have a lot of fun out there.   She loves being inside the ropes and it's a great group to watch Phil and Bubba go around.   Last year she did it at Greenbrier and we played with Webb and Tiger.   So she's been thrown into the den both times.   So it's been fun.   
   
 Q.   Who came up with that arrangement in the first place?   Whose idea was it?   
STEVE STRICKER:   We did it the first three years on TOUR out here.   I don't know who came up with the idea.   Back when we did it on the mini‑tour, it was probably to save money.   And then I said, you know, since we made it out here on TOUR in '94, it was just keep it the same type situation.   And then once we started having kids, it had to go away just because we couldn't make it work.   
It's fun and it's good to have her out here.
