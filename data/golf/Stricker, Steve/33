Q. Four birdies in the last six holes.  Just what clicked for you there at the end?
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it was a bit of a struggle, this is my first round since the playoffs last year, so on the PGA TOUR, so it was a little bit of a wake up call and struggled early on a little bit.  I had been hitting it fairly well in practice, but it's always different under the gun.  So I scrambled around a little bit and finally made some good shots coming in and had some more opportunities.  Chipped one in at 16 for birdie.  So that was always a good way to finish up on that hole.  So I did some better things coming in.
Q. Nice finishing shot from the bunker, almost holed that one.
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah and my bunker play was pretty good today.  Fortunately I put it in some spots where I could get it up-and-down.  And that wasn't too hard a shot, it was going kind of back up the hill and uphill lie in the bunker.  But it was a good way to end.  Wish I could have got a putt at it, but got a par and got out of there.
Q. Your first start on the PGA TOUR this season, how often will we see you out here?
STEVE STRICKER: Probably like about last year, I'm thinking about that 13 to 15 tournament range and then play a handful on the Champions Tour.  I guess it all depends on where I'm playing well.  If I can get off to a good start out here and play some good golf out here, I'll probably tend to lean more toward playing out here.
