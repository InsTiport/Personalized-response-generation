 Q. Talk about your day's work. You bounced back well. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, yesterday I needed to birdie 18 and I would have had a good chance today. Yeah, that's why I have a top 10 and not winning because I had one bad round in four rounds.

 Q. Talk about next week you're going to a major championship. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Looking forward to next week. I didn't play there the last time I was there, so I'll be out on the course at 7:00 tomorrow morning and checking it out. 

 Q. Well done today. You kind of jump-started things with that eagle. A little different than what was going on yesterday. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, just quickly I was about five shots better in the first two holes than yesterday, so that was a positive note. 

 Q. I do want to ask you about yesterday. That first hole, I know what the shots were, but you took a long time to hit that one that was by the green. What was going on there? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it just kept moving. It was sort of lying down in the grain of the grass and it was sort of slow-motion moving for about two minutes. It was quite weird, never seen anything like it.

 Q. Obviously you didn't dwell on it because you came back in the round yesterday, played well today. This is kind of the story of your season. You get these top 10s and just keep plugging along. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, unfortunately, yeah. That's probably why I'm not winning. I'm having one bad round out of the four rounds. If I could put four rounds together I'd have a chance.

 Q. Talk about Whistling Straits next week. You did play there in '04. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: No, I didn't. I was injured at that time, so I'll get out there first thing tomorrow morning and check it out.

 Q. What do you hear about Whistling Straits and how it sets up for your game?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, it's long from what I understand and lots of bunkers.
