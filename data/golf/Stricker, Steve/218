   STEVE STRICKER: It was very gusty and windy, more so than yesterday. But at times it laid down -- not laid down, but it got a little quieter. The rain fortunately hasn't been too long a rain. They've been little squalls that have been coming through here. It really hasn't been too bad, and you can tell by the scores that guys are dealing with it pretty good.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, that's the nature of this part of the world, I guess. You've just got to ride it out and be patient and do the best you can and grind it out. It's tough. It's tough for everybody.  
  
  Q. Do you know Darren very well?  
 STEVE STRICKER: I don't know him very well.
