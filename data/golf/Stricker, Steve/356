 Q.  What was the key to your round today? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  A lot of good shots.  I drove the ball fairly well, got it on the greens and gave myself a lot of opportunities, made some, left a few out there, but all in all, a good round. 

 Q.  You're the fourth player in the world right now.  With the way you're playing, do you feel like you're still the fourth player in the world? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  I don't pay attention to it.  I don't worry about it.  I try to come to each event and play well and try to keep improving.  I've got areas of my game that I can improve on, and I've just got to keep trying to do that and try to get myself into contention more and see if I can't win again. 

 Q.  Was there a specific key to the round for you?  There are holes where water is in play.  Do you see yourself aiming to edges of greens? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  No doubt about it.  There are some holes out here that the water definitely comes into play, but there's some shots you have to stand in there and try to hit it, too, because there are no bail-outs.  It's just a good course.  You have to be in the fairway, and that's the biggest key around here, is getting the ball in the fairway so you can get it on the greens and attack some of the pins. 

 Q.  Two Open champions, Ogilvy and Tiger.  Do you go a little aggressive or do you stay in Steve Stricker mode? 
 STEVE STRICKER:  I try to continue with my game.  Like today, it could have been easily a 6-, 7-under round, and I need one of those tomorrow.  If I just go out and play my game and give myself some opportunities, hopefully I can make some of the putts that I didn't today.
