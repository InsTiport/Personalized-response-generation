 Q.  What happened on 9 there, the situation?  Something went in your eye or something?  
STEVE STRICKER: Oh, I had a bug fly in my eye on No. 8.  Wasn't bothering me too bad.  It was down in the corner, so my wife got it out for me.   
 Q.  Decent start for you again here on the front nine.  
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah.   
 Q.  Just talk about the differences between the start and the finish here.  
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I played the last six holes rotten; played the first twelve pretty good; 3-under through those with a bogey at No. 9.   
Just hit a couple wayward drives, got in a couple bad positions, and just didn't play that well coming in.   
 Q.  Did you have to make any additional adjustments after all the rain today?  How were the greens playing and even off the drives as well?  
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, you know, it played a lot longer.  Course played a lot longer.  The greens were a little bit slower.  I had a hard time getting the ball to the hole; I've had a hard time getting it to the hole all week.  They've just been a little bit slower than normal.   
But everybody has got to make those adjustments.  Just couple wayward shots and couple of dumb plays led to three bogeys coming in.   
 Q.  Sitting for two and a half hours and have to come back out here; is it tough to get going again?  
STEVE STRICKER: You know, a little bit, but I actually felt like I got a little bit looser the second time than I did right away this morning.   
I was a little stiff and sore this morning for some reason, and when we came back out I was feeling a little bit better.  Warmed up a little bit better and my body felt a little bit better the second time around.   
So wasn't too bad sitting around.  We were able to get something to eat and rest up a little bit.  But it's been a tough walk around here this week.  It's wet, it's hot, and it's been a little bit tougher.   
It's always a tough walk, but this year it just seems a little bit tougher.  I don't know if that's because I'm a year older or if it's just -- it is tougher.   
 Q.  (Regarding gallery after rain delay.)  Pretty good crowd.  
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, you know, they always get a good crowd here.  The community supports this event so much.  It's good to see.   
It's taken a little bit of a hit today as you can tell on 18; not many people here today.  Hopefully tomorrow they'll come out.   
 Q.  How do you assess this week where you are right here?  Obviously I know you probably had higher expectations.  
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, yeah, it's a little disappointing.  I was looking for a 6-, 7-, 8-under round today.  I got off to the start I needed to get off to.  I was 3-under through 8 and then just couldn't get anything going after that.   
I birdied No. 12 to get back to three, and then three-putted 13; so that was kind of a momentum killer.   
And then not birdieing 14, too, really kind of hurts.   
But, yeah, I had a little bit higher expectations.  Maybe tomorrow we'll shoot a good one.
