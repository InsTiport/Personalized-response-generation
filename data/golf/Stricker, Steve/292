   STEVE STRICKER: It was fun to shoot the score that I did, but the conditions were not fun at all. I just stayed patient. I did a lot of good things, hit the ball close a couple times, and my short game was strong, you know, when I did miss the greens. Overall it was a good day.  
  
  Q. Were you surprised at how well you played in this?  
 STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, I am a little bit, but once -- I think the key to the round was chipping in on 18 for birdie and making the turn at 2-under and then birdieing No. 1. That little couple-hole stretch there kind of got me going. From there I just felt like I was a little bit on a roll and felt like if I missed the green I'd get it up-and-down. I gave myself a couple birdie opportunities and made them, and just a lot of things went my way today.  
  
  Q. When that happens is it hard (indiscernible.)  
 STEVE STRICKER: If it's dry. Hopefully tomorrow the rain lets up a little bit and we get some better conditions. I'm just looking forward to getting dry and heading back to the hotel room.
