  Q. Good, solid start or not very happy?   
 STEVE STRICKER: A little of both I'd say. I do some dumb things around here, I know that. But you know, I managed to right the ship, I think, and get a round in that really didn't hurt me terribly. Not the start that I was really looking for, I guess, but still got an opportunity to come back tomorrow morning. We're out in the morning, and hopefully I can post a good score tomorrow morning.   
  
  Q. When Luke birdied 15 -- or eagled, and you birdied, Freddie said something and you laughed.   
 STEVE STRICKER: Well, I said, "Thanks for the read." I can't remember what he said back, because he was on the same line as I was down there. But he played great. It was fun playing with him today. And Luke and I just kind of hung in there, and it was fun. Perfect day. Perfect day to play.   
  
  Q. A lot of guys were saying that it was pretty scorable today, a good time to get at it when the weather was good?  
 STEVE STRICKER: It was. Very light wind, and the greens were fairly soft still and smooth. They were a little quicker today -- I think that's always the scary part going around here is they pick up speed from Wednesday to Thursday, and you know, you're always kind of adjusting on the speed and not quite sure of the speed at times. That makes things difficult, even on ten-footers, because you've been practicing one speed and it's a little bit different today. So that's always a challenge here.
