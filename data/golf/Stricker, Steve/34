 Q.  Nice round.  Get some comments if we can.  
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, it's a course where we start on the back, we had to take advantage of it early because there's some par-5s that played downwind.  We could reach them, other years we haven't been able to reach them.  The course played a little bit faster.  The greens were tough to putt though, a little bouncy, a lot of footprints, they're a little softer at times, firm at times, so it was a tough to gauge some of the putts and chips, but I'm extremely happy with what happened, I just made a bomb on the last hole to kind of steal one there, but a good solid round.   
 Q.  Speaking of that front nine, No. 16, your 7 the hole.  You did eagle that one.  Take us through that.  
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, hit a driver and had just a couple hundred yards left to the hole and hit a nice soft little 4-iron in there to about probably about 12 feet and then snuck it in there.   
 Q.  Heading to Pebble tomorrow, you're 9-under, in contention, so looking forward to a good day tomorrow?  
STEVE STRICKER: Yeah, yeah, good day.  Pebble's in great shape and I understand the wind is supposed to blow a little bit tomorrow, so it will be a little bit more difficult, I think, but yeah, I'm excited about the position I'm in and just got to keep it going.
