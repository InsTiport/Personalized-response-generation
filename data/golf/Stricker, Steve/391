  Q.  Steve, talk about your round and what was going right for you.   
 STEVE STRICKER:  I just played fairly consistent, I drove it in the fairway a lot and got it on the greens.  I tried to bring the same mentality here as would I a U.S. Open, just try to get it in the fairway and knock it on the greens and that's what I was doing today and made a couple of putts coming in.   
  
  Q.  Sounds like keeping it in the fairway is key.  Can you talk about how the course has been playing?   
 STEVE STRICKER:  The fairway is of the utmost importance trying to get it in there.  Just, you know, amongst our group today, if we hit it in the rough, we were just hacking it out short of the green and trying to get it up-and-down.  There wasn't -- maybe Janzen got it to the green one time out of the rough, but for the most part, you're just hacking it out and just trying to get it up-and-down within a hundred yards.   
  
  Q.  Anything you're looking to improve over the weekend?   
 STEVE STRICKER:  Just looking to do the same thing for three more days, and I will be in good shape.   
 It's going to get tougher and I'm sure it's going to firm up a little bit once this rain gets out of here, but just keep trying to do the same thing, hit it in the fairway.
