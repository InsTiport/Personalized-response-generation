 Q.  Great round.  
LEE HODGES: Thank you.   
 Q.  What was right about it?  
LEE HODGES: Hit it in the right spots.  Just played pretty smart.  The short game was really good.  Got up and down some key times.   
Just played really well.   
 Q.  Now that it looks like you're safe with match play, got to a big sigh of relief for you?  
LEE HODGES: Yeah, it's cool, it's cool.  This is only my second Am.  Last year I missed match play by a stroke.   
So it's fun.  It'll be a cool experience.   
 Q.  What's your mindset now?  
LEE HODGES: Just play, you know.  I'm playing really well so I don't want to change too much, to be honest.   
 Q.  What's the strength of your game when you're playing well?  
LEE HODGES: I'm usually a pretty good ball-striker.  My putter has let me down in the past, but not this week so far.   
We'll see.  Hopefully it keeps up.   
 Q.  Do you like the fact that Riviera is going to be match play course?  
LEE HODGES: I do, yeah, yeah.  It's great course.  There are a lot of birdies, but you have to hit it well.  They don't just give you birdies, but you can make them.
