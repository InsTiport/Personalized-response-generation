 Q.   So back to another good score?  
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Yeah, it was a bit of a mix today.   The long game felt a bit better, but unfortunately I hit a few bad shots here and there, but I got a way with most of them, and putting was still as good as the first day I'd say, so good score, 66.   
   
 Q.   Is it an easier course?  
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Yeah, a lot easier than Carnoustie of course.   Carnoustie is quite tough I must say.   But still, I mean, it felt like there was a little bit more wind today than there was yesterday, so that kind of made it a little bit tougher as well.   
   
 Q.   Going back to a course tomorrow where you had a really good score‑‑  
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Yeah, I like playing at the Old Course, and of course shot a good score there on Thursday.   Looking forward to it.   
   
 Q.   A bit of a battle maybe with your fellow country man?   
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Yeah, could be a bit of a battle with him.   
   
 Q.   And Grace a bit ahead?  
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Yeah, so we need to help each other out I guess to try to chase him down.
