Q.   Your thoughts on shooting this lovely score to move up the board once again? 
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Long game wasn't really there today, but the putter was fantastic.   Putting, I'm not sure I've ever putted as good, apart from the 3‑putt unfortunately on 16, but it's been really good.

Q.   That's saying something.   We've seen you putt superbly well down the years, so what is it about this day?
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   I have every now and then, and I've just gone back to my old putter again, my old trusty and that's probably at least one part of it. 
I changed putters probably around this time last year, maybe later, and putted really nice with that putter, and that's probably the reason why the putter wasn't there the beginning of the year, I didn't want to change back again, because I knew there was good putting in that one, as well. 
But now when I have this five‑week break, I decided I wanted to come back to the old one and it feels good.

Q.   How much is down to the putter, how much is down to technique and how much is down to what's between the ears? 
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Well, it's probably 99 per cent between the ears, at least it felt like that today.   I could see the lines quite easily and then it was just to go up and do it and trust it.

Q.   Are you conscious of leaderboards?   You presumably are, knowing that you're well in touch?
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   I am.   I look at leaderboards and I was actually thinking before today, that I might not look at leaderboards in the beginning of the round, but after the 3‑3 start, I couldn't help myself.   I had to have a look.
