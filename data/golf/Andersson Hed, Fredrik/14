  Q.  Another good performance out there?   
 FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:  Yes very good, I started off very nicely and then I also had a stretch of four in a row on the back  nine which was good. I played solidly and putted well, I had no real faults today.   
  
  Q. Top 20 in your last four events is very consistent form, what do you put that down to, confidence?   
 FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:  Yes, of course playing well gives you that extra bit of confidence and makes you want to do even better the next time you go out so I think I am riding on that at the moment, definitely.   
  
  Q. The next step will be the winners' circle?   
 FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:  Yes, and hopefully that will be tomorrow but we will see. The leaders have almost 18 holes to play out there so I think they will get away from me a little bit out there and I will probably end up needing something similar tomorrow to have a realistic chance.   
  
  Q. How far do you think you will be behind come the end of play?   
 FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED: I would assume someone will go to 17 or 18 under par so I reckon I'll be four or five behind.   
  
  Q. You are already on course for your best finish on the Order of Merit; that must please you?   
 FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED: Of course it does. I have been playing solidly all year even though there were a couple of weeks in the middle of the season which were so-so but still not very bad.   
But I had a good start to the year and I have also had a few good weeks recently as you mentioned earlier. I am going to take next week off and then play the Volvo Masters.
