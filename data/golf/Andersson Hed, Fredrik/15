   FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:  I got off to a good start with a birdie on the second but then dropped shots at the third and fourth. The one on the third was especially poor with just a gap wedge in. Then I got a birdie on 7 to get back to level par for the day and played well on the back nine with the eagle on the 17th.   
  
  Q.  It has been a good season but how do you cope with the final day?   
 FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:  I probably won't look at the boards too much but just try and enjoy and see what happens.   
  
  Q.  How did you keep your cool after those two early bogeys?   
 FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:  I was frustrated with that bogey on the third and three putted. But got a great putt in for par on the fifth and the birdie on seven got me back on level terms.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel the benefit of being there before?   
 FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:  It is starting to feel better and I am getting more used to it. I will probably be a little tense tomorrow at the start but hopefully it will ease as the round goes on and I enjoy it. It is nice to have some Swedes up there and could be fun tomorrow.
