 Q.   Tell us about last week and also about the situation‑‑  
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   The thing was, I smashed a club in the ground on the 11th hole, which was Saturday evening.   Didn't really think much more about it.   And the day after I used a couple of times and then all of a sudden it hit me that it was the club that I smashed in the ground and I looked at it and it was a tiny, tiny dent and then out of play and an instant qualification.   
I had a discussion with Andy McFee, because I said you can't really know when it happens, if it happened when I smashed it in the ground or two weeks ago or two months ago.   But he said if it is bent, if it looks a bit funny, then we are going to have to give the benefit of the doubt.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the first round here in Hong Kong, solid start, 4‑under par, seems difficult to keep bogeys off the card?  
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   It is.   It's really tricky.   Because of the wind, especially, since it's in the trees, it's really tough to feel where the wind really is.   And then of course, the greens are quite fast and slopey and thick rough around the greens.   
   
 Q.   Enjoying your game and looking forward to going out tomorrow?  
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   I can't say I played fantastic today but I had a really hot putter today, so that gave me a good score today.  
   
 Q.   What do you think of this old‑style course?  
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   I like it.   I like it.   Doesn't have to be a long par 3 to be a good par 3 or a tricky par 3.   I like it.   It makes it difficult with the wind, but I managed to get it around.   
I don't know what it's like, if it normally picks up in the afternoons.
