Q.   Great position to be in right at the top of the leaderboard?
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Absolutely.   Good score yesterday.   Decent score today I would say.   It felt like I left a few out there but on the other hand I was quite lucky on a few occasions, as well.   So I'm happy with the 71. 

Q.   So Kingsbarns to play tomorrow, which is regarded as the easiest of the three courses‑‑
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   I think Kingsbarns and St. Andrews are quite equal, at least in this kind of weather.   Then I'm not sure what happens if it starts blowing a bit harder which it's supposed to tomorrow. 

Q.   And the guys at the top have to come here, so anything can happen?
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Of course.   I'm not sure, all of them are at St. Andrews, so might stop them a little bit from making too many birdies.
