Q.   How good is 3‑under?   You're the best of the afternoon. 
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   I played really solid today.   It's a tough course if you miss it on the wrong place.   But on the other hand, I played really solid with the irons especially today, and then you get quite a few short wedges into the greens and you get quite a few birdie chances. 

Q.   What makes the course so difficult? 
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   It's the speed and the firmness of the greens.   If you miss it on the wrong side, you're dead.   You're happy to get it within 20 feet if you miss it on the wrong side. 
I played well, holed a few, and missed a few as well, I guess. 

Q.   How do you consider this tournament, given your precarious position?   Are you quite relaxed? 
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Well, I felt pretty relaxed out on the course today but it's easy to be when you're playing well I guess.   But of course, if I'm in contention coming into Sunday, of course I will be a bit nervous.

Q.   I guess in the early stages, you just have to go with it. 
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Yeah, it's three days to go.   But I hope I can play as I did today and put as I did.

Q.   We've been speaking in recent weeks and your game is in good shape, isn't it? 
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   It has been good over the last couple of months and been almost injury‑free, as well.   That helps, as well.

Q.   And you're in tune with time zones; the travelling has not been too arduous? 
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   No, it has not been too bad.   I didn't sleep great this night, but still, I managed to get quite a few hours.   It hasn't been too bad.
