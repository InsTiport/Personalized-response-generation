  FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   I hit a perfect drive.   I was still debating for a little while if I was going to hit driver or not, and just hit the perfect shot straight at the pin.   Not sure if it rolled up the bank and back down again but if it didn't, it must have been close to going in.  
I was struggling a bit to get the feel for the greens on the front nine.   I thought I had quite a few chances but I didn't get them in.   Then hit a couple of bad shots, 11 and 12, so loosened my temper a little bit and then I chipped in on 12 which was the turnaround and the good save on 13 and the eagle on 14.   It was a nice run of a few holes.  
   
 Q.   I take it these were tricky conditions to play in, but made the greens more receptive.   
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   The greens are softer overall, even when we started before, it was raining during the round but I guess there has been some rain as well.   It's tricky with the wind of course, and the rain.   
   
 Q.   After a quiet second day, nicely back in it.   
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Yeah, absolutely, in with a chance to start to keep my card and hopefully as well win the tournament.  
   
 Q.   You're smiling; does the pressure build from here, though?   
FREDRIK ANDERSSON HED:   Of course there will be some pressure tomorrow.   I mean, there always is pressure when you're in contention, and this situation is a bit special of course, with trying to keep my heart and everything.   So there will be pressure tomorrow, for sure.   So just accepting it and trying to live with it.
