 Q.  How did you find it out there today? 
 LONNIE NIELSEN:  Well, I don't think that there's an inch of my body that's not covered in sand.  It was really blowing out there.  And you get a little break in the middle of the round and then you have nine holes in a row downwind and then hang on to your hat coming in. 
 Those last five holes are killer.  I played them 1-over and I'm thrilled with playing the last five 1-over.  They're really tough. 

 Q.  Do you think it made any difference your tee time you had today? 
 LONNIE NIELSEN:  Well, I understand that it was calmer this morning, but by the time I got out, I'm sure even the early groups played nine holes in the wind.  So it all evens out.  We'll get it in the morning tomorrow and obviously they will have to play in the afternoon.  About you -- obviously it would be better not to play when the wind is blowing like this.  But they gave us a break the last few holes there, the last five there coming in.  I think they moved us up on four of those five holes substantially, maybe 30, 40, 50 yards.  But it at least gave us a fighting chance to make a par. 

 Q.  And if there's one thing that you learned today that you need for tomorrow? 
 LONNIE NIELSEN:  Patience, I guess.  Yeah.  You got to have a lot of patience.  You're going to get in trouble and you got to take your lumps and get it back or you can make a double or triple or worse here so fast.  So you're going to hit some bad shots and then take your lumps and try and make a bogey and move on.
