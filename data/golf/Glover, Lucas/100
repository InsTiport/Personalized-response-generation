  Q. You shot a 65, you made it look pretty easy?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I played well. Six holes to get started there, maybe a little bit of a hangover. But hit a close one on 7. Kind of got things kick started. Kind of a brain fart on 10. That was the only blemish today.   
  
  Q. I didn't know you were a surfer. Kind of riding the wave.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, absolutely. That's a good way to put it, too. Obviously, got a lot of confidence. When you do, you've just got to take it and ride it and just go. And that was today.   
 It took me a few holes to get geared up. When I did, I started playing well.   
  
  Q. After Monday afternoon, all the stuff that's been going on, as a matter of fact shall a little pie in the face yesterday. How you feeling?   
 LUCAS GLOVER: I feel good. I feel good. Mentally, a little more tired than physically. You know, that's hard to judge until you actually play when it matters and keep the score.   
 But I was pleased with myself today. Just misread the speed on one birdie putt and three-putted. That was my only mistake. Hit a lot of fairways and hit a lot of greens. I was pretty happy.   
  
  Q. Did the pie surprise you?   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Oh, yeah, that hurt, too. That wasn't a pie, it was shaving cream. But that was great. It was hilarious. It was probably the funniest thing I've ever witnessed. Unfortunately it was on me.   
 But it was fun. It was great. He deserves kudos for that one.
