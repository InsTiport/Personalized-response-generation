 Q.  4-under, nice start.  If we can get some comments on your day.  
LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, it was good.  I got off to a good start with the putter and just played solid there until the last -- hit a couple foul balls coming in, but such is life.   
 Q.  That last putt will likely stick with you for a minute, missing an eight-footer, but for the most part, putting was solid.  What did you make of the reception of the greens?  
LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, the last hole was a mystery.  I hit my line, I just misread it.  That whole green is kind of back to front, and it went kind of up the hill.  Kind of surprising.  But when I looked up, it was rolling on my line, so that's all you can do.  I'm not going to fret about it.  4-under around here, I'll take it.   
 Q.  You've had a succession of good performances this year.  Have you found something maybe during the off-season that's led to this?  
LUCAS GLOVER: Just knowing what I'm working on is the right stuff, and saw some success, and just continuing to try to get better without reading into anything.  Been dedicated in the gym a little more, and just trying to play good golf and realize I'm pretty good and just try to get better but do it the right way and not make a bunch of changes that are knee-jerk, for lack of a better term.   
 Q.  What was your overall takeaway from the resurfaced greens?  
LUCAS GLOVER: Oh, they're good.  They're good.  Any new greens, what were they, sprigged in September I think I heard?  For that, they're amazing.  We knew coming in they were going to be firm, and that's the way it is with new greens.  But they rolled great, so no complaints.
