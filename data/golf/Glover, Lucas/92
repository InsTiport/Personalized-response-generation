 Q. You played this afternoon, shot 1-under par, talk about the start, how difficult it was. 
 LUCAS GLOVER: It was tough right out of the chute on 1, 490 into the wind. Birdie, birdie, bogey. Roller coaster. But pretty solid. Just the speed of the greens, I wasn't real good. But I made some putts coming in. 1-under for the afternoon, a little breeze, not too upset about it.

 Q. Playing the practice rounds here, did you like the golf course before it started?
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah. I thought the greens were kind of a touch slower. I think it was because of how late we finished. But the golf course suits me. It's long and you gotta drive it good. And I've been doing that this year. I played some of my best golf on some of the hardest courses on the TOUR. Fortunate about that. 

 Q. The bad thing about this round was your finish. Tell us about your finish coming in the last four holes. 
 LUCAS GLOVER: 3-iron and a wedge on 14. I think shortest par 4 on the course. I had a nice putt there. I felt like a pin out there 3-footer on the front fringe. Hit it close on 16 and edge on 18. I'd like to have that one for dinner. But good finish. That will make things a little better for tomorrow. A little momentum going into tomorrow.
