  Q. I know you're not happy about 8, but all in all, a pretty exciting day for you out there.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I played well. I got off to a hot start and just burned the edges a bunch on the front. I hit a lot of good putts. Just that hiccup on 8. I did all my bad work on the same hole and made 5 on one of the easiest holes out there. But not upset with 4-under around here. I could have gotten a few more and done a little better on 8. But all in all, pretty happy. Played well.  
  
  Q. Pretty sporty way to finish the back nine, which was your front nine, with four straight birdies?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, just had a couple of tap-ins, 16 and 17, and then made a couple 15 footers on 15 and 18. Been putting well all week, just didn't hit it close enough on the front to get anything else going there.   
 But again, 66 around here with a little breeze and trying to scratch my way into contention, I'm pretty happy.  
  
  Q. Pretty special, you're walking around, a huge gallery. This is a massive gallery for a Friday, and a lot of folks were yelling at you out there. That has to make you feel great.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, they've been urging me on for a couple weeks now, ever since the Open. Pretty happy about that. It's fun. It's a lot of fun.  
  
  Q. Followed you guys all day, and you talked to Tiger a lot throughout the round. Obviously you guys are friends. Are you asking him for help? Are you picking his brain?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: No, not too much. That's probably for off the course with him. He's so focused on his game. But he likes to cut up and tell stories and jokes and whatnot. But I'll get it out of him later.
