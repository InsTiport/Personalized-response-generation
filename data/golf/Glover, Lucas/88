 Q. You got it to 6-under. You were right there and then what happened?
 LUCAS GLOVER: Well, hit some loose shots and the putter gave out of gas on me. I had four good putts added on 11 through 13 -- 11 through 14. So all for birdie except for 12. And a couple misreads and a couple of bad strokes and next thing you know, I walked away from those holes one over instead of a couple under. Played all right. Not too upset with everything. Wished I could have holed a couple more putts.

 Q. Are you starting to feel a little more comfortable on this stage?
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yes. I played some of my best golf on harder golf courses this year. Look at Torrey and Quail and obviously Bethpage and here at Hazeltine, I've been driving it good all year. And other than today I've been making good putts. But just one of those things. The lid didn't come off as they like to say. I'm not too unhappy with a couple under on this course today.
