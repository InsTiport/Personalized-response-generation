 Q.  You've got to be feeling good about a solid week, top-five finish.  You played solid all week, and if I counted, it looked like you just missed 12 greens in regulation all week.  
LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, ball-striking was there.  I could have hit it in the fairway a little more today to give myself some more birdie chances, but overall, good week.  I've got to make some more six- to ten-footers, but that's practicable and fixable.  Good week, solid week, foundation for '16-'17, and keep it going.
