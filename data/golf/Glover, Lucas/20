Q. Lucas, talk about a solid day, five birdies, no bogies.  You have to be happy with that.
LUCAS GLOVER: Got off to a good day.  Birdied the the first couple.  I hit a whole a bunch on the front.  Could have been real good but just didn't want to go in and then played real solid on the back.
Felt like I birdied a couple of holes I was supposed to and it was good, you know, just couple -- always a couple you want the take back.  7-iron in the par 5 on the front and made par.  Pretty bad wedge on 18.  Got something to work on this afternoon anyway.
Q. How were course conditions?  Was it pretty dry out there?
LUCAS GLOVER: Pretty good.  Fairways were getting there.  Let's put it that way.  They were getting there.  Lot dryer than yesterday.  Greens were absolutely perfect.  I mean perfect.  They were firm with long irons, receptive with everything else and absolutely rolling great.  Good job here as always.
Q. How good is the game right now.  You've really had a good year.  54th in FedExCup Points.  I know you've been working hard.
How would you characterize this season so far?
LUCAS GLOVER: It's good.  I have to put four together.  That's kind of been the deal.  I played in my Top 10s or 20s it's been three real good rounds and one average one.  Doesn't take four real good ones but it takes four solid ones.  I've been missing that.  Each day is a new day and just aggressive, smart and just try to put four together and we see how we stack up.
