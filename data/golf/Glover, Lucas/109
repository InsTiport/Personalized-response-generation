 Q. Lucas, 3-under par 69 on an interesting day where it was kind of nice when you came into 18 and didn't have a jacket on and came back here and put on the jacket because it's cold. 
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, it's been up-and-down all day. Luckily the weather has been better than the forecast, so we've been lucky the last two days.

 Q. 3 for 3 in sand saves today. How important is it to try to keep that round going, especially on a course like this?
 LUCAS GLOVER: It was good. Short game was important today. I didn't hit it like I'm used to, to be honest with you. I missed a lot of greens. But I never was short-sided except for 17, my only bogey of the day. But my bunker game was good, I hit some good flop shots and I hit some key four- and five-footers but didn't get it done coming down the stretch, 16, 17 and 18, but pretty happy.

 Q. 18 in terms of greens in regulation, it wasn't great, but you didn't let it get away?
 LUCAS GLOVER: Right. It just seemed like all the greens that you felt like you had to hit I missed, like 11 and 12, 4- and 5-irons, I just wasn't judging the wind quite right and wasn't starting the ball where I needed to. On a day like this it's all right, I guess.

 Q. It's a good score in these conditions, and hopefully the weather is supposed to improve for tomorrow. Do you try to build on the momentum that you got today just by staying in it?
 LUCAS GLOVER: You know, I wish it was awful to be honest with you. It looks like Johnny has got a pretty good lead going, so we might need some weather to catch him. But we'll see. That's all we can do.
