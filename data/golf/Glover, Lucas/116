 Q.  How did you enjoy the format? 
 LUCAS GLOVER:  Yeah, it's good.  I've got a good partner, and we knew coming in we wanted to play together, and we've done well together. 

 Q.  What was it like playing with Canada's favorite son, with as it more difficult or more interesting? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  It made it more fun to be honest with you.  I was hoping I would get a chance to play against him because the crowds would be very boisterous and supportive of him and they have come out and it's been great. 

 Q.  What was your first thought when you saw you had drawn Vijay Singh and Mike Weir? 
 SCOTT VERPLANK:  Well, you know they are going to be tough and they are both going to play hard.  I was looking forward to a chance to play with Mike because I knew the crowd would be so good and really supportive of him. 
 I have great memories of this golf course, so I've had plenty of Canadian support as well, so it's been nice. 

 Q.  You wanted so much to make this team, what has the experience been like compared to what you expected? 
 LUCAS GLOVER:  It's been great and guys like Scott make it more fun.  Just get me going and get me into my game, and it's been a great week.
