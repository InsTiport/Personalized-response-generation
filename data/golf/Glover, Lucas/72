  Q. Take your lumps and come back?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: Absolutely. Absolutely. Pretty poor three-putt on 1 and then a bad bunker shot on 2. Giving two shots away early.  
  I've been there before. I did it last year. I just have to remind myself to stay patient and do the right thing and just fight it out.  
    
  Q. How much different was it to walk here as the defending champion under these conditions?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: It was nice going on the first fee, but everybody forgets that after that. Everybody wants that trophy, here. There's 156 guys that want it and I happen to be one of them. So that was the mindset.
