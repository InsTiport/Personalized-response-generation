Q. Great start here.  Seven birdies, a bogey, 6-under 66.  Thoughts on how you played today.  Including that stretch of four birdies in a row starting at 4?
LUCAS GLOVER: I played the par-5s well.  Four birdies on the fives.  None of them were difficult.  So I think that's a good formula.  But I played well.  I could have hit it a little closer and should have got some more putts to the hole because I was seeing the line real well today.  But can't complain with 66.  Go to the Stadium Course tomorrow and see if we can make some more birdies.
Q. You played in this tournament a number of times, what did you think when you found out that the Stadium Course and the Nicklaus Tournament Course was going to be played?
LUCAS GLOVER: Still fun.  Still golf.  I had some experience here years ago, a couple Q-Schools around here.  But they're fine courses.  They're in fine shape, greens are firm and fast and fairways are perfect.  So, no excuses.  Just got to hit good shots and make some putts.
Q. Ninth couple of weeks ago, 17th to start the new season at Fridays.  A lot of good things going on with your game right now.
LUCAS GLOVER: I think so.  Getting a little confidence with the putter.  Struggling with ball striking a little bit last week, but remedied that some today.  But happy with what I'm seeing.
Q. Must be the Clemson Tiger mojo.  The football team plays for the National Championship, the basketball team's playing really well, you just got to keep it going on the golf course.
LUCAS GLOVER: That's right.  They're setting a pretty high standard for us.  But it was a heck of a run and Coach Brownell has the hoops team heading the right direction and Dabo does what Dabo does.  He has a bunch of good kids coming in and we'll see if we can't keep winning some games.
