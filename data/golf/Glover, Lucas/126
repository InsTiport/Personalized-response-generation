 Q.  On the course. 

 LUCAS GLOVER:  The golf course is winning again.  Today was a day of survival.  I got a little unlucky on number 15.  I caught a gust and got unlucky with the wind.  Except for that one, it was pretty much my fault.  I just didn't make anything.  Didn't make a big putt. 

 I didn't putt that bad, the greens are just tough.  I didn't execute when I had to, I made a couple of mental mistakes, and was unlucky a time or two.
