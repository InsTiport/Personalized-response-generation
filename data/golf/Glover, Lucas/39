  LUCAS GLOVER:   Had a couple hiccups there in the middle of our first nine, but bounced back and some birdies around the turn, and had some opportunities coming in, just didn't cash in on any.   But happy with the way I played. 

Q.   Where is the game right now?   It's great to see you playing well.   Where are you right now? 
LUCAS GLOVER:   Improving is what I would say.   I finally broke through, made a good round on Friday at Sea Island and made the cut there, and nice to come here and play well and get to play the weekend.   Just going to keep working on what I'm working on.   I know it's right, and just believe in that, and hopefully we can get where we need to be.

Q.   The cold weather doesn't seem to be bothering you.   You've got a stocking cap on.   A little brisk out there, though, wasn't it?
LUCAS GLOVER:   Well, I was going to take it off, but I started making some putts.   I might play with this thing in June.   (Laughter.)
I've not been a very good cold weather player in the past, so it was nice to get out and birdie the first three, and that kind of warmed me up pretty quick.   The golf course is in such good shape.   It's such a good course.   It was a good day.   I had a great group with David and Padraig, and we all played well.
