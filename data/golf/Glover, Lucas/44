Q.   A long day, a lot of starts and stops.   I know you're a rhythm guy.   Was it just one of those where it was difficult to get one going? 
LUCAS GLOVER:   I didn't do myself any favors early when we were playing.   I just didn't hit it close enough to make any birdies.   Those guys got off like wildfire early.   I wasn't hitting it close enough to catch up.   Only 3â€‘under on the weekend isn't going to do it when there are birdies flying like they were this week.   So lot of positives, and I'll go on to next week to see what happens.
