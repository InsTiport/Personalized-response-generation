 Q. 4-under, one off the lead. Talk about your round. How is it setting up for tomorrow?
 LUCAS GLOVER: It's good to come out and have fun and relax before tomorrow. I hit some good shots and let the kids have some fun on 8. So we all had a good time.

 Q. Is there anything that you can take from today?
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I made some putts. And any time you see putts go in it doesn't hurt your confidence. 
 My stroke feels good and I read some right and it never hurts your feelings to knock in some putts.
