   LUCAS GLOVER: After hitting it in the water, and I think that kind of got things going a little bit. A good par like that almost feels like a birdie. 
 Birdied 17 and 18 and then made the turn with a little momentum, so I played really well on the front, other than a couple bad drives that cost me maybe two shots. Could have got to six today and had to hit a 6-iron in from my third and hit it in the hay on three and made bogey. 
 But I played well, I putted really well. I gotta hit some more fairways tomorrow if I'm going to be able to go low enough to scare anybody. 
 So that's the mindset the rest of the day is figure the driver out a little bit. Just getting a little off line early, and we gotta fix that. But all in all pretty pleased.

 Q. Are you feeling any sort of fatigue at all from last week, the appearances you've made and all that kind of stuff?
 LUCAS GLOVER: Physically I'm fine. Mentally I'm still a little out of it, but you know, I played two pretty good rounds. So it must not be as bad as I'm feeling. 
 But you know, yesterday might have been just a cramp day or something, but there's always tomorrow, and we'll see how many birdies we can make.
