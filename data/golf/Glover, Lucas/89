 Q. You battled it today. 
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, it wasn't all there today, but not too unhappy with 1-under. I feel like I left a few out there with my putter, but you know, played all right and still right there. So you know, something crazy tomorrow, you never know. 

 Q. You hit your driver beautifully again, only two missed fairways. 
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I've been driving it good. I've been doing that all year, to be honest with you. That's why I've been playing well on some difficult golf courses. I've been driving it good and making a lot of my short putts. When you do that on a hard course, you're going to do all right. 

 Q. Four back going into the final round of Tiger. 
 LUCAS GLOVER: We all know how Tiger is the last round, so it's going to take something crazy, but you know, I made a bunch of birdies this week. I just need to putt a bunch together in one round.
