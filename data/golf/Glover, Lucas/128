  Q.  Talk about your round today.   

 LUCAS GLOVER:  It was yeah, I can't, it was a good break on No. 1.  Somehow I got lucky there.  I'm not happy, but not upset either (with my round).   

 On No. 11 I got what I deserved.  (Hit a bad drive there).   

 But I got one back on number 13.  (That was a good hole to me.)   

Tomorrow the goal is the same, just don't do anything dumb.  I did on No. 11 today, but like I said, it could have been worse.   

 I'd have to say the knees were still a little wobbly on No. 1.  I was a little more comfortable than last year, but it was still the first hole of the first Major of the year.
