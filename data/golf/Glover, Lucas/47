Q.   Nine birdies in the opening round for Lucas Glover.   How does it feel on a course with soft, wet ball in hand to make sure you get the most out of this one? 
LUCAS GLOVER:   Yeah, it was good.   Any time you can climb up the board in the afternoon, it feels pretty good.   I hit it like I've been hitting it and finally putted well.   I made a lot, made the short ones, and it was good.

Q.   In the bigger picture, things coming back to form for you in 2013.   What can a round like this do as you continue to move forward? 
LUCAS GLOVER:   Honestly, I can't tell you how happy I am to make all my short putts for one round.   I haven't done it all year.   I've been struggling with it, and I've been working.   It paid off today.   It might be different tomorrow, but right now I'm going to enjoy it, because it was great to have some confidence and walk into those knowing I was going to make them, and I did.

Q.   How much does confidence mean to you and anyone out here?   As you said, you've put in the work but haven't seen the results.   Now potentially it can continue. 
LUCAS GLOVER:   Yeah, it's easy to tell yourself to be positive and confident.   But until you see some go in, it's virtually impossible.   But start every round that way and hope you finish that way, and today we did. 
Coop, did a great job in the wind, and we had some tough wind coming in, and he did great, and put me in good on spots and luckily I rolled some in.
