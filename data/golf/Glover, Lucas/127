  Q.  Talk about your round?   

 LUCAS GLOVER:  I played well today.  I just short sided myself twice.  I took advantage of what I could.  I lagged it well because it's hard to get the ball close.   
  
  Q.  Regarding his double bogey at number 7.   

 LUCAS GLOVER:  You just have to let it go.  As you know how hard it is playing.  I think what I did on 8 (made a birdie) was the answer.  I was proud of myself for coming back.   

 I drove it right and tried to cut it, but fell short.  I then bit off a bit more than I could chew.  Instead of going for a 20 footer, I hit it over the green and then missed a 15 footer.   

 I hope I'm in it.  Zach is playing well.  You keep improving every day, that's a good thing.   
  
  Q.  Regarding putting.   

 LUCAS GLOVER:  I was short all day.  I know how fast they are.  Maybe I'm scared a bit.  The only one I got to the hole was the eagle on 15.  Everything else was right on line, but a foot short.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the conditions.   

 LUCAS GLOVER:  The greens I think were the same speed, very similar.   

 Personally, I wish it was 100 degrees, but it isn't.  You get pretty warm walking Augusta.   

 I'm going to go kick my feet up and beat the traffic home.
