  Q.  Were you happy with this?  Did you get everything out of it?   
 LUCAS GLOVER:  Absolutely, I really did.  Unfortunate birdie on the last.  I kind of put myself in jail over there to the left, but hit a pretty good shot and knocked in about a five-footer.   
 Played well, one mental mistake and one bad break.  Luckily it was on the same hole and the same shot.  That was my only bogey, played real solid and very pleased.   
  
  Q.  Where is your game now?  I mean, you've had some great weeks and you've had some weeks I'm sure you want to forget about.  Where is it right now?   
 LUCAS GLOVER:  Right now it's good because I kind of told myself just have fun this week, play golf.  This is my last of five in a row, and I've got next week off and one of those let-it-all-out weeks for me.  I eat too much, I don't sleep enough and golf happens to show up sometimes.   
 But I think everybody can say that in New Orleans.  That's why I love it.  It's just been inconsistent year, and that's the bottom line.  I played well at Augusta except for nine holes, and then I played as bad as I could possibly play last week.   
 It showed up this week, not hitting very good and then today just clicked.  Stupid game, really.  We'll try to figure it out again in the morning.
