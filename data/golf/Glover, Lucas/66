  Q. I now you're dejected. What happened on the backside?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: Didn't play good. Didn't make any putts. Just, you know, missed too many fairways and greens. I didn't make anything coming in. 3-over on the back. Don't win doing that.  
  
  Q. You made the turn, what was the feeling after 9, trying to control your emotions?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: Keep it going. I mean I didn't think that was going to be enough and, you know, I just hit bad shots and didn't make any putts. I got what I deserved.  
  
  Q. Looking ahead now, anything positive out of this week?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I played good. Made about a hundred birdies so putting good and I thought I hit some good putts coming in that bounced off line.   
 Last hole, for instance. But, you know, keep putting good and I got to hit a few more fairways and make some more birdies.
