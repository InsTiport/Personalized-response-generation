 Q.  For you to get that monkey off your back you talked about, what is going to be the key in executing a game plan today?  
GRAHAM DeLAET: Yeah, I think staying patient.  Even just today I was just telling Fred, I felt like I was playing pretty decent on the front nine and turned at 1-over, and I think in the past I would have kind of seen the leaderboard and noticed that I was -- I don't know what place I was in, probably 20th or something at the time, but I knew that I had lots of golf left.  My caddie did a great job and just told me to just focus on my breathing, just kind of settle down a little bit, and I was able to have a nice back nine and get myself right back into contention.  It's going to be fun tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to it.  Obviously I hope that it's finally the day, but more than anything, I just want to play well and kind of see how it all falls out.   
 Q.  Your strokes on the green looked very positive.  
LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, it's been good.  I haven't done the best reading the greens the last two days.  Strokes feel pretty good, but I'm having trouble reading the grain, and I'm misreading a bunch from 10, 15 feet.  My speed was off today, and I left a lot short.  But short ones have been solid.  That's been the hurdle the last few years, so pretty pleased.  I can't complain with where I stand.   
 Q.  How do you approach that final round with a chance to win?  
LUCAS GLOVER: I've got to get off to a good start.  I did the same thing again today, turned at 1-under, and tried to play catch-up some on the back.  Might have been pressing a little bit.  I don't think I've been more than 1-under through five or six holes all week, and the first few holes here are gettable, so I've got to focus on that tonight and just see some birdies and those first few holes.
