Q.   Nice birdie on the last, some challenging conditions out there, good round for you?
LUCAS GLOVER:   Thank you.   Yesterday and today, you don't move up very often on TOUR over par on the weekends, except for a place like this.   So very difficult wind, and just the golf course in general is hard.   And then to compound it with the wind and the pressure of a Saturday and a Sunday on TOUR, and I'm very pleased with how I finished.

Q.   You like the tough conditions, though, don't you? 
LUCAS GLOVER:   Yeah, I don't mind it.   I feel like when my short game is good and I'm hitting it like I'm supposed to, I can make a bunch of pars if I need to.   And I was able to do that these last two days, and you know, made some key putts and hit some key fairways. 

Q.   Good signs of your game this week, feeling positive heading forward?
LUCAS GLOVER:   Yeah, I've been working hard, working hard on my short game with Dave Stockton, Junior.   It came around today, or this week a little bit.   Still a work‑in‑progress, but I'm pleased.
