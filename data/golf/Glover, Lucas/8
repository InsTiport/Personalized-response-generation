Q. What a way to finish, put yourself right in position, and a long way to go still this afternoon, but you have to be so pleased with how you pulled that one off those last couple holes.
LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I hit some nice shots and finally got a couple to go in.  I played 16 pretty flawlessly and walked away with a par, and then the once on No. 17 and 18, 17 kind of snuck in the corner and 18 was drilled.  I couldn't be happier with doing it when I had to.
Q. Bogey-free this week on the Bear Trap, then you get that birdie at 17, and how about the emotional fist pump on 18; you knew what you had to do, and you did it.
LUCAS GLOVER: Well, I knew what I had to do at the time.  Things will change.  I think we've got five or six guys tied right now and a lot of drama out there, and 18 is playing downwind.  I've got a shot, that's all I can say and that's all I was trying to give myself coming down the stretch.
Q. What are you most proud of today, what you got out of that round?
LUCAS GLOVER: Wow, good question.  Those last two birdies.  I had my back against the wall early and looked like I was out of it and just kept fighting.  Bear Trap has bit me plenty, as everybody that's played here more than a few times has, and I played that little stretch great that week.  I'm pretty proud of that.  Just proud of the way I fought.  I fought hard today.  Greens are firm and fast, and it's blowing 20.  I'm just proud of myself the way I fought.
