  Q. Talk about your round out there. You finished third.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I played well, just two bogeys today, and both the putts were tough to make. The putter seemed to be working. I wish I could have hit some more greens and hit it closer to the hole, but all in all a good week.  
  
  Q. Talk about the conditions today. There's been some weather the last couple days.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: It softened up the greens for us. I played on the South Course Thursday. The greens were very firm, and when we played them on Saturday and Sunday they were soft. We were checking up 3- and 4-irons, stopping them. It was a little easier than they were Thursday just because of the green firmness, and they slowed down for us.   
  
  Q. Talk about your schedule looking ahead.  
 LUCAS GLOVER: I'm heading home tonight and I'll have a week off, and I'll be back in LA.  
  
  Q. You're in contention for the FedExCup right now.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, obviously it's a big goal. It's a year-long thing, and it's a big thing, so we'll see.
