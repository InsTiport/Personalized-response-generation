  Q. Talk about your round today and the conditions.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, it was good. Obviously conditions were worse, but one bogey around there on a rainy day, Saturday of a tournament, I'll take. I made some birdies, but I left some putts out there. Kind of a case of the lip-outs today. But I got a good break on 18 to make 4, so I'm pretty pleased with 2-under out there.  
  
  Q. Leaderboard is getting a little crowded on top there.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, well, best players in the world are going to play well, and you know, it's pretty impressive at the top. You've got Tiger and Padraig and Jerry Kelly and those guys are making a run. So they're not going to mess up, they're going to make birdies, so we've got to try to keep up.
