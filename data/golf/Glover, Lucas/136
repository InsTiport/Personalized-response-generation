Q.  Talk about your round today.
LUCAS GLOVER:  Well, birdied the first, bogeyed the second and then things kind of calmed down.  After 2 just trying to make some pars and get into a rhythm.  Did that, bad drive on 7, resulted in a bogey, and then had two really good shots on 9 and just missed a short birdie putt, but those two shots kind of gave me some confidence to get going.  I birdied 10, 11, 13, 14 to get it to 4, and then the bogey on 17 kind of hurt.  It won't be the only one there today.  Par on the last from the rough is good, and it's going to give me a good taste tonight.
Q.  Are you happy with a 69 today?
LUCAS GLOVER:  Absolutely.  This is a major championship golf course the way they've got it set up.  The greens are very firm, very fast, undulating, and the rough is tough.  Anything under par even in the 60s is a bonus.  So yeah, very pleased.
Q.  You said before you kind of like these golf courses better than the ones where you have to go out and make ten birdies.
LUCAS GLOVER:  Sure.  It's funny what you like about anything.  Personal preference is I like where you have to hit it straight and think a little bit, and you definitely have to do that here.  I hit a lot of 3 woods today.  I might have hit driver four times, maybe five, I don't remember.  But it is a thinking course because of how fast it's playing.
