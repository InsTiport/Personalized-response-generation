 Q. Let's talk about today. I followed you on the back side. I thought you played really well. 
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, it was solid. Just one hiccup there on 8 coming in, my 17th hole. But played well, made some putts, so pretty pleased.

 Q. On 8 you hit in the rough, the Kentucky bluegrass. It grabs the ball pretty good, doesn't it?
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, actually caught a good break. I was in somebody's divot, so actually had a decent lie, just -- I mean, I was 12 feet from the hole where my ball was, but in the rough and just hit a poor pitch, poor chip. But 66 around here after a couple weeks after, pretty pleased.

 Q. Talk about the weekend, obviously very pleased about the position you're in?
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, obviously there's going to be some more good scores this afternoon. There were more this morning, so that shows you how good a shape the course is in, the conditions we're having. But I played well, and we'll see what happens tomorrow and Sunday.

 Q. Do you like this place?
 LUCAS GLOVER: I do, I do, yeah. I like any place where a good shot gets rewarded and you've got to hit your ball around here.
