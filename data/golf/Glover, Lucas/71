   LUCAS GLOVER: I parred both par-5s going for the green and then parred 9 and 12. But you know, 5-under the first round at a major, I'll take it.  
  
  Q. Everything in your game seem to be in order right now?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I bladed a chip on 17, so I need to work on that. It was solid. I mean, it wasn't great, wasn't terrible, but I'll take it.  
  
  Q. What was it like playing with a guy shooting 63?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: You can't get caught up watching him. It was a heck of a round obviously, but he beat me by four, so that's how it felt.   
  
  Q. Did you spur each other on?   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, I was pulling for him on 17 because I had a feeling he'd birdie 18, and I thought to rewrite the record books would be pretty cool. But bad break on 17 he got with the lip-out, but that's a heck of a round.  
  
  Q. What are your thoughts on Rory's game?  
 LUCAS GLOVER: He drove it great, ironed it great, knocked in a bunch of putts and shot 63, just was a great round.  
  
  Q. Recently guys on Tour have said that you are maybe if not one of the best people to play with, you free them up, make them comfortable --  
 LUCAS GLOVER: I've got to quit doing that. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. Did you talk about the fact that he was close to the course record?   
 LUCAS GLOVER: No, you'd never mention that to happen. I'd never go up to him on 17 and say, hey, knock that in and birdie 18. You'd never do that. But I knew in the back of my mind if he made it on 17, that 18 was a birdie hole, and I was pulling for him.  
  
  Q. Talk about him being only 18.   
 LUCAS GLOVER: Yeah, 63 at St. Andrews, he's capable of just about anything.
