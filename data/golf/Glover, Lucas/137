Q. How close do you feel you have to be to have a chance?
LUCAS GLOVER:  Around here, within three or four, for sure.  Sunday doesn't yield a lot of low ones around here.  You've got to be in the right spot, because we're supposed to have some more wind.  So you're going to have to be pretty close to have a chance.
Q.  I would imagine you would like to win again?
LUCAS GLOVER:  Absolutely.  I don't think anybody out here is not.  I've been around it a little bit this year already.  Kind of close in San Diego and didn't get it done.  Tiger made a bunch of putts.
Q.  A win here in South Carolina would be a big success for you, as well?
LUCAS GLOVER:  I have a lot of home games here.  And Atlanta I didn't get to play this year; Charlotte, Augusta this year.  Anything close to home with the family and friends makes it more special.  This is one of my favorite trips, probably my top three courses on Tour, personal preference.  But just to be able to mix it up tomorrow will be a pleasure.
Q.  Do you feel like you're in the position you want to be?
LUCAS GLOVER:  I won't know until everybody finishes today.  You can make birdies on the back just as easily on the front, windy or not.  I think Jim and Aaron were playing extra special, so it just depends on what they do.  Just get home and get some rest and evaluate what we're going to do tomorrow.
