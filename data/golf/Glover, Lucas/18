Q. You just got out of getting treatment.  Talk me through what exactly happened with that fall and what was happening with your rehab.
LUCAS GLOVER: Just trying to hit a hard 5-iron, and right foot kind of slipped out from under me.  It was kind of -- going to grab something on the side of the slope and just gave out, and maybe I hyper extended it, not really sure exactly.  But had an ultrasound and all the exams, and nothing torn.  Just kind of a strained patellar tendon is what I'm being told by the guys a lot smarter than me.  Pretty lucky in that regard.
Scared myself as much as I hurt myself.  I didn't know whether to move it; if I could make it worse, or what.  Just didn't want to do anything stupider than I've under done.  Didn't want to mess up.
Q. What's the game plan looking forward to tomorrow?  And then obviously next week, the tournament starts on Friday.
LUCAS GLOVER: Game plan:  Make more putts.
Q. So you plan on playing tomorrow?
LUCAS GLOVER: Absolutely.  A bunch of ice tonight and come out tomorrow.  The guys in there feel pretty comfortable I'll be able to play.  Get a brace on it and I'll be fine.
