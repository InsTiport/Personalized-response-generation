Q.   Thoughts on this week?
THOMAS AIKEN:   Yeah, I can take a lot of positives out of the week.   I played some really nice golf.   There was some tough conditions during the week, everything from rain and wind to sunshine and wind. 
You know, I feel very happy with the way that I played.   I left a few putts out there during the week, a lot of short ones that I missed.   If those had of gone in, I could have been holding a trophy.   It's always good when you've played that well and unfortunately you just haven't got it done. 
Yeah, a lot to build on for the rest of the year.

Q.   It really is just small margins at times, isn't it, around here. 
THOMAS AIKEN:   Yeah, golf is a strange game.   That's why you don't see the same guys winning every week.   So it's very, very small margins and a little bit of luck here and there.   But overall if I look at my year so far, it's been very consistent and I can take a lot of positives away from that.   We are only, if not halfway through the year; so a lot of big tournaments left and excited about the rest of the year.
