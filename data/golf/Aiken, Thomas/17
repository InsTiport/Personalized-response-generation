Q.   Thomas, how good is 68 around here today? 
THOMAS AIKEN:   Yeah, I mean, we were first off this morning.   It's pretty cold out here when you get in in the morning and you warm up in the dark.   If you don't hit the fairways early on, the rough is quite tough because there's a lot of dew and it's quite sticky.   It's a little bit more difficult early on in the morning than when it warms up, but all in all, had a solid day again, and very happy with the score. 

Q.   You've been to Qatar often enough to know just what to expect from early mornings, but I guess it's still a shock to the system, isn't it? 
THOMAS AIKEN:   Yeah, I mean, I guess the weather this week is kind of strange, but we normally see a lot more wind.   I think the scoring is going to be a lot lower this year than normal, so looking good for the weekend. 
The greens are a hell of a lot better than what they have been in the past.   They have cut them down and got rid of some of the grain and the ball is really rolling nicely on them, so I think it's down to who sinks the most putts on the weekend. 

Q.   You read the grain pretty well, don't you? 
THOMAS AIKEN:   Yeah, I feel pretty comfortable, at least you know which way it's coming. 

Q.   Having started the year so nicely in Durban‑‑   is this a good continuation? 
THOMAS AIKEN:   Yeah, I've been playing nicely for the last six months, actually, from tee‑to‑green.   Just been struggling around the greens chips and putting. 
But I did quite a bit of work over December, and it seems to have turned around quite nicely and feeling a lot more confident and comfortable with the wedges and the putter.   So it tends to show in scores.   It's amazing how much the short game really does influence your score.
