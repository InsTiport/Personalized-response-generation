  Q. Your third round today, tell us how your game was today.   
 THOMAS AIKEN: Played solid again. Second day in a row I've made no bogeys, which is always good. Conditions were a little bit more benign today than the last two days, especially Thursday. And so there was a chance to get some birdies out there, but the greens really firmed up, and definitely a lot quicker than last two days.   
 The firmness of the greens made it a little tricky out there, but overall I was happy with the day.  
  
  Q. We are expecting a little more wind for tomorrow probably. What can we expect from you?  
 THOMAS AIKEN: Well, it blew on Thursday. I guess if it's going to blow again tomorrow, you've just got to stay patient and play each shot as it comes. There's not much else you can do. The elements are the element us and can't really fight them.   
 So just stay patient, keep the ball in play, and it's going to make it interesting if the wind really blows tomorrow.
