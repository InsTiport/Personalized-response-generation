 Q.  Your thoughts on 3-under today?  
THOMAS AIKEN: Yeah, it was a little tricky out there today.  The pins are quite tucked and there was a little bit of a breeze early on in the day.  Kind of calmed down towards the end.  All in all, I'll take what I got.   
 Q.  Just the one bogey on the card.  Puts you in strong position going into tomorrow.  
THOMAS AIKEN: Yeah, I see Wang played very well today.  I think he was 7-under.  He had a really good round.  It's not easy out there.  If you miss a fairway, you don't know whether it's going to come out hot or dead, so it's kind of a bit of guesswork.  But he's had a fantastic round of golf.   
Positioned nicely going into tomorrow.  Four shots back, well within range, and yeah, hopefully we get some breeze tomorrow and it makes things a little interesting.   
 Q.  Spoke to you yesterday, and you spoke that you want to try to pick up a win between now and Malaysia.  Good position for tomorrow now.  
THOMAS AIKEN: Yeah, put myself in good positions.  Tomorrow will be a nice one.  But you can't force the issue.  You have to go out and play your golf and at the end of the day, see what happens.  But yeah, nicely positioned and hopefully tomorrow is a good one.
