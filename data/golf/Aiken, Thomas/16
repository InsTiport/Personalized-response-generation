Q.   Thomas, what are your thoughts?   Presumably that birdie at the last makes it feel even better?
THOMAS AIKEN:   Nice to finally sink a long putt at the last.     It was a tough day out there today.   The wind was a little bit stronger than the last two days, and the pin placements were quite tough, as well. 
So I got off to a bit of a slow start with the first nine and made a couple of mental errors, but I hit the ball well the whole day and nothing outstanding, but very consistent and it was always nice to finish with 3â€‘under par the last nine holes.   So put myself in a good position going into tomorrow.

Q.   Were you conscious of nobody being able to pull away, but as long as you got something on the back nine, you're still there?
THOMAS AIKEN:   I didn't really look at the leaderboard much today.   Still a long way to go.   You're halfway through after yesterday and a lot of golf to be played so I just try to stick to the game plan and play the course the best that I could.   And unfortunately it was only 70 today but fortunately it puts me in a position with a chance to win tomorrow.   So job was well done today and then tomorrow is another day. 

Q.   You say chance to win.   Do you feel competitive?   Do you feel that the wind is around the corner? 
THOMAS AIKEN:   Definitely.   You want to win as many times as you can, so with you get an opportunity to do so, make it count.   So I'm looking forward to tomorrow, it will be a good challenge, and looks like there's quite a few of us around two shots, so should be an interesting day for the viewers, as well.
