 Q.   Talk us through the 9th.  
THOMAS AIKEN:   I hit a good 3‑wood off the tee.   I had 177 yards, pin was in the front and wind was a little bit off the left and a little bit helping.   So I just hit a soft 7‑iron and it looked good, as soon as I hit it, I was like, yeah, looks pretty good.   
It pitched.   Spun a little bit to the right and I couldn't really see from where I was, and the next thing I knew, the crowd went nuts and it went in the hole.   It's always nice to have one of those in your round.   That was great.   I had to try and calm myself down a bit after that.   
Then hit a pretty good 7‑iron on the next hole on 10 just behind the flag and made the putt.   Nice stretch of holes there.   Then on 12, I was just caught in between the yardage and it's a tough flag, back left flag and you only have about five paces to pitch the ball.   Unfortunately I hit it a little too far right and had too much spin on it and it spun to the middle of green and I 3‑putt and bogeyed.   
After that, it was solid until 15 and I had another 3‑putt bogey which was pretty poor, and then 16 is just to show you how this course can bite even at the best of times.   
I hit a great tee shot and what I thought was a good‑looking 9‑iron and it was two yards to the right and it pitched between the bunker and the green and I was pretty much dead from there.   So double‑bogey was very unfortunate but I played 17 all right and I played 18 very well and I birdied there.   
So all in all, if you said to me would you have taken 70 at the beginning of the day, I would have said probably.   Could have been a lot better.   It was very eventful.   Hopefully we can have the same round tomorrow without the bogeys.   
   
 Q.   And the point being, you expect up‑and‑downs around here, usually have them and you were really flying.   Were you conscious that you were top of the leaderboard for a while?  
THOMAS AIKEN:   No.   I didn't know at all.   I was just playing the golf course.   I mean, it's a tough golf course.   You've just got to keep playing it, and the first two days, I did very well.   
I think I only had four bogeys on my card the first two days, and I was going well up to 15 with only one today.   It's a course where you have to try and eliminate mistakes and I think the person that has the least mistakes generally wins around this course.   
Except I see Mr.BjÃ¶rn is doing his fire streak once more.   Yeah, I mean, happy with the first three days and who knows, maybe there's a 62 in there tomorrow.
