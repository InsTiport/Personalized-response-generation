  Q. This train keeps rolling on, so what's the verdict?  
 THOMAS AIKEN: To play solid golf again. Today I hit the ball the best I've hit in about a year today. I really hit the ball well. It's quite a demanding golf course off the tee, especially for me because I shape it left-to-right normally and many of the holes go right-to-left.   
 So I just tried to putt the ball in play off the tee and then hit some really good iron shots. I think I only missed one green, and that was the 15th, and it was by a foot. It was on the fringe and I could still putt. I hit every green and hit two par 5s in two. So put myself in the right positions to make a score, and made a few putts. Missed a few putts and ended up with a 67.  
 It was really good today. I really golfed the ball well. I can't think of any shot that I really put way out of position. So I really did hit it well, and no bogeys again. Name of the game.   
  
  Q. And your scorecard suggests there's a lot more opportunities on the way home. Most people found that, anyway?  
 THOMAS AIKEN: Yeah, the back nine, well, the back nine, there's three par 5s. There's a lot of scoring opportunity. And 17 is a good scoring opportunity, too.   
 So there are scores to be made, but the wind got up quite early in the afternoon and made things quite tricky on the end of the front nine there. So you just never know what the conditions are going to be here, it can change the golf course around.  
  
  Q. How are the energy levels?   
 THOMAS AIKEN: A little bit depleted. It's my sixth week in a row now, so it's been quite a bit. I've still got another two back home after this.   
 It's not over yet.   
  
  Q. And the hair keeps growing.   
 THOMAS AIKEN: Thanks. (Laughter)
