 Q. You must have had some fun out there. Excellent first round. 
 THOMAS AIKEN: I think I pretty much had really good fun. Golf course was not that easy. It's demanding, especially in iron shots and around the greens. 
 But I had a really good day today and enjoyed myself. 

 Q. Must be fair, though. You guys are posting a lot of low scores coming into the afternoon. 
 THOMAS AIKEN: Yeah, it is fair, so long as you hit it below the hole. If you hit above the hole, you can look stupid. The golf course is in unbelievable condition. I've never played golf at a place like this. The greens are really fast. Not as easy as it seems. 

 Q. Is this as fast as you've seen greens? 
 THOMAS AIKEN: Haven't played anything faster. 

 Q. Talk a little bit about your -- you had a good finish at the CA Championship. This was your only other event over here this year. You've been playing on the European Tour? 
 THOMAS AIKEN: Yes, I've actually been playing in the European Tour. That's been going really well. I've had 11 starts this year and six top ten finishes. Having a really nice year over there. I've been having fun. This is my only other week I've played out here.
 I enjoy it. The crowds are great. The golf courses are spectacular. I've always enjoyed it out here in America. Played a lot of junior and amateur golf over here. 

 Q. Do you have any other plans to play over here this year? 
 THOMAS AIKEN: I don't know what I can get into, but I would like to I'm playing my next qualifier for the U.S. Open next week. That's another possibility. 
 And other than that, nothing that I'm aware of. No, I'd like to play here more. I enjoy it.
