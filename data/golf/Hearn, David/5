 Q.  David Hearn, a nice round today.  Couple bogeys, but four birdies.  Talk a little bit about how you would assess your day.  
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, it was a pretty good day.  I had a nice day yesterday and felt like I got off to a great start.  Putted really, really well.  Today I didn't putt quite as well, but I wasn't giving myself as many chances either.   
Felt nice to make a few birdies on my back nine.  I'm in a good spot for the weekend.  That's the most important thing.  Couple of good days and see what happens.   
 Q.  Now, did you think that the conditions were a little bit more difficult today than yesterday?  Perhaps you might have gotten the good side of the draw.  
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, you never know.  We'll find out at the end of the day as far as how that goes.  I think that getting going this morning we had it pretty calm.  Definitely had some nice weather.  I think later in the day it's going to get tricky.   
Compared to yesterday I don't know if it was harder today or not, but I am just trying to stay one hole at a time right now.   
 Q.  Well you're in good position approaching the weekend.  Thanks for stopping by.  
DAVID HEARN: Thank you.
