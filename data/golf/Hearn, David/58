   DAVID HEARN: I got off to a real good start on the back nine today. Birdied the first hole, and hit a bunch of fairways and greens getting going. I turned to the front side and started missing the fairways and out here you're going to pay for that.   
 Overall, though, I shot even. I'm pretty happy with that. I think any day I come in even I'm going to be a happy man. So off to a good start and looking forward to tomorrow afternoon.  
  
  Q. You played the U.S. Open before. Is this the kind of the same demanding test?   
 DAVID HEARN: Yeah, absolutely. All the guys I've talked to, it's as close as you're going to get to a U.S. Open style. The rough is thicker this year than the last time we were here. I remember it was long in 2005, but I think the course is a little bit drier this year. It's definitely pretty hard.   
 I had some lies that looked pretty good, and I had trouble with them. It's just, it's tricky.  
  
  Q. How would you compare, Shaughnessy, David, to Hamilton or Glen Abbey as far as an Open venue?   
 DAVID HEARN: Yeah, they're all great Open venues. I mean, the Canadian Open, being our National Championship, they do a great job setting it up and making it great for all the players. But this particular golf course is as hard as we're going to get at the Canadian Open.   
 At Glen Abbey and Hamilton and courses like that, I think they lend themselves to a few more birdies than out here. It's always just fun to play.  
  
  Q. You've got four rounds of even par, would you be happy?   
 DAVID HEARN: I'd take it. Our goal here is to obviously compete to win. But I'm a realist too. I think I'd take par and even.
