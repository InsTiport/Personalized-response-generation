Q. David, that back nine was impressive.  I know it started with that hole out from 195 at the 10th, and then you roll in that 30, 35-footer at 18.
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, you know, it was fun on the back nine there.  I missed a couple of shorter putts on 8 and 9, and I just said to my caddie, let's see if we can get it going real quick again on the back nine.
Obviously, real lucky to see that one go in on 10.  It was a good shot.  Any time you hole a shot from 200 yards is a little bit of luck.  I made some nice solid birdies after that.
I can't be more happy with my start this week.  I'll see if I can follow it up with some more birdies tomorrow.
Q. How about that putt on 18?  That was not easy.  You came in from the right and went right in the center of the hole there with some big break.
DAVID HEARN: That's just what you get out here at Muirfield.  You can hit some real quality shots, but you got to make some good putts.  I had a putt on 17, it was only about 12 feet with 4 feet of break.
And then on 18, I was playing 6 or 8 feet of break on that 30-footer.  You just got to make a few of those on your good days.  That's what you expect when you come out here.  It's a fun course to play.
Q. That hole-out from 200 yards, what did you hit there?
DAVID HEARN: 5.
Q. 5 iron?
DAVID HEARN: Yeah, played it up the ridge, and it all the way back down to the hole.  One of those shots you see out here.  It was fun.
